0439023513|5.0|An excellent culmination to the Hunger Games trilogy--fast-paced, exciting, and full of twists. Fans of the first two books will not be disappointed! In Book 3, Katniss has survived the Quarter Quell and is now a hugely important emblem for the rebel's cause in District 13. Katniss must submit to becoming the Mockingjay if the revolution is to be successful--but what cost will being the Mockingjay have on her relationships and her life?<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first two books in the Hunger Games series, this one will close out the series with a bang (or several, actually!) for you. Our favorite characters are back for a plot-driven novel, with very little further characterization (though it's not needed at this point). Loved nearly everything about this final chapter in the saga--definitely shed a few tears however! I highly recommend this if you've already read Books 1 and 2!
B005LAIH5O|3.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Wrath of the Titans picks up 10 years after Clash of the Titans. The gods have lost control.<br />Zeus (Liam Neeson) traveled to Tartarus with his brothers Hades, Poseidon and Ares. Zeus seeks peace.<br />The young Ares will have nothing of it and imprisons Zeus and steals his Thunderbolt.<br />Hades and Ares have teamed up to drain Zeus of his power.<br />If you're lost, get a set of Cliff's notes on Greek mythology, or just sit back and enjoy the special effects. There will be a lot of them. Starting with the attack of the Chimera, a monsterous fire-breathing two-headed creature.  It has the body of a lion, one head of a goat and a combination head/tail of a snake. I told you.<br />Don't worry Perseus (Sam Worthington), Zeus' son kills one of the beasts, and then sets forth to save his father and the world.<br />Part of his mission is to Hephaestus, who created three great weapons that Zeus' Thunderbolt, Hades' Pitchfork, and Poseidon's Trident, and that together they form the Spear of Triam. That's the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. Kronos is the one Ares and Hades hope to revive.<br />While they are on Hephaestus' island they are attacked by three Cyclopes. A Cyclope is a race of giants, each with a single eye in the middle of his forehead.<br />The story is weak. The effects are great. You choose.<br />Filming took place in studios outside London and later shot on location in Surrey, South Wales and in the Canary Islands.
0545123275|3.0|3.5 stars: It took me quite a while to sink into this one, but once I did, I really enjoyed it. The story alternates between the perspectives of Grace, a teenage girl who feels a strong kinship with the wolves who live behind her house, and Sam, a teenage boy leading a double life as a human and wolf. Sam and Grace finally connect, and fall in love swiftly, but can they stop Sam's inevitable transformation into a wolf from becoming permanent? Stiefvater did a nice job alternating voices--both Sam and Grace sound like (eloquent!) teenagers, without being too 'angst-y.' For teen fans of paranormal romance, this book will speak to you. If you're just not into paranormal romance, chances are this is not the book for you! And for fans of Twilight, sorry! No vamps here...but if you're willing to give wolves a try, you may end up liking this one! Also, FYI teachers and parents: this is a book clearly intended for older teens (I would say 16 and up, but use your judgment), as there are sexual themes and situations within this book.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Utilitarian robot boy from Earth meets technologically sleek robot girl from space and it's love at first sight. Love in the future is awkward. No one seems to know how to communicate without the use of electronics anymore. It's even strained and challenging for the metallic robots! Wall-E doesn't give up on his true love EVE though and he follows her to the end of the universe, or at least back to the main spaceship. The spaceship is the new home for humans who have evacuated planet Earth because the environment is over polluted and is uninhabitable. Not even a potato plant will grow in the nutrient poor soil anymore. The refugees from Earth rely on machines for pretty much everything including transportation and don't even bother to walk on their own legs. When EVE's precious find is discovered, everything goes topsy turvy.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I am surprised that Disney considered this movie a flop. It was one of the best movies that I have seen in a while. Most movies taking place on Mars are terrible. But the story of this movie is excellent. I am hoping for a sequel. The marketing for this movie by Disney must have been pretty bad. I hadn't heard of the movie until I rented it on Apple TV (the previews looked good). I liked it so  much that I bought the 3D Blu ray combo from Amazon, the next day. The 3D version is very much worth it. I have watched it a few times and I still find it good each time. I rarely watch movies more than once, it has be to be very good for me to that.

B000VEA30W|4.0|The 5 man group from Huntington Beach, CA returns after about 2 years to bring you their 5th group album, which is a lot being they are only in their mid 20's.  I don't have all of their albums as I'm somewhat new to the band, but of the 4 that I do have (their newer albums, I'm still getting to the older ones), I have not been disappointed.  My favorite is still their newest album \\"Nightmare\\" but this self titled album is pretty good as well.  Of the 10 songs on here, 2 are real good but not quite classic material, there are about 3 I'd say are average, the other 5 are good songs.  Like a lot of the older stuff they put out, it's harder and more upbeat throughout the album and they stay true to their longer songs, with quite a few clocking in over 5 minutes long.

B00005JLCI|3.0|No other movie version of Hamlet has ever encompassed the whole play before, and that in itself is an achievement, and no other seems to rake up such a huge A list cast either, which is cool and interesting to watch, if a bit distracting at times. I know this movie is well loved, but maybe it's just my own personal taste, but I really do not care for this version very much. I absolutely love the play. No joke either, I think it's the greatest thing ever written. But this movie...<br /><br />First of all, there's the time period of the movie. Branagh chose to set his version of Hamlet in the 1800s. Interesting, but (And this is a matter of complete personal taste here, but I'm sure someone else has to agree with me.) I hate it when Shakespeare movies don't take place where the original play had them set. You know, like medieval, Renaissance times. (I hate Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet for this very reason.) Maybe it works here, but I just don't care for it. Not to mention the sets of the movie are bright and colorful, and though this works in some scenes, like Hamlet's first entrance when he is the only one in black, the rest of the time, it seems jarring to the tone of the play. Hamlet is a dark play, and the colors, though pretty, just don't reflect that.<br /><br />Then there is Kenneth Branagh himself who not only directed the piece, but also starred as Hamlet (Emphasis on the Ham part of Hamlet.) You know, I know about another actor who directed/starred in a movie version of Hamlet. His name was Sir Laurence Olivier. Branagh even dyed his hair blonde to fit the image of a Dane. Huh. kind of like Laurence Olivier did.<br /><br />And honestly, that is the thing I hate most about this movie version of Hamlet. Everytime I watch it, I feel like Branagh is trying to beat Olivier. It's like he's saying \\"Ha ha! I filmed the whole play! Ha ha! My version is more epic than yours!\\" And the moment where this can be seen the most is when Hamlet is about to kill Claudius.I watch Olivier's Hamlet and I see him leap at Claudius, so epically. Then I watch Branagh's and I see him throw a sword at Claudius, THEN throw a chandelier at him, before force feeding him poison. Okay Branagh. I think that was a little over the top there, and frankly, stupid. And yet, just seeing Olivier's relatively simple swan dive at Claudius is thousands of times more chilling an powerful.<br /><br />So as you could probably tell, I am a huge fan of Olivier, and I think his portrayal of Hamlet is leagues better than Branagh's. Olivier had a quiet danger about him. His Hamlet is broody and introverted, yet there is still and unhinged quality deep inside of him. Then I look at Branagh's Hamlet, and all I see is a wacko psycho lunatic. I am afraid of Olivier's Hamlet. I want to punch Branagh's in the face.<br /><br />Of course though, Branagh will have one up on Olivier because he filmed the whole play, and to such a huge scale. Branagh showed us all of the facets to Hamlet, including the wittier side that Olivier had to cut due to time restraints. I'll be the first to admit the Olivier film is dated, and the Oedipus complex that he plays up won't sit well these days with the modern audience. Branagh's film is certainly more accessible to English students reading the play in class nowadays. I'd even say that Branagh's supporting cast makes up for his hammy performance. My personal favorites are Kate Winslet as Ophelia and Billy Crystal as the gravedigger. Charlton Heston was wonderful too. Although on the other hand, the cast is distracting. Such a big name French superstar as Gerard Depardieu in one scene was kind of ridiculous, as was Sir John Gielgud and Dame Judi Dench for what, their fifteen seconds of screen time? It was distracting. Another thing I like about Branagh's film is that he also shows us things we can't actually see in an actual play. Hamlet courting Ophelia, and Yorick the fellow of infinite jest, as well as flashbacks of Claudius killing the King. So even though I dislike Branagh's performance and time period, the supporting cast and flashback scenes can make me sit through the movie, even though I can see Branagh going \\"Na nanannnaa!\\" to Olivier the whole time for one-upping him. (I don't know, is that just me?) Though I don't like this movie, I can see why others may.<br /><br />In the end, I'd say Olivier is the better Hamlet by far, but Branagh has the better rest of the cast. As your first intro into Hamlet I'd say skip both and read the play first, but if you have to see it performed to fully 'get it' as it were, watch the Branagh version simply because it's the whole dang play. However, if your looking for a better FILM, not to mention better performance by a leading actor, watch the Olivier.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|After having heard about this book from numerous people, I decided to buy it before going on a trip to Europe. I'm not intimately familiar with Tina Fey but what I have seen her in (Mean Girls, Saturday Night Live), I've loved her and think she is absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />Fey's book simply does not disappoint. Although not as hilarious as I may have hoped, her anecdotes, stories, and advice make for a great, if quick, read. By the time I had finished the book, I was wishing it went a bit longer and I'm hoping for more books from Fey as well as some of her contemporaries such as Amy Poehler. Definitely buy!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Lots of cool twists here make for a lightweight, but pleasant, experience. Johnny Depp and Joli make an odd pairing, but it does seem to work. They have chemistry. It's a little taste of James Bond, updated, yet with the air of thorwback. The violence is never gruesome, thankfully. There's a lot of comedy here, as well.

B000VSYDRM|5.0|This movie is so weird. I tried to watch it once years ago and couldn't get through it. I just watched it again and was fascinated by it.<br /><br />By the end, all I could think was \\"What did I just watch???\\"<br /><br />Professor Snape was in it.<br /><br />Give it a whiff.
0345803485|1.0|First, let me start by saying that as a practicing S&M Lifestyler and a cheerfully proud submissive, when I heard about this book, I was excited beyond MEASURE. And then I tried to read the book. Key word: \\"tried.\\"<br /><br />Before I read a book, I do a \\"first page test.\\" Thank you to my first editor who taught me the importance of hooking the reader at the first paragraph.  This book not only didn't hook me, it totally alienated me. The \\"high\\" language I used in my 9th grade papers was enough for me to say, \\"Oh, I'm not buying this.\\"<br /><br />And then I kept getting slapped in the face with the doggone thing! At work, on TV, EVERYWHERE people wee talking about how good it was. So, I tried yet AGAIN0, to read it.  THIS time, I borrowed it from a friend (I could not, in good conscience pay this woman for writing this crap, or her editor, who should be hung, drawn and quartered).<br /><br />On to the review...which I will be quite simple. As others have said, this book had to have been written by a girl in high school...make that middle school (I wrote better than this in high school). If the repetitious phrasing, words and imagery (if you can call anything in this book \\"imagery,\\" it's so thinly crafted)doesn't bore you, then the absolutely ridiculous way this woman talks (even in her own head...who actually TALKS like that, really?) will make you want to bludgeon yourself.  I, personally, wanted to bite my own eyes out after one chapter (even attempted it a few times, did you know that's impossible?). And I simply cannot finish this book. I just can't.  It's quite possibly the most terribly, horrendously written thing I've ever read.<br /><br />I'm aggravated, because I wanted to see what she did with the S&M aspect and to test how well she covers the lifestyle in this relationship, but I'm pretty sure that it will be like the rest of the book: surface-level, poorly fleshed out, banal and irritating.
0743298020|2.0|This is a classic gothic story, complete with ghost sightings, secret loves, mistaken identities and multiple levels of narrative to tell the tale. As such, it accomplishes its artifice quite well. The writing, which can sometimes be very lyrical, is a delight to read.<br /><br />It suffers, however, from a convoluted plot and a lack of compelling characters. With its requisite moody atmosphere and unpredictable weather, this story borrows from well-known classics of English Literature, such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, among others. But opposite those novels, The Thirteenth Tale fails to get the reader to intimately know any of the characters. Hester Barrow seems compelling enough, and her relationship with Dr. Maudsley elicits enough curiosity to wish for a deeper treatment of their story, but they, too, come short.<br /><br />Because of this, and despite all the twists, and turns and surprises, the novel falls flat. Two stars for the lyrical language and the gothic atmosphere.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great collection of mostly-original games. Most games are simple in concept, but a bit more difficult in practice, which makes for a fun time overall. The variety is fantastic, so it's not all the same kind of game (like a card game pack, for example). The biggest bother I have found is the ads that come up after most games, but it makes sense and you are offered in-game points for completing them (like a prompt for a review in exchange for a good deal of points), so it's able to be overlooked.

B003ZW0MPS|5.0|Like many others, I became attracted to this band by the NPR/Youtube \\"raw\\" clips which are *not* contained on this album. Some people are upset by that but I actually prefer the album cuts.<br /><br />The band sings well together although obviously Trixie is the star vocalist. I didn't know that Daniel Lanois could play guitar like this! Raw and edgy and at times some almost Hendrix-like sounds. Superb drumming here (and the drums themselves sound great) and the bass is prominent and upfront, not buried and muddy. The bass playing is excellent as well. Sonically, the album just sounds fantastic and IMO every song is enjoyable, not one throwaway.<br /><br />Production is first rate and the sound from the vinyl is gorgeous. If you have a nice system you are really going to enjoy this. Sturdy gatefold jacket and silent, thick, shiny discs...the way it should be. The songs are spread generously over three sides with the fourth being a really cool etching including a band logo. My copy did not include a download code.

B008JH5CVS|3.0|Wow I wanted to give up within the first 20 minutes hoping for a better finish than start.  However, I watched the whole movie and sadly it never came.  This would have been a good movie a few months after Star Wars but everyone would still have been going to see Star Wars another time and long forgotten this movie. The FX were for not.  The protagonists were predictable all within the first 20 minutes.  The conflict was predictable and humorous seconds before they arrived. Bummer for the studios that financed this soon-to-be-forgotten film.  Learn from your mistakes least you repeat them...
B003Y5H5B0|3.0|Back in the 80s there was a TV series that helped kick off the new network known as FOX. It starred a bunch of new actors just getting noticed and featured them as policemen who went undercover in high school to fight crime among the younger generation. Among these actors was a guy named Johnny Depp who you may have heard of. Depp eventually left and the show finally finished but has developed a cult following. Enough of one that they apparently decided a remake in feature length format was warranted. But don't go in thinking this is the same old 21 JUMP STREET.<br /><br />Jonah Hill plays Schmidt, the smart, nerdy kid who wants to be liked so much so that he dies his hair blonde and cuts it to look like Eminem. Jenko (Channing Tatum) is his high school nemesis, the jock that doesn't think much and picks on the nerd. For one reason or another both find themselves unable to go to prom.<br /><br />Fast forward to find both of them applying to become policemen at the academy. They become friends and each uses their strengths to help the other one graduate. Thinking they'll be hitting the streets and stopping crime they're stunned to find themselves on bicycle duty. When they see a biker gang involved in a drug deal they think that will all change. It does but not the way they hoped. Having failed to read the criminals their Miranda rights, the only way to avoid being kicked out is to work in a special outfit.<br /><br />The Jump Street program is headed by tough as nails Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube). It takes youthful looking police officers and places them in high schools to fight crime. In this particular incident they're trying to find the supplier of a new drug in schools that's already resulted in one teen death. Now the two cops who didn't fare well in high school are going back.<br /><br />But things aren't like they were. The things that made Jenko popular are now frowned upon by the cool kids. And the nerdy things that Schmidt did are now making him popular. It gets even more twisted up when the duo get their undercover identities mixed up and Jenko is supposed to be the smart one while Schmidt is the jock! Couple that with the fact that the kids think Jenko looks much older than his \\"age\\" and you can see where this is going.<br /><br />What you end up with is a bit of a twist on the Odd Couple tossed in with an attempt by two twenty somethings trying to fit in. They must also find the dealers of the drugs and then follow up to see who their supplier is. Along the way they each have the chance to walk in the other's shoes from the past and with any luck will appreciate each other more after doing so.<br /><br />The movie is filled with the gross out or inappropriate humor Hill is becoming known for but not to the extent that it distracts from the story or hinders it (like happened with THE SITTER). The bonding between these two characters and the chance that it will unwind makes for an interesting film as does the chance for Schmidt to finally get the chance to have a decent high school experience. Except that he isn't a student and almost falls into the trap of getting too involved in his undercover identity.<br /><br />There are plenty of laughs and a few decent action sequences. My favorite laugh involved a chase scene where things that would normally explode in any other movie don't. In addition to the story laced with humor we get some decent cameos by members of the original series including Holly Peete Robinson, Peter DeLuise and Depp himself (though you'll never recognize him until he wants you to). It's not a bad movie and one I can actually see myself watching again down the line. Entertaining and light fare, this is a movie that will give you just what you expect.ts even more twisted up when the duo get their undercover identities mixed up and Jenko is supposed to be the smart one while Schmidt is the jock!

B00782O7NE|5.0|There are many who would have been stunned when they heard that a silent movie won for best picture in 2012 at the Oscars. Okay I admit I was one of those people. But after having had the chance to see the film it made me think that perhaps Hollywood granted the award for two reasons: one, because it is a great film and two, because it is a love note to the Golden Age of Hollywood.<br /><br />The film is about the career of silent screen idol George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a swashbuckling/dancing/sly grinned matinee idol if there ever was one. When the film starts George is at the top of his game and the biggest box office draw around. Along with his pet pouch he's the talk of the town and a hit with everyone.<br /><br />One day while signing autographs he literally bumps into a young woman named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo). At first surprised he passes it off with a laugh and the two go on their way. Except that now the press is all abuzz wondering who this mystery woman is, something that Mrs. Valentin (Penelope Ann Miller) isn't pleased with.<br /><br />As the film progresses the paths of George and Peppy cross once more when they meet on the set of his next film where she's an extra. They playfully dance back and forth much to the displeasure of the head of the studio (John Goodman). When he attempts to toss her off the lot, George steps in and defends her. This is much to her good fortune as the roles she receives increase and her popularity grows as well.<br /><br />The same can't be said of George. When Goodman shows him the latest thing to hit Hollywood, sound, George laughs it off and gloats that he's never needed sound to reach and audience. When the studio switches to sound only, George is tossed aside as old. He promises to show them how great silent films are by starring in, directing, writing and producing his next film. Opening the same day as the new Peppy Miller film, it draws a few people against the lines waiting to see her film.<br /><br />Down and out and nearly penniless after the stock market crash, George's wife leaves him. Only his trusted chauffer Clifton (James Cromwell) stays by his side until George finally fires him due to no money with which to pay him. George sells off everything he has and finds little to keep him going.<br /><br />At the same time the fortunes of Peppy Miller are skyrocketing. Little known to George so are her emotions for him. It will only be a matter of time before these star crossed lovers finally meet once more.<br /><br />It seems like such a simple story, perhaps a bit of A STAR IS BORN, tossed in as well. But this is no remake and yes, the story is quite simple. But that doesn't make it the least bit boring. Instead it's a tremendous piece of storytelling that makes the viewer use their eyes to get the story. The music enhances the action on the screen just as it was in the silent era. The composition of what we are viewing is something we could take for granted or perhaps we have the chance to see how visually stimulating it can be, even in black and white.<br /><br />The film ends with a dance number straight out of the old Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers playbook. Unfortunately there will be far too many viewers who won't even know who Astaire and Rogers were which is kind of sad because there are so many great movies that just aren't the thing these days. Younger viewers ignore films that are black and white. They have no desire to watch a film that is \\"silent\\" (even though the score to this movie is fantastic). It's much easier to watch a movie with tons of explosions or sparkling vampires than it is to invest oneself in a love story like this one.<br /><br />That's a big loss for this generation. They don't know about the high flying adventures of Captain Blood or the deeply romantic loss felt by Rick in a town named Casablanca. They'll never know the charm of Nick and Nora Charles as they solve crimes or the horror displayed by an actor named Karloff. This movie might change that though. Perhaps after watching and enjoying this film the younger generation might be interested enough to seek out those classics. One can only hope. And if not, at least they'll be entertained by this film. It deserved the attention it received.ght change that though.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Of the 10-15 books on fitness and muscle building that I've read over the years, this one is probably the best. It's very convincing and informative and gets right to the point. I thought I already knew 90% of what there was to know, but this book convinced me I was making some mistakes and missing out on some low hanging fruit. By itself, the section on supplements justifies the purchase price of the book many times over.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that as Denzel Washington gets older he's playing more and more characters with killer instincts? In SAFE HOUSE, Washington once more plays a character that you hope you never find tracking you down or waiting in your home.<br /><br />The film opens with Washington meeting a member of MI6, Britain's spy agency, and receiving a microchip filled with information. Heading to the bathroom of the restaurant they're in, he injects it into his hip. When the bad guys come knocking on the restroom door Washington dispatches them with ease and escapes. The MI6 agent picks him up in his car but before they can get away he's shot. Washington makes his escape to the American consulate and turns himself in.<br /><br />We discover that Washington's name is Tobin Frost, an ex-CIA agent who went off the grid and has been selling secrets to various organizations around the world. Considered a traitor, the consulate turns out to be in South Africa and he's to be taken to a safe house until a team can get to him and \\"extract\\" information from him.<br /><br />The safe house is operated by a fairly new agent named Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). It's his first assignment with the CIA and he wants to impress, to move forward. He gets his chance when the information team arrives closely followed by the hit squad that was chasing Frost to begin with. They take out the team but before they can take Frost, Weston escapes with him only to be tracked down. They eventually escape but you know this assassination team will eventually find them.<br /><br />Calling in, Weston is told that he needs to move forward to another location and pick up the means necessary to get Frost to another safe house in South Africa. After picking up the package with various items he needs at lockers in a crowded soccer stadium, Frost causes a scene claiming he's been kidnapped. The security believes him and ignores Weston's pleas only to have Frost kill his guards and escape. Weston follows suit and continues his chase of Frost.<br /><br />But there's more going on here than a simple chase film. The movie is also about what caused Frost to become who he is today and watches as Weston alters from a totally innocent and naive agent into something much more deadly. The fact that Frost has a background in psychological warfare makes the viewer wonder is he just trying to mess with Weston's head or is he trying to help he get a view of the bigger picture? The answer to that question isn't offered until near the end of the film.<br /><br />Another question that runs through the film is the fact that somewhere in the CIA there is a traitor. How is it that the assassination team knew where the safe house was? How have they been able to track down Frost as he moves from place to place? And who gave them the information that led them to him at the beginning of the film? As viewers we wonder about these questions. As a participant, Weston must try and find the answers to these questions as well, never knowing who is an ally or foe.<br /><br />The film moves at a frantic pace with tons of car chases, gun fights and hand to hand combat sequences. Unlike the spy films of the past, people actually get shot, stabbed and bleed. There is a touch more realism here than spy films past. But that goes hand in hand with the story of undeserved loyalty and questions of deciphering who exactly the bad guy is.<br /><br />Washington has never been better. There are subtle plays at work here he delivers that make you wonder if Frost is good, bad or indifferent. The answer is found by the end of the film. Reynolds does an equally great job portraying an innocence in his character that gets jaded as the film progresses. How he ends up, what he will become is also answered by the end of the film.<br /><br />Most films like these today are compared less with Bond and more with Jason Bourne. This film is grittier than the Bourne films and much more so than the Bond series.It will hold your attention and have you guessing from start to finish as to what is actually on the microchip that Frost has possession of. It delivers the goods from start to finish an is well worth taking the time to sit back, watch and enjoy.It will hold your attention and have you guessing from start to finish as to what is actually on the microchip that Frost has possession of.

1612680011|3.0|This is a good book to start with.  It opens your mind and begins the financial education process.  The book is out of date and some of his ideas may have worked back in the 80s and 90s however post 2000 I would be hesitant in following his direction.  The general purpose is clear and valuable however his tips on when, where, how, and why are way out of date (he admits that his examples are what he did and what he knows...not what you should do).<br />I encourage people to read this book to learn and open their minds however I also encourage people to do further research and reading.  He has a great list of suggested reading, and those authors also have lists of suggested reading.  Keep learning and also go out there and try some of these techniques!  You've got to fall off the bike a few times when learning how to ride it.
B005LAIH9K|4.0|One of the first movies in the teen gross out genre was AMERICAN PIE. The movie was funny, had some jokes that a few people might find offensive and on the whole was quite entertaining. It was followed by a few lackluster sequels that never quite got the whole gang together again. So it's nice to see that everyone has come back for the reunion. AMERICAN REUNION that is.<br /><br />Believe it or not it's been 13 years since we the teens in the series graduated and moved on. Yes, we know that Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and Jim (Jason Biggs) got married (one of the sequels). Jim works at a good job and they have a son now. What they don't have is an interesting sex life, the crux of their problem in this film.<br /><br />What's up with everyone else? Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is in love with a working woman and about ready to tie the knot himself. He works at home as an architect and the couple tend to do more things that interest her than him but he's content. Oz (Chris Klein) is a sports announcer in LA whose girlfriend seems to be far more off the beaten path than he might like. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is a mystery with rumors of him traveling the world. And Stiffler (Seann William Scott) remains Stiffler, the ever adolescent party man who works as a temp assistant to a tyrannical boss.<br /><br />All of these friends have kept in touch and seen one another from time to time, but this year they've decided to get together for their thirteenth class reunion. Not only that they're coming into town early to just get in touch with one another again. They omit Stiffler from the gathering but he finds his way to them anyway. And it's Stiffler that is the same as he was 13 years ago and who pulls them into their past.<br /><br />The set ups for various jokes work well into the storyline. Going to the beach they all enjoyed when they were teens they do what all responsible adults do, they get drunk. This leads to a prank Stiffler finds hilarious and the others consider a little immature.<br /><br />The little girl that Jim babysat while in high school is all grown up in every way imaginable and Jim can't believe his eyes. When she gets drunk at a party he takes her home only to have her hit on him. With the help of his friends he just might get her in the house without her parents finding him.<br /><br />A party Stiffler throws is not quite what he expected with people from work more suit and tie with a bottle of wine than T shirt and keg. His party seems boring until he gets things rolling. This sequence has one of the funniest yet grossest jokes in it.<br /><br />Misunderstandings and final reconciliations are in order and the movie does have a happy ending. No not one of THOSE happy endings although Jim's dad (Eugene Levy) does bring that up in a conversation. His story is one of the funniest as well as Jim's dad finds possible romance with Stiffler's mom. In any event there was never any doubt that the film would provide us with a happy ending and leave it open for another sequel and that might be a good thing. It's interesting to watch these teens grow into adults and see how they deal with one another as they change.<br /><br />Amazingly enough the center piece of the film is the life of Stiffler. He misses the old days and while he may have been a jerk to the rest of the characters, he actually loved them as well. They were important to him and meant something to him. On his own he has little to feel good about but with these friends in tow he finds that person that's been missing since graduation.<br /><br />The acting seen here is natural but then again these are characters that the actors should by now be very comfortable with. It's nice to see them reprise the roles that actually started some of their careers. Each one displays the character at a different time in their life and does it well.<br /><br />For me the clincher to these movies and to the gross out raunchy teen films in general is was I entertained? I can honestly say yes, this movie does indeed entertain. It made me laugh. It made me care for characters I hadn't watched in some time. It made me reminisce about my high school years as well. It's nice to see a movie that one would place in a niche category swing about and complete so many more. Don't sell this movie out. It's well worth taking the time to see.stly say yes, this movie does indeed entertain. It made me laugh. It made me care for characters I hadn't watched in some time.

B007MG360G|4.0|its awesome but not as good as the DS game Percy Jackson and the Olympians,The Lighting Theif the video game
B007IQX1G4|1.0|This  was the most boring, and messed up movie I have seen. I think there were maybe one or two laughs in the entire movie. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1400052181|4.0|I've been hearing about how amazing this book is pretty much since day one.  It's been discussed on book blogs and podcasts and it seems that everyone who reads it loves it. So of course I had to read it and see for myself.<br /><br />Prior to reading the book I was already aware of the story of Henrietta Lacks, at least the scientific details.  But of course not much is known about her personal life and her family which are at the core of the book.  The book explores who she was as a person, as well as the children she left behind and how the discovery of the existence of HeLa cells has affected their lives.<br /><br />Overall this was a very gripping read.  I was afraid it would be boring and scientific but it wasn't in the least.  Rebecca Skloot did a great job of mixing in the science parts with personal touches and keeping the story moving.  It was interesting to read about the legal and moral issues around cells because this is something I'd never heard of or even thought about.  I didn't know cells were such a big industry.<br /><br />But mostly I really felt for the family of Henrietta Lacks who were deprived information and felt manipulated.  Although the HeLa cells have helped science so much, it's important not to forget where they came from and it's a shame that her family wasn't informed and treated respectfully.  Hopefully the awareness this book raises will mean that others who have their cells taken in the future will fare much better.

0812992792|5.0|I first heard about The Orphan Master's Son from Books on the Nightstand and was immediately intrigued because it's set in North Korea, a place I find mysterious and fascinating.  After starting it, though, I found it really hard to get into the book.  It wasn't what I was expecting and it's pretty long.  But I'm glad I stuck with it because in the end it was incredibly powerful.<br /><br />When you pick up this book, you will step into a world of such outlandish things as:<br /><br />Party Aptitude Tests<br />Rightness of Thinking evaluations<br />The Glories of Science Museum<br />Redeemability farms<br />Testament to the Greatness of Machines Factory<br />The Evils of Capitalism classes<br />Juche Theory<br />Self-Criticism Pavilions<br />The Museum of Socialist Progress<br />Songs entitled \\"Our Quotas Lift Us Higher\\"<br />The rules of good citizenship: Devote Yourself Eternally to Our Glorious Leaders, Treasure Criticism, Obey Songun Policies, Pledge Yourself to Collective Child Rearing, and Conduct Regular Martyrdom Drills<br /><br />These things helped construct the world of North Korea and really set the atmosphere.  Some of them sound almost laughable but when they are spoken of in The Orphan Master's Son, it is with seriousness because they are simply a part of life.<br /><br />Even more shocking is the awareness that many of the North Korean people have as to their flawed society.  One character recalls his father teaching him about the dual reality of their lives.  He says,<br /><br />\\"He told me that there was a path set out for us.  On it we had to do everything the signs commanded and heed all the announcements along the way.  Even if we walked this path side by side, he said, we must act alone on the outside, while on the inside, we would be holding hands.\\"<br /><br />Can you imagine living in a world where only one book is published per month and it's possible to brag that you've \\"seen Titanic\\" and \\"been on the internet ten different times?\\"<br /><br />In addition to the harsh portrayal of the realities of this world, the book is also full of violence when it comes to the treatment of certain citizens.  The second half of the book deals with torture and interrogation, the methods of which are crude and were painful to read at times.  Still, it's a fascinating look into a place that really exists but is easy to forget about because it's so hidden./>In addition to the harsh portrayal of the realities of this world, the book is also full of violence when it comes to the treatment of certain citizens.

B004XJRQUQ|1.0|I bought the trilogy on a recommendation from a friend - after reading the 1st book I was disappointed with the lack of creativity, and 80% through the 2nd, I had to stop, finally realizing these books are for teenage girls - it is poor science fiction - young people need to read Bradbury - Asimov - Clark -  Heinlein - and so on....
0099579936|1.0|How does this make the NY Times best sellers list? I've lost all hope! If you like taking your money and throwing it in the garbage then this books for you!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Handy little 'book', esp for scouts. Not impressed with the permissions/ spyware etc. As for phone access....i  can see where this could be necessary.  If a call comes in while the app is running, it may interfere with the app or it may provide easier access to answer. In<br />and of itself, it may not have some deeper, nefarious purpose.<br /><br />*** UPDATE... The weekend after downloading this app, my little boy's Boy Scout troop met for the purpose of... You guessed it ... Learning knots. This app was INVALUABLE for both of us. The one knot that was missing...I emailed the Dev,  and received a response the same day.... And he had just been working on it. The knots we worked on are now 'saved' for at home practice, as well!
1451673442|5.0|Want to change your life for the better?  Read this book and follow the suggestions she makes.  I've read it and loaned it to a friend that asked if she can keep it for the 28 days it takes to do all the suggestions.  Great read and a book to refer back to.

0553582038|4.0|I went into this book highly aware of its much lower ratings compared to its three predecessors. Before starting I also anticipated to give the book a lower rating, based also on the fact that two of my favorite characters, Daenerys and Tyrion would not be making appearances. Now, after finishing it, I'm quite conflicted.<br /><br />Through 90% of the book I was very bored, fell asleep regularly and even had to reread a few parts a second time. However, the last 150 pages or so really picked up pace and there came the jaw dropping moments that was so common in the first three books. Originally I was going to give it three stars, but the ending was enough to bring it up one. With this said, if you wish to read this, expect boredom as Martin presents characters duller than normal, countless plots that don't come to anything and just more blah, blah, blah fillers.<br /><br />Also, I don't know what you really get out of the characters that didn't have their perspective told before, like the ones from the Iron Islands, and the princess from Dorne. Must have been just the blah blah fillers I mentioned.<br /><br />please Please PLEASE let the next one be better. This series is just too good to go down the toilet at this stage in the game.
B008DB3N5W|1.0|...That's the best way to describe this new album, like one of the other reviewers said, this sounds like a spoof, like someone is trying to mock Manowar by taking all the things they been made fun of for in the past and exaggerating them X 10,...ultra simplistic riffs, ultra cheesy lyrics, egomaniacal bass mix, and production that sounds worse than their debut 30 yrs ago, using 30 yr old technology. There actually WAS a Manowar spoof band that came out a few years ago called \\"Nanowar\\" and if you disregard the purposefully ridiculous lyrics ( that aren't that far from Manowar's real lyrics)the actual song compositions are STILL stronger than what we are given here.<br />My first reaction to hearing this was a big WTF ? after the literal headache I got trying to listen to these songs over the \\"blown speaker/african killer bee\\" bass droning, the second emotion you get is embarrassment, you know the kind of embarrassment you would feel if you were watching as the wind blew the toupee off a 60 yr old man as he was trying to pick up a girl half his age,...yep that kind of embarrassment.<br />In one of the greatest examples of art imitating life, you have Joey's obnoxiously buzzing distorted bass mixed so high as to almost drown out all other members of the band, almost as a metaphor for his ego drowning out all input from any other bandmember. Even the great Eric Adams just \\"phones it in\\" on this one, why this man never branched out from manowar while his voice was still prime is beyone me, he could have done Broadway, Opera, you name it, all while keeping his Manowar gig and perhaps winning the band some crossover fans, nope instead his talents are wasted on an album that is so puerile, so juvenile and so derivitive  that if it wasn't backed by the \\"Manowar brand\\" with a 30 yr pedigree and strong back catalog, it would literally be laughed off the stage. As far as Karl and Donnie go,Donnie may have the nostalgia of being the first drummer but the drumming is so sterileand generic that I have literally heard drum machines with more charisma, and Karl sounds like he was just punching a timeclock on this one, they may both be nice guys but I think some pink slips are in order after this album, it's time to shake things up and bring in some new talent and actually LISTEN to their input.<br />Even the cover art is cheesy and simplistic and for once I actually do NOT want the great Ken Kelly to waste his incredible talents to put lipstick on this pig, the material is not worthy of him.<br />I really hope Manowar actually read these reviews, my advice to them : GROW UP!, your fans have,especially those of us that actually PAY for CDs, DO NOT wait 5 more yrs to rectify this mar on your reputation, branch out lyrically and musically, go back to HIGH QUALITY balanced production values and crisp sound, ditch ALL the cheese from your lyrics, and come up with some more complex, mature and interesting song structures that still have \\"hooky\\" choruses. Let's hope they listen, I have hard earned cash and a 5 star review waiting if they can deliver.
B0018LX9T4|3.0|This is the story of a girl who enjoys pain. In fact she gives it to herself. It is her way of dealing with her dysfunctional family. He is a lawyer who seems to rarely have any business. He is a man who hates what he does to women. He is struggling with what he likes to do to women. While she is accepting of herself and him.<br /><br />I really was a little disappointed.

B00701L5XS|5.0|This app is great for clearly displaying the types of knots my sons need to proceed through Scouting levels. The colors are well presented in order to clearly see which ends of the ropes are to be turned and used. The 3-d effect seems a bit of overkill for rope, but it is clear and helpful. It works well on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />However, I admit I can't give it 5 stars because of the permissions. I read the developer's statement that it is a package in the program, but I think the dev can work to fix this. I have other apps that do not have additional permissions to open network sockets. Hopefully, a future update will remove these extra permissions. Until then, it gets 3 stars - great program formaking knots, poor execution.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** The developer has removed the permissions so I have changed the stars to 5! It is nice to see a developer realizes users don't want data mining.
B00701L5XS|1.0|Animated Knots by Grog, unfortunately I don't think you can get it here at Amazon.  I uninstalled this app due to the spyware.
B0081X40HW|5.0|I watched her season and she was definitely one of my favorites. Ufortunately, most idols get a bad rap and end up wasting their time. This album however, is amazing! Her vocals are so retro and fun and really showcase her personality. She truly maintains the same character she was on American idol. This is a record to be proud of, it's dynamic in quality, fun to listen to. Her vocals are simaler to Adele and Sarah barreleis in my opinion. Please support young talent and buy this album, it's a steal at $5!
0143119680|5.0|This is when I need a six-star rating option - Discovery of Witches is fabulous!<br /><br />It's also one of those books I wanted to read non-stop, yet didn't want to finish. I feel like I've just finished drinking an ancient and very rich wine (one of Matthew's rare vintages, perhaps?)<br /><br />Matthew and Diana are characters who will tiptoe through my head for days and weeks to come; their skills and their magic are a delight.<br /><br />For me, Discovery of Witches ticked all the right boxes (and more), and I am looking forward to reading Shadow of Night.<br /><br />(It's also a book I wish I had written!)

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thanks Hugh! I got to a point (in book 5) where I felt, 'What more can happen, I can't take this!' Five minutes later, I had to pick it up and find out what happens.<br /><br />I think it was right on the edge between too dire and too hopeful, where a truly captivating story can happen. Wool was sci-fi interesting, without getting too technical. The back-stories were woven so that you engaged with the characters early but still wanted to get to know them better. Even the dead characters continued to be expanded, so that you cared more for them at the same time as the main characters came to appreciate them more.

Take an inexperienced female, make her \\"understand\\" that punishment is okay then take the same female and have her train the over-protective domineering male how to actually understand himself.  If life was only that simple.  Nice fantasy but reality is not as simple.  Enjoy the book.

B004ZN9R6G|5.0|Obscured by Clouds is, at least for me, up there with Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall. It's much different from these albums. It has a slow, country feel to it. Burning Bridges, Free Four, and Wots... Uh The Deal highlight this album with the first Floyd opus to show a more melancholy side.
B0049S1GK2|5.0|Countless people have already discussed the story of the film itself. This review is strictly for the quality of the Blu-ray Edition.<br /><br />I ordered this directly from Amazon.it {Italy}, and I must mention that it has been an extremely long time since I have been emotionally moved in such an immense manner, all thanks to this 01Distribution Rai Cinema Italian company. While all the other companies completely forgot about this film, I am incredibly grateful that they were willing to go through the extreme effort and expense in releasing this film in such a super high quality format. This is not a cheap, quickly-done Blu-ray attempt. The bit-rates are sometimes as high as 45+MBPS!!<br /><br />I watched this on the 55\\" LW5700 LG 3D Cinema screen connected to the Oppo BDP-93 Blu-ray player and the Denon AVR-3300CI receiver in true 5.1 channel surround sound, and the experience was absolutely nothing short of breathtaking! I watched it in 3D, and the picture quality is so immaculate and flawless, that I was finally able to see details and depth in this film that I NEVER imagined possible. This Blu-ray Edition also includes the original trailer in its' untouched VHS quality-level, and it is truly astonishing to witness the difference side-by-side! The sound quality is stunningly gorgeous!! And I could also hear details that I never heard before! This is what I have been waiting for, for an extremely long time, and I commend the Rai Cinema company for doing such an immaculate job on this new release!
B003XU02QG|5.0|Look, it's a movie, not a history lesson. If you're looking for a good action flick that happens to be set in Roman Britain, this is your movie. If you're a PhD in Roman British History and looking for validation of you're favorite theory of Pick military tactics, this isn't the film for you.<br /><br />Watch, enjoy. Try not to think too much looking for what wasn't ever put there...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game! if you like the old Mario on nintindo then you will love this game. its cute and highly addicting!
B00628RVV0|5.0|Beautifully made movie, making people aware of what happened during the Holocaust!  Sad, but very factual involving innocent children! Highly recommend you watch it!

0755374037|2.0|A \\"Discovery of Witches\\" in an interesting tale of a world populated by witches, vampires and deamons oh and humans.  Its story, in general, and its love story, in particular, are interesting and draws the reader in.  However, the book is about a third to a half to long.  Harkness loses the reader as she constantly detours into long digressions away from the main plot (rowing on the lake, eating meals, taking baths, relationships with tangential people, details on yoga class, inner angst....)  I found myself flipping through pages looking for the story to start up again. Where were her editors?? She also does this strange thing with her protagonist.  In the beginning of the book, Harkness paints a picture of a strong, intelligent self-reliant woman, someone we can admire.  By the middle of the book, her heroine has fainted, swooned, collapsed and otherwise been rescued by her vampire love to the point we can no longer believe she is strong.  By this point, she is just a neurotic mess. How can we possibly believe that this woman has made it this far on her life without her man to save her?? I am intrigued at how this story will end but I'm not sure if I would read the sequels unless there is major editing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great story! Easy to read. Fun to read. Adds more to the movie. Looking forward to reading the next books!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fairly addictive and fun,  this game keeps me entertained for hours without giving me that guilty feeling that I'm doing something mindless with my time. The only reason. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is that the graphics are very basic... which is really not that big of a deal to me,  but may be to some.
0439813786|1.0|The book took me two hours to read and is a terrible book. It just changes subjects. Don't buy it.
0061801313|4.0|I picked up this set because a number of my friends have been raving about the TV series, and I hadn't watched the first season. I'm currently working on the second set, so clearly I'm enjoying the series so far. As a disclaimer, my pros/cons are coming from the perspective of a woman in her early 30s who is an avid reader. I will read almost any genre, and think the key to enjoying any book is having realistic expectations. For example, I know that this series targets a junior high (and up) audience, so I didn't expect it to change my life. I didn't anticipate a particularly rich vocabulary, nor a great deal of character depth. I did expect an entertaining journey full of unexpected twists and turns, and that's what I got.<br /><br />Cons: The author uses \\"suddenly\\" and \\"all of a sudden\\" way too often. The writing style seems lazy at times, and there's a lot of name dropping. Pros: The story line is engaging, and differs from the TV series. I actually enjoy both, even though they are very loosely connected to one another.<br /><br />Overall, I've enjoyed this series and would recommend it. For parents, my suggestion is that you understand the topics these books cover (intimacy, hetrosexuality, underage drinking, peer pressure, theft, eating disorders, etc.) before giving them to your children. Personally, I wouldn't have an issue letting my teen read this series. It covers some controversial topics, but your children are exposed to these same topics on a daily basis in school and on tv. (Plus, many of these activities do have consequences...) It's no \\"worse\\" than anything I read as a teen, and my love of reading has stayed with me throughout life. :)
0985114606|1.0|Do not read this book if you read the Fifty Shades trilogy. The entire plot might not be exactly the same, but at the same time it's IS exactly the same. Even words/sayings used in this book are copied right from Fifty Shades, for example: 'what are you doing to me, Eva/Ana.' If you would have to choose between Fifty and Bared, choose Fifty. There is a lot of critique on the vocabulary EL James used, but it gives you the feeling that 'it's real'. It could be something you would say, without those heavy words used in Bared.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Fifty Shades and therefore hate Bared. It's an exact copy of the original story. Not buying the follow ups.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I like to remove the game from the device to wipe the scores out and reload it so I can challenge myself to go faster. Fun!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I was certainly not a novice to the music of George Harrison, but there are several songs on this album I've simply never heard before. And the ones I have heard before sound amazingly new. The sound is fantastic...the songs from \\"Cloud 9\\" sound better than they do on my 25-year-old CD. And the songs I've mostly just heard on the radio, like \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" simply sparkle. I appreciate George Harrison's talent even more than I did before, due to this collection and the way it's been remastered.<br /><br />The only negative quality of the album is that it makes one miss George and feel his loss all over again, even after all these years.
0307341577|5.0|What can I say about my new favorite author??? That I would read something she wrote on a napkin - because I would - I just finished Sharp Objects, excellent and now this?? I can only say that Libby is a young girl whose family has been murdered and its a mystery - her brother is in jail for the murder but did he do it?? The suspense and the dread with which Ms. Flynn writes is nail biting. I am hooked - I don't want to give away too much but if you're into sick and twisted the way I am? WELL DO NOT HESITATE - I couldn't put either book down and Gone Girl is next - the only reason I am waiting a bit is because that's the only three novels she has written and I want to savor every single word...YOU MS. FLYNN are truly an amazing author with words, visions and reality as I've always known it - I grew up in the city but my world has always been sick and twisted ;) and the way she writes the vision she gives of farm life and the country I feel as if I've always lived in that world! I haven't been able to sleep for three nights because I can't put this book down.  It is THAT good. YOU GO GIRL!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|All the rave reviews MUST be left by people who a) have never read a book before, or b) don't have access to the internet.  I'm not sure what it says about our reading public that a book THIS poorly written and THIS boring is a best seller.  I mean, seriously...go to Google and type in \\"erotic literature\\".  I guarantee that better erotic literature is on any one of those sites than what's in this book.  What's worse is that I have really smart friends who LOVE this book...I just don't understand it!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has great games and a good deal and it is awesome I love it I will keep on playing it forever
140053271X|5.0|I love this ereader. I used kindles sony readers - this one's got very fast and responsive screen, the brightest eink screen i've seen so far. The limitations though are terrible.

It's just Awesome!<br />The only pro i see is that it does not fit in your pocket :(

1250000971|2.0|After reading the first book of the trilogy, I was looking forward to the second one. What a disappointment.  I like Archer as a story teller. He tells interesting and plausible stories in a fast pace with good always overcoming evil. I don't think his style makes a good trilogy. This second novel follows the same style as the first with mostly the same characters. Each chapter focuses on one of the main characters. Something bad happens , quickly followed by something good , which corrected the bad thing. But the story becomes  less interesting , less probable and repetitive. It ends with the usual cliff hanger but I was so bored at the end I could care less what happens next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really cool! I really like playing and unlocking levels! you should get it now! totally worth: Free
0061692042|3.0|This is a story about a fifteen year old boy who encounters hardship beyond anything most of us will ever experience.<br />It is beautifully written, with detailed descriptions  of people, environments and events. Much of the writing is devoted to Dell's [the main character]  thoughts and reactions to the hardship he experiences and to the character flaws of his parents,sister and other people he encounters.Unfortunately, very little action actually occurs. For example, the bank robbery which is mentioned at the beginning of the story , finally occurs half way through the story.  The first half of the novel focuses on Dell's view of his parents and sister, little of which is positive or uplifting. The second half of the story focuses on Dell's life in Canada. Most of the writing again is focused on the character flaws of the people he encounters. The murders mentioned at the beginning finally take place almost at the  end. The writing, as beautiful as it is , eventually became repetitive and tedious.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|cant put it down keeps me entertained for hours. sometimes its a little to addicting. lots of challenge<br />don't like sound affects to much
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Taken as a whole this is a great love story.  You can see Grey's mental health change and imporove through his relationship with Ana.  You can watch their love develop into a truly great love.
0345803485|3.0|I have to agree with many of the negative reviews about these books.  I am giving it three stars because for as repetitive as they are with the many undeveloped characters and complete unrealistic nature of the content, I think they are a fun read.  You don't pick these up because you want to do some serious contemplating about anything other than whether you are the kind of person that would or would not like to be in a S&M relationship.  These books are just a guilty pleasure of the restless housewife, bored single woman or college girl who still believes things like this could happen.  If you are an avid ready, you will most likely hate these for all the reasons stated, but if you are someone who just wants to delve into something mindless and light without burden, these will provide that.  I would not recommend having your teenage daughter read them unless A. She already knows everything there is to know about sex, B. You are able to have an open conversation about why this is not \\"normal\\" or C. you really want her to have an unrealistic and rather raunchy outlook on sex.

B007X4ECMI|5.0|I'll keep this short. I rather enjoyed this movie. The whole time watching it, I kept thinking,\\" this is just like a Die Hard movie, only with Pearce playing the roll of Bruce Willis.\\" The only thing I wasn't happy with was Maggie Grace's character, but I got over it pretty quick. This movie was alot of fun, and never boring. Pop the popcorn and grab a drink and enjoy.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This would be a 5 star if it weren't for the ads that you have to skip through to get to each round. Otherwise, I love this game!

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a very well written book about two rancid people, both<br />of whom are total phonies. It is a testament to the author's skill<br />that she has made such lowlifes interesting.

B0000931QA|5.0|Hard to believe this album was written by young 20 year olds...This music stands the test of time and unequaled by anything produced today. This remastered copy even improves on the orginal, which was ahead of it's time and didn't need to be remastered to begin with. No big changes, which is good, and this remaster is even cleaner. Well worth it.
0061673730|2.0|This book makes be feel like an idiot.  I bought it about a year ago and read it about a year ago (just now getting to do reviews) because I'm a gear head and also because this book is supposed to be so monumental.  I have no idea what the others are getting out of it.  I'm giving it two stars because the author at least knew a little about motorcycles.  I do understand that the motorcycle maintenance is just a metaphor for quality and striving to be better.  But at least the motorcycle parts are somewhat accurate.<br /><br />I think you have to be a certain type to like this, into the whole zen thing.  If your not, then this won't win you.  It is unbelieveably boring.  Beginning, middle and end.  If it were a new book, I would have put it down after 30 pages.  But I read it because I THOUGHT is was SUPPOSED to be so important and enlightening.  The ending, if that's the right word, was a huge let down.  Nothing happens in this book.  May that's zen.  Nothing witty, nothing enlightening, nothing important, and no conclusions made.<br /><br />Please don't blast me for a negative review.  I respect others liking it.  But I would not recommend this to fellow intelligent gear heads who find beauty in building and maintaining things.

0345803485|5.0|I have heard about this book for several weeks now.  Everyone talking about \\"Christian Grey\\" and how great the book was in many different ways.  I meant to get it on my Kindle Fire, but I accidentally  bought the paperback version.  None the less, the book is very interesting and I can't wait to ready the second one.
B0000793ZA|4.0|Sparkle in the Rain is Simple Minds' sixth studio album. It peaked at number one in the UK album charts on 18 February 1984, a mere 12 days after its release. Simple Minds charted on U.S. charts with 14 songs between 1981 and 1995, hitting #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles and the U.S. Top Rock Tracks charts in 1985 with \\"(Don't You) Forget About Me\\", a worldwide number-one hit. While only reaching number seven in the UK, it stayed on the charts from 1985-1987, one of the longest time spans for any single in the history of the chart. Prior to this breakthrough smash hit (which was first passed on by The Fixx, Bryan Ferry and Billy Idol) Simple Minds' six year career, with as many albums, was known in U.S. only to the post punk/new wave/college alternative underground.<br /><br />A year prior to \\"(Don't You) Forget About Me\\", A+M released Sparkle in the Rain, the Minds' sophomore U.S. album. The Steve Lillywhite produced album reached #64 on the Billboard album chart. Its three singles, \\"Waterfront\\", \\"Speed Your Love To Me\\" and \\"Up on the Catwalk\\", all charted in the top 20 in Britain or Europe, with \\"Waterfront\\" hitting #1 in several countries, becoming a signature song for the band. Like all Simple Minds singles until \\"Forget About Me\\", none of Sparkles' singles touched the U.S. Billboard chart.<br /><br />Although critical consensus is that their previous album, 1982's [[ASIN:B0000793Z9 New Gold Dream]], is Simple Minds' artistic peak, Sparkle in the Rain is a fan fav in the UK and europe, where the album and its singles sold and charted considerably better than the New Gold Dream releases. No one can resist Steve Lillywhite`s production of Mel Gaynor`s thunderous drums, and the album`s 12\\" remixes, particularly \\"Speed Your Love To Me\\", are often cited as zeniths for both the Minds and Lillywhite.<br /><br />Uber enjoyable, and with a credible Lou Reed cover to boot!  The only reason I can`t give it a 5th star (like New Gold Dream) is because plenty of the lyrics are awkward and cringe inducing.  But that`s Jim Kerr in 1984!
B008645YEE|5.0|This is a fantastic soundtrack. All the songs are full of emotion and filled energy. I can't wait to see how the score is used in the film. Hans Zimmer has once again proven he's the best in the business. I highly recommend purchasing this album.

It was interesting following the relationship from the perspective of both characters in the novel.<br />This is defenitley not a predictable read, which makes the book that much more enjoyable.<br />Can't wait to read more Gillian Flynn books.

B006OCM0G0|3.0|This is a good game, I love to design my restaurant and have neighbors. They can send you food or objects to help you build things for your restaurant, like juice machines, or special cooking devices. That part is a bit frustrating though. You buy a juice machine, with coins that are earned, then have to spend gems to build the darn thing! I had to get neighbors just so they can send me the materials!<br />I do discourage a lot of it though. I bought several gems to expand my restaurant, and they have a habit of disappearing!! Be ware of that happening. Teamlava is no help and will not make it right. I have noticed that others can see your restaurant, which is nice because they can leave tips, but once in awhile, they don't leave and can spend your hard earned, paid with cash, gems!!!<br />I love to play, but am considering deleting because I cannot afford to buy gems and have the game eat them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put it down one of a kind book had to read them all!  Complex and intriguing characters you have to love
B0034G4OZO|5.0|This is was a small market movie (saw it in the theater; have not yet listend to the blu-ray so this is not a completely fair review of the actual product; though I did purchase it). Think garden state (though the story is very different). 100% recommended heart warming story.
0385341008|5.0|On the recommendation of a friend, I read this book.  I've never read a book with this format, all letters.  It was a very interesting story about the lives of the Guernsey people during the Nazi Occupation and shortly after.  Even though it is a work of fiction you become concerned about these people. I can't wait to visit Guernsey.
B006NXICT4|5.0|I really enjoyed this Trilogy, the bittersweet story, was easy to read and continued to hold me from the beginning, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, and ending with this final book,[[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]].<br /><br />I approached this whole Trilogy with apprehension, after hearing alot of reviews dismissing it as merely a story of  \\"Children killing each other.\\" But it proved to have depth and passion, joyous rapture, and painful heartache.<br /><br />I loved it.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I'll give you my review of this product first, than my gaming background and finally my favorite PS3 and PC audio setup.<br /><br />Turtle Beach PX21<br /><br />  I like the rich features and simple setup of the px21. Just plug in the usb to the ps3/pc and plug the 3.5mm plug into the RCA adapter from the ps3. The bass, chat and game volume controller is very helpful. Some games you may want less bass or maybe you can't hear one of your friends. Or most likely your stalking someone in COD and you dont want to hear your friends chatting about what some girl tweeted. The mic mute button is also great for incoming calls and people that stop over for a chat. The usb and 3.5mm plug is a nice feature. I can plub the usb into the ps3 and chat with friends on the ps3 and listen to music on my ipod at the same time(using the tv speakers for the game) I can also use the usb to plug into a pc and use ventrilo or teamspeak for chat while gaming on the ps3 using the 3.5mm for game volume. Basically the usb is its own sounds processor with sound in and mic out. The 3.5mm is the tradition mp3 player headphone connetor for sound in. The px21 has a built in audio mixer. So it basically mixes the 3.5mm & usb audio into one. I didn't find the expander helpful and I rarely used it. The microphone is good semi directional and minimal background noise.<br /><br />Sound quality is average. The lows are good, the mids are average and the bass is better than average.  The headset is a closed style but I would say only blocks 8 dbs of outside noise. The px21 also has background noise due to electrical noise over the usb and if you drop it a few times you will also get a hiss besides the usb.<br /><br />Build quality is a little cheap.  The plastic seems cheap and the microphone swivel seems loose. The ear cushions is soft but not thick enough for some ears. The head adjustment feels a little stretched. A quick head turn may cause the headset to fall off.  The cord cable and control box is aok construction. No problems with wires being exposed. I have dropped these several times without any issues. I have an oval shaped head that is larger than average and I could wear these without any discomfort for about 2 hours. After that It started to bother my ears.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />Good Bass<br />Good mix Controls: game/chat/bass/mic controls<br />Not allot of cord clutter.<br />Fairly comfortable.<br />USB & 3.5mm Sound In inputs<br />Good Mic and I like how you can hear what your saying.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cheap build quality.<br />Mild background hiss.<br />Average audio quality.<br />USB powered.<br />--------------------<br />OVERALL<br /><br />If your going to buy the PX21's than make sure you look into getting the Turtle beach DDS 7.1 sound processor.

DDS2 is 4.1 and has a worse processor chip) DDS will allow you to get virtual 5.1/7.1 surround sound through any speaker/headphone/earbud with a 3.5mm plug. It has optical spdif in and also 3.5mm in. Its powered by usb to mini usb cable(same as ps3 controller)and has a pass through for any other usb device. You may get background noise because of harddrive and other elctrical noise, but it is minimal and depends on the dds and ps3 you have. To bypass this you could buy a external battery for a cellphone that has a usb out. This would power the dds without any electrical interference.<br /><br />With the SteelSeries Cross plateform AudioMixer you have separate volume control for game and chat and also a fade function for chat. It will automatically lower the game volume for chat when someone talks. I turn it off though. Mic mute option.<br /><br />Low BASS Option: The AD700 headphone is my favorite headphone.

HT Omega uses the C-Media Oxygen HD CMI8788 Audio Processor. Both are good, but the asus has an standalone power connection and an electrical noise filtering system. If you buy the asus, make sure you throw the driver disc away and download the latest drivers and install it. Both have Dolby Headphones , virtual 7.1 and PL IIx. Both are good options.

B00498XRPE|5.0|I wanted to watch Alien again prior to seeing Prometheus in the theatre.  My fifteen-year-old daughter, who had never seen Alien before, watched with me.  I was amazed at just how well this movie has aged--in the sense that it is just as scary and wonderful as when I saw it way-back-when.  Alien is timeless; aside from the green-screen monitors, you would never know that this was filmed over 30 years ago.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|\\"A Dance with Dragons\\" was an excellent 5th book to the series.  I'm anxious for the next one to come out.<br /><br />The only constructive criticism I would offer to the author involves his story development of secondary characters.  Please refrain from using their vantage point quite so often.  It made sense at times; but other times, it seemed as it was being used as a \\"filler.\\"<br /><br />The main characters were delicious, and George wrote them beautifully.<br /><br />Thanks for such great entertainment, Ser Martin!<br /><br />- Editing my original response from 5 to 3 stars.  As mentioned in my subsequent postings to responses to this review, I thought of the series as a whole instead of just this book.  Thanks to others for helping me analyze this book on its own merits.  I was so anxious to hear about my beloved characters that I over-romanticized the fact that this book was not nearly as good as the first 3.
0812993292|4.0|This was an interesting story, and it kept me interested from the first chapter to the last. I enjoyed the characters (flaws and all) and rooted for Harold through the whole book. I also loved the end of the story (without giving away too much, I thought it worked perfectly). However, if you picked this up expecting [[ASIN:0812981227 Major Pettigrew's Last Stand: A Novel]] then you might be disappointed. This book is not quite as charming nor does it have as much staying power (you know a book is good when a year later you can still remember the entire plot). However, it is an enjoyable book that most novel readers will enjoy.

0307944689|4.0|this was a good book to get strategies on how to answer during the exam. my score improved from 86 to 110. the reading practice tests were easier than the actual test though. listening, writing, and speaking practice tests were very helpful. i liked the cracking section since i learned techniques on how to answer fast, but surely. i only have 1.5 hour to read 4 passages with minimum of 5 paragraphs plus answer 56 questions on the reading. the techniques the book taught me helped me a lot on how to be able to maximize my time. i liked how you only read parts from the paragraphs then go to the questions immediately so you will not run out of time. also, the tips it gave to answer the summary question, which are worth 2 points, were also very helpful since i found that confusing. i liked the practice tests for the listening part since they are similar to the actual test. the audio CD that comes with it will be very helpful on this part (and also with the speaking section). in the writing, i only focused on the techniques they give on how you will develop the paragraphs. then most importantly the speaking section... i focused on this more since it was my lowest on my first attempt on toefl. the only thing is that you have to time yourself, which i did.<br /><br />PS (i also used the barron's practice tests (the program, not the book) for the speaking, which i find more helpful since it tries to give you a feel of the actual test and it does the timing for you. i also recommend using the speaking and writing strategies by bruce stirling. the technique it gave helped me score 28/30 for both writing and speaking.)
0553386794|5.0|I enjoy reading fantasy novels as a guilty pleasure, but I also find them badly written and adolescent.  But \\"Game of Thrones\\" is not only a wonderful read, but it's incisively and precisely written.  George Martin is masterful at creating a multi-layered and suspenseful plot, and weaving a rich tapestry of characters and emotions.<br /><br />\\"Game of Thrones\\" focuses on court intrigue, and throughout suggests dark sinister forces lurking in the background, about to pounce.  What it does well is effortlessly change from perspective to perspective while maintaining a coherent flow to the epic.<br /><br />The only flaw I can find in this book is the Ned character, who is far too proud and self-righteous for his own good.
0385344228|4.0|Andy Barber has been an assistant District Attorney for more than 20 years.  He is happily married to Laurie, with a teenage son, Jacob.  When a local schoolboy - a classmate of Jacob's - is murdered, Andy starts to investigate.  Early evidence points to a local pedophile.  Then - to Andy's shock - his son Jacob is charged with the crime.  Andy is suspended from his job and joins the defence team to clear his son's name.<br /><br />The first half of this book unfolds at a steady but not terribly compelling pace, but things pick up as the case goes to trial.  Andy narrates the story and is utterly convinced of his son's innocence, even when the evidence raises doubts in the mind of the reader.  One of the strong points of the book is the way that you're kept guessing as to whether Jacob is innocent or guilty until the very end.  At times I was convinced that he was, then at others I'd decide he couldn't be.  An interesting twist is that Andy's father was himself a murderer - a fact that he has kept hidden from his family until now.<br /><br />Andy and Laurie react quite differently to the accusations against Jacob.  At times this book reminded me of [[ASIN:0062119044 We Need to Talk About Kevin tie-in: A Novel (P.S.)]], not in terms of the plot specifics, but in the way that the father blindly thinks the best of his son at all times, while the mother is more aware of his flaws.  I found Andy's personality somewhat too simplistic in this regard.  Some of the things he does and the thoughts that he has just seem unrealistic for an Assistant DA.  I also felt that the book would have been stronger if we'd been given some more insight into Jacob's personality - we get told what others think of him, but he never really became a real person for me.<br /><br />A highly readable story which raises lots of thought provoking questions and comes together in a terrific way at the end.

B007PM218K|4.0|This is a review of the new BD of the classic film \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\".<br /><br />First off, when reading reviews of this title be aware that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL versions of a film, whether DVD, Blu-ray (and even VHS). So if you are looking for a review of the Bluray, sort reviews by date (with most current first). That should help guide you.<br /><br />With that said, this is a review of the single-disc BD released on June 5, 2012.<br /><br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" (TGOW) is a classic film and one that everyone should see. It's re-release by Fox is timely as much of the US is still in a recession and unemployment is high. There are many folks re-locating from their homes (if they haven't been evicted already) looking for work. If you want to know more about the film and its plot, there are over 160 reviews here that will provide that info. So I'll concentrate on the BD release, it's special features and not on the film itself.<br /><br />TGOW was filmed in black and white in a standard format of 1.33:1 so no matter what screen aspect your TV has the image will be virtually square. Even on an older non-flat screen TV the image does not fill the screen but has thick black border on all sides. Direct John  Ford used dark images (and lots of great shadows) to tell the story and , though the BD image is brighter than previous releases, it show the graininess of the film. I also noted in the early scenes that the brightness would waiver, but I got used to it as I concentrated on the story.<br /><br />The BD has, as special features, a commentary track (same as on previous DVD release) that I did not listen to, a series of short Fox Movietone newsreels about the dust bowl and the Academy Award presentation to actress Jane Darwell (who won the award for Best Actress but is not even given recognition by name on the package despite a fabulous performance) totally about 8-minutes. There is also a 25-minute piece from the Fox Legacy TV show (on Fox of course) with Tom Rothman. I tried to get into it but Rothman is - frankly - not a good speaker and I found a bit too pompous for my tastes. Despite playing with the Display Aspect control on my BD player, I found that the excerpts from the film that were included in Rothman's piece, were out of \\"ratio\\" and the image was \\"squished\\". I'm not sure how this plays on other TVs. The BD also gives you the option of watching the film with the \\"forward\\" included in the British release, which the producers decided was necessary to explain the economic conditions in the US to the British theater audience. A nice touch for completeness. The last bonus is an A&E episode on Producer Daryl F. Zanuck (that I haven't gotten to yet.).<br /><br />Having read a few other reviews of the DVD version here, it appears that the DVD version has a sharper image than the BD, despite a few more dark spots. I can't tell if the images in the bonuses are any different as I only have the BD.<br /><br />So, while I generally would turn to a BD version over the DVD version, I think in this case there is more reason to get the DVD than the BD. But, if you haven't seen this film before, with great acting by Henry Fonda and Darwell, then get it in either version. Just get it.<br /><br />My rating is a bit skewed. The film gets five stars (I love it), the bonuses three stars (it's OK) and  formatting between 3 and 4 stars.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"Fox of course) with Tom Rothman.

B007KUFDBY|5.0|It is my personal opinion that this is the single most underrated Disney film ever made. It deserves way more attention than it gets. It's an amazing adventure story that was translated seamlessly from classic to sci-fi. The animation is awesome, the use of CGI was spot on and the amount of character development in this story out-does most other Disney films. This is pure adventure and I wish Disney would make more like it. This movie is good for anyone at any age.

0345803485|1.0|Before I start, I have 3 points I'd like to make:<br /><br />1) This is my very first written book review. Normally I just share my enthusiasms and disappointments about the books that I read with my friends and my family. Why did I decide to write a review about this book? Because I cannot believe that this book is all over the media, CNN and the TODAY show are talking about it, some close friends of mine mentioned that they had read the book, and finally that there are rumors that there will be a movie made based on this book.<br /><br />2) This book is the first &quot;erotica&quot; novel that I have ever read in my life. That is not to say that I'm a prude. It is just that it never crossed my mind to read this particular genre. After reading this book I still accept and respect that this genre of literature can be fun, entertaining, and enjoyable, and I will definitely look up some of the authors and the books recommended of erotica literature by other disappointed reviewers of &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;.<br /><br />3) I had not imagined that my first ever review would be a negative review of a book. This is not deliberate. I just want to share my opinion about this book because I am truly dumb-founded how this book could ever have positive reviews and praises. Also, just as with &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; (another book that left me seriously wondering what is going on in the world and the mass culture) I honestly had more fun reading the 1-star and 2-star reviews than the book itself.<br /><br />All right, from the very first page I realized that this book was going to be another disappointing read (again, as compared with &quot;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&quot;) as far as grammar, word choice, editing, and general writing was concerned. &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; `s writing is bad. Really bad. It is not literature. It is street slang full of clich&eacute;s telling a story. Example, &quot;Oh, the Merc is a fun drive, and the miles slip away as I hit the pedal to the metal&quot;. The words &quot;crap&quot;, &quot;double crap&quot; and &quot;triple crap&quot; are used freely and often, and so are the words &quot;jeez&quot; and &quot;holy crap&quot;. Of course, plenty of other reviewers have rightly pointed out the repetitive and trailer trash language. Is this being harsh? Not really, because the average reader has been prompted to think that this book is worth reading because it is good. There are some of us who disagree.<br /><br />I already mentioned the trailer trash language. Now, imagine my surprise when, as I was reading, I found that in the same book that the lead character is only capable of exclaiming &quot;crap&quot; and &quot;double crap&quot; Chopin and Bach are mentioned. After my initial surprise I became angry. Chopin and Bach and other composers are so great that they don't belong in this lowest of books. I was offended on their behalf. As I read further I realized that E. L. James must have thought that she'd insert occasional &quot;culture&quot; into her story because that is what good books contain! At some point Anastasia (or her inner goddess?) imagines herself looking like Munch's &quot;The Scream&quot; (even though neither the artist nor the name of the work is named). Oh, and the famous &quot;Et tu, Brute&quot; is inserted in the most inappropriate of places. Now, as often happens with anyone who is angry, my anger has subsided and only amusement is left. Yes, I am amused. I am amused because now I realize that the &quot;culture&quot; that E. L. James was so desperate to portray in her book to show how sophisticated she is is actually the most common knowledge that even the most of uneducated adults know, simply because they have walked around outside and talked to people.<br /><br />Now, let us be forgiving about the lowly writing style, the use of trailer trash language and the insertion of &quot;culture&quot; in this book and let us focus on the story and the characters. The book was hyped after all because of the characters and the story line. But this is where the story really fails. First of all, let me just primarily concentrate on the central character, Anastasia Steele. From the very beginning of the story until the very end of the book it is clear that she is a person of below average intelligence (and she might have some physical problems as well that hinders her from walking straight). She constantly doubts her looks, her ability to attract the opposite sex, and her ability to converse normally with others. Yet in reality she is gorgeous and &quot;a total babe&quot; (as pointed out by her roommate). She just does not know it. If a woman is 22 years old and so beautiful that she can attract the most handsome 26-year-old billionaire in the world (and all the other young males mentioned in the story) yet she does not know that she is truly beautiful (fine, just pretty), then I state again that she has below average intelligence.<br /><br />As we delve further into the story we are introduced to her &quot;inner goddess&quot;. Her &quot;subconscious&quot; also makes a few appearances. (This is where you truly realize how clueless and uneducated E. L. James is, when she assumes that we are aware what our &quot;subconscious&quot; is &quot;thinking&quot;.) At some point we are subjected to three different thoughts, that of Anastasia, her inner goddess, and her subconscious. Seriously.<br /><br />This below-average-intelligence woman, Anastasia, apparently loves to read British literature and identify herself with strong role models. She ponders what would Elizabeth Benneth and others think if they were in her shoes. Yet she is a pushover in her own life. Her best friend constantly nags her and orders her around. Her long-time male friend who's always had a crush on her tries to take advantage of her while she is drunk outside of the bar, and yet they remain &quot;friends&quot;.  And of course, she lets herself be beaten brutally by her &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; despite being warned repeatedly that it would actually be brutal.<br /><br />Oh, and Christian, the &quot;Fifty Shades&quot;. I have actually nothing to say about him. He might be a fantasy that Anastasia made up while she is recovering in a hospital somewhere because she fell due to her clumsiness.<br /><br />And let us not forget the most important part of the book. The erotica. I have to admit, the first erotic scene was actually a bit exciting. But then it went downhill from there. There were some scenes that went on for many pages, yet I was truly bored reading those pages. Like I said in my second point above, I am sure there is great erotic literature that is worth reading. &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; is not one of them.<br />When I first decided to read &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; I purchased all three books of the trilogy. I never finished the first book. With that experience I decided to only get the first of the trilogy of &quot;Fifty Shades&quot;. I am glad I did. While I did finish the first book (I was truly interested to see how the author would end the book) I will not read the second and the third books of the trilogy. There were some great reviewers of the second book (I thank you!) that made me realize that this horrible style of writing in the first book carries over to the other books. I just would not be able to tolerate such writing any further.<br /><br />I realize that subpar books like &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; have always existed, will always exist, and a great majority of the masses will read and enjoy them. But I also believe that this book became so successful because the media advertised the book and hyped it up. And that is really sad and speaks volumes of what today's society represents.cters. The book was hyped after all because of the characters and the story line. But this is where the story really fails. First of all, let me just primarily concentrate on the central character, Anastasia Steele. From the very beginning of the story until the very end of the book it is clear that she is a person of below average intelligence (and she might have some physical problems as well that hinders her from walking straight).

Her long-time male friend who's always had a crush on her tries to take advantage of her while she is drunk outside of the bar, and yet they remain &quot;friends&quot;.  And of course, she lets herself be beaten brutally by her &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; despite being warned repeatedly that it would actually be brutal.<br /><br />Oh, and Christian, the &quot;Fifty Shades&quot;. I have actually nothing to say about him. He might be a fantasy that Anastasia made up while she is recovering in a hospital somewhere because she fell due to her clumsiness.<br /><br />And let us not forget the most important part of the book. The erotica. I have to admit, the first erotic scene was actually a bit exciting. But then it went downhill from there. There were some scenes that went on for many pages, yet I was truly bored reading those pages. Like I said in my second point above, I am sure there is great erotic literature that is worth reading. &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; is not one of them.<br />When I first decided to read &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; I purchased all three books of the trilogy. I never finished the first book. With that experience I decided to only get the first of the trilogy of &quot;Fifty Shades&quot;. I am glad I did. While I did finish the first book (I was truly interested to see how the author would end the book) I will not read the second and the third books of the trilogy. There were some great reviewers of the second book (I thank you!) that made me realize that this horrible style of writing in the first book carries over to the other books. I just would not be able to tolerate such writing any further.<br /><br />I realize that subpar books like &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; have always existed, will always exist, and a great majority of the masses will read and enjoy them. But I also believe that this book became so successful because the media advertised the book and hyped it up. And that is really sad and speaks volumes of what today's society represents.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|Honestly, I didn't hate the series.<br /><br />The overall 'romance story' was okay but the hype around the books is pretty misleading. I did find the writing to be a little weak and the 'steamy' bits not all that shocking (uumm..not sure what that says about me!?).<br /><br />I see many reviewers are quite passionate about their LOVE or HATE for the series but I think that has more to do with the PR than the story itself.<br /><br />Probably best to get the first book and take it from there? If you are a very sensitive about naughty story-lines it may not be for you but if you are a fan of erotica, best to skip this one.<br /><br />(To the author: it would have been 2 1/2 stars but you got an extra half for your good choice in cars)

B0030DBGXY|5.0|I have had this knife for almost a year now. Its the easily the best of the 5 Cold Steel knives I own, and the coolest one too. At first I was gonna get the AUS 8 srk but once I saw the san mai 3 one I couldnt resist the coolness of the blinding steel. The VG1 holds a good edge for a long time and is quite easy for a novice like me to sharpen. The only reason I didnt go for the cheaper AUS 8 one was because the paint on it gets all scratched up making it look shabby (the san mai 3 one doesn't have paint on it). The sheath it comes with is good and secure. The only bad part is that the knife locks in by the kraton getting pinched and over time the kraton slightly rubs away like a pencil eraser, but nothing is indestructible and the sheath slowly looses grip on the knife and it becomes a bit wobbly. The thick blade gives the knife some weight making it a good chopper for the size and it can still do  most tasks that a light weight knife can do. The kraton handle absorbs a lot of the shock from impact and is also very grippy. The one bad thing i noticed was that the tang can be shifted up and down in the handle about a mm when very cold (somewhere around 25 degrees), of course mine is probably the only one with this minor problem. Oh yeah, did I mention it's shiny? On a sunny day, fumbling around with this knife is kinda like staring at the sun (one disadvantage of not having the non reflective black paint). At around 100 bones this knife is a great deal.<br /><br />My cousin has the AUS 8 srk and its pretty good too, but he got his when it was $6o...not $80 like it is now.

030758836X|4.0|This book is a good mystery and quite a page-turner.  The book is basically a lot of twists and turns, as a psychotic wife tortures her husband by faking her own kidnapping.  Thing is, mystery aside, the author uses the persona of Amy, the psycho wife,  as a platform for a general critique of the male sex.  Amy dislikes (among other things) the way men worship youth and beauty in  women.  She dislikes this trait in Nick, her husband.  She also dislikes other traits Nick has. Amy does not like faults in her men.  She really doesn't.  And boy does makes them pay for 'em. Strongly recommended, if you don't mind the author's endless bitching about how terrible men are.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This novel allows the reader to feel complex levels of empathy and disgust with the characters. Libby, the main character and survivor of the murders of her family members, has personality problems that could make most readers dislike her: petty stealing, selling herself for money, flashing anger at small annoyances... She has admirable qualities: finding her own unorthodox ways to weather her trauma, her empathy for other lost characters, and  just the sheer weight of suffering that she endures. Ambivalence toward Libby makes her seem more real.<br /><br />Like [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]], this novel also keeps the reader engaged with masterful language and detail. Flynn is a fantastic writer -- leagues above most genre authors.<br /><br />Also like Gone Girl, her awareness of current social issues make the story fresh: In Dark Places, Flynn uses society's superficial condemnation of the economically injured -- classism -- as well as scapegoating through faddish social paranoia to increase the tension and isolation for the Day family.<br /><br />This book demands some understanding of extremely marginal characters, the emotionally wounded. If you want uplifting characters in \\"normal\\" society, this is not your book. If you love psychological thrillers that illuminate the human in the wounded, then you will love this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Who is John Carter?  That's what I said before I read the 1917 book A Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This movie holds very close to the original story. Of course we know now that there are no creatures on mars, but we also know that about the moon and yet we can still appreciate the 1964 movie First Men in the Moon by H.G. Wells.  Watch this movie after reading the book and you will probably enjoy it more.
B005EYP8PO|3.0|...I'm expecting a ton of bad comments for this but here goes...Achtung, Baby has four or five good songs on it but that's IT. Even Better Than the Real Thing and The Fly are good rock and roll songs. Love is Blindness is pretty cool in its deep blue bleakness. One is good except for its awful pretentious poetry(did you come to play Jesus to the lepers in your head) Most of the other songs have extremely weak melodies masked by over-production and sound fx. Zoo Station has almost no melody at all and except for two lines, a terrible lyric. Mysterious Ways has a weak lyric, melody and a riff Clapton could play with his toe. Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World is barely a song at all. So Cruel has no melody whatsoever and grows tiresome after a couple of minutes and some melodramatic cliches (you need her like a drug!!) Achtung, Baby may have been a big deal in an era of Garth Brooks, Poison and the birth of grunge, but in the late 60s and 70s next to albums like Who's Next, Layla, Exile on Main St, Electric Ladyland, Innervisions and Physical Graffitti, it would have been quickly forgotten.
0786956291|3.0|I decided to buy this box set because I haven't played in 25 years. I bought the box set and the Players handbook together. I am glad I did.<br /><br />This set takes you through step-by-step, but their explanations lack depth. They tell you to locate cards that they didn't include in the set, and they only include one of each card. Having only one card means that if more than one player share an ability or action, only one of them has the reference card. They include spells and abilities that are not part of the 4th edition. The character sheets are complicated, and they do not reflect the regular character sheets. The types of character and races you can choose between are limited, and it does not reflect the full range of races that the regular game includes.  They advance the monsters faster than your characters develop; leaving the characters without enough strength and ability to face the challenges, so all the characters will most likely end up dead.<br /><br />When referencing the Players Handbook we found it much more intuitive, and we couldn't have gotten through this box set without it. Otherwise we would would have been guessing at what to do on many occasions.<br /><br />On another note, the box set does allow you to dive right in without knowing anything. But don't expect to be able to jump into a game with experienced players based on what you learned from this box. You will have to relearn several things. For the price it is an OK introduction to the base concepts. Just don't expect it to be a complete learning tool. Be prepared to get confused and lost within the game.
B00701L5XS|5.0|some typos in the instructions, but overall a great app. I especially like the 3D aspect, as well as the brief knot history.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I'll admit to being a total novice when it comes to music recording and production. But for about $25, this mic has a great sound, and was a lot better than what I'd been using before. As other reviews have indicated, the mic DOES NOT COME WITH CABLES. This is no fault of the product itself, but be warned...you'll have to spend an additional $10 or more getting a proper cable. I ended up getting a USB cable that goes straight into my computer, which works ok.

B005IQZB14|4.0|I wasn't sure I would enjoy this book after reading Bill Bryce's book \\"A Walk In The Woods\\". ( a comically well written<br />Story of the author walking the Appalachian Trail.).

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Every now and then you read a book that draws you in and makes you feel like your right in the middle of it all, that is what this book was for me.  Even after finishing the story I couldn't put it down. I am a big fan of the Twilight series and this book was similarly written and pulled me in much the same way.  I loved it!

B002I9Z8B2|5.0|I loved the BlueRay version of this movie.<br />I read other reviews and didn't see that anyone really liked it.<br />I loved it. This is one of my favorite movies ever, and is a HUGE upgrade from the regular DVD version. When I first watched the DVD, I found the sound watt be crappy. Really crappy. Like a mono AM radio from the '70s crappy.<br />The Blue ray sound quality, which is the biggest reason I bought it, didn't disappoint. It was all I hoped it would be.<br /><br />Get it.

They line was well thought out and used one of my favorite writing devices where you see one story line that is told from multiple perspectives. Like in Fifth Element where Zorg and Lelu are telling the same story about the stones. I had a wonderful time reading this and I am looking forward to reading more soon. Thanks.

159514188X|5.0|I am amazed that a book that has struck such a chord in me received such negative reviews. Clearly those people who gave them are lucky enough to have never been bullied or have someone you love commit suicide. I, however, have had both. The author does an amazing job of portryaing what it is like for someone to just give up. All the little things that just add up, and cause someone to lose hope. I can't put this book down and I can't read it without crying. The truth is that you don't need to understand WHY a person feels the way they do, but that they DO FEEL that way. Everyone handles life differently and it doesn't mean their life is less significant because of that. I am starting a non profit against bullying and so far this is #1 on my list. Brilliantly done!!
1468161660|5.0|Great book. Loved it and the sequel point of retreat was just as good. I would absolutely reccommend  this book. It made me laugh and cry. It was a beautiful love story that kept you wanting more.
B007KQ6XYY|1.0|I originally gave this game 4 starts.  Its great but short.  So was the first title when it came out.  I waited around for over a month for an update for the \\"Coming soon\\" levels.  Instead they added in app purchasing.  A lot of apps are starting to do this.  With a 1,000,000+ downloads I really dont think they need to squeeze more money out of each user.  What a disappointment.  I will never buy from this developer again.
B003AKXCV6|1.0|why amazon is putting up cropped versions of classics is beyond me.<br /><br />the top and/or bottom of the image has been removed so it fits on widescreen tvs, phones, etc.<br />this is a classic film that desirves to be seen in its original aspect ratio of 1.37:1.
B00701L5XS|5.0|UPDATED REVIEW to 5 Stars since Developer explained why he had unintentionaly ended up with the Questionable Data Mining elements and Unnecessary Permissions also.  He did his homework and found a way to REMOVE the Unwanted elements from his AWESOME APP.  Thanks to Developer for a great app and his ETHICAL, Commendable response to Customer concerns.  All DEVELOPERS SHOULD LEARN FROM THIS ONE how to keep customers Happy and Loyal.  I highly Recommend this app and responsible Developer now!<br /><br />  Awesome well designed KNOT APP that is totally SAFE with NO PERMISSIONS or ADDONS.  VISUAL AIDS are excellent with several great enhancements to help the user... Vibrant 3D Graphics, Zoom that is variable, Rotation of graphics to show all views, Speed control for video demonstration of Knot process and Flipping of picture from left to right.  I was delighted to discover that these features can be gradually controlled by SWIPING FINGER on screen.  Developer has improved the app tremendously and NO ANNOYANCES at all (hooray).

B007SGM084|5.0|I was hesitant to read these books because I had never ventured in to romance novels.  I was surprised by what I read, and pleasantly so.  Most trilogies fade off into oblivion by the third book. But i was on the edge of my seat for all 3 books. I am anxiously awaiting the next book from E L James.  [[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]
B008K8H9C6|1.0|This is a dull rehash of a bad idea. A frightfully tedious and boring &quot;game&quot;. I accepted that Angry Birds was a remake of an old game, but at least it was a good idea. I fear Rovio is an uninventive, one-hit-wonder. Uninstalled and disappointing.
0345803485|2.0|So we all know there is major hype with this book.  And like all curious minds, I caved figuring it had to be at least halfway good considering all the mad crazy eyed people singing its praise.  Unfortunately, about midway into the book I kept questioning if I was reading the same thing.  From all the craze, I expected great writing, engaging characters, an interesting plot, and namely all the ingredients for a good novel. What I received in reality was a subpar erotic romance with one dimensional characters, and an iffy plot.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey starts with the main character, Anastasia, or Ana as she likes to be called, who is on the cusp of graduating college.  She's a clumsy, naïve, young female, who never wears makeup, tries to hide in a crowd, and doesn't see her own beauty.  And, because she is so utterly sweet, is cajoled into interviewing Christian Grey, a mega rich, surprisingly young man with a million dollar company, for her best friend's school paper.  From that moment forward, it seems Christian just can't keep his eyes off little Miss Ana, and manipulates a few non-chanced meetings. Things seem to get hot and heavy between them, but Christian tends to frighten Ana, especially with his needs and intense nature.  As an adopted orphan, he went through his own living hell, and has the emotional and physical issues to prove it. But Ana is slowly losing her heart to him, and can only hope that she has the stamina and strength needed to not only help Christian, but to see if he can learn to care for her as well.<br /><br />**Slight Spoilers**<br />With the synopsis, such as it is, out of the way, let me start by saying I still don't understand the hype.  If people are reading this for the erotica alone, then I pity them as there are tons of authors who actually know how to write to keep a reader engaged, and the love scenes are way hotter.  If you don't believe me, just check Amazons kindle section in fiction. They have enough variations in erotica for all kinks of life.  Now if you are going into this for the romance/plot...I still hold by my \\"there are way better authors out there\\" mentality. The plot isn't new or unique by any standard, and the writing was subpar at best.  It all boils down to Christian having major issues from being abused as a child, and because of this he uses BDSM as a form of management for his internal struggle.  It's like he has to have control over everything as an adult as he couldn't control anything as a child.  (think Sleeping with the Enemy without the husband being totally psychotic)  Ana is totally innocent in all things sexual, and Christians kink causes such a big shock that she doesn't know whether she likes it or not.  So nearly the whole book is a revolving \\"yes, no, yes, no\\" with her.  And speaking of the characters: I found that Christian had more personality than Ana, and that's saying something as this is told in first person from Ana's point of view.  Christian is definitely an alpha male (which I do love alpha males), but his personal demons cause him to be slightly cruel in my opinion. Ana is a complete spindly individual who was written so naïve that it held me in shock.  She doesn't understand some of the innuendo or \\"devices\\" Christian wants to use that even if you aren't in the world of BDSM you've at least heard of.  If I could, I would give this book two and a half stars, as it wasn't horrible, but it could've been written a lot better.  It did cause me to want to know what happens at the end, so I'll give it that, but all in all Fifty Shades of Grey just didn't do it for me, and I feel slightly duped for giving in to my curiosity.ica for all kinks of life.

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|What is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of pain? Why are we here and who are we truly? These are the questions that the characters ask themselves and we the audience think about as we live their ordeal with them.<br /><br />So what if the wolves aren't \\"realistic\\" enough. That isn't the point. The film succeeds far beyond the \\"realness\\" of the wolves or their behavior. It isn't about wolves. Sorry to break it to you but you missed the point of the film entirely.<br /><br />The film doesn't spoon feed you. You need to have some patience with the story. If you want everything laid out for you then go watch \\"What to Expect When Expecting\\" or other watered down tripe.<br /><br />A lot of people complain that this movie is \\"too depressing.\\" Well, is life always a Disney movie? Go watch Bambi and I guarantee you'll feel more uplifted and more intellectually stimulated. This film is not only a film but a piece of art.  Its meaning survives beyond the survival of the characters. We care for them and their plight and if we look deep enough we will see our own humanity in them.<br /><br />And to those who complain about the language. Did you not read the rating? Rated R. You can even see a description to why it is rated that way. The only person to blame is you. Go watch a movie with less language and you'll be content but remember what the rating is.<br /><br />As to the scene where Neeson's character \\"blasphemes\\" God. Well, I'm a Christian and even though I felt strong emotions as I saw the scene, I felt it was powerful. I have to ask you this: Were all the prophets of the Bible 100% faithful at all times. No, the were human as well. And some even complained against God. Even Jesus questioned why God had abandoned Him.<br /><br />Would you, in those circumstances, question God? Well, you don't know do you. That's the point of the film, to get you to see how you would act in those positions. It would at least get you to question mortality and the role God plays in it. Don't you think its time to finally get off your moral high horse?
0307592731|4.0|I never expected to like this book as much as I did.  And I had no idea it was on Oprah's list. (where have I been?).  I loved it. Some parts were difficult to get through, but I enjoyed every minute of the reading.  What an adventure.
0785162348|5.0|One word: fantastic. The book is put into 3 'acts' that follow the movie. The main reason I got this was to keep enjoying the movie. I love it!! There are sections for each of the characters with different drawings, and there's actually a good bit to read. You can do it 2 ways: go through quickly and just look at the pictures, or go through and read everything (recommended). They did an excellent job putting this together and I would recommend it to any Avengers fan.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|From the box office results this should be a really bad movie. It isn't great art, but it is a lot better than the general buzz would indicate. I read the original Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars stories before I saw the movie so I may have been able to make sense of some of it that the typical viewer wouldn't, but it held together well enough. The effects were quite good and all of the major characters were believable. The story, particularly in book form does seem like it is 100 years old and, if anything, the film suffers from the \\"Dune syndrome\\" - too much story to pack into 2 hours.

B004WR125O|3.0|This product item is made in China; Onkyo just labels her logo on. Maybe I should have tried a generic USB wifi adapter prior to purchase.<br />It is working as instructed; but it won't be able to connect if the SSID broadcast is disabled.<br />For those Onkyo receiver that has only one USB port, you won't be able to connect both wifi and ipod/iphone simultaneously
B000PC0S5K|5.0|My sister recommended this book that she had gotten from my daughter.  I bought the Kindle version, but will buy a hard copy to be able to share it with friends and family.<br /><br />I've never considered myself religious, but rather 'Spiritual'.  This book clarified that meaning and went way beyond.  It made me question my own materialism, trust (or lack of) and concern for the world around me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, but make sure you have a way to make notes (some are comfortable writing in books, others are not).  I love that I can take tons of notes and highlight sections in my Kindle version.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I ordered this mic due to all the great reviews it had. I also saw a great video review of it on the biggest video sharing site. The mic records in very low volume no matter what you try to do to it. I have tried microphone boost in windows 7 64-bit and I have tried using it on my iMAC running OSX Lion. I wanted to use it for video commentary on iMovie, but this mic does not deliver. However, when used this on my Canon Vixia M301 it worked great. This is why I gave it only 2 stars. I was going to give it 1 star for working somewhat. It just didn't work for what I wanted to use it for. I know some of you are thinking that I may have put the battery in backwards, nope it is in correctly. I even used my multimeter to check that it had a full 1.5v charge. I'm sorry to say, but I can not recommend this product.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I really did adore this novel.  The plot was complex and took a thoughtful reading of the text.  It made me work, but not in a draining way.  I wanted to work for this novel and it paid off for me.  There is just enough imagination and fantasy for a sci-fi/fantasy lover, such as myself, for your desire to be sated.<br />The ending is deceivingly simple.  There is a quality of dread-filled \\"what if...\\" left in its wake.  The thing that makes this ending so different is that, throughout the novel, you have been sowed with this seed of doubt that you cannot help but think like Aomame, \\"Is this real?\\"<br /><br />This novel is one that has stayed with me, playing at the edges of my mind when I'm bored.  If you love thick plots, layers of story and beautiful characters with soul and real development, then you will love \\"1Q84\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone with a passion for reading!
B006UUK612|5.0|I rented this movie for my grandchildren because it one of their mother's favorites when she was a little girl. It is an excellent movie that is family oriented and ends well for young viewers.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I fell in love with this book three years ago and to this day I am still head over heels. Simone Elkeles is an amazing writer, who has written three New York Times best selling books, one of which being Perfect Chemistry. The way she writes makes you feel as though you are there with the characters. She does this not with long paragraphs that ramble on about the setting but instead with how the characters talk and what thoughts are running through their heads. This is a feat not easily done. Elkeles makes you start to love the characters as though they are real people. It's silly but I even would have read about Alex and Brittany doing  mundane things...that's how much I loved them. Their love is gradual, all consuming, raw, real and beautiful.  It is a novel that should hold the title of being one of  the classics of this generation. I have read Perfect Chemistry at least eight times, and every time I love it more than the last.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Okay, I know I'm a little late to the Hunger Games.  Here's why:  I'm a 32 year old mom with young children.  I didn't think this book was written for me.  I haven't read the Twilight Series, and was just a tad to \\"old\\" for Harry Potter during his prime.  However, I am an avid reader.  Among my fav's, Robyn Carr, Jodi Piccoult, James Paterson, even a little Stephen King, just to name a few.<br /><br />This book (series) was something my 14 year old niece raved about.  This was a kids book, like Flowers in the Attic was when I was a tween.<br /><br />Okay, bought a kindle so I thought I'd put this book on it as my first one.  So glad I did!<br /><br />From the very beginning, I was hooked!  I COULD NOT PUT DOWN THIS BOOK!!!  It was all I could do to stop reading and take care of my family!  LOL  And it's not over!  I've started the second book.<br /><br />Maybe I'm off base.  Maybe these books weren't meant for tweens and teens alone.  Maybe they were written for everyone.  I don't know what it is, the writing style, the suspense.... I'M HOOKED!!!<br /><br />So if you're in the same position as I was, just not feeling like these are geared towards you.  Just start The Hunger Games.  You'll love it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great alert system! Accurate and timely! Stay on top of alerts wherever you are. Glad to have the app watching things for me when I'm busy or distracted.
B005LAIH9K|4.0|Absolutely As good or better than the first.It Hit's all the marks in writing,direction,acting ect..Sean William Scott & Jason Biggs produced a winner! and may have revived the franchise of American Pie. The ends credit scene with Stiffler's Mother in the Movie Theatre was funny as hell!.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have it on the kindle with the stock boot loader so I can't speak for widgets. the app looks great full screen.
0312641893|5.0|I have seen this book reviewed on blogs all over the place, but I wasn't going to read it. I love YA fiction, but I'm tiring of the romance. So many stories are sounding the same. And this one seemed at first that it was going to end up not just the same old teen romance, but also a generic retelling of Cinderella, the cyborg version.<br /><br />Well, so very not.<br /><br />So very, very not.<br /><br />Get past the first few chapters, and the story takes such a major turn from the Disney-fied Cinderella story. Yes, there is a prince. Yes there is a ball. And a nasty step-mother, and two step-sisters (one truly mean, one not quite so). But beyond that, the story becomes about a girl who is struggling with her place in society and refusing to apologize for what others have made her.<br /><br />I really connected with Cinder, and even though there were small things that bugged me about the plot and a couple of other characters, she was enough for me to overlook those minor issues.<br /><br />Also, I just have to say, there were certain things I totally predicted (like who Cinder really is), but the *very* ending was a turn I didn't quite see coming.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game a lot. I find that it is fun and some of the games are rather challenging. I would recommend this game to all!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to thoroughly agree with memoon & ds of california reviews. (Make sure you read their reviews! They wrote my sentimates EXACTLY!)<br />I downloaded the SAMPLE of the first book and am so glad i did. i was about to purchase all three but when i saw how much they would cost, figured i would check  it out first !!<br />DO NOT WASTE your time or money on the books UNLESS you're really DESPERATE for something to read!!!!
B00701L5XS|2.0|Include spyware. Lose customers. The app itself is nicely done but I don't want to share my personal information. Bye.
B00701L5XS|4.0|Got it free but I would probably buy it. The best knot app I have tried, the other apps had way less knots. It's kind of spooky reading reviews about intrusive malware. I hope that doesn't bite me. But overall supercool and useful training tool. Would be 5 stars except for the malware issue.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this app for short or long mind exercises!  The only thing that would be nice is a hint button for occasional use hee hee...I immediately enjoyed it so much on my kindle fire that I downloaded it to my phone as well for short break times....enjoy!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Just a summer read, certainly not great literature.  Got boring at times but also intriguing at times.  Not a keeper.
B008645YEE|5.0|This is absolutely one of the most phenomenal soundtracks I have ever listened to. Even if you are not a fan of the previous scores, give this one a chance. If you enjoyed Hans' work on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight...well, you are in for a show tonight son.

0439023513|1.0|The main problem I have with this book is that it's marketed to kids.  This enrages me because the pages are filled to the brim with senseless violence on a level that young children should not be exposed to!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|First of all, let me say that I have purchased the Standard Editions, the Deluxe Editions and the DVD two pack with both the original and the modified editions in them. I've pretty much bought every version that Lucas has released and I will continue to do so because I am such a big fan of Star Wars. I usually prefer having every version so when the time comes I can watch it however I want. Second, I'm not a big fan of directors changing the movies after we've seen them a hundred times and loved them every time.<br /><br />The Box Set<br />- While it was a great idea to convert these movies to Blu Ray because they do in fact need to be there given the video and sound quality those disks give off, the box set feels a little complete as other reviewers have mentioned. I would have liked to have seen some new content added in and all the versions of the movies would have been a great edition. The box set itself is really cool looking and I do like what they did with the artwork on the packaging as the box looks great. The disks are each placed in their own section with artwork from that film which is pretty cool.<br /><br />Special Features<br />- There definitely could have been some more added in but overall there are still some great features in there. The Star Wars Spoofs which have some great spoofs from TV shows over the years were a great laugh. Additionally the interviews and making of documentaries are always a good watch. The feature on Star Wars Tech and its plausibility is also one of my favorite things as well.<br /><br />The Movies<br />- They look and sound absolutely stunning. The Blu Ray format was perfectly made for these movies as they have never looked or sounded better on my surround sound system. I'm glad I purchased them because I really do notice the difference in quality and cannot say enough about how good these movies look and sound.<br /><br />The Content<br />- Never should have been added in. The scene that irks me the most is in Return and I cannot stand that he added in content. It truly takes a lot away from that scene and seems very out of place. I think that is the one scene that sticks out in my mind as an overall loss to the film. The second worst would be the sound change in Obi Wan's voice in A New Hope when he scares the Sand People. Though I will say it did make me and my friends burst into laughter the first time we saw it so if they were looking to inject some comedy into the film they may have just done so. Some of the other changes were minor things that did not bug me very much but if you are a fan of the originals and do not like changes made then this box set may not be for you. However, if you can get past these changes and accept that the movies are still great and the story is amazing then go ahead and grab it.<br /><br />Recommendations<br />- I would definitely buy it again. Despite the changes I still love the films and as I said earlier I will probably buy every version that they come out with. That being said the movies have been changed and a couple of the changes do change the tone of parts of the films. Anyone who cannot stand seeing these movies changed in any way will probably be disappointed and should stay away. Anyone else who wanted more special features may be disappointed as well as there were definitely some lacking. I think for those of you that want the original versions and do not want these versions you should wait until a more comprehensive pack comes out with all the different versions in Blu Ray format. If that day ever comes I will be the first one in line. But for now this set definitely does make a great substitute.
0062197258|5.0|I just finished this book and immediatlely gave it to my mother to read. It reminds me very much of the movie with Julia Roberts, Sleeping With the Enemy. Kept me up at night turning pages. So nice to find an edgy thriller like this!

It is already waiting near my bed....

B0019OP0GU|5.0|My nine year old daughter has been a dancer since she was three and loves all things ballet.  She read the book, Ballet Shoes by Noel Streetfield and then we rented the movie.  She loved it.  It was impossible to find it for purchase in a store so I got it here and for a great price!
B002D0L0R2|4.0|I enjoyed this moving because it is about unity i also like the 1 with ricki lake well the documentary made cry and made me want to continue to reach my dreams are acting as well it was serious it was funny it was awesome i wil say i was a little concerned because the cover looked kind of bootleg ish how ever the dvd did not scratch I saw everything clear home in just perfect
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is addicting. its something that seems really enjoyable for car rides or just to have fun in your spare time.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I think this movie was my first introduction to these two actors.  They are great.  This movie is about Rome during Nero's reign.  It will have you on the edge of your seat, from start to finish.  Liquorish
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this game almost three monthes ago, and it still never gets old!  It's so fun and a little addictive!  It's great when I'm bored or really whenever.  Even littler kids stay entertained and enjoy this game for a reasonable amount of time!  Although the best part is it doesn't require internet, and you only can buy extra coins, so those of us who are limited to free games and no buying in game content, this is great!  I absolutely love it and highly recommend it, especially for those who get bored and start playing their phone a lot!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|We watch these on tv, and then order the seasons when they come available.  These are great shows.  Kind of wierd, and sometimes gross, but always interesting.  The best thing is that I can follow the logic.  I usually can't when science fiction is involved, but these are pretty easy.  If you don't have the whole set, you can get the other seasons pretty cheaply through Amazon.  It is well worth your money.  You can watch them over and over and never get tired of them.  We don't watch much tv because we don't find much to watch.  We don't have cable, just our few local channels.  So these are great to see several times.  Liquorish
B004J4WNL2|4.0|There are a spate of recent books that aim to explain behavior and personality based on brain research.  Most are too heavy on the technical/medical/scientific \\"parts of the brain\\" discussion (with copious evolutionary diatribes thrown in) while lacking in the \\"insightful and useful\\" category.<br /><br />Not so with this book.  Susan Cain offers a readable and useful (and even entertaining!) look at the introverted personality type with a wide array of related sub-topics.<br /><br />She starts off with two great stories about the heavy emphasis of extroversion in our culture: 1) a hilarious visit to a Tony Robbins \\"personal power\\" seminar and 2) one student's experience at Harvard Business School.<br /><br />Other chapters treat subjects such as:<br /><br />-- Why, in many cases, solitary v. \\"team\\" work dynamics produce better results (she dispels the multi-tasking and brainstorming myths).<br />-- Is extroversion v. introversion genetic or learned?<br />-- Decision-making tendencies of extroverts and introverts<br />-- How to talk to, work with, and relate to those of the opposite personality type<br /><br />Also included are many real-life examples of introverted and extroverted people (some famous, some not) and their contrasting personalities, leadership styles, successes, and contributions.<br /><br />Particularly fascinating is the discussion of introverted subtypes, \\"high and low self-monitors.\\" (one type of introvert can play the extroverted part when necessary, the other can't or has considerable difficulty doing so).<br /><br />A great book, highly recommended.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I enjoy all of the Sherlock Holmes stories. I have watched these on PBS,but enjoy watching them over and over. Very well done.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|There is nothing complicated about the thesis of this book:  Nations succeed (prosper) or fail (degrade to poverty and violence) based on whether the political and economic institutions of the country are extractive (elite minority group in control rules only to extract money and power from the masses) or inclusive (broad, shared opportunity with property rights and equality of opportunity).<br /><br />Also important are \\"critical junctures:\\" certain historical events that can provide a catalyst for great change, propelling the country farther and faster down one road or the other (examples include the \\"black death\\" bubonic plague and the industrial revolution).<br /><br />The authors successfully point out the failings and inconsistencies with the prevailing theories (geography hypothesis, culture hypothesis, and ignorance hypothesis) and use the rest of the book to support their own theory.<br /><br />They use dozens of examples from ancient and modern nations and cultures, along with painstaking and well-documented research to deliver their treatise.<br /><br />Some readers might be hoping for more predictive conclusions (ie, \\"the U.S. is doomed\\" or \\"China will rule the world\\" or similar) but the authors are very clear that their theory relies heavily on many variables (particularly critical junctures) that are highly rare and unpredictable.<br /><br />This is a very compelling, informative, and well-researched book.  Highly recommended.
B004132HZS|5.0|These are done every bit as well as a Hollywood production. Both actors are excellent as Sherlock and Watson. Hope to see more of these in the future.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I had seen this book on the best seller list for a few weeks already and decided to give it a try. This is my first book review after reading endless books here on amazon. I absolutely loved this book, the characters,the easy flow of the way the book was written,the ups,downs and everything in between. I would recommend this book to everyone I know,young and not so young. Its definately a must read!
B0086700CM|2.0|I Really Like This Game.  But On The Kindle It Really Is Slow.  Is It Just Me Or Does This Happen To Everyone.  I Tried To Re-Download It &amp; Its Still Slow. This Needs to Be Fixed As Soon As Possible!
B000WTBMBK|5.0|You know how Nirvana's NEVERMIND was initially considered to be the greatest album of the 1990s, but as time wore on, it becamse clear that Radiohead's OK COMPUTER was the greatest album of that decade? Well, in the same way, while KID A was initially considered to be the most important album of the 2000s, it's becoming clearer that Burial's masterpiece is that decade's most important work. Even though the album was widely lauded, with time it's clear that it was somehow under-rated. I just can't get enough of it. Once you're hooked, you need to get a hold of the rest from this period: Burial's re-mix of \\"Where Is Home?\\" (one of Burial's best tunes) and his single \\"Fostercare\\" (ditto) are the best, but there's also \\"Shutta,\\" and his remixes of Thom Yorke (\\"And It Rained All Night\\") and Jamie Woon (\\"Night Air\\"). And of course, you'll want Burial's first album, and his various EPs. Everything he has done is essential.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I find it to be very relaxing and play every evening before bed.......helps me sleep!
B006O6F932|4.0|I acquired the Playset yesterday and was amazed. This house is larger than I anticipated and came with much more than I thought it would. The dolls easily fit in the desks and benches and can interact with the goodies it came with.<br />It is also a bit heavier than I anticipated, but that's also because it is so big.<br />I would, however, extremely recommend that a parent is present with the child's set of this toy. The joints aren't exactly fragile, but it is a little bit on the complicated side to set up.<br /><br />All in all I think this is a wonderful new addition to the Monster High line.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|Game was fun and addictive, but after update all enemies got stronger and allies much weaker. Seen Glu do this in other games, i guess they want you to spend more money...sad
1597801585|4.0|\\"The Windup Girl\\" is a well crafted and very interesting dystopia.  It has been covered in many of the other reviews, so I will not go over those same points.<br /><br />The only major drawback was that \\"the Windup Girl\\" is written in present tense.  Personally, and it is only a style opinion, but to me present tense narrative distracts from storytelling.  Additionally, there are a few graphic sex/rape scenes, but they are essential to the plot.<br /><br />All in all, I do recommend \\"The Windup Girl\\" for anyone who enjoys books like \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"The Giver\\" or \\"Hunger Games\\" or \\"The Earth Abides\\" and similar futuristic possibilities.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|One of the best office programs I've used with many options and one of the highest compatbility capabilities out there.

039472903X|5.0|I have a degree in advertising from the Univ. of Florida and have been in the business for 44 years and this book is the one to have for all the basic common sense needed in the ad world and its philosophies. I have noticed many entertaining ads on TV that have made me laugh or chuckle, but one week later I ask WHAT WAS THE PRODUCT? The most important thing is the product and its benefits. I also remember his philosophy that \\"People don't buy from clowns\\". What might seem funny to someone may seem silly to someone else and hinder its full sales impact. This is a book that is an absolute must for any student or old pro in advertising. Essential!

Behind the scenes: the blood, sweat and tears to put on the performance.<br />WHOA! Blind sided! WOW, this Movie gave more the feelings gotten from watching a horror movie! Started slowly grabbing you by the throat, and gradually choked you until the final ending!<br />Great ending music: brought you slowly back down to earth. Now you realize how powerful this movie was! Still trying to catch my breath! Great performances by all! Will recommend to others for sure.
B007TNVCBW|5.0|The book was a fun read.  The author, Debborah McClatchey, did a nice job developing the characters.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great gáme for spacial logic. Cant wait to show my 6 yr old. Good for teaching kids to think and problem solve.
0425241505|4.0|First an admission: I don't normally read paranormal romance. I came across quotes and quips from the book and laughed so hard I bought it. (Maybe saw them on Goodreads.)  This was an inventive, fun story all around. But it had it's 'meh' aspects, that kept it from being 5 stars for me.<br /><br />Specifically, I enjoyed the story of magic/parallel worlds intermingling with this one. Perhaps the 'culture clash' notion's a common trope in this genre but I found the dragon's curiosity about Twizzlers and Slurpees very funny. The narrative pace clipped right along and I found the ride exhilarating. It kept me turning pages to see what happened. The characters were intriguing, both had a wry sense of humor that was very fun to read. Laughed aloud many times. I sympathize with those who feel Dragos' character was a little too formula alpha (I do read romances avidly) the TDH billionaire, uber-male. But hell, he didn't just kill all the dark fae horses, he ate one, if that helps. And it does.<br /><br />Here's the thing I really loved, I could feel in every line just how much fun the author was having and her sense of playfulness was completely infectious. I was caught up and taken on a wild ride. That's not to say there wasn't suspense and drama, there certainly was. And her descriptions of other worldly things had specificity and the detail that made me believe it was as real as the real world, if that makes sense.<br /><br />What I didn't love: how similar Dragos and Pia, in fact all the characters, sounded. I loved the author's voice but not when playing all the parts. Everyone was wry and funny in pretty much the same way. I wish there had been more delineation between them -- frequently I had to check to see who was saying what by finding the  'he said' or 'she said's bec. otherwise I couldn't tell. Unless it was about eating meat. That was def. him, not her. I laughed a lot but the sameness distracted me.<br /><br />Also Drago's character feels less well defined. His being old as dirt didn't seem to translate into him being a more highly developed ancient, powerful creature who sometimes has ageless wisdom/cunning/insight. He resorted more often to burn your face off forcefulness. He acted more like an adolescent about her a lot of the time and I guess I wondered what he'd been doing with his time -- for eons. Was there no moment or two for mature reflection for eons? Maybe what I mean is, Dragos didn't seem to have emotional depth or intricacy to balance off the hormonal lust and shared wry humor. Then again, maybe being as old as creation is young for a dragon/man in paranormal fiction. So don't mind me.<br /><br />I found the story very entertaining. The sample of the next in the series had this hilarious inebriated line of thought: \\"Then Dr. Death was back and scowling again. Ooh. Sexy. No, scary. No, sexy. Oh phooey.\\"  She's really very funny.is being old as dirt didn't seem to translate into him being a more highly developed ancient, powerful creature who sometimes has ageless wisdom/cunning/insight.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|After hearing all the hype about this book I felt I had to take a peek. Initially I felt I'd stumbled into a stilted Harlequin Romance novel. A few chapters in and it was more like Harlequin Romance gone wild.  An okay read but not quite what I'd expected.

B00701L5XS|5.0|My only concern is that I can't pay more money to receive extra content, and that I can't share my knot tying prowess with my family and friends through social media or open feint.  And the app doesn't want access to my browsing history or contact lists.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Doesn't come close to locating me. Uninstalled. It would be close, but I rely on an accurate weather forecast/radar summary.
B00338QENI|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a while from all aspects of literature. Well written, well researched, deeply moving personally, intellectually stimulating and educational. One of the professors from our reading group is taking us to her lab to view the Hela cells. What an epiphany the book as been and will still be.<br />Dr. Judie Manulkin
0553801473|4.0|I would have preferred soft cover, but needed gift soon and soft cover wasn't available. In good condition. Arrived promptly without any inconvenience. Great price.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  I have to say that any adult that can not read without being bothered by the sex should stay away.  However, I think for adults reading the book, it is very, very good.  I do not however think it should be accessable to youngsters.  The story content is what I read.  Unlike some closed minded individual's I can read books with out letting steamy sex bother me.  I have always read this way.  If, however, you are reading it for the steamy sex sections, there is also plenty of that.  I have read the complete trilogy in just over a week, and I loved every minute of it.  But I am not a closed minded individual.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game was very hard to figure out. The help and directions assumed you played these things all the time. I am new to this type of thing so did NOT enjoy at all!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can´t believe that she comes with the only sight of him, she is always ready for him, come on... Every women knows that sometimes you are not in the mood.<br /><br />I confess that I am going to read book 2, because I´m interested on Grey´s past, but I know that it will be a torture.
030758836X|5.0|It is very hard to write a review of this book without giving any spoilers. Having read some of the reviews, I should say that you should only read this book if you like non-traditional suspense stories with rich characterization. You might also like this story if you have been intrigued by, again, DARK, stories about relationships and marriage. If you are someone who does not like a dark story, who gets prissy if there is profanity a novel, and can only invest in a story if you like the main characters, this is not for you. This is a page-turner, and in my case, a compelling listen, keeping me exercising in hot weather just so I could hear what would happen next. The narrators in the audio version, particularly Julia Whelan, are spectacular. The most wickedly entertaining book I've encountered in years.
B0014YPEI4|4.0|The Papo Allosaurus has a spectacular sculpt. The details are astonishing. The only improvement would be more articulation, especially in the arms. Now if we could just get an accurate Tyrannosaurus...
0345803485|1.0|After about half the book and wondering is Ana would become a lip-less wonder I gave up.  I knew if she kept chewing her lip, it might fall off and I was not interested.  I kept telling myself, OK, the sex parts are pretty titillating and a smoker would want to have one ( or two) after about every chapter, but seriously, is this really literature?  I can read pretty much anything as long as the author is a good storyteller and it is well written.  That is not happening here.<br /><br />Who is this guy, Christian Grey?  Nobody on the planet could have the bizillions of dollars he has at age 26 and not have been born into it, or be doing something totally illegal.  This is straight out of fantasy land and soooooo predictable. And Ana, who really lives a life like this?  She lives in the land of coffee and wants a cup of tea?  Not a skinny, double, cinnamon....from Starbucks???  My husband, knowing the hype, wants to know if I want to read aloud..... do I really want to change the sheets because he slobbered wine on them???  I have absolutely no interest in being flogged by a guy who falls asleep during Pawn Stars,  even if I do love him.<br /><br />I am bummed and was looking forward to a great summer read.  The thought of struggling through 3 of these books makes me think that life is too short to waste it on HOLLY SHIT, UM, AHH, TILT OF THE HEAD, ETC.  Granted I was coming off some great reading like Guns, Germs and Steel,  mixed with  with the predictable but very entertaining Patterson and Sanford and Connley , and wishing I could find more The Glass Castle type ( one of the best I have read in a bit- and all of her books are great), so this one's just gotta go.  If it had been half as much fun as the Twilight Saga, it would have made my summer. Franky, Ana can't hold a candle to Bella.  I swore I would never read\\"Those Vampire books\\" but a fine example of a good story teller.  Thankfully, I have a come across some great old James Michner and will spend the Dog Days of Summer re- reading Hawwaii, Alaska, with the Source, Centennial  and more.  I would also recommend the Days of Wonder.  Maybe if they come up with the Cliff Notes, I might give these another try, but seriously, life is just too short.
B0086700CM|5.0|Haven't had this game very long, but I love it.  I'm not as good at it as my grandkids are, but working on it.  It's a challenge and keeps the adrenalin flowing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like that you can switch versions of the bible easily and that it is with me all of the time because I have it on my Android phone.  I like the different plans and that it will send me a reminder each day if I want it to.  It is easy to find a verse quickly because you select the book, then the chapter and finally the verse.  Would recommend to everyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. I've never been the type to read sexy novels but this one was so hyped up so I that I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I'm almost done with book three!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is a amazing game I love it and play all the time on my droid. I just got for my kindle fire and need neighbors. My storm 8 id is Blackhawk2424
B00701L5XS|5.0|This app is one of the best references I've ever seen for tying knots.  There is a quick animation for each type of knot, and you can rotate the image 360 degrees so you can get a good look at it.  The app also describes the uses for each knot and its advantages and disadvantages.  It covers just about every knot you could ever need to tie, though disappointingly, it leaves out necktie knots entirely.<br /><br />It works great on my Motorola Xoom tablet (though only in portrait mode) and my HTC Evo LTE.<br /><br />EDIT:  When I originally wrote this review, the app was loaded with spyware such as OpenFeint and Flurry and a ton of permissions.  Since then, the developer has listened to the reviews and removed all that junk.  The new version of this app has no permissions and no spyware!<br /><br />This is a 5-star app and a definite must-purchase for anyone who goes camping, fishing, sailing or climbing, or anyone who just wants to learn to tie a proper knot.
0345803485|5.0|It's an exciting taboo that we do t speak about but think about.<br />I loved it and could wait for more to come.
B005LAII9O|4.0|Don't read this review. Don't read any of the reviews. Don't even watch the previews or trailers because they all pretty much sell the movie wrong anyway. Just go see Savages.<br /><br />If you want to know a little more, you'll probably just get turned off or confused in the process.  Just watch the movie instead.<br /><br />Savages is bloody, outrageous, unbelievable, realistic, completely hilarious and exactly what movies are supposed to be.  In fact, Savages is everything right that Oliver Stone's U-Turn got very very wrong.<br /><br />Savages is really entertaining.<br /><br />Don't take it seriously. Don't expect a message or moral. Don't go in with expectations. Don't try to pick apart the story, performances or violence. You'll simply kill it in the process. Save a few victims, everybody in the film is having a heck of a lot of fun on screen and so did I watching it. Savages exists almost entirely to entertain and it succeeds admirably.<br /><br />Everybody has it wrong, this isn't in 3D, it isn't a drug movie, chase movie or action movie.  Savages just gives you your money's worth.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|A true Santana fan is usually a huge fan of his skills as the consummate guitar player. Beginning with the guitar/piano duet, &#34;Treat&#34; from the Santana debut, almost if not all of his studio albums have at least one guitar instrumental. &#34;Abraxas&#34; has the powerful, &#34;Incident at Neshabur&#34;, &#34;Caravanseari&#34; has &#34;Song of the Wind&#34;, &#34;Amigos&#34; sports the nirvana &#34;Europa&#34; all the way through to &#34;Supernatural&#34; with &#34;The Calling&#34; with Eric Clapton. Carlos' guitar makes love to you and can make you cry if the mood strikes. During the reign of the cassette and/or burning of your own CDs, I made my own instrumental compilation. In the era of downloads, a fan can create their own playlist. (Playlist still cannot match the seamless track to track fluidity of mixing and burning your own CDs).  After &#34;Shaman&#34; and even more so, after &#34;All That I Am&#34;, Santana fans yearned for a classic Santana album. On those two albums, Carlos was sounding more and more like a guest star on his own album. Even on his landmark comeback opus, &#34;Supernatural&#34;, my favorite tracks as a platinum level Santana fan, my favorite tracks were the classic Santana tracks and not one of the many high profile duets. The Clive Davis formula of marrying Carlos to a guest vocalist really, really wore out its welcome by the time the tedious, below Carlos standards-tracks, for &#34;Guitar Heaven&#34; were released, I became fearful for Carlos' legacy. The man who jingo-rocked at Woodstock, was transforming into a lounge act.  While I am forever grateful for the global phenomenon, &#34;Supernatural&#34;, Clive instructed Carlos to create more radio friendly fare. I would be even more impressed if he could buck trends again, and make &#34;Shape Shifter&#34; a commercial success.  So it was with a degree of excitement I welcomed &#34;Shape Shifter&#34;. (My favorite series, &#34;True Blood&#34; introduced me to the concept of a shape shifter). The fact that the album was also on Carlos' new indie label, &#34;Starfaith&#34; made it that more appealing. The standouts include the opening title track, &#34;Angelica Faith&#34;, &#34;Never the Same Again&#34;, &#34;In the Light of a New Day&#34; and &#34;Canela&#34;. If there is a downside its that some tracks border on being Adult Contemporary. There are no rock tracks with the fire of &#34;Incident at Neshabur&#34;. On &#34;Shape Shifter&#34;, the man that electrified Woodstock, is hardly in evidence. Of course, as Carlos is pushing 70, we can only celebrate his wondrous achievements and simply celebrate the fact that he is still able to tour globally, has swept the Grammys and has nearly 20 gold/platinum albums in the United States alone. I still treasure my homemade CD Burn compilations, one being chronological and another sequenced seamlessly with songs that compliment each other sonically. &#34;Shape Shifter&#34; was most gratifying when tracks show up in the &#34;shuffle mode&#34;, beckoning me to confirm exactly what song that now registers as a newfound gem. I am almost tempted to increase my rating to 5 stars. But I have yet to find &#34;Shape Shifter's&#34;, &#34;Samba Pa Ti&#34; or &#34;Song of the Wind&#34;. I would not be the least surprised to discover it while listening to the iPod in &#34;shuffle mode&#34;.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There is a lot of games and you have to unlike the games and when you play the game you earn pionts
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I have a pair of nice Sennheiser headphones but they have almost no bass to them. Using the bass setting on this has made listening quite enjoyable. I'm happy with this item. One thing I will note is that when the battery dies the sound just cuts out completely. There's no warning of any kind.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app its fun smiling. giggles has other games and reminds. u to play them because they are All alike
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This little piece of equipment has been the best audio purchase under $100s...ever. Using my laptop to play lossless audio @24/192 upscale from 16/41, my wife..noticed stereo imaging she had never heard before. Music has never sounded so good from my vintage bedroom setup. :)
B004UID2LC|3.0|this app is pretty cool but on my kindle fire it always fails and takes me back to the main menu I reccomend this to anyone who doesn't have a kindle fire
B007J4T2G8|1.0|BORING and POORLY WRITTEN! I am so glad I did not purchase the trilogy as I was barely able to get through Book One. I really don't understand all the hype. Totally unrealistic - on all levels. I have read better sex scenes in Penthouse. And if I ever hear or read \\"Holy Crap\\" again - I'll scream! LOL.  Who talks or thinks this way? I am dismayed that teenagers are reading this drivel. Such an insult to their intelligence.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this app is awesome. there is a huge variety of games and it never gets boring. you should get this app!
B004YF6MHW|2.0|I fail to see the appeal of this app.  It might seem functional to people with lesser phones, but it doesn't seem to have any more useability than the stock camera app on my Epic Touch 4G.  I'm not saying it's bad, I just feel like I wasted my money.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|If they would ever give out awards for Blu-ray.....This would be the one to take it.<br />I have a couple hundred Blu-ray discs and I, personally, think this is the best disc that was ever pressed. I've seen Singing In The Rain in the theater, on VHS, on Bata Max, CED videodisc, Laser Disc and DVD. But, WOW, I have never seen this movie look and sound so good. You've got to see  it! WOW!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton is an awesome writer!  After reading The Forgotten Garden, The House at Riverton was just as intriguing and did not disappoint.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My family and I take turns playing so we make it a family bonding time.  We think it is fun and challanges us to compete against each other.
B00122OCQI|4.0|I thought that I had this on CD but I couldn't find it.  When I saw it on sale I immediately bought it! It has some of my favorite songs, Never Let Me Down, The Things You Said, Strangelove, Sacred, Little 15, Behind The Wheel, Nothing, Pimpf, Pleasure Little Treasure, Route 66.  I'm listening to it as I write this review!  Their mix of melancholy lyrics and electronic/dance music just goes so well!  Even the instrumental tracks are great! (PIMPF, Agent Orange, Stjarna)  I always like an eclectic mix for my MP3 player, so I usually have a lot of DM on it!  I have to stop now so I can do some more shopping!
B0086700CM|2.0|For my birthday I get a Kindle Fire. I see my cousin play this game on her iphone (no lag) and then I give it a try. I love it, so I install it on my Kindle. I got to 1,500,000 points and that's when the LAG hit me. Not as bad at first but absolutley terrible now so I am disappointed in this game...
1594203334|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book. The author brings up interesting observations of her own and of those she interviews. It is also great for an expat parent perspective. This is not a \\"how to parent\\" book but it makes you think more about how other cultures raise their children. I also loved \\"How Eskimos Keep their Babies Warm.\\"
B007SGM084|5.0|I read a lot of mixed reviews about these books. I was apprehensive at first to purchase them because of this. Since purchasing a little over a week ago, I have already finished the first book and am well into the second. I have been pleasantly surprised by them. If you're into books with a mysterious hero, and an innocent heroine, these are definitely for you. I have not been able to put them down. There are a lot of sex scenes and some of them rather dark, but they really get the blood flowing! Go ahead and click the buy button....you won't regret it!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I really like it! I have a page on Facebook and now that I have this app I can make so many cool pictures and games with pictures. Without this app I wouldn't of been able to further my page's occupancy
0307887448|5.0|A new all-time favorite! It's 2044 and 18 year old Wade Watts lives in poverty in a trailer park \\"stack\\" with his abusive aunt. Like everyone else, Wade spends most of his time in the Oasis, a virtual-reality combination of the Internet and MMO games. Five years earlier, when he was dying, the creator of the Oasis, James Halliday, developed a contest, with the prize being his fortune. Success in the contest depends on the player's thorough knowledge of 1980s pop culture, which with Halliday was obsessed, having grown up in the 80s. Wade's only goal since then, is to win the contest and escape the stacks. Don't be turned off by its geekiness or if you are too young to remember the 1980s -- it's compulsively readable, with painstakingly detailed settings and a fast-paced plot.
0345803485|1.0|I got half way through the book and stopped reading it and had friend telling me the ending. The writing was horrible and the storyline dragged on. Don't bother reading this crap.
B00701L5XS|4.0|A very helpful App, which I always appreciate when it also happens to be the Kindle Fire's App of the Day. I wish it didn't require WiFi, which is ok as long as I'm at home but it would be nice to be able to open it at the lake or on a boat. I guess I can always use it to learn refresh &amp; practice my knot's at home. Many people mention spyware,  which does bother me a little.  Most of the apps with spyware I usually keep Cloud stored &amp; I  only download them as needed,  but I'm not sure that helps, other than to make me feel more secure.
B005L3HJ8M|5.0|The record arrived in perfect shape and sounds absolutely beautiful.  The music itself I have heard already as I downloaded the CD.  I love this album.  10/10 song writing.  I saw them live recently and my mind was blown.  I dare you to see them play these songs live and dislike them afterwards. It's impossible. Buy this album. Now.
B002ZG9846|1.0|PO'd about the fact that my Digital copy arrived expired. There should not be an expiration on these things. We should be guaranteed of getting what we pay for. This is the second time this has happened. My Digital copy of The Wizard of Oz was expired too. I am paying for something I am not getting.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Nine years later and I still enjoy this album as much as always.the more you hear it the better it gets,yes even 9 years later...
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This app is super easy until you get about half way thru the 8x8's then it jumps to just easy. mediocre app
B004FOA84A|3.0|This really was a nice game but it was over too quick. The game has good graphics and very little stalling. Give it a try.
B005LAIGIM|4.0|In my opinion good comedians always seem to get themselves into movies that don't really show just how funny they are. Leaving them to take on roles that just leave you bewildered. From \\"Norbit\\" to \\"Daddy Day Care\\" to \\"Dr. Dolittle\\" Eddie Murphy has taken on a string of movies that didn't do a good job of exemplifying his comedic value. A Thousand Words, in my opinion, is a breathe of fresh air compared to some of Eddie's other works.<br /><br />This is one of those movies where the overall message can be different for each viewer. For me the overall message was not only to watch what you say, but to fully understand how powerful words can be. Jack McCall (Eddie) has no grasp of this concept, he talks continuously constantly trying to manipulate people to do what he feels is best for him, and in the end it winds up being his downfall.<br /><br />One thing that really bothered me while watching this film was Jack's wife Caroline (Kerry Washington.) Everything about her character just irritated me. Jack was unable to talk so she automatically took it as he didn't want to talk to her and went to the conclusion that he didn't love her. Then when they were in the hotel and she was trying to find the \\"spark\\" in their \\"broken relationship\\" she tried to get him to talk. It was clear he wanted to talk and it was clear he was having some sort of internal struggle regarding it, but she paid all that no mind and walked out with his clothes. I don't know why it bothered me so much, it just did. Probably because I know there are some women out there who do in fact react like that.<br /><br />I did feel they pushed the limits regarding the PG-13 rating. The profanity is a little more frequent compared to some other PG-13 films, you see Jack flip off the tree, and you see his wife dressed in a sexual role-playing outfit. Some material parents might find inappropriate for their young teens.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - As I said compared to some of Eddie's other works this is pretty enjoyable. It's not perfect, and some parts do come off stale, but overall it's a good comedy film. As a stand-up comedian I feel Eddie is hilarious, but he always seems to come up short when he's in a movie.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Great refresher for a firemen or outdoor enthusiasts. Its nice to get a useful FAOTD. Nice polished program much better than other apps I have tried. More knots and a lot more useful information.
B00782O7IY|5.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Every couple of years there comes a movie that shakes up the industry, and The Artist is one of those films. When I originally saw the trailer I automatically wanted to see it. Me being 19 years old I missed out on the Black and White/Silent film era. So for me watching this movie was experiencing a part of history. Yes, the film did receive a lot of hype based around two things: the fact that it was black and white and the fact that it was, for the most part, silent. But once you watch the film you realize just how amazing the story is.<br /><br />You follow George Valentine (Jean Dujardin) who is a silent film actor. But he's not just any silent film actor, he's one of the biggest. The story starts in 1927 at the premiere of his new film, where he bumps into Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) who will eventually become a big name in the film industry. A few years later Al Zimmer (John Goodman) informs George that they are terminating the creation of silent films and are moving on to talkies. George does not take the news well and decides to fund the production of his new film, which bombs. Leaving George broke. I won't go into further detail so as not to ruin it for those who haven't yet seen the film.<br /><br />On the surface it's a simple, yet enjoyable, film. But if you dig deeper it's a big reflection on society's struggle to adapt and accept change. We as humans have a hard time with change, and so we desperately try to cling to what we're comfortable with. It's a concept that I felt was extremely well done. The acting was top notch, as was the music, and the cast was excellent. I enjoyed finding some other, lesser known, actors within the film. (Joel Murray and Bill Fagerbakke both have small appearances.)<br /><br />Overall Score: 10/10 - This film is truly a joy to watch and deserves every award that it won. It was a risky move to create not only a black and white film, but a silent film as well. However, I feel they pulled it off. It's amazing to see that without dialogue just how important the acting becomes. If you were a fan of this era than I highly suggest you check out this film.
0307592731|5.0|I have read and loved reading Cheryl Strayed's Dear Sugar column for years, though I did not realize that she was behind the column until I recognized a familiar style in this book.<br /><br />The book is just wonderfully written leaving you feeling as though you are walking along with her. In fact, the book made me want to quit my job to move out west and hike the PCT hopeful that I could grow and gain some insight as well.<br /><br />Even though I have not lost a mother, gone through a divorce or addiction Strayed makes it so easy to relate to her and her struggles, to understand why she needed to separate herself and most importantly, to gain something from the lessons she learns along the way.<br /><br />The book is about grief, anger and forgiveness. It is about inner strength, letting go and stepping up. About how sometimes the only way to find yourself is to lose yourself.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough, it is without a doubt the best book I have read all year and is already an all time favorite.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|As a 75 year old senior citizen who never took the time to read the classics when growing up I decided to go back and start with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I enjoyed the way in which the author used the dialect of the times in which these young men grew up in the South.  Will move ahead and read Huckleberry Finn and then switch over to The Last of the Mohicans.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|My teenage daughter asked me to buy this book for her but after reading the reviews I wasn't sure it was appropriate so I decided to read it first.  Well, I must say I was quite surprised by some of the descriptive sex scenes and decided that it is most definitely NOT for young readers.  However, I did find the book very addictive & entertaining ... even though some of the phrasing was very repetitive at times.  I read the first book in a few days, whizzed through the second and am nearly finished the third.  I can't put them down!
B000PEX1IE|3.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />I saw this film because I really like the theme song; however, the story itself is a ghostly mess. Incoherent, rambling and nonsensical. I'm not really much for comedies, though I do like some comedies.<br /><br />How the hell can a scene implying oral sex be deemed appropriate for a PG movie that is supposedly okay for kids to see? (Last time I checked, G and PG mean the movies are okay for kids to view). Idiot screenwriter. Titanic should have been rated R, with the nudity and implied sex scene.<br /><br />I like Casper and Casper: A Spirited Beginning; however, this movie is like the Stay-Puft Marshmellow Man: melting with fervent heat. Three stars for the catchy theme song.
0783114222|2.0|The product details online say that the aspect ratio is 1.33:1 (4:3). The box and all the CDs say 16:9 widescreen and it is wide screen (16:9) when you play the CDs.<br /><br />This means that this is not an original version as advertised. It also means that top of people heads are cut off and what takes place at the bottom of the screen is missing.<br /><br />You get 5 CDs not 4 so what I am guessing they are advertising (selling you) one version and shipping a different version.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i got it and loved it as much as i love my family. i recommend this app. buy it nooooooooowwwwww[...]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My Review:<br /><br />I am going to start my review with the fact that this was one of my first books of this kind. I was kinda of amazed that I really liked it.<br /><br />Author Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer. The descriptions, characters and the things that happened in this book caught my attention and held it from the beginning to the end. Could not wait to get my hands on the next book. I actually went out that evening late, which is something I do not do and went to Wal-Mart and bought Catching Fire and Mocking Jay. Did not want to wait.<br /><br />If you have read this one, tell me:<br />Why does Katniss need to make her face \\"an indifferent mask\\" and be careful what she says in public?<br /><br />Katniss's relationship between Gale and Prim and with her mother is really interesting. She is just a kind of daughter any one would be proud of.<br /><br />I do not want to give any thing away. So I am not going to get into much of the book. But to know that you well be on camera always as a tribute would be crazy for me. Then the games, wow is all I will say here. You need to really read. Just imagine if this really could take place, what or how would you feel?<br /><br />This book was my own. And this is my honest opinion of the book and Author.<br /><br />So for the reasons above. I am giving this book my Breath of Life rating of:<br /><br /> FIVE CLOCK RATING!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So far, really enjoying this game. Addicting and fun bit not challenging enough, at least not yet. There are 5 difficulty levels with about 20 levels in each. I am on level 6 of the middle difficulty mode. Not bad though. Entertaining at least.
B00701L5XS|1.0|Tried to install, then it said it had to have wifi and wouldn't let me cancel the download. should have said this before I tried to install.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My kindle battery stopped charging for some reason. This app. pin pointed that my kindle fire's failed to charge  the battery even while being plugged in.  So I made a call and the Kindle fire got re placed free.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|This movie took me totally by surprise in a good sense. It was not what I was expected. I definitely didn't expect to see a four star prison with a mall in Mexico. Mel is really good in this movie and I like the narrative part. I gave it four stars because of the totally predictable ending. Just give a gun to Mel and he is going to take care of the rest. On a side note the movie, while being a satire, also shows the corruption of the officials that we have at the borders which may explain a lot of the current problems in this country.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I received my Marware Microshell Folio cover from Amazon for my Kindle Fire recently and it is more than I expected. It fits the Kindle Fire perfectly and is very lightweight. It is the white color and for an older person like myself, it is very easy to see, especially in a darker area of the house. I really like the way it sits up when you bend it back. It is well worth the money and I highly recommend this product to others. I am very pleased with it.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|I played Ico when it was originally released for the PS2 and was very excited to find out that it would be re-released for the PS3 with a high-definition makeover. However, many of the textures were NOT given a makeover, making them look out of place in the beautiful environment of the game. As for \\"Shadow of the Colossus\\", I had never played it before purchasing this combo and am very pleased it was included. It has a great story line and has fun game play, but again, the textures were not re-done for this HD remake and were simply blurry
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book should become a modern classic.  I read it years ago, then again when my teenage son got hooked.  It's appropriate for young adults.  But I loved it as much now as I did the first time - broad age appeal.  The hole series is good, but the first book is the best.  Very captivating and interesting.  Well developed characters with some surprises and twists in the plot.  This book needs to be on high school reading lists.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. Haven't had any problems. Now I can see what the weather will be no matter where we go.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I've read the hole series and am starting to feel like I'm hooked on a fantasy soap opra.  The story is never ending.  No one lives happily ever after and many don't survive at all.  The plot is complex and unpredictable.  The author isn't afraid to kill-off a primary character (those are a shock).  It makes the story line very realistic.  The descriptions and language are a little crude and there are a lot of sexual situations (though not as explicit as the TV series).  These books are on the edge of tolerable for me but I'm pretty sensitive.  Overall, I'm really enjoying this series.  It hasn't gotten old or repetitive the way may series do. The later books don't come to a conclusion, they just end the book when they end the chapter.  I'm ready for the next book.
B00701L5XS|1.0|Wow.  Anything for a buck I guess.  A great app with TONS of potential, and then they ruin it with all the spyware garbage.  Such a letdown.  Stay away from this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! no glitches and is quick. would be nice if I could pause it but overall its a great game! I love unlocking new levels!
B00756GRUE|5.0|Excellent watch.  Rugged and easy to see and has maintained the accurate time to the second for a month now.  The time keeping is so good that I ordered a dressier Seiko solar for other use.  The only criticisms I have are few.  The metal band doesn't work for me - highly irritating.  Replaced it with a Seiko rubber band that I don't even know I'm wearing anymore.  The date indicator is a loser.  Need a microscope to see it.  If they were going to use something that small, they should have put a magnifier over it.  The 24 hour indicator is useless.  They could have employed a GMT clock or, better still, put a day/date indicator in its place.  Another thought would have been an stopwatch indicator that measures hours since the other one only measures 60 minutes.  Not good for long trips.  All in all though, the positives far outweigh the negatives.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I loved it. it was fun to buy all the animals and design a village.I think everyone should get this game
B004AKCME8|4.0|I bought this movie new. I love the movie itself but when i turned the case over the back was cut through the plastic where the barcode label was. That is my only complaint. The movie itself is awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|I would recommend this game to a friend. Only because its really fun when it doesn't freeze and its very additive ..... I like it...
034580404X|4.0|Very INTERESTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This was well written, much to my surprise.  Can't wait to start book two and three.<br /><br />  Author has a great imagination.  WOW !!!!

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I will say first, I'm not a fan of Matt Damon, but this time he does justice to America. There are no political rantings in the film, just the cold hard facts. The blame falls neither on Republicans or Democrats, instead it shows the corruptness of Washington and its failure to regulate the industry more than capable of destroying the world economy, all the while lining their pockets and claiming ignorance as they sip on martini's and laugh at hard working Americans.<br /><br />I watched the meltdown of the 80's and 90's from the fabled Savings and Loans. How many of them went to jail? None. How many were extradited from the countries they fled with billions of Americans dollars? None! I was working for a small paving contractor in Dallas,Tx. when the bubble burst. Overnight, job sites were shut down and within weeks, Contractors were filing bankruptcy because the funds would never be collected. One contractor alone took a 60million hit in uncollectibles. They were one of the largest and strongest in the area. They survived by selling off 60% of their equipment, laying off hundreds of workers and selling the corporate headquarters. They paid the price of a failed financial industry.<br /><br />The same thing has happened again. No one paid but the American working class.<br /><br />I have no problem with Capitalism, I have a problem with unregulated speculative greed. The real crime, those responsible for this last disaster have retained their power and make no apologies for the disaster. It wasn't their fault. If not there's then who? The American worker? The migrant workers? Must be overcrowded jails. Yeah that's it. Problem is, the jails aren't holding the real criminals. No, they are still telling us how brilliant they are and keep flaunting their books, credentials and PhD's telling us how smart they are and how stupid we are. THIS MUST CHANGE!<br /><br />We've survived two financial Tsunami's, I fear we won't weather a third. It is time for change. It is time for a candidate to run for American and not Wall Street and Private Investment firms. It is time for Americans to take notice and realize they have a brain not matter what we are bombarded with day to day.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|like the game so far but energy gets used up fast can only do so much things a day but over all decent game id  say
030758836X|2.0|The story was so far-fetched.  It was hard to believe that Amy could out-think, confound and befuddle everyone; even the FBI.  There were so many twists and turns, that were fun at first, but grew old and annoying.  Beyond frustrating ending which made me feel I went on this draining, exhausting journey with Nick and Go and Boney only to find we went no where.  The story itself, however, before it got too convoluted was well written and enjoyable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|as much as I could hope for in an app. does a solid job at exactly what it claims to do for free.
B007AR7QQC|5.0|This set covers only a modest portion of the extensive discography of Gustav Leonhardt with Bach's music. Leonhardt might not be for everybody's taste (and I too have some reservations, at times) but his artistry and elegance are  indisputable. The master's legacy endures. This is a very recommendable set.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|I never was a gamer till I got my Kindle Christmas past. I tried this game as my first choice and have enjoyed playing it very much. I like the fact that you can slow or quicken the pace of the game so it's challenging yet enjoyable.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Not sure why some people are having problems downloading to Kindle Fire, worked fine for me! If you like Where's My Water, you'll like this, same concept. I love it and it's well worth the 99 cents!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This works great. I enjoy tracking storms.  The graphics are sharp.  It is very accurate.  Have had no problems with this app.  Fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the best book ever. It was good for the obvious reasons, but also had a really good story line. I couldn't wait to read them all. By the time I finished the third one I was in love with Christian Gray. Can't say enough about how good these books were.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My daughter begged me to start reading,  I haven't read a book since college. Started many but couldn't finish,  because I had no interest.  She started me on 50 shades and I could not put it down. Wish I could find more llke this!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Great read, story plot very good, erotica interesting, not applicable to my life, not something I think is healthy, but love a good ending
B005LAIH9K|2.0|An OK movie like all the movies of the series with a lot of juvenile, funny moments. Cannot watch it with your kids. Not appropriate for young kids.<br /><br />Movie is made of predictable bad jokes by adults who never grew up, during a high school reunion. But then what would you expect from this bunch? Not as good as the first two, much more dirty (in language and inuendos) than the first two movies. Really degrading to young women.<br /><br />Movie shows what really happens to people who don't get a real life and keep going to these totally unnecessary high school reunions. Get a life and put high school behind you. Stop thinking about the past and look into the future. Move on!<br /><br />Two stars for the juvenile jokes that are really funny...if your are into these kind of jokes.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I was only expecting a how-to. The interactive diagram and general info about the knots are a great benefit. Highly recommended.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Outstanding movie, five stars all the way. Jennifer Lawrence is a great actrice with great future.<br /><br />The movie describes a futuristic society where young people have to compete once a year. Last person standing wins. Everybody else must be dead in order to win.<br /><br />I saw this movie the day it came out at midnight. The theater was packed. What a great movie! Great acting all around, and ...maybe it tells the future, i.e. where we are going from here. Maybe it will happen sooner than you think. The hunger games at a city near you. Cannot wait for the sequel!<br /><br />On a side note and for the Blu Ray makers: PLEASE STOP THAT ULTRA VIOLET THING!!!! Put in the itunes code and let us see this wonderful movie on ipod, ipad etc. That ultraviolet thing is unfriendly and not very portable!
B005VPRETE|5.0|My 7 yr. old grand daughter loves this, an is now addicted to all of LEGOs kits. We spend hours putting them together and I just love hearing her talking to each of the LEGO Friends girls. An as far as AMAZON, their the greatest.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Update June 2016 - Developer changed the app so it does not require any permissions.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it...I really like the fact u can play without wifi and it is very addictive but lots of fun...and I have not spent any real money.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|nice game. moves quick so you don't have to wait forever to move along in it. would recommend to anyone who likes to build towns.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|its a great app for telling when to charge your kindle and it just really keeps you aware of your battery.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great continuation of the Percy Jackson series.  I've read all of the Percy Jackson series and seen when they were comming out with this I read them again.  Definatly would highly recommend this series.
B002QXI2L8|5.0|This ballet was created in 1975 but was then dropped from the repertoire until 1991 when it was revived. This revival was the result of close collaboration between Pina Bausch and the original dancers, Dominique Mercy and Malou Airaudo whereby the original ballet was painstakingly pieced together and reconstructed fragment by fragment. Early operas, such as this by Gluck, were frequently performed with extensive dance episodes and this is a similar idea but in reverse with the singing used to reinforce the dance.<br /><br />Essentially this very familiar story is very simply told and is all the more effective as a result. The story is re-enacted through dance and portrays the changing relationship between Orpheus and Eurydice as the nature of their love for each other is finally tested to destruction.  This situation is constantly reinforced by two singers who sing Gluck's music which mirrors the story being illustrated by the dance at any one time. This is a close collaboration and achieves a very powerful synthesis. There are some off-stage choral sections as well and these are similarly linked to the dance action. The story in this version does not include Orpheus's final fate of having to wander the earth before being torn limb from limb by the Maenads but ends instead with the unresolved deaths of Orpheus and Eurydice.<br /><br />For me the tragic story in this format reaches a conclusion that can only be described as even more harrowing than usual. In a way, this could be described as a dance drama with singing. There is nothing here to offend purists from either dance or music camps and much to gain for both. The staging is minimalist but totally effective in so far as it does not detract from the very stark message of the narration. The corps de ballet reinforce the narrative with danced re-enactment of the described events as they unfold. The two lead roles of Orpheus and Eurydice, as performed by Yann Bridard and Maria Wesseling, fully convey the increasing levels of distress and despair of the two as they make their fated return journey to the land of the living only to fail at the last hurdle.<br /><br />The music is presented in both high quality 5.1 surround sound and stereo and the camera work provides clarity and detail without being invasive or destructive of the production.  This is a powerful concept and is performed with both sympathy and skill and there seems little chance of a choice of performances being offered to future purchasers.  However, bearing in mind the excellence of this production, it seems unlikely that it would be significantly improved upon. For those who are attracted to the program, this should give a great deal of satisfaction and it would therefore seem to reasonable to rate this as a clear 5 star issue.g levels of distress and despair of the two as they make their fated return journey to the land of the living only to fail at the last hurdle.<br /><br />The music is presented in both high quality 5.1 surround sound and stereo and the camera work provides clarity and detail without being invasive or destructive of the production.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I'm very pleased with this product overall, but I'll start with the negatives first as that may influence some purchases.  The only negatives I can list is that I'm not finding this set as comfortable as others are claiming.  It pinches under the ears and I have to really fiddle with it to keep my ears from rubbing inside the cups when I move my head.  However, I'm so pleased with the sound and mobility (and I've tried so many other headsets that were much, much worse in both sound and comfort, I'm determined to make these work regardless). The other issue is that out of the box, the volume control on the headset didn't seem to work.  I'm hopeful this is corrected once I play around with the software, but it seems like its a pretty standard audio control.  Its not a big issue to me as I typically control the volume in other places, but I can see how this would affect many.  I saw an option in the software suite to buy additional voice morphs.  This is a big red flag.  It doesn't affect this product at this time for me, but it seems like now we need to keep an eye out for micro-transactions with our hardware.  This could be a deal breaker pending what they choose to sell separately and I'll be watching for this on future products from Logitech.<br /><br />The sound is incredible.  Going through my MP3 collection it is immediately obvious which songs were developed with multiple channels in mind.  Sounds pop out audibly while others songs are extremely flat.  I also checked out some Youtube samples for 7.1 to try and get a nice test and its amazing what these things can do.  The sound really gets inside your mind and can actually disorient you for a bit until you get used to sounds circling around your head.  I fired up a few games, and even when 7.1 wasn't actually supported, the games still sound much better than my previous 5.1 wired headset.  I'm hearing sounds in stuff I do everyday that I never heard before. These continuously play crisp, clean sounds and the kicker is that you don't have to crank the volume up to hear the subtle effects and background noises.  You can still hear the pin drop and also not go deaf from the gun shots.<br /><br />I paid $150.00 for a wired 5.1 headset.  This WIRELESS 7.1 set is $109.00 at this writing.  So it gets 3 thumbs up in the price category as well (that's right, I have a third thumb for just such an occasion).<br /><br />The wireless feature is also working very well.  In spite of its advertised performance I was still expecting lag and choppy audio as I moved away from the PC.  I walked through 2 rooms and back without any noticeable issues.  The USB cable that lets you use it while its charging is very nice.  With cable extensions in both directions you have lots of options on where to place the base.<br /><br />If the volume control on the headset worked out of the box, I'd give this 5 stars.  Comfort is too hard to gauge when we all have different sized heads.  Every other aspect of this device has been wonderful so far.
B000SGSU58|3.0|Concrete Blonde is ok. Not great but ok. Bosch is introspective in this story. He is still Bosch but looks inside a bit. I suppose it is some better than other Bosch yarns in some ways but the end is too much. I don't buy the end at all.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I've had my Tom's for over a year now and I've worn them almost every other day. They are so comfortable! When I first got them I was a bit nervous about the size. I got a five, which is the size I usually wear, and they felt a bit tight. But since they are canvas, they stretched out to a perfect fit within the first couple wears. They are starting to get a small hole near the tag on the side, but I'm surprised they've lasted this long (as most shoe companies only make their shoes to withstand 6 months or so of regular wear) I've had these things through rain, sand, bike rides, even running! I know some of my friends have a hole in the toe of theirs but if you keep your toe nails short then it shouldn't happen, it also depends on the shape of your toes i suppose. The only thing negative I would have to say is that they start to smell bad if you wear them in rain too many times, I don't have any problem with my shoes smelling bad without socks usually, but the rain did it. Luckily they are completely washable! I put them in the washer and dryer with no problem, just a little shrinkagew hich can be fixed by wearing them.
B008JH5ID0|5.0|Give this movie a chance!  If you are a sci-fi buff, you will love it.  Snow is the classic protagonist, bad boy. Great acting and story line.  The CG was modest but highly entertaining.  The plot is fast forward and all the scenes end in magical moments where they escape just in time or live to fight another day - a very rewarding, soon-to-be cult classic! Definitely set up for a sequel.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|I always dreamed of having a complete series collection of Friends. When the price went down, I went for it and bought the series as a birthday present for myself. The package arrived very quickly and very well wrapped in bubble wrap (thanks to the seller - Student-Seller-Umass-Amherst). As for the series, Friends is one of those television shows that you can watch again and again. The situations are so funny! I think everyone has a favorite episode. When I am down, Friens make me happy (apart from shopping, of course!)

0891419063|5.0|I have read this book twice, now have it for my kindle and the audio version.  Downright amazing! a true telling of the hell he and others went through during the war. He tells it how it was, no matter how horrifying.<br /><br />Its an easy read, and a book you can not put down till its finished. Then you have to pick up, and start reading it again.<br /><br />I know he's passed but thank you Mr. Sledge, and all veterans.

Hopefully this will recapture that experience to some degree.<br /><br />Let the pre orders begin.
0425263908|5.0|Rcvd 07/19/12 Lovely Seller, Wonderful Product, Superb Shipping! Thanks Again! I picked this up because one of the gals I watch on youtube mentioned it. I figured, I might as well pick it up and see what all the hub-bub is about with these sorts of books.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My son loves Phineas and Ferb and loves this app. Great add to Where's My Water. Definately worth the small fee.

B00701L5XS|5.0|Very nice, 3&amp; makes it a lot easier to understand what happens while tying the knot. Play spired should be slowed down a third IMO, wish it had monkey's fist (I have never green able to tie that one). This had pretty much all the knot most people would ever need to tie and I think most people could learn each knot in mere minutes.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book actually proves the existance of time travel, because I sat down to read tonight, and three hours disappeared!<br /><br />There are already thousands of reviews of this book, so I'll just say this: I loved it. It was a fascinating journey into nostalgia, into the land of what-ifs, into the crossroads of time. The ending, as with most King novels, was sweet but sad. (Although I do have one question: What happened to Jake's cat? I'm hoping he had his own good angel, and made it through okay.)<br /><br />If you love Stephen King like I do, read this book. But a word of advice: take a couple days off work, clear your schedule and don't do anything but read. (You can thank me later.)
B003L20IJM|5.0|During June, I became home bound due to a bad attack of gout.  To forget the pain and misery I ended up watching way too many movies.  I enjoyed Borne identity series and also TV reruns of Grim Brothers.  Most action movies I watched - Spiderman series and Ironman series - were very forgettable.  And I was very, very disappointed by Alice in Wonderland by Tim Burton.  But one movie did stand out and thoroughly brightened my day:  Nanny McPhee Returns.  The movie was a lot of fun and very enjoyable.  This was by far the best movie I seen among some 20-30 movies I watched in June.  Highly recommended!
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game. Glad I got it. Well worth it. Son had it first and convinced me to get it. Sometimes the kid gets one right.

B000000YNZ|5.0|This is the kind of introspective music you can enjoy alone in a dimly-lit room with your favorite single malt whisky, or in a dimly-lit room with your significant other.  There are numerous erudite reviews posted here, so I won't even pretend to sound like a musical expert, but suffice to say I have no regrets with this purchase.  I'd have to say it's my favorite of the ten Bill Evans discs (including Portrait, Everybody Digs, Village Vanguard, Conversations, Waltz, Trio 65, and Undercurrent, all great discs) I own.  The only fault I can find is the rather prominent tape hiss.  If a clean re-mastered version (hopefully with some bonus alternate takes or lost tracks) is released, I'll be buying it.
0525952616|5.0|Daniel Suarez has done it again ([[ASIN:B003L1ZXCU Daemon]], [[ASIN:0857381229 Freedom]]).  He's written the tech thriller of the year.<br /><br />He's managed to get his mind around the most complex and terrifying military technology of our time, DRONES, and turn it into a thriller that will keep on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />What is a drone and why is it terrifying? It's a flying robot that can kill with precision.  Drones are currently being used across the world from Pakistan to Yemen to the Philippines, to continuously watch and kill people.  Already, thousands of people are being killed by drones each year, and that number will rapidly grow beyond everyone's expectations.  Why?  Moore's law.  Drones are going to get very cheap and very smart much faster than anyone anticipates (in the same way cell phones and personal computers got cheap and powerful).  That means they will be many, many more of them, used very often, in a plethora of places.<br /><br />This is where Dan Suarez steps in.  He takes this lethal technology and projects it forward in a way that feels right.  Why?  He (rightly) uses myrmecology (the study of ants, think E.O. Wilson's [[ASIN:0674002350 Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition]]) as his pattern for the evolution of drone technology.<br />He then puts it into a fast paced story replete with military special operators (in SAPs), corrupt defense contractors, and lots of very creepy drones -- which combine to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />So, BUY this book.  Treat yourself to an education, a thrill, and a scare all at the same time.<br /><br />Read it before you see it in the theaters (this WILL become a movie).
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Received the product on-time and have already cut 3 bottles with it.  The directions are clear and it seems to work well, just need to practice the separation after the cut.
0345803485|1.0|After reading the negative reviews, I had resolved in my mind that I was not going to read this book because they hit on the things that I dislike in a novel.  I should have stuck to my guns! Like many others, I wanted to see what the hoopla was all about plus my sister kept urging me to read them despite my telling her that this book has everything that I hate in a story.  I purchased the entire trilogy anyway.  After getting halfway through the first book, I had had enough and forced myself to finish it.  I felt like I was reading a young adult novel with an attempt of erotica and BDSM.  As an avid reader of BDSM and erotica novels I felt that this fell way short of both elements.  I realize that this is fiction, but even fiction has some elements of realism to it, but this one did not.  It read like a fantasy book of every girls dream. There's nothing wrong with that, I just don't want it in my adult novels. I don't know why authors in general feel like they need to make the male characters filthy rich.  I do enjoy reading about luxury items in a novel, but this was overkill.  I wanted to like Ana's character but she feel flat for me. I hate a clingy, whining female character.  She made the decision to enter into this BDSM world with Christian, so she should have embraced it and not whine about it.  In the BDSM novels that I have read, no Dom would have tolerated any disobedience, and there would be no room for discussion or negotiations. The language of the novel was very simplistic which is fine, but the author would throw in some big words that didn't fit with the flow of the story.  Every time I came across a \\"big\\" word I found myself stopping because it didn't fit the flow.  I felt that the author just threw in big words to make the story seem more mature.  It didn't work for me. Also, for a BDSM/erotica novel the language was very tame. I'm not shy when it comes to reading BDSM and erotica novels so I like them to be very spicy.  I also felt that this novelwas filled with a lot of fillers and unnecessary scenes.  If all the fillers were taken out this could have been one novel.<br /><br />I don't want to tell readers not to read this book.  From the reviews, it looks like it's a hit with some and a miss with others.  For me it was a big miss for the reasons previously stated.  I should have listened to my inner self and stayed away but my curiosity got the best of me. My advice is that if you are looking to read this novel for BDSM and erotica there are better ones out there.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a great version with clean lines and all the functions I need, especially the clear all button and memory.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|What a great movie.  I watched it before I visited Mt. Rushmore.<br />And the acting was fantastic.  I know that i am going to be watching it again.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This is a great documentary, especially since Robert McNamara narrates much of it himself. It gives an inside look into how the US Government operates under stressful circumstances, and how hypocritical they can be. War is an ugly reality, and I support the US troops wholeheartedly, but there needs to be some restraint when conducting operations abroad... After watching this movie several times I've concluded that the use of the Atomic Bomb was completely unnecessary, it was simply a \\"live test\\" the US Government wanted to do. Buy the movie and decide for yourself!
B00785P2QC|4.0|the game is fun, kind of chaotic on the screen with all the goals and information, but enjoyable.  music needs help lol.  its nice you don't have to really babysit it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, particularly book 2. Had I only read the first book it might have changed my opinion. So much more happens in books 2 and 3, that by reading only the first one, you miss the whole point. Remember 3 things: 1 - THIS IS FICTION!!!! not someone's recommendation that we all explore the sexual exploits detailed in the book; 2 - To read only book 1 is like watching 1/3rd of a movie. 3 - It is a romance trilogy with graphic sexual detail. If you understand those things going in, you will probably enjoy the trilogy. The author does a good job developing the main character's relationship and how they both grow and change over time.<br /><br />However, I do agree with one other reviewer that there were some 'time' issues that the editor should have caught. All in all it was a great escape, and there were times I had trouble putting them down. I'm very glad that I read the books and I have recommended them to friends who wouldn't be put off by the graphic sexual content.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game claims. to be free but its not. because you have to spend a lot of real money to buy buildings and other items. don't dowmload!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is my favorite game.I love the snow fort.I wish the therapod was cheeper but I still like the game.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I've been a fan of Where's My Water? and this is exactly the same gameplay-wise, but it has enough new additions to make it fun and worthwhile. This is a great game and recommend you get it if you're a fan of Swampy like me.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|calculator works great. fits to the screen. I forget I'm using my kindle. big keys. easy to see. the memory feature is nice.
0345803485|5.0|When I started Fifty shades,I thought it would be one of those raunchy porno books. But because a friend kept telling me it was  a must read,Being a book alcoholic I bought the book on my Kindle and could not put it down.  The story is every women's fantasy, A fine,wealthy, mysterious, experience man schools the young,innocent Ana. I thought the character Grey was exciting, titillating and absolutely yummy and Ana was the perfect pupil ready for instruction. To E. L. James, This book was wonderfully written, I will remember it for a long time to come.  Thank you for your imagination and creativity in bringing Christian and Ana to life.  Well Done!
B00003CXC7|5.0|If you like Jimmy Stewart, you will love watching this classic movie over and over.  It is one of those movies you never tire of.  I have watched it many times and each time I catch something that I didn't notice the previous times.  Great purchase!

B006ZGDC26|5.0|This UK release has been in gestation for around 18 months and contains lots of album versions, single versions and a few promo versions, many previously unreleased on CD. The mastering is excellent: very gentle compression, so no distortion and no clipping. Thank you Harmless! This collection of the finest Philly tunes is really worth every penny, although this import box set is a bit more expensive for US customers than for European customers.<br />For those not familiar with Gamble and Huff and the PIR family of labels and artists, use this box set to study the Philadelphia International catalogue and discover the artists (Amazon offers you a vast collection of CD reissues of many PIR titles).<br />The full track listing which has been posted earlier this month is not fully correct, unfortunately. Also the extensive and well informative booklet which is included in the box set does contain some errors on the track listing. Here's the right track listing. To every song I've added the actual length and the actual year of release in the US, and determined the correct version used in this collection (album or single). Also helpful if you're looking for a specific version.<br /><br />CD 1<br /><br />01. M.F.S.B. - Zach's Fanfare #2 - Album Version 1:06 (1975)<br />02.

B003TH41H4|5.0|I was a fan from beginning to end, but my favorite is Cara!!!! I love all the character though, it is such a Great Show!!
0345803485|1.0|Stopped reading at page 45. Absolute waste of my time, money and effort. Shallow, childish, cheap erotic fantasy, virgin girl at the age of 21 meets snobby super wealthy CEO who is at the age of 27.... Shallow, shallow, shallow to the point of pain.
B0086700CM|4.0|I thought that this game is great but needs better graphics. Very good gameplay. Controls are easy to use. Any age can play this game.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|this game is so fun and mildly addicting. I would love it if they made another one anyone who contradicts is an idiot
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was recently in a rut of reading the same old genre of book before my wife talked me into reading this one.  It sucked me in so fast I didn't know what hit me.  Amazing writing, real and believable characters, an incredibly unique plot, and the perfect good vs. evil theme.  Katnis' imperfections made her character that much more real and believable.  The love triangle with Peeta and Gale made for an interesting sub-plot.  Absolutely loved every part of this book...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of variety and simple enough for young kids. enjoyment for the whole family. would recommend. for the casual game player.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|These flashback books are a nice change of pace to the \\"current day\\" Jack Reacher books.  This book had plenty of action and some good plot twists and turns.  While I love action, some of the violence and results were not quite so believable... but neither is his character.  I can't say it's the best Reacher book I've read, but I did find myself scrambling for time to read it... so it's not all bad.  Would probably give it a 3.5 star rating if I could.
B000OLX4SU|4.0|Sure this is a little dated, however the script is solid. Steph Lady and Frank Darabont do an excellent job capturing the feeling from Shelley's original masterpiece. The friendship with the professor is an interpretation that goes well with the original plot. The monster actually speaks and you can hear partial quotes from the book. While the Elizabeth arc is not the norm, it provides a good subtext to classic Victor characterization/reactions.<br /><br />I liked the late 18th century time period. It was a fresh take from the usual early 19th century interpretations.<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein is my favorite role played by Kenneth Branagh. He is passionate and believable. I liked Ian Holm's short role as Victor's father. Robert DeNiro brought a new twist to the Monster. I enjoyed his interpretation. Many reviewers claim DeNiro is \\"too short\\" for the role. To be honest, the cinematographer did such a good job lining up the shots that I as a viewer did not notice DeNiro's natural height.<br /><br />Possible spoilers about sets:<br /><br />This film is not 5 stars because of the sets. While the lab and how the monster was created were cleverly designed, the repetition of certain sets was distracting and at times confusing. (One reaction from me was--wasn't this Victor's lab? Why is it clean/looks like he never set anything up here). The most distracting set was the main hall. Any audience member can see it is a \\"set\\" not a location.<br /><br />Yes, it has a slight '90s feel in the music, coloring, and the shots. However, do not let that distract you from the film. It is one of the best film adaptations I've seen.
B001NLL8LA|2.0|I've read all of the Jack Reacher books up to this one, and this is by far my least favorite.  These books are usually fun and easy to read, the lack of action (especially in the beginning half) had me fighting to finish it.  I almost abandoned it for something else several times.  Sorry.
0345803485|2.0|I read this book after hearing how it was a must read.  I really don't get it?  Any guy that acts like a pouty brat is not attractive in my book no matter how handsome, rich etc..  I once dated a guy in college who was from a very wealthy family and handsome.  Sometimes he would actually whine and pout when he didn't get his way.  Let me tell you ladies, in real life it is not an attractive quality.  I ran for the hills.  That is why I don't get this book.  If people saw a man in person who told you what to eat, when to have sex, was a stalker they would be on Dr. Phil no matter how good the sex was.  I can't wait to see how they are going to do the movie because a guy with these qualities is such a turn off.  The other very annoying thing was the lip biting line.  Way overused to the point of naseum.  All I could think of was the girl in twilight who bit her lip and it really looked kind of stupid.  I'd rather take the vanilla sex with my sweet hubby any day over the control freak sex tale life in this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is more like Part 2 of The Hunger Games, which definitely left you wanting more and more.  The cliff hanger all but assured you'd be buying this one.  As it went on it really forced you to look at your place in the world and think what you'd do in such a desperate situation.  Obviously more twisted than the real government (at least what we can see), the capitol represents the worst of us (with some good), while the people represent the best of us.  The more I read, the more questions I had.  Just when I thought the love triangle was starting to resolve itself, everything got turned upside down.  Just when I thought I had the end figured out, the rules changed.  Very unpredictable and exciting at every corner.  Every second of my free time was spent reading this book as I sometimes stayed up into the wee hours... knowing I'd pay for it the next day.  Glad I started reading these books they were already written!
B00701L5XS|5.0|A perfect application, for the camper, survivalist, fisherman, etc.  Beautiful examples of tying some of the best knots.  Really is a five star application to me.  If you didn't learn these from your grandfather or in the scouts give this program a try - you won't be disappointed.  Very useful.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This app is awesome, and very creative but it isn't 100% adicting. I like the idea that you get a pic off of google.
1416550534|5.0|Kate Morton is definitely one of my new favorite authors.  This book moved a bit slower than the Forbidden Garden but I felt I was living every single page.  What an ending too!  Mystery and history and just a well written, well thought out story!
0060723513|5.0|A really great story, I loved the book, and so do all the many friends who have borrowed it from me.
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game.  very addictive. cant seem to stop playing .........I cant believe its free. plays great on my fire
B007JOM0GC|5.0|I love Katy Perry and the download of the whole album went very good.  It was downloaded to my cloud player and all is well.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app! I like it much better than Where's my Water. It makes me feel more into it  and involved. I recommend this game to all of the people who would like an app that is very fun and satisfying. This app is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00701L5XS|4.0|just downloaded and can explain how to do some crazy things with string.  recomend to anyone who is interested in tying knots for fun nd profit.
0345803485|3.0|I finished Fifty Shades of Grey a few days ago. I was conflicted about reading the book due to the fact that the writing is pretty bad and I had confirmed that when Matt was reading the books a few days ago.  This review will be a bit more boring than other reviews, mainly because I am not focusing on the sexual aspects of the book (which are, indeed, sorted and numerous and deserve their own novelette).  Instead, my review focusing on a simple warning:  If you have had an abusive childhood, you may want to think long and hard before reading this book.<br />The male in the book has been severely abused as a child and has developed many coping skills to handle the psychological and physical abuse he went through as a kid.  As a child who was abused, I can relate to Christian Grey's need to be in control of his environment.  I can also relate to his obsession regarding food.<br />However, from reading the reviews prior to the book, I had not expected that level of child abuse to be present.  I generally avoid books dealing with child abuse and a few other issues because I know they are a trigger for me.  This book surprised me.  I do admit to reading that Mr. Grey was \\"50 shades of F'd up\\" but that does not translate in my mind to severely abused as a child.<br />Just a warning for those who may be triggered by these issues.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|it started off good but after a while it just sink not saying i didn't enjoy reading or listening it was ok not too bad the writer could have done better just saying still
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a good variety of games and skill levels. it's hard not to almost throw the kindle across the room while playing. adults and kids will enjoy. I didn't realize the games had to be unlocked and it makes it more fun.
034580404X|5.0|This series is really, really good!  Yes, there is a lot of sexually explicit scenes but the love story is what will keep you wanting more!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|tells me when the moon will be full and at what time so I can avoid civilization for a night when i turn into a wolf beast.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|What is the fuss about? Boring , insipid girl meets sexually insane man. End of story. Not particularly well written and who cares if she signs the contract? Can't believe it is such a best seller. Reading that book is time in my life I will never get back.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game you get to build all sorts of buildings. I think you will be surprised when you play this game
B005LAIIS0|4.0|A man with nothing left to live for, all that he loves, including his faith, gone. This is what our central character faces as our movie begins. This is about what makes life worth living, and what you would fight for if death was on your doorstep and had you all but ready to surrender to it.<br /><br />An oil drilling company is the location where a bunch of forgotten men, the dregs of society, take a job no one wants in an unforgiving environment. On the way to Anchorage, the plane crashes and a handful of survivors are stranded far from civilization facing the elements, starvation and a pack of relentless wolves. The story centers around Liam Neeson, who we learn was a man hired to kill wolves threatening the drillers. As the survivors collect their bearings, it is he who takes control of this group and lends his knowledge of wolves. From here, it is a fight for survival as the group struggles to get to safety and are stalked by the wolves.<br /><br />This movie had great acting, and while it has action, it is not really an action film. It has similarities to other films such as The Edge, and Alive. If you enjoyed those movies you will enjoy this. I chalk up the bad reviews this movie got to people not liking the ending, and/or the lack of action. I personally recommend it highly.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app is okay. It passes time by. I recommend it for younger people. The graphics are pretty good. What is really annoying is the advertisements! They are a pain. It's worth downloading,I guess. :). I've had no problems.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Not as many levels as Where's My Water but still fun. Works on Kindle Fire and is definitely  worth a buck.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is not the Oregon Trail of my youth (which I loved 20+ years ago). It's so much better! I Love this type of game. Thank you :-)
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I just discovered both the movies and the books in the last 3 months, and half a dozen books and these DVDs later now I'm hooked.  However the two both hit different sweet spots for me.  The books pull strongly at different emotions from sadness, longing, despair, hope and wonder.  However the TV shows are more uplifting (the tagline is \\"hope has a warrior\\"), and I find that fits better into an hour slot which I've been watching every day after work.<br /><br />While watching these I had been likening them to Xena or Hercules, and I've since found that its no coincidence.  If you like those (but with less comedy) then I'd recommend this to you.  Similarly if you like fantasy but don't mind a plot which jumps from episode to episode then again I'd strongly recommend it.  However I wouldn't buy these just because you love the books and want to see it again in a different media, as the adaptation isn't nearly as close to the books as say Lord of the rings or Game of Thrones.<br /><br />Overall this is the first time I've been moved to write an Amazon review as this is fully worth its 5 stars.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I hate it as the levels get harder I cant do them they are<br />to hard to do so if you are six dont buy it.
B0000026UV|5.0|Amazon's music choices are always great. Mark Knopfler & Chet Atkins NECK AND NECK<br />WAS NO EXCEPTION. What a contrast of guitar styles,yet a perfect match. They compliment each other so very well. I already had this recording in cassette but not in cd format. Definitely an all time favorite.
0525478817|5.0|the short version: wow. John Green's writing is amazing and beyond any other young adult book I've read<br /> the longer video review here: [...]
B008764ZQ4|5.0|This sound track is great if you enjoy music of the 80's.  It has different songs than the Broadway soundtrack.  Tom Cruise does a nice job.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book,  I have recommended to ...everyone. Can't wait to see what the author comes up with next. Easy quick read.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|The streaming download was seamless and I was pleased to see that repeated viewings are possible.  As far as the episode goes, it has a great story line, is well acted and well directed, I will probably pursue the series.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is one of da best apps ever &#9733; &hearts; &#9834;you should get this app if u haven't totally!!! I also recomend where's my water.
B00884GR0W|2.0|it looks like a great game but when I try to download it it says there was a problem. the worst thing was that I have to pay before I can download it so I paid and it wont work. I'm hopping it will finially work so I can play.
B005HSL626|5.0|The fruit must be refrigerated first then open up. This makes the fruit cold and nice. Try mixing it up with other fruits
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and its way better than smurfs. I think this is the best game ever! stop reading the reviews and go download it now.
B003IY49S4|4.0|A wide variety of artists and styles in a great collection.Set this one up in a multi CD changer on random play for a delightful trip through the various moods of jazz.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|game is great fun except the prices of expansion increase to quickly and it seems to take forever to collect enough coins. I have had a great time collecting animals and playing the mini games.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|My cat could do this game. And &quot;Find 59 white roses&quot;? Really? Could not WAIT to finish this. Ugh. Waste of $0.99...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is a little confusing because there is so much to do.  Hang in there because it is a lot of fun!!!!
159562015X|2.0|I am thoroughly disappointed with Strength Finders 2.0. I already have \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\" and in comparison, ST2.0 seems like a cheap re-print promising a better evaluation and much more feedback. What you actually get is 95% the same explanations of the Strengths as in 1.0, plus a helpful list of 10 \\"to dos\\" for each strength, MINUS half of the 1.0 book that contained a lot of helpful information (everything from a much stronger presentation to \\"managing strengths\\" and \\"building a strengths based organization.\\"<br /><br />Maybe the \\"Finder\\" did get a lot better, but the actual content in the book diminished incredibly (oh, and by the way, you'll only get about 1 paragraph of information per Strength off the website that isn't already in the book!\\"<br /><br />HUGE potential... seems to have been lost in making more money off of new package.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Well, every woman I know is reading this trilogy, so what's a girl to do??  First and foremost, this book gives me hope: I CAN make it to the New York Times best seller list!  I just have to remove all my sensible filters and type.  Are we THAT bound??  I hope so, I desire to be rich just like Ana...dear Ana.<br /><br />That said, I don't normally skim over sex scenes, but when you've had enough, you've got to move on.  But to what?  More sex.  This is the first set of books that has cured me of wanting any more than I'm already getting.  That said, my favorite part of the book was Christian's transformation, which I felt took WAY too long, but I've never met a DOM before, so I guess that's how it goes. It is indeed a process...<br /><br />I gave the trilogy three stars since I haven't finished the last book...the number may go down.  That said, I'm on vacation where a wild great lake churns, so there's nothing to do but read, and these books do keep you reading.  They are darkness and light in some very expensive clothing. I would add that there are some great one-liners in here, where Victorian Prude meets the Prince of Darkness:  We loved Pride and Prejudice and Beauty and the Beast, so what's not to love here?<br /><br />I'll tell you.  The overdone sex.  Simply, the not-so-sexy everyplace coitus.  There's a few places left, you know: The \\"fridge,\\" the roof and Mrs. Robinson's house.  I bet that would light their collective fires, but what doesn't??  No man is this great, and no woman that beautiful.<br /><br />That said, it will get you out of your own meager life for a while, and isn't that what novels are about?  As for me, I will choose something a bit more dense next time, something that lifts me a bit higher than the surface of my grand piano.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!i love this app so much i want to be on it right now but i am too busy writing this review!!!!!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This sound track is beautiful, wonderful, fantastic.  It has rich sound and makes me feel as if I am right in the room in person. I love it.
0385341008|5.0|I honestly loved everything about this book. I thought at the start it was a little slow and maybe difficult to get into the swing of it all being written in letter form. If you give it a chance and read more than the first 20 pages you will love it. The characters and situations are all so wonderful I didn't want it to end.
0385344228|5.0|Just finished this book and not only was it well written but it introduces family dynamics, schoolboy/girl dynamics, legal dynamics and overall gives the reader something to ponder every step of the way.<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting.  Each time I thought the story was ended another chapter brought another heart rending issue.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved this game so much. I want to play it every day. but it dies after a while.I hate that.
B00701L5XS|3.0|Not too great implementation. Usually I ignore all the whining about this permission, that permission paranoia, but to have this many features that would make any data miner happy, is hard to ignore.<br /><br />Give it three stars because it's helpful as far as knots are concerned.<br /><br />People, please stop it with the paid app reasoning already. It's the faotd, you didn't PAY for it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Quick fun for any age, love it.  Have time to spend waiting for you or your children, this will keep you busy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game its a good get away game at work. I play this game to wind down after a day of work.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game helps concentration and reflexes aand patience i love it and so do my friends i never taught it would be so addictin!!!
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|One way or another, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" will not be exactly what you expect, and that's exactly what it's all about: the unexpected. As the cover notes state, it's also about international conspiracies and such, and yet another important theme regards our conceptions of sanity and lack thereof, and how the two are not always as mutually exclusive as we'd like to think. \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" entails every conceivable ingredient of a good film: a gripping plot; cinematography that gives an ultra-realistic sense of time and place; fine acting by all--the level of empathy we reach with the primary characters is exceptional; themes that challenge the mind without distracting from simple enjoyment of the story; well-earned moments of both warmth and heartbreak; a powerful ending; and the list goes on. Regardless of whether or not it's ultimately recognized as a classic film, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is one of maybe three or four out of dozens I've seen in recent years that truly deserves this label.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game! It's amazing! With Draw Something you can face your friends from facebook, your email, or even just someone random. It's a really fun game and I think you will enjoy it alot!!!
B008MEM24S|2.0|well I can probably appeal 2 evry1 when I say that THIS GAME SHUD B FREE!my parents wont let me get this app until its. free and it looks awesome!make it free then well talk
034580404X|3.0|I finally decided to read these books after multiple recommendations from friends. It's a story about love and compromise with A LOT of very \\"kinky sex\\". The plot is less then original. A standard romance novel. Young innocent girl meets older, drop-dead gorgeous, rich man. Of course, they fall in love. Of course, they have problems. Blah, blah, blah. The sex scenes are ridiculously overdone and tiresome in my opinion. I've only read the first two books and find myself often thinking \\"again?\\" or \\"oh please...\\" I have to admit that it bothers me to think of young inexperienced girls reading these books and how it might influence their view of healthy sexual relationships.<br /><br />That being said, the story kept me engaged and I found myself downloading book two despite my annoyance. I'm not sure that I'm interested in Book 3.... It bothers me that these books are at the top of the charts and I hate to contribute to that by buying them. In my opinion, they don't deserve it, despite the mildly entertaining storyline. These books are all about the kinky stuff. I can't honestly recommend them, especially for young women and girls without any sexual experience.
B0061S073A|5.0|Works really well. I can let my three year old grandson play in the car and he can't accidently exit them.
B00881VLCE|4.0|fun game to do for waiting for appointments and such.  I take turns putting puzzles together with my daughter and son
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My son and I love to play Ice Age Village together. It is easy to earn coins and acorns. We highly recommend this game.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|One of my 5th gr. students had this book with her and the cover caught my attention. I'm always looking for something different. My student said she really liked the book. A couple of months later I downloaded the book after finishing the Hunger Games trilogy.<br /><br />I absolutely enjoyed the plot and the characters of Peculiar Children. I like how the author incorporated vintage photographs into the story. Riggs has a good writing style and the story is told in first person. The story will appeal to a wide age range. Parents, there is some adult language in the book. There is some violence, but its not gratuitous. The story should make a great movie and I look forward to the sequel.<br /><br />I recommend the book to anyone teenage and above.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Great source for NEWS that the ABC, NBC, MSNBC and CBS will not report that the public should know about.  I rank them right up there with Fox News..truth you can use.  Call me conservative and so be it.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Just the week before this album made its first digital release, I was complaining to my friends about how its almost impossible to find NEW quality R&B.  That the only way you'd be able to listen to new good songs were if you knew about Frank Ocean, Cocaine 80s, and had Raheem Devaughn's latest mixtape.<br /><br />Right after that Frank Ocean drops this masterpiece and inspires hope in my heart for the future of R&B.<br /><br />Its soulful.<br /><br />The lyrics are romantic.<br /><br />He's a young guy but he's keeping it grown and sexy.<br /><br />His singing ability is phenomenal.<br /><br />The production is of top quality and the beats are very sophisticated.<br /><br />When he wants you to feel love, you will feel it.  When he wants you to feel hope, you will feel it.  When he wants you to feel dispair, you will feel it.  But by the end of it all, you will just feel happy you took this emotional roller coaster.<br /><br />Its been a very long time since you could feel a new R&B artist's heart beat through his music.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|Really liked this album from the get go and have been listening to it ever since I received my copy on June 9thh, a few days before I went to see them at the Fox in Oakland. Sure there are a couple of tracks I could do without ever hearing again, but I can barely think of an album where that is not true. And on this album there are several tracks that I REALLY enjoy--Baby Come Home, Inevitable, Only the Horses, Year Of Living Dangerously, Let's Have a Kiki, and Somewhere. Shady Love also has it's moments (but does seems a tad forced style wise, especially at the beginning...). But all in all and great stuff, great addition to the SS canon!!

B00000FCBC|5.0|A great package here. Two discs that cover many of the influences of one of greatest groups ever. The playing and singing is excellent. Some of their best. Strong and inspiring.<br /><br />The booklet that comes with this package with notes by David Fricke, goes a long way in explaining the history of this group. Love it. This is one big salute to other artists that have meant so much to Metallica and they show their appreciation and respect by playing and singing their best. These guys are artists, not just headbangers. Unlike many other metal groups, they are versatile and can explore other territory. That's something that many of their fans and critics can't or won't accept. Just take a look at the reviews of the Black Album, St. Anger or Lulu.  Some of this album outshines the originals. They do a terrific version of Nick Cave's \\"Loverman\\" and Thin Lizzy's \\"Whiskey in a Jar\\", Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Astronomy\\". All great renditions and more....<br /><br />Everybody grows up and matures......if not, they're dead or might as well be. This band has definitely grown and matured. These guys are glad to be alive and thankful for the success and opportunity to express their art. They are respectful to all the artists and musicians that have come before. They are proud and they have a right to be. They have produced some of the best hard/heavy/rock/art... ever......by anybody.<br /><br />If you like and respect Metallica, you probably will like this one....

B001RNO7AS|5.0|Loving these shoes! Perfect fit, and I took the advice of fellow reviewers for that.Order half a size big. Looks great with denims too.<br /><br />Shoes look great, both with casuals and formals. I think they will hold up well on treks too.<br /><br />Final word: kudos to Amazon for the superb shipping. Received the shoes in India within 6 days! Wow and thanks!
0345803485|1.0|Please, do not waste your money. If you know someone that has the books (and I'm sure we all do), save yourself a few dollars and borrow theirs. Chances are, they were probably just going to throw their copies away anyway. All 3 books are exactly as the other reviewers describe them:<br />Juvenile, poorly written and repetitive.<br />It's almost as if the author is playing a joke on us and decided to write the same phrases over and over to see if anyone noticed... My breath hitched, I bit my lip and I got so sick of the character Anna questioning whether Christian really loved her, it made me wonder whether the author had self-esteem issues or if she actually thinks women act like that. Either way, it was super annoying!<br />They were a complete waste of my time and money. Find an author who writes something worth reading and save yourself the money. These certainly can't be considered erotica. After the first scene, I found myself skipping over the others because they were so repetitive, felt like they were written by someone very inexperienced and not worth reading.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I rarely give reviews let alone a 5 star one. But I must give praise where praise is due, and Suzanne Collins is worthy of a 5 star rating with this book of the trilogy. I can sum up the book with one word: EXPLOSIVE. Never have I ever been transported to such a place in my imagination. The world she created is so unique and original but she really took me there. The angst and suffering that these characters endure is so gripping. I literally had to keep going to find out what could possibly happen next. The conclusion is EPIC, even more so than the first book. You cannot even begin to guess what's going on or how on earth these characters are gonna make it. I could go on and on. Thank you,  Ms. Collins for giving such an amazing story. By far one of the best books I have ever read.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The most important thing I can tell anyone that reads this review is that IF you are familiar with BDSM relationships, wish to be in one or are curious as to what they are REALLY like then DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.<br /><br />This is not a series about a couple that gets into BDSM. It is a series of books to show women they can change a man into what they want. Even if what they want is extreme as bondage. Not that the bondage is all that extreme, rather dull by my standards.<br /><br />She mocks him, humiliates him and makes a joke out of the entire BDSM lifestyle.<br /><br />I will give you 1 example and you will see my point. In the story they go to a topless beach. She asked to take her top off too, he said NO. She waits till he went into the water and took her top off anyways. ANY BDSM person knows that she would be punished for defying what he said so openly. Her punishment?  Why that would be SEX with handcuffs on???  Excuse me? you give her more sex?<br /><br />So, if you are a lonely housewife that wishes she could CHANGE her husband into what you wanted to marry in the first place the buy this book... everyone else, RUN!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|After seeing the \\"trailer\\" for Wool on Gizmodo the other day, I figured I would give the book a try. Needless to say I read the entire Omnibus in two days. Wool is without question one of the best sci-fi stories (if not one of the best stories PERIOD), I've ever read. There is no doubt in my mind that this will go on to be one of the greats.<br /><br />I also hope that Ridley Scott and company don't ruin this when they make it a movie. This story has the potential to rival or exceed any of the other major sci-fi series, if they do it correctly.<br /><br />READ WOOL NOW!
B0086700CM|5.0|I like the game. you get frustrated with it but it is so addictive. it is so fun to play.
B0047VSW30|4.0|You know, it's factual that the Alexandrian library was destroyed several times, historically.  And as a proponent of logic and reason it's been a pet peeve of mine that knowledge and wisdom of the previous cultures were despised, whether for monetary gain or out of religious zeal.  I don't really know whether the Bishop Cyril was anywhere as political or violent as the character who incites violence in this film.<br /><br />Alas, these violent episodes were concurrent with the suppression of Arian Christianity, concurrent with the poisoning of Arius, when a Roman emperor Theodosius dictated the doctrine of the Christian church for the tangible political motive of preventing civil war.<br /><br />Whatever shortcomings are inherent to this fictional, historical drama, it's portrayal of the influences of theocratic rule are not sugar coated.  That slave who becomes a Christian in this drama is swept up in the fervor of other antagonists.  His own passions are manipulated painfully against him, for the selfish political aims of a cleric.  Art is entwined in the love and the horror.
B008MEM24S|5.0|great game! works very well on the kindle fire. I love where's my Perry its almost better than where's my water &lt;3
B005ES1DW2|3.0|I thought these Crocs would be great given the base of the shoe is well made/higher base. However, kind of clumsey to walk in and does not have the nubs on the inside that the original crocs have.  Try to look at them at a store or try them on before you purchase on Amazon.  Amazon still has the best price around. Great color combo..better than picture shows.  If you have worn crocs in the past suggest you compare with the original Crocs!
0345803485|5.0|Don't believe any negative reviews, this trilogy is a hot summer read. Its an escape from all that is stressful in a woman's life. The author created characters that women secretly dream about--uber protective alpha male, fairy tale romance, the security of wealth, tortured male in need of nurturing, and the essential...LEG CLENCHING SEX. No boring missionary nonsense in this read. Enjoy this book for exactly what it is AN EROTIC VACATION.
1455508977|5.0|Nicholas Sparks captures your attention from the first to last page. I really liked this story. It will tug on your heartstrings, and question your belief in the power of fate or destiny. I could relate to all the characters in this story, spending more than half my life around the Military- ah- the mannerism. I even had my own \\"Zeus\\", so made this story even more special to me. I have to say, I really liked Nana and all her quirky little sayings. All the characters are authentic, N.S. will not disappoint you with this read.
B007QEHQY6|5.0|Cons: Like any compilation set like this, the recordings are going to be of variable quality.  For instance if you're buying this set mainly for the Planets, I would not recommend it.  There are other recordings better than the one on this disc.  And unfortunately, they did omit some rather nice Holst works, such as the Double Concerto, Two Songs Without Words, Fugal Overture, Lyric Movement, The Cloud Messenger and the posthumous Capriccio.  It's hard to see how works like that don't make it while some others do, unless perhaps those aforementioned works just don't exist in the EMI catalog.  (As an example, Holst's most successful opera was Sivitri.  That's not included while they include two of lesser quality and renown.)<br />Pros: While there are some inexplicable omissions, it more than makes up for it with what it does contain.  This set contains a lot of nice works that have not been frequently recorded (Beni Mora, Ode to Death, Dirge for two Veterans, Hammersmith (original version) to just name a few).  To be able to amass such a number of rare works in one fell swoop for such a bargain price more than makes up for the downsides.  It's handsomely packaged and as mentioned it's an absolute bargain, therefore I give it five stars!
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|This new album is diffrent from hybrid..meteora..and minutes to midnite.it is closer to sounding like thousand suns but better than that.they took out the dialouges and intros and the album flows better.the power chords are gone too  and have been replaced by an electronica sound....sorry old schoolers...but the album is ok maybe one day theyll go back to their roots...but not on this album. its not bad.

B0063GORYU|5.0|It's missing the winning deal like on their other card games and oddly enough on the iPad??! Also, the tap and auto move is horrible on where to move cards, usually a bad move that I have to correct.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have finished reading the first book and am currently halfway through reading the second, and I am not sure I'm going to finish it or read the third.  As far as the first book goes, I was intrigued by the original sex scene and wanted to know what would happen with their \\"relationship\\".  Unfortunately, I am getting quite bored with the \\"plot\\" (if you can call it one).  The two main characters only ever fight and then have make up sex.  In between the repetition of the blushing naive girl and her overwhelming ability to ask stupid questions and question their \\"relationship\\" gets pretty old.  Not only is the plot severely lacking, the smut aspect is not at all what the reviews and talk has led me to expect.  It is also a poorly written book that I would be unlikely to recommend that anybody waste their time reading.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I did a one-day rim-to-rim hike in the Grand Canyon, and it injured one of my knees.  I met with an orthopedic surgeon, had an MRI, did physical therapy for a while, and I still haven't been able to run much because inclines re-injure my knee.  Too bad, because I love races, and before the Grand Canyon I'd done a 1/2 marathon and wanted to do a full marathon and then who knows what.  So, when a running blog that I follow started talking about barefoot running, it captured my attention.  It made sense that landing differently on my feet may change things.  So, I bought myself some Soft Star Moc3s, and I've been continuing to follow any news or information that I find on barefoot or minimalist running.<br /><br />A couple weeks ago I heard the author of this book on a local radio show.  He was talking about barefoot running and taking calls from listeners.  I'd heard of his book before, but I didn't remember anything about it.  I was so impressed with the radio program that I decided to read his book.  I ordered it through the Kindle app on my phone, and read it within a few days.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't really care for the book at the beginning.  Now that I'm on a computer, I see that the description of the book talks a bunch about the Tarahumara, so other readers will have a better idea of what they're in for, but from my phone I didn't see any of that description.  Instead, I just kept wondering when we were going to get to the point!  The book seemed very slow moving at first, and I felt like the author could have combined the first five chapters or so into one chapter.<br /><br />I especially liked a few of the chapters that were more like typical non-fiction: there was a chapter about shoe manufacturers, and a chapter about anthropology...that was more of what I was expecting, and I liked that stuff better.<br /><br />As for the main storyline, I found it somewhat dramatic.  The author makes everything sound so extreme, which to me made the book feel like fiction instead of non-fiction. However, I felt like things picked up partway through the book, and it got more interesting.  Thinking about the beginning of the book, though, the author goes to great lengths to talk about how invisible the Tarahumara are, and how elusive they are, but then he's at one of their schools hanging out with their kids...how elusive are they if you can just show up at one of their schools?  Or there is all this dramatic stuff about meeting Caballo Blanco, and expecting him to run off...but...why would that even happen?  I don't know.  I just thought that was kind of weird and extreme, and a little over editorialized, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Still, towards the end of the book, I could hardly put it down.  I felt like I knew the people that were in the book because the author really brings them to life.<br /><br />After I finished the book, I visited the author's website, and (!!!) he has pictures.  I don't know if the physical book has pictures, or not, but the Kindle version on my phone didn't, so if you decide to read the Kindle version, I recommend checking out the author's website and/or Google Images to see pictures.  That really brought things to life for me.<br /><br />When I was looking at pictures, I found out that one of the main characters--Caballo Blanco died earlier this year, and that made me teary.<br /><br />So, anyhow, this is pretty good book.  I recommend this book to anyone interested in barefoot or minimalist running.  Just, expect that it is in the context of a story, and then it won't feel as rambling as it did for me.fiction instead of non-fiction.

B005K17RU0|1.0|Worked great for about two minutes, then locked up on my Kindle Fire.  Had to hard start to resolve issue.
B0084IG7KC|1.0|This is yet another sad movie being sensationalized to influence the children. Clearly some of these \\"reviews\\" are paid for. One of the glaringly obvious truths about the presentation of this tired storyline is that it falls in the same category as the Harry Potter, Twilight, and Game of Thrones as a media push by multiple sources, and that it's not truly entertaining.<br /><br />Another is that I've read this book and seen this movie before, twice actually. Suzanne Collins is an \\"author-screenwriter\\" so I'm postulating that she seized the opportunity to \\"double dip\\" in profits as motivation for re-writing this storyline.<br /><br />The first was a novel written by Stephen King under the pseudonym Richard Bachman titled The Running Man in 1982. This story was adapted, poorly as it was, to a movie of the same title in 1987.<br /><br />The second was a movie entitled \\"Surviving the Game\\" in 1994, featuring \\"actors\\" such as Rutger Hauer, and Ice-T. This movie was presented better than the first of this story line in visual form.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this story of the strong treading on the weak, the rich and privileged using others as they would please, with and underdog twist has been presented already, to death. It seems that there is not a single NEW idea in the entire entertainment-film making business.<br /><br />Next!!!!!

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn knows how to take you gently by the hand and then heave you over the precipice.  Often I thought I had this story figured out, only to have it twist and turn and leave me fooled right up to the very end.  \\"Gone Girl\\" will have you up all night reading until your eyes smart.  Have a bottle of Visine handy, you will need it.<br /><br />As in Ms. Flynn's previous two novels, the main characters in this one, husband and wife, Nick and Amy Dunne have secrets.  The story is told in real time from the viewpoint of Nick and through the diary of Amy.  I don't want to give away anything that happens beyond the first section of the book as this would spoil it for new readers, but be forewarned that when you've finished the book you might want to turn back to page one to start it all over again.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Simply put, this is the best album Rush has released in 30 years! I think \\"Clockwork Angels\\" has to be mentioned along with \\"2112\\" and \\"Moving Pictures\\" as one of the best Rush albums ever.
B0034G4P94|4.0|Overall, this is a great movie because it reaches in to your heart and grabs you like a vice. This movie, is what most movies aspire to be, but never make it, despite their multi-million dollar budgets and leading stars.<br />I was recommended this movie, by another Amazon reviewer, who had suggested this was better than \\"The Fighter\\" (I was looking at seeing that movie). The reviewer gave this movie high marks, and said it was worth a few. Boy, they weren't kidding. Knocked my socks off!<br />The story follows two men, who live in very different worlds, when they decide to enter the same contest for a cash prize (with very different reasons for doing it). Turns out the guys are brothers, with a broken relationship.<br />First, the things I didn't like. The beginning, the first 1/3, was slow in parts, bad pacing and development of the story.<br />Now, the things I did like. I fracking loved the gritty feel, the camera work, the directing. I loved that they didn't have a bunch of \\"big names\\" (I mean who wants to deal with having to sort Skittles and \\"back end\\" promises). I loved the actors, they did a great job. And the last 1/3 was phenom! Seriously.<br />The Director, also co-wrote it, partially his idea, and co-produced it. I give him big Kudos! Well done! I hope the Hollywood system doesn't ruin him (like it has with a bunch of other talented people) and hope he stays true to himself.<br />I would not only buy this, I would watch this movie, over and over again.<br />It's a rare to watch a movie that leaves you feeling like you can conquer the world!

B007X4ECLY|4.0|Guy Pearce has the charisma to carry almost any movie.  B-grade sci-fi adventure set aboard an orbiting prison?  Sure, why not?  Indeed, LOCKOUT is a thoroughly enjoyable romp, and it's almost entirely because of Guy Pearce's wisecracking machismo.  It's a role that's borrowed from countless films before it; and like the best of those, it comes across as completely authentic, lending a likability to a film that doesn't have a whole lot else to offer that's new or refreshing.<br /><br />The plot is simple: the president's daughter (Maggie Grace, going beyond the damsel-in-distress stereotype) gets caught aboard said orbiting prison right before a massive prison riot.  Our hero--named simply Snow--is given a choice: go to prison for life, or rescue the First Daughter.  Snow's motivations for accepting the mission are ambiguous at first, but away he goes, to face off against a pair of evil brothers (Vincent Regan and Joseph Gilgun).  Of course, there are complications: the prison is basically falling out of the sky, meaning, unless the Eastern Seaboard is to become one giant burning graveyard, the structure will have to be blown apart...with or without Snow and his ward aboard.<br /><br />The special effects aren't the greatest; they go from impressive to video game quality fairly quickly.  The action is quick and intense; much of it is meaningless, but that should be expected.  Gilgun's unpredictably psychotic Hydell is a nice change of pace from the normal mastermind villain (represented here by a stony Regan).  Peter Stormare gives a nicely ambiguous turn as a government agent.  But again, the heart here is Pearce, who rocks through the action sequences, quips a one-liner that is genuinely amusing, shoots another bad guy, and ultimately saves the day and the girl (though the girl is capable of saving herself, thank you very much).  LOCKOUT isn't the greatest sci-fi/action B movie ever made, but it's certainly one that'll pop up on cable every now and then, and if you happen to tune in, you won't be able to help but watch it again.u happen to tune in, you won't be able to help but watch it again.

0812992792|5.0|This is one of the best books I have EVER read. A terrifying portrait of life in North Korea, but also one of the best love stories ever written, The Orphan Master's Son is fantastic. I had to stop reading it at night because the horrors of the book would linger and I often woke feeling an impending sense of doom, much like is portrayed in the book. There is always the reality that you are never safe, that everything can be taken from you at any minute, and that horrible things, unimaginable things, can and will happen.<br />In the midst of tremendous hardship, there can also be tremendous courage. One brave act can lead to another and even in North Korea you can change the course of your life for the better, even if you have to take drastic measures. I loved this book and I think of it often.

B008JH5CVS|3.0|So, two of the other reviews struck me.  One said closer to a 2 than a 4, and I have to agree - not ready to give it a 2 star \\"Didn't Like\\", but feel unsatisfied giving it a 3 star \\"OK\\".  The acting was ok - actually liked Maggie Grace, a lot - a cut above your average damsel in distress.  As far as Guy Pierce's Snow, another review said they were reminded of Jack Burton from Big Trouble in Little China, but whereas Kurt Russell was playing something of a blow hard in that film, Snow in this film is more like a Bruce Willis Character (I'm thinking more Joe Hallenbeck from the Last Boy Scout,  than John McLane) ...  although this felt a bit more of a caricature than a character.  Or maybe Bruce Willis is better at acting hurt as he is cracking wise while having the crap beat out of him.  Getting hit in the face like that messes you up, and to have an \\"Oh-Come-On\\" moment come so early in the film sets a bad tone.<br /><br />I am surprised no one saw the resemblance to another  Kurt Russell movie - Escape from New York.  Pretty sure the writers have seen that one.  Now THAT movie is looking a little old these days, and could do with a re-boot, and when I saw this I was seriously expecting that.<br /><br />Now ... Spoilers ...<br /><br />... here is where I have a problem with the film.  Snow is still working a case he was helping a friend with, even though it crashed and burned resulting the friend dying and Snow being charged with his murder.  In fact there is something strange about his arrest in that it is pretty apparent that he is being framed, but by who?  He agrees to rescue Emilie, the President's daughter, so that he can look for his partner who has been locked up on the space station for shooting a police officer after stashing some important evidence - but we don't know evidence of what.  Emilie is looking into corporate corruption and experimentation on humans in the space prison, and during the romp through the bowls of the prison they find pretty firm proof that is exactly what is going on.  They get off the station before it is blown up (did I mention that it was falling towards the eastern seaboard of the United States?  So somehow the last 15 minutes of Star Wars is played out in the movie with fighters attacking the prison and being shot down by automated gun turrets as they try to land a time bomb at a critical location on its surface ... guided missiles and smart bombs are too old fashioned in the near future I guess), and upon landing Snow is cuffed and thrown into jail .... I am not sure why the President didn't pardon him for saving his daughter, but that isn't a major problem ... what bugs me is that Emilie finds the case that Snow was looking for, but its empty - and Snow tricks the traitor into revealing himself.  \\"Did they pay you well?\\"  he asks (WHO????  Who is they????) ..... and then some pointless dialog  ... the girl catches up to him ... some more dialog and the credits.  Oh, and he finds a chip in the dead friends lighter which could have all sorts of information on it ... or porn - we will never know, cause the writers couldn't be bothered with the simple task of tying up the loose ends.<br /><br />It was sloppy.  They could have tied all the story lines together with 2 or three more lines of dialog and provided resolution to everything, say maybe chip turns out to hold information on the corrupt corporation that runs the prison - that's what Snows friend was working on and what the traitor was being paid to bury - then Emilie could finish what she was working for ... but no - they couldn't be bothered .... this slacking off on story while throwing in gratuitous special effects bugs the heck out of me.<br /><br />Pffft.  Oh well, maybe someone will bring Snake Plisskin back.of that is exactly what is going on.

B000URWYTS|4.0|I am an avid Frank Lloyd Wright enthusiast. I even have 2 Hiroshige prints.  I have always imagined 1 of them may have come to the U.S. via Frank. Having visited Taliesan, Taliesan West, Kentuck Knob, Falling Water, his home & studio in Oak Park, took the walking tour of the renovated Oak Park homes he worked on, the Robe house, had dinner in the Wright Room at the Biltmore in Phoenix & toured many homes in Usonia, Pleasantville, NY has not satisfied my urge to know more about this creative genius, years ahead of any architect of his day.  Genius, yes, but scoundrel, yes.  While I admire his designs, I know about his faults, too.  This book presents both sides of Frank, but for the first time he has been humanized by Mamah.  I never knew anything about her except her sad end.  Now I feel I know them both - bringing out the best and worst in each other.  Life would have been different for both of them, certainly less tragic had they lived a century later than they did. Details of his life have been woven together masterfully into this story.  All the facts have come together for me and will for you if you, too, are a fan.  Read and enjoy!
0307716546|4.0|I read Lupton's Sister because I am a big fan of sister stories but I wasn't as interested in this one since I saw it did not have sisters at the heart of it. But when I had the chance to review a copy through Amazon Vine, I accepted it with interest.<br /><br />Although it's been a while since I read Sister, I thought the writing style was pretty comparable and indicates that Lupton has her own distinctive voice that should serve her well as she continues to write. The story for this one also has a mystery: who started the fire at a school that led to Grace and her daughter Jenny being badly injured? And while they are having out of body experiences now, will they survive? It might be a bit hard to wrap your head around the fact that Grace and Jenny's souls are moving around but I've read weird premises so I was able to just go with it. I thought it was pretty cool actually. But my favorite part was definitely trying to unravel the mystery as several stories come together and then need to be taken apart to get to the truth.<br /><br />However there were a some aspects I really didn't like. First is the jarring use of second-person perspective. Grace uses \\"you\\" to talk to her husband but I kept feeling like she was trying to talk to the reader so I would get confused about who was doing and saying what. I think second-person is very difficult to incorporate into a novel and I don't think this one was very well-done. When the culprit is eventually revealed, I confess I was a bit confused. I think part of that stems back to the use of second-person narration. And in-between the mystery parts, there were Grace's musings on motherhood, family relations, and the relationship between mother/daughter especially. I didn't always agree with her, particularly about the last one so the fact that she treated those statements as universal didn't seat well with me.<br /><br />Overall: I think the second-person narration makes this a more divisive book than Sister but recommended to fans of more literary fiction as well as Lupton fans who will want to see this author develop her writing.<br /><br />Cover: I like the slide on a playground as there is an incident that is important but I think I would have liked to see a cover with the school on fire, just for comparison.to fans of more literary fiction as well as Lupton fans who will want to see this author develop her writing.<br /><br />Cover: I like the slide on a playground as there is an incident that is important but I think I would have liked to see a cover with the school on fire, just for comparison.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said already. This book should have been listed under humor because it was pure comdey that a grown woman would write such crap and try to past it off as erotica. I mean seriously? I thought I was reading the diary of a teenager at times. Ana was annoying to high h*ll and Christian was a pompous a-hole with Mommy issues. I personally love British romance novels and maybe that's what she should have stuck with (who in Washington St using a pram and when was the last time did someone magic a smile to their face?.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have grown up in the company of dogs.  As a child they were just playmates.  When I got my 1st dog as an adult the relationship changed.  I have trained 4 dogs of my own now.  With each dog the training became more extensive.  With each dog I learned more about their behavior, their capacity to learn, &, more importantly, about THEIR capacity to teach humans.  When I began reading this book I wasn't sure I would make it beyond the 1st few pages: for the outcome is never in question right from the start.  But this is one of those \\"you can't put it down\\" books.  Does the author know something the rest of us don't?  You get the impression he was taking dictation from the dog simply because the dog was unable to write it himself.  Now, every time my dog looks at me, I wonder what he is trying to tell me.  I'm convinced it isn't the dog who can't communicate.  It is my inability to understand canine that is the issue.

B0070UFMOW|3.0|Update - after some advice from another Amazon user and some experimentation.<br /><br />I needed to change the default output of my MAC to see the higher sample/bit rates but can see 96/24bit now - see the replies to this post.  I still can't tell for sure if this device is providing significantly better audio but that's half the fun - no?  I'll continue to experiment.<br /><br />I still only gave it three stars due to the COMPLETE lack of technical support available.  Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way but it seems to me that a device such as this demands more than a little teeny paper fold-out to allow users to get the maximum benefit.  Another option would be to create a moderated forum and hire an English/Chinese translator to respond to customer questions.  If you're taking US dollars you just have to provide support in English and if you're making devices as technically oriented as this, you just have to open the door for questions.<br /><br />*****First review********<br />I like to create a review with a first impression and then, if I resolve the issue or learn that I've made a mistake, update it later.  I'm hoping that will be the case here.<br /><br />So far this thing isn't doing anything for me past simple amplification.  It has a neat little display that shows the \\"form of input digital audio\\".  It says 48K 16bit no matter what I put into it.  I've used the audio (aux) jack from my ipod output and wasn't surprised at this sample rate.  Then I used the spdif input, with the little adaptors, to an optical cable and into my Macbook Pro (same adaptor on that end), and played a FLAC file that has MUCH higher bit rate but received the same result on the input display.  Then, just to be sure, I went to HD tracks and tried several of their high sample/bit rate samples - same input sample and bit rate shows on the E17.<br /><br />I know the objective is sound quality, so I've listened to all this same music through the SPDIF/Optical setup and from the Ipod output jack, and the Macbook Pro output jack, using some pretty good Sennheiser headphones and, past the ability to amplify, can't hear a difference.<br /><br />The real disappointment is that there is NO tech support.  Go to FIIO's support page, and the \\"contact us\\" tab just gives you links to FAQs, downloads, places to buy their products and the ability to subscribe to their newsletter.  Shouldn't be called \\"Contact us\\" because you can't.<br /><br />I know this is a Chinese company and that language is a problem but they've got to improve their support capability.<br /><br />It's a slick looking little thing and (especially after reading other reviews) it would be easy to tell myself that it was really doing something, but it's not - so far.<br /><br />Please - somebody tell me where I'm screwing up - I really want to like this thing.

1469984202|5.0|I must admit to being very sad that I have finished WOOL. Hugh Howey's unique addition to the post-apocalyptic science fiction genre is an incredibly well written and very human story. Fans of science fiction will thoroughly enjoy it, and I believe it is a great stepping stone into the genre for the unfamiliar reader.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, the plot revolves around the lives of men and women who live in a giant silo underground in a world where going outside means certain death. People have managed to create a life for themselves -- subsisting off of the food they grow, working in one of the many professions available, and following the rules of their society. If children are desired, would-be parents can enter a lottery for their chance of winning \\"permission\\" to conceive. If a crime is committed, the ultimate punishment is death by \\"cleaning.\\" To clean is to be sent outside the silo to clean the windows that are dirtied by the toxic and harsh environment of the world outside. No one who has ever been sent to cleaning has failed to clean the windows of the silo. The job is always done, and no one ever survives a cleaning.<br /><br />We meet the main character of Juliette after she has been made sheriff of the silo. She's intelligent and strong, which turns out to be a dangerous combination for her. She learns of some shadowy business involving cleaning which leads her to take action, and could possibly mean revolution for the men and women of the silo.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent story. I believe it was originally released in separate books: Wool 1, Wool 2...etc. Wool 1 and 2 read like intense short stories -- you'll be finished before you know it. Wool 3 -5 get successively longer, and contain the bulk of the action.<br />This Omnibus Edition contains all 5 parts, which is a relief (the wait between stories would have been too much for me). The parts lead right into one another, allowing the author to weave the reader through different characters and parts of the silo seamlessly.<br /><br />The characters are easily identified with: their heartbreak, resilience, fears, and love are all deeply personal human experiences that we all share. The action sequences are quick and intense, and you may find yourself having to take a break for a few seconds to reconvene your senses before moving on. I couldn't help wondering what I would do in certain situations, and it's been a while since a book has made me ask those questions. I cannot wait for Part 6!<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for all readers. This story will endear itself to both fans and newcomers to the genre. It's capable of pleasing all -- from fans of Phillip K. Dick to Zombie Apocalypse survival lovers. Even the new Hunger Games crowd of younger readers could enjoy it. This ability to appeal to multiple generations and interests could be Hugh Howey's most surprising achievement with this story.<br /><br />As for me, I'm officially a fan! This book and author will be two of my recommendations for a long time. In the meantime, I'll be diving into Hugh Howey's Molly Fyde series while I wait for Wool 6.<br /><br />Read this book, you won't regret it!nt characters and parts of the silo seamlessly.<br /><br />The characters are easily identified with: their heartbreak, resilience, fears, and love are all deeply personal human experiences that we all share.

B000007638|5.0|Back in 1976 , The band Paul McCartney and WINGS , did a  video called \\" ROCK SHOW \\", this is parts of the tour they did back then. Its one of the best \\" live rock CD/ LP ever made . McCartney voice was at its best . The songs are played excellent. The bummer is , that this \\"masterpiece \\" was never re-issued an only a very few CD's are out there that arent used . Unless you want to download it , but I heard ppl say that its not as good as a \\"CD \\" would sound . So dig deep into your pocket for a used CD or LP floating around . A rumer is , that they are going to \\"re-master the film \\" ROCK SHOW \\"  for DVD in 2013 . That would be awesome for fans , and many who hasnt seen this band . The original WINGS ,band was the great . After some bad experences that broke up the band , and Paul toured with just wife an a new group  just known as just Paul McCarney ,,,,no WINGS . . As a fan I just purchesed a copy of Wings OVER America on CD , AMAZON is about the only place i buy my music any more , or just about anything including movies . So if Rock SHOW does , come out on DVD , I most likely will buy it here .

The alien army seemed numerous but nothing an army with, I don't know, guns could have stopped. I guess I just wanted more. Fun movie that I will buy on DVD, but  way overrated. the dark knight rises made the avengers look like a saturday morning cartoon. there is nothing new in the avengers. the dark knight rises is the best superhero movie ever made.
0545265355|5.0|I began reading THE HUNGER GAMES on Tuesday morning it is now Thursday morning and I have just finished reading MOCKINGJAY. I am in my 50s and in my life I must have read thousands of books and I am not exaggerating when I say I could not put these books down until I had read all three!!  The books are very well written and fast paced.  Yes, they are written for a younger audience but still very enjoyable for a more mature reader. I plan on keeping these books so they are available for my grandchildren when they are older; they are now 3 and 5 years old.  I believe that these books will stand the test of time and in a few years will be considered classical novels on the same level as THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER or THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN!!
B004FQX59I|5.0|Regardless of subject matter, this movie is one of the greatest American films ever made.  Terrific casting. A script that pulls you in. Amazing John Williams score. Mind blowing editing. Great camera work and lighting. Wonderful performances. As far as the ideas and theories put forth, some are farout, some are entirely wrong, but should the smoke ever clear I think Mr Stone will come pretty damn close.
0307730697|5.0|We all need heroes in this world. We need people who we can look up to and emulate. We need people with integrity, honor, humility, strong faith and belief in the Living God, Jesus Christ. Someone who loves God, Country and Family more than they love themselves.<br /><br />Adam Brown was just one of those heroes. He was a strong military team member of the SEAL Team Six. His life before becoming a SEAL wasn't perfect. He had many flaws. But the one thing he did have was an inner drive that wouldn't quit. He didn't believe in quitting.<br /><br />I was so encouraged reading about Adam Brown and his life. So many times I was brought to tears over his struggles as he became one of the top SEAL Team members. I laughed over his various antics and crazy stunts he would pull. And my heart went out to and broke over the various lives he touched in such humble ways.<br /><br />Eric Blehm's style of writing is alive and impacting. Reading Fearless, was almost like reading a novel, easy to read, smooth, and riveting. I couldn't stop reading it, even though I knew what would eventually happen to Adam. Blehm kept me glued to the book because he knew there was more to Adam's story than his bravery in the face of danger.<br /><br />Fearless is the incredible story about an incredible man who would tell you, if he were here, that his wife and his brothers were the hereos, he was just doing what he believed he was suppose to do.<br /><br />This e-book review copy was provided to me free of charge for the purpose of reviewing by Blogging for Books.

B007JCP8FE|4.0|I like this album much better than their last, but it's in the same radio-friendly pop music vein as before, which is really disappointing. Still, I think the lyrics and the music is more polished and less cheesy this time around than on Sound of Madness.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Shinedown since the beginning so this is particularly disappointing to me to see their music becoming so commercialized and basically a clone of Nickelback. Ever since Jasin and Brad left, the band has gone downhill.<br /><br />1. Adrenaline - 4/5<br />2. Bully - 5/5<br />3. Amaryllis - 4/5<br />4. Unity - 5/5<br />5. Enemies - 3/3<br />6. I'm Not All Right - 3/5<br />7. Nowhere Kids - 4/5<br />8. Miracle - 2/5 (This song made me cringe so hard. It's so cheesy!)<br />9. I'll Follow You - 4/5<br />10. For My Sake - 4/5<br />11. My Name - 4/5<br />12. Through the Ghost - 3/5 (Less cheesy than Miracle but still pretty bad.)<br /><br />Overall Rating = 3.5 / 5 I will give the album a 4 star rating to be generous.<br /><br />If you're curious, this is how I'd rate the other albums:<br /><br />Sound of Madness - 2.5 / 5<br />Us and Them - 4 / 5<br />Leave a Whisper - 4.5 / 5

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had never heard of the series, and just stumbled across it on Amazon. I found this to be very well written, engaging, and thought provoking. A great read that now has me hooked.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|I find this a reasonably compelling piece of adult period drama.  Good acting, cinematography, costumes and of course story line.  If you are looking for a show you might have missed to tide you over between other historical/fantasy epics like Game of Thrones, catching up on this gem should be near the top of your to-do list.
034580404X|5.0|Let me start off my saying I have never read a bood front to back my whole life and heard so much about it that I borrowed the first one from my friend. I WAS HOOKED BY THE 2ND CHAPTER!!! I had to go out and immediately buy the 2nd and 3rd book. I read all 3 in a week and I want more. Its not just an erotica book with ideas to use in your own bedroom but it has a story plot to it - totally tugs at your heart strings!! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND JUST GO BUY THE WHOLE SET - YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!![[ASIN:0345803493 Fifty Shades Darker (Fifty Shades, Book 2)]][[ASIN:0345803507 Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]][[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]
1400069289|4.0|This book was on the best seller list and is a most interesting book. Marketers know more about us that we know about ourselves. Has unnecessary profanity in it which offends an old prude like me.

B003Y74AXO|4.0|This product does exactly what it says it will.  The cleaning cloth removes all but the most obnoxious fingerprints, smudges and so on.  The screen protector reduces glare (though maybe not as much as one would hope; but for me it solved the biggest moments of too much glare), and it's not overly difficult to apply to the screen.<br /><br />But a few slight caveats:<br /><br />1) This isn't an expensive item, but it appears that there are (seemingly) comparable products for less.  I haven't used any of them, so it could be that the relative expense here equals better quality.  But you might want to shop around.<br /><br />2) Before applying the screen protector to the screen, MAKE SURE YOUR SCREEN IS SPOTLESS.  This makes a huge difference in its relative invisibility.  I didn't the first time (though I found I could reapply the protector without any problems.)<br /><br />3) Apply the protector slowly, steadily and carefully to prevent any bubbles or other issues.  Not too hard to do, but not *quite* as easy as you're think.<br /><br />I will say that the protector seems incredibly fingerprint resistant (compared to the screen itself), and I love that about it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is fun but only for a little while after awhile it gets boring because some games<br />are too easy while other games are a little boring
B006H8BIIM|5.0|I'm not a fan of most of the tower defense games but I really like this game for some reason. It is less structured and doesn't force the enemies to move on any particular path, and it really keeps you busy to stay on top of things as the waves of enemies try to ruin your whole day.<br /><br />With regard to in app purchases, I was able to complete the campaign without spending real money. I enjoy the mining side game (unlocked around level 8 of the campaign) which you use to earn credits for store upgrades. Some of the upgrades are passive abilities, some enable you to buy new types of weapons with crystals mined on each level. I could earn a lot more store credits from the mining game as opposed to survival mode. I found it challenging to scrape by with few upgrades until I could earn a lot more in mining mode.<br /><br />With regard to upgrades, I like power generation for the station because all your defenses stop firing if the station can't produce enough power and depletes its batteries. Once you can build quickly enough to have a sprawling defense you'll need some of these.<br />Some levels in building speed and component durability may also be useful. Fighters are weak in small numbers but extremely dangerous in large numbers and can overwhelm laser turrets, so the missile launcher (350 credits) is effective against them.<br /><br />The interceptor laser is a good deal for 150 credits.  The rail cannon deals major damage to big baddies but costs 500. I got the proton torpedo for 2000 (impressive but not a priority) but you'd better build a lot of power plants to keep that thing firing. I didn't find the EMP upgrades to be effective with my playing style.<br /><br />Anyway, i think this game is quite enjoyable and I recommend it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game to take time away from what you are doing let it be your game for you too make sure you get it
0805095535|5.0|This extremely readable memoir artfully blends the mundane, such as lists where the author lived, with the revelatory, an epiphany while watching a troupe of dancers. There are brief moments where the curmudgeon intrudes, the type who believes the world would be a utopia if everyone conformed to certain ideals. In such moments we glimpse the person Auster would have become had he not met and fell in love with his wife. But Auster himself seems relieved he never succumbed to such a transformation. I admire the author's willingness to record the weaker side of himself (which he does without becoming confessional or trite). Had he not been so honest his story would have been less compelling.<br /><br />At the heart of the book is an implied yet profound paean for his intelligent and erudite wife who in some ways is the invisible force breathing life into the narrative. Finding such satisfaction becomes a metaphor for Auster's artistic life and his affection lightens writing that otherwise might have been ponderous.<br /><br />If you have difficulty getting through the occasional lists (I found them interesting but I'm sure some won't) do yourself a favor and press on until the Minnesota visits. They are well told vignettes and an excellent complement to the New York episodes. The powerful zenith of the narrative, the event with the dancers and a trip to Germany, is just around the corner.<br /><br />I highly recommend this readable and thought provoking memoir.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I was recommended by two females to read this book, one loved it and the other thought it was average so I went in to it with an open mind literally knowing nothing about the book apart from it containing a lot of sex. I wasn't even aware if it was written by a male or a female.<br /><br />Immediately it struck me as being written by a teenager. The language and the content seemed so immature and unrealistic and I found it so difficult to read.<br /><br />I read up until the point of the first sex scene and half way through this sex scene is where i put the book in the bin. Absolute trash. On what planet is it realistic that a 22 year old girl virgin who has never drank alcohol and never masturbated agree to have sex with a man, a billionaire no less, requiring her to sign a contract and who owns a sex dungeon. Then instead of this virgin, who has never had any type of sexual encounter, feeling pain during her first sexual encounter she orgasms twice.<br /><br />This really is a fantasy book written by a teenager and has no real-world realism. Absolute garbage.

0062197258|5.0|Catherine Bailey is a wild sexually promiscuous and careless party girl in 2003 when this story begins. She goes with friends to a new club and becomes smitten with one of the Doorkeepers of the club. She manages to run into him many times and they begin a wild sexual centered affair. That seems to be an obsession in the affair. In 2007 the carefree Catherine is a different person with such OCD that after a while the reader is totally drawn into her obsession. As the story unfolds we go back to the trial transcript that is the first few pages of book. The book is told in intermittent flashbacks between 2003 and 2007 ends in present time. Hard to put down until the last page. If you like suspense this is it!
0061673730|5.0|Well - I feel a bit sheepish writing about this book - a book I've thought about much in the six or so years since I've read it. My lingering thoughts about the book are that it covers an amazingly important subject and warns against the dangers of superficiality - it made me think about a lot of people I know - to be sure. And even about the psychological effects of branding in relation to the way that human 'tribes' (societies) bond. I think that Pirsig starts a discussion he can't close in a convincing way - though many fascinating ideas are introduced. I'm still completely fascinated by the idea and history of the 'MYTHOS' - a great follow up is watching some Adam Curtis documentaries on youtube! I RECOMMEND that to any Z.A.M.M. fan.<br /><br />Yes - I thought it provided more questions than answers - but isn't that the nature of inquiry in the very first place? The more we learn - the less we know? But really - it's those notions - those questions - those concepts that really opened up my mind. It's the amazing places that Pirsig himself can only hint at - and is only half aware of - which are the real reward for reading it. I can't recommend it enough - and I often do. I've lost about three copies I've given out as loaners - and I'm only here because I'm going to buy three more to give to deserving and receptive friends. I also need to read it again myself - so that makes four.<br /><br />Highly Recommended though not what I might call a 'tight' book or transcendent because of it's quality of writing (hint: I think 'quality' is something to do with a 'story' or narrative itself)

1936608898|5.0|This is one of the few books that I've ever felt strongly enough about to get on here and write a review.  I've been following the Whole9/Whole30 blog now for several months and when I saw the book was going to come out, I was hoping it would be good.  I just didn't realize it would be this good.  I am a practitioner that promotes healthy lifestyle change with my patients, and this book helps make my job 1000 times easier.<br /><br />I've read dozens of similar types of books over the years and it has been difficult to find a book that both is spot on in terms of making dietary recommendations that jives with the most current research, as well as a good blend of science and technical explanations while being readable to the average person. This fits those requirements perfectly.<br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar with the authors and their blog, the reason I like their approach is a) they recommend removing all possible \\"iffy\\" foods from the diet (foods that harm health) while b) adding foods that are super nutritious and are known to positively influence health.  They concede that their way might not be the only way, but to do an experiment of one (yourself!) and see how well it can work for you.  I know, it sounds very simple and basic, and it can be, but this book points out foods that are promoted as being healthy, yet may actually be harming your health.<br /><br />In my opinion, if everyone read this book and followed the Whole30, well over 50% of the people out there suffering from various health issues would find that those issues are either influenced or directly caused by what they are eating on a daily basis (even the so called \\"healthy foods\\").<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.  It's a definite must read for everyone, but especially those that feel that they could improve upon their health.  The information is spot on, backed up by research and jives with my clinical experience, and presented in a way that is easily understood byall.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|What more can be said about a book that has close to 100,000 reviews on goodreads?<br /><br />Over 900,000 readers have rated The Hunger Games an average of 4.5 stars. They say that 5 star reviews are the author's friends and family in which case Suzanne Collins must have a lot of friends or a very big family. But the ratings are high for good reason: the story of an apocalyptic future in which teenagers are selected through a national lottery to battle others to the death is believable and compelling.<br /><br />The first act of the book is the strongest, with characters who have depth and are very well nuanced as they navigate their daily lives to forage, hunt and trade for food in a police state that is the America of the future. It's here that we are introduced to Katniss Everdeen of District 12 (`The Seam'), the coal producing region. The irony of her being `chosen' to play in the Hunger Games is a good twist in a book full of twists. Peeta, her male counterpart who works in his father's bakery, is a nice kid when you get right down to it and has always had a soft spot for Katniss. Or does he? Remember--only one can survive the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The theme of how one communicates and carries oneself in a world where no one can really trust another and love is manufactured is very well done and possibly one of the reasons this book appeals as it does to young adults. I found the relationship between Katniss and Peeta dynamic, full of tension and tenderness.<br /><br />The book is not without its faults however. The second act, dealing with the games themselves--the heart of the story--is often told through long narrative passages in which the pace tends to sag. Many key events are taken off camera and the reader has to work at remembering the many contestants who were briefly introduced. At times the action writing tends toward the generic and lacks the wonderful detail seen in the first act. This is a surprise when you consider that this is primarily an action story. But wait, there is another twist. Just as we think we know how it's going to end we are turned around.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very satisfying book that sets the standard in a crowded genre. The Hunger Games won't disappoint readers of any age.ction story. But wait, there is another twist.

B007XNAOS0|4.0|By now, anyone remotely interested in the music of Baroness must have heard that Yellow & Green is a drastic departure from their dirge-like sludge metal days. Some might miss the throaty, pain-ridden vocals that were underscored by mountainous riffs, but on the other hand, they may also be pleased to find out Baroness places more emphasis on the whole picture here, showing their willingness to craft songs rather than riffs, and achieving melodic flow rather than single-minded aggression.<br /><br />The band is now dabbling with softer sounds, offering melodic constructs and a knack for building atmosphere. Tracks like \\"Twinkler\\" and \\"Eula\\" will immediately stand out on first listen; they're deliberately slow-paced and informed by detailed sound shapes. The harmonized vocal parts, extended acoustic interludes, and subtly building keyboard themes suggest Baroness have completely shed their earlier influences in favour of a simpler but equally riveting 'rock' sound. While the Red Album and Blue Record had the riffs, this one has the songs.<br /><br />In a sense, the stylistic shift in Baroness' direction and composition could be likened to that of Mastodon after their [[ASIN:B001229HEK Blood Mountain]] album. However, what Mastodon gave us after that disc was the progressive masterwork [[ASIN:B001R4MEYI Crack the Skye]], which was not only embraced by a new fan base but also indicated their desire to grow into a tighter force focusing on composition and production. Then, they released [[ASIN:B005DKLPF6 The Hunter]], which was met with more mixed reviews, though the album was still received well by their core fan base. To me, Yellow & Green marks a similar shift in direction, except that it skips the middle step (Crack the Skye) and directly jumps into a very new sound world.<br /><br />It is this change what some of Baroness' older fans may dislike, especially on first listen. I was personally baffled when I first heard these tunes, but repeat plays proved immensely rewarding. For starters, the production job by John Congleton gives the album its deserved clarity. It does not hide a single note, even during the songs' heaviest and punchiest moments. The chorus of \\"Take My Bones Away\\" would have sounded bland and lifeless if it was mixed differently. Here, it carries a melodic weight and purpose to it; one can't help but pay attention. Of course, this is no part to the spectacular song arrangements across the album.<br /><br />Compared to its sister album, Green is less accessible and more experimental. Choruses are eschewed in favour of establishing moody soundscapes and a southern rock-like aura. The touches of synths and piano lend the passages depth. The acoustic guitar playing subtle and almost ghostly. Elements of texture are thrown in the mix during the quieter moments, which heighten the scope of tunes like \\"The Line Between\\" given their more direct and in-your-face approach.<br /><br />Perhaps John Baizley's clean vocals are not his best yet. Mind you he has changed from a very aggressive delivery to one where adding the compositions nuance is paramount, and honestly the vocals were never Baroness' strongest aspect even on their earlier releases. Their strength more so lay in crafting unique riffs and melding them with pulverizing guitar work and rhythmic schemes. On this album, due to its nature, these elements are largely absent, as it seeks to highlight vocals, hooks, and melody over instrumentation.<br /><br />This double album has definitely forged a new path for Baroness, and how this change will sit with their fan base remains to be seen. What many should acknowledge, though, is that this experiment is a success and they could get much better at it on the next album.ewarding. For starters, the production job by John Congleton gives the album its deserved clarity. It does not hide a single note, even during the songs' heaviest and punchiest moments. The chorus of \\"Take My Bones Away\\" would have sounded bland and lifeless if it was mixed differently. Here, it carries a melodic weight and purpose to it; one can't help but pay attention. Of course, this is no part to the spectacular song arrangements across the album.<br /><br />Compared to its sister album, Green is less accessible and more experimental. Choruses are eschewed in favour of establishing moody soundscapes and a southern rock-like aura. The touches of synths and piano lend the passages depth. The acoustic guitar playing subtle and almost ghostly. Elements of texture are thrown in the mix during the quieter moments, which heighten the scope of tunes like \\"The Line Between\\" given their more direct and in-your-face approach.<br /><br />Perhaps John Baizley's clean vocals are not his best yet. Mind you he has changed from a very aggressive delivery to one where adding the compositions nuance is paramount, and honestly the vocals were never Baroness' strongest aspect even on their earlier releases. Their strength more so lay in crafting unique riffs and melding them with pulverizing guitar work and rhythmic schemes. On this album, due to its nature, these elements are largely absent, as it seeks to highlight vocals, hooks, and melody over instrumentation.<br /><br />This double album has definitely forged a new path for Baroness, and how this change will sit with their fan base remains to be seen. What many should acknowledge, though, is that this experiment is a success and they could get much better at it on the next album.

034547581X|5.0|I saw the movie & had to read the book. This book puts you in the action. War is a terrible thing & is had to contemplate by those who have never been through a battle or any warfare. This book helps you to understand what war is with all it's horrors, without having to take the risks or place yourself in danger. The heroism of the forces there was terrific in a morbid sense. These soldiers were surronded & fighting for survival. If anyone has a low oppinion of draftees of the vietnam era, they should read this book & ask themselves « what was I doing? Or what would I have done?». The soldiers who fought there & elsewhere were very courageous. The story reflected in the book shares the horrors of friendly fire, the sights, smells ect. of battle. The battle itself was a near run thing. I think air power saved them in the end. But they had to fight to put themselves in position to be saved. The story also reflects the dangers of our government under estimates our enemies. Good tale of caution & extreme Valor!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a reader but was intrigued by all the hype.  Read all three within 2 weeks and ready for more.

B003V4AK8E|3.0|mainly my review is about the vendor Gameseek Uk. The controller as many stated has a dead zone, especially in the one I got, the left analog stick was painful to play with, although the feeling and grip of the controller were nice, these didn't make it for the lack of response of the left analog stick. As soon as I filed a return a received an email from the vendor apologizing for the defective product (that they don't make just sell)and giving the instructions to return my item and get my refund. As today I have gotten already my refund back on my bank account so I have no complaints.
0891419063|5.0|I never would have read this book if it were not for the HBO mini-series \\"The Pacific\\". I have my BA degree in history, served five years in the Marine Corps (F 2/11, 1stMarDiv), and spent one year in Okinawa. Sledge tells the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa like it was and how life in the Marine Corps still is! I often side that I would have hated to have fought on Okinawa. Well, after five years with the Old Breed (1st Marine Division), one year on Okinawa and very limited combat during Desert Storm, after reading \\"With the Old Breed\\", I know (as best as one could) just what that fight was like. Eugene Sledge \\"Sledgehammer\\" is what is best about the Marine Corps and being a Marine. He IS a Marines Marine. I am proud to have served where Sledge and his Marines spilled their blood so that the WORLD could know freedom. Semper Fi Mac!
0399246665|2.0|These 4 books are cute and a fun idea.  But it is actually very difficult for even an adult to match the pages up.  Sometimes the matching card/page will be all the way at the back and its physically difficult to get the books pages to flip that way.  Cute idea but in real life it's not that great.  Wish I had just bought some regular Eric Carle books.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|I love the size and depth of this pool.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that it has a sprinkler but stays inflated when it's not attached.  It's perfect for my 19 month old son, 3 year old niece and my 9 month old niece to fit in.  The toys it comes with are pretty much useless, but the 9 month old likes them.  Keep up with the inflation of it, and the slide is mediocre at best - but the kids still LOVE it.  The sprinklers are sensitive and we keep the hose at a VERY low pressure as not to overpower the young kids, older kids will like it at a higher setting.  The sprinkler also is directed right at the slide to keep it wet.<br /><br />NOTE OF CAUTION:  When you hook up the sprinkler again and it has been really hot out let it go for a while, as the water that 'stayed in' the tubing will come out VERY HOT as it was baked by the sun<br /><br />overall - a great buy (well I got it for $24) and worth everyone of those pennies.  The kids LOVE it and play in it for hours.
B0086700CM|4.0|I am not much of a fan because the whole time you are in a gloomy rainy looking setting that just doesn't make sense.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the best part of this game is how many levels there are - I love how many times I'll get to play without repeat.
B000PC6A3E|1.0|The movie is fine. What is misrepresented is what is included. All the reviews comment about two disks and all the extras included. My blu ray only contained a disk inside. NOTHING else. Not even the warning about copyright like the pictures show.<br /><br />I dont know why amazon shows reviews for different products....I was expecting the extra disk.<br /><br />For the 9$ I paid, its not worth my effort to do anything, but I wanted the two disk version, and would have bought it for the few extra bucks it would have costs.....
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 5 yr old daughter and I have also been waiting for this to come out for the Kindle Fire and it was so worth the wait. We are having a blast! We are huge fans of Where's my Water and this is set up the same way. Great to see my girl have fun while shes using her brain to problem solve! Love it!
B008K8U13K|5.0|This game is fun as hell. Amazon and sega need to work on it though. Iplayed this game on my other tablet and it was fun, and fun on here too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written, fantasy for the semi-intellectual. Off the beaten track and a pleasant surprise. Who knew S-M could be so entertaining?
0064431789|5.0|I purchased this for my son who has become obsessed with bedtime stories.  Along with several other books, this came quickly and everything was in fantastic condition.  I was hoping to get my son into good literature, he loves his new books, unfortunately after reading them I have to follow it up with \\"Moo, Baa, La La La\\" ...torture.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and a little addicting. The app keeps me busy for a long time.  Its has lots to do. not just lots but lots  and lots to do.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|The Fifty Shades book are some of my favourite ever! Although there is lots of sex it's also an amazing love story.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Another great game by G5 and its free. There is some things that you can spend real cash on but it doesn't really effect progress in the game. This is just as good as the other city games by G5 defanitly recomended
034580404X|4.0|hotter than a heat wave!<br />Good summer read and quite an education to the otherside of things.<br />The family is sharing it but we are not really discussing it in detail lol!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I was prepared not to like this but have come to realize that it is intelligent, engaging, cool, steampunk-filled action.  Of course, those who hold to the classic Sherlock Holmes will never agree and I can't fault them.  But for those who've never read the books and just want to see an action movie .....<br /><br />I enjoyed the plot and the choreographed fight scenes.  I enjoyed Holmes' character and Watson's character, their gypsy allies, and their love/hate relationship.  Prof. Moriarity makes a downright nasty villian, as does his sharpshooting assassin sidekick.  Holmes' nearly supernatural insight & foresight are a stretch, but still very enjoyable.  In a second he looks at a perilous situation (like a fight) and works out the next 10 moves, like a chess Grandmaster.  Watson, his \\"Bishop\\", is likewise very enjoyable to watch in action.  There's elements of violence/action mixed in with intelligent scripting and even comedy.  (Like when the sharpshooter has Watson pinned down, but Watson finds a cannon to shoot back at him.  The sharpshooter mutters, \\"that's not fair\\" as he scurries away.)  It has LOTS of Steampunk elements - Cool metallic gadgets and \\"neat\\" WWI-era armaments, all enhanced by the director's stop-action super detail-oriented techniques and gritty photography.  (I loved the scene: \\"let's introduce them to little Hansel,\\" ... a giant cannon!)  Makes you really think that you're watching turn-of-the-century Europe!  But action alone can't make a winning movie, and \\"A Game of Shadows\\" delivers the intelligent plot to go along with the action.  Like Dr. Moriarity trying to start a war by using terrorism (predates WWI).  Like our heroes trying to figure out where the next terrorist act will be, or trying to analyze clues for which disguised man is going to shoot the Arch-duke.  It does engage your mind.<br /><br />Some reviewers didn't like the casting of Harris as Moriarity, but that's their totally subjective opinion.  Like which is better, Blue orRed?  I thought he was great (ie you hate him) without being the typical cliched Hollywood villian.<br /><br />Why doesn't it get 5 stars?  Because the director goes over-the-top (arrogance? assumes his fans don't care?) with stupid \\"stuff.\\"  For example Holmes' brother is hosting Watson's fiance at his home and he greets her in the morning stark naked. Very stupid and it would never happen in England in 1900!  Also for example the pseudo-gay stuff like making Holmes dress in drag, lie down half-naked during a firefight and tell Watson, \\"Come lie down with me!\\"  Just this little over-the-top irritating stuff that knocks it down from 5 to 4 stars.  Also, I'm sure that true Sherlock Holmes fans have never gotten over giving the gig to a very non-British-looking American actor (Robert Downey Jr.), despite his talent and ability to flawlessly speak with a British accent.  But if you've accepted Downey Jr. as Holmes by now, and you don't require adherence to the original Sherlock Holmes character & stories, then this movie is better than the first in my opinion.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all of the fuss over this book, I took a chance against the advice from other reviews and purchased it on my Kindle. WHAT A WASTE!! It took me over a week to read it in hopes that it would get better which it never did. I was looking forward to a love story but instead got a book about a guy that likes to mistreat women....not my style in life or books!
0345472322|3.0|Such an important topic. Interesting, affirming, guiding. It will change how you talk to yourself, your children, and the people you work with. Unfortunately, I think it would have been much better presented as a feature article in a serious magazine; there's just not enough meat here for a whole book. In fact, the first chapter really says everything you need to know: that intelligence (and every other skill) can be increased and learned and having a growth mindset, rather than a fixed mindset, will get you there. In addition, you can learn to have a growth mindset, and (unfortunately) you can change a growth mindset into a fixed mindset. The difference is all in what you say to yourself / to others.<br /><br />As I said, a great topic and very valuable, but example after example of how different athletes or different CEOs did or did not have a growth mindset and how it helped or hurt their careers does not make for a great book.<br /><br />You made an excellent first try Dr. Dweck. Keep at it, and I know your next book will be even better. (If I've done it right, that's growth mind talk.)
B006RUJST6|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. It was a very easy read and wonderful story of life and inspiration. I am so excited to start reading Point of Retreat.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Little did I realize how far and how deep I would travel with this novel. A brilliantly written piece that leaves me in awe of the written word. The story and insufferable details are not for the faint of heart. At times I did the equivalent of squinting my eyes at watching a horror and I skimmed as I read, not because I didn't want to read but because I was afraid to feel too much of the very real pain presented before me. Yes, I was a coward. Nonetheless, the characters and their tale were not and they were impossible to leave once you stood by their lives for a mere moment.<br /><br />The book taught me about a world I always felt so foreign to me, and I didn't even really care to know it because preconceived notions and the pain of being mere miles away from 9/11 would make it all too real. I am glad however that my world has been made a little bit bigger by this story. I am grateful.<br /><br />I give it 5-stars for writing, character development and richness of plot and detail. However I honestly would have liked to have had a few more detailed scenes that reinforced the building of trust and connection between the female characters. I think this is perhaps the only small flaw that indicated to me this was a story of women's friendship told by a man. For this reason I am detracting a star and honestly because a true 5-star book to me is one I would reread. Once was enough for me, it left me full, soulful and with a new perspective.
0345803485|1.0|One of the most terribly written books out there. If I have to read one more reference to the main character's \\"inner goddess,\\" I might seriously die. It's telling about this country that these books have become so popular. Horribly written, both artistically and technically. The story is stupid. The characters are annoying and completely unlikable. If you are looking for erotic fiction, check out Anais Nin or even some of Anne Rice's stuff. So much better than this drivel!
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I am rather new to this issue, and normally against most \\"Conspiracy\\" Theories; but IMHO, the Shakespeare Authorship Controversy IS a legitimate mystery.<br />If you listen to the commentary on this DVD, the film makers honestly admit that they took liberties with the factual record while making this movie. They acknowledge several of those liberties, and openly imply that there are others that they didn't elaborate on. This is one reason why I wish films like this would ALWAYS include additional commentaries by 'real' historians who comment on the facts relating to the action on-screen, but I'm not aware of ANY movie that has this type of commentary.<br /><br />AS RELATES TO THE AUTHORSHIP QUESTION- IMHO there is little doubt that the man from Stratford-on-Avon is not the author of the works attributed to him.<br /><br />(1) It is undisputed that the Stratford=Shakespeare was a well-known stage-actor, and part-owner of theater(s); but the record of him ACTUALLY writing those works, is mostly built on ASSUMPTIONS, i.e, that he simply MUST HAVE, written them.<br />Which is actually the same argument about his education. We KNOW nothing-nada-zip-zilch about his education, but, in a similar vein, the traditionalists insist that he certainly MUST HAVE gotten an education similar to what they propose.<br /><br />(2) It is unknown about whether Stratford-Shakespeare was literate or not.<br />It is almost certain, that his father, who was, at various times in his life, VERY SUCCESSFUL in business, and in local politics, was illiterate, and signed legal documents using the method of \\"making a mark\\".<br />One of Stratford-Shakespeare's daughters seems to have been fairly literate, while the other one, probably not.<br />The Stratford-Shakespeare was VERY financially successful, and as a Stage-Actor, he certainly must have known how to read, in order to learn his lines.<br />BUT, in spite, of all the amazing output from \\"Shakespeare-the-Author\\", there is not one surviving document written by the hand of 'William Shakespeare' from Stratford-on-Avon, nor is there any known document that ever existed, and is now known to have been lost.<br />There is a very rich public record of many activities and events in the Statford-Shakespeare's life, but the only things in existence from his own hand, are SIX(6) signatures, all of which are virtually unrecognizable- AND THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN.<br /><br />(3) IF THE MAN FROM STRATFORD DIDN'T WRITE THAT STUFF, WHO DID ??? There are lots of good theories, but none of them without problems. And this is a wonderful mystery to investigate, which will probably never be solved.<br /><br />(4) FINALLY, I learned lots of little tidbits in from this film; mostly about the Cecil's
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I enjoy camping and need something handy, small, compact and durable to sharpen my knives.  As you know, knives go dull fast (at least heavily used ones!),and a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one.  Why you ask?  It's quite simple; you do not have 100% control of a dull knife and a loss of control of a knife can lead to serious injury.  I have stones, but they are heavy.  I wanted something that I can take on hikes, or even use in survival situations.  I came across this little beauty and just a couple of days after I ordered it I used it.  I was so impressed.  It will sharpen any knife to a sharp \\"brand new\\" blade condition.  It has three sharpeners.  The first is used to fix blades that are damaged and chipped.  The second is to sharpen to a fine edge, and the third is a small sharpener poker to sharpen serrated edges, or knives with groves or custom designs.  I love it and may even get a backup!
1442337966|4.0|I quite enjoyed The Power. I listened to it everyday on my way to and from work. Quite entertaining and fascinating.<br /><br />I believe in positive thinking and was interested in all the examples she gave about how positive thinking works in our lives.<br /><br />Some of it was a little bit hard to swallow. I pretty much agreed with it all till she got to the part about how we don't have to die. The only reason people die (per her theory) is because we believe we're supposed to get old/sickly and die. Even if it is true, I'm not so sure I want to live 500 years--imagine the taxes!! Plus, Social Security would be pretty non-existent by then!!<br /><br />She (and the Power) is all about positivity. Turning away from negative thoughts/feelings.<br />So mostly, it is great and so interesting that it went fast.<br /><br />Enjoy and take what is good from it and use it in your life. We'd all be better people if we were more positive.
B006N9KFPC|4.0|I've been a huge Adam Lambert fan since Idol, and he doesn't disappoint with his second album. Trespassing is hip, fun, and just a blast to listen to. I love the first half the of the CD -- Trespassing, Naked Love, Shady, etc. -- but I found the second half just average. But hey, each to our own, right? Anyway, I really enjoyed the album, so I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something new and awesome to listen to :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts off easy and gradually increases in difficulty, allowing players to get the feel of the game but lets them skip ahead to harder levels if the increments are not sufficient. The requirement of filling the board completely is the perfect twist to this game and it is easy to see why this is a #1 free app.  timtechsoftware.com
B007V5CF5K|5.0|lots of fun!  if you like hog this is worth the. 99. however do not download the sequel. the sequal does not work well,  and has several game play issues.

B00006HYQ5|5.0|I got this travel mouse when I bought my IBM Thinkpad T42.  I summarize below why I think it is the best mouse I have used in the last 20 years:<br /><br />1. Optical (well all of them are now, but did you remember you have to clean the ball regularly in those old mechanic mouse?)<br />2. Wired.  I don't like wireless mouse for gaming purpose, they all have non-responsive glitch from time to time.<br />3. The cord won't interfere the mouse action (mostly).  Some mouse motion just heavily influenced by the cord, this one seems not so severe.<br />4. Small.  So that I can control the mouse reaching all around the screen just by moving my fingers.  I won't need to move my palm at all.  This mean you will be less tired during long session of gaming.<br />5. Durable.  It has last for 7 years now and work like new.<br /><br />The only cons:<br />1. A little pricier comparing to other travel mice.  Anyway, I bought another one for my son who reached the age of gaming.<br /><br />Hope this help.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Simply amazing product for the money you spend.<br /><br />Pros: Great performance, huge overclocking potential, it's in a black box.<br />Cons: Stock fan is loud but doesn't really matter to me (something to keep in mind if keeping original heatsink/fan), it doesn't make sandwiches.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book continues the great saga of a world at war.  There are so many main players that it is a difficult book to set aside for a week and then continue without having to think, \\"now who is this again?\\"  There are many minor charactures that Martin follows who he then kills off one way or another only to replace them with another minor characture.  Not that the main players are safe as we found out with the young wolf and his father a couple of books back.  The breadth of this novel is truely remarkable.  The charactures are endearing.  The story is facinating.  This is not a stand alone book!  Highly recommend this series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|50 Shades was descriptive, captivating, erotic, sweet.  I really enjoy getting to know the characters and living in their life for a while.  I like the way the main characters grow and change during the story.

B0015AARJI|5.0|I love the controller works great very comfortable to hold maybe be small but it fits my hands just perfect bottom triggers could be shaped smaller though to prevent pressing.
B0052REQLK|5.0|As phase of change is becoming rapid, we forget wisdom of the aged and regard the real experience in life as old things which cannot apply in this fast changing world.  However, this book showed the real and lasting wisdoms of old peple of America are still valid  today.

B000FC11JW|4.0|This book is one of must books for persons working at any organization whether it is profit or non-profit one.  2nd reading in E-book by Kindle on my iphone has been much better.  I read it a long time ago.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Clear and concise, the animations are great and the descriptions also.<br /><br />To the people complaining about the permissions: The developer himself has let me know that these are a result of unremovable modules in the developers toolkit that he used to build the app. They are unavoidable, and this app doesn't actually DO anything nefarious.<br /><br />But, y'know - don't let a little reality get in the way of your paranoia
B004UOCF3W|4.0|If you like the Foo Fighters sound, you'll like this album.  Using the vintage FF rhythm, the band has made the album unique enough to distinguish it from its other balads while holding true to its roots.  I definitely recommend making the purchase.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I completely forgot about this book until I heard someone mention it one random day. Then I remembered that I had read it in 7th grade. This book was still great the second time around! The author does an incredible job of describing the scenes throughout the story. You are in touch with the main character Jonas, you feel what he is going through. I especially liked when Jonas first discovered colors, and how he was now viewing his life, and community. The story makes you wonder if we as humans are missing out on something really special in the our world. Just like Jonas had when he first realized love, and how his community didn't know how to understand the concept.
0345803485|1.0|What exactly is it about this book that so many people love? I just finished it and felt like it was written by a teenager. The story wasn't even interesting and the characters are ridiculous.
0345803485|5.0|Okay I don't know what is wrong with people but this book is amazing! I love it! Yea she gets off a lot but who wouldn't if a guy could do that!! I think a perticular guy that has wrote a review just has never been able to please a women like Mr. Gray can. And so what if they get married at the end as predicted? Isn't it said that one of the top reason for divorce is couples not having enough/good sex? Well um HELLO! Their having a lot and very good sex yea i wouldn't be surprised if they got married. And kids? Of course! Do some of you need to go back to sex ed?? How are babies made?? I think this book is great and i would be so happy if my husband could do half of this things to me. And hey if it can spice up our marriage and give us some more pleasure i'll read all three books! Which i plan to. My husband even says he's getting a little jealous of the book cause of how i react while i'm reading it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Having completed Where's the Water, I found these puzzles slightly more challenging, but even more fun. Don't forget to tap on Perry periodically...
B008JGSM6G|3.0|When you first start out on the game, it is very addictive and fun. However, some levels are too complex and a complete waste of my time. It takes me at least 20 minutes to finish one of the harder levels, and this game tends to be annoying with it's awkward puzzles. Overall it is an O.K app, therefore it receives three stars.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|The movie was shipped out very fast and was received when told it would be here. Upon opening the movie however the dvd case was cracked all across the top of the case.played the movie which seems to be alright.I think these movies need more protection while being shipped.I'm just glad that the movie was not damaged.

B006GGR5QY|5.0|This is music that needs its own genre! I usually re-tag it as \\"Neo-Classical\\" - classical in nature, but modern in sound. Similar artists are Max Richter, Sylvain Chauveau, and Danny Norbury. One of the songs on here sounds very much like Max Richter's \\"Henry May Long\\" soundtrack. It's not easy listening, but it is peaceful and beautifully orchestrated. Wonderful music for reading a good book. It's a bit short, but it's not a bad thing to have an album where you're wanting more!
0143119680|2.0|There is a lot about this book I enjoyed and (initially) liked. The literature, historical and mythological references.  The attempt to incorporate science and theories of evolution in a supernatural tale.  The settings all over the world; the setting in libraries and discussions of ancient texts.  The lead character is a strong woman, athletic and independent.  But there was so much about the book that derailed it for me from these little jewels.  I feel bad in not liking this book as I know so many people love it.<br /><br />This book is too long for the story being told.  It should have been edited down and shortened.  The descriptions of food, scent and appearances of people are just too detailed and drag on endlessly.  The descriptions of clothes and in getting ready to go places really do not add anything to the story, in my opinion.  I hated how the author described Diana's (the lead's) hair and eye color.  I don't understand how a person's eyes can contain all colors or a person's hair contain all colors.  I likely could have ended up liking this story if it hadn't employed one of my most hated themes.  I really really really hate when male characters treat the heroine like she is a child - telling her what she needs to eat, when she needs to eat, when she should sleep, insisting on naps (blocking her exit from rooms because he believes she is too tired, warning her that an activity will be cut short if he sees her looking tired) and deciding for her what behavior is safe or not.  I don't find this level of control endearing or sweet, I think it is obnoxious.  My father didn't even do this to me when I was a teenager and I do not think there is anything romantic about a love interest doing this.<br /><br />I love historical rooted stories and stories about ancient secrets and I love stories set at universities.  But I really get tired of stories where the hero knew all the famous people ever and only studied at the top most elite schools.  Granted, a vampirethat has lived 1500 years isn't realistic so why should I expect a more common life for him?  I just get tired of this trope.  There are more universities in the world outside of Harvard and Oxford, plenty of good researchers and professors work at these and it would be just as interesting to have a story set at a different school.  The same could be said for an ancient being, how likely is it that he knew every single famous scholar - Machievelli, Darwin, Newton, etc.?  What about the common people, what about all of the other people in history whose tales didn't survive to be retold?  I know I am getting too serious for the type of book this was, but it just missed the mark for me.  It is sad that it ultimately let me down, because the first 25% started off so strongly and I was hopeful that I would end up loving this book.  I won't be reading the sequel.  I do see where this book would appeal to other readers, it just wasn't for me.
B0017SWSCW|4.0|A very good story. Very much enjoyed the courtroom scenes and had to wonder if Mr Archer's on time behind bars in part helps with the interesting scenes that take place inside the prison! Some nice moments of humour as well.<br /><br />Recommended reading. Clearly has parallels to Prisoner of Monte Cristo but no so much as to leave with with too much of a Deja Vu feeling.<br /><br />Once you get going with this one it's hard to put down.
B002QY9RMA|1.0|Beyonce,  did you just release this album just for the sake of releasing an album? Reader, I still don't get why SINGLE LADIES won the GRAMMY SONG OF THE YEAR. utter insult to the talent of other contenders for the award. There are by far better nominees who deserve to win. The only  genuine definition of an R&B album is Beyonce's  'dangerously in love\\" deBut album. The songs on I AM SASha Fierce sound generic. After that, album sales began to decrease and I am not surprised. The only song I like is the opener 'If I Were a Boy'. Don't buy.

B0051X56FK|1.0|Beyonce, I have to ask you one question, have you run out of creative juices ? Reader, aside from upbeat numbers like \\"loVe on top\\" and \\"Party\\" , this album is merely filled with fillers and uninspired work. Bored me a lot. The only Beyonce album that defines real R & B is her debut 'dangerously in love' album. After that,her subsequent albums have failed a lot in comparison. Don't buy. So disappointing.
B00428CCPW|5.0|I purchased this for my college-aged sister in law.  She likes it a lot.  The colors are beautiful and she will use it to hang on her wall at her new apartment.  It is also exciting for die-hard Taylor Swift fans to have a slightly different version of her album, so I think this would be a great gift for any fan.

1451683405|1.0|Recently I spent an hour at a local Barnes and Noble, hiding from the heat-wave, reading Sam Harris' new, popular, and provocative Freewill.  At the risk of hyperbole (and shedding any legitimacy or credibility), I must say that I found the work to be an unbearable disaster of a philosophical argument.  If only to emphasize my true distaste for this work, I must admit that it took me two separate attempts to finish the book, as I was initially overtaken by frustration by page 9... (I promise to end my complaining and make a real argument now.)<br /><br />In order to examine this book, I would like to engage a few specific points that I found particularly problematic throughout.<br /><br />Harris' first error can be identified in his attempt to ground his thesis--that freewill is an illusion--in the following (false) dichotomy:<br /><br />\\"Either our wills are determined by prior causes and we are not responsible for them, or they are the product of chance and we are not responsible for them. \\" (p.5)<br /><br />Here, Harris reveals his reductive-positivistic presuppositions with absolute clarity.  For Harris, free-will could only be the product of two sources, either the cause-effect chains of \\"medium-sized dry goods\\" (Austin) or the randomness of the quantum level.  Yet, this argument fails to refute, or even acknowledge, the principal topos of free-will within much (or most) of both traditional and contemporary philosophy--that is, the transcendent.  By this, I certainly do not advocate an uncritical reliance upon the religious notion of the soul, but merely point back to the transcendental consciousness of German Idealism and transcendental phenomenology, or the more recent embodied consciousness of existentialism and French phenomenology.  That any phenomenon could find its origin outside of the nexus of physical reality, understood in the most dogmatic and simply unreflective sense, is simply out of the picture for Harris.  The closest he is willing to approachthis subject is by way of the casual (and unconvincing) brushing-aside of the \\"soul\\" as irrelevant to the question of free-will.<br /><br />The second, and perhaps crucial error of Freewill can be summarized in the following quote:<br /><br />\\"Consider what it would take to actually have free will.  You would need to be aware of all the factors that determine your thought and actions and you would need to have complete control over these factors.\\" (p. 13, emphasis mine)<br /><br />Although (perhaps) initially convincing, this argument relies upon two problematic words, \\"all\\" and \\"complete,\\" which Harris' discussion simply does not justify.  The criteria that Harris has set forward for freewill is simply unnecessarily \\"rigorous.\\"  As I once stated in a debate concerning this perspective, even Sartre, the champion of freewill par excellence, does not make such stringent requirements of freewill.  Instead, he, like all major thinkers on the subject, recognizes that freewill is consistently limited, pressed, and urged by factors both internal and external to the individual.  What Harris fails to recognize is that desire is not = to will.  The act of \\"wanting something\\" (passive) is not correlate to the act of \\"choosing something\\" (active).  By identifying the sources of our biases, our desires, etc. Harris believes that he has identified the sole sources of our decision making processes.  On the contrary, it is an undeniable factor of the human condition (as beings in a world) that we will be constantly influenced by our surroundings.  Nonetheless, this does not negate the validity of our will.<br /><br />If I might take one of his examples, he asks the reader to think of a city.  He then asserts that those cities which did not appear to the mind as options (did not occur as a choice) were not true options.  Thus, he says, freewill is an illusion.  Yet, even if I grant him his specific point (that those \\"other\\" cities were not true options)  he has still failed to establish that my decision, chosen from the set of cities which did appear to consciousness, was not a real choice.  Even if Freewill is not unlimited or infinite, it might still be, in a very meaningful sense, free.<br /><br />I could continue to touch upon various other weakness, including the ambiguity of his \\"I\\" (which appears, often [but not always] identical to the brain, sometimes transcendent to the brain, and seemingly never, encompassing the entire person [embodied]).  But I will simply end at this point, reiterating that this work is fundamentally unsatisfying, tremendously philosophically sloppy, and recommendable to no one.<br /><br />If you're interested in the relationship between Philosophy of Mind and Freewill, save yourself the trouble and read someone who is worth studying, perhaps Dennett.
0547424779|1.0|The ONLY reason I went ahead and read, THE GIVER, by Lois Lowry is because it was chosen for one of the book clubs I attend.  Like many reviewers I've read Orwellian books; and more importantly, books which included a wide range of ideology of social, political, and religious philosophy written by famed scholars [Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, John Locke, Nietzche, Karl Marx etc.,].  For this reason, it escapes me why anyone with a minimal education that included a few courses in classic philosophy/literature would bother with this book.<br /><br />From the first pages, I became IMMEDIATELY impatient with the book's premise and storyline.  I found it irritating, impertinent, and ultimately irrelevant.  Worse, despite claims to the book's creative 'originality' I found this to be an overstatement.<br /><br />Why was I frustrated, annoyed, and unnerved by Lowry's, THE GIVER???  Probably because the notion of a perfect society - by it's very definition is flawed, and thus futile.<br /><br />Conversely, I absolutely do give credit to Lowry for her efforts [and courage] to tackle an 'absolute' theory such as perfection and/or utopianism into a story which attempts to expounds  'ideal' concepts such as societal equality, justice, and absence of suffering.  This is a high goal for any writer.  Yet, for me this seemed rather presumptive -and a somewhat naive and unnerving premise.  For example, from the onset, the dialogue which Jonas has with his family group when they gather at the table to express their 'feelings' about events of their day, I knew immediately the futility of the task facing Jonas when he expressed his fears about becoming a 'twelve' - not yet aware that he would assume the role as 'The Giver'.  Consequently, for me, it was a 'no-brainer' that Lowry's ending fell off the cliff.  How could she possibly postulate [literally or figuratively] a credible scenario wherein Jonas' society could thrived harmoniously and in unison within 'utopian perfection'. [Oxymoron.]<br /><br />Finally, ideologically, I simply did not like the book primarily because implicit in the concept [definition] of utopianism is the ideal of a 'perfect' society or world order.  To this end, Lowry's fails clumsily in her attempt to construct a storyline which ULTIMATELY brings forth a social-cultural utopia where all the various factors come together in 'perfect' unity and harmony to contrast with a society absent of order and in chaos.<br /><br />Post Script 8/19/12: Because of all the positive reviews, I researched the author and learned that Lowry is the author of children's books, and that 'The Giver' was intended for younger readers.  For this reason, I better understand Lowry's intent.  However, I think 'Lord of The Flies', and 'Animal Farm' were better.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />July 19, 2012n.]<br /><br />Finally, ideologically, I simply did not like the book primarily because implicit in the concept [definition] of utopianism is the ideal of a 'perfect' society or world order.

8866131369|4.0|I am a big fan of moleskine. I have used their plain notebooks and I'm currently using their travel journal. For some reason, the paper in this planner is a bit thinner than the other moleskine books I have, which isn't so great since I like writing with a fountain pen. The ink does bleed through a bit. Besides that small detail, I really like this planner. The best part of this planner is having the notes page on the right side! I am pretty happy with this purchase.

0425263908|3.0|Caution: Spoilers and rants ahead.<br /><br />It's impossible to talk about Sylvia Day's BARED TO YOU without mentioning E. L. James' FIFTY SHADES OF GREY, and thus Stephenie Meyer's TWILIGHT. The bare essentials: A young woman falls in love with beautiful, wealthy man who stalks her, and she's okay with that. And in that respect, BARED TO YOU seems to be fan fiction of fan fiction. Is there a technical term for that? From the acknowledgements section: \\"To E. L. James, who wrote a story that captivated readers and created a hunger for more. You rocked it!\\" Huh.<br /><br />How is BARED TO YOU supposed to be read: as erotic fiction or erotic romance? Erotica doesn't require the characters to live HEA together. But in the case of erotic romance, the characters live HEA together, and readers must WANT them to. The first book in a trilogy, there's no conclusive ending, but it's happy-for-now - IF you want the characters to be together.<br /><br />Most romances don't work because I don't WANT the characters to be together. And that's the Crossfire trilogy's big problem: If readers are supposed to want Eva and Gideon to have a happy ending together, the author has massively failed.<br /><br />BARED TO YOU squicks me out on so many levels. I don't like the characters individually, I don't like them together, Eva's love for Gideon seems superficial, and Gideon needs a therapist more than he needs a lover. They have instant lust, but I just don't understand why Eva loves Gideon. He's hot, he's wealthy, he gets her off, he's a corporate big-wig (think Richard Branson, with so many business ventures), but he's just not FUN. He's rude, he's demanding, and he stalks Eva. None of the Crossfire characters has a sense of humour.<br /><br />Eva's had a tough past: Her stepbrother sexually abused her, impregnated her, and she miscarried. Since then, her mother has been overprotective, monitoring her comings and goings, and whatnot. Eva doesn't like this (neither do I). But when Gideondoes the same thing, including monitoring her phone activity, Eva lets it slide. Sure, she's a little angry at first, but she forgives him again and again, particularly after sex. Remember that \\"Family Guy\\" skit of a romantic comedy film trailer? \\"All your problems will be solved by my penis.\\" Yeah, that's pretty much why Eva always lets him get away with it.<br /><br />So Eva spills her problems, but Gideon doesn't share his. All we know is that he was sexually abused, and he has violently sexual nightmares. He even tries to sleep-rape Eva, and her flatmate Cary is reasonably concerned for her wellbeing. Gideon has had women love him, but he's never loved anyone until Eva.<br /><br />Okay, so she's beautiful, she gets him off, and she makes him feel comfortable enough to share snippets of his past. But I just don't like her, either.<br /><br />And Gideon and Eva don't want each other to have heterosexual friends. Eva has gay men buddies, but she doesn't have any gal pals. So Gideon goes psycho when Eva becomes friendly with his stepbrother. Eva goes a bit psycho over Gideon's friend Magdalene, and even more psycho over his ex-fiancée Corinne. But in a rare display of female alliance, Eva and Magdalene briefly bond...over their hatred for Corinne.<br /><br />I like Cary in the beginning, because his concerns for Eva are mine, too, and he has a nice boyfriend. But Cary cheats with a female, and things get worse by the end of the novel, when Eva stumbles home to a ménage á quatre [sound-tracked, in my mind, by Flight of the Conchords' \\"Too Many Dicks (on the Dancefloor)\\"]. Again, Cary's and Gideon's back-stories must be saved for revealing in the next two books.<br /><br />Gideon's stalking makes BARED TO YOU more psychological thriller or horror than anything else. Key quote: \\"I recreated your room based on the photo I took of you sleeping.\\" Don't tell me that's not creepy, because it totally is.<br /><br />Ex-fiancée Corinne says \\"possessiveness is much betterthan indifference\\". Eva seems to believe that, too. Gideon seems to attract a certain type of women: those that believe stalking equals love. That would be funny if it wasn't so depressing.<br /><br />But I will say this of BARED TO YOU: It packs a mighty emotional punch, with plenty of scares and conflict. It could never be accused of being \\"meh\\" - you will either love it or get angry with it. Either way, issues abound for book clubs and newspaper columns to discuss.

8590379825|3.0|This is the first programming language I decided to pick up. I can tell the book tries to cater to both new and experienced programmers, but tends to lean towards the latter more often. Frequently throughout the book, I asked myself, \\"What is the author talking about and when did he introduce it?\\" Also, the individual bits of code in examples offer a mediocre amount of explanation, which causes frustration when something is not understood. The concepts presented are solid and straight to the point. Now, when the book began talking about \\"Part IV: The C API,\\" I lost it completely. There was BARELY any information on C, as Ierusalimschy assumed that all readers would be seasoned programmers with C.<br /><br />A quick guide to Lua, but has trouble with actually explaining things in-depth. For first-timers, I recommend \\"Beginning Lua Programming\\" by Kurt Jung and Aaron Brown.
B007NQVRNS|5.0|Caviezel and Quaid star in this fantastic 2000 scifi flick. The story is unique and inspired. John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) begins to communicate with his deceased father (Dennis Quaid) in the past via an old radio as the northern lights seem to be affecting the instrument. But as Caviezel begins sharing with his father, the past begins to change. And a serial killer that was once stopped is now on the loose again. Full of heart-wrenching drama, suspense, and danger - this is a must for any scifi fan's movie library. I previously owned the DVD, and the blu-ray edition is quite a bit clearer and sharper.

0385344228|4.0|I have to say I couldn't put this book down but...I was a little disappointed at the ending.  With all the detail put into the whole story it seemed like something was missing at the end.  Some people commented on the characters lacking substance...I never thought that.  I found that Andy was in such denial about things...I know people like that!  I could relate to Jacob's Mom, Laurie...as a Mom you go through hell with your child but at least she was reasonable.  All in all a very good read, will definitely look for more of Landay's books.

0606259090|1.0|I tried to read this to see what all the hub-bub was about and was astonished that so many people were going crazy for it. There are tiny, Half paragraph \\"scenes\\" that look like the author forgot to take some of her notes out of the manuscript, they were that bad and unnecessary.  The character is not interesting at all, and the style is really unpolished. If you're looking for a great romance story with elements of BDSM, then please save yourself the money, time and aggravation and buy \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" by Jacqueline Carey. Beautifully written, romantic, dark, suspenseful, with a protagonist that is both interesting and three dimensional. Don't buy \\"Fifty Shades...\\". Just don't.

The songs are fresh, while the music reminds me of kinder, simpler, gentler days.  A most well-spent $10.  Thanks, Beach Boys!  You guys are AWESOME!

B00026WU82|5.0|I don't get into ranking rock albums. I don't compare them to eachother and debate who or what is the greatest. It doesn't make any sense. I do however, think there is a certain level of creative greatness that can be achieved by the human mind, and \\"Highway '61 Revisited\\" has achieved it.<br /><br />Long reviews rub me the wrong way, so I'll just say that every song on this recording was an historical recording. Nothing else before or after this album has sounded like it. It is in a class all by itself. So many things have already been said about it, so I will write in general terms. These are not songs that are about topics. These are songs about the human mind, the human predicament, and lack of a concrete reality in human experience. Everything we think we know is challenged by the words in combination with the melodies. The best part about it is nothing is challenged directly. In the highest, most artistic way all meaning is conveyed by showing, not telling. We are left to draw our own conclusions, which can only be drawn via sensory experince. Dylan gives no questions and no answers, just situations tied into universal human experiences.<br /><br />Is there any popular song more powerful than \\"Desolation Row\\"? Is it the lyrics, the voice matched with the simple chords changes, or the beautiful guitar playing that accompanies Dylan's singing? Is it that it lasts 10 minutes, wth one, heartbreaking harmonica solo? Or, is \\"Desolation Row\\" so profound because it follows \\"Like A Rolling Stone,\\" \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" \\"Queen Jane Approximately,\\" or \\"Just Like Tom Thumb Blues\\"? How about the lazy, oddly settling \\"It Takes A Lot to Laugh\\"? Somehow that loping country song fits with this recording in its otherwise epic grandeur. It works in a way that seems to say, this is still just music, folks. Don't take any of it too seriously. Dylan has so much style every word he utters on this recording means something. There are no insignificant words or notes. It's all a perfect melding of extraordinary elements.<br /><br />It all works, independently and together. No song is about any one thing, but all together the meaning is there. It has as much to do with image and lifestyle as it does with music. Everything matters. It is the human mind in its most profound level of artistic expression.

I read all 3 books in less than 2 weeks, it captured my attention that much.  I also did my part in getting others to read it as well.  Those who I have recommended the book to enjoyed it also.  I give it 2 thumbs up!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ok I admit it,I jumped on the 50 Shades of Grey bandwagon and read all 3 books. It was slightly entertaining,more annoying. Then I learned that E L James wrote Twilight fan fiction and that these characters are not even loosely based on the main Twilight characters,they are largely based on the Twilight characters. If you don't believe go read for yourself. Google search Masters of the universe by snowqueens ice dragon and read for yourself. No originality at all! It full out plagerism! If people want to read good erotica then look at the European erotica!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|What more can be said about Hugh Howey's WOOL, right? I suspect readers have just barely scratched the surface. WOOL is a delightfully wicked post-apocalyptic story, packed with an even flowing, inexhaustible supply of cleverly crafted allegorical and symbolic devices. From the Silo itself to the division of classes, Howey develops an irresistible world with jarring number of eye opening parallels to our own pre-apocalyptic existence.<br /><br />Beyond this lies an engaging science fiction story, filled with intrigue, deception and hope. The deeper you dig into the series, the better it gets, though I have to admit that the first book in the series was by far my favorite. The job of Sheriff within the Silo reminded me of Sean Connery's role as Marshall O'Niel, in the early eighties sci-fi classic Outland.<br /><br />I agree that Howey's Wool is destined to be a science fiction classic in the same vein as Heinlein, Bradbury or Asimov. I know this sounds lofty, but Wool has all of the suspenseful, thought provoking, well-developed elements that drew me into the science fiction classics. I look forward to future installments of the Wool series and to catching up on Howey's books.

B003Y5H574|2.0|It's slow in the beginning and middle, and doesn't get good or interesting until towards the end. I just felt like they dragged it on, and on. The first hour and a half is just about the main character trying to lay a bunch of women. I won't ruin the plot for people who are still interested in watching this, but consider this a heads-up.

B008EQIEWS|2.0|The bottomline is that if you want some background noise while you are relaxing for the day, this is the movie. If you want something that will keep your attention and produce riveting action--don't spend money on this.<br /><br />I have to admit that this was pretty bad...but this is indicative of many 21st Century movies I have seen at this point--no distinguished plot, actors (despite fame), and leaves you unfufilled when seeking a great flick. This movie can best be likened to a bad hangover morning-you kinda sleep it out. It took me 2 nights to watch this movie and I fell asleep before the first hour of it. I think maybe it was due to the immense amount of near-whisper lines that the characters had.<br /><br />To it's credit, the graphics are pretty decent CGI animation, but you can tell that the intense details of a great CGI just aren't there-maybe it was budget constraints after wasting money on great actors so that they could fall out of glory from this movie.<br /><br />In regards to 'sticking to the story of greek mythology', well that's a whopping F...but then again people are making movies like Abe Lincoln: Vampire Slayer (or whatever the movie is), so I do not think the departure from its source is a travesty given the current garbage floating around.
0439023521|5.0|I was trying to avoid reading this book due to it's in a genre (love story in a dark futuristic world) I normally try to avoid.  But my friend continued to push this book under my nose until I broke down and picked it up.  I must say after reading the first couple of chapters I am hooked and am really enjoying the story. So as penance to my friend I have to write this review as well as give the next book in the series a read.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Just when I thought we could not possibly make a movie about any old thing, in walks in \\"Into the Wild\\". This does not deserve to be a movie--it should have been a brief series on the Discovery channel and remained at a level of production no higher than that. I am not criticing the acting or the production quality of the film--I found not issues there. What I am speaking to is the necessity for this clear display of man undone to make it to the big screen. There are many other (and brighter) people who deserve to be chronicled in a movie. What did this person actually accomplish?! Nature is brutal. Nature is even more brutal when you decide to live in its realm unprepared. Another air breather bites the dust. Thank you Darwinism for weeding out the herd and thank you director for redefining my new low in movie-making...I place this moview right alonside 'Queen of the Damned'.

1781161097|4.0|This is a wonderful companion piece for fans of the film. The concept art, photos and other materials provide keen insight on the movie's production and the book itself is handsomely designed. That said, it could have benefitted from a little more behind the scenes (and final product) photography, especially chronicling key scenes including the climax. Cinefex's July 2012 issue has several such images that would have been great additions here: Fifield, the operating table, the grown alien, the crash, the Deacon, etc. (At the time of this writing, you can preview a few spreads here: [...] That said, I don't regret this purchase at all.

0765316994|5.0|\\"This is the part where you run and scream a lot.\\"<br /><br />Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Intrepid, a spaceship that has the reputation of killing off most of its non-essential crew. The captain and senior officers and one or two especially good-looking guys always come back from planetary \\"away\\" missions alive (though often mangled up a bit), but always, always, at least one, and often many more, of the crew is killed. When Dahl and a few other new recruits begin investigating, they discover that the statistics just don't work out right. There is definitely something weird going on. With the help of a computer hacker who hides in the bowels of the ship, they set out to get some answers and make a discovery that completely changes how they view the world.<br /><br />I'd love to tell you more about the clever plot of Redshirts, but I don't want to give it away. I hope it's enough to say that I was delighted from the first page and I laughed a lot. Redshirts is a spoof of Star Trek; the title refers to the ever-changing expendable red-shirted crewmen who go down to the planets with Kirk, Spock, Bones, et al., but usually don't return. Most Trekkies are sure to find it hilarious. Though Scalzi mocks Star Trek plot clich&eacute;s, there's a sincere sense of affection and nostalgia for Star Trek that I found charming. Also charming is the reminder that all those expendables have real lives, too.<br /><br />Redshirts is self-aware metafiction divided into three parts: a novel and three codas. While the novel is a comedy, the codas are meant to make us think about life and death and our place in the universe. The conceit starts to wear a little thin by the second coda, but rebounds for a gut-wrenching twist at the end. If you don't like metafiction, Redshirts may not be for you, though I'd encourage you to try it anyway, especially if you're a Star Trek fan.<br /><br />I listened to Audible Frontiers' audio production of Redshirts which was read by Wil Wheaton. I don't know if Wil Wheaton's narrations are always so good, because I've only heard him narrating novels written by John Scalzi, but let me just say that in my experience, Scalzi + Wheaton = a brilliant performance. Wil Wheaton totally \\"gets\\" John Scalzi's characters (and it's not just because he used to play an ensign on Star Trek). If you're an audio reader, you definitely want to read Redshirts in that format. If you're not an audio reader, Redshirts could convert you.on.

B004WCTLNY|5.0|Well acted and directed, this adaptation of Phillip K Dick's short story called<br />\\"The Adjustment Team\\" honors the concept of the original story with an added romantic subplot. Matt Damon is fine, though Emily Blunt runs circles around him with her huge variety of charms.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Book two is just as poorly written. Do, please, avert your eyes from this train wreck. There IS good erotica to be had... elsewhere. Trust me, it doesn't get better in this tome. There is no warming up to the poor writing, weak character development, insipid adverbs, or wonky British styling. This is one media phenomenon that makes me ashamed of our culture. I think the most interesting thing about this book is the disparity between the 5 star reviews and the one stars. The harmonious chorus of raving five-star-folks nearly all say they \\"don't read\\".(Why this is a badge of honor for a literary reviewer, even just in a peer setting is beyond me!) When you look to see what other kindle/amazon books they review, this is it. Just this one hyped up piece of pulp. Those of us on the other end of the reviewing spectrum do exercise our minds and have well written reviews of a variety of genres. So, if you are reading my review and feel inclined to leave a 1 star(wish amazon had a no star option!)review as well, I am looking forward to peeking into your other reviews and seeing what other books have caught your eye. This book's style, though some kind of mainstream wildfire, is a shameful commentary on how mediocre and lacking initiative the masses are. I don't think I will EVER trust a best-seller list again as a recommendation.  ***none of my reviews are paid for.

B0055S348W|3.0|This app has worked great for printing Office documents and Gmail messages up until today after an update which caused Word documents to come out garbled on my Canon MX340.  Since the update came from Google Play, I tried the Amazon apps version of PrinterShare, yes, paying twice for the same capability (desperate to print quickly and my printer is not supported by \\"The Cloud\\"). The Amazon version which I just downloaded works like the old Google Play release, that is, perfectly.  Android really needs printing integrated into the apps as it is in Windows and OS X.  Smart Office claims to have an integrated print capability, but it does not detect my wifi Canon MX340.  In short, I've tried \\"The Cloud\\" (Google's), SmartOffice, Docs-to-Go, Olive Office Premium, QuickOffice and Office Suite. Only PrinterShare has been consistently reliable thus far, but expect that to change as Android matures.

B004UFEJW6|3.0|Soldier was a bust at the box office that cost $60M to make but brought in only $14M domestically and was vilified by the critics (10% at Rotten Tomatoes). But because of terrific performances by lead actors Kurt Russell and Connie Nielson, it has become a cult classic.<br /><br />The film centers on a secret military program in the somewhat near future established (no nationality is mentioned) to recruit and indoctrinate soldiers at birth rather than at the age of majority. Despite numerous successes in a number of wars, the soldiers in the program are retired in favor of a new super-soldier program that genetically engineers its recruits rather than screening the naturally born. The noncom that is the lead soldier of the older unit (Russell) is cashiered and dumped on a remote colonial outworld outpost. He is rescued by the shipwrecked colonists and repays the favor when the same unit of super-soldiers stumbles across the colony by accident and tries to exterminate the colonists.<br /><br />This isn't the gritty and gutty military of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2002), but the glossy Hollywood military of Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997). No surprise really as the choreography is done by David Tattersall, responsible for the awful Star Wars Episodes 1-3 (1999-2005), Speed Racer (2008), and Gulliver's Travels (2011). Why is this a problem? Because Kurt Russell and supporting actors Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee, Jason Scott Lee, and most of the bit characters are playing it super straight and intense. When the foppish Jason Isaacs strolls in as the critically important character Colonel Mekum (the superior officer of the super-soldiers), the movie never quite recovers from the dichotomy between the two very different acting styles and cartoonish visuals.<br /><br />Downsides: The film's script bludgeons the viewer with self-indulgent pro- environment and anti-military morality. The sets have a silly Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome-style (1985) feel.  Combat sequences mostly consist of explosions and various stuntmen hurling through the air, arms and legs flailing--something out of a 70's or 80's era Chuck Norris action flick.<br /><br />Upsides: Kurt Russell and Connie Nielsen's performances. Russell plays an emotionally damaged soldier who has known nothing beyond fear and discipline. Nielson plays an empathetic colonist that tries to bridge the emotional gap. It is the scenes between the two where the movie really shines. Russell finds himself attracted to Nielsen in a raw fashion he is wholly unfamiliar with. He stares at her longingly, but uncomprehendingly, and locks up stiffly when Nielsen tries to hold him during a particularly emotional encounter. Nielsen, a married woman, finds herself attracted to the tough, resourceful, and hyper-masculine soldier. She struggles between her loyalties to her husband, her only son, and the hostile and insulated colonial community while still trying to protect Russell from a world he does not understand.<br /><br />It is Nielsen and Russell's performances in this film that earn it a third star (out of five) in this reviewer's opinion, elevating it above standard straight-to-video fare. In spite of all its shortcomings, the movie is engaging and entertaining and well worth the time to watch it.

B007KAJG3K|4.0|First let me say that no one seems to be happy with the relatively new Ultraviolet digital media format that much of Hollywood has adapted to. And I would say that most of the negative 1 & 2 star reviews here at Amazon for this movie are an outcry against said format. But in fairness, the average number of stars that this movie is getting is dramatically lower based on the outcry to this format that Hollywood has taken to versus the quality of the movie. So if you are considering this movie, that fact should be kept in mind as you decide whether or not to view. Anyway....<br /><br />Us old guys have all seen Basil Rathbone in the original Sherlock Holmes movies from the 1940s, right? When I was a kid in the early 70s they used to rerun them on Saturday mornings, and I must say that I found them intolerably boring. In 1939 Rathbone actually did the first called [[ASIN:B0001DCYBE The Hound of the Baskervilles]] in what became a series of over a dozen sequels with him in the lead role.<br /><br />To the preservationists who say that one should only re-make bad movies...not good ones...think this: One should re-make old good movies and make them as good or better. That's what Guy Ritchie's 2009 version of Sherlock Holmes accomplished, and it's what Ritchie accomplished here with A Game of Shadows.<br /><br />While the storyline of Ritchie's 2009 Holmes was a bit...well...remade, Game of Shadows was only slightly influenced by Conan Doyle's short story \\"The Final Problem\\".  All in all, Ritchie's Holmes movies give the classic franchise a beautiful 21st century treatment with good FX and cool scenery. They're full of action, along with a lot of clever dialogue that made the 2-hour length of the movies go by before I was ready for an end.<br /><br />I have seen quotes suggesting that Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is \\"a travesty to the character that Doyle created\\" and one particularly funny quote suggesting that \\"Robert Downey replacing Rathbone in Holmes was akin replacing Clark Gable with Eminem for a remake of Gone With the Wind.\\" But look, to me as long as the result is good I couldn't care less if a director takes liberties with what was originally created in print or on screen. I thought Downey made an excellent Holmes...but I doubt that I'd feel the same way with Eminem in Gone With the Wind. :-)<br /><br />I was not only pleased with the first two Sherlock Holmes efforts under Ritchie's direction, I was also thoroughly entertained. Action fans, don't pass on this. Preservationists, you probably won't be happy. And back in January 2012 it was announced on DeadlineHollywood that Ritchie will be back to direct a third sequel in the franchise.ark Gable with Eminem for a remake of Gone With the Wind.\\" But look, to me as long as the result is good I couldn't care less if a director takes liberties with what was originally created in print or on screen.

0393064476|3.0|Well, I was disappointed with THE SWERVE by the time I was a little over half-way through.  I think it would have been a better book if the author just told us the story of how the work of Lucretius was rediscovered and how it gained traction in the humanist movement.  Instead the book takes  on the character of a polemic pitting the scientific world-view against a religious world-view. In this day and age the science vs. religion debate has been re-energized by the politicization (if there is such a word) of the world-view of the religious right.  In as much as the religious right has effectively pressed their claim that only the people who agree with them are truly religious, they have effectively painted a huge bulls-eye on their backs for people who have an intelligent scientific view of the world.  That is really a shame, because, in fact, their are many people who live very comfortably in the world of faith and religion without having to deny the lessons of reason and science.<br /><br />It seems to me that THE SWERVE is fighting a battle against a religiosity that certainly existed in the 15th and 16th century and, perhaps, is echoed to some degree (a slight degree by comparison in my opinion - after all, as much as the religious right might like to burn heretics at the stake or dismember them in the town square they have not actually done that yet!) in our own time. However, this is a battle which most intelligent Christians are not that interested in fighting.  Religion and science are not mutually exclusive simply because they speak to two different dimensions of living.  Faith and reason are not polar opposites simply because they do not belong on the same scale of comparison.  Science is about what happens.  Faith is about how we respond.  Science creates atom bombs.  Faith creates peace treaties.  Science creates cures for cancer.  Faith creates the courage to live the years we are given by the cure.<br /><br />Lucretius' thought had a pivotal effect onthe creation of a scientific worldview, but it has not done much to usher in an age of reason and rationality in how humans relate to other humans.  There is good science in our world which has advanced our communal life far beyond Poggio's imagination.  But there is bad science which has enabled horrifically inhumane behavior from radiation poisoning to farming by pesticides to sterilization of people judged to be socially inferior.  There is good religion in the world which has inspired unimaginable acts of courage and beneficence from Dietrich Bonhoeffer to Sister Theresa to Martin Luther King.  But there is bad religion which has used fear to manipulate and suppress the human spirit and demonize whole communities of people.  Forget science vs. religion.  That battle is hopeless.  It is an utter waste of time and effort.  Both are good. Both are bad.  Leave it to pedants and self-aggrandizing intellects to fight that battle.<br /><br />Concentrate instead on reason and faith.  Not reason VERSES faith!  Reason and faith.  To live in the world a person needs both no less than a person needs both a mind and a heart (symbolically speaking).

0345803485|3.0|From the moment Anastasia literally falls into billionaire Christian Gray's office, he is intrigued. She is there for her friend who is ill to do an interview for the university's newspaper. He cannot get her out of his head, and visits her at work saying he was in town to go over some donations with the school. He is however interested in one thing only though, making Ana his in a BDSM contractual relationship. In the course of only a few weeks, he has seduced her and handed her a very thorough contract to look over. Ana has to admit the Christian that she is a virgin, and Christian realizes that he not only has to introduce her to the BDSM world but also vanilla sex as well. Hard and soft limits in place after Ana agrees to be his they spend time both in and out of his playroom. One night Ana asks how bad it could be and Christian pushes her with a brutal punishment session, which quickly makes her realize that she is not cut out for the BDSM world and she leaves. The book is very fast paced as far as the relationship is concerned and filled with very graphic descriptions of both their BDSM encounters and their \\"normal\\" sexual encounters, and you get the distinct impression that Christian Gray is more than a little damaged.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Gripping. Drawn out. Rushed. How can it be all three?  Gripping because of the 1st 2 books and needing to know what happened at the end.  Drawn out throughout the middle and the pursuit of the Capitol - seemed to go on forever with far more detail than the other books, with less progression.  Seemed like an attempt to fill pages of the final book.  The ending was thrown together and lacking all of the beauty, clever writing and depth that the 1st 2 books had. Having said this, still highly recommend reading all 3 - after the 1st 2, you have to know how it ends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Being that I once lived in real life as a submissive I have to say that Ana and Christian are very near what many Doms/Subs go threw in real life.  From wanting the playing part and needing it...(dom & Sub space-much like a runners adreniline high) along with the total effects that it gives the Dom & Sub to also wanting more out of the relationship.  It also shows that there isnt anyone that can really be 24/7 Dom/Sub and Ana and Christian show that the so called Vanilla part will forever keep creaping into your life style.  Out side influence from extended family also show that not everyone can have this kind of lifestyle all the time.  I believe this is a very well written fiction with some real trueth to what this world is all about and I look forward to starting book 2 this weekend.

0062073281|3.0|Reality Show! How much of you is real??<br />The series centers around 4 girls that couldn't be more different from each other, but they are all starring in the new Reality Show where they are being watched while trying to \\"make\\" it in Hollywood! The 4 girls are thrown together and each of them has to be careful to protect their life and their real self otherwise they would be eaten from the media. Some can do this better, some ..not so much! Still, they all struggle with being constantly filmed, trying to get their career going and still trying to remain a normal private life.<br /><br />Girls Are Girls!<br />I loved the diversity in the girls characters and although I thought I wouldn't be able to like Madison in the beginning - she grew on me while the story progressed and even managed to surprise my at the end! Gabriel, was the naive clueless girl, who is super gorgeous but a little dump - still I liked her although I didn't connect with her!<br />My two favorite girls were Carmen and Kate!!! Carmen comes from a super rich celebrity background and tried to get her own career going. But, she did all this with a heart and was farm from being an uptight, arrogant chick everyone expected her to be! She's was actually the best friend you would wish to have! I liked her instantly!<br />Kate was the girl from the country - but a truly talented musician! She was completely overwhelmed by everything and she was the girl easiest to make mistakes that could ruin her personality. She was cute, a little naive but positively genuine! Kate definitely was my favorite character!<br /><br />Love, Romance, Truth and Lies<br />With me being a big fan of romance, I was happy to find a cute love interest in Luke! Young, handsome actor with a cute accent! *swoons*! He was constantly where the girls where and even fell in love with one of them! I loved their sweet and cute growing relationship! But, it wouldn't be Hollywood if it would be that easy...<br />The plot was moving slowly and there was a lot of times when not so much was happening. It felt more of an introduction of all the girls, the boy and the whole idea of the series. Nevertheless I was entertained and I truly enjoyed the book despite it slow pace. A few twists and turns made it totally worth my time!<br />Bewitched Rating<br /><br />Bottom Line<br />The Fame Game was a great kick off into a new Contemporary series that will definitely stay on my Reading Pile! The Girls featured in this series are great with all character flaws and highlights that ensures an interesting mix and the promise of more drama, love, tears and friendship to come!

1439127700|5.0|This book describes the relationships between various presidents since Truman. It covers the interactions not only when these gentlemen were presidents, but before and after. It's a great book, first it is set against the backdrop of history and covers a good bit of it, secondly it traces these 1-1 relationships really well. A lot of interesting information that I previously did not know. Highly recommended.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is actually a really good tool.  It performs as expected and can be a life saver for those who need you to remote in.  The only drawback I have encountered so far is how you cannot control some programs when you remote in, not many though.<br /><br />Does not seem to have a desktop client though.<br /><br />To mea this as a strong second place to LogMeIn.  Very strong.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read and enjoyed King during his early years, but had given up on him of late.  A number of co-workers told me that this book was so good that they were actually sad when it was over.  So, I gave it a shot.  Having just finished the book, I have to say that I found it to be brilliantly conceived and written.  Though not typical of his genre, King is at the top of his game here.  The time travel concept is largely believable, and the mood/setting he paints of the 50's and early 60's is really fun.  This book made me think...themes like \\"the past is obdurate,\\" \\"the past harmonizes,\\" and \\"Richie from the ditchie and Bevie from the Levie\\" (you'll understand later) made this a hauntingly compelling read.  I can't recommend it more highly!

1608193381|1.0|I can not add much to Haringtons excellent review other than to add if you think this is a work of economics than you need to retake economics 101.  The author is firmly ensconced in the populist Krugman/Stiglitz model of economics for liberal dummies.  As a silly nonacademic work there is plenty of non-sequitor references to Bush and footnotes from esteemed economic statistical authorities like the New York Times and WP.  Its a silly book and, as has been pointed out, since the collapse of the USSR the author has nothing but vapid and banal suggestions based on feel good ideas to ameliorate his animus towards capitalism, or more exactly the straw man phoney capitalist policies he attempts to debunk.  This is the exact type of guy that will talk sh*t about America at every cocktail party, then take the first academic job in the States that offers him more money and prestige than they are paying him at Cambridge.  We have enough academic and news magazine econ hacks here in the USA, we certainly dont need this one too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm a picky reader. I love a good mystery. One that keeps me guessing. I didn't know what I was getting into for the first few chapters. The more I read, the more I was drawn into the novel. Gillian Flynn has a way with words and very good at her craft. Reading Gone Girl put me in the same room with the characters and watching from the sidelines. I couldn't put the book down.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|For all of the women who are raving over this book, please read \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" (1928 - D.H. Lawrence). Now, that novel will make you blush....<br />\\"Fifty Shades\\" is an amateurish attempt at best - I kept waiting for the long touted \\"good parts\\". Unfortunately, they never appeared - just page after page of teenaged angst. Will definitely not be buying into the sequels!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's Sharp Objects is disturbing, but a very good read. Her characters are so different. Another of her novels I couldn't put down. It's a recommended read.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Omg idk what all the technical difficulties with kindle fires and the app because it downloaded perfect for me and I have a kindle fire so good luck to everyone with kindle fires!!!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Ok, to answer your questions, 1. This is not a virus, scanned by AVG, and Norton. I also, checked the file system myself. 2. This does what it markets perfectly. It gives you opitions to download in 3 formats; AAC, MP3, and MP4.MP4 tends to download faster. The only issue I had was with the small amount of space I have on my kindle fire. So, I give this a 5 out of 5 for doing its job correctly.

B00871C09S|5.0|This terrific classic focusing on our fear of intimacy and tendency toward voyeurism is one of Hitchcock's most entertaining films. There are no crop dusters or other devices to provide the tension this time and it works in the film's favor. Rear Window is a more character-driven film and the suspense builds slowly into a bonafide thriller. Hitchcock understood that most people are more comfortable looking at the lives of others from a distance and explores this area of our personalities in a very enjoyable fashion.<br /><br />Jeff (Jimmy Stewart) is a professional photographer wheelchair bound after an accident while on assignment. Grace Kelly is his  icily beautiful and doting girlfriend, Lisa. Jeff is feeling claustrophobic, not only about his immobility but about his relationship with Lisa, whose patience and elegant charm as she tends to his needs and waits for him to ask her to marry him are put to the test. The no-nonsense practicality of his nurse Stella, winningly portrayed by Thelma Ritter, makes a fine contrast to Kelly. Jeff, stationary and bored to tears, begins secretly watching his neighbors across the courtyard through the lens of his camera, becoming involved in their plight as if following a daily soap opera; taking to heart their loneliness and finding great pleasure in their finer moments. But something darker begins to take shape when Jeff pieces together witnessed events in one of the apartments across the courtyard and comes to believe he is spying on a killer.<br /><br />Both Lisa and Jeff's policeman pal Lt. Doyle (Wendell Corey) think someone is letting their imagination run wild, at least in the beginning. Jeff's own disbelief and his girlfriend's early scorn begin to wane, morphing into an evermore dangerous pastime when Lisa becomes Jeff's legs. But the man who may have murdered his wife begins suspect that Jeff has seen too much, putting both their lives in danger. Hitchcock is marvelous here, using his own lens to show the voyeuristic inclination of us all, as Jeff's seemingly innocent means of passing the time from afar threatens to turn into a personal confrontation which he may not survive. Hitchcock deftly takes the viewer from a light and breezy beginning to a more concerned tone, until there is near panic, chiefly because we are all a bit voyeuristic, and can easily put ourselves in Jeff's situation.<br /><br />Like most of Hitchcock's films in Hollywood, it is a bit detached, but less so than others during this period, marking this as one of his finest. Raymond Burr as the possible murderer creates terror just by his glance across the courtyard at the spying Stewart, while Kelly and Ritter give this film its footing, making the events completely believable. Jimmy Stewart gives one of his finest performances, marvelously conveying the frustration of becoming suddenly immobile, which leads him to live vicariously through his neighbors' lives. A terrific film classic, perfect for a dark and stormy night with a big bowl of popcorn.inclination of us all, as Jeff's seemingly innocent means of passing the time from afar threatens to turn into a personal confrontation which he may not survive.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|I read a lot of the reviews regarding the pro's and con's of the AKG K702's. I have used them for monitoring during home recording and mixing in my home studio.  The headphones are incredibly accurate across the audio frequency range.  As a musician I don't want headphones to bias the actual sound of my instruments during recording, playback, or mixing.  The AKG's are worth the money considering their accuracy across the audio frequency range. I listened to the headphones and compared their response against my JBL reference monitors.  There was no difference in the frequency response, which includes a subwoofer, and the material sounded virtually the same in my opinion.  The bass response is reproduced accurately. Some consumers complained about the fit, but since they fit over my ears, they seem comfortable to me.  Of course fit and  frequency response accuracy are subjective, but the AKG K702's are working fine for me.  I chose them over \\"Beats\\" for their flat response vs the exaggerated bass response of the \\"Beats\\" headphones line.

B006M7JCC2|5.0|I have signed up for Hay House's book reviewer program at  [...], and my first review is of Anita Moorjani's Dying to Be Me. This book first came on my radar through a blog post from Danielle LaPorte; and since I have just had kidney cancer surgery in the past year, issues of death and mortality are still very much on my mind.    We get to know Anita long before her cancer diagnosis and see her struggle with resolving conflicts between Hindu cultural expectations and forging her own path, eventually establishing a fulfilling career and finding the love of her life. After a few peaceful years, Anita saw her best friend and her husband's brother-in-law go through painful chemotherapy and eventual death due to cancer. Then she discovered a lump on her shoulder. She is diagnosed with lymphoma and tries to figure out which alternative healing methods to use, but finds herself confused by conflicting theories.    Her health steadily declines, and after four years, she eventually ends up in the hospital, not expected to live through the night. Her near-death experience leads to an encounter with her father and her best friend, who had both passed on years before. She is given the chance to choose death or life. When she regains consciousness, the doctors soon discover her cancer has not only gone into remission, but even disappeared. She learns to let fear go and replace it with joy.    Even though I have never been sure I understand near-death experiences or even believe in them, I would definitely recommend reading this book if you can open your mind to beliefs that may challenge your own. I am not sure I believe that emotional or psychological triggers contribute to getting cancer. Can we reduce or eliminate our chances of getting sick by identifying those triggers? Maybe, maybe not.    I'd like to end this review by sharing part of Anita's answer to the question, \\"What's your opinion on service and serving others?\\" She says:  When service comes from the center of our being, it's the highest form of self-love. We know this is the case when we feel joy while serving. It will even feel light and fun! This uplifts both us and the recipient and helps to elevate the receiver's self-worth.    But if we perform out of an obligation or sense of duty, it feels serious and heavy and can be energy draining. This really doesn't do us any good, and it's not that great for the recipient either-especially if they can sense that we're acting out of obligation. This can make the recipient small and worthless.    In addition, when something comes from the center of our being, it's no longer an action-it becomes who we are. We don't need to think about it or work at it. We become an instrument for service to manifest on this planet. This is the difference between being of service and performing a service.    I hope we will all remember this in serving those with whom we come into contact.    FTC Disclosure: I received this book for free as part of the Hay House Book Nook review program. This review reflects my honest judgment of the product.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I looked at this and kinda scoffed thinking I'm not going to get addicted to this. it looks stupid. a good hour and a half later I realized that I was addicted. this game is so much fun. its the greatest thing since sliced bread :)

B00701L5XS|5.0|This is actually a pretty damn good app. It's got just about every knot I could think of and a bunch I've never heard of, and they use a really innovative way of teaching you how to tie them.    Now, about all this spyware noise:    Give me a break. Do any of you know anything about the Corona SDK? The permissions are built into it and can't be changed. Not ideal, but not a conspiracy to get at you and all your top-secret device activities.    And there's a big difference between ADWARE and SPYWARE, and when people confuse the two, it makes them look dumb and causes unnecessary issues for developers. AdKnowlege, et. al. for example (one of the alleged evil 'spyware' culprits) is an online advertising company that could (but doesn't in this case) collect anonymous info about your usage patterns. WHAT?! MY usage patterns?! Say it isn't so?! Guess what? They and 100 other companies do the same thing when you visit any one of thousands of websites where they display an ad and drop a cookie in your browser.    Here's my bottom line. Yes, spyware is evil; I'm not seeing spyware. The permissions that this app requires are explained in the App description - before you download it. And if you're really that concerned, take the time to research before ranting (this is the dev's site: [...])    And one more thing...Do a scan with Ad Ons Detector and see what kinds of permissions all of the other apps on your device have. If you want to be consistent, you'll have to delete most of them from your device.

B008EEWN6I|5.0|I applaud his moves in this work! He maintains a bold commitment to making an art of political expression while making a necessary mockery of some of the more ridiculous distractions in mainstream life. He is not afraid to shake anyone awake who is falling in love with the world we are \\"presented.\\" And anyone who follows Serj to his solo works should (by now) expect his bold, quirky expressions of popular culture and politics that can be profound, offensive, and hilarious all at once. The man is not afraid to express himself, and he does it for a cause... you cannot beat that... in my opinion... He is refreshingly honest. \\"Reality TV\\" is a needed slap in the face if anyone is dumbed down.<br /><br />Rhythmically I appreciate how he takes the familiarity of his voice and contrasts/weaves it around some very interesting audio textures... for example in \\"Ching Chime\\" you find an almost addictive syncopation. If you are a real listener you can hear some great texture in these songs. He uses some interesting electronic work in there that I really did not expect, but he pulls it off.<br /><br />You can tell Serj enjoys trying new things, you can hear it on this album and you can see it in his other projects. If you have watched his work over the years it is a cool way to see someone exploring their own creativity.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|I saw this digusting, wonderful, terrifying, and hilarious movie in it's first run way back in 1979 when I was 20. It was opening night for the film at the moore theater in The Seattle Film Festival. I remember going berserk along with the rest of the crowd - it was like a party! Well, here it is, 2012, and I'm 53 (sigh) - I just bought the boxed edition of this and friends, after 33 years this film still KICKS ASS! Get past some of the Disco Clothes and Hair, and you're in for the ride of your life! The film works on so many levels that I don't think thar the word GENIUS is overused here at all. It's got Gore, laughs, satire, a terriffic score, great acting, and is stuffed throughout with little goodies like the actual military, bikers riding through a shopping mall, some of the goriest special effects you'll ever see, but most of all, a great script, story, and acting. It's a solid film from the inside out and does not depend upon the effects to make it work. It also gives you 4 likeable characters that you want to survive, you care about them from the beginning. I'm turned off by most horror because they seem to be about and aimed at a teenage perspective. Not this one. I can't imagine how hard and delicate it must be to mix horror and humor and not undercut either one. This movie manages to do it better than anything else I've ever seen. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!

B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Ok. Let's start with the good points.  There are some pretty good fighting and killing scenes involving the wolves.  That's about it.  The film maker obviously detests the oil industry and those who work in the industry.  As a result, the oilmen are all a bunch of losers.  When the plane crashes, do the survivor's stay with the plane where people will be searching for them?  No, of course not.  The EVIL oil company won't spend money looking for them, so let's walk across Alaska in mid-winter instead.  Yeah, right.......  Needless to say, this idea was pretty stupid even without the pack of killer wolves.

B004EN8KE2|2.0|Have read the series on kindle.  Loved the books.  Strange as it may sound, I'm hungry for more and thought I would order the audio version and enjoy someone else reading the series to me.  However, sounds as though the reader is a horrible match for the books.  Nothing can ruin an audiobook more than a poor reader.  Instead of purchasing the audiobooks, I think I will try to check an audiobook from a library.  Thanks again!
0812973992|3.0|This is about as complex a novel as you're likely to find these days. That's not praise, exactly, but neither is it a complaint. It's about New York City in the grander perspective, probably why it was honored with a National Book Award.  And it's written disjointedly, in the stylish structure of Jonathan Franzen, David Foster Wallace, and Thomas Pynchon. Another thing in its favor in the book award sweepstakes.<br /><br />It begins with an Irish man looking for his brother in New York, the brother some sort of sidewalk saint, who, well, does what he can for the down and out. In an out of this story walk many characters: several hookers, some office workers, a Guatemalan nurse, a judge, and a high-wire daredevil, to name a few. The book's coherence, as much as it exists, concerns a man walking a tightrope between the two World Trade Centers, as New York collectively looks on. Incidentally, McCann's dialogue between the watchers is some of the most vivid I've read, and that's definitely a compliment. Imagining this guy's high wire act almost gave me vertigo.<br /><br />McCann juggles his memorable characters admirably, his dialogue is taut and evocative, and  his prose often sparkles. The pitfalls with this sort of story are those of coherence and detail. His strung-together story often hangs by a thread, but in the end, he makes it work. Still, all too often there are details to the book's goings-on, to the characters' lives that take us nowhere but deeper into minutiae. Maybe that's New York for ya.

0553801473|5.0|It  looks like a lot of others didn't like this or the fourth book. I did. I read all five in the last 8 or so months with a few breaks where I read 6 or so other books. Always loved getting back to these. Took a while to get into the fourth with new characters, but after I did, I had a hard time stopping.  Huge let down at the end of this one knowing I am going to have to wait a long time before I get another fix. But I guess I'll watch the HBO series in the meantime.  Hope the old man doesn't die before he finishes the series. Just wanted to submit the review to counter-balance the \\"haters\\".
B005FITIDC|5.0|Very touching real story! Even though I understand there is a certain time limit to fit in the whole life of Sam Childers in a movie, I still wish they would be able to tell us more about his sudden decision of becoming a Christian, and his initial stage of joy and/or struggles etc before he went on his missions trips. I was hoping to find out more about Sam Childers in the special features, unfortunately they didn't have much footage. Anyhow, it's really touching, and Gerard Butler's performance was just awesome. BRAVO to the producers, very brave in investing in a movie like this, it was't even showing in most of the major cinemas in Hong Kong hence I had to buy it online!
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I needed an inexpensive flash, mostly for fill. The re-cycle time was a  bit slow at times, but on the whole, it was perfect for my needs. And because it is Nikon, the unit has a stronger feel,it easily talks to the camera, it has a lockable metal shoe, and the flash can be angled up to 90 degrees. The photos had a nice color to them. It would be nice if it had a horizonal movement. It's size makes it easy to handle, but the small size means there are only 2 batteries.
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|There's always a risk with a movie like \\"The Artist\\" that it will become all about the gimmick and nothing more.  But Michel Hazanavicius's modern-day re-creation of a black-and-white silent film is so adroitly executed and artistically wrought that it transcends the gimmick and becomes an impressive work in its own right.<br /><br />Set in the late `20s and early `30s, the period when moviemaking was transitioning from silents to talkies, the movie focuses on George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a dapper matinee-idol who `s more devoted to his dog - the scene-stealing Uggie - than to his acting partner/wife (Penelope Ann Miller).  The problem is that Valentin seems more suited to the silent screen than the sound one - we learn why at the end - so we watch as his career and his personal life take a turn for the worse throughout the course of the story.  If that sounds a bit like the premise of \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" you're right, but the movie also has a touch of \\"A Star is Born\\" about it, for as Valentin's career goes into an ever-increasing death-spiral, the beautiful young ingenue (Berenice Bejo) he helped to discover has taken to the talkies like gang-busters and is becoming a major star of the silver screen.  (One can also find a couple of homages to \\"Citizen Kane,\\" but they're a little less obvious).<br /><br />\\"The Artist\\" is obviously of most interest to those with a love of cinema and movie history, as it re-creates in breathtakingly beautiful terms the look and sound of silent movies (the tinkling-piano score is by Ludovic Bource).  The movie is pure joy to look at, thanks to the eye-popping cinematography of Guillaume Schiffman, which captures the otherworldly elegance of a world framed in black-and-white images. The story may strike some as facile and simplistic to say the least, but that's clearly in keeping with the temper of the times and the era of motion picture history in which it is set.  I could have done with a little more of the behind-the-camera glimpses into old-time moviemaking and a little less of the foreground romance, but that is a minor quibble in a movie that works on so many other levels.  One of those is the acting, with Dujardin and Bejo managing to create effective characters with only a minimum of mugging, and John Goodman and James Cromwell doing the same in supporting roles.  And little Uggie, who also appeared in \\"Mr. Fix-it\\" and \\"Water for Elephants,\\" puts Toto and Rin Tin Tin to shame in the canine-acting division.<br /><br />With movies like \\"Moneyball,\\" \\"The Descendents\\" and \\"The Tree of Life\\" hanging around, I wouldn't have voted for \\"The Artist\\" as the Best Picture of 2011, but I wouldn't have missed the one-of-a-kind visual experience it affords for anything in the world.limpses into old-time moviemaking and a little less of the foreground romance, but that is a minor quibble in a movie that works on so many other levels.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|well to start off i got the books in paperback as a gift from my aunt. i never would have spent money on them because they just weren't  what i like 2 read. i am a diehard paranormal romance reader. i do however also like paranormal and normal erotica. from what i heard the book was full of kinky and erotic acts. so i went for it and read the first book. personally i thought it was a cute story. i laughed nd i cried. to me that means it was pretty good. my disappointment  came from all the vanilla sex. there really isnt any eroticism. there is talk about it but it just never really happens. so if u want a good romance this is pretty good. just dont read it because you think its going to be kinky.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|wow! this game is addictive and mad fun! also love the sound effects. great waiting-in-the-airport game. love it! cant wait to play! only downside: wish there was a solutions option.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|OUT OF MY HANDS truly sounds like an a-ha recording. It is rich and melodic both instrumentally and from the singularly distinctive voice of Morten Harket.  This CD is a surprise, a very pleasant one. How could those of us who have embraced a-ha all these years gone on without that voice, those never ending melodies.
B00005Y2EL|5.0|My personal opinion is that Thin Lizzy aged very gracefully. Bad Reputation through Renegade are the albums I have a tendency to listen to the most and this (Renegade) just might be my favorite. Word.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game to play to challenge your critical thinking. fun and easy to lose track of time while playing. try it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|as i sed before its good but not gr8. this kind of like a soap opera. wether you like it or not you want to see how it develops. so read on.....
B008MEM24S|1.0|I purchased it and then it says that there was an error.Dont waste your money like I did trying to see if it would actually work.I would give it a 0 stars but they wont let me.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|I just beat the 8th Colossus (about 3.5 hours of playing time) and am roughly halfway through, so I decided to write a quick review.<br /><br />Lets get the bad out of the way:<br /><br />1. This game has hands down the worst camera in all of gaming.  It literally is working against you most of the time.  The biggest problem is that the camera is constantly trying to reset to almost a panning-mode type of camera, rather than behind you.  This wouldn't have been the deal it is if there was an option to turn off the auto-reset camera position, but there is none.  Also, it \\"collides\\" with the environment and resets to a new angle which causes some disorientation.<br /><br />2. When using arrows, the switch to first-person is in the direction your body is facing, not the direction your head is looking.  This may sound weird, but if your running one way, but looking in another, if you bring up your bow it defaults to the way your running.  This is VERY jarring and disorienting and causes some delay when fighting the Colossus.<br /><br />3. Graphics.  An HD overhaul, really?  No way were textures recreated to HD resolution, rather just upscalled.  Graphics overall still look VERY PS2, just with widescreen support.<br /><br />4. Controlls in general.  They're not terrible, but they're not pick-up-and-play intuitive either.<br /><br />5. Very minimalist.  No backstory, nothing to do outside fighting Colossus, no weapon upgrades, etc.<br /><br />Now, the good:<br /><br />1. Colossus battles.  Its tough to put into words just how good the battles are, but here are some things that I love about them:<br /><br /> a. All start out as a puzzle and your required to figure out what to do to beat them.  This is very entertaining and perhaps the best part of the game.  If you take too long, the God will give you a hint, but I like the challenge of figuring out the beasties before a hint is given.<br /><br /> b. Some of the Colossus don't seem to necessary want to fight and are just going about their business till you happen along to try and kill them.  This makes them more both more realistic and almost majestic.  It really gives the whole world a living/breathing quality and really sucks you in.<br /><br /> c. Size of the Colossus.  Their size heightens the magnitude of the battles.  Really makes you feel like you're in an epic adventure.<br /><br />Thats about it.  The Colossus are really the best part of the game (obviously since there really is nothing else), but the battles are so good, compelling and engrossing that the game begs you to keep playing.  If only the above issues could've been fixed, we'd be looking at a 9-9.5 game.  But, its really more of an 8-8.5.  Still a rare game thats greater than the sum of its parts.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I love this app but I got a free color package and I went back to my one of my games AND IT WAS GONE! What a rip off! It NEVER said anything about only having it for a limited time!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was amazing. I read it for book club. It was spiritual and eye opening about human nature and our close-mindedness to labels and preconceived notions!! The story is a big slow going but if you can read between the lines you'll come out with more perspective than most people!! LOVE IT!!
B007Y2W44W|4.0|Needs to release this whole album as a Live DVD Concert with no holds barred and no if's ands or buts. That is all I have to say, The titles of the songs alone are mysterious in and of themselves. And that's what I like about this band. But I have many bands that I happen to like and love as do we all. I even got to go to the Final Sting tour of the Scorpions at the behest of a radio station and won 4 Comp tickets and had a fantastic time watching drummer James Kottak attack his drum kit with his Kottak Attack. The man was phenominal and I was watching him through binoculars.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|i totally enjoyed the whole thing once i got over the non-erotic concept. the romance between Ana and Christin was very sweet considering the hurdles they both had to overcome.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I recommend this game if u like mario... I'm a teenager and I still love it! if j get bored I play this! some levels r hard but not all of them r....
B004GYY714|5.0|I get to listen to whatever song I want all day long for free. Yessssssss! Aaaaaaah! Smile! :) :) :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series is one that you either get ino or you back off immediately.  It is not your common type romance story. I didn't know if I should feel guilty reading it or embrace my inner self.  I gave it the benefit and got with it!  In fact I have read all three books twice. I wanted to retread it after finishing the whole story.  I found wonderful humor especially in their e-mails along with a beautiful love story.  The coming together of two totally different individuals and how they found each other. If you can get over the sex parts (or through them) you will find a beautiful fairy tale of Cinderella and the handsome prince.  Everyone can embrace the child within and enjoy a beautiful love story!
B007NZDES0|5.0|I am very happy with my SADE concert DVD. It also came with a CD of the live concert, and it is still in my CD player in my car.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|A few days ago and watched it again today and what a fantastic re-telling and re-imaging of the legend of Conan (The first one with Arnold is classic) but this one was told as if if was reality based and has almost all of the elements of a warrior tale that I could imagine as well as the dark side of things. I enjoyed it immensely. And part 2 may be coming up soon in the next 2 to 3 years.
B00005JM02|5.0|Very excited to own this. I've watched it twice since buying. The buyer was the only one out there selling this movie, so I'm very glad this worked out. The product is everything I expected from it.
B00701L5XS|1.0|The economics of android app development must be that the ONLY way to make money is to sell private information?  which also explains why they are giving it away today for free on Amazon
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a terrific love story! One that draws you in and you are unable to put it down.  Yes there is sex sceens but the base line of the story over does the sex.<br /><br />Hoping she comes out with the story seen through Cristian's eye! Can't wait for more!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is an easy and fun game to play. the controls are simple and play is smooth. would recommend to anyone looking for a good solataire game to download.
B008MEM24S|3.0|well&hellip; I love Perry! I'm not sure if I should get it.  it looks fun, but I don't know if it's worth it.  idk?????????????????
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've tried a number of calculator apps but this one is the best. All the features you'd find in a real calculator, plus a few.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|Chronicle is a surprisingly entertaining action film that's in the \\"found footage\\" category (one of the film's characters is the camera man for the whole thing). The rough premise is 3 teenagers stumble across a possibly alien object that mysteriously gives them metal powers. As their powers grow things start to get crazy. I'll leave it at that for plot.<br /><br />The acting is great considering they're all relatively unknowns as far as I know. Chronicle is by far the most logical found footage film ever in that there's a sensible reason characters would be filming the whole time. The filmmakers also smartly employ a plot device to execute technical shots and get around too many shaky handheld shots (Cloverfield, I like you but you are very guilty of this). The action is really cool and (sort of spoiler) kind of reminds me of Akira at some points.<br /><br />Overall it's a terrific little gem and I think they could certainly expand the universe with a sequel. Hopefully it will be as well executed as the original.

B005MRME9G|5.0|I was satisfied with the quality of the packaging and the CD itself although when I put it into my computer all the track listings came up in Chinese AND English although the English titles were complete gibberish and had nothing to do with the actual title. Apart from this there was absolutely nothing wrong with the CD.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|My Mother and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie on Blu-ray.  The picture and audio are not bad.  Wish there were more special features.

034580404X|5.0|This book has the right amount of romance, drama and suspense. I recommend these books to everyone. Love love love!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|most games are really fun! can keep you busy for hours!! aweome free app!!! played on my kindle fire so far works great no issues
030758836X|2.0|The beginning of the book started quite well and ultimately it was a clever plot with a great twist.  This was also what kept me reading to the end. Unfortunately it was just badly written!  The characters were inconsistent and not very convincing.  Perhaps I should be less convinced in the future by the \\"NY times best seller\\" list and spend more time reading the reviews.
B003K16P3M|4.0|I was about to give up after reading several books recommended by Amazon. I was insulted that they thought so little of me and the quality of books that I deserved! I am so glad that I took a chance on Graceling, despite the YA description. While I can see the appeal for the YA audience (and I'm not sure I'm ready to give up my place there, no matter what my birthday says) I would definitely recommend this to other 20-somethings. Like previous reviews have stated, there is some romance and even a hint of intimacy. I probably wouldn't love the idea of my daughter reading this at age 14, but 15 or 16 would be fine with me. It doesn't make you uncomfortable or embarassed to read and there aren't too many details. You get the feeling that the few scenes that do involve intimacy were actually put there for plot purposes which isn't always the case in other novels. Sometimes I felt that the story moved a little slow for my taste, but the plot was extremely refreshing and unique. If you are tired of the same old Twilight/Hunger Games rip-offs, I would definitely give Graceling a chance. You will, more likely than not, find yourself pleasantly surprised.
B001IF252C|5.0|I have this adapter connected to a late 2009 Mac Mini and have used several different monitors without any problems at all.  I don't have an Apple monitor and have never tried to use it with one.  Just plug it up and it runs perfectly!

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Its very relaxing and calm. I sometimes use the background music while sleeping. its that addictive.<br />Its not for small smartphones. I use a kindle fire and htc evo.
0345803485|2.0|I bought this book given all the hype that surrounds it but it was quite disappointing. The book is boring and the characters are poorly outlined. The bits and pieces of information revealed about Cristian are so badly done, that you finish the book with little to no sense about the protagonist. I am in no way intrigued to read book 2 and 3. In spite of the poor prose and the repetitive nature of the writing, it is a page turner. I read it in a day, but more because i wanted to finish it.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really enjoyed this game when I first downloaded it. recently it has started to lag REALLY bad. I hope it gets fixed soon.
B00701L5XS|4.0|this app is a great start into knots, it includes all the basics and gives a simple write -up on each. the animations are alright, many times there is more than one way to tie a knot but here you are only provided with one way. I do hope the developer adds knots, this is a handy resource!
B00701L5XS|2.0|I really wish I had an app like this for when I was a boy scout, as learning how to tie a knot via handbook didn't always have good enough illustration to teach, and I would have to be in the presence of my Scoutmaster to really hone my knot-tying skills.  Lo and behold, boy scouts and camping enthusiasts can learn things much better and easier with this app!<br /><br />So why only three stars?  It goes way overboard on permissions, and I have to automatically deduct 1 star for OpenFeint (I wish that company would go the way of the dodo already, seriously), 1 star for network permissions, and 1 more because it just feels right.  Permissions notwithstanding, this is a five-star app, and I will definitely give it such a rating if and when the developers remove the unnecessary fluff.
B008MEM24S|5.0|so worth a dollar and really awesome this game is so fun I would recamend this game to any one
B007J4T2G8|5.0|In my humble opinion this was one of the best reads Ive had in such a long time. Also I read all 3 books in one week.
B0053O89JM|2.0|After having watched season eight, I was thoroughly disappointed. The caliber of writing was dumbed down to cheap jokes, hookers and lost the intelligence and brilliance that once made this aging show shine. Storylines were not followed through properly or were just hastily dropped. As much as I love Hugh Laurie, he just wasn't given the material this season to really showcase his acting capabilities as had been the case in previous seasons, even \\"Twenty Vicodin\\" fell short of that goal. The arc at the end of the season was overplayed and overamplified in a last ditch attempt to add some melodrama. What made it more disappointing was that it focused more on Wilson than House, which was off-putting as the show crawled to a close.<br /><br />I did make a valiant effort to try and embrace the changes (both the expected and unexpected)but something continued to feel off for me.(The loss of Lisa Edelstein as Cuddy was a presence very much missed and basically served as the giant elephant in the room for the entire season.) The show just lost its overall spark and appeal and fell terribly short for me. The new characters added to this season reduced the show to an unfortunate grade of \\"C\\" in my opinion, as Charlene Yi's lack of acting abilities were blatantly obvious and Odette Annable's inability to add nothing of substance to her character was just frustrating. There were a few good episodes in the bunch, but overall it was a lackluster season. Even the finale was a bit of a disappointment as it was far from an original concept.(Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be shaking his head.) It was almost a recycling of previous ideas the show displayed to garner interest with the addition of borrowing a page from the writer of Sherlock Holmes himself. Frankly, I found the retrospective \\"Swan Song\\" to have been far more interesting than the finale. Of course, Hugh Laurie produced the retrospective so there was no surprise that it would be better than the finale.<br /><br />This willbe the first season season set of the series that I don't jump to buy right when it's released. I'll probably wait a year when the price drops drastically to what the season was really worth and even that will still be more than I'm willing to pay. Alas, I have all seasons though and I'll probably complete the set without ever opening it or watching it, because there is nothing worth re-watching in season eight for this avid viewer. It's sad, because I was addicted to this show and loved it so much. Unfortunately, the \\"House\\" began to crumble mid-season seven and collapsed completely in season eight. Definitely not worth the money you're going to pay when it gets released.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The final book in this Trilogy just didn't do it for me like the first 2.  You have to read it though to see how it ends.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Like many of the reviewers, I'm a long-time Rush fan, and I was excited about this release since Snakes and Arrows was such a relief from the bludgeoning Vapor Trails.  Unfortunately, this album, suffers from several major problems: (1) the songs are too long, (2) the concept is cryptic, (3) the lyrics are depressing, (4) the melodic hooks seem limited to Alex's guitar solos, (5) the album cover is dreadful, and worst of all, (6) the production is muddy and hard on the ears.  I wanted to like this album, I really did, but The Anarachist and The Garden are the only songs I go back to, mostly because portions of the former remind me of Permanent Waves-era Rush, and the latter because of Alex's guitar work.  I'm giving it three stars because Rush at their worst is better than most bands at their best, and I think they were trying to work outside of their comfort zone a bit.  I do think the guys still have some spark left in them - here's to hoping they pick a different producer next time.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I was reading all of the rave reviews for Gillian Flynn's novel \\"Gone Girl\\" and I had never read any of her work so I picked up this opne until the other was released.  I enjoyed it but unlike \\"Gone Girl\\", which I have read and loved, this one didn't have such memorable characters and an intriguing premise.  Still worth reading, however, and has made me look forward to reading Gillian's next new book!
B00006AW63|1.0|I was so happy to receive this on DVD. It is one of my favorite movies. When I tried to watch on TV, it would not play. An error message came up saying \\"Playback prohibited by area limitations.\\" I am able to watch it on my computer but not my TV. Very disappointing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is amazing you can actually play this game for hours instead of ten min at a time I recommend. this game
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Full Disclosure: I don't know all that much about the difference between high-end and middle-of-the-road Blu-ray players, so maybe my ignorance is to blame.  In that case, take the review with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Also, ***spoilers below***.<br /><br />The Film: I don't know what people expect from movies - I don't know exactly how some people can think this is a 5 star movie while others think it's the worst thing ever made.  That just seems implausible.  But there's no accounting for taste, I suppose.  For me, this is what good action movies are like.  There are very few frills, the pace is a dead sprint after the initial set up, and there isn't anything in the story to get in the way of the action.  This is an action movie, right?  Maybe you want something different...in that case this movie isn't for you.  I don't think you're wrong.  I don't think you have bad taste.  I just like simple, straight forward action movies.  That's what Taken is, as far as I can tell.<br />Is Liam a good guy?  I don't know.  Not all movies are about good guys vs. bad guys.  Some movies are about a slightly-past-his-prime bad ass who wants his daughter back.  Oh, that's this movie.  Do you have to suspend disbelief throughout...yes...but...that's what movies are about, right?  By the end of the movie Liam's character is limping, stabbed, bruised, and exhausted.  Is it TOTALLY believable?  No, of course not.  If it were totally believable the movie would have ended with Liam heading home never to see his daughter again, probably only after the US negotiated for his release from French prison for running amok, etc.  Do you want to see that movie?  I don't.<br /><br />So, the movie is simple and linear.  Ex-preventer bad ass Neeson goes and gets his daughter back leaving a trail of bodies in his wake.  Either that's your cup of tea or it isn't.<br /><br />So, why the 4 star rating?  Well, the Blu-ray didn't want to cooperate with my player.  The super-impressive and action-packedmenus apparently overwhelm my bottom of the heap Blu-ray player.  Call me crazy, but it seems like a blu-ray release should play on the lowest common denominator.  The movie looks and sounds great once my player grunts and slogs through the menus and gets started, but it took like 20 minutes - no kidding.  Someone please tell me that it's my player for sure and I will sort that out.  Until that time, though, I'm calling the blu-ray release a stinker.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really did enjoy this book! I would have rated it 5 stars, but some of the sex scenes were a little redundant.  Besides that little issue, the book is highly addictive once you get past all the sex; there is a real story behind the man and woman.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Concise, straight forward, and thorough to say the least. Mike dials in and gives you the meat of the sport without all the unnecessary packaging. Give it your time and focus and he can get you where you are trying to be.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm glad to see that this book has caught on, and is climbing the charts. It has good characterization and good pace. I found it hard to put down, but when I had to it was very easy to become engrossed again when I got back to it!

0446567329|3.0|I find it hard to review this one. I liked the book, and I cried while reading. So there was an emotional attachment, but it just wasn't an unforgettable book for me. It was kind of like fodder - just there to pass the time. I hate to say that about it, because I did enjoy it. I just missed something with this one. I haven't seen the movie yet, so I didn't have a disconnect because it didn't follow the movie or vice versa. Maybe as time passes I'll be able to figure it out. But on with the review...<br /><br />I really liked Savannah. John was an ok character but I just got the \\"dumb jock\\" sterotype stuck in my head and couldn't get past that with him. I don't know they the jock thing stuck, since he was in the Army, but that's what stuck. Even when he was being a sweetheart I didn't see it as being realistic. Savannah was so caring and had such a big heart, but she also knew she had to take care of her heart and wouldn't let herself get hurt. I could see her falling in love with John, but I also could see that it would be short lived. They were two different people and he didn't really suit her.<br /><br />I would have liked to have had more about John's father, as I think he was the \\"sweetheart\\" influence on John. Maybe if he'd been a little bit more developed and a bigger part of the story then I wouldn't have had the negative view of John and his ability to be a anything but cool hearted. Through the whole book I just felt like John's emotions were a bit distant, I know he didn't want to \\"show\\" his emotions but everyone has emotions whether they like it or not. So I would have liked to see more of John's dad and John's emotions.<br /><br />I was also kind of disappointed at the end. There was a big build up and no real resolution. I am going to watch the movie. I've heard it's pretty different from the book and that it's one of the few movies that is better than the book.<br /><br />I will read more of Sparks' novels because I do like a good love story. Other's of his that I've read were really good. So I think maybe this one was just a fluke!of his that I've read were really good. So I think maybe this one was just a fluke!
034580404X|3.0|As a book it is okay-ish. But I cannot imagine any top actress accepting the role of Ana.<br />Many would want Megan-Fox or Brangolina (but no Pitt approval!)
0440243688|4.0|Lee Child is back -- bigger, better and meaner than ever.<br /><br />After the disappointing NOTHING TO LOSE, this Jack Reacher thriller gets back on track from the opening gripping scenes in the New York subway system to its rivetting climax. Child writes with sparse language, no words wasted, but plenty of bad guys killed.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one and look forward to reading the next one 61 HOURS.<br /><br />The only slight quibble I have with this book is the ending. Reacher fights his way through a slew of bad guys to get to the villains, but is fast running out of his limited ammo. He is out of bullets at the end and is forced into a knife fight. But he has killed several men armed with guns along the way. Why didn't he just pick up one or more of their guns when he knew his ammo was low?<br /><br />I guess only Lee Child knows the answer to that question.<br /><br />Still an exciting and gripping read.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun idea with lots of replayability,  this is a great free game.  I haven't seen an ad yet,  they rely on in-game gold purchases, but buying gold isn't necessary to enjoying this game.  Simple,  but cool game.
B00701L5XS|4.0|app itself is solid. very nice. if you look app up on Google Play, there is a link that explains the permissions, which explains how it's NOT spyware. only thing is that more variety of knots would be nice -hopefully more knots will come with future updates.
B005ZOCF5E|3.0|I am a huge fan of Reynolds'. I buy all of his books, and like any other good writer, he's mostly hits with some absolute gems (Revelation Space, Chasm City, Century Rain), some epic misses (Absolution Gap) and a number of good books overall. This one is entertaining, but not his best.<br />In Chasm City, he displayed great talent in weaving 3 different stories and maintaining them coherent, entertaining, and easy to follow. In \\"Blue\\" we have to follow different characters running around Earth and the Solar System, with several different factions and individuals each with its agenda and back story, sometimes double crossing each other and switching sides. Unfortunately, I didn't think he was very successful, there were too many of them, and it was hard to keep track. I think the book could have done with a less intricate plot.<br />The world Reynolds creates as background to the Revelation Space series is complex enough to give it marvelous depth, but simple enough to follow, and new aspects are revealed slowly enough to digest in the course of the various books. In \\"Blue\\" he just crams too much stuff into one book, giving a bit of an overload of gadgetry. Coupled with the overly intricate plot, following the whole thing becomes a feat of mental gymnastics.<br />Having said that, the book is still fairly entertaining, of far reaching scope and great depth and detail. I am still a huge fan of Reynolds' work and I will be looking forward to his next book.
B00384KM0I|5.0|Very prompt delivery in perfect condition - truly love the movie and the human prespective on racial bias.  Skin color does not matter - the person does.  I purchased this video from after watching it on TV.  I highly recommend it.<br />'
0486274268|5.0|Great book to have for people who are interested in drawing animals or fantasy creatures --either realistically or cartoony. I bought it so I could understand the animal anatomy more so I could draw taurs (beings that are half-human, half-animals.)<br /><br />The delivery was prompt and the book was new and well-packaged.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|this is my first rigg, so far i have no graphics card yet, but this little processor can take all my daily business and even my more heavy business (3d design, gaming) without a sweat. ok i lied about the \\"without a sweat\\", i mean, the processor never slows down or loses efficiency, it's a pretty powerfull monster! but it overheats sooooooo fast. as soon as i turn my PC on, my BIOS shows the CPU at 47 degrees Celsius, and while i do use my heaviest softwares, the system sends an annoying beeping sound that tells me: \\"yo dude, CPU is about to melt\\". Don't worry, CPU won't die, if it ever gets too close to that, it's just simply going to shut down. The biggest highlight is the whole 8-core thing, I mean, it is pretty darn awesome, my processor might be running at 16% (that's as high as it gets while using itunes, casual gaming and rendering high-poly 3d characters) but each individual core is barely at 2%. If you want AMD processor, get this one!!! (change the stock CPU cooler)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its like a mix of Oregon trail with cityville. I just wish that I didn't have to wait so long for more energy.
0061537969|5.0|Love this book!  I love dogs.  I love family.  And I loved the whole thing!  I don't want to give away the ending or specific details, but it makes you wonder about past/future lives.  What makes us intuitive?  Do we really know people?  You can't help but love Enzo, the dog.  I already passed the book on to my best friend to read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect!  I love the big numbers.<br />This app was exactly what I was looking for.  I needed a simple,  easy to use calculator. The fact that it is specifically. fir Kindle Fire made it easy to choose!
0345803485|1.0|I tried to read Fifty Shades of Grey, but I had to stop, it's that bad.  This is in no way, shape or form a true bdsm story.  A true Sub does what her Master tells her...end of story.  I know, because I am one.  This is a lovely little fairy tale, but it is just so obvious that this author knows nothing about the bdsm world.
0307970299|5.0|I am turning 50 (male) in August 2012 and also going camping for my birthday in Colorado. Was searching camping gear books and this title popped up. I like audio books so I ordered it.<br /><br />It maybe with the 50 coming up this book struck a chord with me. The lesson I took from this book is \\"Life Is A Journey\\".<br /><br />Yes Sheryl was unprepared for her backpacking trip but it is inspiring that she stuck it out. This trip did change her as it would anyone really.<br /><br />I recommend it highly to anyone that feels challenged and wants to be inspired and feel good.
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|I was honestly floored when I saw critics call this film \\"unrealistic\\" due to the fact that everyone seems to trust Esther (the psychopath homicidal girl) over her truth-telling but seemingly paranoid mother and a typical \\"It's always the parents' fault, not the child's\\" incompetent but far-from-uncommon therapist. Most horror films suffer from intense unbelievability, but this is definitely not one of them. It's only because *we* see the truth do we wonder how everyone can believe Esther over her mother. What no one seems to grasp is that they *WANT* to believe what they say, and the motivations every character has are definitely not unreasonable--if they took the mother's word, they'd be jumping into blaming the child for such horrific things, and it would almost invariably end in a downward spiral that would tear an already-salvaged family apart.<br /><br />I was impressed with the realism of every character. They even use the pathology \\"antisocial personality disorder\\" properly, and a totally believable family therapist who, like many other incompetent therapists, immediately blames the parents, not the children, for their problems. A therapist blaming the mother for her child's behavior is par for the course for many of these therapists, despite any and all evidence that the child is simply unruly, even with events that happen because of Esther.<br /><br />The two biological family members, Max and Daniel, have been criticized for being unrealistic, for not talking after seeing Esther do such horrific things. This is a mistake by critics. These are young children we're talking about who are, naturally, terrified of Esther, who threatens them with such intimidation that they don't care about anything except keeping her away from them, which means keeping quiet under any and all circumstances. Such young children can't understand that type of situation and the seriousness of it, and I really don't think it's such a stretch to say they would do the simplest thingand avoid Esther entirely so they don't get hurt, rather than tell someone and risk Esther doing the terrifying things she says she'll do if they talk. If she said the same things to adults, their thinking would be more adult-like, but they're very small children not even in puberty.<br /><br />Esther is also not an unbelievable character, and everyone's unwillingness to blame her despite that she *probably* had something to do with all of the happenings around her is perfectly natural. And the reason for that is because there's really no *actual* evidence that she was involved, and it would be unfair to blame an otherwise well-behaved child, and an orphan with a troubled past, at that. No one would be comfortable going against the quick consensus that the mother is just transferring her own guilt onto Esther. Not even her husband would be able to get past that in the real world. In terms of credibility, Esther simply wins by a landside. The mother is a recovering alcoholic and has periods of mental instability. Esther is a well-behaved, intelligent, and creative orphan who simply knows how to manipulate others behind their backs. She knows that they'll blame the mother the more she complains about Esther for things she can't find real evidence for. Esther is smart. The mother has no chance of winning the credibility war with no real evidence against Esther.<br /><br />Anyway, people who are complaining about how there's no way Esther could do the things she does and also that other kids would cover for her out of fear are mistaken. None of that is unrealistic given the context. The mother already starts off as someone to be watched for instability, and already lacks credibility before they even take Esther in. When her mother insists Esther is responsible for the bizarre happenings going on, we're talking about a not-so-perfect unstable mother against a well-behaved, creative child who knows exactly how to cover her own tracks, and in fact likes that her mother isso enraged about it, which only helps her own stability come off as credible.<br /><br />This is really an excellent thriller, one of my favorites. Esther is a true psychopath to the letter, and the way the film treats the nature of psychopathy is exceptional. It's a believable story, and the two hours rocket by while we watch Esther's psychopathy manifest more and more, and the suspense never lets up. Extremely highly recommended for horror and thriller fans.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was interesting, but not well written. There have been many well written romance novels and this one would not even make the top of the list.  However, given the media hype I can understand why the book is so popular.
034580404X|1.0|Wow. Where to begin. Is the world at large who loves this book on crack? haha.<br />I wish I'd taken two minutes to stop and read the bad reviews (i.e. Accurate ones) on here before I bothered to waste my time reading these. On the other hand, I knew 15 minutes into the first book they were crap, and I kept reading anyway. Somehow I thought that it'd get better. I didn't want to believe that all three books were THIS badly written and put together, it couldn't be? Right?!<br />WRONG.<br />I bought into the hype and read Twilight as well, and as irritating as Bella and Edward were, they were NOTHING like these characters. If I could have jumped into a book in a physical sense and strangled a character, it would have been Anastasia Steele. She is hands down, the worst written, most annoying and idiotic \\"person\\" ever conceived.<br />I find it somehow hard to picture someone who was supposed to be well schooled, wants to be an editor and whatnot, using phrases like she does every 10 words. Because everything this \\"woman\\" says it preceded with \\"Holy sh*$!\\", \\"Holy F#$*\\", \\"He's so HOT\\"....etc. Oh, and really... \\"Laters, Baby\\"? lol *eyeroll* Did Paris Hilton write this? Or just some 15 year old? Because that's what it reads like!<br />Regardless of this starting out as a Twilight fan-fic, there's no excuse in my mind for writing this bad to be put into print. It was horribly predictable, and the same things happen over and over again. Don't get me wrong, I've read some of the cheesy Harlequin romance junk, and it's better than this. The sex scenes in here are just laughable to me.<br />I'd say if you haven't already wasted precious time, don't read these.<br />I'd say the author should be ashamed of themselves for subjecting the world to this...but I'm sure the piles of money they're now sleeping on due to all this \\"success\\" will console them as far as being a joke as an author.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|I like the concept of the product. However, the rattle noise it makes is to  low for baby to hear unless its really quiet. Unfortunately, these socks do not have much stretch to them.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this game. It is so addicting that I have caught myself making excuses for not cleaning or some other necessary chore just so I could play CrossMe.  Want to buy the color edition but $5 is a little steep for me.  Guess I'll have to wait until the price comes down.  Hope it's soon because I'm almost finished all of the puzzles on this version.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was a bit skeptical on the series, but decided I had to read after all of the reviews. I loved book one and book two, but book three was horrific. It felt rushed.  We leave the last book hanging with Jack Hyde, and the engagement- LOTS,and I do STRESS lots to go with there!!!  However, BAM! - second book they were already married and the author flashed to points that led them to their marriage. I have never been more disappointed in a series book as I was with this book.This was a total let down to the series.  Can we say \\"cash in my pocket\\" is worth more than continuing what started to be a great series?!

061891868X|3.0|I do not believe in String Theory. The genius of Einstein was that his brilliant ideas lent themselves to immediate real world experiments and verfication. Methinks string theorists have jumped off the deepend into a hopeless phantasmagoric mire of might-be, may-be, could-be's. Theorists seem to be a dime a dozen. We might have to wait another century for another genius.

B004G6009U|5.0|This product works perfectly. I've only tested the BluRay disc but it worked great! No scratches and the whole DVD (case and all) was like new. Great seller! I will definitely shop here again.
0439023521|5.0|I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, quick read also.  I found it easy to understand and a bit violent for young readers,  I'd say 12 and over. I was stoked when the movie came out.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|It is hard to go wrong with a Tarantino movie.  He blends drama, suspense, gore and humor together and as always it works.  Even though it is a bit drawn out and the ending is a bit contrived it will keep your interest and if you like a Tarantino, you'll like this one.  The acting was first rate,
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I wanted to know what all the fuss was about....and now I still don't know - maybe a combination of poor writing, limited vocabulary, unimaginative descriptions (of  sexual encounters over and over again) and characters I feel absolutely no connection with.

B006VA3ZT6|2.0|I really liked the first season, but at the end of the season they announce WW1, now it is too much of a war drama and I lost intrest. I do not care to see trenches and explosions. I hate action films.
0439023513|5.0|This book is amazing!  Really draws you in - I couldn't put it down.  Definitely my favorite trilogy.  Worth reading whether you've seen the first movie or not.
1579128149|4.0|Being a chemical engineer I picked this book up mostly for the pictures, not so much for the writing. And I'm glad I did. The pictures are excellent, it's very interesting seeing some of the elements I work with in compounds sitting in their natural forms even if they're in minerals.<br /><br />The writing for this book is definitely aimed for the general public and anyone who has a history in chemistry probably wont find much interesting with it. Some of the writing I found to be incredibly amatuer for the type of book this is.<br /><br />It's an excellent picture book to flip through, and would be a really great way for a 'scientist parent' to get their kid interested in the field.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a smooth relaxing game<br />I enjoy playing it in my free time<br />my kids and grandkids love playing as well
B000001FO4|4.0|they are close but they are more blue's infused than any other rock band out there.  I saw them in San Antonio last night and their live show, sound and setlist were over the top and impressive.
