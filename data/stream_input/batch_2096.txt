B00AE2J93I|4.0|Movie wasnt as good as I had expected it to be.  It was worth watching once.  Loved the convenience of it being here.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have played a few games and enjoyed them all!  I try not to play too many, though, too addictive and a time killer!  LOL  Good stuff so far!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, I got it on my kindle for android, download was very easy, and the book was a real page turner, enjoyed it from the beginning. Leo the hero, who in the beginning you don't really like turns out to be the smarts of all the agents in a country where discipline and cruelty were the norm.  Tom Rob Smith does an excellent job in showing you what it would have been like to have a conscience in 1956 in the Soviet union.  I couldn't stop reading it and have now downloaded the sequel  The Secret Speech, following Leo again.  Great read, you will enjoy if you like history and suspence.
0765325950|4.0|I am pleased that this is completed. Many questions were left unanswered, but I consider the core story is completed satisfactorily.
B007SGM084|5.0|If you look romance this is the book for you, if you are open to ideas this is also the book for you, if you like adventure go for it reading the book.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|My only complaint with this story that it took forever just to figure out what is was about.  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't read it or watched the movie...but over all it was quite thought provoking and well written.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book is easy to read and involves you emotionally and intellectually.  It raises important questions regarding<br />nature vs. nurture and their impact on who we are and how we act.  Also, enjoyed the insight into the strategies and tactics used by prosecutors and defense attorneys.  Don't miss it...provides interesting questions for book club discussions.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is useful and the display has everything I want it to have on one screen.  It is easy to see and if you upgrade for just a couple of bucks you can get more looks.  I like this one fine so no need to upgrade for me but the other looks are cool as well.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|It takes just a little getting use to but I love the graphics &amp; movement of it. One of the best games I've come across.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|This may leave you morally unsure of who you should support, but that was the point that I believe Eastwood, Hackman, and company were trying to illustrate.  Eastwood took his &#34;man with no name&#34; character and turned him into a widowed father with a house full of kids and a soul full of regret.  It has the power to make you ponder all the bloody shoot-em-ups you have ever watched, western or otherwise, and the human price that is paid in the exercise of violence.  To quote the Schofield Kid, &#34;I keep thinking how he ain't ever gonna breath no more.&#34;
B005LAII80|5.0|Movie was great, lots of action, nice copy & story line all my friends enjoyed his sarcasm. I would recommend this movie for everyone to see except minors of course
B000N4SHOE|3.0|It's not a bad movie -- pretty good, actually, if you like gentle, chastely romantic period pieces (and I don't mean that in a snarky way). There are several truly fine actors in it: the always-surprising Emily Watson, who here brings life to what would have been a boring, shallow character; Ewan McGregor, utterly charming and looking strikingly like the real Norman Warne; Bill Paterson, bringing warmth and subtle suggestions of complexity to the screen as Beatrix Potter's father; even David Bamber works his magic in a tiny role that arguably wastes his talents. There are, of course, all those lush Edwardian details that are so easy to love -- the clothes, the furniture, the achingly elaborate dining services. You can't go wrong with those delicious glimpses of English countryside, which are far too few if you ask me. And then there are Beatrix Potter's delicately beautiful, whimsical watercolor illustrations, which provide some delightful (and heartwrenching) scenes.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Beatrix Potter's stories and artwork since I was a little girl; that's why I got this movie. Alas, I should have stuck with the excellent BBC animated series \\"Peter Rabbit and Friends\\", as that brought to life her work and spirit better than this respectable but tepid period piece.<br /><br />I am annoyed, annoyed, annoyed by the vague, wifty feminism that peters in and out of this movie. It's all been done and done again, it all felt so tired. It drifts in wearily at the very beginning, where Renee Zellweger's voiceover (God, I hate voiceovers) wryly remarks on how there are definite ways that respectable 32-year-old spinsters are supposed to behave and they don't include doing ... whatever the heroine of whatever period piece happens to be doing at the given filmed moment. This sentiment is punctuated by the notably sour and sniffy Mr. Warne, too obviously disliking Peter Rabbit, asking Beatrix if she is a Miss or a Missus and hastily auto-correcting himself to \\"Miss\\" with the muttered aside, \\"Silly of me\\", for of course no married lady would behave as she does. Although she pretty much just told us not five minutes ago that unmarried ladies don't behave that way, either.<br /><br />This suffocating little scene (made bearable by the quivering nostrils and inimitable expressions of delicate disdain on the face of David Bamber) ends with Miss Potter's trumpeting but restrained command to her footman (?) to drive her through not one London park, but all the parks (a stunning proposition indeed!), and faster, faster! We see the coach \\"speeding\\" through Kensington Gardens as a startled gentleman manages to dodge breathlessly out of the way; we see Miss Potter leaning her momentarily free and sensuous head freely and sensuously out of the carriage window. It's a scene that's been seen so many times before: repressed, respectable young lady lets her hair down, sometimes literally, to give us modern viewers a glimpse of the true freedom and sensuousness of her abnormally modern soul, abnormally stuffed into the social equivalent of a tightly laced corset. Okay, yeah, I get it, proper little Miss Potter with her pursed little smile and perpetual black suit is a free spirit, perhaps even a hedonist, despite outward appearances.<br /><br />The tired, limp nod to feminism just carries on. Beatrix is shown as a child (a beautiful if weirdly precocious girl), primming up her mouth furiously at the suggestion that she will one day run a household, passionately declaring to her clueless mother that she will never marry and will be loved \\"by my art\\". Said clueless mother stolidly proclaims that Beatrix shall marry because \\"all girls marry\\". Really. This woman, who spends the movie putting her daughter down in the stupidest, most obvious and hamfisted ways, is a caricature. I can admire her skills as a chatelaine and a hostess to glittering society (and those really were admirable skills), but I cannot believe in her. She is a cardboard cutout, soblinded by her social climbing and limited ideas of womanhood that she cannot in any sense recognize her daughter's talent and, eventually, fame. Oh, I believe there were/are mothers like her, but this portrayal is a cartoon.<br /><br />It just gets worse when Norman Warne's sister Millie, who would be utterly ridiculous if not played by an actress as superb as Emily Watson, makes her declarations about marriage, declared \\"shocking\\" by Miss Potter, althought they would sound insipid and just plain silly if coming from any mouth but her regal and precise one. Of course, she shows the cream puff heart of this movie by melting into coos about \\"being loved\\" when Beatrix guiltily whispers of her marriage proposal from Mr. Warne.<br /><br />These weakly flailing little slaps of feminism are brought to a climax when a newly independent and frisky Miss Potter gleefully cuts off an overbearing developer who scolds her for her outrageous bidding practices at the end of the film. Sir, she is no longer in the habit of being lectured to. And fortunately she no longer is required to submit to such. [Lots of money now, remember -- for all this freedom and independence and assertiveness would of course be impossible if she were poor. Right, capitalist viewers?] Oh, one wants to vomit.<br /><br />As for Miss Zellweger, I found her performance simply odd. I don't dislike her. She was charming in \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\". I do think she was miscast here and that her performance displayed a split personality: Most of the time she was a very soft-spoken, slightly self-effacing woman, but occasionally this odd, trumpeting, hooting harridan popped through, pinch-lipped and commanding. You see it when she waltzes out of the Warnes' office at the beginning, having regained her portfolio. You see it a minute later when she tells her footman (in a voice and accent notably different from the one she uses in the rest of the movie) that she wants to drive through ALL the parks. You glimpse her when she is first shocked by Norman Warne's suggestion that she accompany him to the printer's, then swiftly acquiesces. I understand that we all speak differently in different situations, but this is not believable.<br /><br />Miss Zellweger is an extremely pretty woman, but the camera is not kind to her in this movie. I understand that Beatrix Potter was plain, but that is not the same as unattractive. The lovely Miss Z. becomes unattractive in this movie purely from bad lighting and bad camera angles.<br /><br />Despite all this scathing criticism, I still give the movie three stars? Why? It works perfectly well as a period romance, for one. And the romance in this one is particularly sweet -- perhaps I should say bittersweet. The love scenes are very touching, the men are very handsome, the glimpses of Hilltop Farm breathtaking. I have also mentioned briefly the use made of Beatrix Potter's illustrations, and that was very well and imaginitively done.<br /><br />Oh, don't listen to me. I'm just a grouchy woman who wishes that the movie had focused less on Potter's bittersweet romances and insufferably snobbish mother and more on her actual work, to which this movie does not begin to do justice. But if you are watching it because you enjoy unobjectionable romance in beatifully filmed period pieces with just a piquant hint of feminism to add spice to the counterfeminism of the love story, then you will enjoy this. No, really. You will.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love subway surfers I'M a expert. I'm on world tour I'm in Rio right now .and it's really fun.it's my favorite game on my kindlefire.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like that it not only shows the percentage you have left but it breaks down each use and how many hours you have for each one.  It breaks down how much time for video or web browsing or music and so on.  I recommend....also you can make it any color and it is visually appealing as well!  GET IT!
B003L77GRO|5.0|As already stated it's more Dexter. If you like Dexter then that's all that needs to be said. If not, why are you looking at the review?
0792163710|4.0|Yes this kid is annoying.  Yes it is outdated.  Yes the &#34;Davy Crockett&#34; bucksin outfit is disconcerting.  But watch the movie again.  If you had to go to Mars with one movie to demonstrate what an American western is all about, how could you find a more classic example than Shane?  Are there better westerns?  Depends on your taste.  Is there a better example of what an American audience wanted and expected from a Western in the Western heyday of the 1950s?  I submit that by the measure of its time, 1953, this is the &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34; of Westerns.  Hey, even Clint Eastwood holds it in such high regard that he lifted scenes virtually intact from Shane for his 1985 &#34;Pale Rider.&#34;
B00A11AN6O|4.0|its different from other drive storages, give more option and can do different things to it. plus its cool too
B008EZVNO0|3.0|I loved Van's music when he was going through his Christian awakening - very spiritual. This is ok; I feel like he is coasting a bit and just doing what he likes without the edge of trying to prove himself - not that he has to at this point. Nothing memorable on this CD. Give it a miss unless you are a real die-hard Van fan.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|It is a beautiful story with great songs. All of the kids enjoyed it from teenager to toddlers. a Classic must watch

B000E5N6LG|4.0|Tombstone beat this movie to the box office, and Kurt Russell's Wyatt Earp gained more attention than Costner's relatively understated performance (let's face it, Kurt Russell did everything but chew on his gun barrell in Tombstone).  This is the more balanced, realistic movie.  Although Costner's Wyatt Earp is still firmly within the &#34;heroic-myth&#34; mold, Costner shows a man with warts and flaws, not just &#34;Dirty Harry from Dodge City.&#34;  If you have not seen it, it is worth watching---if only to compare Doc Hollidays.  Val Kilmer's seductive, southern sadist in Tombstone; or Dennis Quaid's tuburcular, alcoholic misfit in Costner's movie.  Then you can go back and watch Victor Mature's take on Doc Holliday from 1946.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|recommend to all ages, couldnt put these books down read all of them in a few days whilst on holidaysloved it
B005NKGEP2|2.0|OK, if you're interested in the international, money-to-burn scene, you might like this. The author spends too much time naming streets that run into this avenue and going on about moving from this place to that in Europe. Too much description and not enough of a story. Pretty mediocre read in my opinion.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|My wife loves it! The &#34;ports&#34; are secure, yet accessible, much more so than the Otter Box she had before. She hasn't subjected it to water or severe shocks yet, so we'll see long term. Fits beautifully into the LifeProof Armband.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I already loved this movie and had to replace damaged DVDs I had and this is one of my favs.  If you love the movie get it, if not don't, if you have never seen it you will probably like it!
B003SNKBXW|1.0|The books is actually quite good, but the copy I purchased had many errors and since the book relies on close textual analysis, this can be a problem. I notified Amazon, and they may have made changes.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|great story line for the romantics a few good twists and turns to get ot the ending, not sexualy explicit
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved this book! Introspective and thought-provoking, wrapped in a grand story of adventure, survival and finding one's spiritual path among the tangle of religions. Read the book before seeing the movie and enjoyed both. As always, the book was much deeper than the movie. A most wonderful read!!
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|If I wanted a history book I would have bought one.  I was very disappointed in this book.  So much so that I couldn't finish it.  I wish I had been able to get a refund.

0307744434|5.0|One reviewer here commented that \\"no production company could make real the fantastical things Morgenstern makes me picture in my head.\\"<br />The reviewer has never been to Burning Man.<br />I know, the playa is not a movie set but after the first few pages into Erin's exquisite work I thought to myself, \\"She's been there and has managed to relay the experience in print.\\"  I don't know if she has but never in my wildest dreams could I imagine anyone accomplishing that work.  Erin has.  Its all there...the tents, the fire dancers, the \\"bonfire\\", the almost maniacal engineering feats, the leaving knowing the experience has given one an entire new family.<br />A magnificent story that I'll be rereading more than once.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I read a great deal, but only occasionally is there a book that is so outstanding that it is memorable for a very long time. \\"Me Before You\\" was one of those books.<br />From the very beginning I was drawn into the life of this young woman and the very unusual situation in which she found herself. Obviously, the content was very well researched and therefore very informative.<br /><br />The ending was not surprising and probably could not have been different. I was enthralled to the last page and sorry when it was over.  Incredible!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is easy and fun ans is a great game to play when your extremely bored. Which has been very helpful to me in the past
B00819ER0Q|5.0|Great movie - finally something that's not just your typical boy-meets-girl or conflict plot line. Jim Carrey is great in this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Throughout the entire book you will remain hooked. I found myself growing attached to the characters and feeling as though I was apart of the story myself. There was a fantastic ending to a fantastic book.

B009VSW15Y|5.0|I felt compelled to write a review because of all the people leaving negative and low reviews because \\" the access to the features this app grants should have been included on the KFHD to begin with\\", while I wholeheartedly agree, it's not the fault of the developer who developed the app. It's Amazon's fault. The app does what it says it does, and the developer of this app had no say in the development of the tablet itself.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-IT HAS A TIMER! This is the sole reason why I purchased the app, I found myself wanting a timer function on this tablet when taking pictures, and this app delivers.<br />-Simple to use.<br />-Has some neat filter options (Aqua, Sepia, and some others).<br />-Only .99c, which is cheaper than some of the other camera apps on here that don't even feature a timer function.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not so much an issue with the app, but it was something that happened while downloading. It said the downloading file had been corrupted so it stopped downloading, it kinda freaked me out, but it soon let me push the download option without having to purchase again. I just wanted to write about it in case someone else encountered the same thing and freaked out like I did.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Was not sure how this book would be as entertaining as the first - but it was. Loved this and read it even quicker than the first. These books are addicting!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|There was potential for a complex story but its too superficial.  Doesn't dig in deep enough.  And then the ending seems quick and forced like she had a word limit and just needed to end it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book kind of took me back to the old days of Clancy where there were a lot of subplots within the main plot which all kind of tied together as it neared the end.  Even though a lot of the stuff was somewhat predictable, I enjoyed it and was anxious to get back to it everytime I put it down.
0446677450|5.0|I learned a lot from it and have applied a few of the things I have learned with good success!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Like Temple Run original, the game isn't sensitive to your turns or jumps to get something, but is very sensitive to your mistakes. This feature has frustrated me quite a bit, but the great graphics make up for it. It feels like as soon as I get up, I'll be chased by a huge, demon monkey. The new game gives you a new feel, with different obstacles like ziplines to go through, and it's based in a different place than the original one. But my favorite feature has to be the minecart segments. I love riding and tilting and ducking in an all new place. I think Imangi Studios has really outdone itself this time.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love, love, love, love this calculator.  I love that it is easy to use.  I don't have to figure out how to use the scientific functions like on most calculators!  I am not stupid by no means but jfI wanted a scientific calculator I would have searched for one instead of getting this one!!!!  &lt;3 &lt;3. &lt;3. to the creator!!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Although it was overall a pretty predictable story, I was still excited to read it. After I read the book, I knew it would make a great movie. However, after seeing the preview and seeing how many unnecessary changes they made, I don't even know if I will see it! The book is guaranteed to be 100x better than the movie, per usual.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Just finished Season 3 on DVD.  We lost some long-time cast members, for which I'm sad.  But new characters were introduced and I'm sure I'll love them too.  Can't wait to see Series 4!
B008PNBU30|5.0|The entire album is great from start to finish. Three Days Grace usually produces this type of album. It completely exceeded my expectations.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this book!! I recommend the series it's good one though a tear jerker! This author is wonderful can't wait for more!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A quick and super entertaining book - every time I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. Never understood what all the fuss was about until I read it for myself... Haven't seen the movie yet but recommended for both people who have seen it and who haven't.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great way to follow fellow tweeters everywhere.<br /> .Keep abreast of current events & experiences. Love the changes as its needed for better communication.
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|This was purchases as a gift and the box had small marks, indentations on it. I returned it for another one and the vendor shipped me the exact same one. When I contacted him he told me none he had was in any better shape and if I was that picky I should go to a store and pick it out.
B008476HBM|5.0|Of course this was an excellent read and I am excited to begin Sense and Sensibility!!! Glad I was able to get it free on my Kindle!
B008H6GH8I|5.0|This is a Awsome Resident evil movie. Greatly improved from degneration and plus the action and intensity was great also. I've been waiting for this movie to come out since early 2011 and when it finally came out last year 2012 I ran to best buy and brought it with no hesitation. When I came home that day I immediately poped this in my PS3 hoping for the best and I sat in my chair amazed by how intense this movie really was. Degeneration has nothing on this I said while watching the movie. If you haven't seen this movie GO out to best buy or whatever store sells dvd's and get this. It's well worth the money.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|When I first saw this on new releases.. I thought it would be one of those &#34;We'll show only the best parts&#34; I bought this last week and really liked it. Aliens, fighting, survival. Would recommend this one with 2 thumbs up.

1616550414|5.0|I had actually never heard of this book. I came on amazon one day, and it suggested it to me, and since it was for a decent price I ordered it. This book is actually amazing. It clarifies everything you already know, and gives you more facts to back up the arguments, as well as you learn a lot of new things that weren't too blatant, and it poses some questions that leaves it up to your imagination to fill in (like is the ocarina of time made from the same material as the timeshift stones from skyward sword?)
B009MO5G90|1.0|Well their's not much I can say other then this was a very god awful movie. But what I can say is I didn't even bother to buy this movie. I rented it in the PS3 store in 3d and I'm very happy I did. Let me make this short, The only reason why I wanted to see this movie was because I thought the trailer looked actually good. Not only that, I thought it was going to be real interesting seeing past Resident evil cast and them being the ones to terminate alex. I was wrong. This movie was a jumbled mess with a pointless plot and terrible acting, also the action was down right pointless as well. Honestly the best live action Resident evil is Resident evil apocalypse. And another thing the ending in this movie looks like they will be making another one. Just stop already please.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this movie.

0670024813|1.0|While Diamond is an entertaining read, that's all he is. Most of his 'facts,' are simply manipulated numbers and anecdotes. If you're up on your current events and anthropological data and theory you'll find Diamond to be infuriating. I don't need to go through this book point by point, there's plenty of blogs that already have done so. All I need to say is, do proper research on what this author talks about and you'll see that he's got just a bad habit of blowing smoke.

B00AG6Z92C|4.0|As a big fan of Andrea Bocelli and his  music, very dissapointed by including JLO to his album. Not good and elegant enough for him. He belongs to the top of his genre and unfortunately paring with her  even only for one song was a mistake.<br />People love him because he is one of the greatest and have a class  and this is what makes his art so attractive. In this case mingling with average is undeserved.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Another good read about Harry Bosch. Fans will fly through the pages for a story that provides some unique insites into police work and solving closed cases. A little too far fetched for all tastes, but a winner nevertheless.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Amazing cast and storyline true to the book. I especially enjoyed the Rocky Horror scenes, as it is my favorite movie of all time. I instantly fell in love with The Perks of Being a Wallflower and you will too.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great flying scenes.  Good character development. The plot has a couple of slow spots and the ending was unfortunately predictable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I can't really review it, since I don't use it...however my wife uses the crap out of it. I suppose it must be good!
B006IK1U8C|5.0|A well done book and a must have for those who appreciate fine guitars. Visually the photos are stunning and highlight the features that make these guitars unique.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|The repeating times make it very convenient for collage classes. The snooze feature also helps to make sure you don't just fall back asleep.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have put way to many hours into this game. This game has tons of replay value. The graphics and interface are just right for this type of game. Lots of plague unlocks that require different strategies to successfully destroy humanity. Heh... Never thought I would write that phrase. Excellent job Ndemic! Thx for bringing this game to the Amazon app store!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|There is beautiful scenery. There are beautiful people, great character development and interesting story line. It is a glimpse into how the elite lived a century ago and how the people who served them went about their jobs. I'm hooked on the stories of all these characters and can hardly wait for the next episode!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I knew very little about the history of World War I.  This book enabled me to care enough about the characters to stay with the political and historical information.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I don't watch a lot of Christian movies, but a friend watched this one and absolutely raved about it.  I didn't see her as a person that was really into Christian movies either, so I had to see what the fuss was about.  Wow!  I was totally blown away by the message in this movie and it really opened my eyes about how strong, biblical values can really transform your relationships.  While the emphasis was on the importance of fathers, I really feel the message can apply to anyone.  None of the men were bad fathers, but it really showed what can happen when you let God's word transform you into an excellent parent and the difference it will make in your family.  What especially drew me in was that the movie didn't sugarcoat about how hard it is to live your values but what really matters is that you live the example of a good man/parent, not just \\"talk\\" it.  The production values are on par with a made-for-television production, and there are no big-name actors in this film, but it is completely unimportant when you feel the beautiful writing and the even more powerful message.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great alternative to those who do not have the pc version. The only complaints I have are that the maps are too small, and I haven't been able to find any wheat or watermelon. But, overall, I would definitely recommend this.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Just about everything is right when it comes to this application. Runs great on my motorola xoom. Way like how the canvas stays put like paper when I spin the tablet arround. Only the tools re-adjust for landscape and portrait. The only very minor negative is that the 2560x1600 canvas only supports one layer.
B008CRC506|5.0|I love this show and loved being able to watch it again. I highly recommend this show and dvd set to everyone who loves Broadway.
B00127RAJY|5.0|First week -lost inches everywhere, but also dieting. I'm 60 yrs old and didn't really think it would. I am getting better with cardio every day.
B005LAIGIM|4.0|I don't know many people who know about this film.  When my sister-in-law and nieces decided to rent it, I was rather disappointed and my expectations were low.  However, this turned out to be a movie that I really love and cherish.  There are a lot of good, funny lines in it, but as the movie progresses, there is also a deep thoughtfulness to it about personal authenticity and how it can make a real difference in your relationships.  This is not at all a preachy movie, which makes its message that much more enjoyable and accessible.  This movie makes you laugh and think at the same time.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this series of books and it made me feel happy also it makes me laugh I loved this book
0385474547|5.0|This is a great book! I had to read it for class, but I'm glad I did because it was an easy read embedded with thought provoking ideas.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Was hoping for a seamless way to be on facebook off my laptop, doesn't deliver.  It's okay but<br />not stellar
0307361012|1.0|I am halfway through this book and will stop there since I have no time to waste. I'm not certain as to what Nesbo wants us to like or dislike about the characters but he fails to give them any realist traits.<br />I wonder how this would fare if it weren't from the Nordic countries?
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I love fantasy movies in general and this one did not disappoint.  It is great to have a gritty, adult re-telling of the old fairy tale I had read as a child.  At first, I could not imagine Kristen Stewart as Snow White. She never struck me as all that beautiful and there is a moroseness about her.  However, given the dark nature of the film, her general film persona actually worked in her favor in this particular role.  On the other hand, Charlize Theron blew me away with her performance as the evil Queen Ravenna.  There is a love triangle in the film, and I like the fact that it was not neatly resolved at the end.  Yes, it leaves room for a sequel, but I also felt it was a satisfying, appropriate ending to the film.  This is not your grandmother's Snow White; plenty of good action, drama and excellent characterizations.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The John Grisham books I have read have all been really good.  The story line hooks me and keeps me going and I like his plots a lot.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is one of the best books that I've ever read in my whole entire life  I loved it so much
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is one app every device should have. it is without a doubt a life saver. even i can see it without my glasses.
B007REV4YI|4.0|review is on the blu ray disc of Skyfall-<br />movie - 4.5 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br /><br />great movie, super audio and video all around.<br />watched it about 3 times already, apart from going to the movies to see it when it opened in<br />November last.<br />a must have for all Bond fans to update your collection.<br />highly recommended.
0060557818|5.0|This book has been recommended to me for awhile by a few people so I finally took the plunge!<br /><br />Gaiman creates a very wild urban fantasy world known as London below where life is dangerous, mysterious and gross. I loved the way the main character Richard, took awhile to acclimate to his new surroundings.<br /><br />I have heard people compare this book to Alice in Wonderland, but I felt it also had a combination of a Tolkien quest tossed with nasty villains bent on world domination and a dash of Greek mythology. The book will appeal to anyone who enjoys a fantasy world they can truly immerse themselves in.<br /><br />I'm giving this book 5 stars because it's a very fun read!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I'm not crazy about this game .... if you don't earn points you can't play the game ... I don't like this game @ all ....
B002UBRFDC|5.0|As I read the book, I started understanding better the cultural differences between Europeans and Japanese people at the time. The story is captivating. Not much else to add to the other reviews, so I'll leave it at that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is really entertaining and fun to play even the minecart caves even though it should be turned by may-be like a switch on the screen because it does get annoying when you are going to lean you hit the center rock
B007VUA7VO|5.0|the best battery saving app ever so detailed get it asap!!!!!i have it on my kindle fire hd and have never looked back
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Too depressing for me. When I got to the end of the first one, I couldn't bear to think about reading another. I guess I prefer my endings to be less of a bummer.
B007MHVVCU|3.0|I liked Alex rider series a lot better than ravens gate because it is a lot funnier and has more action and is not as suspenseful
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book told you what team work could do in the games.  The second book showed you what a price you can pay for being the winner.  Loved how they to you through their lives.  Thanks Again!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Another excellent and intriguing book. So nice to see him come so far with her. Kind of left you hanging though. I hope they hurry up and write more. I love reading about their family and how far he has come.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Game is fun but says I have power ups when I don't and when I do have them wont let me use them. freezes up a lot and then you lose your bongo cards not right. have told field support. about this. a while ago an nothing has been done as of yet.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Wherever it is, I hope the supply will last a long time. This was a thoughtful tale with an interesting, though different kind, of protagonist. Such a unique system of magic, but very believable and very well written. Bravo!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I instantly feel in love with the characters, couldn't put the book down.  Very much looking forward to reading<br />Walking Disater
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a basic calculator for simple household stuff like bold,etc. This calculator is great for that type of work. I love the fact that it's display uses the entire Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; screen. That way the calculator buttons are nice and big which makes it easier for these big old fingers of mine to use. I also like the fact that it will save your calculations so you can always review your work!
B000FC12SM|5.0|I love this book. My questions have been answered and am looking forward to applying it to my relationship! Thank you John Gray!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Execellent hiking book.  A little agonizing at times.  She took on too much with the state of her mental health.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great story by Balddicci.  He does well at capturing both male/female person as.  Kept me guessing right up to the last.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|I really wanted to like this film - I heard it was a return to Craig's Casino Royale performance and with the addition of Sam Mendes directing, what can go wrong? Unfortunately, this is one of the least original Bond scripts ever written, fully of faulty logic and plot contrivances.<br /><br />It starts off with Bond trying to recover a database of spies' real identities (Mission Impossible), gets into a rooftop motorcycle chase (Tomorrow Never Dies), then gets into a fight on a train rooftop (Octopussy) where he gets shot and plummets into the water (The Bourne Identity). MI6 is blown up (The World is Not Enough), their agents are being killed globally (Live and Let Die) and Bond is presumed dead (You Only Live Twice). Bond reverse-engineers a finger print from the bullet (The Dark Knight), is given a custom gun by Q (License To Kill) and flies to Shanghai to recreate the elevator sequence from Diamonds Are Forever. All this chaos is computer controlled, just as in Eagle Eye.<br /><br />Regardless of all the copied action set pieces, the bad guy's master plan makes no sense at all. It starts out as a Wikileaks-style plot to reveal the identities of all MI6 secret agents and this story is completely forgotten about 45 minutes in. Then it turns into a revenge flick against M where essentially the world's great cyber-terrorist uses near telepathic precision to... get back at his boss. It then goes into Dark Knight territory in an attempt to show Bardem as a fiendish mastermind who uses his capture only to get closer to his end target - but Bardem is no Heath Ledger.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br />The final action piece is really flat for a Bond film, especially one as long as this one. Bond decides to take M to a remote house with no firearms or law enforcement while Bardem's machine-gun-wielding army descends upon them. Two old people and an aging Bond armed with nothing but a rifle and a stiff British upper lip then somehow manage to kill the bad guys in a cringe-worthy sequence where Home Alone meets MacGyver. In the multiple times that Bardem can kill M, he simply doesn't for no reason whatsoever.<br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />The dialog throughout the film is atrocious, especially between Bond and Eve, with their witty banter misfiring horribly. There's a really awkward sex scene moment, where Bond establishes that the villain's girl was rescued from the Macau sex trade and in practically the next scene he shows up naked while she's showering. Take away the license to kill and add Bond to the sex offenders registry.<br /><br />While I can see what the writers were trying to do to update Bond, the endless conversations about new technology and young kids versus the old school wears a little thin. Changing his character from suave, intelligent, incorruptible and indestructible to a broken, aging, shot-up alcoholic isn't good for the franchise either. And where are the gadgets, the girls, and the glamour? It's all a mishmash of every other action film out there minus the things we all like about James Bond.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very weak script lacking any originality. While it might be a good popcorn flick if you just want to waste a few hours, there are plenty of other better Bond films.

0452287022|3.0|It was difficult to become involved with the characters. I get that the style of The Girl with the Pearl Earring is meant to emulate Vermeer's painting style. However, real life is not flat like a painting. Iciness, restraint and a sense of brooding came through strongly. I'm torn between wanting more from this book and just wanting it to be over. Luckily the book is short and it was a quick read.
B005KIR3PC|5.0|My 5 year old boy LOVES Legos! He picked this one out specifically because it is a 3 in 1 - there are directions on how to build 3 different items (here, cars). Even though h is 5, he can still figure out the directions and build. There were a few times he needed a reader to help him. He finds great joy in completing each Lego!
0307730697|5.0|An amazing man.  An amazing American.  A story of humanity from the low of the lows to the high of the highs.  A family success story.  A wife as strong a warroir as her husband.  A book that touched every emotion.  A read you just can't stop.  A story that makes me want to be a better human.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My family enjoys this show. Even my husband can't get enough of it.  We also like that we can watch this via Amazon Prime.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of those books that I wish I had 6 stars to give. I was a little worried when starting it fo a few reasons:<br /><br />1)It's #1 on the NY Times best seller list; I'm sometimes weary of books that are too popular being over-rated. I dislike reading books that everyone else says I *should*.<br />2)Another blogger posed the question as to whether or not this book would have been so well-received had a woman written it? Now, I'm not a reverse sexist when it comes to writers, so I don't really care what your gender is if I like the writting style. But a man pulling off a legit-sounding voice for a teenage female character is tough to do. Green nailed it.<br />3)I was worried I couldn't look past my editing pet-peeves that littere the book, such as Over Capitalization over Arbitrary Things. Oh, and: an overusage of misplaced colons. To name a few.<br />4)I'm not generally a huge fan of reading some maudlin book about a teenager dying of cancer. (Good thing this wasn't that type of book!)<br /><br />All that said, I gave it a chance, and I will forever be grateful I did. Green masters Hazel's voice, and I simply fell in love with her snarkiness and imperfections. The book is beautifully written--tragic in one breath, endearing in the next. And I love, love, love the quirky love story between Augustus (not Gus to me either) and Hazel. Beautifully woven, smart and funny people, and a love that will not soon leave your heart. Green also masters the art of \\"going there\\" with his plot line, without going too far or being too icky with the teenage characters. Very realistic, very raw and emotional.<br /><br />As a parent, I don't have the luxury to sit and blow through a book this quickly, but I could not put this down and read it in about a day and a half. Like Hazel's \\"An Imperial Affliction\\", this was a book I actually underlined, starred favorite passages, went back and reread particularly beautifully written lines that deserved extra attention, and will go back and reread (maybe a dozen times).<br /><br />Some books just touch you more than others. This book surprised me, had me laughing, had me tearing up, had me thinking about life, death, the universe, and our place in it, and actually saying, \\"no, no, no\\" to a plot twist I was least suspecting -- and it's not what you'd think with a girl dying of cancer.<br /><br />Superbly written, Mr. Green. This is a genius I someday hope to leave with readers as well.and reread (maybe a dozen times).<br /><br />Some books just touch you more than others.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewel Star is the star. I played this game on my old cell phone and I was very dissappointed when I purchased the Iphone and could not the ap. Now I have the Kindle Fire and I was excited just to start over and play my favorite game.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|As always, this is a terrific show.  My only reason for giving it less than 5 stars was the price per episode.  I feel $1.99 is a bit much for on 53 minute episode.  Several copies on blu-ray from Netflix did not play on my blu-ray player so had to stream.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. I barely can stop playing it. I especially like Rio.<br />You should really play this. You won't be sorry. Maybe
1451695195|4.0|I was very excited to read this book after seeing Dr. Alexander on a talk show detailing his experience. Even though he is very articulate and passionate, the few minutes he had on the talk show are just not enough to really allow him to fully relay his experience in laymans' terms and do it justice. This book was a very easy and interesting read. When you're done, you realize the gravity of his his situation with E. Coli meningitis (less than 1 in 10 million adults in US get, especially withthin Dr. Alexander's perimiters). I was amazed by the exprience he had and the journey he began as a result. It takes an intense amount of bravery for such an accredited doctor to take such a public stance on near death experiences (NDEs) and vividly share the details of his. If you're just not one to believe in life after death, or God, or are closed off to spiritual possibilities or a discussion about human consciousness, this book is NOT for you. But if you are, it's written in a beautifully woven, simplistic story for the average person to understand and \\"try\\" to comprehend the gravity of what he believes he experienced. I'm truly a fan after reading this book. I just wanted a little more at the ending, which is why I rated it 4 stars. I wanted a little more of the \\"what my life looks like now\\" follow up. Maybe an epilogue. I suppose he didn't want to sound like he was only doing this to push his foundation though, and I can respect that.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|runs very fluent on my kindle fire. so it is not strange that this game is so welcomed by many people.
B009AY04A8|3.0|The Crystal Portal G5 hidden ojject game has set the standard for this category of game for me along with other of their titles I have purchased.  Having said that... this game feels too much like a chore due to the overly detailed dialogue which makes you want to skip ahead. The rendering could be better as well, but even at the price I paid (0.99),  I am not looking forward to part two of this pirate adventure.

It is a nice departure, although I do miss the high energy and intensity of classic Simply Red music.  Still, it's nice to have new music from Mick!!!!
B000003S09|2.0|I absolutely love this album, and if you can get it from a reputable dealer NEW, get it.  But be wary of who you get this from.  My copy was very scratched up and would skip briefly every 12-15 seconds on several tracks.  Awesome album, not awesome cd.

B008FPOIT6|2.0|I really enjoyed this book:  It was a witty, enjoyable, and well-written story.  I probably would have rated it as four or five stars based on the content, and had started to recommend it to others.<br /><br />But, I was very disappointed after the fact... I wanted to share it with a friend, and at that point realized that it could not be lended via Kindle.  This is a policy set by the publisher.  The eBook was too expensive to not be lendable.<br /><br />Sigh... I will just call this a learning experience.  From now on, I won't make the assumption that I am \\"owning\\" anything when I make a Kindle purchase, and factor that into my expected price.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|For less than $20.00 (taxes included), this really is an excellent Godfather Movies collection. The restoration is done very well giving the movies the pure feel of the original prints including the grit of the actual film production. There was some damage/deterioration to the originals which was painstakingly corrected along with much better sound quality. All of this is explained in the bonus DVD which is just another perk to owning this set, as well as a little cast/movie booklet.<br /><br />If you have never seen any or all of these movies, this is a must-see movie collection. I had never seen parts II or III and was very pleased to finally understand the Godfather saga.<br /><br />The movie stories are well acted and intriguing depicting the life of Mafia types including the killings as well as the commitment to \\"family\\" showing honor along with treachery. Truly, very exciting cinematography...Movies to be seen again and again.

B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is the most facinating book I have ever read.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks is basically an unknown black woman, yet her cells are immortal and have been responsible for advances in medicine the world over. Those in the field of medicine recognize her as HeLa and it is estimated that trillions of her cells have been used to research diseases, longevity, the development of drugs and on and on. Henrietta's cells resulted in the greatest advancements in medical history from one source.<br /><br />Henrietta died in 1951 from cervical cancer but before her death, her surgeon took samples of her tumor. Prior to Henrietta, scientists had been unsuccessful in cultivating and keeping human cells alive. Henrietta's cells reproduced every twenty-four hours and continue to do so. Her cells are immortal.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells the remarkable story of the woman and her family, not just the incredible contribution her cells have made in the advancement of medicine. If Henrietta or her family had been compensated just one penny for every cell, they would likely be the wealthiest family in history. Unfortunately, they were not compensated even one penny. Unethical by today's standards? You be the judge.<br /><br />My opinion: In the least, a monument should be erected in her memory.<br /><br />Leise

B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50 shades of grey. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Read it in about a day. Ready for the next one.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|I purchased this album after playing Borderlands 2 and hearing the songs &#34;Short Change Hero&#34; and &#34;How You Like Me Now?&#34; Since then I have given the album multiple repeated listenings and while those songs are still the stand out tracks, the rest of the album is really good. I strongly urge anyone to check it out!
B004478GNI|5.0|Grandson loves it.  He is 6 and had no problem putting it togeather.  All parts fit and instructions were easy to follow.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was recommended by a friend.  A fast read.  Wish more of the series would be put into another edition.  Makes you think about what's gping on.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best app I thought it wasn't going to be as good as people say, but when I played for the first time I loved it!
B0054IOWTS|1.0|I had been wanting to watch this for a few years. James Cameron had something to do with it, why not? Other than learning about scuba diving in caves, it really wasn't all that interesting. I actually regret seeing this movie as a lot of the scenes were cringe-worthy. The one thing I did appreciate was that if someone is claustrophobic, diving underwater in caves is terrifying. One of the scenes does a great job with letting the audience know how and why this is a tangible fear. I just failed to see any redeeming quality to take away from this. There was not enough of character-building to make this worth watching at all. One scene, I can't get out of my head and deeply regret have seen. I admire and respect the magnitude of difficulty it must have been to shoot this film. I know that it must have been quite an undertaking.
B005USZYDU|4.0|I really liked this book.  I just felt like the ending came too suddenly.  I would have preferred to have a little more denoument and warning that the ending was coming.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it every day for school, hasn't failed me yet in the year I have had it. great alarm
B002RI9M2U|4.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is an amazing insight into the reasonings for suicide. I am not saying it should happen ever! Or that anyway should consider it. But when life gets rough, we do consider these things. This book is an amazing story that shows the wrongs made towards this girl. It really makes you think about the saying 'Treat people how you want to be treated.'
0385334206|4.0|In the last 2 months I've read Slaughter House-5, Cat's Cradle, and Breakfast of Champions with the UChicago Indy Alumni Book Club. It has been great fun reading Vonnegut with people who have Vonnegut-felt connections through our home city and Alma Mater. I found Breakfast of Champions the most disturbing on the 3 books. \\"Breakfast\\" can be read as racist, suicidal, penis-size obsessed, and crazy. But, it was still wacky existential fun. For those who care about narrative story, I think \\"Breakfast\\" has the most interesting narrative.<br /><br />Vonnegut had a love/hate relationship with his hometown Indianapolis. He loved to lampoon and praise Hoosiers and Indianapolis in his books. In \\"Breakfast\\" Vonnegut sneaks in references to his family's prominent history within Indy. He also reveals some disturbing information about Vonnegut familial relationships and his attitude toward his parents.<br /><br />The violence and racism in \\"Breakfast\\" is graphic and extreme. The humor is not so wry as frighteningly crazy. Where has Vonnegut's sweetness (e.g., Billy Pilgrim and Bokonism) gone? Vonnegut is downright cruel to his characters in \\"Breakfast\\"; even to his beloved alter ego Kilgore Trout.<br /><br />However, in an interview he gave late in life Vonnegut said he'd rather laugh than cry, \\"because crying was so much more messy.\\" Perhaps he got some of the crying out of his system writing \\"Breakfast\\". [[ASIN:[...]]]
B009UX2YAC|4.0|To unlock the other characters takes entirely too long. There aren't many opportunities to get a radio, spaceship or whatever the other item is. Other than that, I really enjoy this game.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I love Rayman - so much fun, and this app is no exception.  Highly recommended, you'll get hours of entertainment!
0345525558|3.0|This book started out beautifully - I really loved it.  Unfortunately, it ended up just like any other tired romance.  I could see it going downhill, but there was nothing I could do.  I was really disappointed.  I say read about 2/3 of it and then quit.  Hahaha.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I usually like all of Grisham's books but I have not had time to read it yet.  Planning to get to it soon.

B00000IZOR|4.0|Just got this play phone for my FMD preschool kids. I can't wait to help teach them how to use a phone and help them learn hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. Really cute toy...similar to the one i had as a kid in the 90's.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I can't stand having some kind of advertising pop up everytime I play a game.  Very very irritating.  How do I remove it?  It's not free if I have to look at some stupid advertising and figure out how to get rid of it every single time I try to play Solitaire.
0307387178|5.0|I purchased this book for my son's 8th grade reading class. I was considering giving it to someone else, but I thought, I should keep this in my personal library. It's a great story for that age group and up to read. This young's man story, while tragic in the end, does have great moments throughout, very thought provoking. Yes, the movie is great as well, but as anyone knows, books give the full story :o)
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|This film was a huge disappointment to this viewer. It caused a type of mental \\"claustrophobia\\" wherein this segment of the pilot's life was like looking through a keyhole, instead of through a window; it was not a broad enough storyline to place in some sort of context. Whether or not that was the intent of identifying the process of addiction or not, it made for a grim movie start to finish. The acting was okay, but story so narrow that there wasn't much room for a more multi-layered character piece. Goodman's overt over-the-topness was just plain getting-on-your-nerves'ness. Denzel's twitches and stumbles were not believable. All-in-all, I was not convinced or engaged; just couldn't wait for it to be over. Both the story and the screenwriting still needed a lot of work.
B000MR1V22|3.0|I had heard raves of this movie for years and was finally talked into watching it while friends were over. It took a good half an hour to get the story rolling. The beginning is droll and a bit depressing. The characters are quirky and unique, but entirely dsyfunctional. The movie picks up the pace when the family jumps (literally) into their old, beat-up VW van. It had funny moments, but wasn't the stitch-in-the-side comedy I was looking forward to.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a kindle purchase. I received it with no problems. I would purchase through this vendor again. Easy transaction. Thanks.
B00008IHN1|5.0|This movie was one of my favorites. It brought back memories of attending a HBCU in the Atlanta no less :o). Me and my oldest enjoy it!
B0034G4OYK|5.0|OMG!!...This movie is definately a must have.  Great family movie...lots of laughs.  One like this hasn't come around in a while.  Add this to your collection...you won't be disappointed!
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|A stimulating look at how to help kids to develop their own abilities. It's encouraging to think that success is very much a case of nurturing character. Fear of poverty and fear of 'not measuring up' are taken on squarely by Paul Tough. While gritty strivers from blue collar families don't have the choice, middle class parents have much to learn about letting their kids get in with the struggle of life. Failure is a therapy if it is overcome. Children want to learn and grow. This is inspiring reading for a father of two, 4 years and 8 years old. What I still can't decide after reading the book is whether it is better to encourage a kid into mastering one endeavor like chess, or whether one should be happier to nurture an all-rounder. I guess the answer to that may be in understanding each child; where does their genius direct them?
0446580848|1.0|This book took way too long to get to too little action.  I've liked DeMille's books for a long time (back to Charm School), but not this one.<br /><br />The only plus that this book might get is if you want his opinions of Yemen.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I wear this watch pretty much everyday (I have had it a little over a year).  It's light, understated, durable and the strap is comfortable.  The value for the money can't be beat, especially with an exhibition case back.  It doesn't have any fancy bells & whistles, nor is it stylish, it's just a solid everyday Automatic watch
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before. One of the best series ever on T.V., enjoyable to watch an  you get so involved in their lives
B007R11DKQ|4.0|Movie had all aspects, adventure, comedy, and drama. If you like movies like with fantasy, you will like this plot.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|I totally love this film -- so much so that I have ordered the DVD in spite of the extra cost due to it being a foreign film.  Since it is no longer in &#34;theaters near us&#34;  I can't wait to show the DVD to family members and friends.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a series of books that developed my interest slowly, but surely and by the end I was wishing for more to this series - I loved that there were some unanswered questions that allowed for each reader's creative mind to think about why certain events happened and what might happen in the future.  I hope there are more books in the future.
B00632HWOG|5.0|...is that it's better than the the actual Yahoo webpage email. Easier to use and just as quick to manage even faster. I don't bother with my email on the computer now I just deal with the mail on my kindle.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, Grisham is able to place you &#34;there&#34; in the story.  The characters are compelling, and the story line is very believable.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|I bought the game for my daughter and it does not work. You touch the item in the bag to move it  it sends you back to the start page everytime.  Then once you down load the game it allows the person playing to unlock games without a passcode and before i noticed by 3yr old had spent $10 bucks on unlocking the games which don't even work.  Please dont spend your money on the game till they fix it and as of this week Feb. 5 2013 it DOESN'T work.
1451613512|5.0|The facts revealed in this book will undoubtedly shock most Americans and many will absolutely refuse to believe it, but it's still the truth. Can we muster the courage to face up to the ugly reality of the empire we have enabled? Can we work together for positive change, or do we have to be humbled by outside powers like Nazi Germany was?
B002S8AGZG|5.0|I became a huge Heath Ledger fan after seeing him portray the Joker in the Dark Knight. He blew Nicholson away. I stumbled across this movie on Netflix and decided to watch it. I think it is hilarious and Julia Stiles does a great job as well. You even get to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt before he started getting big. I know this is a modern day version of a Shakespeare work, but I still love it as it showcases some great talent early in their careers.
B003XME83W|5.0|This chip installed without a hitch and helped my wife's computer speed quite a bit!  Good bargain at a fair price!
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Hatebreed's one band that I've been listening to for quite some time, actually since high school when I first bought Perseverance. I've always likened their simplistic yet intense sound to Slayer, the way they never stray from their overall sound, but throw in certain nuances to keep it interesting on every new album. The Divinity Of Purpose is no exception. After five original albums and four different record labels, the band's sixth album is out on Razor & Tie (Nuclear Blast internationally). Not one to break from tradition, but willing to try new things, they collaborated with Zeuss (Madball, Agnostic Front, Shadows Fall) again with new producer Josh Wilbur (Gojira, Lamb Of God). I'm usually a stickler when it comes to multiple producers/engineers working on the same album because it's never guaranteed to go well, but they trusted this combination, and it worked. Fans of Hatebreed need to pick this one up.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Let me start by saying that I Love Ellen!  I Love her Show, her Zany sense of Humor and really think she's found her niche in doing that.....  and Hosting Awards shows!  Shes Spontaneous, and  Fun to Watch!  I can hear her voice, when reading , and that's the Fun part........  This is the only book of hers that I've read, and I don't think I will read any others.....  She has some good advice for people, which is the way we should be living, Anyway..... But for a Large Part of the book, she goes off and Rambles on about a Lot of Nonsense..... She Lost me there, didn't find it Funny and frankly, couldn't Wait for the book to be Over!  I'm kind of Sorry that I wasted the money on it!
B0025T6EY0|5.0|This show is intense and darkly humorous and incredible sexual so watch out!  Love Duchovny's character in this as well as many of the other peripheral characters.  Watch and enjoy!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well worth the read - I loved all the twists and turns in the plot - when is the movie due???!
B009INAGY0|5.0|Awww, the infamous Spiritual Healing record from Orlando, Florida death metal band Death. Long out of print and highly sought after, this record was the subject of a lot of love and hate from metalheads: love from those that picked it as their favorite Death album, and hate from those that couldn't get it because of it's unavailability. It was inevitably gonna be reissued again and again, this time through Relapse along with the rest of the band's catalogue minus Symbolic (Roadrunner still holds the rights and they've already reissued it). Never having listened to it before yet having heard Human and Individual Thought Patterns (both original and remastered versions), I knew that remastering this one was absolutely necessary. If you don't already have this reissue, get it. Also, get The Sound Of Perseverance, Individual Thought Patterns, Human, and Control Denied's The Fragile Art Of Existence, all remastered. Lepropsy and Scream Bloody Gore remasters still to come.

B000OXHRRC|2.0|This movie wasn't terrible but I won't watch it again. I heard it's like a male spin-off of \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\" & I agree. Was hard to understand some of the script with the strong accents & I felt it kind of dragged on. Not Russell Crowe's greatest for sure.
0910301964|5.0|I did not know about this version and fell in love with the idea of the illustrations.<br /><br />E.B. White devotee and grammar nerd
0143034901|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read more by Zafon.  I've recommended it to countless friends and recommend it to you as well.  The writing paints an incredible picture and in some of the darker scenes, I had to pull myself away to remember where I was.  It's a fascinating and intriguing story and I didn't want to put the book down until I knew what was going to happen.  It's a great read...Highly recommended!
B0091REZMW|5.0|like the game it passes the time. my five year old daughter and I enjoy looking for the things together
B005BGBPBG|4.0|This is a really cute movie! It kinda drags on a little but keeps you entertained. Def worth watching & a great chick flick! \\"Dex\\" & \\"Markus\\" are HOT in this movie!! & who doesn't love Ginnifer Goodwin! She's adorable & plays a great bestie. Didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't like the ending....now you wanna watch it to see what I'm talking about :)))))
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I remember a couple of years ago when I would watch this movie three times a day. The book is always better than the movie. I STILL LOVE LOVE LOVE IT

0393345084|5.0|Paul points out that Since Clinton, we went from a full employment growth economy with no structural deficit and a manageable debt to a runaway structural deficit and a &#34;sky is falling&#34; level of total debt. The interest rate was reduced to 2% and bank reserve requirements were cut in half to stimulate the economy, so that if anything went wrong, there was no room for a non-keynsian monetary policy to step in and turn it around.<br /><br />When reduced financial regulation resulted in the inevitable banky- panky, the financial and real estate, and general employment via the well known multipliers involved went very south.<br /><br />The banks had no reserves (liquidity) so naturally the reserves were restored to the origional higher levels! The bank bailout only offered enough money to cover the raise in reserve requirements, leaving the banks with money on the books, but no excess over required reserves available for lending.<br /><br />Paul proves that when we are in this situation, we have to use non-monetarist tools to get out, but in so doing, he is saying the sky is not falling today or even tomorrow, but does not say how to replace the structural deficits that will be a problem with short term stimulus investment deficits that can be stopped once we get back to a full employment economy.<br /><br />As it is, not only does he ask us to switch horses in mid-stream, he does not explain how we should operate once we exit the water. Describing the rest of the plan would help sell what he says to do for now a lot.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I heard samples before purchasing the album and after listening I liked it. It's rare these days to hear an entire album that's good because nowadays some artist just come out with one hit and the rest of the album is trash. I really enjoyed listening to the entire album but what really stood out to me was \\"GoodBye, GoodBye\\", \\"I'm Not your Hero\\", and \\"Love They Say\\", which I believe these women should make videos of. Overall, you might have to listen to the album several times before you can actually appreciate and enjoy it but I'll recommend it to anyone who wants good music.
B00005JKNF|2.0|I have only watched about 30 minutes of it. I do not like it so far. Not sure I will even watch the rest. I am very disappointed. The reviews I read made it sound really good. I love Downton Abbey also written by Julian Fellows so I was sure I would like it, but so far, NO. It is very slow moving, lots of small talk that doesn't seem to mean much. Some bad language I wasn't expecting and didn't appreciate.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|My 7 year old daughter loves playing the game but gets frustrated over and over again because it seems to get locked up.  The only way to fix it is to turn off the Kindle and start it up again.  The Kindle doesn't do that with any other app.

0307352153|4.0|I received this book free of charge from the publisher for the purpose of an honest review.<br /><br />This book was on the topic of introversion. When I received the book I did not expect it to be as big as it was however I was greatly impressed with how well this topic was researched throughout. I wondered how a book on introversion could be so long, how could it possibly be a good read? How much can you possibly include on this topic?<br /><br />However, this book greatly surprised me. I was very intrigued. It held my interest and I learned a lot from it. I am what you would classify an introvert so I could relate to much of the information. It also helped me have a bit more freedom with the way God created me in this extroverted world.<br /><br />The book explored the whys and how the American culture became a more extroverted place. How it helps and hurts those that are introverted. Then research on why introverted people in society are just as important seeing how they should make up just about half of the population.<br /><br />I found it even more interesting when other cultures were addressed. They typically do not have the same ideal of extroversion and its importance like our culture does. Over all this was a good and interesting read on the topic of introversion.<br /><br />Though there was a little discussion here and there that included Christian thought I would not really consider this a \\"Christian\\" book. Perhaps it is a book written by a Christian author so some of those thoughts flowed but over all it should not be classified as a \\"Christian\\" book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The book was well written and I enjoyed it as much as reading The Help.<br />I have recommended it to several members of family and friends
B0092QITO2|4.0|While not the same as the original this movie is just as good.  Quaid is trapped in a mundane existence but yearns for something more.  He goes to Rekall to get a memory implant of another life and winds up being chased the rest of the movie.  He finds himself amidst a conflict that has been raging for a while and must figure out who he is and what he will decide in order to end the fighting.  Will he choose the resistance or the federation?
B000OONQ9O|5.0|When this came to theaters, everyone was convinced it would cause an uptick in teen violence. When people found out it was a modern reselling of an ancient Greek tale it was ok. Go figure. Cool movie. Gret un.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good book l like how the book continues from the first book. Looking forward to reading the final book.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|This is a really good movie because it puts a new twist on an old fairy tale. Of course you know the ending just not how to get there.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is an excellent writer and his books contain actual research current to today. Sorry that is all I will say.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The movie begins with several seniors, all of whom are facing financial retirement problems for different reasons. A unique opportunity finds them all going to India, to a less than financially stable hotel/retirement center. As the story unfolds, each finds hidden talents, and there's an interesting message that their life experience, in various areas, is exactly what is needed for them and the Hotel.<br />Being a senior myself I thought at first I enjoyed the film because it hinted that we're never too old to be important to others, but then realized that the person who recommended the film to me is barely 50. So I guess it will appeal to all age groups, with each taking away a different message.<br />If you want something to watch that's heart-warming instead of heart-wrenching, make a bowl of popcorn and sit back and enjoy. The cast is - Maggie Smith, Judie Dench  et al are wonderful.<br /><br />And it does have a happy ending!!!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book definetely gives the reader a lot to think about. The book is not well written, but the MD is not an author. In some ways this made it more &#34;his&#34; story than if he had an editor rewriting it.
B002ZG9774|4.0|Although the plot was almost there. The music and dances were entertaining. But I do like Cher. Good chick flick for the plot.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|this was a good book but not my usual choise of reading material . It was more romance than mystery.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I give this game 5 stars, the graphics are outstanding. Overall it's a wonderful app to purchase and I reccommand it
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great series! Reading this with my boyfriend and we will definitely be doing biblestudy with this! Soooo greattt
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The plot was fairly complicated but all put together by the conclusion.  My only question now is how did he get that broken nose?  Guess the answer lies in the preceding TEacher adventure, which I intend on reading soon
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I bought this book after reading several reviews and the premise sounded interesting.  Unfortunately, I gave up on it...which I seldom ever do when reading.  Althought the writing was very detailed and impressive I felt that just about the time I got into the story and could related to the main character, then book jumped to another time period and story line.  It jumped around too much for my tastes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game. I love the game there is nothing bad in it and it is perfect for kids
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is so fun. My kids love it and so do I! It makes them think and reason out how to get the water to move and how to get the little gnomes. The further you get in the game, the harder it gets. Sometimes it takes 3 or 4 trys to see how the lasers work and where the water goes. Worth every penny.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|We love this very engaging show. Terrific cast !<br />The attention to period detail is great and the relationships interesting.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|This is a great album by Annie Lennox and the Eurythmics!  This CD has all their classic greats, and is a lot of fun to listen too.  I am so glad to have it in my listening library.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was awesome and very good and also moving with very vivid verbs and not intended for kids under the age of 13
B00A4OALL0|5.0|The man is eight decades into lived experience! One would think an eighty year old needs a net. Not Wayne Shorter. The material suggest he never expected to fall. Defiant, free, and fearless Shorter and his band mates whirl turbulently through studio and live performances with a grace and nobility that lifts one from subterfuge and mediocrity. Jazz never predicts the next brilliant turn over the life course. Yet, predictability of brilliance is always a safe bet with Wayne Shorter. The best way to summarize the music here is re-imagined virtuosity. Yes we've been gifted with genius before, to the extent to almost believe we've exhausted its treasure. Shorter defies an industry framed by A&R imposed ceiling, and like a net, is a convention the  American music industry institutionalizes. Shorter's Without a Net is a free man's declaration. A master's piece. A combustion of Sun Ra's heart. A phenomenal dissect, and introspection of Miles most experimental works.  Shorter speaks a language not of transport nor transcendence. The vernacular travels a spirit route navigated by the fundamental question posed of what would so and so sound like today. Wayne Shorter is on the other side of this question, a place many of our most creative artist didn't live to present. Here you are. A grand moment of improvisational excellence audienced by a sonic breach in post modern soundscape heavy with replication, complacency, and limitation. Without a Net gets us to the threshold faster, and keeps intact the sobriety of innocence, freedom, and intentionality. Ready yourself for the fall.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I have worn out two copies of this CD already because I play it over and over again at Christmas-time.  I have given it to several friends as gifts, and they all rave about it.  It is just a very nice cd with very lovely siging.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was amazing!!! So many points in the book that got me sitting up straight not being able to wait to know what happens, but keeping my pace because I can't possibly miss a word and keep my sanity at  the same time ;) Loved it!!! Can't wait to read the next book.

B0073PPKNM|3.0|I really, really love Melody's instrumental compositions and her lyrics (where one can discern them), but I can't compliment the production values applied. As some others have commented, Melody's voice all too often blends into the instrumental in such a way that the \\"the absence\\" here becomes her voice. Her lyrics often come across as very muffled. She might as well be singing scat. One keeps wondering, what were those words she just sang? Listening again and again won't give you the answer. Nor will the liner notes which do not contain the lyrics, a glaring omission for an album of all original music. If the liner notes contained the lyrics and if her vocals stood out more from the instrumentals, this album would be a 5 star and her best to date, but as it stands, it's a near miss.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was interested in the way a neurosurgeon/nonbeliever would approach a subject that has no scientific explanation. While reading the doctor's written experience one thing that I felt was his belief and passion! I felt like he was trying to convince me that this afterlife truly exists and I have to say that I did find comfort in his story and the collection of stories he shared.

B00AF6B22E|2.0|I like Densel W. I own all of his movies. I must say, this movie was bland. The acting by everyone was bland. I guess watching the movie passed the time.  It's not that Denzel was a bad actor, the script was terrible and predictable. It would have been a better movie if instead of the 'Captain' coming to deal with his addictions, he took his private plane up and crashed it into the ground at a high rate of speed.  Wasted my money on this one. Movies are advertised heavily on TV and on the Net that it is difficult to know which movies are hype and which are actually good.

0399160450|5.0|Threat Vector by Tom Clancy and Mark Greaney is another Jack Ryan novel. If you have read the author's previous novels before, than I'm sure you don't need me or others telling you of what to expect from him. You'll definitely have your usual spy games, political jousts, organizations that ends in 3-4 letter acronyms  assassination attempts, guns and a whole lot of violence. However, what makes Threat Vector so interesting as many others have already noted is the \\"realness\\" factor. The authors truly gave us a story that could possibly become reality in the very near future. Not distant, but near. Heck it's probably going on right now as we speak, just that the public isn't aware of it yet. Of course, we've all heard of books becoming reality before but never have I felt more so than with Threat Vector. It truly is scary and that is what makes the story so interesting. Instead of the United States dealing with terrorists from countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq, which I'm sure many of you are sick of reading on, here instead we deal with the elephant in the room: big ol' China.<br /><br />Many people believe that the next world war would be based on cyber-warfare and Threat Vector is all about cyber-warfare  If you haven't noticed already, the Chinese area  very smart bunch and even more so when it comes to technology, especially in the hacking sector. Threat Vector revolves around China wanting to seize control of the South China Sea along with reclaiming back Taiwan as its own. In order to do so, rather than using brute force they instead turn to one of their biggest skill-set advantages over all the other countries in cyber espionage and hacking.<br /><br />I haven't really kept up with recent Clancy novels and so Threat Vector was my introduction to Jack Ryan Junior. I definitely recognize familiar faces such as John Clarke, Dom Caruso and of course, Domingo Chavez. Characters such as Gavin Beiry is definitely someone like me and other computer geeks can relate too. Placing someone such as Gavin together with field operatives can make for some fun reading.<br /><br />What I like most when reading Tom Clancy novels is his ability to tell both sides of the story by focusing not just on the protagonists but on the opposition as well. President Wei Lin and Su seem to be pretty paper bag characters but we at least get to spend some time hearing their sides of the story. Dr. K K Tong was the more scary individual out in China. It was fun to read about him and wondering just what it would feel like to have so much information at your disposal and being able to impact the world around you with just computers alone. With Threat Vector, you'll definitely get your fair share of action both on land and air. It was pretty awesome reading about the dog fight that pursued between the Chinese and Marines. These action pieces do however require a lot of concentration on the reader's part as they could be hard to follow along with.<br /><br />The point of this review is that if you want a well rounded story that has everything included in the package, you'll be wise to pick up Threat Vector. It is a bit long at around 850 pages though. If you want to think about a possible attack scenario on the United States by none other than China, this book shall do the trick. The timing to it is just right as well. Just recently in the news, Eric Schmidt of Google claims that China is the country to be aware of when it comes to hacking and cyber espionage which evidently puts the United States at a severe disadvantage. Coincidentally, the United States is claiming to beef up its cyber command and defenses to a massive degree. It was also claimed that it was the Chinese that have recently hacked into the networks of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.<br /><br />It's events such as these that makes me think just how far away is Threat Vector from becoming a reality? After reading this book, don't be surprised if you suddenly have the urgeto place a piece of duct tape over the camera of your laptop!to place a piece of duct tape over the camera of your laptop!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I have seen Les Miserables several times with different performers. This is by far the best performance of all times. At least in my opinion.
0765325950|1.0|I will not buy this book. I will not even buy the eBook. I have been reading these books for the last 15 years. I re-purchased every book in eBook format and this is the thanks I get. You are welcome Mrs. Jordan, but you will not get another dime from me.

B0038NN3B4|2.0|This book doesn't do it for me. The only reason I bought it was the authors have two other books out claiming the wondrous benefits of a \\"properly prepared\\" or \\"well crafted\\" ketogenic diet and failed to explain what that was, then - lo and behold! - directed the reader to buy this book...<br />This, coupled with the fact that the good Dr. Volek authored a book about a \\"TNT Diet\\" in which he touted the consumption of large amounts of carbs in conjunction with protein at certain times, with NO fat gives me cause for doubting the objectiveness of this book, and the other two as well.<br />Now, I undersatnd the \\"new reserch\\" angle, and the other things folks say to justify what may be just hopping on the most recent financial bandwagon.... I really don't know the motives of the authors, but at this point I have no confidence in them and will buy no further books by them.<br />I would strongly suggest the two books by Dr. Jenny Ruhl (The Truth About Low Carb Diets and What They Don't Tell You About Diabetes) and the ketogenic diet book by Lyle MacDonald for a better representation of low-carb eating.
B008597UP6|4.0|Kafka took `absurdism' to new heights with Das Schloss - leaving the book unfinished (or was it?), abandoning it mid-sentence.  Or perhaps he just ran out of interest?  I certainly was wondering where the book was going - it seemed to be trapped in a cycle of thought that was rapidly disappearing up itself.  The themes were becoming repetitive (or was that the theme?) - everything known is unknown.<br /><br />I read this book after Kobo Abe's `The Woman in the Dunes', which many claim is derivative from The Castle.  Derivative it may be, but I preferred Abe's work - in the prose, tension, engagement with the characters and the exploration of what I understand to be existentialism.<br /><br />That said, The Castle has many amusing moments.  The description of Brunswick is wonderful - \\"a man who had some influence; although he's not a speaker, he shouts a lot, and that's enough for some people.\\"  And the contemplation of change - \\"this change, if it is a change and not an illusion - illusions are more frequent than changes.\\"  Kafka must also be given credit for his prescience - anticipating the totalitarian world that emerged in the following decade - and for providing a template for Newspeak's doublethink in Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four.<br /><br />The book does carry that sense of despair, of grinding away against a machine you think you understand, but apparently don't.  The incomprehensible machine represented by Klamm - \\"while this would disturb anyone else doing any kind of work, none of it can disturb Klamm, that is out of the question.  Nevertheless, we are obliged to pay every attention to Klamm's comfort by removing even things that do not disturb him - and for him there probably are no such things - if it strikes us that they might disturb him.\\"  Not surprising that an already ill Kafka didn't finish the book, this line of thought is exhausting.  Pepi probably provides the best summation - \\"Pepi climbed up [to see Klamm] again and again, ten times she was driven away, ten times she went back.  It was pointless.\\"  And maybe that is the point?driven away, ten times she went back.  It was pointless.\\"  And maybe that is the point?
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|As always, I am happy to see them in action.  I am only on episode 4 so I can't rate the complete season.  But so far so good. Not my absolute favorite, but I guess we will see.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love Mahjong games. I've played a large variety of them. This one isn't too bad. My only complaint is you have to pay for the whole game. You get to play 4 levels though and each level has 14 layouts.

B005G4TJI4|5.0|I received my copy before Christmas and was disappointed to discover that the included Digital Copy sheet expired in 2011!<br /><br />After complaining to Amazon, they added Dark of the Moon to my Amazon Instant Video library, which was a nice peace offering, but did not remedy the situation in my eyes, as I prefer iTunes digital copies that can be accessed via iCloud for streaming or downloading to an iOS device.<br /><br />So, using their support form on the redemption website, I was able to submit a request and receive a new, functional download code.  So kudos to Paramount for standing behind their digital copy offer!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I learned bout Alexander's experience, and his book, from a pair of articles in Newsweek.  I was intrigued by what I read there, so I downloaded the book.<br /><br />The book is a very good read.  Besides my being fascinated by the story he tells, he has done a really good job of putting the narrative together -- alternating between his own vivid memories from his time in the coma and the external narrative he learned later from his family, i.e. what was happening to him physically and the activities of his family and friends.  I was already interested in learning about his experience, but was surprised to find that the book was also a real page-turner.  At the end of each chapter, you want to read what comes next.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I have always loved movies like this and these actors do a great job with it.<br />Adding a girl is a good twist.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun it works great on my kindle. It doesn't lag. It's great for when your bored and have nothing to do.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Very repetitive...the author builds up the plot and the excitement and then nothing really ends up happening?... I found it to be a little bit of a tease.<br />The first one was definitely better and the third one is also good the second one no so much ! I finished it because I needed to know what happened but I did skip a few pages. :(
B000KKPN5C|5.0|If you are in the market for the strongest flash around with the most bells and whistles, or if you live in a huge house with very high ceilings, then this is not for you. If you are interested in an alternative to your on-board flash that will allow you to bounce light off the ceiling, take brighter/better pictures in your house or at night, and present the skin tones of your subjects in a much more flattering light, this is for you. This flash is not huge, which is actually nice for me since I carry it around so much with kids. The battery life is excellent. Extremely happy with this purchase.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|Kids loved this one. They are still watching it all the time.<br />I felt it was more of a Halloweenish kind of movie.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I was not happy after downloading and finding out there was no camera lens on the back side. It is really hard to take a picture with the lens facing away from you.  Not a usable camera.

B008K3HRF0|5.0|I (as well as the kids) LOVE this movie. I like dr seuss books, always have but this movie really gives this story a kick. LOVE the songs in this one as well. The message about saving trees I think is an important one and this movie really helps bring that importance in.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter loves playing this game and it is cool how she can build stuff and even play with her cousins in the same worls when they come over.  They all love this game, was worth the price, she plays it everyday and has not gotten bored of it at all!

B001U7NVV2|5.0|Why pay more when you don't have to. It's all three \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" and they are awesome! You get three movies for the price of one. This is what you are looking for if you are looking for an action packed Ultimate Collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and challenging.  I can't seem to put this game down once I start, even got my sister to download it and she is addicted too!  Great game.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very compelling.  I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is life changing.  Dr. Alexander is the perfect messenger.<br />Of the many books I have read about NDE's this one is the most compelling.
B0025UUEAE|5.0|I rate this book so highly.  The other books I bought just listed a whole lot of algebraic notation sequences - Farnsworth teaches how to look at the board for open positions and explains the different types of moves.  He was the only person I could find who actually did this in a way I understood.  I now can play chess at a reasonable level compared to almost not at all.  He is hugely explanatory with heaps of examples.  Highly recommended.

B000FC1PFW|5.0|Another gem from Agatha!  A posh seaside resort.  An interesting mix of characters.  The beautiful, sexy stage actress, on holiday with her husband.  The pale, quiet, wallflower.....on holiday with her tanned, handsome husband. (Tanned husband<br />and sexy stage actress are having an affair.)  The stepdaughter of the sexy stage actress......who has nothing but hatred and<br />contempt for her beautiful, cold stepmother.  The famous detective, Hercule Poirot.  A very clever murder, carried out in<br />broad daylight.  Agatha's fans will not be disappointed.

B006CDCWDM|5.0|Whether you are a tennis fan or not I would reccomend Rafa (Rafael Nadal) and Open (Andre Agasi). If you love tennis you will gain great insight in the game. MY favorite part of these books are the Mondset needed to win. Rafa and Andre have a total opposite thoughts while playing ... Rafa is only thinking about the ball and Andre is thinking about everything else but the ball. Great Great Motivational reading.

0307730697|5.0|Written in a letter to his children and than presented as a legacy of how he lived, Adam Brown (Navy Seal Team Six) stated '\\"I am not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this Earth because I know no matter what, Nothing can take my spirit from Me.\\"'<br />  Fearless-The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy Seal Team Six Operator Adam Brown by Eric Blehm is Superb!  My insecurities that this read would be above my head were quickly dissolved within the first few pages of the book.  I commend the author for this easy to understand brilliant writing.  This true account was one of those books I just could not put down.  A special thank you for Walterbrook Multnomah for extending me the opportunity to read in exchange for a honest review.<br />  Blehm covers Adam's childhood and the principles his parent's raised him on.  The reader gains insight on the makings of a true warrior years before he is in battle.  This soldier seems made to order having these endearing qualities.  Adam's nature was to stand up for the underdog and he was a gentleman to all women, even asking wallflowers to dance with him.  Though small in stature, he was never intimidated by his own size and always wanted to be the one to slay giants.  His own real anxiety was not to displease his parents. As a young adult, he often would appear odd to his friends for not going along with his peers because his first goal was making his parents proud.  There is so much more that I could write about this fine exemplary man but I wanted to focus on his character.  I highly recommend the book for young people and parents although I know everyone would walk away a better person for learning about him and Seal Team Six.

0425170349|4.0|I love the novel's gripping plot and heart-stopping counterterror strategies. Despite my love for it, I can't help but feel Clancy putting all his contempts toward environmentalist in writing this book.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Of course, you must be a Walking Deadhead to like this, and if you're not yet, all you have to do is watch and you'll be sucked in!  I do not like slasher/blood and gore movies so for me that's not the attraction.  What captured me was the human interaction in extreme survival mode while trying to maintain human decency.  Of course, special effects are quality and the violence is necessary for the theme to be realistic.  Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, and Stephen Yeun are so REAL in their characters, you have to believe them.  All of the main character actors, so far, have been so excellent, you're immediately captured and taken on their trip for 60 minutes on Sunday night!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Loving all the angry birds games! Kids love them and its perfect for my kindle HD Fire! Love Love Love it!

0399160450|4.0|I am not one of the computer geeks, so I find it a little difficult to catch up with the cyberterrorism plot. Also, the plot can be dragging sometimes. Nonetheless, it is a great thriller book, cunningly connecting the character arcs toghether, even minor characters can play a heavy role later on.

0307272702|5.0|If you struggle with weight and want to know why this is a book you must read. Written by a scientific writer, not a salesman (he's not selling you a diet and making millions), the proof of what's happening world wide regarding obesity is here. Even more helpful is that he tells you how to lose weight based on science. I would like to point out that although he states exercise may detrimental to weight loss for those of us with this problem, he does clearly state that exercise has many other benefits but that he believes, based on scientific findings, that weight loss isn't one of them. Read it, try it and make up your own mind.

B005V4FJC4|4.0|There's nothing fabulous about this album in the sense that it's plain and clear. I would call it a standards type album. Very well done from start to finish. Nothing stands out as a new favorite but the interpretations are welcome and I added it to the smattering of other Christmas time albums I own.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|It's no Esee5, but it's close. Comes pretty sharp from the factory. The sheath needs some reworking. a few feet of 2&#34; webbing, some buckles, and a plastic stiffener in the webbing and I'm good to go. Just search bk2 sheath mods to see ways to improve the sheath.<br /><br />The factory handles are a cit slick for my liking. I dimpled them with a dremel, then hit the handles with some 80 grit paper and they are much better now.<br /><br />Blade it build like a tank. I'v used it for all kinds of bushcraft tasks and it just keeps coming back for more. Blade holds a edge pretty well, I'm yet to knick or ding it. Would recommend to anyone as a first camp knife.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the kind of adventure game that I personally like to play.

Also Big Fish does some neat stuff.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Great movie. My daughter is obsessed and wants to watch it constantly. A movie the whole family can enjoy. Cute and Funny!

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|In the middle of last year I read &#34;The Goal&#34; and thought how great it would be if that thinking could be applied to IT.<br /><br />This book has done exactly that (and since it references &#34;The Goal&#34; that enhanced the understanding).<br /><br />I decided I would be ordering the full book after only a couple of chapters because I couldn't put it down and spent any spare minute reading it.<br /><br />There are a couple of missing words in places but nothing that overly detracts from the piece. The author should truly be congratulated, the characters ooze qualities of staff in my own company and I have loads of inspiration for my own organisation
B001675SOY|4.0|COB's 2nd album. The band really starts to figure out what they're doing on Hatebreeder. As a whole, I find Hatebreeder is a bit weak. Not technically, not at all, but just not heavy enough, not enough of Bodom's signature hatred and terror. The album is inconsistent in that sense, but a couple songs break through, like Silent Night Bodom Night (one of their best songs ever), Downfall, Cowards Dead End and Bed of Razors. There is a cover of Aces High on here that doesn't do much for me. I know it's a tribute cover, but it doensn't work. Bruce Dickinson is one of a kind, that's all I'll say. I was expecting an album called Hatebreeder to be searing, but instead, you only get a 1st degree burn. This is due to too much neoclassical styling which downplays the construction of riff-driven leads, and emphasizes long runs of 1/8th notes. Regardless, if you have an hard on for COB, this album is essential to own.
B001P3SA94|5.0|but Beyonce does a really good job.  I love everybody in this movie, but must admit its the music that moves me.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I really enjoyed the very involved story so much.  Difficult to put the book down each day. Don't miss it, an intriguing  experience, you feel as if you are living in Sweden.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|a good friend recommended I read this book.  LOVED IT.  It reminds of the old Stephen King books that would stay with you for days after you read them.  This one has staying power.  Great read.  Not what you'd expect.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|There were more twists and turns.  The story kept me riveted and I could not put the book down.  I recommend the book to all those who like suspense and have a detective mind.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Thanks Dave Grohl!  Good vintage footage and a great story. I streamed this movie and noticed the music was quite a bit louder than the speaking parts. It got kind of annoying towards the end.  A must see for any classic rock fan.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was better then the first. I read it within a day. I couldn't put it down. The storyline is very different from other books I've read but I really like it.
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|Not particularly challenging. Felt too &#34;guided&#34;. Clues recorded in notebook in game is a positive feature.  Would have been cool with more electrical type puzzles like the door with the two buttons - vibration feedback was a nice touch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Interesting,sexy,fun and seriously a hot mess of a relationship all rolled into one. Can't wait for the next book.<br />Awesome
B0031RAOVY|3.0|If you ever wondered about your beloved pets remembering you throughout their lives, this movie has answered that question.  True Love and Loyalty abound in this flick!  Get the tissues ready, People.
B003L77GRY|5.0|I absolutely love Dexter! He is so cute snd sexy and dangerous...then he is so tender with Harrison ....too bad he has a dark passenger..he would be every womans dream!
B0079J28NW|5.0|The Blu-ray quality of sound and video is perfect for this movie. We found the extras to be illuminating as well. If you love the Beatles and the movie, this is a fine purchase.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This is another great book by Rick and I would expect nothing less from him I highly recommend this book
B002ZG999U|5.0|Action-packed and full of all my favorite hunks.  Jet, Jason, Sly, Terry, Bruce and Arnold all in one flick.  What more could I ask for.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My daughter is only five and she thought it was funny and wanted to keep watching it over and over again
B008RTE066|5.0|I'm a bit surprised by how pleased I am with this purchase. The Blu-ray DVD is awesome: stunning sound mix, and the HD video is great too. My wife and I watched everything and loved all of it (though we feel Sir Paul was a bit dishonest about the black carnation in the closer). It's great to get some insight as to how it all came about. And the music never sounded better.  The extras, such as the remix of the video for Fool on The Hill are wonderful.<br />I also bought this box set for the double-vinyl EP, which is also stellar. If you are familiar with the show and like it, then buy it. But I do suggest renting if you've not seen it before: some people hate it. But I think it was part of the culture changing year the Beatles helped form, via Sgt Peppers and this.<br /><br />Apple really did this one right.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Well, I mean, it's about as good as a battery app can be. but at the end of the day it's just another app, nothing too special except you can display your battery percentage in the notification center which is great.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie showed what really happens behind the &#34;happy facades&#34; some people constantly portray.  It was colorful (bright clothes and high hair - Hello, Aquanet!) and EXTREMELY FUNNY.  This movie was well-acted and greatly overdue.
1558908846|4.0|I watched Judge Dredd in the theator many years ago & really enjoyed the mixture of serious sci-fy with comedy. This is a movie I like watching when I'm in a silly mood - it's a good pick me up.
B000WMXZ3U|5.0|This is another nice set of songs from George. The production is different from, say, All Things Must Pass and from Living In The Material World. And his slide guitar technique that he used later in the Wilbury's is fully developed here.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Recent problems with site. Lack of information and expedition of changes for equities held. Passing of fees to members that are inherent to the service offered, beyond the agreed contract trading fees.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of my absolute favorites!  As soon as I finished reading, I read it again.  Colleen Hoover has a real gift!!

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed the psychology of love. Mira understands how men think and combines the gentleness of a smart strong woman with a strong bruised man to bring an understanding of love that is worth working for.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I found myself never wanting to put this book down and wishing that I could be that brave to travel alone and to learn new cultures.
034580404X|5.0|I usually don't like reading but with fifty shades I find myself dropping everything just to read it. I read it on my way to work in the morning during my breaks at work on my way back home and at night before I go to bed I love this book :-)
B008ASGP3U|5.0|The start was slow, allowing the reader to catch up on changes in the life of our old friend Rebus.  The tempo builds gradually into a real page turner with a few twists along the way.  The only let down was the addition of Rankin’s other series protagonist, Malcolm Fox.  Fox is not likeable in this story at all and adds very little to the plot. You get the feeling that Rankin doesn’t really care for Fox and it makes you wonder where he is planning to go with that series
B004CFBMRY|4.0|As someone who is not a runner, or who hasnt been since I was 20 years old and I am 37, it really inspired me to give it another go.  I am still running and in a way I have never before.  I am actually enjoying the running and the feeling it gives me not just tolerating it as a forced exercise to loose weight.  This book briefly touches on the technique of running bare foot but I would reccommend more indepth information/books on this technique before shooting off as there are some important details to the technique that this book misses.  Loved the story and great to try and get yourself up off the couch doing something!
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|Amazon featured this as their free app of the day and so I downloaded it.  I have never had an app like this before and so I have nothing to compare it to, but I found it a little frustrating.  It tells you over and over that it is quite sensitive, and it is.  It might be nice to have some way to adjust the sensitivity of it.  Besides that I'm not the most coordinated person and that may be part of the problem.  I find I spend a lot more time on other games, though I probably won't uninstall this one for a while at least.  Again, I'm just glad I got it for free because for me, it's not worth paying for.
0547482655|5.0|this was a wonderful book! I bought it for a friend for christmas and she was in love! She has it in every version, but had never seen the pop up french version. She was head over heels for it. Beautiful illustrations and pop up! It took no time getting to me, and there were no damages or anythign wrong, would definitely buy from again.
0670026182|5.0|Love the photos, the layout and the recepies. What Katie Ate! is my favourite blog.<br /><br />I am a photographer and this book gives me such inspiration!<br /><br />Finally a book where everything comes together because there is one clear vision behind the whole presentation, the styling, cooking, the light, the props, the graphic design and the love of creating beautiful photography.<br /><br />Such a joy to see a cookbook made from passion and commitment all the way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have nothing negative to say about this game it is the best ever and it is so worth the $7 this is one game I am going to recommend this to everyone I know :)<br />You need to buy this game
0545265355|5.0|This was actually a gift for a grandson and so I have not read the books, though my wife enjoyed the series.  I'm only going to review the quality of the boxed set and say that they came in a very nice heavy duty box that really gives it a great appearance on a shelf or wherever you put it and protects the books themselves which are also nicely bound and jacketed.  It is a very attractive and sturdy book set that will last many many years.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use! free! works great, really like that it keeps the history until you clear it! i use it almost daily!
B000002UTI|5.0|Since this CD arrived, I play it when travelling in my car.  It brings back so many awesome memories of John - which is a great legacy.  Onya John, all these years on.

B007TXN4TK|2.0|Sorry but I just didn't like this.  No instructions and the timing of the falling bars made it impossible to react.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have had this app since I got my Kindle Fire. But I never never knew it updated it went from .5.1 beta to .6.1 alpha
0811826848|5.0|Oh my where do I start ... I am extremely happy with this book and also with the efficient  service and no damages in which it was received.  Thank you for giving such a reliable service.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if you liked the first one then youre going to love this one!! its addicting right from the start :) i enjoyed it and so will you :D
0307740919|2.0|Disjointed and often disconnected plot, with sparsely drawn characters, leaves little room for the reader to become immersed in what should have been a thoroughly engaging story.
B005LAII80|4.0|I loved the movie, but:<br />1. 2 out of 3 BluRay players didnt play this CD<br />2. do i really have to pay $20 and watch unskippable trailers?<br />Disappointing, i guess i will stick to pirating...
B0067R0APK|4.0|App is pretty much right on with. the weather forecast. I would recommend it. It is easy to navigate it as well.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Hard hitting and gritty. Tried not to like it, but couldn't put it down. Now I am impatiently waiting for the next.
B0091LS07E|4.0|She is just such a creative being and she continues to grow spiritually and gives herself to the word musically . Always classy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well 1 this is the best game ever 2 I like it better than a boyfriend I mean that means this is a good game like omg it is a good game.3 I think everybody should have this game like really and when I got it I was surprised that it was free 4I think the creators of this game should make a new theme like maybe they can support disney cruise and do a disney cruise them!hey it is a good idea I like the Rio theme to it is my fab so far
B000FSME1A|4.0|The product is as advertised. I am satisfied with the DVD, good value for the price. I would buy it again.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I saw this case and wanted it right away! First, I have the purple one and the color looks great! Second, it fits so nicely and keeps the kindle well protected. It's a great choice for it and definitely fairly priced.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great script writing, storyline, continuity, believable and great acting.  Wonderful program.  We look forward to it and it has a timeless story that can be enjoyed over all generations.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|So touching and heartwarming. Couldn't put it down! Nicolas Sparks has done it again. CAN'T WAIT to see the movie and compare it to the novel!
B0039N74CW|5.0|Wonderful movie. Even adults can watch and enjoy.  Some strong language if you sensitive to that with your kids. You hear &#34;damn&#34; quite a bit for example.  However we love the movie.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I had a hard time making myself finish the book. I kept thing at had to get more detailed and less about the author.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|A downright good movie! Tommy Lee Jones needs some new boots tho, quite the limp he has! Not a blockbuster but for sure a nice way to spend \\"me\\" time.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Works well, does everything as advertised.  There's not a thing that I dislike.<br />And it was free, could it get any better!
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Its a good game to play and past time way..... I love to play the game before I go to bed and or when I get out school
0897500482|5.0|this notebook is a gem one whole chapter on kick ing a man when he is down!  how to time strikes to hit the guy on his exhale<br />amazing amounts of thought on gaining a winning edge in uncomfortable situations
1401938906|5.0|Through the first five chapters, I'm batting 1000. Every one of Pam's recommended experiments has worked. This is a great engaging read that is changing the way I view the world around me. It's amazing how a different perspective can open up so many possibilities. Pam's style is witty while commanding. This is a must read. She's a modern day Napoleon Hill.
0307887448|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Maybe end was a little predictable but it was too much fun remembering things from the 80s.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This sleeve fits perfect! I can charge my Kindle while its in the sleeve. It's convenient and fits in my purse. I love it!
B000VH4OCW|5.0|it's songs in the key of life, for god's sake. stevie wonder at his finest. why do you need a review?
B00A6I87UQ|3.0|I have been using the hard copy for years. It would be a significant improvement if the kindle version had a zoom option.<br />Without zoom, I have reverted back to the hard copy.
1439152799|5.0|Another masterpiece by Kate Morton and definitely a beautiful read.  Has enough interesting plot twists and surprises to keep the reader going.  Don't read the ending before coming to it through the book!
B0002NIRIC|5.0|I do alot of the string changes and maintenence for my band.  We all use this poduct every time after we play.  When our string eventually go dead and it is time to change them out they still feel like brand new.  The strings continue to sound new much longer and never have the feel of a gritty coroded surface when this product is used regulary.  The bottle seems to last forever even though I use it all of the time.  I just bought a second bottle even though I am only about half way through the first because I dont want to run out.  Rub a little on with the aplicator tip, let it set for a few momments, wipe clean with a lint free rag.  Dont play dirty.  BUY and USE this prodoct.
B000SZZIH2|5.0|just buy it, it's their best album and has many great songs. you really cant go wrong unless you hate the beach boys, and in that case you know what to do.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app allows you to express your love for horses. It also lets you have a horse of your own, when you cant have one in real life almost every little girl wants a pony, for Christmas or ETC. So have your own on this app the free My Horse app/game.
1416550534|4.0|I believe this was Kate Morton's first novel, and having thoroughly enjoyed her last one, &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34;, I decided to get this one.  &#34;The House at Riverton&#34; shows the author's skills in full development and is definitely worth reading.  It is a somber history of a family, the family that owned the  &#34;House&#34;  as told by a former maid,now very old, and in her final days.  Not a cheerful read, but masterfully plotted with enough surprises along the way to keep the reader going.  I gave it only 4 stars, only because it is so dark, not because of any real failing.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Much more convenient than buying the DVDs - less expensive and no storage problems.  I'm an Amazon Digital convert! Will buy here from now on. Quality is excellent.
1616550414|5.0|Very informative, great art, and nice size.<br /><br />Glad I bought this, and its a must own for any Zelda fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I wish you could accomplish things faster in this game. I also had to uninstall it twice. I think it's kind of buggy,  but still fun to play. Makes me wish I still had my horse!
6305077630|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies in the 80's and still to this day.  Makes me laugh every time I watch it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new aspects of the game are fun... it looks good and plays well.  Not quite as responsive as the first, but a still great way to relax.
0425252868|5.0|I bought this book for my husband since we heard about it on FoxNews-Fox&Friends and it is a wonderful find. An amazing story and a must read for everyone. Hope they will print it also in German so I can get it for my dad. If you are interested about a WWII story beside the once you usually hear, get this book. A wonderful story about the human part in a warzone and a wonderful friendship between two &#34;supposed to be&#34; anemies......Wonderful Job!
B002VWNID6|1.0|Only half of the movie was available for viewing! I ordered 2 of the same DVD (one of me and one for my sister) and they BOTH were only half of the movie.  It ends at Scene 17!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I was amazed with this film.  Three talented individuals....just making magic happen before your eyes.  Three unique styles...but it meshes perfectly.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game.  It is teaching me more about Mahjong with it's increasing difficulty levels.<br /><br />Warning - it is addictive!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|it was as hilarious as everyone told me it would be. I found myself laughing through the whole thing. funny!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found this to be a spellbinding story of struggle, character, sacrifice, and humanity. If there were three more books to follow, I would read them.
6305428425|5.0|I love this movie.  It just reminds me how bad high school was and how those same stereotypes transition into adulthood.  Two chicks who just live life like there is no tomorrow.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its great I love it's like temple run but better. Subway surfers has the<br />New world tour amazing I love it
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I have recommended this to family and professionals.  The examples make the education points relevant and easy to implement in daily life.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good read. Kept me guessing.  Love the writing style.  The number of twists and turns the plot takes is impressive.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book very much. It's certainly in my top 10 books - not of this year or of last year but of all time. Dean was great, and amazing, and swoon-worthy, and just perfectly imperfect.<br />But what really got to me was how the story unfolded, so beautifully and carefully. It almost made me cry a few times which is amazing because I'm kind of a hard ass when it comes to stuff like books and movies and music - those things just don't make me cry.<br />There were moments when reading this that I grinned so big my mouth hurt, and within a few pages I'd have to place my hand over my heart because my chest was aching so badly. This book made me feel everything-like an emotional spectrum.<br />I could seriously go on and on about this book, but I probably shouldn't because I will start talking about characters and actions and all the twists and turns, and I really don't want to give anything away.<br />Thank you Colleen for writing this tragically beautiful story.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I liked it becuz you can meet new people I would recommend this to kids about 11 it's so good
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game works well on my Kindle, and is challenging and fun to play.  It plays the same as on the computer.
0425252868|5.0|If you like true stories of heroism and honor, this book is for you. The author has gathered many small bits of historical information and has woven them into an interesting account of the lives of two flyers (American and German) during World War II. An inspirational read, and a page turner.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I was honestly shocked by how much more enjoyable Pandemonium was. Delirium was fantastic, but it didn't pull me away from work and chores and responsibilities - it didn't suck me in so thoroughly and completely, that I gobbled each and every page as quickly as I could. Pandemonium was everything I missed in Delirium - the romance and connection between Lena and Julien was much more palpable, and filled with the passion that often gets lost between the lines in many Dystopian books I've read.<br />I can't wait to get my hands on the book #3!<br />&lt;3
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|Book 1<br />I absolutely loved this book! The author did such an amazing job at providing us with the possibility of identifying with such a collection of amazing, relatable and lovable characters! There are so many things I loved about this book that I do not know where to begin.<br /><br />As you read the book you realize that each chapter is told from a different character's point of view. I thought this was a very creative way to give us a sense of each one without having to make them interact with each other all of the time, and at the same time take us to the different settings the world in this book consisted of.<br /><br />One of the things that made me fall in love with it, was the way the world was described with such detail, which is probably the reason why this book is so humonganormous. Also, each character was written with depth and individuality, resulting in realistic and humane personalities. Because of this, nothing was black or white, not one character was perfect and most of the times you were able to understand the reasoning behind the characters choices and way of being.<br /><br />But I think what won me over was the character of the Imp. For all of you who have not read any of the books in the series or watched the tv adaptation, the Imp, is a dwarf by the name of Tyrion Lannister, who is born into a very wealthy family and this family is basicly the nest for most of the hardcore villains in the story. The reason why I love this character so much and the story for portraying him in such a light is because I feel that for the first time, an author has actually included a character that is a dwarf with the personality of a real person and not portrayed him as some sort of comical relief. Now, don't get me wrong, this character was indeed one of the funniest individuals in the story, but he was also one of the more intelligent ones, and this, in my opinion is something that should have been done ages ago by epic story writers. I know I am taking things a little to heart, but I have always been a little offended when dwarves are always portrayed as clowns or magical beings. They are people, they exist in the world and they should be given the opportunity to be part of our lives wether it be in a movie or in a book, in a normal way. I just love Tyrion Lannister and I loved what Martin did with him in this book.<br /><br />The plot in this book was absolutely unpredictable. I have read so many fantasy novels, that most of the times I can predict what is going to happen next, but with this series, I have not been able to do that. And for this, I thank you George R. R. Martin. For leaving me wanting for more. For being such an amazing writer and proving that, by killing two of my favorite characters Drogo and Ned Stark and still finding a way to make me continue wanting to read the series!<br /><br />For creating Arya, who is so kick ass, I just want to get a sword and stick em' with the pointy end.<br /><br />For creating Danearys Targaryan, and showing us the amazing development of a beautiful princess and damsel in distress into one awesome and fearsome female leadin' dragon ridin' godess. You have awoken the dragon in me.<br /><br />I love you George R. R. Martin, and because of this amazing connection I know that we both share with each other, I know you will grant me this favor which is the only thing I will ever ask of you my love.<br /><br />Please kill Sansa. She is annoying. Thank you!<br /><br />So, even though I wish I could just say I loved everything about this book, which I did, I always try to be objective so I'm just going to name one thing I wish would have been different, but this is no way changes my love for this series because it was 'da bomb! I wish that within the range of characters that the author chose to use for the different narrating perspectives and experiences, the Lannisters would also have been included in order for us to read about everything from their perspective. I dont why, maybe I'm just evil myself, but I LOVE me a villain and I think it would have been very enriching to see things through the eyes of the Queen, her brother Jaime, her son the future king, or heck any of the other Lannister children. But hey this was only the first book in the series I have read and there are still six more to read (four of which have already been published), so maybe we will be given a chance in the future to fall in love with the characters we love to hate.<br /><br />P.S.<br />Because of the unpredictability of this amazing, brilliant work of art, the following prediction is probably wrong but I nevertheless still have to get it out of my sistem. So here it goes: I don't know why you guys, but I have this feeling in the gut of my stomach, that Ned Stark who I loved and I still think is perfect is not capable or was not capable of cheating on his wife. I mean seriously you guys, it's Ned Stark we're talking about. I believe, that Ned Stark was actually fullfilling his sister's dying wish (you know, the sister that was supposed to be married to Robert Baratheon) before she was raped by one of the Targaryans and then died. Well I think this wish consisted of making Ned promise her before she died that he would take care of her son, Jon Snow, who is probably the product of this rape. And because she knew how Robert would most likely react by probably wanting to seek revenge and kill the baby, she made Ned promise her he would protect him, and in keeping this promise, Ned preferred to lose his honor in the eyes of society in order to protect his nephew Jon Snow. This idea came to me, because a couple of times in the story, Ned kept remembering his sister's dying words, \\"Promise me Ned, promise me\\"! So yeah, what do YOU think?<br /><br />Book 2<br />I am completely in love with the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series and this second book did not disappoint me. I was not expecting it to be better than the first one but it it most definitely was, and while I read the \\"Game of Thrones\\" in four days, I went through this one in only three days, all while this one being longer than the last. George R. R. Martin proved once again his talent as an amazing author by creating a sequel that was just as riveting, just as addicting and with as much attention to detail and character depth description as the first, if not more. I could not put this book down until I finished it! Would definitely recommend it!<br /><br />Book 3<br />Before I begin with this review, I would like to warn you that this video, will as usual, contain commentaries on my behalf that may just spoil the reading of this installment. So, if you have not read the third book, \\"A Storm Of Swords\\" in the \\"A Song of Ice And Fire\\" series, I highly suggest you pick up the book first and read it before watching this video.<br /><br />Wow, this book was huge! And I had mentioned this before in one of my previous videos, but what I had not realized was how this would affect the actual reading of it. Oh my goodness, I got into all the positions you can imagine and they always resulted in the cramping of my fingers or in terrible back pain. So in the end, I had to do something I thought I would never do before, I downloaded the eBook version (creepy music: tun tun tun).<br /><br />Reading the eBook version of a book is usually a no no for me simply because I have an obsessive compulsive disorder regarding owning the physical copies of all the books I have read, am reading or will read. In this case however, I am not in any way exaggerating when I say that at least for me, there was no other way to read this book.<br /><br />So far, A Storm of Swords has become my favorite book in this series, and please excuse me if I am not being objective enough but I really have nothing negative to say about this book.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin did not disappoint me as far as the character perspectives were involved. He must have watched one of my previous videos because in this book, he actually included many different character narratives, including Jaime Lannister and Queen Cersei's point of views, and boy did I love listening, or in this case reading, their side of the story.<br /><br />I never thought I'd say this but I am now in love with Jaime Lannister. Sure, his love for twin sister Cersei is disgusting, but the faith and certainty behind it is actually quite charming once you get used to its twistedness. As a matter of fact, I have come to the conclusion that those poor twins are monstrous as a result of their upbringing and nothing more.<br /><br />As for our favorite Dragon Princess, Daenerys Targaryen, of course I still think she is awesome but sometimes she kind of annoys me with her bad judgement, which by now I thought would have disappeared after everything she has friggin' been through. But no, do you think she ever listens to the people she can trust? Of course not, she usually does exactly the opposite. Although on her behalf, I do not think her poor judgement has any correlation to her intelligence but more to do with her being a very proud control freak. I still love her though, so back off! Only I can critisize the blood of the dragon!<br /><br />My favorite parts in this book? Gosh, there were so many I do not even know where to begin, but to list a few:<br /><br />1) When Tyrion finally demands his rights to his father.<br />2) Finding out what really happened when Jaime killed the last Targaryen king.<br />3) Tyrion's marriage to a very unlikely little lady.<br />4) Edmure Tully's Marriage, in which we experience very dark and terrifying moments. I almost peed on my pants. Ok, too much information there.<br /><br />Anyways before I move on to part #5 I want to just say a few things about this event in particular. I loved this scene because it is when I finally understand why I have never been too fond of Robb Stark from the beginning. Not only is he immature and selfish (he breaks off his marriage promise to the Frey girl but then demands the same from his uncle) but also he is also just annoyingly stupid. I mean who in the world has a direwolf and decides to ignore them when they try to warn you about someone? You guessed right, only Robb Stark. Although in his defense, somewhere in the book he does do something in benefit of Jon Snow that makes me forget all the frustrations he put me through.<br />5) The choosing of Jon Snow (and I will not specify for what). This scene was like music to my ears.<br />6) The truth about the death of Jon Arryn. And yes my friends, there is another truth and damn it is explosive. I literally screamed when I read about this.<br />7) The deaths of two sisters and a little girl and the revival of two of them. Confused? Read and unconfuse yourself then.<br /><br />And of course, I must end this review with a prediction about the gorgeous muffin, Jon Snow. I still think, like I mentioned before in a previous video, that he is not Ned Stark's son, but now, in addition to this, I also believe that the whole deal with the Lord of the Light and stuff has something to do with Jon Snow and that he may be the chosen one and not Stannis Baratheon. Although, I'm just saying!ead the \\"Game of Thrones\\" in four days, I went through this one in only three days, all while this one being longer than the last. George R. R. Martin proved once again his talent as an amazing author by creating a sequel that was just as riveting, just as addicting and with as much attention to detail and character depth description as the first, if not more. I could not put this book down until I finished it! Would definitely recommend it!<br /><br />Book 3<br />Before I begin with this review, I would like to warn you that this video, will as usual, contain commentaries on my behalf that may just spoil the reading of this installment. So, if you have not read the third book, \\"A Storm Of Swords\\" in the \\"A Song of Ice And Fire\\" series, I highly suggest you pick up the book first and read it before watching this video.<br /><br />Wow, this book was huge! And I had mentioned this before in one of my previous videos, but what I had not realized was how this would affect the actual reading of it. Oh my goodness, I got into all the positions you can imagine and they always resulted in the cramping of my fingers or in terrible back pain.

B00003CXRP|5.0|What an outstanding performance by Tom Hanks where he actually lost a great number of pounds to make his character seem so real.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is okay. I find it predictable, and it has no educational value. It teaches little kids about vandalism and resisting authority. But, if you have nothing better to do than play video games, go ahead.no offense. Warning: don't give to young kids
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Quality is always great from Amazon. And, Downton Abbey fans will love watching season 2, especially if you're a new fan like I am.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I'm a huge Bond fan and I enjoyed Skyfall when it came out in the theaters, but while I felt the film as a whole was good, I think it didn't do service to the character or his fans.  Bond has been many things over the years, but he's never been depicted as incompetent before.  Think about it - a spy with serious mommy issues kidnaps his boss, the head of the secret service, and gets her killed.  In what universe would this spy be able to continue on at his job instead of spending the rest of his life in some secret blacksite being water-boarded?  Anyway, I did enjoy the film, I just hope they go back to what made Bond work before.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|I was really impressed by the visual and sound quality of the remastered film.  It was hard to believe that the original film was made nearly forty years ago.  It's a wonderful story and visually luscious.  Having Nelson Riddle's score in the re-make was the cherry on top.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|If you've seen the other Christopher Nolan/Christian Bale Batman films, you will want to give this film a shot. While not being quite as good as the first two films, it is still a fantastic end to the trilogy.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|If you love musicals you might like this one. Obviously it was a showcase for Julianne Hough and the money to produce the film probably came from Ryan Seacrest. Tom Cruise's character was too dark and weird for me to truly enjoy. The movie would have been better if his character had been less intensely played. The writer was all over the place on this one wanting to include a little of everything for everybody. Overall if you can't sleep and want to watch something corny but fun that will take up a good hour and a half then this one is for you.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is without a doubt the best Christmas film out there!  I was so happy to find this version and will watch it every year!
1423140605|5.0|An amazing book form start to finish. Loved segue of combining the two groups and all of the story lines. Can't wait for the next one!
B004LWZW7E|4.0|This was a great futuristic movie, action packed and full of twists and turns. I would highly recommend this one.
B002ZJGN96|2.0|There was one song that I truly enjoyed overall but the rest of it was just noise. Very disappointed that I wasted money on this one.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|This is a great little app for me to keep up with my email.  I use Outlook on my desktop computer, and was expecting an important email while I was at work.  I installed this on my smartphone (Samsung S2), and the email reached me at work.  I left the app on my phone and because I use Outlook Connection, any updates (read, move to folder, delete) I do on one devise - computer or phone - shows up on the other.  I love it!
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent book for singles and marries couples alike. It makes you think of what is special  about your own personal relationships
B002RSDW80|5.0|One of my favorite movies! As a result of watching this movie several times, I also purchased the book &#34;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&#34; and have made several of the recipes.
B004V2AWKG|3.0|Great book for children. It is really nice story for kids between the age of 10 and 15 to enjoy it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun to play for hours. great game for kids too. never took care of a horse but this game is definitely fun.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It makes you think of a world without peace or law. Sometimes it makes you feel like you are living in this world
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best romance books I have read in a long while. The author really good at developing he characters. Love Holder. Way better than safe haven that everyone hyping about
B0058W74UY|1.0|Doesn't work with Kindle Fire.  So frustrating I can't this to work on my Kindle Fire and it is not very user friendly for troubleshooting
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife's coworker got her into this show just a couple weeks ago and she along with my two girls watched every episode with Prime. I've seen probably 80% of the shows and I was expecting a slow moving \\"soap opera\\". I was surprised that it is well written with many plots and sub plots that keep the story moving along. It also has plenty of antagonists and plot twists. Overall, I'd say it's no action flick and not for everyone but for me it boils down to a good story that it well acted. Finally, it is very well produced with elegant cinematography.
B004D2GMR6|5.0|We really enjoyed watching this Bon Jovi concert and am looking forward to watching it again.  Would definitely recommend this purchase!  Great for a party too.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have a lot of these apps & this quickly became my favorite. I downloaded the free version & loved it so much I decided to purchase the full. Worth every penny! It's the best blend of relaxing sounds & music I have found!
1451695187|5.0|I saw the writer onTV, and was impressed that his experience changed  how he looks as life now.  I can relate to our life as Spiritual beings, because I, too, have experienced proof that we are not just earth beings.
B008OOYALE|5.0|completely addictive and fun game to play.  cute little dragons that evole and entertain.  kindle interface seems different than iOS. not same quests available.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is almost better than temple run 2 I love it more people should play this game what it really needs is a app for cheats that'll be great=D
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Complete trash, don't waste time, money or band width. Crap, crap. How they ever got reasonably good actors to play in this is crazy
B008KYOCA2|2.0|I love this app on my phone but the version for kindle fire won't sync with my google Cal ... or even its jorte counterpart on my phone. uninstall. sticking with calengoo until this is fixed... even tho their ui sucks
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is better then the first I highly recommend it download it now you know you want to lol
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the first and second  books but, this one was just...sad<br />SPOILER ALERT prim...dies. I was torn between Peta and Gale so I just wanted her to Mary  Finnick. But as we all know that can't happen. I wish the books weren't so sad I was devastated. It took me 2 weeks to read the Rockingham and I cried all the way through.<br />So my advice to is if your over dramatic... I suggest you lay off these books.<br />AMAZING BOOKS YOU HAVE TO READQ
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Book One kept the interest up through out.  Book Two lagged for the first half, and then picked up my attention significanty.  Too many repetitive details about foreplay.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a wonderful love story that was unpredictable, and left me always wanting to know more. I recommend this to any Nicholas Sparks fans
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I started reading this book three years ago, when it was offered for free on Cassandra Clare's website.  After I read the first five chapters, I ran out and bought the real book!!  It was that good!  I instantly fell in love with Jace.... I still love Jace!!  He is beautiful to me!!<br /><br />This is the first book in the series, and where Clary finds out she's a Shadowhunter.  She's at a club with her best friend Simon, and sees three kids beating up on another person.  What she finds out is the kid they are beating up on is a Demon, and the other three are Shadowhunters, and she shouldn't be able to see any of them.  This is where her world turns upside down.<br /><br />Through the whole book, there is action upon action!!  There is a sweet moment between Jace and Clary on her birthday, that is my favorite scene in the book!!!  It's such an endearing scene, that I do read it over and over again!!!<br /><br />Simon... he's annoying to me.  Constant whining for Clary's attention.  He and Jace do not get along, and there are times Clary is stuck in the middle.  Which annoyed me... as I just wanted her to tell Simon to grow up at times.<br /><br />I have read this book twice now, and in the span of about four days was able to read it both times!!  I was glued to it, because I had to see what would happen next!!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These headphones are very articulate at pretty much every frequency. One thing some people should consider is if they want open back headphones, which allow ambient sounds in and out, so it's not the loudest of headphones available. The pros for these open backs is that you don't have to remove your headphones every time you collaborate with someone. Personally I like the sound of open back headphones better than closed because it sounds a little crisper in my opinion.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i loved it. many books leave you to imagine your own ending. after so much pain for the main characters, you get to see they get a chance at happiness.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|What a fun movie to escape into.  I just love to completely leave reality and get into a non stop action flick.  I recommend this, it is fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play and if you want to learn more about horses it's also very fun but not overly in depth
B008AK8FHM|5.0|He is a neurosurgeon who has a near death experience. What really touched my heart was when he said that God is personal. I had really needed to hear that. I found this book at just the right time when I had started to believe that maybe the skeptics were right and that near death experiences really were just the brain creating them. Now here is this guy who is a NEUROSURGEON and knows how the brain works, but has a near death experience. This really gave me hope that there really is something after this life.
B008EEHRAU|5.0|Brilliant directing, acting, cinematography and more makes this one of my all-time favorite films. It, however, is not the book nor is any movie ever the book.  Measure this one on its own merits.
0446580848|2.0|Having read every one of his other books, I was thoroughly dissapointed. I know he can do better. I am optimomistic that he will deliver again a great book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a wonderful game! Whether you are a child, trying to show your parents how responsible you are or a teenager bored with nothing to do or an adult trying to learn what to do with a horse you're buying, this game is amazing. It is fun, it keeps you occupied, and promotes responsibility. Plus, it is free! Go install this game and try it today! :) I recommend it for all ages! ;)
0345803493|5.0|Just when I thought the first two books were so good this one was too... The price was right and it shipped very fast!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I find myself saying 'quite right' and wishing a dressing gong sounded for dinner...this is TV at its very best.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great for the brain!  Train it, practice, and use your logic.  Even we old folks can do this!  Trust me!
1609611543|4.0|It is hard not to believe all the data the Doctor provides.  Giving up wheat is difficult, but certainly not impossible--just a little willpower and the benefits are so obvious.  I did not see dramatic changes, but woke up one morning after 5-6 days feeling \\"lighter\\" and more clear mentally.  After about 6 weeks I could see my stomach getting smaller with no other efforts than the giving up of wheat and wheat products as described fully in the book.  So, if you have allergies or other health problems (I have m.s. and follow a low-fat diet, but did not begin this for that reason) it is definitely worth a try.  I don't think it is necessary to be as restrictive as the Doctor recommends re other carbs such as beans, but eliminating all the wheat is a must.  Millet is my favorite new grain, but even our run-of-the-mill grocery store stocks alternate pastas, crackers, etc., so it is not so difficult as you might think.<br />I believe this anti-wheat (as it is produced TODAY) movement will become very widespread and given credence by many more health practioners in the coming years....days.<br /><br />In March, after writing this review earlier, I discovered the book, \\"Eat to Live\\", by Joel Fuhrman, M.D., and changed my diet again---no grains, very limited dairy (skim milk in my decaf), and continued vegetarianism.  No more millet or anything remotely like that, but fruit, vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds in unlimited quantities, cooked or raw.  I'm not hungry and feel great.  I still have wine with dinner and one does not \\"have to\\" deprive oneself of any must-have food. Check out \\"Eat to Live\\".......
0345803507|5.0|Just when I thought the first book was so good this one was too... The price was right and it shipped very fast!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Plot, cast and Scenery all fantastic. A new episode of Downton Abbey is always a treat I look forward to!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A wonderful movie that is oft forgotten.<br /><br />Richard Farnsworth is wonderful in this simple yet powerful story of human love,will and determination.<br /><br />If you are in the market for this movie,this copy is an excellent one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great service. Only had to buffer a couple of times during bad weather. Watched from the computer hooked up to the tv. Worked well though I wish we had an HD computer to watch HD. It was a little grainy but we got to watch the episodes we missed and have already been deleted from our cable On Demand. Love the series!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|There are a lot of really fun songs on this album to sing along with - peppy ones like I Knew You Were Trouble, State of Grace, Stay Stay Stay, and sadder ones but equally fun to sing along with like Red, I Almost Do, etc.  I like almost every song on the album.  My biggest criticism is that they are mostly all similar-sounding and sort of generic pop, BUT... it's Taylor, what do you expect?  They're fun.
0765325950|5.0|Great conclusion and reconciiation of all the stories.  Definate suprises in lead character deaths and twists.  I loved these books.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I like how it flowed; no slow parts. Picked up nicely where the first book left off. I didn't like the ending though. It seemed like there could have been a better ending. Overall I liked it though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show!!!!! Started watching with my husband and now I can't get enough. Can't wait for more. It is one of the best shows on!
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia is an essential part of any Nintendo collector's collection. The art is amazing, and the information on the history of the series is surprisingly in depth. The manga at the end is just the icing on the cake! If you love Zelda and/or Nintendo, you should get this book.
B0036T1RMM|5.0|This is the kind of movie that you watch many times and find something you didnt see before.  Great Movie!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is a truly life inspiring movie.  We have watched it more than once with our family.  It is very moving.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|After all the hype I had heard about the movie I was very excited to get the movie and have a girls night it,  we all just felt it was all hype and no substance
B007ZXK08C|4.0|really good mystery, and an interesting way of writing it with sections in the two different voices, the two main characters, kept me guessing for ages, but I thought the ending really let the rest of the book down, can't say more as I don't want to be a spoiler, and to be honest I don't quite know how else it could have ended, but it did seem like a let down
B000E97X66|4.0|This captures the E. Street Band when they were coming into their own. Like a super hero discovering his powers for the first time. They have extended, improvised, boot-stompin', roof-raisin' rockin' jams and you can tell they are having fun. There are lots of songs with a good combination of big hits and deep cuts. My only complaint, and this is just a personal pet peeve, is that two of his best rockers, Thunder Road and For You, are stripped down to just a piano and slowed down to the point that you can't even sing along. That was a disappointment since they played a big role in my buying this cd in the first place. When you have bonified rockers, let'em rock man! He has plenty of good ballads if he felt like going slow but to castrate your best songs doesn't make sense to me. It's still a great album.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I never got the download for this. It was back when this album sold for only one dollar. I shouldnt complain, but a dolar is still a dollar and Amazon did follow up with my purchase.
1423124111|5.0|I loved this book. The posters, the stars of the book, are beautifully reproduced. I was impressed by the additional details as well: the authors have provided a number of behind-the-scenes details (such as how the Harrison Ford likeness was authorized to appear on the poster for the Indiana Jones ride) and information about how the posters were designed and produced that really appealed to me. I'd recommend this book to any fan of the Disney theme parks--but especially those with fond memories of Disneyland.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I watched the first 2 seasons of Downton Abbey amd loved every minute of it. The setting, the costumes, the witty writing.<br />Each and every character holds your interest. Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess has some of the best one-liners ever.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|This is an incredible abomination.  Take the nihilistic ramblings of Lou Reed and back them by a wave of metal madness.  The combination is deliciously decadent both beautiful and terrible in its presentation.  Think licking chocolate off of a razor blade and you have the essence of this album.<br /><br />If all you want is another Metallica album, then don't even think of listening to this.  If you want the most bizarre asymmetrical din that will simultaneously attract and repel, then rush out and get this album.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Kindle purchase, very sexual, heartwarming.  Book 2 and 3 already kindle purchased.  I would recommend for 21 years and up!!!
1449415881|5.0|What can you say about a desk calendar?  They are meant to tell you the day and date.  The difference between this and others is that Dilbert is funny as heck!<br /><br />I am not an engineer and don't play one on TV.  However, on an almost daily basis, the comic strip for the day is somehow related to something going on at my job.  Puts a smile on my face.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Dilbert, this is a great purchase.  I have been getting these calendars for the past 5 yrs and have never once wanted to change it up to something else.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book gives a  look in the reality of domestic violence. Insight into what really goes on in the mind of the abuser,and the fear the victim feels. Gripping story to the very end. It begs the question of what you believe in.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Brilliant qgame loveball the dinner dash games and now lov this cooking dash well done<br />Hope theres more to come. Maybe the cooking mamma ones .thank u play first. Good job
0446554995|1.0|The worst.  New to Agent Pendergrast. This book makes me not want to read any others. Total waste of time.

B0086700CM|4.0|My granddaughter got me playing this game. It was no her i-pad. When I got home I put it on my Kindle Fire.<br />That was 3 days ago an I have run the batterys down playing it.<br />I really enjoy the fact that the game keeps changing. You really can not start the game in the same way every time.<br />I love the veritiy of each game.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I knew some of this stuff from other reading, but this book pulls a lot of information from many sources into one easy to read volume.

B001VNB54A|5.0|Disc set was the perfect price, arrived quickly, was packaged well, and my brother was so happy! Thanks so much
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer was an engrossing novel.  Mr. Grisham's characters are wonderfully crafted.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Bravo!

B0076DCT2G|2.0|I thought it was poorly written and trite.do not want to waste my time writin any more. I am sorry... I am finished
B00AFEXRME|3.0|This movie has an incredible storyline. It depicts a man's journey as an airline pilot that struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. I see a lot of positive reviews but I think the consumer has the right to know the reasons why it is rated \\"R\\" (specificallly, NOT just by the label on the movie). Every other word in this movie is the \\"F\\" word. Not kidding, and it's so much trash talk I struggled to keep my attnetion focused on the story itself. That was disappointing coming from Denzel, and espcially from John Goodman. Why does Hollywood insist that any good movie needs to be tarnish by such garbage mouth? It seems that every movie you watch has harsh language in it, and it's expected when it's listed on the movie, yes, but diarrhea of the mouth is niether appealing nor attractive and can just downright ruin the entire movie experience!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|the percy jackson series and the heroes of olympus series are absolutely the best. I usually read a book in 2-3 days
0142420891|5.0|I loved that this book was from Adam's perspective.  I thought If I Stay was very well written and an interesting story line, but I thought this one was even better.  I loved that it all took place in one night and for once wasn't a YA about hooking up.  Emotional, great book.  Good work.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|.Pendergast is one of the most fascinating character in fiction ....really good........could not put it down  this review is enough
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker does not disappoint! Enjoyed this book very much. Looking forward to the next book to come available.<br />.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Please get this game it is the bomb get it u will love if trust me get this game.................at first I thought it was boring but now great
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|After trying several other cables to get my old Bose ipod speaker to work with my newer devices, I found the CableJive dockBoss.<br /><br />It works great. If you have an older Bose or other ipod device this handy cable will let you connect your iPad or other devices so you can play through the device.<br /><br />My first generation Bose was made for the early ipods and requires mating the device to the speaker, which will only hold the older 30 pin ipods. This cable lets you connect any thing that has a headphone jack on it to the Bose, so it breathes new life into a speaker that still sounds great.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love this app! I always know when to charge my kindle!I highly recommend this app.  It is well worth getting at amazon.R.Sue
B001OSIV62|4.0|As a New Yorker, I was always curious as to how they got the wire from one tower to the other.  Now I know. Full of passion and daring.  Interesting.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|this app makes it easeir to get the price and the options that i requier it is really ok you should try it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I hate to finish one of Mr. Flynn's books, because I know it will be some time before another is due to be published.<br />This one had a few more twist & turns than usual, but it is really worth reading several times.
B000YABS8E|5.0|A friend told me that this was her favorite movie , so I had to get it!  The plot is funny and Brendan is hysterical!
B0002TJGQS|2.0|The batteries arrived in a plain letter envelope.  I was pleased to see the batteries arrived safely, but I was also really concern to see my batteries were shipped without a padded envelope!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|it was a cute idea, but the novelty soon wore off and the premise became annoying. These are the required words...
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Third reading.  Learn more each reading.  Went to Kindle to save the cost replacing paperbacks. The history is so accurate.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. We watched it together after all the company left.  It is good, but is very long and as the title indicates, is pretty dark.  Heath Ledger is amazing as the Joker.
B00332CWLW|5.0|An amazing story of so many lives entertwined on such a historical day.I have recommended this for many book clubs.Fantastic.
0307591549|5.0|Informative, humorous, and practical, this book offers great suggestions of simple things we can do each day to improve our outlook on life, our experience of life.  Learning how our actions affect our brain chemistry is fascinating.  Don't wait, don't waffle, read it now!  (I don't get a kickback for saying this!)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app! This app is very awesome and creative. If you love horses, this is awesome for you. Even if you don't like horses this app is awesome!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the select apps that I have attained and that has continued to remain on my kindle fire.  It really has no downside that I have found.  Informative and provides useful and interesting information about the battery life of you kindle fire.  Highly recommend.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The autobiography of Chris Kyle is a great read.  The man spoke freely and honestly about his encounters overseas.  He captures a battlefield mind frame and paints a picture of war where there are a wide range of emotions, and experiences, that you would never imagine that would really happen.  Sadly I was nearly finished with this book when I heard of Chris's passing.  It made it difficult to finish knowing we lost a warrior,  someone who kept up the support even after leaving the military.  Thank you Chris for sharing your story, and the thoughts and actions of your wife.  Her side of the story is very important and gives a great perspective to the lives of military wives.
6304712936|5.0|Love this movie! As a music educator I enjoy showing this each year to my high school music class. Although it the Hollywood adaptation takes some freedoms with the actual facts, it's a good way for kids to get introduced to Mozart.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I had to give this book 5 stars, if I could do more I would!  This book is a wonderful, sad, romantic love story that will make you cry, laugh, want to write poems, and gasp!!  From the first chapter to the last you will be capivated and I recommed getting the 2nd book, Point of Retreat ready so you don't have to wait to start it!!
0679735909|5.0|I enjoyed the unusual structure of the novel which allowed me to be in two places as once.  I view this as a masterpiece.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting; beautiful costuming and sets. Captivating epic story. (I had never watched this show - was home sick on a Sunday a few weeks ago and came across a &#34;marathon&#34; broadcast of Season 2 on PBS - watched it all day and am now &#34;hooked&#34;!)
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I noticed this app in the Amazon app store and got it.  I thought I'd check it out & it would be boring, quick.  I had to refresh my memory of how the game was played, and I have been playing it quite a bit.  It's a very simple game, no fancy graphics or gimics, but I'm wasting plenty of time with it the same way I used to play FreeCell for years on the PC.  It's like playing old Atari games like Pacman & Centipede with kids--even Pong--you'd think they wouldn't be interested because the games are so old and simple, but they still entertain, and this is the same thing.  I'm glad that I came across it because I wasn't looking for it.  If you are looking for a fancy, graphic action packed game, this isn't it.  It take enough thought to make it interesting but not so much that it is not fun to play.  Sometimes a classic still works.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game that I would recommend to all of my friends. This is a very fun game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is absolutely wonderful.  The tragedy is heart wrenching, and the comedy is sublime :) I highly recommend watching!
B009J2VQSK|3.0|What was perfect in the film is just good listening ....  there are better soundtracks... i won't play it much...
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|In and of itself it is a nice RC simulator.  My only dislike is a big one.  There are only six, very short levels.  I played it once and uninstalled it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you were one of those people who loved Mario Brothers...No doubt you will love Lep's World! It is a great game! I have the first one and the second one. I like any old school game, and this app hits home! Recommend!!! Download now &amp; enjoy!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good read, quick read. I liked the characters. It took a twist near the end which tugs at your heart.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|Im so speechless with this album. Celine definitely delivered and the wait is definitely worth it. I would recommend this to any Celine fan
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I have been playing this game for 3 days and it hasnt run out of time. dont listen to the other reviews. (p.s. i am on kf so it may not work on other devices)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Highly recommended for horse lovers. Great game, and it`s free! I love the fact that you don't have to have Internet.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I wasn't sure how I would feel about all they hype surrounding The Hunger Games movie...until I saw it and became a huge fan! The storyline is much different than anything else I've ever seen, and the acting was engaging. I can't wait to see the rest of the movies in the series when they're released!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Finally a movie for the over 50 crowd! Meryl Streep is a great actress.  Any married couple over 50 will appreciate this movie.
B00683JK9K|3.0|I love this app. However, there needs to be an option to save a puzzle if you can't finish it in one sitting. I don't like that you lose the puzzle if you close it out to do something else!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is pretty fun but I think that it is stupid how you can't just buy fresh the character
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Everyone knows this movie is gold, I don't need to add much. Blu-ray is so worth it, it looks absolutely amazing. LOKI!!!
0525953728|5.0|Excellent story of how our Elite forces hunted down and killed the most wanted terrorist in the world!! Do yourself a favor and skip the hollywooded up Zero Dark Thirty and grab this book for the first hand account!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The way the story started I expected something different than it was but turned out better than I expected.  When reading I had a hard time putting it down due to wanting to see what was coming next.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm not much as reader at all, I'm more of a outdoor person but this book made it so I couldn't put it down. It had me flipping page after page.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Movie stands out. I am a Denzel fan. I honestly think he is the greatest actor of all time. Unparalled. He takes this role and owns it.  The side story about another woman almost crashing, I understand why it was there in contrast....but it was unessceary (sp) lol Love the movie. Love Denzel. Good purchase.
0062082353|5.0|Excellent Read!! Pay tribute to a true American hero and order this today!! I promise that you won't regret it!!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This was a fun game that I have yet to master.  I only wish I had more time to play.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This does what the 2nd book in a trilogy should do. The contrasts in scenes / clothes / fashion / culture / technology are very well done, the shocks come unexpectedly, and we are set up for momentous events in the 3rd book.  Also, you're not damned with 'Sword of Shannara' -type in-depth examinations of cultural proclivites of all 13 Districts.  Author keeps those bits short & snappy.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have been a long time fan of the Godfather and this just simply took the cake. I enjoy Mafia movies...and I already have the expensive collection from  long ago that was sold on DVD and with the nice books and everything, but this version on Blu-ray really stands out. Nothing changed, keeps the essence. Oh and delivery was exceptional. Must buy if you're a die hard mafia fan like I am.
0307730697|5.0|Highly suggest this book, the life of Adam Brown is a truely incredible journey! From an addict to devoted husband, father and American hero!! Couldn't put it down from the very first page!!
B001ANYDAO|3.0|Not my normal read, but I did enjoy it.<br />Many thought provoking things to ponder. May read more of his works.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|But the contract said 3 ? Wihout getting into spoilers etc., Katniss could have 'led' the action as she did in number one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Everything NIcholas Sparks writes is awesome!  I read this book in just a couple of hours! Definitely would recommend to everyone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an exciting fast paced game, once you begin playing you become addicted, you never want to put it down!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|So fun! This game is addicting and I love it !!!!! I would recommend it to anyone who likes fun games.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Don't expect the best sound in the world, but for the incredibly cheap price it has allowed me to make great videos with my Iphone 4.  It's cut out the background noise and definitely added a touch of professionalism to my videos.  4/5 for the value factor.
B002NNA9N0|1.0|Horrible waste of my time.  Wish I could get back the 90 minutes spent waiting for something to happen in this movie.
B0014JKJHK|5.0|I love these crocs for work.  Love the fact that they have a slip resistant bottom, so if I happen to need them in a place that I could slip, that feature will be safer.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|It has its funny moments, unlike the others in the series, but everything else was too much like the others. Doors opening without contact, children that don't talk when spoken to, moving toys, etc. I might have jumped once. But other than that, that's about it! It's a decent film.
0061998885|5.0|Can a killer perform his dastardly deed simply by coaxing someone towards death? Making their lives so hopeless and miserable that all that's left for them is to take their own lives?<br /><br />That's the case that old favorites Kenzie and Gennaro are faced with. We get the same old wise-cracking and sharp dialogue between the two as they investigate between Boston's more affluent neighborhoods, mean streets and dead-end motels.<br /><br />Not an easy one to prove, and even if they find the proof, can a killer be charged simply with 'guiding someone towards death'? This gives the thriller a dark and complex edge to lift it way above the standard investigative thriller.<br /><br />Loved the scene where Kenzie and Bubba are arguing the moral toss of whether to kill a guy or not. Even more entertaining because the guy's right in front of them as they argue. My favorite Lehane book along with Mystic River.
B000W91RUG|5.0|One of the best new series in recent times!!! Really love series!!! Would Highly recommend the series to any Sci-Fi comedy lover. Some great written scripts here!!!
B000SGSU58|4.0|I came to Bosch by the back door. I started with the Lincoln lawyer and found a Bosch by accident. It was good to go back to the original. His latter books are better of course.  But this is a really good one.<br />Much of the graphic violence and sex trade made me a bit uncomfortable, but it fit the story and was not gratuitous.
B003521R6G|1.0|Don't turn back the clock if you can avoid it. Doesn't hold up well at all in the current era.
0385339089|5.0|Loved this book. If anything, it comes with an underlying warning for underage teens not to sneak off to grab a cigarette. Because on this one occasion 11 year old Mark Sway and his younger brother see something they shouldn't. A limo parked in the woods as a man commits suicide.<br /><br />But Mark becomes privy to a secret too burdensome for his young shoulders to carry - namely where the body of a recently murdered Senator has been buried - and as the mob killers latch on to Mark, he needs help. Fast!<br /><br />Enter a middle-aged female lawyer more used to family abuse cases, who is way out of her depth with a case with the stakes this high, and from then on it's her and young Mark up against the rest of the world: State investigators, the FBI and the mob. Great thriller, one of Grisham's best.
B003L77G6A|5.0|One of the best new series in recent times!!! Really love series!!! Would Highly recommend the series to any Sci-Fi comedy lover. Some great written scripts here!!!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Unlike Ian McEwan Rachel Joyce brings great sympathy, depth and richness to what are fundamentally middle-class dilemmas. The characterisation is exceptional and the device employed to slowly reveal Harold's motives beautifully executed.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|The game is okay. I like bubble shoot better. I do play both games.the game is great when your waiting in a doctors office.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|This book had a great start. Very atmospheric and really draws you into the menacing atmosphere of this mental institution in the 1950s. But it loses its way and meanders a bit in the middle and so these parts were hard to keep up with.<br /><br />Finally, though the mystery kicks in again and grabbed me and the closing 100 pages were back to the dazzling Lehane form I know and love so well.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|One of the best new series in recent times!!! Really love series!!! Would Highly recommend the series to any Sci-Fi comedy lover. Some great written scripts here!!!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Absolutely loved this from the moment The Sure Thing reference appears (product of my generation). The writing is assured, the he-said she-said device excellently executed and the story compelling. The protagonist is definitely one of the creepiest I have encountered in a long time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Keeps my son occupied, no graphic violence...although the hero is a tagger and running away from the cops is not the most wholesome theme.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I liked the movie a lot better than I thought I would after hearing critics reviews. With the cost of going to movies now days I thought I would wait until Blu ray to see this movie I kind wished I would have saw it on the big screen instead of listening to the critics. Thought the story was fun thrill ride!!!!
B007T99ENE|3.0|I've tried to stay with Ian McEwan but I'm afraid he's just not for me. Atonement was lilting and the story strong, but Saturday left me cold and while Sweet Tooth has a little more to offer ultimately I found the characters a little too cool for me to warm to, the story too much steeped in the troubles of the first-world, middling middle classes once again.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Loved LM when I first saw onstage in high school, and was really excited when it came to screen wth all these favorite actors! I could've bought the soundtrack from the stage version, but I really liked the fact that these movie stars sang the songs.
B0053O89WY|5.0|One of the best new series in recent times!!! Really love series!!! Would Highly recommend the series to any Sci-Fi comedy lover. Some great written scripts here!!!
0670026603|5.0|I read various good and bad reviews and there is quite a range in opinion about this book.  I think most people expect a happy ending to a book, but that's not always the case, as this book proves.  It's a book that makes you think, and left me feeling that if I was in Lou's position, that I myself should not be selfish, that loving someone is more than your own wants and needs.  It is also surrendering to the needs of the one you love, above all else.  People say Will was selfish, but given his situation, no one can judge him unless they've been in his shoes/chair.  Personally, I would not want to feel obligated to stay alive, while mentally and physically suffering, just to satisfy the ones that love me. I think anyone in the state of mind Will was in, definately has the choice to be 'selfish'.  Everyone is selfish in various areas and stages of their life--Will had very few ways to be selfish, even if he wanted to.  I wonder myself what I would do in that situation.  I have said that I do not want to be kept alive by machines if there was no hope for me, but this situation I have not thought about until now.  I think giving your loved ones a window--like Will did, 6 months--was a very unselfish act.  There are various other ways a person could handle the situation.  I couldn't put the book down, and hope one day it is made into a movie.  Not every story has a fairy tale ending, and that is a reality of life...
0307454568|5.0|Read all three books  --  great writing.  Movie wasn't so great.  Don't like subtitles.  New type of series for me to read.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|One of the best new series in recent times!!! Really love series!!! Would Highly recommend the series to any Sci-Fi comedy lover. Some great written scripts here!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are amazing on my S3 I love it. I totally ditched the first version for this one. It's lots of fun with new obstacles!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I can't open them to read. I'm not too savvy with this items but my son couldn't open them either. Maybe I am doing something wrong.
6305535264|5.0|I remember watching this movie about 31 years ago late at night on HBO. It scared me with dark sets and creepy robot. I loved the robot creepy as hell!!! Farrah Fawcett, Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel are great together here. Harvey Keitel in a very early roll very creepy and twisted character. Great Sci-Fi, Horror roller coaster ride.!!!
1452113432|5.0|Love! Love! Love this recipe book, I came across a couple of her cooking shows (originally on BBC) on youtube. Rachel has a passion for french cuisine and has done an amazing job in this cookbook. There are illustrations for almost all the recipes, measurements are in US metric system, and directions are straightforward.  Simple yet delicious! Cant wait to try the madeleines with lemon curd.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This was a good deal on a great addition to my series!  I love this show and collect them all so getting it at a decent price was nice.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|teresa dies..... or does she she might if tomas doesnt but he might but she wont but he will but she wont not
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing! I have never read another book better than this. Everyone should read it. Don't pass this book up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever watched.  Will there be more Season of this show coming out?
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is relaxing and fun :) I like it the best of all the bubble type games that's forsure!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|This album kicks a** from start to finish.  I think she fulfills her self definition as a hip-hop Nancy Sinatra, modern and retro in the same breath.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This movie was so stupid.  I don't even believe that these 2 great actor wasted their time in making this movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This story is very compelling and I love the characters. It was a great read that I could definitely recommend.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|My wife insisted we watch this piece of ***** .  I hated it.  Even she thought is was terrible. REALLY, does Mark Whalberg really need the money so bad that he takes a role like this?  I have seen Whalberg in some outstanding films and hoped there might be some substance to this movie......NOT SO!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Its fun to watch, and certainly hard to wait for the next episode, but I find the whole Bates intrigue very contrived.  Why do the fellow prisoners and the ppolice have it in for Bates?  None of the evidence would have stood upp in a real court.  It's just silly.  However, I watch to find out what will happen next.  Loved the resume.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|designed well and never crashes. very happy with it. especially useful when youre in landscape mode. thanks for keeping it free!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|After seeing the original with &#34;Arnold&#34; I found this poorly done remake to be boring and not even worth watching.  I turned it off after the first half hour.
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|...lacking the slightest ounce of vision, ambition, or the follow through to put as much effort into recreating the dramatic resonance from the page as the visuals.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|A lot better then the movies. I loved the books. I well read them again it took two years I'm gone now
B006MW3V6U|4.0|My wife liked it and watched every episode.  I, however, found it tiresome after the r first 5-6 and stopped watching it.  BUT she and all of her friend LOVED it.  For me I prefer more violence, nudity and intrigue.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Been using this for 6+ months, playing brown noise, waterfall, and wind simultaneously all night long. Works like a charm.  Love it!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|realy enjoyed this movie nothing like a movie based on true events. cuba gooding jr and terrance howard really did there thing, i recommend this film for all.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Even if you don't like SyFy the way the movie explores the time travel paradox is fascinating.  The ending is GREAT.  And Emily Blount is some very nice eye candy.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the different sounds I can listen to, I have tried other apps and this one is my favorite!! Keep up with the good work!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie that is coming out soon to see how true to the book they kept it.  Yet again Nicholas Sparks created to best romance anyone could want!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather channel app is well done.  I use it frequently to look at weather forecasts for my location as well as others I'm interested in.  It stores the locations you want and is easy to access the forecast for each of them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game  a little too fast for me  great buy great fun.<br />all the many things you<br />l  like to find in a game.
B00ADYZTLS|5.0|I love this album by wiz Khalifa it bumps and it never gets old, I recommend this to anyone with subs in there home or vehicle
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I find this app very useful to know how much charge is left in my Kindle battery.  It even speaks to me when the battery level is low or when it's fully charged.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book! It was my 3rd time reading and will definitely read it again.I cant wait for the Entwined to be released!
1844137872|5.0|The book was a gift which was much loved. The delivery was quicker than anticipated and it arrived well packaged and came out of the box in perfect condition. The price was so much cheaper than buying it retail. I would definitely do this again and recommend it as I found the service very satisfactory all in all.
1603425381|3.0|I like and have used some of these borders, but some are pretty dumb.  Also, maybe I'm just old-school, but I have no idea what the pattern diagram things are trying to show, they make no sense to me at all.  Yes, I read the explanations.  They still make no sense, and I am not interested in putting any time into studying how to read them.<br /><br />It's worth buying, but I only find about half of the borders to be anything I would ever use.  Actually, that's not too bad.
1847879071|5.0|It is a brand new book and very very useful! Friendly words and deep thoughts! Although it is so thick, you will read very fast due to plain words.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I enjoyed the read, but having read the first of the trilogy, I expected more from the characters portrayed?<br />....but then I'm not a critic, just a reader.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This was a very godd movie. It was really crafty how the CIA got the hostiges out of where they were being held captive
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|i could not stop reading the book. i will say if you nave not read the book, well go ahead. you willnot regret it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is one of the better games out there. I enjoyed the graphics and music choices as well as the storyline. I would have liked more hidden object games, but all in all, this is one of my favorites.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|For a period drama this has all the aspects that make it riveting viewing. Amazing attention to historical detail and the characterization and story lines are first rate.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this rating because it is an entertaining book u actually feel like k e u are there watching the people sit there and die<br /><br /> I didn't dislike anything about it . It was very good and I can't wait to get the very last book.<br /><br />  By the . Way u need to start getting ready for the movie coming out in November.  It makes u feel like u are getting stabbed when somebody else is getting stabbed. The very last thing in the catching fire book that is said by Gail is their is no district 12. Start getting inspired
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've been playing RPG's and MMO's for years and I've always been a clicker. I decided to try my hand at keybinding and decided that I didn't want to be banging away on my laptop, so I bought this. I've only had this for a couple of days, but I feel my playing getting smoother and more efficient. I find the G13 pretty comfortable to use as well. I can't speak for the durability of the G13 as I've only had it a couple of days, but even if it should break in six months, it's a heck of a lot cheaper to replace than my laptop.

I finally got the time to watch it tonight but it looks like my rental is gone. I'm not going to pay another $4 to see this..how long do you usually get to watch a rented movie?

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I got this game last night on my kindle fire and I didn't dare to play it alone, and I couldn't believe I actually got the game. So when I played it with my friend I felt bad for my kindle because it was being thrown all over the place because slendy kept showing up. and I know for a fact your not suppose to look behind u becuz there is a big chance he will be right there BUT MY FRIEND WAS STUPID ENOUGH TO LOOK BEHIND AND HE WAS LITERALLY INCHES AWAY WITH HIS TENTICLES  FLYING  OVER HIS HEAD AND I WAS PRETTY SURE I WAS ABOUT TO HAV A HEART ATTACK!!!! This game is really scary but it is worth the money, I honestly can't stop playing it because I always need a good scare.  But I heard that there is this annoying glitch for this game on the kindle fire HD but it is a perfect game on the normal kindle fire and it doesn't slow it down. THIS GAME IS FRICKEN AMAZING GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This DVD set is a real treat as it includes all 25 episodes from Series 1-3. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each from the second and third, plus the 2011 Christmas special which was arguably the best single episode so far; it was certainly one of the most dramatic! The less impressive 2012 Christmas Special is also included to round off Season 3.<br /><br />The three series so far have taken us from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to 1920. The circumstances surrounding each series have been in contrast with each other. The first series ran up to the start of the First World War, and the one of the main thrusts of the story line was the matchmaking within the Crawley family and the various financial and social influences on the choice of a suitable partner.<br /><br />The second series moves on to the war years, when Downton Abbey had been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen. The time setting is from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. This background contributes to some very interesting scripts, and whilst some felt that it did not live up to the first series, personally I thought it was excellent, but different.<br /><br />The Christmas special and the third series take place from late 1919 into 1920. The first features a very dramatic trial, and in the third series the household is far more back to the life of an aristocratic family as it was in the first series although the estate faces major challenges in the post war period and a need to embrace change if Downton is to survive. A major feature of the show is the interaction between the family and those who serve them `below stairs' and there are many strong performances amongst both groups. However, a review of Downton would not be complete without mention of Maggie Smith who, as Violet has some very funny lines and dominates every scene she is in. Shirley Maclaine was introduced in the third series, presumably as a foil to Violet, and the rather frosty relationship between the two worked very well. The 2012 Christmas Special takes us to 1921.<br /><br />I am sure that there will be few viewers who have not seen Downton, which is the most successful costume drama since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago. However if there are any out there this will be an excellent introduction to the show for them. Even if, like me, you have seen every episode to date you will enjoy revisiting them. We now know that there will be both a Series 4 and another Christmas Special to look forward to.<br /><br />For those of you interested in extra features, this set includes what was included in the individual DVDs for Series 1,2 and 3. This amounts to over three hours of additional material!he rather frosty relationship between the two worked very well.

B008476HBM|4.0|This is probably the most well known of all Jane Austen's work and I'd never read it before my class assigned it. I'm so happy to now own it on my ipod!
B0034G4P94|3.0|I like this movie, but it is no where near five stars because of several directorial and editing flaws.  Example, when the sportscaster says that Brendan is being thrown like a rag doll . . . well, it is a \\"rag doll,\\" and it is obvious.  Example, when Brendan is leaving his friend's gym office, the transition from inside to outside the office is very bad.  Example, when Brendan is seen on a monitor screen reacting to the fact that his brother will not quit even though his shoulder is separated, it does not work.  The emotional ride, I think, blinds people to errors that hurt the movie severely.  This could have been a AAA movie, but because of several directorial and editing errors, it is a B movie.  That it is rated 8.2 on IMDB amazes me.

0761158820|4.0|This is a fantastic book. Monsters are fun and really varied, and the descriptions are great. I love that they are rated beginner, intermediate and advanced. My 7 and 11 year old sons are steadily working their way through this book, and friends have come over and enjoyed this too. Both of them need some help here and there, although now that they have done a bunch they are pretty independent. It does take some patience, and I HIGHLY recommend either small double stick tape dots (like used in scrapbooking), or quick dry adhesive (scotch makes some), which is like white glue that dries really fast. Otherwise expect them to either come apart easily, or to spend a lot of time holding the pieces together waiting for them to dry.

B007WFR1TE|4.0|Fear Factory's eighth studio album was created using only less-than-half of their original lineup. And not only are there only two original members left in the band, but they couldn't even bring back the drummer, Gene Hoglan, that played on their last effort, 2010's \\"Mechanize.\\" (Divine Heresy's John Sankey takes over behind the trapkit, here, although much of the drumming is programmed using a drum machine, too.)<br /><br />Nevertheless, though, fans everywhere should be hard-pressed to complain very much about \\"The Industrialist,\\" because it is yet another example of how Burton C. Bell and Dino Cazares can still knock out some of the best industrial death/grind in the business. This 2012 effort, like all classic FF releases successfully blends together elements of industrial metal with brutal death metal, thrash, and even grindcore. Therefore, at its heaviest, \\"The Industrialist\\" is quite crushing. But it also comes with generally melodic vocals (from Bell), and several pieces of experimental material -- the kind that Fear Factory have always loved to throw-in. (See previous albums such as \\"Obsolete\\" and \\"Digimortal\\" for further proof of this.)<br /><br />\\"The Industrialist\\" is short, sweet, and to-the-potent point. After all, only ten tracks are presented here, and out of those ten, only seven are actual, fleshed-out songs. The rest are trippy interludes. \\"God Eater,\\" which is an interesting and futuristic-sounding interlude with electronic, new-wavy tinges, is the first of these types of tracks. And then, there is also \\"Religion Is Flawed Because Man Is Flawed,\\" a serene and instrumental soundscape, and the closing \\"Human Augmentation,\\" an ominous, nine-plus-minute long mood-enhancer with cool, distortion-laden vocal effects.<br /><br />The title song makes for a strong opener, even if it does sound like prototypical Fear Factory, with its apocalyptic intro sample, chunky, punching, chugging riffs, and interlocking, machine gun-fast double bass'ing. But tracks like \\"Recharger\\" and \\"Virus Of Faith\\" are familiar FF fair, too , as they both sandwich really memorable and soaring melodic choruses between no-holds-barred brutality (including staccato blasts of blistering guitars and pummeling, grindcore-esque blasting). Elsewhere, \\"New Messiah\\" is an especially thunderous number; and \\"Depraved Mind Murder\\" punishing guitar/drum/bass interplay that successfully creates moving, lumbering, thundering rhythms. \\"Difference Engine,\\" with its almost metalcore-ish breakdowns and cool, surging, stop-start tempos and blast beats, is also of note; and so is \\"Disassemble,\\" as it practically screams \\"mosh-pit anthem.\\"<br /><br />It might not be as classic as, say, \\"Demanufacture\\" or the above-mentioned \\"Obsolete,\\" but, when taken on its own, \\"The Industrialist\\" is a good, strong Fear Factory album. But when considering the fact that FF made it as just two-fifths of a band, it is made even better. It is an enjoyable, consistently very solid, and mostly-satisfying record, and one that is sure to get the pit going.ike \\"Recharger\\" and \\"Virus Of Faith\\" are familiar FF fair, too , as they both sandwich really memorable and soaring melodic choruses between no-holds-barred brutality (including staccato blasts of blistering guitars and pummeling, grindcore-esque blasting).

B0073U2FB2|2.0|It's an alien invasion ... again. This time the story is set in Moscow, where five young people including two Americans, Sean (Emile Hirsch) and Ben (Max Minghella), struggle to survive after the massive attack from the invisible aliens. Co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov known for \\"Night Watch\\" and \\"Wanted,\\" \\"The Darkest Hour\\" has at least one good thing about it: its location. Watching the streets of Moscow in a sci-fi movie is a refreshing experience, even though the film itself is a generic and uninspired one.<br /><br />I said \\"Massive attack,\\" but don't expect eye-popping special effects of \\"Independence Day\\" or Steven Spielberg-directed \\"War of the Worlds.\\" Made with $ 30 million, \\"The Darkest Hour\\" is a comparatively low-budget sci-fi thriller with modest special effects. What is disappointing is the film's run-of-the-mill survival story and flat characters we don't care.<br /><br />After the initial alien attack, the story quickly loses momentum and gets dull, eventually turning into nonsense. And I enjoy watching Roland Emmerich's sci-fi action movies, whose stories are often incredibly silly (Godzilla hiding in New York City, etc.), but never boring. With badly executed ideas (that seem to have been borrowed from somewhere else), \\"The Darkest Hour\\" is after all an unexciting and unoriginal sci-fi film.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Every episode is so unique and they just keep getting better. I love this show!!! They're great to rewatch...I think all of the characters in the show do a great job depicting a modern family. No doubt, you should watch this show.
B0059XTU1S|4.0|After the successful \\"King Kong\\" and poorly received \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" Peter Jackson finally comes back to the world of J. R. R. Tolkien with \\"The Hobbit\\" trilogy, prequel to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" saga. It is safe to say his new film is visually impressive like the previous trilogy, but the film's deliberately paced story, especially its opening 40 minutes, will test the patience of some viewers.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\\" the first installment of the new trilogy, is about Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman, Dr. Watson of UK crime drama \\"Sherlock\\") and his adventure with the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen reprising the role he played in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy) and a group of dwarves to reclaim their land and treasures taken by the dragon Smaug. The film takes too much time introducing the characters, but once they set out on their journey, the story gets faster and better with lots of special effects-laden action sequences.<br /><br />Some of the characters from the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" epic also appear in \\"The Unexpected Journey,\\" including Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Gollum (Andy Serkis), the latter with the Dark Lord Sauron's Ring that Bilbo gives Frodo in \\"Fellowship of the Ring.\\" But you will notice the tone of \\"The Hobbit\\" is more light-hearted than that of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" epic.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\\" if which story precedes that of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy by 60 years, is a journey to where we once visited about ten years ago. For better or for worse, \\"The Hobbit\\" has a feel of familiarity, and could have been better with more focus on the journey, but still it is engaging.
0446554995|5.0|True to the Preston and Child tradition of fabulous books. We would recommend this book to anyone who loves intrigue and action
B004U8VWIM|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie, based upon all the comments and feedback I've heard over the past year or so.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to choppy and generally poor streaming integrity, there were too many moments where the scene paused (sometimes for several minutes!) or equally distracting the audio and video became out of sync.  It was near impossible to remain in the mindset of losing oneself in the entertainment when the medium was front and center (and acting like a petulant child that demanded attention!).<br /><br />Maybe it will become available on Netflix or I'll physically rent a disc - either way, this experience leaves me reluctant to waste money on another HD movie from Amazon.
B008OJ291W|5.0|If you like E.L.O. then you can't help but like this cd.  It has all the old favorites from the group and the songs bring back the memories too.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I'm pretty picky when it comes to movies - I hate wasting time and in some cases lots of money to sit through 1-2 hours of a work of art (if you can even call it that sometimes) that clearly wasn't given much thought in terms of story, plot, character development, music, script, pacing, scenery, etc.<br /><br />I don't remember even really noticing Tangled when it came out, I think if I did see the trailer, I may have completely over looked it, because it looked like a disney-dreamworks-shrek attempt filled with PG jokes. (which I can appreciate if it's well made, but didn't seem to go good with a Disney princess movie)<br /><br />But when I stumbled (pretty much by accident) on this movie because of a Christmas gift this last year, I was blown away.  The story, pacing, music, everything is so good.  You can really tell that lots of people, spent lots of time, putting lots of attention on this movie.  There were some distractions - sometimes the dialogue was a little out of place (think southern Californian slang spoken in a 1780's fairy tale world) but it was very minor and for better or for worse was very funny.  The whole thing felt like a classic Disney movie like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, or The Little Mermaid, with that much attention to story, charm, character, music, and 'Disney magic', but with modern polish on it.  This 'modern polish', I think is what gives the movie lasting quality.  It's definitely a movie you can watch over and over, because there's so much attention to detail.  The movie moves with no drag from scene to scene - everything is important, and somehow the mix of classic 2D Disney design with the 3D CGI gives the characters and the fairy tale world they live in such a pleasant feeling that you'll want to visit it over and over again.<br /><br />The Indiana Jones adventure scenes are what first got my attention,....then the warm, developed characters and story got me hooked, and it's the CGI and attention to detail that will make me watch this again and again, knowing I'll notice something new each time.<br /><br />Easy, 5 stars.
1781161097|5.0|What can be said about Ridley Scott's contribution to film? He single handedly started the ALIEN franchise! Having him revisit this subject was the best thing that could have happened! The film brought new life to this story,and new controversey. Everybody I know who saw it had a different take on it. I loved it! Buying the book was a no brainer for me. I couldn't wait to see the production work that went into the movie. This book doesn't disappoint! I bought a second copy for a friend. I couldn't wait to share it!

B006BAEQB2|5.0|I gave  this book five stars because I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Phillipa Gregory is just a master at historical fiction and this one was no exception. I found it to be a real page turner with plausible characters and excellent development of them and the plot. Especially with historical fiction, when you already know how it's going to end, that fictional \\"why\\" is so much more important to keep your interest. This one did.
0062238310|5.0|Julian Fellowes has crafted a wonderful book of the scripts from Season One of the hit show.  This includes whole scenes and huge amounts of dialogue that were not filmed or were cut.  (These portions are unobtrusively indicated by a bar to the left side of the script.) While some of it may not have been strictly necessary for the show, it's all of great interest to read and expands our knowledge of the characters, their back-stories and the goings-on at the manor.  But the best part of the book are the extensive notes, remarks and comments by Lord Fellowes. I learned a lot about English country life and other matters, and it is fascinating to become privy to the creative process of this gifted and entertaining writer.  I hope the later seasons are similarly published.  Yes, I loved watching the series very much, but I promise you that this fine volume will extend your enjoyment in many directions.  A surpassingly fine entertainment!

B003L77GG0|4.0|I rated this a 4 because it wasn't too bad of a series. Like many fans out there I wish the producers would had made another season of Smallville. But that's probably me talking.<br />What I didn't like about this is the fact that the last episode on this season felt all rushed. Maybe a few other episodes may have been this way but it seemed that in a space of time the creators were pushing everything in this last episode.<br />I would recommend this to anyone but prepare for some disappointments in this season.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is fun to play. It's tricky and in some parts of the game it is really easy. It kept me occupied for a while. Great game and I recommend it to everybody that likes puzzles and challenges!

B006VSP906|3.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed most of Hitchens work but this book disappointed. It was really an account of a patient suffering from terminal cancer and the process of his treatment.  There was not a lot of insight about his own internal struggles and his emotional feelings about his impending death.  I liked the chapter written by his wife.  It gave me a little insight into him as a husband and father.

B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I agree with several of the reviews that spoke to the book being less than par for Preston and Child.  I enjoy Pendergast however his character was disjointed, as well as the story.  It was just ok.  I bought another Preston and Child after finishing this one - Pendergast is his wonderful self and this must just be a glitch in the colaboration. Paula
B00B92ZO3G|5.0|I bought To Sell is Human because I have been self employed for about a year and my business was missing something. I was marginally successful but I needed something to boost my client list.  My businesses revolve around selling Antiques and clothing on Ebay and Craigslist and I also offer guitar lessons to the public, so it is very much a sales oriented field. I realized that the problem with my client list was the overall way I conducted my ads and myself. After reading To Sell is Human, I was instantly endowed with concepts that were previously non-existent in my work.<br />Being a person who is commonly pressed for time, I bought the summary version and it contained more than enough info for me to kick sales into overdrive. The book taught me that successful sales do not rely on tacky sales pitches or coercion, but are instead motivated by eliciting trust and a sense of commonality with my clients.  The best part of the book is the chapter on Attunement, which describes many techniques for initiating rapport with, would be clients. Since buying the book I have seen a healthy increase in the number of sales and lessons I receive. These concepts were in front of me the whole time; I just needed to read this book to realize it. A definite buy!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|It's hard to get into the subject without giving away the story, so I won't go there.  I thought this was going to be about a normal love story, and I was way wrong.  Instead, it was truly thought provoking, delightful, and terribly sad at the same time.  Definitely a book for Book Clubs because it brings about a lot of soul searching and conversation. Meaningful characterization, great flow., great story.  I highly recommend this book.

B004EPYZOO|3.0|CAGE IS AN OUTSTANDING ACTOR AND SHOULD PICK BETTER MOVIES TO STAR IN<br />WHY WOULD ANY ONE WANT TO DRIVE ANGRY?
030758836X|3.0|To me the theme of this book was not the rocky marriage, or the relationships of the characters in the novel.  The theme as I see it is that we all create fragmented versions of our selves to deal with everyday life.  We have work us, married us, boys/girls night out us, dinner party us, drinking party us, sports event us, movie night us, so on and so forth.  The book stressed time and time again people playing roles to achieve some goal.  Amy acted like the \\"cool girl\\" to be with Nick, Nick acted like \\"cool guy\\" to be with Amy.  People feed of these types of interactions.  I thought the ending made perfect sense within the context of Amy and Nick's relationship.  There was no happy ending for them nor was there a tragic ending.  The only option for these two people was to continue doing what they know how to do.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|IT IS A DENZEL WASHINGTON MOVIE BUT RYAN RENOLDS MAKE IT A WHOLE LOT MORE INTRESTING I EXPECT<br />VERY SOON HE BECOME A BIG STAR
B00B0NDF26|5.0|To deny the \\"pop\\" sound Tegan and Sara bellish out in Heartthrob is most certainly denial.  This is how pop music at its finest is credited.  To have grown up in the 80's and 90's when pop music was at it's creative peak, I can call this album a pop perfection.  Every song on this album could be a single.  The careful choice of choosing the order of songs is obvious, giving this album a perfect pattern.  It's okay to like pop music if this is in your playlist.  There's nothing about selling out with this item.  Don't be a follower of the denial percent.

076115678X|5.0|I LOVE this book. I loved the original book. I was finally at the point where I was accepting and embracing my curls when I discovered the original Curly Girl Handbook. The tips and techniques in both books have helped me to LOVE MY CURLS. I honestly can't remember the last time I straightened my hair. Every curly girl should have this book; even if you don't use all the techniques, you'll appreciate the natural beauty that is you. I buy this book for just about all of my curly friends/family.

B008476HBM|5.0|This is my very favourite book of all time and I shall most likely read it again and again until I know it by heart. I recommend it to anyone and everyone in hopes that they should have the pleasure of being affected by it as I have.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a journey!  This was an intriging story of survival with a sense of humor.  I'd recommend it for a great weekend read.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|I'm a big fan of historical fiction and this story line was so far removed from reality I thought it's going to be a bomb or pretty entertaining and I'm happy to report it was the latter!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughter recommended the book.  It seems everyone was reading it.  The first two were great.  I thought the author struggled to come up with the ending, but all in all, it was entertaining and fun!  Is this what will happen if we go over &#34;the cliff&#34;?
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Perfect for filtering out sounds around me so I can concentrate. Very good selection of sounds. Also like being able to download others.
B006H4DBA4|4.0|perfect length to sit and have an indulgent period of reading. some food for thought and nice reflection on our world as well as light entertainment.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|The other Angry Birds was fully played out. It was time to get something else. This version really looks good on the Kindle HD; nice vivid colors, crisp scenes. And the new Bird types, along with association with Star Wars figures, is a plus. How can you go wrong? It's another flock of Angry Birds!!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Very different from the movie but it's good. For free you can't go wrong. It's nice light easy reading for just before bed. I've yet to notice any grammatical errors like you find a lot of times.
B009329Y30|5.0|Haven't watched the movie yet, but delivery was quick and ease of ordering was awesome.  Definitely recommend seller.  Digital copy offered made it easy for watching quickly although we didn't take advantage of it.
B001OFJPIS|1.0|They don't have a feature where you can click on for subtitled so I ordered a movie that I couldn't watch. It was not cool.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Been a fan of Fleetwood Mac for a long time, but I finally got around to listening to this album for the first time this year. I think everyone listening to this was expecting the band to recreate the magic of Rumors. But with Christine McVie gone, the dynamics have changed. This is more like a Buckingham/Nicks album. The production values on this are excellent, even 10 years later this sounds fresh and modern. I am already on my second listen through this album, it's amazing. Don't hesitate to pick up a copy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the most fun game in the universe!!!!!!! bored and looking for a fun app?!?!? get this one!!!!!! and...... ITS FREEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002QUWYWE|5.0|I love this movie,one of Stephen Kings best.I have seen this movie many times,and never get tired of seeing it.You can't beat the shipping charges.Amazon is the best!
0439023491|5.0|The first book was excellent; the other two in the trilogy dwindle down to places that aren't particularly engaging.  I really much preferred the &#34;Divergent&#34; trilogy I read after this.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Love, love, love the songs sung by Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio, especially 'If I Didn't Know Better&#34;.  'Sideshow' (Charles Esten) and 'No One Will Ever Love You' (Charles Esten, Connie Britton) are great, and Hayden Panettiere can sing!  Always suspected the coach's wife was multi-talented (I realy miss Friday Night Lights), but who knew the the Heroes Cheerleader could do this well?
0439023513|4.0|Good but rather disappointing ending to the series; I wish I could have liked it more.  But there you go.  I enjoyed the &#34;Divergent&#34; series more and REALLY like to &#34;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; trilogy if you haven't read them.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Great characters, great script.  Spend a &#34;night in the box&#34; watching this movie.  Strother Martin is great as the &#34;Captain&#34;.
0439023521|5.0|Read the book even if you've seen the movie.  You'll understand the movie much more if you do.  This book was excellent but I thought the movie was just okay.  You won't believe everything that's left out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|um fun and addicting not sure of what else to say I'm not a critic ha ha ha ha lol
B0058FW06Y|5.0|This is the type of movie you can watch over and over. Every time I watch it I catch more and more of the story line. Well done and well acted.<br /><br />Worth the time to watch!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is awesome! Looks great on my Kindle Fire. I like that it's a little more challenging than the first one. Only downside is a couple small glitches in the game freezing it up
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Very fun and challenging flying game for android. There are some others out the from this Author, and I have played them. It doesn't have much to the game but it is very fun to kill some time.

B001P06GX4|4.0|Very neat game but man it is very cheaply made. The pieces are made well but the plastic board is so cheaply made. Fun game though. Its got a lot of different modes to play.
1595825045|4.0|This book is more targeted towards kids and people who want a minor look behind the scenes.  Much of the art is too small to be fully enjoyed but the early evolution from idea to execution of Season 1 is very insightful.  I wish there had been more discussion of the stories of the voice actors and of the character stories that did not make it into the episodes.  What is here though is entertaining, if light.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am amazed this show was on TV.  It is beautifully cast, directed and produced.  The sets are gorgeous and it is so nice to immerse myself is sophistication.  The cast is perfect and Maggie Smith is hysterical.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Currently on day 15 and down 10 pounds.  Love how challenging it is at the beginning and just as you're getting used to the workouts, you switch it up a level.  Great workout for those like me getting back in to the swing of things!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|A little slow starting, but gripping all the way to the surprise ending!!  Clean and thoroughly enjoyable. A good read.
B00B2166BS|3.0|I ordered my magnector (pogo) cable directly through the manufacturer website on Jan 22 (order # 1575). I received update on Jan 23 that my item was shipped from S.Korea (RR446280841KR). Per manufacturer website, item should take 7-15 days to ship to North America. It's now been 16 days since item shipped and i still don't have it. What's worse is their is no easy way to email or call the manufacturer (only local s.Korean phone number and address is provided for contacting this company) no international phone number, online customer service form, or customer inquiry email address is provided. If i don't receive my item by this saturday, i will proceed in canceling my order and/or disputing my purchase through my credit card company.<br /><br />Update: my cable was finally delivered on feb 19. It took over 28 days for my cable to ship from south Korea to my door. If you order this product be prepared to wait a while. Otherwise, the cable is working fine. It charges my nexus a little faster then the standard USB cable. Overall, i like this pogo cable and would refer others to use it. It just stinks how long it takes the item to ship.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I think this book needs a part two. Felt like it left me hanging. But overall it was a page turner.
1609611543|5.0|This book changed my life. It showed me I have a wheat allergy. I.no longer have stomach pain. As a bi product I have lost weight..Yes i will be very careful with what i eat for the rest of my life. Loved it so much I bought 3 more for family who suffer the same.
0738212415|5.0|It has been years since I decided to take a course on drawing. I signed up for a BEGINNER course and the instructor put a boquet of flowers up and said 'draw them'. I said if I knew how to draw them i wouldn't be here ina beginner class!! But this book is excellent. I have leafed through it and have completed to lesson 5 and I am so impressed how much I have learnt so far. HUGS to the author - thank you so much!!
B006O6F932|1.0|Too bad having to pick 1 star, it's not worth that. Kept falling apart, not what I expected at all. Will not recommend.
030758836X|3.0|I didn't like the novel at all when I started. It jumped back and forth between characters, but I finally got into it about a forth of the way through. It kept me engaged after that.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|A book that I would defiantly read a second time as it was such a pleasure the fist time road.
B008OB1QFK|5.0|Everything expected was received.  No complaints. The CD arrived in a timely fashion; I think sooner than projected.  No damage.  No issues.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Original storyline I loved as well as the unexpected but realistic ending.  The acting made the story believeable. Loved the simplicity of the setting and the relationship of the characters. Levitt and Willis are great.
B0031RS64G|5.0|I read twice the whole serie and my first impression remains: they are a masterpiece of modern fantasy. The second time I enjoyed much more the use of the language, the  whole structure of the books and the depth of the characters ideology. Somehow feels like they are written to  challange the lector in more ways than just looking in a dictionary for unknown words.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This was an excellent movie it was obvious the actors enjoyed making. Good story, chemistry and the acting was excellent.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I get bored on this easily.  honestly u have to have no life in order to like this... in my opinion.  Sucky!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|The download was good but there is no way to know what page you are on which is difficult when one has a limited amount of time to read for pleasure.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love everything about this game both of my kids love to play it( as do i lol) great graphics and gameplay very realistic
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Martin continues his story telling of the apparently never ending saga about a history that never<br />existed. Still, highly recommended if you are a GOT fan.
1592402038|4.0|Writer/author makes it plain and easy to follow along with the examples offered in the book. Definitely a good reference tool for writers/literates.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This one is the best of the 3. It ties together the 1st movie and brings  a suprise ending you will really appreciate.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was so mad at myself for reading this book against my better judgement,after all it's an Oprah book. I don't ever like her picks,so shame on me for going against my gut. The characters left me cold,couldn't warm up to them.First few chapters I knew it was a bust. He is a self centered man child and she was stupid to even be with him.Even though this is a familiar theme in some relationships,I had no desire to suffer through their doomed marriage and even less patience with their families.I disliked every character in this book. And the ending made me even more upset that I wasted my time on this empty novel.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Ice Age series and this one wasn't a dissapointment. The story line is good and anticiption is good throughout.
B00AKCJB44|5.0|Everything I expected and more! The soundtrack is as awesome as the movie!!! This was money well spent!! I will definitely reccommend to others!!!
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|Decided to go with Condor chest rig because I've had good success with manufacturer. Buyer should be aware that this is made in China and the sewing on the pouches is questionable as to the mag pouches to the actual rig. I knew this from the start after seeing a review of the chest rig on youtube. As soon as the rig arrived I took it to the local boot store and had them resew the pouches to the vest for about 5.00. Now the rig is sturdy So if you decide to purchase this rig make sure you have the mag pouches reinforced. Overall about 40.00 tied up in what is now a quality chest rig.
1938750977|5.0|This paranormal/science fiction book had me spellbound from start to finish---I ended up reading it in a couple of evenings. It seems to take place in the past, the present, and the future all at the same time. Ophelia is the main character, a lovely young girl, who unfortunately has the mark of the serpent on her shoulder. And then it goes on from there in a fast and thrilling pace. I loved the book and read it from cover to cover in a couple of evenings. I highly recommend it----you can not go wrong with this thrilling book. Buy it! Thumbs Up!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my first watch in years, and I was looking for something simple, attractive, and reliable.  I also didn't want to have to fuss with a battery or winding anything.  Since receiving the watch, it has rarely left my wrist.  Setting the time is a little tricky, as you have to turn the wheel backwards a little to stop the second hand from moving.  It would be a lot better if the second hand would stop moving as soon as you pulled it out.<br /><br />When I first received the watch, it was 2-3 minutes fast a day.  I took it to a local watchmaker and had it regulated.  After 3 weeks, it varies between 2-3 seconds off my radio synced atomic clock.  I'm very impressed, and I don't think you can ask for much more in an automatic watch at this price point.  For all of you who are having problems with accuracy, I'd highly recommend getting your watch regulated.  It cost me around $15.<br /><br />I feel like the face is the perfect size, and it is attractive to me.  I'm not a fashion expert, but I think it's probably conservative enough to go with any outfit.  I've knocked the thing around a bit, and I haven't noticed any blemishes yet.<br /><br />The power reserve on mine seems to be about 2.5 days.  I've never had trouble keeping it going, and have made no special efforts to keep it wound.  If I do let it wind down, I just swing it back and forth for a few seconds, set the time, and put it on.<br /><br />The only thing I was not impressed with was the glow in the dark paint they used on the hands.  It doesn't stay bright for very long, and all you get for the hour markings are unlabled dots.  It is surprisingly difficult to tell what the 12 oclock position is in the dark, which makes telling time in the dark take much longer than it should.<br /><br />tl;dr<br />Pros<br />-Accurate<br />-Light<br />-Reliable<br />-Durable<br />Cons<br />-Difficult to read in the dark<br />-May need regulation
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I received this book through a twitter giveaway and as I told the author I loved it! Sophia is the perfect heroine because she is tough but not cold. Many books have super tough girls that are like warrior tomboys or have whiny prissy girly girls who can't save themselves. Sometimes Sophia needs help, but other times she is the one to save the day. She's tough but still a typical girl. It made me feel like anyone can find the strength in themselves to face anything, so for that reason I fell in love with this book and this character because it was entertaining and inspiring!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is excellent. The graphics are great and there is plenty to do.  The gameplay is simple but fun. :)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed reading Defending Jacob tremendously.  I finally decided to read it after several of my coworkers raved about it.
B00004WPFX|5.0|I've been wanting for this album for some time now and I'm glad to have waited to receive the vinyl version! To any Daft Punk fans out there this is a must have item.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this is a very fun game at first but when I downloaded it to my kindle fire it was fine for 4 days. today when I tried to open it the game won't get past the loading screen before it closed it self off. so it's fun but I would not say that u should load it onto the kindlefire
B000059MEL|5.0|Super glad to have picked up my second Daft Punk album! This is nothing short of amazing. And nothing beats a freshly sealed vinyl waiting for you when you get home!
B00006HAZG|4.0|David Copperfield, 1999 film<br /><br />The story begins in an English village where a coffin is carried along a country lane. Miss Betsy Trotwood visits Widow Copperfield, who soon gives birth to a son. Young David had a happy childhood until his mother found a second husband. David and Pegotty go on a vacation to Yarmouth by the sea, and meet her family. They live in a ship that is on the land. When he returns he meets his new father! There is a new housekeeper now, Edward's sister Jane Murdstone. Clara is surprised. David is sent to bed. Edward corrects David's behavior in a firm or harsh manner by caning him! He is kept locked in his room for seven day. [Did David have friends his own age?] Miss Pegotty leaves. David is sent away and receives hard treatment. [Do children pack up and pick on a new boy?] His hands are whipped. Steerforth befriends him. School discipline is harsh.<br /><br />When David returns home he finds a younger brother. He has learned manners. Then he returns to school and learns his mother has died. Pegotty is fired from her job, and marries Mrs. Barkus. Mr. Murdstone sends David to London to earn a living in a factory. He is taken to a new home, Micawber's family. David learns to bargain. Micawber is sent to Debtor's Prison. Misery comes from being in debt. David sells his clothes for money to travel to Dover. He makes the mistake of trusting a stranger, who robs him! David must walk all the way to Dover to meet his aunt Betsy. Mr. Dick is an odd character wh advises Betsy. Betsy tells off Murdstone and his sister Jane. David will go to a new school and board with Mr. Whitfield, aunt Betsy's lawyer. Betsy offers advice to David, who meets Agnes and Uriah Heep. The years pass, David and Agnes are grown up. David will enter business as a clerk (for a price of £1,000). Next he finds lodgings. Months later he meets Dora, the owner's daughter.<br /><br />David is invited to Dora's picnic. He fell in love. He meets Agnes again, and Steerforth. Uriah Heep tells David about Whitfield's business. David meets Micawber again. He goes to visit Steerforth, and invites him to travel to Yarmouth. Steerforth looks down on his inferiors. David meets Pegotty and Barkus again. Emily is to marry Ham. Steerforth buys a boat. Micawber has a new job with Uriah Heep. Betsy Trotwood has lost her fortune through bad investments. David tells Dora about this. [Is she practical?] David talks to Agnes about his plans. Whitfield complains about Heep's actions. Agnes says goodbye. Spendlow tells David to forget Dora. His sudden death creates a problem. David learns Emily has left Ham to go away with Steerforth! Steerforth's mother is also distressed. David learns the Spendlow company went bankrupt! Dora is destitute.<br /><br />David wrote articles that were bought and published, a new career. He married Dora. Their cook is lacking in skills. [Should a man chose a wife just on looks?] The search for Emily continues. [We see how the upper class treats common people.] Back in Yarmouth a ship runs aground and begins to sink. Can a man be saved? The bodies lie upon the sands. David tells the news to Mrs. Steerforth. There is a meeting at the Whitfield home where Micawber accuses Heep of embezzling from Betsy Trotwood. Heep explains his actions. Will Micawber consider immigration to Australia? Something will turn up. The ship also takes prisoners exiled to Australia. At home Dora is in failing health. Agnes arrives with news. David works at his writing and finishes a book; it is successful. David meets Agnes again. Will there be a happy ending? Yes.<br /><br />Charles Dickens was famous for his characters. There are some lessons in this story. I never read the book, others can comment on this movie version. Books are adapted to movies, there is simplification and condensation. Was this story based on Dicken's own personal experiences? This story shows human life and the lessons or warnings from their activities. This movie generally shows David hatless, a strange habit in those times.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book was interesting but not as good as other books on this subject. Not as personal as others again.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Definitely top 10 movie of 2012.  Tone is perfect.  Action is well done.  Pacing is spot on.  Make a sequel!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great writing and good story-good action. Lee Child usually doesn't make mistakes, but some in this book distracted from the story. Mistakes were made about guns and ballistics; Also<br />about US currency, which is central to the plot.
B00A8306XK|3.0|Limited, 180 Gram Audiphile Rare Mono Edition, pressed at RTI on Premium HQ-180 Vinyl.  I have comments on the technical side. The fourth song is heard repeating crash. Cover without individual numbers!!! Just a shame.

B003P2WO5E|5.0|I would recommend this book, furthermore this author to anyone. I love the way he writes. It completely pulls you in to the story. He is one of my favorites and also check out Mistborn trilogy. It was the best trilogy Ive ever read.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|My 3 1/2 year old son loved this movie.  We just let him watch it for the first time, and he enjoyed it.  It is a classic!
B000JVTCEK|1.0|The 2 disc special edition was clean, but it was not a comparable match with any of my devices except my computer where I could change the reading code. we tried everything from blueray. to dvd to xbox. nothing worked.

0770435726|3.0|3.5/5<br /> Chris Pavone's debut novel The Expats has been nominated for an Edgar Award - Best First Novel. And with good reason - it's a real page turner.<br /><br />Kate Moore has a secret - she's worked for the CIA since she left college. Along the way, she decided she wanted a family and married Dexter. Nice, safe, comfortable Dexter - of course she fully investigated him. And they've been blessed with two little boys. When Dexter gets a job offer in Luxembourg as a banking security specialist, Kate decides it's finally time to quit and just be a mom and wife. But can one really ever leave that kind of life behind? Will the past let you quit? And is your husband really who you thought he was?<br /><br />Kate joins the ranks of the expats in Luxembourg, trying to learn the language, navigate a new country and deal with the loneliness -  Dexter's job keeps is keeping him away from home more and more. For a male writer, I thought Pavone nailed Kate's emotions - the boredom, the frustration, the loneliness, the uncertainty that she's made the right choice.  But old habits die hard and Kate finds herself second guessing everyone she comes into contact with.<br /><br />Secrets is the name of the game here - everyone has them and the winner is the one who can figure them out first. Pavone certainly keeps the reader on their toes. He's chosen to tell the story in two narratives - past and present. Different typefaces help us distinguish which is which, but I will admit that I had difficulty in the beginning. In the present day narratives, we (mostly) know what has happened. Switching back to the past, we know more that Kate does as she tries to figure things out. But we still don't know it all - Pavone provides lots of twists to keep the story moving.<br /><br />I enjoyed having a woman as a protagonist in a 'spy' novel and I liked Kate as a character. There were a few times when an obvious clue seemed to elude her that I thought was out of character, but this is a minor complaint.<br /><br />The Ex-Pats was an excellent cat and mouse game, with the roles changing constantly between four main players. I can see this as a movie.r complaint.<br /><br />The Ex-Pats was an excellent cat and mouse game, with the roles changing constantly between four main players. I can see this as a movie.
0393343405|5.0|&#34;The Swerve: How the World Became Modern,&#34; is a fascinating and extremely readable account of how, in the early 1400s', a scholarly hunter of ancient books found in a remote monastery a copy of &#34;On the Nature of Things&#34;. a 7000 line poem believed to have been  written  in about 324 BCE  by the athenian Epicurus.  Epicurus' original writings are lost, but were re-copied and preserved into about 50 BCE, when they were translated into latin by Lucretius.  Epicurus is critical of superstition and the potent wickedness of organized &#34;Religion.&#34;  He advocates that humans and all the universe are composed of indestructible atoms - and that there is neither heaven nor hell,  a philosophy that the Church of Rome unsurprisingly declared to be heretical.  Nevertheless, Lucretius' re-discovered writings began to spread so that by the Reformation, they  were read widely, as shown by the works of Montaigne - and Thomas Jefferson, who, as author of the Declaration of Independence, made the Epicurean principle of the pursuit of happiness, a centerpiece of American democracy!

1592407889|1.0|\\"It's a painful moment for me as a mother and as someone who values the truth. I'm shocked and heartbroken that my daughter would make statements about me that are virtually all fiction. I've praised her lovingly and truthfully in my own autobiographies. I'm sorry to see such a dishonest, opportunistic effort from my daughter for whom I've only ever wanted the best.\\" - Shirley MacLaine
1423113454|5.0|This is a good book for people who enjoy light fantasy like me.There is no sex or and I don't think any cussing .
0439023513|3.0|I didn't enjoy these books at all.  I read them because I was reading them with a student I tutor.  I found Katniss fatuous and boring as a character.  Peeta and Gale had a lot more going for them, as did Prim, and Finnick. Even Haymitch was more interesting. Cinna was a more intriguing person, who took great risks, but he's tossed off with hardly a care. The action scenes were pretty good, which is why I give the book/s three stars.  The whole time I was reading them, however, I felt like they could have been condensed into one and that would have made a much better story. Cut out all of Katniss's self-serving introspection and then the books would hum along a lot better.  Aside from these issues, I really find the idea of children killing children for the sport and viewing pleasure of adults reprehensible, and that the books' intended audience is children, even more so.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books and enjoyed them very much. While this film like most did not stay true to the book it was closer than I hoped.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|After reading all these other reviews and then buying the blu-ray trilogy myself I can now confirm that there is nothing wrong with the quality of these movies. They are well worthy of being called Blu-ray, the quality is most excellent. I can't help but wonder and bet that 50-75% of the people who bitched about the quality have older tv's and have not bought anything made more recent that supports 1080p quality which truly brings out the blu ray quality to it's best.<br /><br />To sum it all up, great movies, great quality, and a great purchase.

B003O86FMW|3.0|Good book just not as good as the first one. I'm hoping that the third book is better and can't wait to finish reading it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have this game on my ipad and kindle and both games are amazing. if you love games with goals and you live animals then get this game.
B00005Q5WC|5.0|Great sound and great songs.  Loved the live versions of Exodus, Punky Reggae Party and Baldhead.  Quite a strong collection and much better than downloading over the net.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use the Alarm clock extreme for taking my medication. I take different types at different times, so with this alarm clock I can set the Alarm and give it a title like what medication I am taking. It also has a feature where the Alarm starts off softly and it slowly gets louder as it goes, so it doesn't scare the earthworms out of you, which I really enjoy.
0062183591|5.0|I am a huge proponent of honesty, but I found myself surprised at how often little lies and cheats slip into our lives. This book is a good reminder of why this happens and how to stay honest.<br /><br />Here's my quick summary of the book: joyofhonesty.com/2013/02/03/dan-ariely-honest-truth-about-dishonesty/
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I just received my BK2 and I wanted an alternative to my Gerber LMF2, which I love, but the serrations bugged me a bit as I only used them on occasion but on this size of a knife it takes half of the blade. I have never batoned large wood with the LMF2 and when comparing the two knives I can tell which one I will feel good about abusing. The rubber handles on the LMF2 are comfortable but will damage easily if you aren't careful. The BK2 seems like I could just beat the stuffing out of it and take more.<br /><br />The BK2 is hefty in comparison, the thicker blade and handles without the serrations make this a true brute. I have loaded comparison pictures in the photos area and really like the BK2. I do like the weight of the LMF2 but once I get this beast out in the woods, I'll be able to see which one I plan to use as my go to knife. As you can see in the pictures they are exactly the same length and the BK2 has a much thicker blade and handle.<br /><br />I think I'll either order the micarta handles, or just stipple the inner part of the existing handle.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good for young boys and girls, mom's like it too! The riding part is fun and the feeding. Good for mindless fun.
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|I am a big fan of Riverside and regard them as one of the best newer prog bands on the planet.  They are always evolving and now have more of a modern 70's style rock sound.  Anyone else feel a \\"My Sharona\\" vibe through the first part of \\"Feel Like Falling\\", or the 70's style southern rock/Deep Purple riffs on \\"Celebrity Touch\\" or \\"Escalator Shrine\\"?  Riverside is spicing it up and the metal-ish riffs I love are almost nonexistent on this release.  Not a bad thing, just different.  Something else that is different is the acoustic guitar on \\"The Depth of Self-Delusion\\" and \\"Coda\\".  It adds a refreshing change of sound and Piotr is strumming chords, which is rare.<br /><br />As usual the band is tight, the musicianship is spot on, and the mix is superb - although the distorted vocals on \\"New Generation Slave\\" and parts of \\"Celebrity Touch\\" bug me.  Mariusz is a killer vocalist so I don't understand why they alter his singing with distortion.  I don't feel this effect adds any oomph or balls to these songs.  Is this just me, does it bother anyone else?<br /><br />Overall, disc one is loaded with catchy songs, not one dud track.  Right now I'm favoring the two ballads on the album: \\"Deprived\\" and \\"We Got Used to Us\\" which is strange because I usually like the heavier material better.  \\"Deprived\\" has such a cool trippy rhythm that sucks me into a comfy place, and I want to stay there.  The sax solo and keyboards tinkling in the background near the end really put this tune over the top for me.  Almost jazzy!  \\"We Got Used To Us\\" reminds me a bit of \\"Conceiving You\\", one of my favorites from \\"Second Life Syndrome\\".  The walking bass line on this tune is awesome and reminds me that Mariusz is a killer bass player.<br /><br />The second disc is not that great.  The first track is keyboard oriented, very repetitive with lots of ambience that drones on and on.  The second tune sounds like they improvised over a programmed drum beat - again with lots of ambience.<br /><br />Forme, the ultimate Riverside is \\"Anno Domini High Definition\\".  But I like all their releases and look forward to many more.  Rock on Riverside!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This app is force closing on all four of my devices. S3, Note2, ipad 2 & ipad 4. Fun game when it works.

B004S3X9ZS|5.0|Excelente disco, me parecen unos disc&iacute;pulos muy elegantes de New Order, las l&iacute;neas de bajo est&aacute;n precisas y contundentes, los arreglos exquisitos. Me encant&oacute;, uno de los mejores de ese a&ntilde;o.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I really like this game, especially that it was free. I have a lot of fun playing this game and it doesn't really get old. If you were wondering if it is a good game, it is. I would definitely get it. It is worth it.
B003N0XDT4|2.0|The minute I got this product I loved the sound quality it produced. The base boost was great and it really made a difference in my music. As long as it was plugged in, it produced great sound quality like it advertises.<br /><br />However, the product I received had a dead battery. I charged it for days and the second I unplugged it it shut off. I wanted to use this for my iPod, so this product would have been perfect! Unfortunately, the battery was dead so I could only use it for my computer. I saw a few reviews that said the same thing before I purchased it. Dead battery? Oh well, I'll take a gamble, maybe mine will work. I lost, my product also had a dead battery..<br /><br />Another thing I noticed is that it had some electronic noise when I listened to it with my computer. I'm not sure if it was because it was charging or not. If your headphones were producing sound, you could hardly notice the noise, but if nothing was playing you could hear the noise again and it was rather annoying.<br /><br />Be careful, I would recommend buying another product from FiiO than this one, unless you would like to gamble and see if you get a dead battery or not.
B0032CVAQQ|2.0|Easy to read. The Author doesnt come up with anything new that hasnt already been written before but at least his making his topic more readable - must admit I only made it half way thru the book because there was nothing new..
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a great high quality product and shipped quickly.  Very very good deal I would highly recommend to anybody.

B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|There is a consistency of powerful motifs and a return to the intense melodic excellence that made us all love Helloween in the first place. Excellent overall.
1881273156|3.0|Like the book.... just a little to worn and writen in !<br /><br />THe book is great . I just wont purchased used again.
B00683JK9K|3.0|The puzzle pictures are nice and there is a number of features to spice up the game from beginner (all pieces properly oriented) to advanced. There are also filters to show only corner pieces that are helpful.<br />Played this on my S3, the interface is slow, picking up the pieces to move them on the board is really painful. If you have to tap to turn them, it works only 50% of the time. It is really frustrating to use.<br />Got the app free on a deal of the day but I wouldn't pay for it.
B00867GHS8|5.0|it came on time and at a great price!  I am going to enjoy this movie with my family. thanks
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The books were okay....this is the best of the series. More plot and less of the graphic stuff was better for me.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was a waste of time!  The ending was horrible.  I honestly don't know what the hype was all about.

B00873GRU4|3.0|This Novel or collection of stories starts of well but then gets boring with a lot of pointless running around trying to achieve impossible tasks that you know the heroes will somehow miraculously pull off.  I got bored about 2/3 of the way in but up until then it was well written.  I managed to get it finished but it was a struggle
B00004RF9B|5.0|Fantastic 1950s Sci-Fi, My 1st taste of the genre.A must have for any Sci-Fi collector ( The crew uniforms where used in several other movies and tv shows as well)

I know Matrix, and Unknown is no Matrix!<br /><br />the common theme is that it takes something or SOMEONE from the OUTSIDE to shed LIGHT on the TRUE reality!!  Just hope it is not a FALSE LIGHT...because if you say it is LIGHT...indeed how DARK IT MUST BE!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Amazing the hubby and I use this to go to sleep every night! Love being able to customize our sounds!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this because the price seemed right for my first photo backpack. The construction is pretty good and it doesn't say &#34;steal me&#34; like other ones do with their big logos on it. it holds my Canon T3i  SLR, 3 lenses(2 telephoto, 1 zoom), Flash and still has a little room left over in the main compartment. The flap section holds all kind of things as well. It has four zippered compartments with 2 clear bags on the inside for quick views of your equipment or supplies.The side straps hold my Dolica 62inch metal tripod nice and snug. No worries about it slipping off at all. It sits pretty good on your back for anyone 6ft. and up. This backpack does ride a little high on your back and it doesn't reach your tailbone like other bags out there. This is a good thing if you plan to do some hiking or traveling around the world. Its also seems to be weatherproof. If your in search of a good bag with a lot of room to work with, comfortable to wear and constructed well then look no further
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I was completely captivated by the film! Having just turned 60 yrs old, and having been a Musician for 45 yrs, I felt like it was telling my story and expressing my sadness with the state of, not only the Music Industry itself, but in the loss of the &#34;Creative Process&#34; Itself!!!<br />I've always (personnally) preferred &#34;Live&#34; performances to &#34;Recorded Music&#34; because of that &#34;capture of the music in that moment&#34;, the uniqueness, and the spontanious nature of the Songs.

B00683JK9K|5.0|I love this puzzle app. The pictures are beautiful. you Don't have to set up a table and worry about losing pieces or having the kids or pets jump in the middle...You can set the difficulty, work the edges, then work to completion. No fuss, no mess...just enjoy ~^··^~
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice game n one of my favorite game ever nice feature cool character love these game good power ups and awesome challengers
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|cant use it on my kindle, so its useless.  would not recommend it.  Maybe it works on other devices but not the kindle fire.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|this is probably my favorite twitter app. I've tried using others like tweetcaster and it just wasn't nearly as good! I'd like it if you could switch it to a desktop view, but I still love it.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|As much as I love \\"Downton Abbey,\\" I was shocked when I discovered that the PBS broadcast version contains material that is not on the UK-edition DVD. PBS is doing their viewers a distinct disservice by only selling the UK version on disc and not warning purchasers that it does not contain all the scenes that it is showing on television. The differences appear to be brief and minor, but they are still important and they cast various characters and situations in a new light.<br /><br />It is unclear if PBS will ever release the US version of the show on disc but they should be providing accurate information to purchasers on just what it is we're paying for. I have read that there is allegedly a Christmas special in season 3, but if so it is not included in this set and PBS has not indicated whether it will be broadcast.<br /><br />As a devoted fan, I want to know that I can get ALL of \\"DA\\" on DVD. Come on, PBS--come clean! I would give the series itself 5 stars, of course, but the DVD release only gets three because of the misrepresentation and the missing scenes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME SO DO MY LITTLE BROTHER BUT IT DOES TAKE A WHILE TO LOAD:( OTHE THAN THAT GREAT GAME!!!!

B008F9E306|1.0|this is not in any way suitable for anyone. except a crackhead gangster from the ghetto. this is nothing but absolute trash!
B006WQLH7G|1.0|I have choose this rating because I hae not been able to get it load to my Kindle Fire and Kindle HD.  I have tried numerous times.  I am not sure what the problem is. I have it on my laptop and love it.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|You do have to pay five dollars to unlock the game, but it is high quality, and a lot of work obviously went into making it, so the price is fair in my opinion.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great book, couldn't put it down!  I didn't find anything lacking as the author did a great job of painting the characters from their early life all the way up til their reunion and final deaths.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am learning so much about this great country and incredible man!  Goodwin writes so eloquently, and her research is incredibly comprehensive.

B009D5VNLS|3.0|I wasn't that impressed with this one.  I mean really do we need another movie encouraging disrespectful behaviour and attitudes toward parents for any reason.....no.
0783231202|5.0|This was a very moving and graphic movie but an important insight into the history of slavery. Well worth watching.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|Excellent dialogue, music superb. Altman and Fellows knew what they were doing.  Great period piece with. Characters that make the story exciting.  All in all a great film.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was excited when I received this book for Christmas. I dove right into it shortly after I finished the current book I was reading. I enjoyed the beginning of the book and how the chapters were divided between the spouses.  However, I did not enjoy the book through and through. I found that the characters really had no redeeming qualities. They seemed to lack purpose in their lives except for making each other feel pain. They definitely had some personality disorders. Anyway, although it was a decent read, I was disappointed with the book in the end. :-( sigh..
B003O86FMW|5.0|More intriguing and enthralling than the first book. Cannot wait to read the third. Ordering it as we speak. Such a good series.
0062515675|5.0|I love this book, and I'm a voracious reader.  I've read all of Gladwell's books, and don't see why reviewers here would even compare the two author's works. Blink is one of my favorite books. Completely different from Sharma's parable. Quick read.  This is a forced spiritual awakening.  It will resonate with anyone caught in the rat race.  Anyone who is surrounded by material wealth who does not truly feel rich, and doesn't know why. I highly recommend it. -Maria Dorfner [[ASIN:0007179731 Monk Who Sold His Ferrari]]
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is lightweight as well as sturdy and durable. I'm able to use it in different positions. It also protects my kindle all the way around it. Def worth the price. Glad I didn't over pay for it. I received it in less amount of time as it was expected.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book, I took a class in Jane Austen and I will read this over and over again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this Temple Run! It is more challenging then the original ever was. Actually the other day, after having played the this version for awhile, I reverted back to &#34;Temple Run&#34; and was so disappointed and found myself asking, &#34;what did I ever see in this game? It's soooo inferior.&#34;  So, get this game. It's free and amazing.
0345525558|1.0|I had high hopes for this book but it was a complete boring let down. I did not like the main character Victoria at all. She is awful! I could care less about her. She meets loving nice people and she repels them. I could not wait for the book to finally end. It seemed endless! The only redeemable part was learning about the meaning behind flowers.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This book was absolutely adorable!! It makes me want to go to Paris even more than I already do and find an Etienne St. Clair of my own! He is beyond cute and I found myself falling in love with him right along with Anna! I definitely recommend this book to anyone. It was really so adorable and I couldn't help but smile constantly throughout Anna's parisian adventure. Read this book, it will not disappoint :)

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm an owner of Sennheiser's HD598 and I gotta say, that Sony MDR7506 is an awesome product. It's a legacy one, but the sound is pristine, really balanced. Awesome highs and really well defined lows.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I grew up with Nintendo Family Computer in '80. I have been playing all series of FF and DQ.  Now, I have Play Station3 to play RPG and I wasn't sure if I want to buy this by spending ~$15 for Kindle Game and I've already played FFIII a long time ago with TV RPG.  But I gave it a try....  I played 10-15 hours so far and I strongly think it's worth to pay if you like RPG or you'd like to try it out at the first time.  I use Stylus on Kindle Display and I have a bit of tough time to control direction where I want to move game character on Kindle Display, but, I hope I'm getting to use to do it eventually.  3D Polygon to represent game characters are somewhat rough compared to the latest  and greatest very pricey game, but, it doesn't bother me so mcuh. My Kindle Fire has smaller display. If I had Kindle Fire HD and plug it into large LCD panel TV, then, this may be obvious visually.  Anyway, I enjoy playing old pure RPG lately!

B007PTJOV0|5.0|great app.  for kids and for me too!  it so totally reminds me when I was a youngster :)  so love it? &lt;3
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game is so much more than every other game it's has blocks and tools and monsters it is so much fun get this game
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Well written. It isn't overly scary, doesn't drag out. It is a great mystery book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Any movie of Dr. Suess is a must own. This one i say more than others because it shows great faith in the worl dwe have where everyone can come together and make something great! Kids must see
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|This game has the dynamic of being a simple yet challenging game. I really came to like this game, but the controls can be a little bit confusing. Apart from that its a fantastic game. The graphics are pretty amazing, and I can see a lot of people losing hours on this app if it's your  kind of game.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Disney is great! and although this is a cartoon like most disney it has its scary parts. But shows the tru meaning of friendship and good charcter
B0088P2A7A|1.0|The app doesn't work most of the time. I'm going to remove it. I think Wikipedia could do better quite frankly.
B00447L4JG|5.0|This movie is the best movie made! its a great story line and plot and the product i recieved was incredibly
B000LB7G00|5.0|I am an amateur at SolidWorks, but I found myself on a research project at my university that required a great deal of SW in a manner of weeks. After a week of trying to make due with just my trackball, I decided I need a 3d mouse to speed up my work. After a lot of research, I decided to purchase this starter model to see how much I would like it.<br /><br />This turned out great, and I was able to create a fully assembled rehabilitation robot within month that has garnered much praise. I attribute a lot of my speed to be able to independently move around and click at the same time.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who is about to start a lot of CAD work.
0545265355|5.0|came in sealed and not damaged. Love the quality and the fact that they came in the box it was a great present for my cousin she loved it
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The book was okay. I did not think that it lived up to the hype that eveyone put on it.
B00000IZOR|5.0|Grand kids today don't know about rotor-types phones anymore.  So, it's fun to watch them play with this toy one.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|friend suggested this an I love it.<br />good for passing time<br />have played other versions before like this one best
B003O86FMW|5.0|The sequel surpasses the original!  Can't wait to read the next book. You really feel connected to the characters and are invested in their story. Couldn't put this book down.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I felt so sorry for Jack even though he was happy. Being unaware of what he was missing he was just happy to live the only life he knew with his mother, who tried to make an unbearable situation tolerable, even joyful at times, for her son.
B006S009IY|5.0|I loved the storyline..Love Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet..Sad, funny, very enjoyable too watch, could watch again again and again
B009VB7P6G|3.0|My daughter enjoyed the movie.  She has seen most of the Disney producedTinkerbell movies.  The movie kept her attention until it was over.  If the movie can hold her attention for 90 mins, I take that as a good sign.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Extreme level of detail, well suited for someone in the financial services industry, yet witty and well written enough for everyone to learn something.
B009738XXM|4.0|My daughters is entering the stage where she likes to listen to music.  I have listened to several of Carly's songs on the tv and radio.  My daughter likes to listen to the songs and coreograph little dance numbers to them.  Thankfully, Carly's songs are enjoyable enough that I can stand to listen to them also.
B006MPKDD6|5.0|Always a pleasure to read Connelly and particularly with Harry Bosch and all his foibles.  This story ran well, had excellent characters and wonderful plot, twists and turns everywhere.  Very enjoyable.
B005HSL626|4.0|My seven year old daughter enjoys playing this game on my Kindle Fire.  I don't understand the value or purpose of chopping up fruit and vegetables.  But, it keeps her occupied at home and while driving long distances.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is better than most games.I like this game because it is fun.I can play it while I'm bored
B00571F26Y|5.0|Decided to read this book because of having family members with celiac and also several members with lactose problems and a couple with auto immune conditions.  We have seen results of signifient weight loss and improved overall health when wheat was signifiently reduced in relitives.  After reading this book & looking at a  number of references from it, we are starting a wheat free diet.  Our goal is to give it a 90 day trial.  Since we've only started, I plan on updating this review in 3 months.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season yet... Loved the prison scene stuff... Cant wait foe it to continue already come on guys Do it
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It was very refreshing to read a book from the guy's point of view.  Also the book was very well written and I very much enjoyed it.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I have loved each of Mitch Albom's previous books so couldn't wait to dive into his newest book. The Time Keeper's concept is about how the notion of 'time' began, how it affects our lives and what happens when we try to meddle with fate. The fable begins with Dor aka Father Time, the inventor of 'time' who is banished to a cave and listens to everyone's plea for more time. The concept so intrigued me. Turned out that for me, it was just an okay book but not one of the author's best. It has plenty of thought provoking moments but I found it a little dull and not as engaging as I had hoped. That being said, it has inspired me to think more about how I spend and measure my time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a decent game and pretty cute with good graphics. i like the competition set up. idont like having a minimum word req to submit this
B006PFC2S2|5.0|An all-time classic!!! I remember seeing this movie as a child, and it is still as wonderful as it was back then. A good family musical film.
B007R41E8O|1.0|it wouldn't let me download game and I paid for it. it kept installing over and over. I got tired of it and deleted it.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Always a fan of labs myself, this movie almost makes me want to go jrt!  Made me cry and it's not even a sad movie!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was great and I can't wait for the next one. I would recommend it to any of my friends.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|This was quite a good book.  It is my style of book and I wanted to keep reading to the end.
B002R88G5E|5.0|eyeopening it takes you from your world to theirs. It makes you think about how lucky we are. It very sad. Ienjoyed it and couldn't put it down at times
B004TP0M0K|4.0|Oliver Stone, someone that everyone would like to know, your best mate but also a protector. This is a good read and has a lot of suspense.  Typical government conspiracy,  But I did like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose five stars for this book because the book was so good u don't want to put it down. You read one thing then Collins surprises u with something else to get excited about. I liked the suspense and romance with Katniss and Peeta. I would recommend this book to everyone who is mature enough to know this doesn't really happen in real life.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I read this because all my friends were and raving about it. Gave it a go and I really enjoyed it. Not sure that I would enjoy any others of the same genre but this was good.  The writing was pretty poor and there will be no awards for the way the writing goes, but it really is an easy read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|It is not a real fast paced game and. That is why I love it I could sit for hours and if you don't make the level you can go back and try again.
B004S49YVU|4.0|If you like Oliver Stone, this one shows you where the characters come from, how some of them came to be part of the Camel Club and why they are so close.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Endlessly entertaining and great puzzlers.  Made my Kindle Fire HD something other than a gizmo to read books.  Highly recommended.
B004S5FVJS|4.0|I really like these books and find that you don't really need to read them in order to be able to understand what is happening.  If you like Oliver Stone you will like this one.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I was never a huge fan of Slash (or GnR for that matter - pretty good, but not great). I always thought Slash was overrated and more of an image thing. I've heard him outside of GnR on a few one-off projects (Hendrix tribute and Muddy Waters tribute), and the solos sounded the same and stale.<br />But I heard \\"Standing In The Sun\\" on the radio, and I liked it enough to try this CD. Holy crap is it good. \\"Standing In The Sun\\" is the weakest cut on the CD.<br />I'm also a Myles Kennedy fan. His vocals are perfectly suited for this heavy rock, but unlike Alter Bridge, these songs are not all power ballads. Now, I like power ballads and Alter Bridge, but they get old. Same formula, etc. But these songs are just straight-forward heavy rock. Powerful, riff-heavy, and show-off chops. Each different and great. I am officially a Slash fan now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game! I haven't been this addicted since doodle jump! It's reminds me of temple run so much. I love jumping the trains
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I bought the book for kindle based on the reviews, and while the story is somewhat interesting, I found most of the writing irritating - characters thoughts either flogging a subject to death, or reiterating what has already seemed obvious from the characters actions.  There were also spelling mistakes, yes fowl (birds) is not spelled foul.  Generally, the book could have improved with another layer of editing.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I didn't realize what it was and didn't need it so I say I wouldn't hate it just no need for it
B009UX2YAC|3.0|this game is awsome i would buy this anytime of the day and updayes are awsome best game ever its like a boss :p
B006WQLH7G|5.0|its automatic on line & great I've used it for years - when I still had dial up!!! i recomend it
B007JWKLMO|4.0|Excellent DVD for the George fan.  Little bit long if you are looking for Beatle-centric stuff.  Great deal of after-the-fab four material.  Obviously Scorsese is a fan too.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|&#34;The Life of Pi&#34; is a brilliantly written book, full of images and human feelings that all ring true.  It was difficult to put my kindle down before I had finished reading.  The second half held an interesting twise and it left the reader with plenty of things to continue thinking about:  it is a book that lives on after the last word is read.
B008602KQI|1.0|This purchase was made much to easy for anyone with simple access to a computer.  Unfortunately, my 5 year old granddaughter pressed one to many keys, and so I am stuck with a purchase that never will be seen.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Exciting, interesting, intriguing aresomeof the adjectives Iwould use to describe Dexter Season five.  Frequently I stayed up way too late watching it because i simply could not stop.
0385344228|2.0|I am a fan of William Landay's \\"Mission Flats\\" so I was really happy to get a chance to read this one.  And I am a fan of courtroom thrillers, so it looked like a can't miss opportunity.  But I am terribly disappointed.  I don't think that I have ever read any other novel where I did not like any of the characters.  It is hard to enjoy a book when you don't identify with anyone.  In a novel of suspense, you need someone to root for.  None of the characters ever rang true to me; they seemed to act out of character.  And to the extent that they were consistent in their character, they were simply unlikeable.  I kept reading because the plot was intriguing; I wanted to see how the author got out of painting himself into a corner.  The question of what lengths you would go to protect your own child was interesting.  But the characters are total strangers to me; they are made of some unnatural, unfriendly and abrasive wood.  Reading this book was like spending way too much time at a party with people with really, really bad breath.  You can't wait to get out of there.  But you will stick it out because you like the garlic.  My advice is to stick with Scott Turow.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an enchanting coming-of-age novel. It was so real for me. My niece has been battling leukemia for 2 years and the sometimes uncomfortable reality of this story and its characters was compelling. I laughed, cried and pondered the fragility of this life we lead. I think almost anyone would find this an insightful read.
B007X15GRQ|5.0|This is a great &#34;guy flick&#34;.  Lots of action, not a terribly complex plot line and everybody gets what they deserve in the end.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I finished this book because I finish books, but I found this subject and these characters reprehensible. I am sure the writing was technically well done, but the overall feeling I had when finished was not one of \\"improving my mind' or one of enjoyment. Read it if the baser human characteristics appeal to you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you saw the movie, and either thought it was great, or hated it, you owe it to your self to read this book.  There are rich characters that were never even introduced in the movie and several subtle twists that didn't make it to the movie adaptation.
B007HO392S|5.0|Purchased this as a Christmas Gift for my mother-in-law.  She was very happy to get this since she is a big Carrie fan!  It played great!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The entire hunger games series is perceived as a teenage series.  It definitely is not.  Under the plot are very complex issues facing societies today.  On top of that is a fun plot line with really good good guys and really bad bad guys.
B007C94QRK|5.0|Very cute and funny movie,good for people of all<br />ages,very non-offensive. I recommend it to everyone.<br />The songs sang on the film make the film even more<br />delightful.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|Gina Carano does a great job on screen in making a high violence bang bang shoot'em up.  The plot isn't fantiastic, but that isn't what this type of flick is about.  Think of this as a Arnold movie with a female hero.
B004C03L4G|5.0|I got a sample of this book and read through it in one night, i loved all the messages so much i bought it and now read one every morning as it is meant to be read. Sometimes the messages i get really relate to something I am currantly experiencing and I am just in awe because I really needed to hear that message at this time. Other days are just inspirational messages, all are wonderful and help create a sense of purpose and calm to start my day.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Each of the Hunger Games is a good read into itself, but the series is great.  Mockingjay wraps up the trilogy quite nicely, and offers readers something to think about in their own society.  Fun action, the writer definitely thought &#34;outside the box&#34; about some of the technology, and the characters stayed true to form.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|WOW!! This is a book that I am recommending to everyone! I couldn't read this book fast enough yet never wanted it to end. There are lots of characters and flashbacks and a dysfunctional family. I thought I had it figured out, to find out I was way off, only in the end, to realize I did have it right after all, but felt differently about the characters when more back story was revealed. Storytelling at its finest!
B004FRB3OQ|5.0|i have a sony ex3 and SXS are very expansive, i work 4 months with SD class 10 and it works perfectly, never i lost any recording or never fail.... gr8 product
0385341008|5.0|I didn't think I would be interested in a post WWII novel, but I loved this book from the first page!! I loved that it was written in letter style. The characters and their stories were real to me. They were quirky and witty and amazing. Their stories made me laugh and cry. I wanted it to keep going and going so I took my time finishing it so I could savor the ending. This is a book I will definitely read again and again!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I so love Toy Story!  Buzz Lightyear is awesome as is Woody.  The actors who are the &#34;voices&#34; of these characters are excellent.  I would so recommend buying this book for yourself, your children, your grandchildren, anyone you love!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book continues Martins style of developing each major character's experiences in separate chapters, which seems perfect for recounting events that are happening at multiple different locales at the same time.  Hard for me to imagine how any SciFi/Fantasy fan wouldn't enjoy this series (well, except maybe for those few who restrict themselves to &#34;hard science SciFi&#34;), but for the rest of us this is a blast!  I'm an MD & scientist who has been reading SciFi (in the braodest sense of the genre) for over 50 years...the writing is superb, the story intiguing - what's not to like?
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I love Toy Story 2!  This is a fun-loving movie that you can sit down and enjoy and get lost in the story.  That is a good movie!
038533348X|5.0|this book is helping me to read and to complete all my assignments in english lit class there is no dislikes or cons about this product at all thanks for a great experience.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The horses move well. This is pretty intuitive, and includes most of the things you would see in an English show barn, especially the prices to upgrade equipment. I think it's a great way to fill time.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It's a good way to pass the time, but it would be nice if there were some new options for accessories, outfits, jetpacks, and missions. I've beaten the game a few times and would love to continue playing, but it gets a bit old with nothing new to spend coins on or any new missions.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I am still reading this book but I like it very much.  Even though it is fiction it is very easy to get into the story as though it is real a real current event.  The characters are easy to remember and keep organized while reading without using notes referencing who is who and where do they fit in the story line.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game. Same character's and powerups but way better graphics. I love the zipline and spinning wheel of death. So far not glitchy like the last one. The price (free!) is great and I love the sound effects.  I hope there is a 3rd temple run or an update in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app for comparing Bible versions quickly. The navigation is a little difficult at first but very simple once you understand it. I would recommend it to all.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|Some people act as if puking is a sign of Satan. Really? If that is the big deal for the devil then I guess millions of people are possessed after they have been out drinking too much, or eating bad seafood. Come on! Don't disrespect this unique and well made movie because the little girl didn't puke green pea soup or get busy with the Crucifix. That is SO 1973!  This story was well written and the filmography was excellent. It had some intense scenes but nothing to make you turn away from the screen. I thought some of the graphics pertaining to the demon were quite disturbing without being plain disgusting. I gave it the full five stars because it -on its own merit- was an excellent movie. Yes, I agree that if we compare it to some of the more grisly offerings from 1973 forward it is not as SHOCKING --but not every movie is written for SHOCK VALUE. This was first and foremost a love story. I will leave it at that because I do not want to drop any spoilers. Listen, if you are looking for a lot of puke and demons speaking through kids to tell the parent that she wears army boots, this probably is not your best choice. If you want repulsive blood and guts, rent or purchase Descent and Descent II. Those are freaky, disgusting but very good movies. This one, I contend is very good, and quite freaky --just not disgusting. I would be willing to bet that you will not look down your throat in the mirror the same ever again. And every time you cough, you will think of this movie. Oh yeah. It's subtle, but effective.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|Thought the movie was pretty slow to get started but wound up pretty good.  The story had a pretty dated feel but the source material was written awhile back and it stuck pretty close to the comics but I would have preferred something not so 80s feeling.
B004SDEP38|4.0|The overall suite is quite good, and has a fair amount of capabilities for a mobile office suite. Its ability to print to google cloud print is quite useful, but takes a bit of work to setup. Overall, i would say its onw of the best on tje market.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A quick fun read that never lets up on the action. I really could not put the book down and kept reading it any chance I got.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Really enjoyed this period piece -- a real glimpse into the lives of the British landed gentry.  Bought the first two episodes from Amazon, watching the rest of Season 3 on PBS.  Note:  The original broadcast's Episode 1 is a two-hour segment; Amazon sells this as Episode 1 and 2.  So Amazon's Episode 3 is the same as broadcast Episode 2, and so on.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a friend who just knew it was no longer in print.... surprised her and I was very pleased with not only the fact it was on Kindle but it was the exact book she remembers as a child.. thanks ...
B005FMZVLQ|1.0|With a few month of use the strap got deteriorated. That's because the bad quality of the strap, it's a terrible strap!
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I love classic film and this is one of my favorites.  Partly due to the fact that I love Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal together; it's no wonder these two had a long affair - they had a natural chemistry.  I also have a new respect for the film after listening to an audio book of Atlas Shrugged - I now have a better understanding of the tumultuous attitude of the characters.<br /><br />And, one of the most profound statements ever written:  \\"Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision.\\"  I'll delve into the book in the near future for the complete story.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|love this game and the graphics are good on my kindle fire. Just wish the demo was longer. definately recommend
0812550706|4.0|Not a big science fiction fan, but this book was chosen by our book club.  I really enjoyed it--well written, not so far out there you couldn't comprehend what was going on, but definitely sy phy.  The characters were believable and tied you into the story.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|The second season has what has always been my favorite episode, The bath item gift hypothesis. Seriously, best show on TV. Thanks Chuck & Bill for making science awesome!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What's not to love?  If you follow the series, you get a chance to go back and review it.  Or if you miss a season you can catch up quickly!
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|great DVD set. I love the show, and the DVD comment extras were great. That cast is naturally just so funny!
0345495004|5.0|Although this story is fiction, it is based on truth.  This book tells the story of Frank Lloyd Wright's relationship with his wife and family and his clandestine love affair.  Insights into this famous man, interesting.
B009GX69RK|5.0|this show is funny, appealing to me a single girl in her 20's. I imaging most women this age would enjoy it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Challenging with the perfect amount of mindlessness!! Could not be more fun to play to pass a little time. :)
B005P4P966|5.0|This is the best show on TV. While I dislike that is has dropped some of the science for &#34;relationships&#34; in order to become the  new FREINDS, it still keeps enough around to be nerd-funny!
B00683JK9K|3.0|Even at the advanced levels, these puzzles are a little too easy.  The pieces want to find their proper place as soon as you get anywhere close to the spot.  Still, it is a relaxing distraction for a few minutes.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|Was a gift for my husband.  Ordered a &#34;used DVD&#34;  It was obviously a &#34;copy&#34; and not a very good one.  Next time will spend the few extra dollars for a &#34;New&#34; DVD.  Also with a new  dvd ,should get a much better quality picture and extra production features. Will know better the next time .
0425252868|5.0|One of the most realistic stories of aerial combat combined with the integrated stories of two lives ever written. One of only a few stories that should be studied.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I paid for the full version and played one time this morning. Now it won't open. It just closes on itself. :(
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I love the dvd set.  I have the other seasons and i love them all great purchase. Its great for the whole family to watch
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I give all episodes of Downton Abbey a thumbs up!! A rating of 5. Love this series. Just wish there were more episodes per season. Hope there are many more seasons to come!
B003YL4KS0|4.0|The book was awesome, but my complaint is that there should be videos that go along with it at various points. I am reading on my Kindle Fire, and when I get to the part where the video should be , it says that the video is not supported by the device.  This doesn't make sense, because my kindle fire plays video... I just don't understand what the problem is. Its kind of frustrating. This is the only reason I rated it 4 instead of 5.  I still recommend the book, its great!
B005URRCUY|4.0|This was a new group for me and I really liked it, will consider getting another CD some time in the future.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|An amazing adventure in a world I love to live in! Love the characters and all their adventures everyday more and more!
0718157834|5.0|I do love the book, sad but great. I wanted a different ending, but knew it wouldn't happen.<br /><br />Me Before You.  great book
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|\\"What if someone really good made a horror picture.\\" After the success of North By Northwest Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins) was looking for his next film to direct. After reading a book he finds what he is looking for. The studio is against it but Hitchcock decided to finance the movie himself, breaking all the rules as he goes. The story is real, the horror is real, this is the story of the making of Psycho. I'm not sure why but I am a big fan of movies about movies. I was very interested in seeing this not only for that but also because I am a big Anthony Hopkins fan and thought he would be a good choice for this role. The movie itself is really good with some pretty creepy aspects to it but the job that Hopkins does is pretty amazing and sometimes you actually see Hitchcock himself. I'm not sure how accurate this is but Hopkins played a man on the edge of sanity and knowing what I know about Hitchcock it seems to fit. If you are looking for a complete bio-pic of Hitchcock this is not it, but if you are a fan of his then this is a movie not to be missed. I recommend this. Overall, the movie is good but Hopkins is great. I give it a B+.

B005WUHAX8|4.0|This phone case is really cute and great for a clumsy girl like me, it's only downfall is that you have to use an adapter cord to plug in your headphones (a bit of a hassle)....but other than that, I absolutely love it!!
0345803493|1.0|......than read another tortured word in this book.  In fact, I'd rather slather my body with the excrement of 1000 Bulgarian white hogs and be slowly gnawed to death by a toothless, schizophrenic rat than read another \\"work of art\\" by Ms. James.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this game and cant find any flaws i seriously reccomend this game and its free!!! GET THIS GAME!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thrilling and good couldn't put it Down can't wait to read the third book to see what happens where it takes ud
