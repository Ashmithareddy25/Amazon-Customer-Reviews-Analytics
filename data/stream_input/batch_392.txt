B00005JMJ4|5.0|People exited the theaters en masse when they went to see Jack Lemmon in &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; because it wasn't the sort of film he'd made before. More serious, not slapstick with broad humor. I think the same thing applies to &quot;Lost In Translation.&quot; People go in thinking it's going to be another &quot;What About Bob&quot; or &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, and while both are great comedies, they're nothing like this film. It's peaceful and poetic, to make you think, not just eke guffaws from the audience. So keep that in mind if you choose to buy this.
B00000IQMT|3.0|I managed to buy and listen to the soundtrack before I saw the movie. If anything, I thought this might give me an idea of the flavor of the film. Alas, my prediction proved to be correct. Aside from \\"Duel of the Fates,\\" which is the kick-butt music heard during the lightsaber duel, the soundtrack was very subdued. Slow. I really expected a lot of high-speed action music, with violins flying up and down the scale or rapid drumbeats. Alas, I heard a lot of slow, sonorous drum beating and long, drawn-out, sentimental violin pieces.<br />There was also a plot moment that is given away in the soundtrack if (like me) you happen to buy the CD before seeing the movie: the death of Qui-Gon. I sort of expected it, anyway, because we all know that Obi-wan Kenobi was Anakin's trainer, not Qui-Gon. Sorry if I blew a story moment for some people. That's just something I noticed.<br />When I saw the movie (read my review for my \\"take\\" on that), I was only slightly surprised that the film was a drag. This soundtrack was too tame and too soft for a Star Wars soundtrack, and Phantom Menace is too slow to be a Star Wars film. I'm listening to the CD as I write this, to make sure I'm giving the soundtrack a fair shake. Track 12 is pretty nimble, but also slows down rather quickly. There were no pieces here that were particularly memorable, except for \\"Duel of the Fates,\\" nothing to stick in the skull like \\"Darth Vader's Theme\\" or the music heard during the chase through the asteroids in Empire Strikes Back.<br />The only other bit of color in the soundtrack was \\"Augie's Great Municipal Band,\\" which mixes calypso police whistles with a digeree-doo (sp?) and children's voices singing glossolalia in the background. Intriguing, and typical of Williams' great efforts at conjuring up interesting \\"alien\\" music using unusual instruments.<br />And when you get right down to it, I still missed hearing the Star Wars key signature, which only appears only once, during track 11, around 2:33.
0792844939|5.0|To be an artist, to be successful, one has to be crazy, corrugated, out of space, and a few other things that are absolutely obviously insane. Normality is the direct and constant enemy of real creativity. The point is then that one artist cannot live with another artist because they neutralize each other and then become either unbearably boring, or unbearably dangerous for themselves or each other, or unbearably lethal for everyone else around them. Scorsese uses this basic sentimental or passionate situation not to explore the complexity of human relations, mis-relations and all kinds of subtleties from open hatred to absolute submission. He uses this sentimental situation to show how powerful New York is in its own creative drive, creative inspiration, in its own driving force for creative minds. The two artists manage to separate when they are closest in the very birth of their common child, son. And each one of them finds the energy they need to reach the highest level of creativity they can imagine. The best part in the irony of the whole story is that both will become top artists in their different genres with the same song, composed by him and whose lyrics were written by her. They find their full power separately and yet in a piece of artwork that is pure collaboration. One will make it a formidable piece of jazzy music and the other will make it a formidable song and both will sing or play or evoke the power of New York in their minds, in the mind of the world in the whole consciousness of the whole world. And they will meet again to pay tribute to each other and go on with life on their separate diverging roads, because New York is not the centre of the world, it is only the crossroads of all the roads in the world. All roads do not lead to New York as they used to lead to Rome as if they all used to end in Rome, but all roads in the world go through New York at one time or other in life. Very sad though because it also means all roads go away from New York and can never come back.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesrk and can never come back.

B000001G89|5.0|I stopped listening to &quot;Carmen&quot; years and years ago because I was, quite frankly, totally sick of it.  Owning the famous recordings by Rise Stevens, Solange Michel, Leontyne Price, Maria Callas, Titiana Troyanos, etc, I gave most of them away, keeping only the wonderful de los Angeles EMI version (now available on EMI's Great Recordings of the Century).  I was perfectly content to live with this single recording.  I mean - after forty years of opera going and record buying, what could &quot;Carmen&quot; ever do for ME?  Nothing, I thought, and I just left it alone.<BR>     I received this recording of &quot;Carmen&quot; for my birthday, and  reluctantly, I opened it and put it on.  I was immediately stunned by Abado's tempi and the sheer sound of the orchestra.  The French dialogue was crisp and peppy, and the choral work was stunning.  Placido Domingo's Don Jose was known to me, as I heard him do the role with Lyric Opera of Chicago years ago, but I didn't remember him sounding quite this wonderful.  His Flower Song would melt a stone, and his singing throughout is sympathetic and very moving.  Sherrill Milnes does not really have a very big role here -- he sings his Torreador Song well, and sings with sufficient ardor to arouse Carmen, which is basically what he's there for.  Micaela is sensitively sung by Cotrubas, and she blends beautifully with Domingo in their first act duet ---- also, she sounds genuinely terrified in her third act aria.  <BR>     Now to the sublime Teresa Berganza.  Quite plainly, I have never heard the role of Carmen sung so beautifully.  The sheer sound of Berganza's magnificent voice is truly something to experience.  It cannot be described.  She is a patrician Carmen ----eschewing all of the traditional gypsy spitfire teeth gnashing -- and creating a beautiful portrait of a free spirit whose voice is as beautiful as she is.  No Carmen I have ever heard --- the great Victoria de los Angeles included -- has ever sounded like this.  Berganza is a great artist, and not even her beautiful work in Rossini and Mozart prepared me for the sheer beauty of her Carmen.  Aided and supported by Abbado, who shapes the score in a completely new way, Berganza has made me completely re-evaluate this opera ---- and that is no small feat.<BR>     This is a recording to own, cherish, and play --- over and over again.   It's a jewel of a recording.
B00013EY7Q|4.0|This film is surprising, surprisingly slow, surprisingly uneventful. Nothing happens, or rather no action whatsoever happens in the whole film. Don't be a middle-aged or advanced middle-aged man staying in Japan for a few professional days. This will lead to some boring experience. The poor man is taken care of by his boss and is provided with some female entertainment who titillates him and tries to make him rape her : phantasms are the target and tool of the « professional » woman. But then that poor man enables us to review the fate of this type of men : they are travelling for their professions, they are away from their families most of the time, they are the distant husbands - which satisfies the wife who retreated into motherhood -, they frustrate their children and develop with them a relation based on absence and estrangement, etc. They happen here and there to let themselves get involved in the hunt of some women (the women are the hunters), in this case an American singer in the hotel. They are also moved by some younger women who are also estranged from their husbands who are around but working on location as photographers or anything else. And that's the main interest of the film. The age gap is so important that there will be no passionate sexual exploration, but rather a highly sophisticated even cultured exploration of emotions and nothing but emotions. Ms Coppola goes against the grain that considers that these older men are predators and that these younger women are willing explorers of the human jungle. The passion, if indeed it is a passion, that develops here is purely platonic and shows that the man, as well as the woman, are looking for companionship and soul or spiritual exchange. The depth of this relation is shown in the accidental final goodbye scene. The man is playing father more than lover to the woman, and incest, remember, is rejected by all sane men and women. Temptation maybe, but a fruit that will never be plucked. This vision is definitely feminine and it shows that the younger woman might be led into yielding, maybe. She might not resist if the man were insistant. But Ms Coppola imagines a man who is not insistant and projects her desire or her knowledge, who knows which, to meet such older men, father figures that would not be insistant and try to become lovers. A fine film both about the real world and about the world Ms Coppola would like to meet. A crisscrossing patchwork of reality and dream, and you will never find out where each one starts and each one ends.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUdefinitely feminine and it shows that the younger woman might be led into yielding, maybe.

0066620996|1.0|Imagine 1,024 people participating in a coin-flipping exercise.    Those who flip heads \\"win,\\" those who flip tails are eliminated.      Now let's assume that the coin-flipping adheres to the norm--that is, a flip yields heads half the time, and tails half the time.  And let's do the flip-and-elimination exercise 10 times.    At the end, out of 1024 competitors, you should have one winner who's flipped 10 consecutive heads.    Is the winner great at flipping heads?  No.  Is the winner lucky?  No.  Is the winner inevitable?  YES.    And that's the problem with Jim Collins' dunderheaded exercise--he's wowed by the winning coin flipper's success.  He can't wait to interview the flipping champion, pore over the data to recreate the sheer drama/moments of truth surrounding each individual flip, find the subtle nuances beneath the flipper's consistent performance, and draw universally applicable lessons from the coin flipper's astounding success.  I mean, how can anyone argue with TEN CONSECUTIVE flips of heads, right?    Um, actually everyone should argue with it, Jimmy.    Just like Tom Peters did fifteen years before with In Search of Excellence, Collins sanctifies his business winners, completely overlooking the fact that 1) plenty of business losers followed IDENTICAL strategies and still lost and 2) if you have any criteria for excellence that generates more than zero companies pulled from a universe of more than zero companies, then one or more companies MUST, by definition, make the cut, which leads us to 3) so what?--without a statistically rigorous analysis, there's a fairly serious possibility that a number of companies are making the cut randomly.  Collins really stumbles on this last one--without statistical proof, not only can't he distinguish between Good and Great, he can't even make the call between Good and Kind of Random, Dude.    Like Collins' masquerade, Peters' book was a big hit, but followers of Peters soon ran into the Law of George Bernard Shaw--Time Wounds All Heels; most of the companies Peters championed in his book quickly floundered.  Some of Collins' sainted companies are already floundering as well...    Books like Good to Great prey on the fact that you napped through statistics--if you'd been caffeined up during those dull lectures, you'd have remembered the fallacy of composition (the coin flipper's exercise), the distinction between random outcomes and relevant ones, and the enormous difference between what's causal and what's coincidental.    Look, there's nothing new in business:  there are only a few basic strategies, and only a few macro and microeconomic truths.  Ever notice how fads like supply side economics, the Japanization of America, the endless bull market, the end of history, The New Economy and the Macarena all seemed to collapse under the weight of basic market concepts you already knew?    So SNAP OUT OF IT, gulp down that double espresso, go back to your old and boring (but still accurate and useful) Michael Porter, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Benjamin Graham, and Burton Malkiel, and stop chasing misallocated or downright blockheaded metaphors from Who Moved My Cheese, The Art of War and poor, misunderstood Charles Darwin, and for God's sake, please take a pass on this Three Card Monte of a book.
B000001E8P|5.0|I bought this album when I was a young boy, and \\"Common People\\" captured my attention. I really liked the melody, and being a 12-year old boy at the time, I saved up my measly allowance and bought this album for the song. Lo and behold, I didn't listen to the other songs very often, and I soon forgot I had this album.<BR>I dug the album out of its hidden place near the end of 1999 and gave it a chance, and I finally realized what I was missing the first time I heard it: the sexual innuendo, the great song structures, the insanely catchy melodies. \\"Disco 2000\\" quickly became a favorite of mine, and everytime I hear it, I can see metrosexual Britons singing it in the clubs at the height of Britpop mania.<BR>In my opinion, this album outclasses and outshines the offerings of Blur (The Great Escape) and Oasis (What's the Story Morning Glory) in 1995: when music historians look back on the good, bad and ugly of the Britpop scene, this album will stand head and shoulders above any other albums and be regarded as a true (lost) classic of the turbulent 1990s. Get it today and see what you've been missing all this time.
B000000OAA|5.0|I've been into Queen for a very long time, and Sheer Heart Attack is definitely their most flawless effort, in ny opinion, with Queen II coming in a very close second. It shows their versatility, sophistication and edge without having a song sound out of place or obstentanious. It starts off with &quot;Brighton Rock,&quot; one of their greatest rockers, which has Freddie Mercury portraying a man meeting a woman (in his trademark falsetto and masculine vocals divded between the two characters), and the awe-inspiring guitar skills of Brian May. &quot;Now I'm here&quot; also follows in the same path, with anthemic guitars, awesome voclas and pure energy, and &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot; set the groundwork for bands like Metallica, in terms of speed. Many of the songs are more epic and dramatic, such as &quot;In the Lap of Gods,&quot; and &quot;Flick of the Wrist,&quot; as well as the campy, Broadway-esque &quot;Bring Back that Leroy Brown.&quot; Even the quick and upbeat &quot;Misfire&quot; is a highlight on this album. All 4 members of the band contributed very worthy songs and ideas to this album, and their talents at each of their instruments is more than obvious (though frankly, May and Mercury had the lion's share of talent in the band, in terms of performance and composition).Many people thought that their next album, A Night at the Opera, was their finest accomplishment, and Opera was a great album, but in my opinion this one was even better. All of the songs were perfect on Sheer Heart Attack, and contains many of their finest songs.
B000003TBP|3.0|Ah, Odelay! the scrap-pile/loser album of the decade (minus the &quot;loser&quot; single, of course.)  It was 1996 and dreary-eyed masses were coming off their 5-year grunge hangover, desperate for anything other than alt-rock.  Beck proved the perfect fix, with an ecletic style and some funky music.  The critics drooled and all summer long you could here an impossibly distorted &quot;Where it's at&quot; blasting from every car stuck at a stoplight.  Or the New Pollution.  Or Devil's Haircut.  It didn't matter; this was good stuff.  <br />In fact, the entire album is filled to the brim with good stuff: good hooks, good bass lines, good atmosphere.  But it's absolutely drenched in schizophrenic details that distract rather than complement.  The cell phone blips at the end of Novacane, the 3 or 4 &quot;breakdowns&quot; littering Where It's At, the scream introducing Lord Only Knows...Buried somewhere beneath all of these obscure, smart-@ss samples and off-key freakout flourishes are some great songs, but Beck keeps himself and his listeners too focused on how brilliant he is.  <br />The diversity of genres and decades he pulls from is certainly impressive, but he has no business declaring on the back of the cd cover &quot;je suis un revolutionaire&quot; when he knows Todd Rundgren did this is in '73 and the Beasties in '89.  Conclusion:  Killer party music? You bet!  90's masterpiece?  Move on...
B000002MY3|1.0|This cd is just some idiot venting her mindless frustrations under the disguise of music. The lyrics are moronic and the voice has a screeching quality of excruciating proportions. She sounds like a cat with a digestive disorder singing into a fan. Stay away from this, unless you are experimenting with a new pain killer and wish to generate a massive headache for a trial.

076790592X|3.0|I just reviewed the author's another book, &quot;Five People You Meet in Heaven.&quot;  I wrote that both the authors and his books are way over-rated.  <br />I find Morrie as a person very charming and adorable.  As I do not get to know Morrie in person, I have no choice but to take everything written by the author about Morrie at face value.  Morrie would be a great person and teacher to meet and learn from.  I also find that many of his views reflect teaching of Buddhism, and I get a taste of Zen in there as well.  As the author put it, &quot;Morrie borrowed from many religions.&quot;  <br />As on the author, again, I find him unimpressive as a writer.  The book could have been written in no more than half its length without losing anything except some revenues.  Indeed, in this book, there are only several core messages from Morrie, and these can be well delivered in 50 pages.<br />I have lost several loved ones in my life.  I watched them became sick, I took care of them, including wiping their bottoms, and I watched them die.  While every person has different ways of dealing with such a situation, the author simply failed to &quot;touch the deepest part of the heart.&quot;  <br />Overall, I love Morrie and he deserved 5 stars.  But I took away 2 stars as this is not a well written book.  Worth reading though.  I am going to buy &quot;Morrie: in his own words.&quot;  I don't think we need the author's filtering in delivering Morrie's wisdom and messages to us.  Let's go to the original source.

B000068IEU|1.0|Dont get me wrong , i love wes craven and think he is brilliant for creating a nightmare on elm street and scream was ok. But this movie sucked. Me and my friend rented this one night thinking it would be good because wes did it. lol we were wrong. This film wasnt scary at all just wierd. the plot was stupid , the characters were very strange ( not in a good way either), the actors in the roles were really bad and couldnt act , they had no charm about them or interesting qualitys as in lets say the characters in texas chainsaw massacre/ and in the end the father is comin after people with a chainsaw , it isnt scary just laughable.- i dont know if i should say it was funny cause it didnt even have humor to it , it was just funny that such a great guy like wes could make somthin as bad as this.  The person i was watching it with was asking me why the hec i picked out somthin so stupid to watch and was begging me to turn it off/ the film is very low quality low budget and not that thats bad , because the texas chainsaw massacre was low budget and turned out to be amazing but this thing just sucked. They say this movie is groundbreaking- well when my friend said why did u get this i used that as an excuse (( its supposedly a well known groundbreaking horror film)) and they laughed. I didnt find the film that good either. Sorry wes
B000002ADT|2.0|I picked this up to try and expand my horizons in music and honestly this leaves me cold. The recording quality is stellar, the playing is great, yet the recordings themselves meander around with no direction... for 10 minutes, and then they end. I discern no cohesive melodies. I like jazz, or at least I thought I did, but aren't songs, even jazz songs, supposed to have some sort of patterns? I chalk the universal praise of this cd to mass hysteria and being too afraid to stand up and say, &quot;You know what? This is boring.&quot; There seems like there should be dialogue going on, because this seems like background music from a movie. If you're trying to round out a collection, this could pass, but if this is your first taste of jazz head straight for the desert.
0385507755|5.0|Few books have left me wanting to meet the author and have lunch with him.  This book did.  Long after I finished reading it, I thought about the characters and their lives.  While I come from a family with addiction, to love this book and be touched by it, one does not have to.  While one of the reviewers did not like the writing style, it is exactly, in my opinion, what made this book so great.  A reader does not need quotation marks to understand who is speaking.  Frey wrote, as Conrad said in his review, like a poet.  It is simply an amazing book that should be read by all and more than once.
B000084T18|1.0|On this album, the notorious Penny Sack proves that there is absolutely no talent required to be rich and famous. First of all, Couch Change is just a blatant hypocrite. Although 90% of this album involves violence and bein gangsta, that really isn't who Loose Nickels really is. Now I'm not necessarily saying that I condone murder, but when most rappers talk about it, they are just letting people know what their lives are like, in Five Dimes' case, it is just a way to exploit that lifestyle which he does not share. Sure, he may act all tough and invincible on tracks, but in real life he puts restraining orders put on anyone that threatens him.<BR>As for the actual album, nearly every track would sound the same, if not for the instrumentals. The exception to this would be '21 questions' in which he displays further hypocrisy by putting out the same, soft, lame kind of tracks that he insults Ja Fool for. And every one of Minor Refund's rhymes consist of pathetic, uninspired, simplistic garbage, where usually only 2 words in a bar(two lines) actually rhyme.<BR>To sum it all up, this album is a waste of your time and money. Yet if you really must hear this, just get the bootleg for two bucks on your corner. <BR>Also, does it ever occur to people that if talented rappers like Jay-Z, Scar Face, Hicee and others are dissing Laundrey Money, there's something wrong with him?<BR>If you want some good rap then you should get some; Big L, Tupac, Biggie Smalls, Immortal Technique, Canibus, Scar Face, Hicee, Bone Thugs, Onyx, Jedi Mind Tricks, Talib Kweli, Mosdef, or maybe some of Eminem's early albums.<BR>Oh, and despite what 69 and a number of other morons think, Seven Thirty is nowhere near Pac's level.
0805062971|5.0|Chuck Palahaniuk is awesome. I read this book after I saw the movie (about 10 times). So if I hadn't seen the movie first I would have given this book 5 stars, thus my 5 star rating. However, if you have seen the movie many times you won't get much out of this book. The movie and the book are very, very similar, so much so that I, as someone who has seen the movie and owns it, didn't get much out of the book. I still enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone as (yet again) a wonderful social commentary by a sarcastic mastermind.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I can't say too much other than this is Radiohead at their absolute creative best. Every single song is polished to perfection with so many musical elements that it is often difficult to listen to the song and hear all that's going on. I am a huge Radiohead fan and I love this album; my copy often doesn't play because I've listened to it so many times.<BR>If you don't own this, go out and buy it right now! It is as essential as the Beatles's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band or Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or Led Zeppelin IV. Every song is musically amazing (except perhaps for the bizarre and disturbing notes of Fitter Happier, which I'm not sure can be considered as &quot;music&quot; but can still be appreciated by a hard-core Radiohead fan). The tracks are astounding; Karma Police, the ultimate mix of swirling electronic sounds, piano, hard overdriven guitar, and acoustic chords, and No Surprises, perhaps the album's most stunning and perfect track, and of course, Paranoid Android, the album's most chaotic, powerful, and well-known track.<BR>I can't see how anyone would rate this anything under 5 stars. As a musician myself (Radiohead songs from this album and others often pound out of my amp) I can appreciate this musical equivalent of a breath of fresh air that has not grown stale from its 1997 release. Radiohead are amazing. Buy this.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I agree to the earlier reviewer who asked what so many low marks for &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; says about the current state of US society. When I look at Amazon web sites elsewhere in the world I find it very much appreciated, as - I think - it deserves to be. It seems only in America that people are so intolerant of something that is not to their taste, even though it is so meaningful to the others.<br />I see people using words like &quot;art&quot;, &quot;subtlety&quot;, &quot;vision&quot;, and &quot;slowness&quot; like they are dirty words. This is a movie for people who do not find them dirty words. <br />To me, &quot;Dinner With Andre&quot; was more exciting than many movies about car crashes, because it was about exciting ideas. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is more exciting because it is about exciting emotions. Love. Friendship. Loss.<br />It is important to know that &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is not so much a comedy. Like life, it is funny at times, poignant at others. The scriptwriting is excellent. It is an art to know when not to make people talk and let them tell the story with their face. <br />This isn't an expensive film. It is a small film that - if you love it - speaks to you very honestly and openly. It's not about production values. It is about people. <br />Sometimes in a desert you come upon an oasis, where you are refreshed and find exactly what you need. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is such an oasis from a film industry that is often more like the sand.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|There's nothing new about this movie. It's exactly the same as the first. It's not better, but it's not worse either. Will Smith &amp; Tommy Lee Jones reteam as Agent Jay, and Agent Kay respectively, and are joined by Lara Flynn Boyle (super anorexic chick who used to date Jack Nicholson).<br />What I found with this movie is that the roles of Will and Tommy have been reversed. Now &quot;Kevin&quot; is the one who doesn't have a clue what he is doing.<br />You've got the same old aliens, some of which are really funny if you look out for them. Frank the pug is back, with a bigger and better role, and a hilarious scene where he sings &quot;I Will Surive&quot; the Gloria Gaynor classic. I nearly had an accident after watching that! It's so funny.<br />There are quite a few cameos in this, and you need to keep your eyes peeled for them. There is one rather obvious one, which will have you guessing - MICHAEL JACKSON appears as an agent in this. I found it very hard to believe it was actually him. Barry Sonnenfeld is the husband in the family watching TV when Jay, Kay and the Worm Dudes walk in to collect some guns; Tommy Lee Jones' daughter (as the daughter in K's old apartment) and Will Smith's sons (the two boys who look up as J and K fly overhead) - and I'm also sure one of his sons appears in the video for &quot;Nod Ya Head&quot;. Rick Baker is the alien makeup effects master who appears in the MIB Headquarters at the Alien Registration counter, his trademark hair gives him away. The little bratty girl who wants Rugrats stamps in the post office is Chloe Sonnenfeld, daughter of director Barry Sonnenfeld.

The extras include an audio commentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld with optional telestrator diagrams; an alien broadcast, by Agent Tee (which features celebrity &quot;aliens&quot; - on this DVD it's mainly British stars, Richard Madeley, Caprice and Vernon Kay, but it is quite funny); a special animated short film, which you will find in the trailers, called &quot;The Chubb Chubbs!&quot; It's quite weird, and I thought it was a trailer.

Then you have all the exclusive featurettes: Looping MIB II, Alien esoterica, Serleena animatica, 'Rick Baker' (Special make up effects), Danny Elfman (Original Score), Bo Welch (Art/Production Design), Foley Artists, Frank the Pug, Jarra, Jeebs, Jeff the Worm, Scrad/Charlie, Serleena, The Worms, Barry Sonnenfeld's Intergalactic Guide to Comedy and finally the video for &quot;Nod Ya Head&quot;. Phew!<br />If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one, and you'll definitely like Frank the pug. Just don't expect anything different or new.

B000024JEX|5.0|If you like Keith Jarrett's music and especially his work with the Standards Trio, you'll love this box set consisting of 6 albums recorded on three consecutive nights in the summer of 1994 at At The Blue Note in New York. The albums are beautifully recorded, and in my opinion the sound is even better than their studio recordings. The drums are very much in front in the soundscape, so it's easy to hear all of Jack DeJohnette's creative playing.<br />Another reviewer for this box set said that &quot;There's also unparalleled &quot;attitude,&quot; &quot;ego,&quot; &quot;self-belief,&quot; and a canny sense of self-promotion.&quot; I can see what he means, but if that makes for better music, why does it matter? I think that Keith's attitude, ego, self-belief and so on contributes to the music in a way that the music is more recognized in the improvisation process. What I mean by that is also what Keith himself writes in the linear notes: &quot;[The music] must be let in, recognized, and revealed to the listener, the first of which is the musician him/herself. This recognition is the most misunderstood part of the process (even by musicians). It is a discrimination against mechanical pattern, for content, against habit, for surprise [...]. It is like an attempt, over and over again to reveal the heart of things.&quot; Though this recognition part of the improvisation process is practised among all other great jazz musicians, I think Keith has his skill fully developed. And if you're going to hear these albums or some of them, you have to be open, because if you're not, every ballad is just going to sound like it always have been; if you're open, on the other hand, you can hear how the trio constantly tries to &quot;reveal the heart of things.&quot;<br />What I favour before the other albums by the Standards Trio is the variance of the playing. In spite of the fact that these 6 albums were recorded in a weekend, the trio never bores you. It's incredible how creative andimaginative they can be.
0440234743|5.0|John Grisham continues to write books that not only inform you of the law, but he makes it interesting. <BR>I had just lost my father when this book was released. So it was funny, reliving some of the same emotions shared by the characters in this story. You never know why the dead leaves things has they do, but there is always a good story behind them. That can only be told from the grave. I love this book, find out where the inheritance was hide, who took it, and who got it in the end. Try to figure out, where it all came from. Why it was never utilize? Questions that can only be answered when you read the book! Buy it you will love it!
B0000VCZKM|1.0|Nope. Why? Where is the widescreen? Why is this movie missing nearly half the picture on this DVD? Now, I did not buy it on that account. I have the original release of the wide/fullscreen DVD, but I'd enjoy hearing its new dts sound. And why no commentary (or is it not listed)? I've heard the director is sadly deceased, so no commentary from him. Aren't those who played the orphans out there (April&quot;Kate&quot;Lerman, Rosanne&quot;Pepper&quot;Sorrentino, Lara&quot;Tessie&quot;Berk, Lucie&quot;July&quot;Stewart, and of course Aileen&quot;Annie&quot;Quinn)? No documentary entitled &quot;Lights, Camera, Annie&quot;?When I found this movie was re-released on DVD in the condition it is on vhs, I suddenly had a feeling of spontanious combustion, yet I kept my mind and finally got the old,used and better version of Annie (the way it was ment to be and the way I wanted to see it-2.35:1). So much for SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY EDITON's. Now my jaded personality wants widescreen with 5.1 channels of sound and a commentary track (maybe 2 tracks). Is that too much to ask?

B0000VAFO0|4.0|It's hard to decide whether I like Underworld or not. It is definitely a bold movie taking you into the world of darkness where now, vampires are at war with the lycans. I find it hard to like is simply because I'm sympathetic to the humans who are naturally caught in the middle. Though not shown in this movie, we can take for granted that humans will always be cattle. <br />The story is intertwined with love and blood feud like one of those shakespearean plays. Vampires warring with lycans and no one knows why. Selene is a memeber of the DeathDealers, vampires sworn to hunt and kill lycans. No one knows exactly why they are fighting or how it began and it is forbidden to search into the past. Now, the fabled lycan leader, Lucian, has reappeared and Selene feels that this could spell doom for the vampires. Plus she suspects that there is something wrong with the leadership in the vampire coven itself, namely, Kraven. <br />It's definitely action packed and I'm sure a sequel is to follow.  I enjoyed the plot twists though the love-theme didn't seems to develop but rather, just happen much like the big bang theory. The characters are definitely interesting. Not likable, especially for me, because I hate vampires and lycans both. The movie does a good job in not progessing into a gory horror show, but rather keep it to the action genre. It's definitely worth the watch for both story and good action.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|Let's face facts - the fifties were a horribly stifling time for women and had this movie not portrayed them as so, it would have been a distortion of truth.  Elite New England universities were notoriously conservative and the importance of 'clean' appearances was strictly enforced. A character such as Katharine, the rebellious art history professor would have made herself a mark for challenging the values of said establishment, no matter how beloved she was by her fellow students.<br />The reason I gave this film only two stars was that it constantly second guessed itself.  Towards the beginning of the film, Katharine refuses faculty housing because she refuses to live in a place where she cannot have male visitors.  Later on, when she's rented a room somewhere else, the same restriction applies.  She pushes Joan (by incorrectly assuming she would want to have both career and family) into applying for Yale and when Joan choses to get married, gets properly called out for wanting others to do as she says, not as they would.<br />Also, when was the influence of Katharine over Betty taking place? As far as I could tell, they couldn't stand each other.  Personally I think Betty was being correctly advised by Giselle, the one character who did seemed human and fallible.  Even though she was intelligent and well-spoken, the fact Giselle was free thinking and sexually active almost set her up for the inevitable \\"slut self destructs\\" storyline. I'm glad they nicked that in the bud, as the scene in the dorm room after Giselle catches Betty's no-good husband Spenser in New York showed.  Giselle passed up the opportunity to shatter Betty publicly to instead be a good friend to her.  Had this movie possessed more moments like this, it would have been well-balanced and more enjoyable.<br />One good thing that comes from the fifties/early sixties period movies that have been made in the past few years (Pleasantville, Far From Heaven and Down with Love) is that it finally establishes that those days are past us.  They are now only fit for nicely shot movies and pretty soundtrack recordings.ishes that those days are past us.  They are now only fit for nicely shot movies and pretty soundtrack recordings.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The whole time my wife amd I watched this film, we couldn't leave it for a minute. Aside from the incredible acting, the film showed disturbingly clear how a whole sect of the human race could be isolated and left open for violation. It was so slow and subtle, that people didn't realize what was happening before it was too big to stop. I have also watched Schindler's List which was more disturbing as a whole, but much more stark in it's telling. This movie is on a more intimate level and I consider it to be one of the best I've ever seen. Warning- there are some extremely disturbing scenes in this movie-stark, and brutal that will stay with you. And one note to the person from New York that wrote-BORING-, did you know that this was a true story? That the effort by people to hide the pianist was because he was considered a national treasure? Or are you really that narrow-minded that nobody suffers like us? Buy this movie? Most definitely!!!

B00005JN1L|3.0|OK, so I saw the film last night in the theatre, my boyfriend and I seated amidst a throng of mostly teenage girls and a couple of their boyfriends.  The trailers ran in exactly this order, by genre: chick flick, suspense thriller, chick flick, suspense thriller, chick flick, suspense thriller.  Like clockwork I tell ya.  Now normally if I'm seeing a film and there are as many as three previews targeted at the Britney demo, no matter how they try to buffer it, I run out screaming in a cloud of popcorn and Sour Patch Kids; but in this case I assured myself that Johnny Depp's mere name on the project accounted for all its associations with projects starring Julia Styles and such-like.  I was only there myself because I happened to read the story by Stephen King upon which it's based (by accident, I swear), and I wanted to compare and contrast or something.  I can't say I was very hopeful of it being a masterpiece or necessarily, you know, watchable - I'm a veteran of \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" - but I had the night to kill so whatever.<br />Anyway, the film starts off right in line with the book, although Mr. Depp naturally cuts more of a bohemian swath than I had pictured for the protagonist, Mort Rainey.  Everything is rushed along for time, but the deal in a nutshell is that erstwhile fiction author Mort just got divorced after finding his wife in bed with a third party, and he now spends most of every day sleeping on the couch in his isolated vacation house on the lake, she having predictably landed their primary residence in town.  He tries to write but can't; he's obviously depressed, still trying to get over the apparent senselessness of his wife's infidelity.  And because he's Johnny Depp, all this is powerful stuff for the teenage girls in the audience, who go crazy over his slovenly, dejected magnetism.  I daresay that's one subtext that wasn't present in the book.  Then, seemingly just to complicate things for Mort at this vulnerable time in his life, some crazy backwoods lunatic from Mississippi (name of John Shooter) shows up at his door and accuses him of \\"stealing his story.\\"  Mort knows he wrote the story in question and that therefore this guy is nuts, but he can't convince the guy of same.  You know where this is going.  Before long the guy starts to terrorize our sexy little reject, slaying his pets and destroying his property and threatening further vengeance until Mort \\"sets things right\\" by writing a new ending and giving Shooter credit for it.<br />This is one departure from King's short story, in which both men's versions are complete and virtually identical start to finish, and Shooter asks for an entirely new story to be written.  But the major departure is the ending, which I'll have the courtesy not to discuss.  The movie takes it in an entirely different direction, presumably just to give it a little more punch, but I've still heard all the critics complain that it peters out at the end.  And really, it does.  Once you figure out the \\"twist,\\" which could happen at any point in the film because it is the most commonplace plot twist EVER, you probably just won't care anymore, cuz the film doesn't offer much further.<br />I wasn't necessarily \\"disappointed\\" with \\"Secret Window,\\" but I think I mentioned what my expectations were.  It was a little more interesting than it might have been, and all else aside, Johnny Depp did a decent job - I didn't expect the character to dress like that and have that particular hair but it never really seemed at odds with him, even added a certain dimension of mild interest.  (Actually, imagine if they got somebody as infernally boring as Ben Affleck to play Mort - in that event \\"Window\\" would definitively suck, although it would still draw the same audience.)  I definitely think they could've picked a much more intimidating redneck to play John Shooter; Turturro scares me about as much as Martha Stewart.  I was thinking of DeNiro in \\"Cape Fear\\" mixed with oh, the Marlboro Man or somebody.  I guess my final verdict would be: see this if you have nothing else to do.  But basically that just means: find something else to do.

B0000542D1|4.0|First off, whoever wrote that this film ripped off the Spice Girls is obviously not paying attention to the fact that &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; came out in 1964 and &quot;Spice World&quot; came out about thirty years later, so I believe that means the Spice Girls ripped off the Beatles, not vice versa. Anyway, this film is a great piece, and though not a very good representation of the Beatles, it features their classic songs, some humor, and you gotta love that classic black and white. There are some dull moments, but for anyone interested in this time period it's a must-see.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Julie Roberts portrays Katherine Watson an Art History Professor beginning her first year of teaching at the prestigious Wellesley College in the Fall of 1953.  As a Native of California she moves to New England for what she believes to be a great opportunity to teach other women.  What she finds is a great invisible wall that divides her from her students by breeding and class not to mention ideals.  Katherine Watson is energized by individuality and free thinking.  Her students are driven by social status and the goal of marriage.  <br />The Wellesley students are all young women of high society.  Their main focus in life is to find the perfect husband, live in the perfect house and have an \\"x\\" number of children.  They are instructed on how to help their future husbands advance in their careers versus having one of their own.  They are schooled in taking a back seat to everyone and everything.<br />The theme of feminism is not missed here.  Watson poignantly points out to her students that women have made various educational advancements only not to advance on a personal level.  More education has merely placed more pressure on women to become what society deems the perfect wife and mother in her fancy dress, high heels and pearls will vacuuming the house and having dinner at 5.  Watson wants the girls to see their own potential.  Mona Lisa (Watson's nickname due to being an Art teacher) is just a few generations ahead of her time.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|First of all, I will admit that this film is not for everyone. And people have questioned the \\"lack of no plot\\" (as some would say), and the \\"weird sexual relationship\\" between the two protagonists. But this film, is like having one of those sernedity moments, of just exploring you mind on your life, as you stare up into space.But I think that people will get disappointed, that with all the \\"critics\\" hype, they expect a clear beginning,middle, and end. And, I think that if you never felt like you never had a connection with a person you just met, than perhaps you wont understand the relationship between Bob and Charlotte. There relationship is nothing sexual, but you can tell that, they were made for each other. There soul-mates that share a connection. And Tokyo acts as a background to all these, giving the feeling of loss, and isolation from their home(America). But there relationship contents full of unqiue honest moments, in which they use each other to understand themselves better. Its kinda like one of those close intimate friendships, where you find a instant bond with each other, as well as learning from each other, and than parting. Is not sad, its bittersweet and leaves the sense of moving forward in time.<BR>I must say that this film, is gorgeous in showing the beauty of the city, and Sofia Coppola, has done it again!! I love the Virgin Suicides, and I must say that Lost in Translation shows more of the depth, and brillance that is contended in Sofia. <BR>I dont recommend this movie to others, but I must say that I (a 16 year old) loved the feeling of the film. And in particualr, I must give thanks for Sofia, for writting/directing this poigant little gem ! Keep up the brilliant work !!

B000005IZ8|5.0|I was afraid of minimalist music at one time.  In a nutshell, if you are looking to minimalist music, this is a safe way to start.  While this wasn't my first minimalist CD, it is by far my favorite.  Because it is a soundtrack, no song goes very long and each track is slightly different allowing you to be choosey with what tracks you want to listen to.  Yet, this is still minimalist.  For those of you who like intelligent composition, the reoccurring themes develop great intrigue in changing meters, different orchestration, and the use of rhythm to develop melody the trade mark of minimalist music.  Everyone will like the beautiful native South American melodies intertwined into those of the Indian, African, and Chinese themes.  This album is one of three in the \\"Qatsi trilogy\\", and while the others have their moments this is by far the best.

B0000E6I1J|5.0|This CD is great.  However, I only have one negative thing to say, one of the best performances on the DVD was left off the CD, which is the, &quot;Horse to Water&quot;, track by Sam Brown.  I realize there is only so much room, but this really should have been included, she is a great performer. This CD is truly exceptional. It is a wonderful tribute to George Harrison's brilliant work, played by a fabulous band of his friends.  While I do like the Indian music, I am glad they put it on a seperate disc.  This is a terrific piece of work by many talented artists, and everyone should own it.

B000002I6T|5.0|Back in the late 60's session albums seemed all the rage as the &quot;Incestuous League of Extraordinary West Coast Musicians&quot; assembled at various intervals to party and occasionally record.  Some efforts were truely forgettable, witness Jefferson Starship's first attempt to escape earth in a stolen spacecraft (Blows Against the Empire).  <BR>However the same group of individuals, plus or minus a few came together (with David Geffen's help) to produce, despite marginal recording engineering work, an enduring album albiet with a very long title.<BR>David Crosby's effort, &quot;If I could only remember my name&quot; is a wonderfully complex yet raw compilation of songs that range form almost jazzy in Tamalpais High to rock (Cowboy Movie) to protest (What Are Their Names?)to the frighteningly ethereal finish in &quot;I'd Swear There Was Somebody There&quot;, a beautiful quasi-Gegorian chant perportedly done by Mr. Crosby alone at the recording studio in the middle of the night.<BR>He is supported by the usual West Coast suspects of that era including Jorma Kaoukonen, Jack Cassidy, Paul Kantner and Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane fame, Jerry Garcia, Joni Mitchell, Graham Nash, Neil Young, drummer Michael Shrieve and a host of other well and lesser knowns.<BR>Crosby's ability to meld these disparate musicians into a coherent mix that has stood the test of time is nothing short of phenomenal.  Although he has had subsequent flashes of brilliance (Delta on CSN's Daylight Again and a number of songs on his latest incarnation with his band CPR) Mr. Crosby's appetite for self-destruction since the production of &quot;If I Could Only... has rendered this title of the wonderful &quot;album&quot; almost prophetic and may have deprived us Crosby fans of more great music.<BR>Be that as it may &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot; is more than a good listen, it catches essence of the the LA and San Franciso sound and mood of the late 60's.  The songs will grow on youand speak even to younger listeners today who have the patience to listen to themes that cross generational lines.
B00005JN1L|2.0|While I'm glad I was able to catch the film, I was quite annoyed by the experience of seeing it at the Mall (big surprise). Of the twenty or so other people in the theater for the Saturday night late show, 16 of them were teenyboppers. It might as well have been a packed house, though, with all of the distractions. There were conversations galore (why do people have to carry on melodramatic conversations about dumb high-school romances and bad hair DURING a movie?), and no less than FOUR times did LOUD cell phones ring (different cell phones from different people with different ring tones -- \\"Ride of the Valkries\\" was only one of them)!!!<br />Still, I enjoyed the flick. It was interesting (though somewhat predictable), and Johnny Depp was a joy to watch, as usual. He looked like he was having fun with the role, and that made it a bit better than it probably would have been. The film was less graphic in the violence than I expected. While it hints at the violence, it doesn't actually show a lot of it -- just bits and pieces. There's some gore, but it's not over-the-top.<br />Of course the film is like a regurgitated The Dark Half. I've never read the original short story here, so I'm not sure how similar the film is to the actual story, but I found it odd that Stephen King would revisit the same territory so obviously similarly. Interestingly, Timothy Hutton was cast in a somewhat major supporting role in Secret Window, and he was the main character in The Dark Half, Thad Beaumont/George Stark.<br />I think, perhaps, the film bordered on boredom (say that three times fast). Depp gave it a little comic relief (i.e. his disheveled appearance, quirky mannerisms, and wild looks every time he catches himself doing something odd) made the character less caricature and more realistic than he probably would have been in the hands of a less-accomplished actor. Depp took a one-dimensional character and blew it full of air (sometimes hot air, but air nonetheless), and he managed to make something interesting out of it.<br />One the other hand, while John Turturo as the mysterious \\"Shooter\\" was equally interesting, he was less believable and not as threatening as he probably should have been. His quirky demeanor was at times creepy, but he lacked any semblance of villainy and therefore seemed far less menacing than King's similar haunted writer/doppleganger, George Stark. Hence, it seemed as though the film was holding back. It's not in-your-face spooky and it's the subject matter is not sufficiently explored toward it's most disturbing end. Instead, the movie plays a bit like a cross between a made-for-tv USA thriller and an episode of Tales from the Crypt. It's fun to watch, mostly because of Depp, but it's got about as much meat on its bones as exists in a boiling pot of corn on the cob.<br />Gone are the classic King films like Pet Cemetary, Cujo, The Dead Zone, Salem's Lot, Children of the Corn, The Shining, etc... Instead, we're left with shaky and wobbling attempts at thought-provoking cinema from King like the more recent cinematic flop Dreamcatcher, the television monstrosity Rose Red and other mixed-bags of bones like The Langoliers. It seems King's best film adaptations in a long time rest with The Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis, but perhaps it's fair to say that the strength of those films, like this one, lie less in the script and more in the exceptional thespians who bring the characters to life.<br />I find it difficult to blame King for the film's weaknesses however. I wasn't impressed by David Koepp's screenplay nor his direction. I thought it lacked the umpff of some of his earlier work vis-a-vis Stir of Echoes and The Trigger Effect (both of which he also wrote and directed). Instead, this film was about as exciting and predictable as his Panic Room (which he wrote) -- in other words, it was at times quite flat.<br />I give it two stars. It's good for a matinee or a short wait for the dvd.ged to make something interesting out of it. <br />One the other hand, while John Turturo as the mysterious \\"Shooter\\" was equally interesting, he was less believable and not as threatening as he probably should have been.

It seems King's best film adaptations in a long time rest with The Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis, but perhaps it's fair to say that the strength of those films, like this one, lie less in the script and more in the exceptional thespians who bring the characters to life.<br />I find it difficult to blame King for the film's weaknesses however. I wasn't impressed by David Koepp's screenplay nor his direction. I thought it lacked the umpff of some of his earlier work vis-a-vis Stir of Echoes and The Trigger Effect (both of which he also wrote and directed). Instead, this film was about as exciting and predictable as his Panic Room (which he wrote) -- in other words, it was at times quite flat. <br />I give it two stars. It's good for a matinee or a short wait for the dvd.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the only series that I've ever liked enough to buy two copies on DVD: one to keep, and one to send to my father, who hasn't liked any TV show in the last thirty years.  I started watching Firefly because I liked Joss Whedon's other shows, and indeed it shares with &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; the knuckleball plot twists, complex characters, and smart, snappy dialogue of a typical Whedonesque show.  That said, Firefly is a very different series from anything that has come along in a long time.  It is a science fiction show designed to appeal to people who prefer human dramas and landscapes to the planet-sized allegories and latex aliens of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.  It is a western, but one that shifts in tone from the lighter episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot; to the murkiness of &quot;The Searchers,&quot; and back again.  Its worst moments are less cliched than almost every other TV drama, and in its best moments word, image, and sound combine into surprising, touching lyricism and beauty.
0783114893|4.0|Seeing this on HBO this morning with the negative experience of \\"Vanishing Point\\" still fresh in my mind reminded me that yes, there are some great road movies that take place in the American Southwest which do not leave the viewers questioning the significance of the film...and prefer merely to scare the hell out of them instead.<br />The plot is staggeringly effective in its simplicity; a college kid (C. Thomas Howell) contracts to deliver a car from Chicago to San Diego.  In the desert during a storm he picks up a hitch hiker (Rutger Hauer) who doesn't bother with the pretense of winning his mobile host's faith and trust; he immediately slips into maximum creep-out mode and the kid knows he's in serious trouble within minutes as the hitcher makes it known under no uncertain terms that he has indeed killed someone in a particularly brutal fashion...and with a seeming trace of resignation and inevitability he plans to do the same to the kid.<br />What follows is a fortuitous escape and a series of subsequent encounters between Howell and Hauer, with entanglements involving the police, Jennifer Jason Leigh (thankfully before she picked up that horrible New England upper class accent she seemed to use in a number of her '90's roles), and more murder victims.<br />The encounters succeed in building a sense of escalating tension that is never satisfactorily resolved until the film's ending, which does seem somewhat contrived (minus one star for that).  However, the performances of all the actors are excruciatingly believable, especially Hauer, who is genuinely disturbing.  He's not some sort of supernatural teen slasher a la Jason or Freddy Krueger or (to a lesser extent) Michael Myers, classic horror movie icons all; Hauer is simply someone...ANYONE...that could cross your path without any warning or fanfare...and could make your personal terrorization his sole purpose in life.  That is what makes this movie truly scary; while watching it you will clearly understand the implication that yes, this too could happen to you.<br />\\"Riders on the storm\\", indeed.he implication that yes, this too could happen to you.<br />\\"Riders on the storm\\", indeed.
B00014K5TQ|2.0|I think if you could get through the bad acting and the bad set then this movie might be ok.  I remember watching this movie and in the very beginning saying to myself this is about as low budget as you could possible get. But the bad acting maybe it hard to follow.  I guess all you can say is the Home Alone Boy has really grown up!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I had to get this CD as soon as I can without my mom around who does not like her. I loved `Me against the music' and `Toxic' before I got my dad to buy it for me. I popped it in the CD player in my computer and I loved it all. Good job Britney! She's been on her stride since 'Baby one more time'. She is the best singer from U.S. besides Madonna. <br />Everytime: 10/10 A haunting ballad. Her voice sounds lovely! One of the most gorgeous ballads I ever heard. A highlight. Very well written and SHE HELPED WRITE IT 2. The best ballad of Britney's by far. A true pop ballad. I'd give it 100/10 if I can. <BR>Brave New Girl: 8/10 I get this 80's vibe when I hear this. Catchy, you want to sing along with it.<BR>Shadow: 9/10 A nice ballad. This song will follow you around like a shadow. <BR>The hook up: 9/10 Sounds like early Pink may bring back memories of \\"Oops. I did it again\\". Very R+B. It's catchy! <BR>Touch of my hand: 7/10 Okay! .... <BR>Outrageous: 6/10 Hip-Hop but it needs more catch. Beware of sexual tinged lyrics. But you can't blame her for trying.<BR>Toxic: 10/10 HOT! With weird strings in the background, catchy chorus and awesome video. This is a classic!<BR>Early Morning: 10/10 Sounds a little like Sean Paul's `Get Busy'. Really catchy! Really sexy and fun. Thumbs Up!<BR>Breathe on Me: 8/10 Sounds like a Kylie Minogue song with an electronica beat.  <BR>Showdown: 6.5/10 Read Outrageous but slightly better than it. <BR>I got that (Boom Boom) 8/10 Very HOT hip hop track featuring the Ying Yang twins.<BR>Me against the music: 10/10 This track is brilliant. Two generations of pop superstars collaborate for this Awesome song.
B000002NJS|5.0|this is by far one of the best albums ever, i don't think there's anything like it! not exactly what you'd expect from madonna if you're a fan of her &quot;like a virgin&quot; days, but its the best she's ever done, nonetheless. songs like &quot;ray of light&quot;, &quot;skin&quot;, and &quot;sky fits heaven&quot; really pump you up and  it gives you a good-feel vibe, not to mention in this album, she's got such a beautiful voice! it's definitely not your usual pop sound like, say, &quot;material girl&quot;, there is a lot of electronica and techno, but you don't have to be a big fan of these genres to love this album. so go out and get it! you won't be disappointed at all! ;-)
0066214122|5.0|This book was really good! At first I thought that Julia was having an affair, but boy was I wrong! I'm not going to say anymore because I don't want to give it away but this book was so good! It was a mixture of a mystery and had a lot of sci-fi as well. Michael Crichton at his best!
B00005K3OT|5.0|This was an amazing movie. In one word. Charming. It's a great movie to rent when your not sure what you want but you want it to be good. You get to know the characters in a way that its as if you've lived there your entire live...and Johnny Depp makes for some rather nice eye candy. enjoy.
0385504209|1.0|I don't often buy books, but I bought \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" on the recommendation of more than one good friend. I'll start with the good stuff: Even if not entirely factual, Dan Brown's theories about the female's role in Christianity are intriguing and thought-provoking.<br />However, the book itself, which makes a lame attempt at conveying these theories, is not even remotely intriguing. Brown's writing style is trite, clunky, and a disgrace to what we call modern \\"literature.\\" It took me an unusually long time to get through this book because I kept putting it down after only four or five pages at a time, thinking how incredible it was that such tedious writing could make it through the editorial process. I am equally astounded by the number of people who read this book and who are so quick to call it \\"engaging, thrilling, wonderful, and the best book ever\\" in their reviews. Perhaps in the hands of a more talented author, this book would have been worthwhile. As it stands, though, the [money] I forked over for this could have easily been better spent going to see a couple of mindless and yet much more entertaining movies. This is the WORST BOOK EVER, and if you liked it, well, quite honestly, you make me sad...
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The people in the music business that love George Harrison (I can't imagine anyone who doesn't, except Paul McCartney) really came together and put on a warm, happy, upbeat concert that rang through with George's spirit. The 'Gentle Beatle' was definitely there, and everyone put out their best for him and his family. And his son, Dhani Harrison! It is George reincarnated. What a great son. Clapton's putting it all out on 'My Guitar Gently Weeps', on which he originally played the guitar (you thought that was George, eh?) was spectacular. And Joe Brown's closing Ukulele solo, 'I'll See You in my Dreams', was spectacular for its simplicity and feelings. Even with tons of confetti raining down on the audience, they were silent as church-mice for that one. The strings cut in at the end and blew me away. Thanks to all who made it happen. Even Sir Paul, I guess.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|It's all overworked too complex electronic trip-pop, with some bland hip-hop thrown in. Ugh, the Ying Yang Twins. Britney tries to shock by talking about her sex drive, getting hot and heavy with a guy on the dance floor and about pleasuring herself. But it sounds like a little girl cursing to appall people. It doesn't sound genuine at all. The lyrics are lame, and Spears' voice sounds like a computer recording, she's so synthesized.<br />Britney's just proven that she can't manage real music, and is creating dancepop that isn't even catchy. Want something solid by a former pop starlet? Try Mandy Moore's \\"Coverage.\\" It's classy, beautiful, a good selection of songs and she doesn't try to shock people....
B00018D44U|4.0|Of course the 1st CD was incredible.  This one is really good too, but I am still a little partial to the first.  If you are not a bluegrass or country fan, this CD is not for you.
B00000ILDF|3.0|I actually saw this on opening day when it was first released. I didn't walk out &quot;liking&quot; it, but I certainly admired the mood and craft of the film; certainly much closer to the first film than James Cameron's superior Aliens (I cite Aliens as the absolute best in the series). As an aside, I find Resurrection to be a film that tries to be all three previous films, but, in the end, fails on all levels (I saw it opening day too and walked out as a rather dissapointed fan).<br />So, back to Alien 3. Fincher has since proven his potential, but it's enjoyable to see his early filmic attempts captured in Alien 3. I sympathize with Cameron's anger about what was done to his characters (sorry, the Ripley that turned up on the cover of Time in 1986 IS Cameron's Ripley). So much more could've been explored between the mother/daughter relationship between Ripley and Newt and some great things could've been done romantically with Ripley and Hicks (now, a developed romance would've been a great step forward for the series--yet another example of how the writers screwed the story over). I don't neccessarily disagree with the controversial ending (it's inevitable that it had to go down that way); I just disagree with the rest of the film leading up to it. <br />So, the strengths are:<br />Direction<BR>Production design<BR>Great mood and tone<BR>Sigourney Weaver (as always!)<BR>Great first film from David Fincher<br />The weaknesses:<br />Poor script<BR>Inadequate character development<BR>Too many missed opportunities<BR>The film says little and doesn't successfully move the commentary from the first two forward<br />I recommend this film for sci-fi enthusiasts and fans of the series, but I don't recommend it for people who like to &quot;feel great&quot; after seeing a film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...1 - This may well be the best sci-fi show ever. My wife and I tried to watch it during its initial broadcast airing. It seems like Fox set this up to fail with it irregular airings, episodes out of order and the now infamous, let's not show the pilot that sets up the series until the very last episode. This show deserved so much better than the treatment it received.<P>2 - Could this have been Joss Whedon's best show? The characters were well written, the plots were well thought out, the actors could not have clicked together any better. The CGI effects were awesome (I still get goosebumps watching the \\"Serenity\\" flying through the atmosphere.) <P>3 - Joss Whedon's commentaries are among the best on DVD. Along with Mr. Whedon, four of the nine  actors throw their two cents in and make for entertaining listening.<P>4 - Watching the episodes in order, the way they were meant to be in widescreen and with the bonus of unaired episodes at a very fair price makes for an excellent addition for your collection.<P>5 - The only downer was watching the final disc and getting down to the final two episodes. We knew this was going to be it. No new episodes (for now, one can hope, can't they?), some unanswered questions about the crew and passengers (hopefully they will be answered in \\"Serenity\\" the big screen film in 2005). <P>Finally, there is a hidden easter egg in this release. Insert the fourth disc of the set, at the Main Menu go to \\"Special Features\\". On the second screen, highlight \\"Joss Whedon sings the \\"Firefly\\" theme\\", then press the left arrow key on your remote control. This will highlight an ornament in the background, press \\"Enter\\" and you will get to see Adam Baldwin singing \\"The Hero of Canton.\\"
B000068OSK|5.0|I think this cd is great. It is better than their last two, mainly because it doesn't have as many slow, pastel-ey songs, such as #6, and #7, on Elephant. Infact, I don't know if it has any at all. The less, the better. This album has mostly fast, hard songs, so if that's the side of the white stripes you like best, then this cd will defenitley please you.
B000089RVR|5.0|Took me a while to feel the songs since it's a bit different than No Angel, but I'm totally addicted to it now, especially track 2, &quot;Stoned&quot;.  I often put it on repeat just to hear the mesmerizing beat.  I wish Dido had made a music video for it.  Overall: Highly recommended!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie was nothing like I thought it would be. I thought it was supposed to be funny. What happened to the old Bill Murray? This movie was a waste of my money and time. Not worth it.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I LOVE THIS C.D., WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT  MY FRIEND TOLD ME THAT SHE DID NOT LIKE, NOW I AM THINKING SHE IS CRAZY.  MY FAVORITE TRACKS ON THE C.D. ARE BUMP IT, BACK IN THE DAY, I WANT U, THE GRIND, AND DANGER.  I HAVE ALL OF ERYKAH'S C.D.'S AND THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT AD TO THE COLLECTION, I'M READY FOR ANOTHER ALBUM ALREADY
B00009RDG9|1.0|Have you ever watched a movie where the acting and plot is so cheese that you have to laugh out loud in the theatre in the middle of a serious scene... because it just can't get any dumber???  Well this is one of those kinds of movies, except when you're not laughing, you are snoring.  But I might add, there is suspense... you will be asking yourself \\"When will this senseless movie ever end?\\"<br />Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro fight in the woods camouflaged with their little man-made knives... making ooga-booga grunting noises as they swing away for 10 minutes.  Then they disappear again in the woods for a while to construct another lame knife and do the ooga-booga all-over-again.<br />If you want to laugh at one of the stupidest movies ever made... rent this movie, but by no means buy it.  For those of you with a high-school education and above, I strongly recommend against this movie.... strongly!  And oh yeah, don't be fooled, the one star rating is a negative star!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Unlike some here I'm not surprised that a lot of people don't like this movie. Sofia Coppola puts a challenge in front of us from the very first frame. The shot of Scarlett Johansson's behind encourages you to see her sexually. The rest of the film is about a relationship that's more mature than the feelings that shot awoke in you (particularly for those members of the audience who are annoyed they didn't make out). So many images in the film work like this. They have a meaning that goes beyond their immediate impression.<br />Then, as some have noticed, there's Bob's crooning of \\"More than this, you know there's nothing.\\" At first it just seems like a jokey karaoke moment, but it is the thought in his head. The more times you watch \\"Lost in Translation\\" the more such moments you will see.<br />If you look at Coppola's treatment of the \\"actress\\" in the movie. who - like Keanu Reeves - is entirely insincere about the culture and who thinks she \\"knows\\" kung fu after a most superficial acquantaince, you can see that Coppola is at war with much of the mindless drivel that we get fed by Hollywood. There's a sensibility at work here that is standing against mainstream entertainment. <br />Does that mean this is a manifesto movie? No. But it does mean that it manifests a sensibility you rarely see on the screen. I don't even think of it as an art movie. Just another take on life, of the kind we might see from Louis Malle, or Claude Sautet, or Wim Wenders. It is a sensibility to be cherished by all true movie lovers.<br />Given that Ms. Coppola is set against mainstream commercial superficiality it is not surprising that those who like more mainstream fare hate her film. They should. She is criticising (albeit gently) their mentality. Even if you don't see this consciously, it seeps through. <br />The division between those who love it and those who hate it is sharp.<br />One of the best of 2003. If it speaks to you, and it won't speak to everyone, at least not in a way they'll like, it speaks to you strongly. <br />Ms. Coppola. More please. And kudos to whoever put up the money for this one. You should have done well out of it, and you deserve to.
B0000TLA9G|2.0|The only reason I write this review is because the only existing review bothered me so much that I needed to add to it. I agree that a greatest hits, with no new tracks is unecessary, however at least the tracks are remastered. For the reviewer I dont agree that fans should save their money for Chinese Democracy because I think the greatest hits will be a better buy and have more depth to it. Between Axl's  \\"My World\\", \\"Oh My god\\", and wrecthed live performances I feel he has disgraced the name of the greatest rock band of all time and his album will be simply mediocre considering the amount of time it has taken to create. It seems slightly insecure on his behalf to hide behind the legacy of a name rather than disgrace his own name by putting it on his product. Wake up.<br />I give it two stars because at least someone took the time to run it through some modern day compressors to bring up the level. Not to take anything away from George Marino...
B000069AUI|5.0|Just when you think rock and roll is dead, Coldplay comes out of nowhere and just knocks you off your feet.  At least that is how it happened to me.  I decided to broaden my music tastes and experience other music, I try Coldplay, and it is freaking awesome!  No new band with the exception of Robert Randolph is as good as Coldplay.  They are a breath of desperately needed fresh air.
0743455967|5.0|Definately Stephen King's best Non-fiction book since Danse Macabre! The King gives you an outlook on the life of writing, and also gives you a look on how his writing career took a turn for the good and bad. He talks about what a writer should have, he shines a light on the subject of the importance of reading as a tool. This book is for ANY aspiring authors, or just great fans of the King.
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great by Jim Collins<BR> Book Review by Richard Reisman<br />Jim Collins book Good to Great, describes a 5 year intensive research effort by a group of 20 people led by Collins who investigated the defining criteria of eleven companies which demonstrated \\"good to great\\" growth. This growth was defined as \\"fifteen year cumulative stock returns at or below the general stock market, punctuated by a transition point, then cumulative returns at least three times the market over the next fifteen years\\". The eleven companies found to meet this criteria were Abbott, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly-Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Philip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreen's, and Wells Fargo. Once the eleven companies were picked, a control group of \\"comparison companies\\" was used to help differentiate the characteristics which were responsible for the phenomenal success of the good to great companies and were missing in the \\"comparison companies\\". The comparison companies were either in the same industry as the good to great companies with similar opportunity or were companies which had a brief growth spurt which was not sustained. <BR>Exhaustive research by Collins' team which is nicely summarized in the Appendices elucidated six basic characteristics of the eleven great companies with each of the six elaborately described in individual chapters. The book turned out to be a page turner because of the captivating and inspiring stories told about the people in the companies and the paths that were taken to gain the highest levels of corporate success. As interesting as the stories were, the surprising and unexpected characteristics which were found in, and defined all eleven companies, added to the enjoyment of reading this book.  <BR>The first defining characteristic is \\"Level 5 Leadership\\".  All of the great companies had leaders who were unexpectedly humble yet had a tenacious professional will whose primary concern was the health and growth of the company. This wascompared to the control companies which often had charismatic leaders who make a big splash, looked after their own self interests first and in the end were unable to create sustained growth. The description of Ken Iverson, the dedicated and highly successful Nucor CEO, who still lived in a simple house with a carport and scraped ice off his car windows with a credit card sets the tone of the book which throughout emphasizes the \\"salt of the earth\\" nature of the companies leaders. The description of the control companies CEO's who had a need for self aggrandizement were reminiscent of the Tyco, Enron, Time Warner and WorldCom's CEO's.<BR>The second defining characteristic is entitled \\"first who... then what\\". This is another unexpected finding. The great companies did not formulate a great strategy first as did the control companies. Instead, the CEO's initially spent their energies hiring the best people for the job ahead and firing employees who they did not believe demonstrated the necessary personality traits and work ethic. By and large these employee characteristics consisted of creative people who were self motivated and did not need to be micro managed. This chapter also described three \\"pearls\\" which I believe will be very helpful in my own working life. They are:  1) When in doubt, don't hire- keep looking 2) When you know you need to make a people change, act and 3) Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems. <br />The third defining characteristic is called \\"Confront the Brutal facts\\". A Socratic style evident in all of the great companies is discussed, in which their status during the transition period is very honestly evaluated. This honest appraisal leads to the fourth characteristic named the Hedgehog concept. Simply put, the great companies used three questions to form a simple and direct growth strategy. These questions are: 1) What can we be the best in the world at? 2) What drives our economic engine? And 3) What are we deeply passionate about?  I felt that all three of these questions will be worthwhile asking in my own workplace. <BR>Finally, the last two criteria discussed are entitled \\"A Culture of Discipline\\" and \\"Technology Accelerators\\". These chapters discuss the type of employees in the good to great companies. They reminded me of the type of employees that the One Minute Manager by Blanchard and Johnson described working for their quintessential manager. Most importantly, they were people who with proper guidance did not need to be micromanaged. Furthermore, they were dedicated to and believed the goals of the company. Technology accelerators communicates the concept that the great companies did not become great secondary to the technology they used but rather that companies that are great successfully decide on which technology will best complement the goals dictated by the hedgehog concepts. <BR>Good to Great ends by identifying the concept that the great companies exemplified the old age \\"slow and steady wins the race\\". They did not try and create an overnight turnaround which in the end would have no sustainability but instead religiously followed the necessary path step by step, to make sure their company had a solid foundation with the appropriate employees, goals, attitudes and technology in place.<BR>Good to Great can be criticized for setting such a high standard for the companies they chose. The argument can be made that companies can be great without having astonishing financial growth. With that said, the book describes many management and employee principles that can be well used by any company interested in improving its business.
0451169514|5.0|This story takes you to a place of adventure, terrifying murders, and clowns. Seven children set out to find and kill the beast that has plagued Derry, Maine since the beginning of time. Of course, this won't be easy since it can turn into anything they fear, and can manipulate any other human being to do his bidding. This book is full of action, murders, sex, and child abuse. I recommend this for anyone who likes to be scared.
B000066NW0|5.0|I don't usualy review this crud but since ppl are writing such horriable ones I just thought i'd get the truth out their before ppl take the words of previous reviewers. I love Avril, she may not be punk, but who cares??? Has she every actuly said she was? Nope. The musics great! How can you say you say The Donnas awsome &amp; then call Avril Crap? Somthing reeks poser here &amp; its not Avril, me, or the CD.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|If you like this sort of thing, you'll enjoy the movie.  Even if you have vague, faint sympathy for this sort of thing, lost in translation is worth your while.  If you enjoy clear channel radio stations and Tom Clancy novels... well... um, you can always rent The Fast and the Furious 2 again, I guess.<br />Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen feel lonesome.  Their careers, lovers, and even immediate surroundings feel foreign to them.  That this is set in Tokyo really just underscores the alienation they feel toward their lives in general.  This is made even better by not using Japanese subtitles, when it's spoken so much throughout the movie.  Also, discounting Bill and Scarlett's chars, every single American in the movie are deplorable phonies, and they stick out even moreso in the sea of Japanese.<br />Sofia has documented alienation in its purest form, then swept it away with sweet love.  That's really the point of the movie, and if you've never experienced anything like that, you'll likely think Lost is pointless.  Oh well.
B000002NIW|2.0|I still havent listened to this whole cd... because it all sounds the same and the songs arent that great.. My Own Summer is the best song on the cd, and probably the best song they've ever made.. other than that I think the Cd is alright... not worth getting excited over it
0790729652|4.0|When this movie was released in 1989 it was the most successful movie that year and rightly so. Everything about it is truly fantastic. Tim Burton's vision of the film remains true to the original DC comics, he keeps it realistic by making Gotham city dark and brooding and this in my opinion is still his best film to date.<br />When Michael Keaton was chosen to portray Batman it did cause a lot of concearn as the audience didn't think he would be able to pull it off. But Michael Keaton is just superb in the title role he captures the realism of Bruce Wayne and Batman perfectly and he is still the best actor to play batman to date. Val kilmer and George Clooney aren't a patch on Keaton. Jack Nicholson is also fantastic as the Joker his villainy and hillarious wickedness makes every scene that he is in a joy to watch, yet again he proves just how good an actor he is. Joker is the best villain in the series still because Schwarzenegger as Mr freeze is just embarassing.<br />Kim Basinger is the love interest of Batman and she does well in the role, Michael Gough is also very good as Alfred.<br />The art direction of the movie won an oscar and it deserved it because of the vision of Gotham city well done Anto Furst. Danny Elfman's music score is so good because it suits the film remarkably well. The score is one of the best ever believe me i have the CD and i listen to it practicly every week!<br />This film stands out still as the best one in the series. This film is a masterpiece in my opinion worth watching just for Keaton and Nicholsons performance alone. I have only given the DVD 4 stars becuse there is no special features except production notes. If i were you i would wait for the special edition version next year but if you still want to buy this version be my guest you won't be dissapointed with the film I gurantee it!..
B000002UAU|5.0|There really isn't much more to say about this album. The songs are familiar, almost archetypes, to more than a few generations. It just keeps being reborn and recelebrated. When the CD was finally released (up until the late 1980s the Beatles were still only available on vinyl, regardless that nearly every other major band had made it to CD - apparently Apple lawsuits had some part to play in this) the hype may have even overshadowed the album's original release. This album frequently takes the number one spot on \\"best albums of all time\\" lists, and by many is regarded as the Beatles' crowning achievement (which is quite a statement considering the Beatles' amazing output). It also reached beyond music, having an influence on fashion and design. This is all well-established and nearly uncontroversial as the Beatles slowly fade their way from the mainstream to legend.<br />So what more can be said about this album? This: the unlikelihood of something like Sgt. Pepper happening in today's music culture. Music has always been a business, and risks still were risks even back in what many consider \\"the good 'ol days\\". Nonetheless, music these days is a huge money maker, and money makers hold the reins of today's music culture. Back in 1967, the Beatles were more than well established (despite their retirement from touring), and so well placed to take more risks than the average band with one top 40 hit in their pocket. Record company management in 1967 probably thought that the Beatles could do anything and not fail; so nothing that the Beatles released was seen as a huge risk (this is probably why the movie \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" was allowed to exist). In this way, Sgt. Pepper is the fruit of the Beatles' success and a testament to their strength as one of rock and pop's greatest bands yet. It may be fair to say, but a bit controversial, that only the Beatles could have pulled something like this off. It's also probably not an overstatement to say that Sgt.Pepper is a one-time event in the history of pop and rock music. There are not many of those.<br />Can anyone see Madonna, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, or Linkin Park getting away with releasing a modern day equivalent to Sgt. Pepper? It would be too big of a risk since record companies prefer to capitalize on a band \\"as they are\\" and dump them when the interest wanes. Not to mention that few bands are allowed to exist long enough to develop into the kind of musical phenomenon that the Beatles became. I hope I'm wrong on this one, but the evidence doesn't present much opportunity for optimism.<br />Sgt.

6305014140|5.0|Hey guys.  The best anime film I've seen, EVER.  To start, this has the coolest villian you couldn't ever imagine.  He was not the main villian in the movie but, a character like Tessai is what every good anime creator should base their main villian on.  He is the ideal badass.  Though he is my favorite character in the movie, I feel that there was one other person that did not get the credit that he deserved.  I think the best fighter in the feature is the Blind Swordsman in white who issues a challenge to Jubei.  It has been a while since I've seen the film so I can't remember the guy's name.  I feel that had it not been for the girl ninja, Kigaro, he would still be alive today.  Anyone who has seen the film can't deny these facts.  In every perspective that I've viewed it, the film is artistically excellent and beautifully written.  11 out of 10 stars, esily.  If you havn't seen this movie, it should not be ignored and should be an item on every collectors list.  If anyone else feels me on this, holla back!

The movie isn't even scary. The movie takes place in one place the whole movie. In a deserted shopping mall. Trust me dont even rent this movie. It sucks. <BR>-The Movie Guy
B00018D3RI|5.0|Answer:  Blue.  Question:  The color of their eyes.  This remarkable series is finally available on DVD, uncut with detail to die for.  Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul's on-screen chemistry is a rarity to behold.  My life would have been complete if it included an audio commentary over episodes by the actors.  If you like screetching Torinos, creepy-looking bad guys and 70s action, it has it all.  But we all know what separates this series from the rest; the friendship.
B00006AW2M|1.0|This albums is nothing more than a pathetic, trite, contrived stab at a genre this band has no business exploring.  I always had my suspicions, but good listen to this album confirms: they are only in it for the money!  Don't spend your time or money on this one. Try Some Girls if you want some decent songwriting.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Have you ever tried to go full throttle with a bike not being scared by the idea of crash into the first wall? Going full throttle for the only sake of feeling the highest speed you can reach, the blood running through your veins and your brain pumping the adrenaline? This album gives me this kind of fantastic emotion. Energy, pure energy, speed, brutality without compromises, without the limits that everyday world put in front of you again and again. This is something that a lot of people don't comprehend when they judge this album as repetitive or boring or stupid. This album is incredible adrenalinic and that's it. No more, no less. I treasure it since I bought in 1986, almost twenty year ago (and REALLY I  listen usually to very different kinds of music!!!). It is pure energy, with a lot of unforgettable riffs. Pure gold. Who cares about satan anyway? That's [nonsense]. The music is what's important here. A brutal, fast, terrifying music. To me this album is unique.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" looks like it is going to be another one of those totally predictable films that I have been watching for the past couple of weeks.  After all, Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) has arrived from U.C.L.A. all excited about teaching art history at Wellesley College in the fall of 1953.  After all, Wellesley has the brightest women in the country (by its own admission).  But as soon as she puts up the first slide in class Katharine finds that her class is totally prepared for her.  After all, she is not only from California, which is certainly bad enough, she is unmarried, which is even worse.  When her students recognize every single slide in her first lecture Katharine is seriously rattled, but she has a saving grace in that even if she is an unmarried first time teacher from California, she happens to like modern art.<br /><br />Now, I was a bit worried about this film at that point because if students already know everything in the textbook then you just take the class to the next level.  This is essentially what Katharine does, but it takes her a while to figure it out.  Of course, modern art is not part of the proscribed curriculum, which means Katharine has just started to buck the system.  Will Katharine, who came to teach tomorrow's leaders and not their wives, be able to save the minds if not the souls of her students or will the system come down on her like the wrath of outraged alumni?  We have seen this before (\\"Dead Poet Society\\" is the obvious point of reference), but not with Julie Roberts and not with a cast of already established young female talent (as opposed to the traditional unknown males).<br /><br />Four of Katharine's students matter in different ways.  Betty Warren (Kirsten Dunst) is at Wellesley to become the perfect wife, just like her mother (who is a trustee), and anybody who does not fit her prim and proper model gets to be denounced in an editorial in the school paper.  Anything Katharine does that Betty does not like is de facto \\"subversive.\\"  Joan Bradwyn (Julia Stiles) is the smartest girl in the class and would be interested in going to law school (at Yale no less) if not for the fact that she is planning on become a wife and mother.  Giselle Levy (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is the promiscuous one, at least when it comes to older men.  Constance Baker (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the one who can only dream of actually having a guy pay attention to her some day.<br /><br />The idea is that Katharine is a proto-feminist, which is only a radical idea because apparently Wellesley educates young women for no reason.  Supposedly Yale keeps one of its five spots for women open for a Wellesley graduate, but anybody who wants the place to be more than the most expensive finishing school in the country is obviously \\"subversive,\\" so who would ever take advantage of it?  When Katharine gets Joan to fill out the Yale application Betty is frothing at the mouth, sputtering with rage that her best friend would actually use her brain and abandon the goal of being the perfect wife.  Although it makes no sense to me, Betty gets married during her senior year, disappearing for five weeks to go on her honeymoon and set up her household before returning to class to go back to butting heads with Katharine and the other girls in the group, who are obviously been inspired by the radical teacher to think independently.<br /><br />What redeems \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" is that there are a couple of key moments that do not go the way that you think.  At one point you are going to be thinking that a suicide is imminent, but instead there is a moment of affirmation and boldness that was a nice surprise.  Then there comes the moment when Betty is about to get her comeuppance.  It seems that Betty's husband might be married but does not care enough about his \\"perfect\\" wife to stay faithful to her.  But just as you are all ready to enjoy Betty having her wretched life thrown back in her face, screenwriters Lawrence Konner and MarkRosenthal go in a different direction.  Roberts has some nice moments when she makes her anger work for her, Dunst gets to be the heavy, and Goodwin shines as the young woman who discovers happiness might actually be within her grasp.<br /><br />Whether or not \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" has a happy ending depends on whether you think battles or wars are what need to be won.  Katharine has some relationship issues with a couple of guys, but that is just a sideshow.  What matters here is what happens between the teacher and her students.  Director Mike Newell's film also works because it uses art history to great effect, not only as Katharine confronts her students with examples of modern art but as they find a fitting way of having their teacher remember them and understand that she did make a difference.  This is not a great film, but it is a good film at a time when there are very few of those around.irection.

0061015725|5.0|Something that I have always admired about Crichton's work is how easily he can make readers understand technical things. Albeit this novel is science fiction, Crichton nevertheless used real sources for backing in his scientific technicalities, and he explained it to readers in a way that they could understand, especially to readers who have no idea what nanotechnology is. Yet, it seems that Crichton used everyday family life to connect to his readers, because the main character is a stay at home dad, something some of us can actually relate to. Crichton continued to enthrall the reader by making the novel very exciting, and I found that I was extremely interested in this novel from start to finish. I recommend this book for any sci-fi fan.

B000021YQV|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I have in my collection.  There is beautiful singing by Serj, awesome guitar playing by daron, killer bass by shavo, and the best damn drumming dy john.  I'll give u a rundown on the tracks:<BR>1. Prison Song--10/10--very killer intro song.  Great way to open a cd by yelling &quot;THERE TRYING TO BUILD A PRISON!!&quot;<BR>2. Needles--10/10--Very Clever Song.  Again, the lyrics capture the listner.<BR>3. Deer Dance--8/10--An O.K. song but has nice lyrics(which relate to me in a way)<BR>4. Jet Pilot--9/10--just like my rating, almost good.<BR>5. X--12/10--I, to this day, have not found anything this kick ass.  Nothing beats the insanely heavy chords Daron beats out of his guitar, and john beating the $#!% out of his cymbals.<BR>6. Chop Suey--12/10--SOAD's crowning achievment.  This is the song that got the band really recognized.<BR>7. Bounce--8.5/10--Honestly, one I skip by often, but it is a good listening to if you are in the right mood.<BR>8. Forest--10/10--One of the best in my opinion.  It has a really headbanging chorus, and a really neat bridge.<BR>9. ATWA--10/10--ATWA standa for Air, Trees, Water, Air.  This song is very powerful.  It is a song about Charles Manson.  Not his killing, but how he might have seen the world.<BR>10. Science--9/10--...............Ehhhhh.  An O.K. song but nice lyrics.<BR>11. Shimmy--11/10--Makes me laugh.  It is a really cool song to listen to, and if you look up the words in the dictionary, you might than understand what he is saying(I know I did!)<BR>12. Toxicity--12/10--A very good choice to name an album after<BR>13 Psycho--10/10--When I first bought the cd, I didn't like the song because of the techno beginning.  When I listened to it whole, I was Amazed.<BR>14. Aerials--15/10--Spellbinding.  SOAD always makes kick ass outro songs.  This is a work of art, poetry, and craft.  This is their best song out of every one they have made.  Listen to this first and you will be come instantly hooked.<BR>    I hope you will buy this cd.  You can't stop listening to it once you do.

B00008H2LB|2.0|I think it is rather safe to say that LP has officially gone to pot. Most of the songs on this album sound the same. How heavy metal is that? I mean, there are no guitar solos, mostly synthetic drumming, and rap! Trust me, rap and rock do not mix.<BR> About a year ago I borrowed Hybrid Theory from a friend with very low expectations. However, I was completely blown away! It was excellent. This is just sad. Do yourself a favor and listen to Hybrid Theory instead. Or listen to some other good bands (e.g. Foo Fighters, Green Day, Fountains of Wayne, Trapt, or  Yellowcard). Steer away from this poor excuse for an album. I will give it this though, Don't Stay, Faint, Breaking the Habit, and Numb are all pretty good songs. The rest are just pathetic.

I feel like he could have packed all of his books into 1 strait froward book with no fuff and no loose ends that say, &quot;if you want to know more about real estate investing purchase my book [insert title]&quot;.  I also checked out the website  [...] and found the game they were avertising in the book to be $195!  $195 for a board game!  come on!  I expected to pay about $20.
0800177975|4.0|In this movie Arnold Schwarzenegger does something that is rarely seen by him, comedy. To see him in a comedic fashion parallels to Jackie Chan doing comedy in the Rush Hour movies. The movie goes at a slow, but decent pace. It is filled with tons of action, humor and of course one liners. It is interesting to see the movie, then play the pinball game. It helped to pull out quotes and actions. If you love action and comedies or just &quot;The Governator,&quot; get this movie.
B000000W5F|4.0|Tattoo You proved the stones could still write and play good music.  This album showed the stones playing a variety of styles.  The first side is very solid.  'Slave' is a bit grating, but the other songs make for great listening.  On side two, 'Worried About You' is a neat soul number with Mick using his falsetto voice.  'Waiting On A friend' is an underrated tune that has Mick showing a softer side of himself and some sax work by the great Sonny Rollins.  I think it stands up alot better than other Stones albums from the eighties.    Emotional Rescue, Undercover, Dirty Work, and Steel Wheels (to a lesser degree) pale in comparison to Tattoo You.  They aren't complete disasters, but it's easy to separate the few gems from the filler.  Yes, I know Tattoo You is comprised mostly of material not used (or perfected) on previous albums.  That's what impresses me about this album.  The songs were taken from various recording sessions and in some cases completely overhauled (Start  Me Up originally had a reggae beat!).  It resulted in an album  that's still a pleasure to listen to 23 years later.  Is it a classic stones album? Well, it's no Exile On Main Street, but if you want to hear a very good sounding stones album from the early eighties, Tattoo You is the one to get.
0375713751|1.0|I am a working mother and I found this book to be outrageous and offensive beyond all measure.  Not only was the heroine possibly the most heinous mother imaginable (every horrible stereotype about a woman who likes her career and has no business being a mother at all magnified by 3000), but the moral of this awful book is that even a heinous horrible mother is better served being home with her kids.  That this book is touted aS a comedy novel for working mothers is outrageous and I'm sorry I wasted my time (thankfully not money) reading it.  Working mothers beware -- DO NOT READ THIS HORRIBLE TRASH!

And who ever has seen it needs to see it again. i would recomend this to anyone who hasnt seen it. you wont be sorry. it is GOOD. thank you for you time.       sincerly,    tiffany lee
B0001AP12G|2.0|Am i the only person who thinks this album is weak he has the weakest flow and is lame when riding the beat. He is like a cheap Talib Kweli with an even worse flow. The album has well too many interludes and they are all pointless. Its annoying because he is about to blow and his rapping abilities dont credit him blowin. The lyrics are good but are nothing that other rappers like dead prez etc have done for years now
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Don't be fooled, this isn't a great movie, certainly NOT A MASTERPIECE as many will have you to believe.  Both of the leads give nice performances and the film does capture the mood of being an expatriate in a foreign land.  BUT, this film is terribly naive and unfocused.  It's incredible that Coppola got an oscar for this film, which I'm pretty sure, didn't have a script at all (at least not a script worth awarding).  There's a moment about halfway in where the leads are on a bed, and talking about the problems with life, and if it's not a failure to the actors then I don't know what is.  It's one of those instances where something great could happen if only the writer had given them something to say.  The film is filled with such moments.  Also, the depiction of Japanese people is cartoonish and stereotypical.  I was sure Bruce Lee was going to pop out of a closet at some point.  Now, you'd argue that the Japanese were seen through the vantage of the Westerners, hence the stereotypes, but that just doesn't cut it.  It's akin to an Eastern filmmaker doing a film in America where everyone talks with a midwestern accent, likes to eat, and has no knowledge nor concern of the rest of the world.  It wouldn't fly just as it does with LIT.  THe film is too slow to be completely Hollywood fodder, yet pretentious enough to qualify as an &quot;Art Film&quot;.  But don't be fooled, this film is neither the former or the latter.  It's a confused, naive, so-so film.  And any comparisons to Antonioni or Kar-Wai are laughable...those men were/are real artists, Sophia Coppola is still trying to find her voice.  Any comparisons to IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE are like comparing the show FRIENDS to ALL ABOUT EVE: not even breathing the same air.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|How could anyone rate this disc anything other than a 5. A 2 1/2.<BR>Give me a break. Yeah, it doesnt have Estranged. Im mad too, but still this is one of the greatest rock bands ever and this is all of it in one cd. So what if Axl is doing his thing and some people think it sucks. This is the \\"greatest hits\\" of a great band. 2 and a half stars. If you dont like the band dont buy the disc!
B000006OS2|2.0|The new Paramount edition is what we've been waiting for. Great escapist fun and best of all, the picture is gorgeous. If you're a John Wayne/McLintock fan you will love this edition and wonder why it took them so long to release it. My only comment is that the Introduction plays everytime you view the video, but its very interesting and can be skipped easily. I'm also glad there are plenty of extras on this disc. As far as the film the high point for me is the sense that the actors are really enjoying themselves. Bravo.      Prior Version about Goodtimes Video    As others have stated this is an extremely terrible copy. I actually spent most of my time trying to figure out why it looks so bad. Why are some of the scenes good looking and others just awful. The telencine was very poorly done and not consistent. How did this happen? Was this a first try that was abandoned? Was the pan-and-scan an early version that had not quite worked out the details. I'm really curious about how this \\"version\\" which is poor, edited, and blurry able to be released and sold here and at stores like Walmart.  I also noticed that the packaging mentiones it as an \\"unauthorized\\" edition.    I love John Wayne films, particularly with Mrs. Ohara and would hope a real DVD edition comes out.    Still the great story line makes the film worth watching, even if the stereotypical attitude towards the Comanche is a bit dated.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I finally listened -- really listened -- to John Mayer's CD ROOM FOR SQUARES, after loving the song No Such Thing on the radio for years.  The album has now joined my short list of all-time favorites. It is filled with great melodies, and fresh, introspective, youthful lyrics -- the songs 3X5 and Love Song For No One are two of the most wonderful.  It's no surprise Mr. Mayer has continued on his successful journey since this album appeared in 2001.  You will love it.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Besides being a great production of Hamlet, I saw hints of a whole new interpretation of the play.  Hamlet looks exactly like his uncle, but nothing like his father, suggesting that his mother and uncle have been fooling around for a long time.  For the first time this gives Hamlet an excellent reason to wimp out on avenging his father's death.  I always thought he should just either kill Claudius or not and stop whining about how miserable he was.  This way, he has a genuine dilemma: if he kills his \\"uncle\\" to avenge his \\"father\\", he will really be killing his biological father.  The \\"To be or not to be\\" speech in front of the mirror was brilliant, and tied in the idea that if he kills Claudius, he is in a way killing himself,too.<BR>Ophelia is also more interesting in this version.  There is some implication that since she is no longer a virgin, or possibly even pregnant, Hamlet's dumping her and her father's death leaves her without any protectors.  She has good reason to lose her grip and kill herself.<BR>All in all, this was a fascinating version of Hamlet.  The ending was a little much for me, but the rest of it opened up so much interesting new territory that it is easy to forgive that.<BR>I can't wait for the DVD!
B00008PW2D|4.0|The fifth season was a little short compared to season 2, 3 and 4.  They could have made a few more shows in my opinion it was not as good as the previous seasons, but I am a fan and chose to buy this season anyway.  It could have been a little more interesting, but since Sarah was pregnant maybe this limited the writing and the shortness of the season.  Still a fan mo matter what.

B0001IN0DA|5.0|With all the hype for Wrestlemania XX at MSG, I knew it was very difficult from the begining to to live up to the hype.  I can't say it was the best Wrestlemania ever, but far from the worst, and improving from Wrstlemania XIX the previous year.<br />John Cena Vs. Big Show - Ends up being an entertaining match, it could have been longer though.  The ending went well, as Cena became the new U.S. champ to jump-start the crowd on the right foot. I personally would have liked Big how winning, cause I thought he gave the better effort.  Solid match overall. <br />Chris Jericho Vs. Christian - Not as good as the two men are capable of being, but had some nice moves to it.  The ending was kind of funny.  Not a great but fun match.<br />Booker T & RVD Vs. The Dudley Boys Vs. La Resistance Vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade - Not a whole lot of exitement in this match, there was nice moves here and there, with Booker & RVD doing most of the work and end up retaining their World Tag Titles<br />Randy Orton, Ric Flair and Batista AKA Evolution Vs. The Rock and Mick Foley AKA Rock N' Sock Connection-  Well entertaing for the most part, Flair is a legend but really should retire, Foley and Rock are not what they once were.  Had some great moves, and the ending could have been better.  But still a nice watch.<br />Evening Gown Match- Sable & Torrie Wilson Vs. Jackie Gayda & Stacy Keibler - Strictly for the men who seemed to have loved it, forget the fighting, it was not special in this mactch.<br />10-Man Cruiserweight Championship - Overall not fun, brutal to watch some pinfalls.  With Chavo Guerrero retaing his title.<br />Goldberg Vs. Brock Lesnar and Stone Cold Steve Austin as special guest referee-  Why did I know this match would be the most critisized out of all of them.  The Hype was definetily there.  I am hearing people say it was the worst match they have ever seen, Yeah Right!  Seeing Brock getting Spheread<BR>and Jackhammered and Goldberg getting F-5'd was fun to see.The problem though is that it had a 5 minute stare-down before the fighting even began.  Kind of slow, and both men were testing each others power rather than doing more wrestling moves on each other.  It should have invlved more physical wrestling for it's macth length.  It was said to be the last match for both Goldberg and Lesnar going in to the match, as the Crowd was yelling at Lesnar, saying he was a sellout, and people were even chanting Goldberg sucks, The Crowd was even rooting for Austin more than thos e two. It was like they wanted Austin to wrestle in the match in a three-way, not that there would have been anything wrong with that, but Austin gave the Fans what they wanted by stunning both men, Austin is just the man.<br />Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi Vs. APA Vs. basham brothers Vs. The Self-proclaimed World's greatest Tag Team - I thought it was a goos effort by all men, Not that Great but Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty retained their Tag Titles.<br />Victoria Vs. Molly Holly-  Not exactly excellent, but had some very good moves with Victoria coming out on top.  Molly Holly ends up getting her haed shaved bald by Victoria, due to the match stipulation. Funny moment.<br />Kurt Angle Vs. Eddie Guerrero-  Not a classic but still very entertaining,  Had some nice high-flying action, Very good ending. Both men worked hard, but the better person won, as Eddie Gurrero retained his Undisputed Championship.<br />Undertaker Vs. Kane- Nostalgia all the way.  Like these two havn't face off before.  The main story-line here was Undertaking returning back as his dead-man form bringing paul berrer with him.  Match could have been longer, but everything you could have expected between the two big man, As the Undertaker came out victorious improving his Wrestlemania record t0 12-0.<br />Shawn Michaels Vs. Triple H Vs. Chris Benoit- Great macth for being the last one.  Entertaining the entire time, with blood all over the place.  All men just gave a great effort, as Chris Benoit acheived hid lofe-long goal by becoming the World Heavy-Weight Champion, which was well deserved by the crippler.<br />Overall, probrably not the best Wrestlemania, but had just enough to live up to the hype, when the DVD hits stores, I will ceratainly buy it, unlike I did for last year's Wrestlemania XIX.  Wrestlemania XX for the most part was pure fun.
B00009W0WM|4.0|Casablanca is unsurpassed as a movie and having it on DVD is well worth while.  On the special following the movie, I found the monologue, over the film to be very distracting.  Here, the film is rerun from beginning to end while a narration over it has very little to do with what is happening on screen.  It would have been much better if the narration simply explained or amplified what was happening on screen.  An even better alternative would have been to create an explanitory narrative (or use the existing one) but to cut and splice the film to match what was being said.  The specials on the other disk, by Loren Bacal, were good.  The cartoon bit, rather poor.<BR>carrollflys,<BR>california
B0001IN0DA|3.0|So here is my review of wrestlemania 20....<br />To be honest i was dissapointed. Don't get me wrong the matches were pretty good but since it was wrestlemania i tought it would be amazing. here are my opinions of the matches...<br />John Cena VS the Big Show (United States Championship) - 7.5/10<BR>this match was nothing special. had good spots like when cena lifted the big show over his head.<br />Booker T & RVD VS the Dudley Boyz VS La Resistance VS Mark Jindrak & Garrison Cade (World Tag Team Championship) - 7.5/10<BR>again nothing special, best spot was rvd's five star frog splash.<br />Christian VS Chris Jericho - 7/10<BR>match was a bit dissapointing, kind of a match you would see on television not wrestlemania. has an ending you wont believe!<br />Evolution VS Rock 'n' Sock Connection - 9.5/10<BR>Definately the match i was waiting for! this felt like a wrestlemania match and mick foley put on a great performance. nothing very hardcore but the match had some great spots.<br />Torrie Wilson & Sable VS Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie - 3/10<BR>This was a waste of time to be honest, deserves 3 just because it was a playboy evening gown match.<br />The Cruiserweight Open (Cruiserweight Championship) - 9/10<BR>This match was kinda short but was very good. some amazing action from the cruiserweights and billy kidman had some great spots.<br />Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar - 2/10<BR>The worst match of the night and the worst match i've seen in a long time. this match deserved the BORING chants it got from the crowd and i gave it 2 because of austin's stunner on lesnar.<br />Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi VS the Basham Brothers VS APA VS the Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Team Championship) - 6.5/10<BR>I didnt like the idea of two 4 way tag team matches in one night and this one was dissapointing. the 1st one was way better and this had no good spots. an average smackdown match.<br />Victoria VS Molly Holly (Women's Championship) - 4/10<BR>Basically your averagewomens match, pretty boring. <br />Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle (WWE Championship) - 8/10<BR>This was pretty good match.nothing amazing but still good.<br />Undertaker VS Kane - 7/10<BR>To be honest i expected more out of the match, the match was pretty dissapointing but undertaker's return was amazing. the atmosphere in the crowd was great and i gave this 7 because of his return.<br />Chris Benoit VS Triple H VS Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Championship) - 10/10<BR>like the rock and sock match, this match lived up to its hype. definately felt like a wrestlemania main event and had alot of good spots like the announce table and shawn michael's many sweet chin music's. great match.<br />Overall i would not recommend you to purchase the dvd. it was an ok ppv and a dissapointing wrestlemania. Also i felt that the ppv wasn't hardcore enough or there was no gimmick matches like ladder, table, cage etc.. pratically every match was just a plain singles match and there was no weapons used in the whole ppv. Best Spot = Billy Kidman's shooting star. Best match = Chris Benoit VS Triple H VS Shawn Michaels, Best Performance = Mick Foley
B00006879E|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; on the radio, I thought that it was the most intriguing song that I've ever listened to in a long time.  With the subsequent release of the catchy tune &quot;This Love&quot;, I just had to get this CD. All the songs on this CD are standouts. From soulful ballads such as &quot;She Will Be Loved&quot; and &quot;Sweetest Goodbye&quot; to funky rythmic songs such as &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Tangled&quot;.  Each song has its own unique sound with awesome guitar riffs, beats, and of course vocals led by Adam Levine. Their blend of soulful r&amp;b and rock, tight harmonies and funky beat, will have you dancing and singing the whole day through.<BR>I just had the pleasure to see them in a live performance hosted by a local radio station, and they are utterly amazing! They are full of so much energy!  <BR>So, for those of you who are seeking for something different than mainstream pop, this CD is for you. Go ahead and try it!
0688163173|1.0|I was very dissapointed in Shutter Island, my first Lehane novel.  The writing style was interesting but the story was cliche after contrivance with confusion thrown in for good measure.  And what was that ending?  It lost me completely and made me feel that my time spent on the book was wasted.  If it hadn't been a library book I would have left it on the plane.  And I won't be reading another Lehane any time soon.
0385504209|5.0|In &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; Dan Brown borrows from and liberally interprets historical events to create a thriller that makes the reader think.  In many novels, there comes a point where you can pinpoint the final outcome, but in this novel, Dan Brown has create a series of twists and turns that keep the reader guessing at what is going to happen next and what the outcome is going to be.<br />While keeping the readers guessing about what is going to happen in the text, Brown has also created a novel that can make you think about how events and people in the past have affected our lives today.  While this book doesn't answer the question, &quot;Why should I study history?&quot; (which I don't believe is the intent of the novel) it does provide some areas of question that makes the reader want to find out more about some aspects of history, that might or might not have been glossed over to promote a specific point of view.<br />By far, in terms of new novels I have read lately, this is one of the most fun that has also made me think.  The style of writing is not an academic style of writing, but it is also not written down to the level of the non educated either.  It is a well written novel that you can read for fun or to really make the wheels of your mind turn.
1572814349|5.0|Everything about this deck is 5 star. I can only mirror Gita's feelings on the craftmanship and quality. And not just a pretty face this deck reads beautifully. I have a large collection and many sit on the shelf from lack of readability this deck I will USE. Kat Black's deck is true to Rider Waite interpretation and is an &quot;Accurate Read&quot; straight out of it's beautiful box.<BR>The golden guilding, the beautiful art work, and the truly useful little &quot;big&quot; book that comes packed in the sturdy lift top box is a work of art. Kat has done herself proud and so has US Games. The price is amazing. I don't think anyone could go wrong ordering this deck. I highly, highly recomend it.<BR>It is fast becoming my favorite deck.
B000068PQ0|5.0|And so it begins.  <br />I had never listened to a Flaming Lips album before, but I kept seeing &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; on some of last years &quot;best albums&quot; lists, so I thought I'd take a chance and check it out.  It took about three listens before I was hooked on this cd.  I can't help smiling when I listen to it, and I listen to it at work, while I'm driving, and at home.  While not usually a fan of the concept-album per-se, this one has really stuck to me.  It has a hint of Pink Floyd, with almost dreamy, ethereal, qualities.  It is full of some wonderful bass lines, creative percussion, and thoughtful lyrics.  My favorite songs are &quot;Flight Test&quot;, &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1&quot;, &quot;Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell&quot;, and &quot;Are you a Hypnotist&quot;, but &quot;Do You Realize&quot; is my stand-out favorite, just a beautiful song, and it sickens me to now hear it on a television car commercial.  <br />If you have eclectic tastes in music, and don't limit yourself to pop radio, I think you will enjoy &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;.
0385504209|5.0|Wonderful from beginning to end. Not only a good story, but I learned a lot of fascinating things. The other critics are no doubt right that Brown stretches some truths to make the novel work but...Altogether I thoroughly enjoyed it and I recommend it highly.<br />I'm going to the store to buy Brown's other books.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|I enjoyed this album, but I am tired of having Iron Maiden followers saying that this cd is the best ever, it's simply not.  The songs have a tendency to be VERY repetitive.  Also they have some songs that just arn't really good also they don't have any great solo's in this album either.<br />The Great Songs<BR>The Wickerman, Ghost of the Navigator, Blood Brothers, Dream of Mirrors, Fallen Angel.<br />The good songs<BR>Mercenary, Brave New World.<br />Not too good songs<BR>Nomad, Out of the Silent Planet, Thin Line Between Love and Hate.<br />Hope this helps
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Romance in Hollywood? Have 'em meet cute.&quot; So said one old Hollywood scriptwriter. And it's an idea that turns up with sickening regularity in romantic comedies. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a romance (kind of) and a comedy (kind of) where the romance is more genuine than that and the humor is more natural than we usually get in the mainstream. <br />It's always dangerous when excessive adulation is built up by the media, but for me &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; overcomes that. Despite the over-reaction, this is not a cure for cancer. Nor did it ever pretend to be. Blame the media for the rest.<br />It's a sweet, sad, gentle, sometimes sardonic movie. It shows an odd side of Tokyo (where I worked for three years) yet it shows a side that IS there. The karaoke scene was hilariously true to life. Watch Japanese kids coming on like kids from the L.A. &quot;hood&quot; for an even bigger laugh. The last place in the world I'd expected to be called &quot;Homey&quot; with pointed finger gestures was Tokyo.<br />Only one scene, with the Japanese-speaking doctor, didn't quite ring true. Someone would have made an effort to translate. But it isn't an objective documentary on Tokyo. It's about how Tokyo feels to two jet-lagged, insomniac slightly lost individuals who fall - at least a little - in love. For them, as for us, consciousness selects what we experience. Look at the theme of windows in the movie. Seeing but cut off from the world around.<br />It's fine to watch on DVD, even better on a big screen. But watch it closely. Just note how the things they experience reflect on their own lives - a Japanese wedding, impenetrable to Charlotte as any marriage might be to an outsider. Neither of these characters pretends to a closeness with the culture they do not possess. <br />Finally, all I really have to say is that it moved me. A lot. The last words we don't hear. A perfect Zen koan. Bob and Charlotte deserve a little privacy, and deserve something that is between them and only between them
B0001AP12G|5.0|It took me about five times to listen to Kanye's album to fully appreciate it.  After listening so long to maintstream hip hop artists who mostly rap about the same things, it was difficult for me to get into his album.  However, Kanye is blessed and although I am a college graduate, I can relate to several of his songs and interludes.  Kanye, Keep It Rollin'
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is an interesting one.  I think it is the type of film you either get a feel for or you don't.  And that's okay.  Certainly not as miraculous or profound as some think, it's a wispy daydream carried by a quiet, little story, an etheral soundtrack and an ending that leaves you with, &quot;what did he say?&quot; The performances are consistently great in this fish-out-of-water romance. Did it deserve all the attention? Perhaps.  But maybe it's just that we need more of this type of film in our drama-, effects-heavy world.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This film left me wondering whether I needed a hearing aid.  But I think the scene in question involved deliberate, sly ambiguity - already something clever for the viewer to appreciate.  The film was a little slow moving (but only if your aesthetic sensibilities are principally shaped by video games), a little understated and, in short, it was a gem.  The DVD contains \\"deleted scenes.\\"  Of those deleted scenes, I wished the one titled \\"Charlotte and robots\\" had not been deleted.  Film buffs who enjoy finding cinematic allusions to earlier films should find allusions to \\"The Third Man\\" and to \\"Betelgeuse,\\" as well as others which I failed to notice.
B00008PW2D|5.0|I like the zillions of others across the world am a huge fan of Sex and The City. Not having HBO, I discovered the series through word of mouth and then via rentals at the video store. Season 5 was short but sweet and with the pregnancies of both Cynthia Nixon and Sarah Jessica Parker, was there much more that the producers could do than offer up eight episodes?! What if they had decided no season at all? God we'd have all been in mini therapy groups! So let's not complain and take what we can get girls cuz eight episodes were better than nothing! WHERE MY CHIEF COMPLAINT does come in is the exorbitantly high price of the DVD set. Come on HBO lighten up a bit! Two discs with only four episodes on each can surely be priced @ $15-$20 tops! As for me,since I've rented season five on DVD, I'll wait until the passing of time and the eventual lower price I'll find in a used copy.
B00007LTIB|5.0|I noticed he would've given a Bartok Concerto 5 stars &quot;were it not for one flaw - the haunting woodwind theme in the second movement of Concerto #1 is too soft.&quot;<br />A word of advice, Mr. Richman.<br />Go out, drink, get laid, do something man.  You don't want to be an uptight cheapskate the rest of your life, do you?<br />THIS IS MY ALL TIME-FAVE, AS FAR AS YES ALBUMS GO.  I think that Gates Of Delirium is one of the finest ever penned by Yes, and I even enjoy the keyboard work of the GREAT PATRICK MORAZ, since it all went to his head after this album.<br />Sound Chaser, yes, is wierd.  I think it's after your 50th listen that this track becomes absolute greatness.  Every time I play Relayer, I program my CD player to play tracks 2 - 1 - and 3.
076790592X|4.0|Honestly, when i first opened the book i figured, ' what kind of book can tuesdays with morrie  be about?' but right when i began reading i was hooked, the book makes you want to keep reading. ending the chpaters in a mysterious suspense, making you want to know more. what i truly liked best about this book is the fact that its rare for me to find books that talk about the topics that were discussed in this book. Majority of pople have a diffficult time dealing with the true meanings behind what makes life life, being love, hapiness, death, and even pain. this book can truly be an eye opener for alot of people, morrie had alot of knowledge to offer about many topics many people can't deal with. and mitch just had the ability to put it down on paper.
B00009Z576|5.0|I noticed he would've given a Bartok Concerto 5 stars &quot;were it not for one flaw - the haunting woodwind theme in the second movement of Concerto #1 is too soft.&quot;<br />My advice, Mr. Richman, is quit using the Preparation H.  <br />YOU'RE NOT USING IT CORRECTLY!!!<br />This remaster is incredible and the bonus tracks alone are worth the price of the CD!
1572814349|5.0|Kudos all around for this deck.  It is a shame that Amazon (at this writing) does not offer any pictures of this deck.  It is truly a beautiful deck.  If you are wondering, I would suggest looking at aeclectic.net or tarotpassages.com to see if they are offering reviews or pictures of the cards in this deck.<br />What makes this deck truly special is the work put into it on both the creative end and the production end.  Kat Black put great work into establishing a wonderful medieval feel to this deck.  Though it is a collage, it doesn't come off looking like a collage.  She also avoided using familiar paintings so as to give this deck a freshness, like you are looking at something newly discovered.<br />Black also demonstrates a deep understanding of tarot symbology and infuses this deck with it.  The trouble with many themed decks, such as those based on painters such as Da Vinci or Bosch, is that, though pretty, they are not good decks to do readings with. There are enough symbolic imagery in each card to get a deep reading with it.  She bases the imagery on the well-known Waite/Smith imagery that will be recognizable to people who even only have a passing familiarity with tarot.  Yet, it seems to have a deeper, older tradition tied to it.<br />U.S. Games production work here is phenomenal here also.  The box is sturdy and compact, not allowing the cards to slide around, and also comes with Black's book, which is compact and comprehensive.  She gives meanings that are not generic and offer not only her reasons for her choice of images, but gives the reader references to these elements.<br />I could go on and on, but, in brief, if you want a deck that it readable, feels like an old renaissance work, and is just generally beautiful, you cannot do better than this one!
B00007LTIA|5.0|I noticed he would've given a Bartok Concerto 5 stars &quot;were it not for one flaw - the haunting woodwind theme in the second movement of Concerto #1 is too soft.&quot;<br />My advice, Mr. Richman, is quit using the Preparation H.  <br />YOU'RE NOT USING IT CORRECTLY!!!<br />And instead of leaving the same comment on each album, I'll have you know that this is the BEST issue of Tales.  Sonically blew me away!!!  I wan't too impressed with the bonus cuts here, but the remastered sound is what's best on this particular release.<br />Far superior to the Atlantic Re-issue!
B00005JN1L|3.0|I've followed Johnny Depp with interest since Edward Scissorhands. Of course, last summer's \\"Pirates\\" only increased that interest! It's absolutely the only reason I was willing to shell out for this movie. Too bad. I wish I'd waited for video.<br />I'm not sure why he took this role. I suppose for the interest of playing this good guy/ bad guy character. If they'd stuck to the original plot, the author and the crazed stalker whose story the author may or may not have stolen, it could have been a suspenseful movie. I was looking forward to a showdown between Rainey & Shooter. <br />The plot twist seemed like a cop-out to me, similar to the infamous \\"it was only a dream\\" Dallas episode. Plus, I must admit, I didn't enjoy seeing Depp as a bad guy, at least not this particular kind of Stephen King horror movie villain. One thing I will say: Depp does make the character creepy. The thing he does with his mouth becomes absolutely scary, enough to cancel out the sexiness of \\"Pirate.\\"<br />Even that, and Mr. Depp's looks, didn't make this really worth my time, especially given the endless commercials and movie previews I had to sit through, after paying the inflated ticket price. Help!<br />I just hope this doesn't signal Depp becoming the type of actor who does B-movies for money. That would be a real horror show. Fortunately, I don't see it happening.
0345457684|5.0|Richard Morgan's Altered Carbon is an excellent, intriguing novel that straddles multiple genres, and straddles them well.  It's science fiction in that it takes place in the distant future when individual consciousness can be downloaded into a new body (or sleeve) should the need ever arise.  There is plenty of space travel as the protagonist and narrator, Takeshi Kovacs travels from his world to what we know as earth.  Altered Carbon is also a crime novel, as Kovacs has been hired to find the &quot;murderer&quot; of a centuries old wealthy man, who's consciousness was simply downloaded into a newly cloned sleeve.  The story is well-written, compelling reading.  Very enjoyable and imaginative.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|And so it should be. It's perhaps the best film he has ever been in, even though he was also very good in &quot;Rushmore&quot;, &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; and &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot;. I can't figure out how those who claim to be Murray fans completely disregard the man's own assessment of the movie.<br />Murray is a veteran. Johannsen is a newcomer. And yet she is completely his equal on the screen. In her lostness, I'm reminded a little of Monica Vitti in her early years. She can portray a lot with just the smallest expression. Sometimes humans wear faces like masks, and it takes those with some EQ to see beyond the mask.<br />I am very impressed with Sofia Coppola. I appreciate a film-maker who doesn't feel I need to have glaring signs posted on every scene and lets me figure a few things out for myself.<br />Obviously, judging by one star reviews here, not everyone can.<br />To those who say the film had nothing to offer, all I can say is the film had nothing for you. Fortunately it had a lot for others. I expect there'll be films that you like and they hate too.

B00005JLCI|5.0|I am impatiently waiting for the DVD Widescreen edition to be released so I might once again venture into the beauty of Shakespeare.  Never have I understood the previously released films of Hamlet.  Performances were great, but the shorten verisons did nothing but confuse me with references to the various sub-plots.  This film pulled me into its incredible story and opened the worlds of classics.  Never before had I attended a movie at a theater more than once and this film I attended over a dozen times!  Kenneth Branagh opened up my eyes and I have since purchased numerous DVDs of Shakespearen stories.  Please hurry and release the DVD!  You are denying many the introduction and appreciation of this classic.
B000084T18|1.0|Total garbage.  I've never heard such trash.
0871359448|3.0|This is supposed to be one of those classic Marvel storylines. You can tell they were trying to write it that way. And it does have some interesting moments (turning Wolverine to rubber) but as a whole it isn't just that great. You get a lot of minor characters who are all powerful doing major things. It's just not that great of a story.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I think this is Britney's best CD to date.  I play this CD all the time.  In the Zone, Baby..one More time, and Oops I did it again can't compare to this CD.  You go girl!!!
B0000B1OFL|3.0|Let me say that this film has an excellent cast, who works well with each other, lots of action and effects, and you'll be highly entertained throughout. The only problem I had was that everything was wrapped up too neatly, there was nothing to figure out. Other than that, it was very fun, but nothing I would watch over and over. Definitely rent it, but buying it is up to you.
B000099T2L|3.0|This was all in the plan from the beginning.  Matthew Knowles had one goal in common; to make sure his little girl reach the top.  He surely didn't care about Kelly, Michelle or any of the other girls that left the group.  This CD got so much promotion.  What about Kelly and Michelle's CDs?  There CD didn't even get promoted that well.  They were good CD too.  I think Beyonce and her father is one of the biggest phonies in the entertainment business.  Like I said in the beginning; this was the plan from the start.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|A box office special effects hit it is not. Hollywood, however needs more human films like this. These stories about the interplay between different people, who may only meet for but a short time in their life, and may be world's apart age-wise, are important. Basically, Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor who decides to take a commercial gig in Japan, pending his next role. Murray feels like a fish out of water down there, and ponders returning early until he meets an American girl, brilliantly played by Scarlett Johansen, who feels the same as him. Her recent husband, played by Giovanni Ribissi, tends to neglect her alot as he's working on his own career as a photographer. Inevitably Murray and Johansen become friends and explore Japan together. If you like independent films, and you can be patient, this film is worth the trip.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I must admit that this CD is really good.  The only thing I hate to say is that Christina has gotten so full of herself when it comes to her voice.  I mean, I know she can sing but she feels that no one can sing better that her.  She's so arrogant when it comes to her voice.  When Beyonce gave that marvelous performance at the grammys, I knew that Christina felt bad.  Beyonce just let her have it.
B000001Y2U|5.0|The Antichrist Superstar is the best album <BR>ever recorded by Marilyn Manson.<br />I saw this show the year the album came out.<BR>I was so angry at all the church people<BR>that were standing in front of the Wallace<BR>Center in Fichburg,Mass.They had their picket <BR>sign's and all they kept saying was &quot;Jesus loves you.&quot;<br />I wanted to tell them,&quot;Why don't you see a Marilyn Manson <BR>show,then you will find out that he does not sacrifice<BR>animal's,he does not kill people and he does not <BR>worship Satan.It's all an act,even his image is<BR>all an act.I saw this tour and walked out of the<BR>show with a big smile on my face,that proves I<BR>had a kick ass time at the concert and it was alot <BR>of fun.That goes for every parent who won't let<BR>their kid's see his concert or let them listen<BR>to his music.Kid's,tell your parent's to go to the <BR>show with you and let them see what it's all about.<br />This is a must own album for every Manson fan.<BR>There is not one song I do not like on it.<BR>It is definetley his heaviest album ever.<BR>This is my favorite Manson album.
0767817478|5.0|When Godzilla was first created, Toho Studios just cancelled a major historical epic.  They needed something fast.  The legend of the Whale-Ape came up and Godzilla was born (Gojira to many).  Not a lot of thought went into the creature.  In this US version I think the problem was that too much thought went into the creature.<br />Godzilla has sprung from a monitor lizard and French nuclear testing.  The monster travels to New York City where it tries to nest and procreate.<br />The US Military and the French Secret Service are trying to stop it.  One openly and one covertly.  Nick Tatopoulos (Broderick) gets caught up in both attempts.<br />When I first saw this movie, I had just crushed both of my thumbs just an hour earlier.  The movie was so gripping that I didn't notice the pain.  But this movie is NOT Godzilla.  Yes they call it that, but it isn't.  It is, however, a wonderful giant monster film.<br />The film is loaded with wonderful details.  A favorite is hearing Godzilla stomping in the distance and seeing a television in the corner with Barney jumping up and down.  Another is a take-off of the three-barrels scene from Jaws.  Other films also pop up either directly, like the clip of It Came From Beneath The Sea, or staged like a scene from Casablanca.<br />The makers of this film did a wonderful job of making a movie, but they did a lousy job with the concept of Godzilla.<br />The disc has some nice extras including some of the teaser trailers for the movie (but not the new years one), a music video, stills, production featurette, a mocumentary, and more.<br />Again, it would have been a huge success had the main character gone by a name other than Godzilla.
B000002U82|5.0|I was 3 years old the first time I heard this album. I am 32 now. I still love it. I remember listening to it as a child, and being captivated by the album cover, and wondering what the lyrics meant, particularly 'Us and Them'....it was my moms record. She loved it too. As a teenager, I listened to this album from time to time, and realized how much it had woven its way into my musical influences, and I started to see what some of the words meant, albeit in an adolescent sort of way. Different songs became favorites at different times. It was always a companion - something to take me back to being three years old, and being captivated by its magic so early in my life. In my twenties, the weight of the lyrics began to astound me, as I realized that 'ten years had got behind me' and that what Waters had written about resonated with me in a way very few if any albums had. I have just listened to the album once more - the same copy my mom owned when I was very small. It is likely that I will never tire of this album, even if I only give it a proper listen once a year or so. Each time is like the first, each listen revealing something new and creating a sense of serene wonder, and nostalgic sadness, as the words and music found in it seem to do so gracefully. It is very hard for me to imagine what it would be like to hear this album for the first time now...I expect that like all great and timeless recordings, it will affect each listener regardless of age, as it encompasses words, music and production to near perfection. My tastes in music over the years have run the gamut from indie rock, to electronic, to ambient, to experimental - it could be said that Dark Side of the Moon is the perfect encapsulation of all of these disparate styles. A masterpiece.
B00009V7T2|5.0|this cd is absolutely increadible, anyone who wishes to advance their musical ability, creativity, and inspiration must get this concept disk.  it is one of the few good cds that is amazing all the way through.  every person in this group is one of the best at what they do, especially the vocals.  the lead singer is someone straight of a big hair band, but with a different style of music.  Everyone must recognize the talent that this group posesses even if you do not appreciate the rock genre of music.  My friend who introduced me to this group said that he truely believes that this group &quot;is only alive to make music.  they go to a show, then after the show they crawl back in their coffin and head to their next show.  they are unhuman.&quot; this cd is a must have.  (best song on cd is televators, around the 3 min. mark)
B00006RU5B|5.0|It's rare that you come across a CD that offers so many great songs.  I never get sick of listening to this one.  Fabulous CD!
B000002KXO|4.0|The other reviews hit the nail on the head.  Very good songs, not the best, but still a good album.<br />But why this album has not received the Remastering of the previous albums is beyond me.  It is by far the worst sound of any CD I own, even worse than some bootlegs.  Very soft and flat.  I expect more from a perfectionist like Mr. Buckingham.<br />FM, if you read this, clean this great album up.  It's a classic.
B00005JMQ0|5.0|This brilliant work by director Morris is the stuff of life. And death.  It arouses the most basic moral and immoral questions of being human through an enormously complex and yet simple man, Robert Strange McNamara. It seems no coincidence, his middle name, as we get to know him in all his cleverness and contradictions.  Morris subtly illuminates, literally through McNamara's eyes, what it means to have power over life and death.  Like God.  There is something almost spiritual in McNamara's eyes, edited against searing images of, well, graphs, statistics, memoranda, bursting firebombs and nuclear mushrooms, almost all rarely seen-before footage.  The eyes are the soul of this film - McNamara's are a combination of supreme confidence and extreme doubt.  But not only his eyes - for example, we see President Kennedy's eyes frozen in the lens as he tells the nation of imminent nuclear war in 1962, a look that would make a Marine shiver.  This new interview technique (\\"interrotron\\" ) draws us into what?  War? Peace? Honor? Life? Power? Evil? <br />Born 85 years ago, McNamara is the quintessential man of his time, what Brokaw called the greatest generation, a sobriquet this documentary underscores.  In McNamara's words he deplored the sorrow and pity of the four great wars of his lifetime; the trenches in France; the nuclear and indiscriminate firebombing of innocent Japanese; the debacle in Korea; the flaming jungles of Vietnam.  His command of statistics is breathtaking.  But it is the eyes that reveal an inner truth, the precise opposite of his concise, rational words - his 11 \\"lessons\\".  We see a man who never found himself in harm's way.  We see eyes so ironically blinded by a circa 1918 vision of duty and honor that, though he loathed the horrifics of Vietnam, he was compelled to allow his true judgment to go unexpressed until nearly 60,000 Americans were dead.  He was at once perhaps the most powerful man in the world and its most despicable.  It is easy to see why a brilliant young President Kennedy would choose someone as Defense Secretary who seemed so like himself, but tragically without the courage.  And why, with Kennedy's death, McNamara by sheer ambition and brilliance would ascend to the very pinnacle of power.<br />Yet, I couldn't hate this guy.  Perhaps the most telling moment is McNamara's clear devastation at Kennedy's assassination 41 years ago, again told in his eyes and a rare, emotional choking voice.  So it's difficult to blame him for all those deaths he might have prevented -- McNamara genuinely believed he was doing the right thing for his Presidents: through an obsessive sense of duty and loyalty.  Now that his day of legacy approaches, he expresses criticism over the actions of others -- General LeMay and President Johnson are the favored targets.  But McNamara cannot quite bring himself to admit his own mistakes of enormous proportions.  Yet it's quite clear that he was one of only two men who could have ended the 7-year slaughter (of his term in office). Many may find that failure a reason to despise the man. I found it just human.<br />This film offers up no easy answers (certainly not his 11 \\"lessons'), but more importantly raises many fundamental questions.  Philip Glass' elegiac, edgy scoring perfectly meshes with this thriller. An impressive and important contribution to understanding our nation's ambivalent past.
B00005JKNC|5.0|&quot;THE MAJESTIC&quot;<br />Everyone is fantastic in this movie. Very tight acting and very believable characters. It's easy to care for them and want what they want. Jim Carrey is fantastic, too. He can really bring a tear to the eye when he wants to. He does a SUPERB JOB and I am impressed. I didn't know Ace Ventura had it in him.<br />If you like movies that are meaningful and thought pervoking then I highly recommend 'The Majestic'. Taking a serious movie in, now and then, helps to keep life into perspective. GREAT MOVIE!!!
B000059ZLH|4.0|i Agree with what i have read in other reviews, Yes this dvd is a overproduced with some very annoying cut scenes/graphics. But it didnt really stop me from enjoying this dvd, I have never been to a DT concert, but iam definately a fan of the band , and their live performance is simply amazing. Hearing Mike Portnay destroy the drums on the cd is one thing, but watching it is something truly special, this man rocks. Fine performances all around, Its like watching a masterpiece being performed, The bonus materials are not lacking and are sure to please DT fans, This is definately worth buying for any DT fans and metal fans
B00005JMJ4|5.0|There are 966 user reviews at the time that I write this, so I realize the futility of adding yet another voice to the chaos that will probably never be completely sorted through completely by anyone thinking about purchasing this movie, but on the off chance that someone will read this, here's my opinion anyway.<br />I liked this movie. A lot.  Lost in Translation seems to run the gamut of reactions to it though.  Some people love it, some people hate it, others remain bored and indifferent.  Here's a brief rundown of why I love it<BR>1.  Coppola's camera.  The cinematography is beautiful, the camera tech reflects and amplifies the story, and Tokyo is allowed to shine.<BR>2.  The writing.  Dialogue is well-crafted and the actions are significant.  Also, though some say it's a boring movie, I liked the pacing.<BR>3.  Coppola's character direction.  The nuances of the performances and what's said and what's not said, these things come together to create vivid character studies.  And of course, to go with this...<BR>4.  The actors.  Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, and Giovanni Ribisi are all very good and convincing.  The interactions between these characters almost become separate entities in themselves.<BR>5.  All that pretentious conceptual stuff.  Hey, I don't think it's a pretentious film, but others seem to think so.  I actually thought this movie hit the mark it was aiming for, in tone and in a consistent portrayal of themes.  For me, this is about alienation and the power and weakness of words.  And it's a love story.  Actually, speaking of that, my last and most specific point...<BR>6.  The romance avoids cliches.  Sure, a lesser director with less imagination might've pandered to the audience and these two leads would eventually end up in the sack in a Lolita-esque conclusion, but I think it's more believable the way it all actually works out, and there's more emotional impact in the end in my opinion.  I applaud Coppola's choice to keep this affair subdued.  Even though Bob and Charlotte's relationship seems to be sexual at some deep level, it's not about sex.  It's about how these characters find each other and relate to each other so fantastically, in words but more importantly in ways words can't convey.<br />that's it for me.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|awesome movie the action kept coming the war between werewolves and vampires was an awesome story line i must see for an horro fan
B00006V9A0|5.0|This CD shows some of the Best of Nirvana if you are a fan you must get this.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies ever made, my friend! An excellent work of art! A million good things about this movie, but I have a limited space to work with so....   *The fight choreography, especially, is genius. Beautifully done.    *Tarintino wastes no time getting the story started - right away BAM! and you're in the middle of it.   *The actors are superb! Uma Thurman should have received the Academy Award for Best Actress most definatly!   *The soundtrack is awsome!   *The visuals are stunning.   *This movie is the apitome of cool (well, this and the Matrix)   *The swords are awsomeness itself!   *It's fun!   Buy it! It is absolute genius! Onl thing is the blood for those who are a bit squimish, yeah, there is a lot of blood. But don't let that deter ye, it is a must!!!
1591391105|5.0|I was on day 6 of a new CEO job and everything was falling apart -- I encountered serious resistance to even minor changes that obviously needed to be made.  Reading this book, I realized I had walked into a problem where management saw the company was in need of a turnaround, but the employees had no idea and saw their company as a steady success story.  <br />Every bit of this book is gold.  From how to approach change implementation based on situation, to managing upwards, to making the mental switch to your new position, it's all been helpful.
B000002RXS|5.0|This San Diego person abused Yahoo's guidelines once again. But of course Carmen isn't a pop opera, what Theo meant is that it is so POPular, therefore the calling. The San Diego person doesn't even get that. And it is part of the musical ancestors of the great Musicals, where one hit follows the other. Carmen is an opera comique, here we hear the recitatives instead which isn't too bad. Callas sounds fatal and lusty as Carmen, Gedda sounds brilliant and Massard outsings most other Escamillos. The ongoing insults towards Callas by the San Diego person are a shame.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill volume 1 is probably 1 of THE best movies ever made. It is a funny blood drenched spoof about a young woman who is betrade, by her colleagues and left for dead. she wakes up one day and finds that she has been in a comae for 4 years. And now she is seeking revenge on those have betrade her. This is a must see and when Kill Bill volume 2 comes out be sure to see that to. I give the movie a 10 out of 5 (I had to choose 5 becuase thats the limit.) I'll write a revew of the second film when I see it. Thanks for reading my review. ...-thank you
B00000K0DT|1.0|Begins as a stylish crime drama, and stops dead in its tracks right there. For it also tries to con the audience, a la THE STING; HOUSE OF GAMES; THE SIXTH SENSE. And here it fails to measure up.  <br />When properly done, the movie con can be a wonderful brain teaser for the audience: its mis-direction performing a magic show of the mind. And when all is eventually revealed, the upper consciousness is delightfully surprised and stimulated. One can go back and watch (and re-watch), the aforementioned films and take notice of the subtle clues, the intricate scenes patterned purposely throughout, to mask the cons; and he/she marvels at the inventive devices used. All this works as long as a basic tenet is observed: the clues and scenes MUST be true. Honesty between the filmmaker and his audience is paramount. No excuses allowed. In this film though, to 'sting' the audience, the method used is to simply LIE. That's all this film does. A critical scene is premised at the beginning of the movie, it's repeated several times through the course of the movie, and then at the end the filmmakers say, &quot;Oh, we were just kidding, this is what 'really' happened. Fooled you!&quot; Have they no faith in the intelligence of the audience? Probably do. But the truth appears to be much simpler: they just didn't know how to craft the con. Ultimately it was abject laziness on the part of the writers and director. They didn't take the extra effort. They didn't know how to formulate an inovative 'sting', so they took a cheesy way out and LIED to us. And not an ingenious lie mind you, but a CHEAP, CLUMSY lie. Instead of a sophisticated movie, we get the GONG SHOW. Unforgiveable. <br />Without spoiling anything; there are numerous clues as to the identity of Keyser Sozer. But these are unintentional and sloppy clues that any keen moviegoer can figure out shortly after first grasping the convoluted theme, (even the film's premise itself is somewhat muddled due to the awkward script). Given the plot, the characterizations, who was who (and after accepting you've been lied to) -- I mean: who else 'can' it be? A good movie, that could have been great, but a disappointment instead.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I just rented spirited away last friday and even though I've watched it twice it is so awesome. it is delivered beautifuly with really nice characters that go so well together. and it is a really intresting story about a girl at first doesn't know what is going on and is whiny and compling but then really has to grow up and make sure her parents don't stay pigs forever. it is also kinda a romantic movie with what's going on between chihrio and haku I mean it's kinda sweet and sappy.
0812550706|4.0|I've never been a huge sci-fi fan but a co-worker pestered me into reading his copy of Ender's Game. I am so in love with this book that yes, I'd like to marry it.<BR>Ender is a tragic hero. You can't help but love him even though you know the adults in his life have ruined any chance for him to truly feel loved or accept love without suspicion. The recruiting officer, Graff, grows heavy with guilt throughout the story and it's interesting to see him physically gain weight as his role at the Battle School effects his conscience. Ender's peers are each fascinating and you continually marvel at the brilliance and maturity they display at such young ages. Ender's brother and sister play important parts and are complex and compelling. Peter, the eldest, is horrible but you almost root for him to succeed. Valentine, the middle child, is lovely even as she manipulates her beloved brother, Ender. Mazer is the necessary tough-love mentor and the buggers provide a thoughtful commentary on xenophobia.<br />All of these characters combine to form one far-out, interplanetary plot. I especially love that I never saw the climax coming. It's so refreshing to be surprised by a plot twist.<BR>I enjoyed this book so much. In fact, I was reading Ender's Game in the dreaded prison of a physician's waiting room and felt intense irritation when they finally called my name. I had my eyes dilated and gripped my book, squinting and blinking, until the very end when I simply couldn't see the words clearly any longer. At that moment I despised the eye doctor, a perfectly nice man, for even momentarily robbing me of my ability to read.<BR>The end of the book peters out, but after all the suspense and excitement, there had to be an emotional let-down. Not that it's a bad ending. It makes sense and was necessary for Ender. I'd like to know what the heck happened to Peter, but perhaps it's in a sequel edition. Another thing, if the planet's been attacked twice by aliens and everyone's afraid of being wiped out if it happens again, why are population control measures in place?<BR>Anyhoo, it's a great book. Very entertaining. I loved it. Thanks Mr. Card.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This Ablum was a breath of fresh air! I wonderful piece to listen to no matter when or how you are feeling. Josh Grodan has a one of a kind voice that is so wonderful to listen to. He differently stands out in the crowd of other singers.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|Initially, I did not want to see this film, however, after seeing the trailer, I thought that there was enough action and adventure to keep the film interesting. I should have trusted my first instinct. <BR>     As it turns out, all the action is in the first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes. Unfortunately, the two hours in between is as boring and vapid as any movie since The English Patient. I would have left this movie had I not been with friends (none of whom enjoyed the film either).
1401300901|5.0|I absolutely loved &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;.  I didn't want it to end, ever.  Holly and all her friends make you laugh one minute and then cry the next, like a rollercoaster ride.  I loved it so much I passed it around to the girls at work and they are enjoying it to.  We hope she writes another one soon, or makes a movie about this one.  For a new author she sure does have a sense of humor and definitely a following.
B00005JN1L|5.0|Although Johnny is known for his good looks, he shows his true talent as an artist and plays a not so glamorous writer who is suffering from depression.  The story is well written and keeps you guessing...you are constantly trying to put the puzzle pieces together.  We went to see it to twice because of the twist at the end.  Excellent movie!
B00000K3G8|4.0|Having just cruised through the reviews for Stop Making Sense I didn't see any mention of Bernie Worrell, whose keyboard brilliance MAKES this album. Give credit where credit is due and applaud Mr. Worell. I hope he gets a cut of every copy of this CD that's sold.
B000056HOZ|5.0|A nice summary of Bruce's early video work.  However, why the edit on &quot;Rosalita&quot; - the band introductions (which were originally included when the video came out in the 80's) were a lot of fun.  I'd love to find a copy of them.<br />Otherwise, a great presentation
B000066NW0|1.0|What a lyric! &quot;She was a girl, He was a boy&quot; whichever comes first I don't care. No sense at all! Avril is a poser! she can't sing and this girl wears hideous clothes! &quot;Sk8r Boi or Boy&quot; whatever! is a song for non-intelligent people. The lyrics to most of her songs especially the cuts made for singles can make people dumb by just listening to it. Simple. Don't buy the record as it totally has no substance at all following the very first track!
B00000255F|5.0|From the lonely piano/harmonica introduction to &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to the sorrowful cry at the end of &quot;Jungleland&quot;, Born to Run is one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever made.  If you are looking to check out Bruce Springsteen, start here!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Like any good Beatles fan, I used to grouse about how Phil Spector puked all over &quot;Let it Be&quot; when it was supposed to be a return to the roots, blah blah blah. And then I heard &quot;Let it Be... Naked.&quot; Ugh. &quot;Let it Be&quot; is the worst of the Beatles' albums anyway (though still better than 95% of the garbage out there), and stripping it down makes it that much worse. I realize now that the cheesy orchestral bits actually helped. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; is an atrocity. So is &quot;Get Back.&quot; The Beatle chatter CD is too short and random and could have been so much better. Also, I really haven't been too impressed with the way Macca is trying to &quot;fix&quot; things-- including changing &quot;Lennon/ McCartney&quot; to &quot;McCartney/ Lennon.&quot; Paul wouldn't have dared try any of this if John were still alive. I wish he'd left this alone. Or relegated it to the Anthology.
0793518326|5.0|This is an excellent book. Good for all the musicians out there that love the Beatles.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|I recently purchased this DVD as I always dreamed my daughter would one day attend a Seven Sister College. Thank goodness this film is an archaic, stereotypical, and completely MISOGYNISTIC portrayal of the women's colleges that helped the shape of women's lives today.<br />The part I most resent about this movie, aside from the flat dialogue, is the writer's attempt to &quot;de-feminist&quot; the film by showing a smart woman who &quot;chooses&quot; to follow her husband like a dog rather than attend law school. I mean, really. Why not take a look at that girl in 15 years when her snotty nosed brats are crying all day while her husband works 15 hour days, and she is see feels &quot;liberated&quot;.
B00004CWO8|1.0|In my time I have seen hundreds of performances of Swan Lake by many different companies. Bourne's version is by far the worst rendition of Swan Lake I have ever seen. It is a perverted parody and any resemblance to Swan Lake is purely coincidental. It must be shocking to any true lovers of ballet.<br />Unlike performances by the Royal Ballet or the Bolshoi or Kirov which fit the music like a glove, the music in this ballet is only incidental. There is no grace or precision in this performance. Just a bunch of unsynchronized apes prancing and at times just stumbling around. The filming is a disaster. The camera does not stay focused on the \\"dancing.\\" Perhaps that is because the \\"dancing\\" is so bad that Bourne wants to divert the viewers attention away from it..<br />People have a good taste in music and particularly in ballet should avoid watching this sickening and disgusting version. I wish I had.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|WMXX had the most hype of any event ever. I had high hopes and I almost knew they could not be met. <BR>The show started off with a decent but slow opener between Cena and Show. It was entertaining although Cena's freestyle was terrible and his crowd support dropped a lot. 7/10<BR>Raw fatal 4-way was real weak. Short and painless, Cade and Jindrak did nothing and the Dudleys and Resistance were sleepwalking. 4/10<BR>Jericho vs Christian was a solid performance- not their best but decent. The Trish turn was the only surprise of the night 7/10<BR>Rock and Sock vs Evolution was a let down. There was nothing new here and Foley was terrible. Rock and Orton carried this match. 6/10<BR>Evening Gown match was a waste of time. Once ur in playboy whats the point of evening gowns. The wrestling was horrible. Stacy was the only one worth watching. 3/10<BR>Cruiserweight open was the worst waste of talent ever. Given about 10 mins for 10 men...only 2 in the ring at a time? COME ON WWE! what could have been the best high flyer battle royal turned into a horrendous display with only kidman and mysterio worth watching. 5/10<BR>Brock vs Goldberg should have been a classic. It ended up being the worst match of the night. A 5 min standoff and only 5 offensive manuevers and no austin action? 1/10 PITIFUL!<BR>Smackdown 4 way was worse than raw...worlds greatest tag team is by far the only team that can work in that match. luckily it was short and horrible. 2/10<BR>Womens match was also a letdown with no good moves pulled. a crappy ending and not entertaining. worst part is molly looks better bald. 2/10<BR>Finally we get to the big 3 matches. Guerrero vs Angle was a solid effort though not as good as expected. Angle always puts on a good show and eddie just seemed only 90%. 8/10<BR>The undertaker return was the most anticipated match of the night. He ended up coming back looking more like a cowboy with his same biker outfit and a girl haircut. Hes just not the same. He didnt even fly overthe ropes. This match was quick and they had no chemistry. WM14 was much much better. 5/10<BR>I did not have high hopes for the trip-threat but boy was i pleased. Best match of the night by far and the only memorable moment of WMXX. A great performance by all 3 men and WMXX finished on a high note. 10/10.<BR>As for the DVD, the extras are rather lackluster compared to previous years. They include more of the tv shows shown prior to the event rather than this event. They could have put together a much better documentary of the day of mania xx with this 3 disc set which every1 would love. On a side note, the staging is incredible. The effects are wonderfully done. Props to the stage crew. In conclusion, worth watching but dont expect the greatest spectacle of all time
B00005V3Z4|4.0|After hearing about this movie from a friend for the past six months, I finally watched it and was really surprised. I think that, like &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, some people are going to get this and some people aren't.  The previous reviewer who said the acting and dialogue are bad is one of the ones who doesn't.  The dialogue (most particularly Donnie's) is stunted because it's supposed to be.  The kid is not OK...he's got issues.  This isn't the typical Hollywood prettyboy playing an unpopular teen.  I've known kids a lot like him, and Gyllenhaal's portrayal of the character is amazing. Some movies are more than just entertainment, and this is one such movie.
B0001611DI|4.0|1978's DAWN OF THE DEAD is the second entry in George Romero's &quot;DEAD&quot; trilogy, though it isn't as scary or as groundbreaking as his first, the classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968).  Still, for a low-budget sequel, it is an interesting and entertaining film, an unusual mix of action, drama, comedy, and horror that actually functions on two levels: One, it is a stomach-churning study of the depths to which people will sink in order to ensure their survival; and two, it is a dark satire that takes several pokes at Western consumerism.<br />The plot of DAWN OF THE DEAD builds on the premise of its predecessor.  The world is now becoming overrun with the flesh-eating zombies, and in the United States, martial law has been declared and all survivors are required to go to state-run &quot;rescue stations&quot; for shelter and protection.  The manager of a TV station and her helicopter-pilot boyfriend decide to defy authorities and seek out their own save haven, and two police officers--friends of the helicopter pilot--decide to abandon their duties and go along with the couple.  The group eventually arrives at an abandoned shopping mall, and when they realize that the stores within contain all they need to survive--food, clothing, and weapons &amp; ammunition--they seal off the building, dispose of most of the zombies inside, and take up residence.  But when their claim on the mall and its goods is challenged by a band of motorcycle-riding marauders, the quartet is soon fighting for survival against not only the zombies, but also against their own kind.<br />Although the audience has been made to sympathize with the film's four protagonists, there is no true heroism in this world of Romero's making.  Instead, there are only different levels of self-interest and narcissism.  After the four move into their new home and start living off the &quot;fat of the mall,&quot; they quickly develop a sort of bourgeois attitude towards the comforts they now enjoy.  Of course, that is exactly the Western attitude that Romero is ridiculing--that sense of security and satisfaction one feels after amassing material goods.  And when the group's right to possession is violently challenged by outsiders, Romero clearly demonstrates just how tenuous a security based on personal possessions really is.<br />Romero is a master storyteller who knows how to manipulate the emotions of his audience.  In this film, he creates a relentless sense of unease by juxtaposing the repulsive and grotesque with the lighthearted and humorous.  For example, when the quartet of protagonists first occupies the mall, they turn on the mall-wide Muzak system to mask from the zombies the noises they make while looting the stores.  So for several scenes there is this macabre contrast between bloody, pasty-faced zombies and syrupy instrumental music.  Uncomfortably comical and humorously disturbing.<br />Creepy, bloody (FX by Tom Savini), boisterous, and constantly full of surprises, DAWN OF THE DEAD is easily one of the most entertaining zombie movies ever made.  True, it does have an underlying anti-materialism message that is none too subtle, but that doesn't detract in the least from the enjoyment of being playfully spooked and repulsed by all the zombie grotesquerie.  All in all, horror fans will have a good time watching this minor Romero masterpiece.<br />The Divimax Edition DVD from Anchor Bay offers an excellent digital transfer of the U.S. theatrical cut (often considered superior even to the director's cut), and there are lots of cool extras, too, not the least of which is a feature commentary with writer/director Romero and FX man Savini.  A worthy addition to the film collections of serious horror fans, and well worth amazon.com's very reasonable asking price.e, that is exactly the Western attitude that Romero is ridiculing--that sense of security and satisfaction one feels after amassing material goods.

0345409671|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like the story or not, seeing how completely unreligious I am, but once I got into it more, it really hooked me. Anne Rice has such a gift for storytelling, and she really uses it here. <br />It's such an interesting way to look at religion, and you truly feel sympathy for Memnoch, the Devil. Lestat is one of the best literary characters of our time, and he's back in full form here.
B00012QM86|5.0|I have never in my life watched a movie that is so heartwrenching as Schindler's List.  The only problem I had was the violence, HOWEVER it is history and it's sad to say this really happened.  I watched this movie for the first time after it came out on tape, and I couldn't sleep all night.  It's a very thought provoking, shocking, and stunning movie.  I wouldn't recommend it for children, but I think it's something that EVERYONE should watch.
B000067J1H|5.0|Heck, you don't even have to be a Brad Pitt fan to enjoy this movie (though I must admit, the shirtless and covered in blood look really works for him...)<br />The Cast: We have a hard hitting, off the wall, home-made dynamite and soap producer. A therapy/help session - addicted insomniac. The beautiful chain smoking beauty that comes between tham, and the underground bloody mayhem of Fight Club.<br />This is a great movie, well cast and superbly acted. If you're not especially fond of wanton violence nd lots of blood, then I wouldn't say this movie is for you. However, it's not completely superficial. There's a lot going on underneath the surface, clues to the excellent twist at the end. You'll need to watch it again, just to pick them out. So, we've got cute guys, shirtless and beating each other up as a form of therapy, a psychological twist that will make your head spin and lots of mayhem on the side for fun. A formula for a witty and thought-provoking film. (Even if the only thoughts that are provoked are: &quot;Wow, Brad Pitt is really really cute!&quot;)<br />As the box says:<br />Mischief<br />Mayhem<br />Soap.<br />Welcome to Fight Club.
B000069AUI|1.0|I bought this cd thinking I was going to like it. Who wants to hear music that sounds like alternative music played on a piano. This group is one of the worst I have ever heard. Also take note that this group is not played on the radio. It sounds like his piano is out of tune.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|This PPV was so cool some of the matches going the way I wanted<BR>some not but still all matches were promoted very very well.<BR>There were some Hall of Fame inductes in the arena. The match results were: Goldberg beats Lesnar (Lesnar leaves WWE and switching over to the NFL)Chris Beniot beats HHH and HBK<BR>John Cena beats Big Show, Undertaker beats Kane, Eddie beats Kurt, Torri and Sable beats Stacy and Miss Jackie, Evolution beats The Rock n Sock Connection, Christian beats Chris, Victoria beats Molly, Chavo wins the Battle Royal, Rikishi and Scotty 2 hotty beats APA, SPWGTT and the Bashams Brothers, Booker T and RVD beats The Dudleys, Garrison Kade and Mark Jindrak and La Resistance. Extras on the DvD look quite good some matches and interviews ind the 2nd disc and in the 3rd disc there are the 10 Greatest matches at wrestlemania and the mania of WRESTLEMANIA a documentury about wrestlemainia. So 1st disc is the first few matches and 2nd the last few matches and some extras 3rd for extras only. So in my opinion you should get this extrodinary DVD.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Overall, this WrestleMania displayed amazing talent of all the WWE superstars. To make it better, it was the 20th anniversary of a sports spectacular and held at the most Famous Arena in the World: Madison Square Garden.<BR>The matches were:<br />The Big Show vs. John Cena-U.S.Championship<BR>This match was a well deserved win for John Cena who went through all odds to attain his first WWE Belt. 3.5/5<br />Chris Jericho vs. Christian<BR>An upset. Trish turned on her \\"boyfriend\\" for a guy like Christian. The end was basically a set-up that resulted in Chris Jericho getting an unnecessary punsishment and Christian and Trish kissing. Long and action filled match to say the least. 3.5/5<br />Booker T and Rob Van Dam vs. La Resistance vs. Mark Jindrak and Garrison Cade vs. the Dudley Boyz- World Tag Team Championship<BR>Rob Van Dam and Booker T dominated most of the match and their domination resulted in them retaining the World Tag Team Championship. 2.5/5<br />Rock N Sock Connection vs. Evolution's Randy Orton, Ric Flair and Batista<BR>Very interesting match that ended in the wrong way. It seems like Mick isn't as good as he used to and didn't give it his best. Exciting match with shocking parts throughout the match. 3.5/5<br />Inter-Promotional Playboy Evening Gown Match<BR>Smackdown!: Torrie Wilson and Sable vs. Raw: Miss Jackie and Stacy Kiebler<BR>Hot match that made WrestleMania full of excitement, a little short though. 3/5<br />Open Cruiserweight Elimination Match-Cruiserweight Championship<BR>Way too short. Rey Mysterio should of won out of all the others. Cheap ending. 2/5<br />Inter-Promotional Match<BR>Smackdown!: Brock Lesnar vs. Raw: Goldberg- Special Guest Referee Stone Cold Steve Austin<BR>A lot of mind games and intense power shown throughout the match. Pretty short though-- If you add up all the wrestling time together and subtract all the intimidation they used. Goldberg came out on top by using two spears and one Jackhammer Slam to end Brock Lesnar.Strange that Stone Cold stunned Goldberg at the end though. 4/5<br />Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs. the Basham Brothers vs. the APA vs. The Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team- WWE Tag Team Championship<BR>Pretty good match with a cool celebration at the end of the match. All teams gave it all they got to come out on top. 3/5<br />Victoria vs. Molly Holly- WWE Women's Championship- If Molly is to lose, she has to shave her head bald<BR>The match was OK with aggression dished out by both women. Nice ending. Molly's head getting shaven bald by Victoria. She got what was coming. 3/5<br />Eddie Guerrero vs. Kurt Angle- WWE Championship<BR>A lot of technical wrestling used in this match. It was a long match and both guys did whatever they could to win the match. Eddie may have used the cheap way out of this one and it seemed like Kurt Angle had the ropes but the referee didn't see it. But, the end result was Eddie Guerrero retaining the WWE Championship. 4.5/5<br />Inter-Promotional Match<BR>Smackdown!: Undertaker vs. Raw: Kane<BR>Paul Bearer returns! Old-School Undertaker is back! He has risen from the dead and beat Kane with a chokeslam and a tombstone. A little too short of a match, I expected it to be a little longer. 4/5<br />Triple Threat Match- Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Chris Benoit- World Heavyweight Championship<BR>Excellent match. May have been no Disqualification but they all ended up bleeding. All the participants gave it everything they had for the belt. Triple H tried to fight out of the Crippler Crossface, but I guess the lengthy time that he had it on him caused him to tap out. Emotional ending with Chris Benoit finally winning what he has been waiting to win for his whole life: the World Heavyweight Championship. Long-Time friend Eddie Guerrero who retained his title earlier in the evening celebrated Chris Benoit's victory along with him as they both would walk out the arena as champions. 5/5<br />This WrestleMania also showed a sign of Edge's return to the WWE. <br />Overall this night was a 5 hour roller-coaster that brought the roof off Madison Square Garden. <br />This is a must buy DVD that celebrates the greatest sports spectacular of all time- WrestleMania XX!
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a great film, but whta I don't understand is why it got an R rating.  It should be PG-13 because there's no swears are nudity.  Just action.  I don't get it.  Anyway, this is a great film and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's exiting as it get's.  This movie will remain a gem in your collection.  Good disk all in all.  The commentary is my opinian wasn't that good.  It would have been better if Keanu Reeves was in the commentary.  And don't worry if your going to let your kids watch it, cause it isn't bad what so ever.  So grab your kids even if they're 5 years old and watch it with them.  They'll love it like my 5 year old, 8 year old and 11 year old did.  It is a very confusing movie thou.  The other ones in the series aren't as confusing because you learn everything from this one.  This one is my second favorite in the series.  Here's the order I like the Matrix movies 3,1 and then 2.  Yes, you may think I'm weird for liking the third one the best it's just that the first didn't have enough action, the second was a bit too phoney, but third was just action to the max.  I can't wait untill they realese a Matrix Trilogy box set.  I'll be one of the first to buy that.
B00011RPB0|4.0|Lost in Translation, directed by Sofia Coppola, is an interesting movie.  Seeing Japan from western foreigners point of view.  Tokyo and Kyoto have two same syllables kyo and to, but just put the words in reverse position, they represent the old and new Japan.  What is geniune beauty?  Properious city life or tranquility of temples?  What makes the movie so special?  I guess it talks about the conection of strangers in foreign place.  Language, culture, distance, race, food, lifestyle K everything is so different from home.  Does loneliness make you know yourself better or make you get lost?  Light, music, alcohol, killing eye contact, warm temperature of human body,  can they make you feel better or just get more confused?  I gonna find the answer in Tokyo V a mixture of known and unknown.
6302814359|5.0|This is a funny and creepy movie.  It isn't as gory as the first and the third, but it's still great.  James Karen and Thom Mathews from the first ROTLD are back in this one, but playing different characters.  The acting in this is great and I don't like the actor who played Billy.  He sucked.  Anyway, I'm happy to say that this film will be realesed on DVD by Warner in Halloween of 2004.  So fans of the film will be happy with this news.  This will be realesed by Warner along with a few other movies like the It's Alive series.  So fans of that series will be happy with this news.  When it will be realesed it will have a commentary on it.  With who?  I don't have a clue.  Maybe with the director or something.  This film may be a little cheesy at times, but that's what you want from a low budget zombie film.  So, this film's plot is basic and simple.  A military force is shipping the zombies when one of the tanks is lost in the river.  The tank with the zombie in it gets carried over to the cemetery by the stream.  Three kids find it and open it up unleashing a gas that awakes all the zombies in the graveyard.  Will they be able to kill of the zombies.  Or will we all go for a second thrilling ride in Return Of The Living Dead Part 2.  If you like the film, don't buy it on VHS because on Halloween, it's hitting DVD.
B00000JCB2|1.0|i dont know who I hate more, them or Good Charlotte....
B000067CPX|5.0|While their style is continuously changing, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have remained one of the best bands out there for years. This CD is probably one of their best yet although it has a completely different sound than any of the others. I know many people just want the RHCP to keep producing the same stuff and never change (and they're the ones who reviewed this CD negatively) but you'll love this CD if you understand the RHCP are continually exploring new ideas. They're one of the best bands (period) because they don't remain static, they experiment and try new things. So, BUY THIS CD!
B000063Y8F|5.0|This is a heavy duty garlic press, that has held up over time.  I like that it doesn't get discolored, presses garlic easily, and cleans easily, due to the feature that swings the &quot;grill&quot; out when you twist the handles back.  Just rinse/pull away the garlic skins and flip the handles back together.  I highly recommend it.
B0001611DI|3.0|From National Film Critics to us humble Amazon posters, this movie is treated like the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of horror films.  It isn't, though it is pretty good.  The not so subtle message of all Americans in our consumer society being zombies is hammered home ad nauseum at the expense of suspense.  Romero's decision to eject most of the terrific score by Dario Argento regulars &quot;Goblin&quot; and subsitute bland public doman &quot;muzak&quot; is no help either.  Pluses for this film are solid acting, good make-up and a sense of humor.  Minuses, in addition to those previously mentioned, are slack pacing and awkward diologue. <br />NOTE: This film was re-edited by Argento (one of the producers of Dawn) under the title &quot;Zombies&quot; (not to be Lucio Fulci's &quot;Zombie&quot;).  That version also has most of the Goblin score cut out of this version and, happily, is also available on DVD.  Though missing Romero's humor, this version is the preferable one to get and rates four stars in my book&gt;
B0001611DI|5.0|''Dawn of the Dead'' is one of the best films around. I hadn't watched it since hiring it a year and a half ago on video, and the quality wasn't that good, so after purchasing this film and viewing it again the way it should be, I've just fallen in love with this film. I've always been a big fan of 'Day of the Dead' and 'Night Of the Living Dead, not to mention the trilogy of 'Return of the Living Dead', but this film is pretty wonderful. I love how it's in the shopping mall and the whole story with the characters and the Zombie effects. I can't describe in words how cool this film is, you'll just have to see it for yourself. The commentary with George Romero, Tom Savini, Chris Romero and the modderator is very interesting and informative about the film. I definitely recommend this to every horror fan.<BR>by Justine Ryan
B00008EY9G|4.0|I've always loved John Cusak, so when I saw this one I decided to give it a try, even though I hadn't heard of it before seeing it on the shelf. Step by step, you'll find yourself trying to guess who the murderer is, to find out in the end you're probably wrong. I don't know if I totally care for the very end of the movie, which is why I'm going giving it 4 stars, but I would recommend this one if you're into suspense!
B00008S2VG|5.0|This Madonna album, like 1992's Erotics, is hugely underrated.  The album is concise with Madonna's own evolution, both personally and musically.  It fuses dance and gutair smoothly and beautifully... The title track is far from the best track on the album, but its blunt lyrics set us up for exactly whats going on in Madonna's mind during this cd.  Hollywood is pure Madonna pop, and a great fresh sound, but for some reason radio play in the US killed this single and ultimately the album began its rapid dissapearing act...such a shame... I'm So Stupid isnot the most lyrically impressive but its rock edge is refreshing and interesting... Then the album begins its peak with Love Profusion, Nobody Knows Me and Nothing Fails...these are the heart and soul of the album, fun, loving, danceable and anyother emotion you can think of...Intervention and Xtatic Process are accoustic masterpieces and Xtatic is hauntingly deep, yet simple and introspective.  Mother and Father, Die Another Day and Easy ride cap off the album and leaves the listner saying..\\"YOU KNOW IM SATISFIED\\" and wanting more... With Madonna's 2004 World Tour coming up this Summer (...) hopefully the public will give this album the chance and listen it deserves!
B000056NX5|5.0|It is absolutely true that the preformances are over-the-top, but it completely works because of this musical's use of contrasting &quot;light and dark&quot;.  It just serves to deepen the contrast.  This show is flawlessly casted...I have tried but I can't think of anything I don't like about it.  I give it six stars.  The rock n roll arrangements are full of very subtle embellishments, and I hear something different everytime I watch.
0792833279|1.0|This movie was a waste of money. Only good part was that one guy saying the F word a lot. This movie is dull, boring, and is slow developing. I took this DVD and broke it into pieces after I watched it, I had more fun breaking this DVD than watching it. For anyone who is going to buy this DVD I warn you, it is a retarded movie, and waste of your money.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Overall this album is really good. The lyrics are alright and Maynard has a hypnotic voice. Some of these songs want to make you sleep cause they set the mood well.<BR> <BR>1.The Package- When I first hear it I didn't care for it. But now, I know that it only gets better towards the end of the song before it gets good. 3/5<BR>2.Weak and Powerless- I heard this on the radio first. I still like it, but I worry for one day... I will grow tired of it. 4/5<BR>3.The Noose- Wow, a great song. The lyrics are great and then it gradually becomes powerful enough to have a wonderful finish. &quot;With your halo slipn down... to choke you now&quot; 5/5<BR>4.Blue- Also great. Beautiful in its own way. &quot;Ignore the smoke...&quot; I liked it. 4/5<BR>5.Vansihing- This is more of a chant song and this totally through me off. But after a while, I was chanting along, and then making my own words. You kinda have to get use to it. 4/5 This song is not for everyone.<BR>6.A Stranger- One of the sleepest songs. I like it. Good lyrics and nice guitar melody. &quot;You're a stranger so.. what do I care&quot; 4/5<BR>7.The Outsider- Very cool. I like it when it picks up the pace, and then its on! &quot;Eveyone will have his day to die!&quot; which is true. 5/5<BR>8.Crimes- Nothing really happens in his song and its druming thats mainly it, if I had my way, I would have put his song first. I don't know why, it just seems right. 2/5<BR>9.The Nurse Who Loved Me- &quot;Say hello&quot; another sleepy one. I sing his when I'm alone, and its not too bad. No really guitar or drums in his one, but I enjoyed it. 4/5<BR>10.Pet- Nice and grunge like. This is song is ehh. 3/5<BR>11.Lullaby- Kinda weird. Ecoing voice, thats mainly it. 1/5<BR>12.Gravity- I don't like the fact that his song is last. I really like it, and its corus is nice. Also has a sleepy vibe to it again. 4/5
B00007G207|5.0|After reading all the reviews about new vs old, I think any warnings of good vs bad are a bit extreme. I watched both on a quiet Sunday afternoon 3 hours apart and although I beleive the old was a clearer fit tying his youth and mentor to the end of the cinema, the new version wasnt overwhelmingly distracting from the main story or &quot;old version&quot;.<br />All in all, the old still stands more solid evoking the same teary emotions from the primary story than the added &quot;all in one&quot; theme created by the interjection of the old girlfriend returns element reminiscent of the hollywood cliche. The new actually lessened the full intensity of experiences within the Cinema from the time he was a boy to his reminiscent return as a middle aged man.<br />I recommend the cleaner old version for the afficionados of non hollywood influenced movies.
B000002HJR|5.0|Let me start by saying I was never and will never be a Pantera fan. Don't know why but they just never clicked with me. I'm not much of a fan of Mr. Anselmo's either. He's quite the arrogant rockstar and I don't expect him to live another 10 years(not to be a jerk, just being honest. You could probably smoke the guy's clotted blood and get high). However, I'm a big fan of Corrosion of Conformity, and recently I've gotten into Eyehategod. Louisiana to me has always been a breeding ground for some of the finest music in America, from the New Orleans jazz of Satchmo and the foot-tapping funk of the Meters, to the heavier-than-hell Bayou dwellers such as Soilent Green and Acid Bath. Down, an underground supergroup, is a testament to a fine tradition.<br />NOLA is full of top-notch southern fried musicianship. Kicking back and listening to Stone the Crow, I can just imagine sitting on a porch, beer in hand and watching a sunset over a alligator-ruled swamp, mosquitos and reefer smoke lingering in the air. Pepper Keenan and Kirk Windstein(of Crowbar) provide great thick slabs of metal guitar which are as heavy as they are not foreign to the concept of melody either. In my mind, they are the real highlights of this band. The rhythm section is also formidable. Jimmy Bowers delivers some great beats. His real talent comes through on the second album, Bustle in Your Hedgegrow, which is not nearly as good as NOLA but still excellent in it's own right.<br />If you're tired of Three Doors Down and the Darkness being the only options for \\"straight ahead rock n' roll\\" in these rap metal and screamo-infested days, then please pick up this immensely satisfying and honest metal album.
B0001FGBL6|5.0|I'm going to tell you a little secret. I like metal music. No that's not the secret. Hell, you all already know that. My secret is that even though I like metal music, the guitar is not my favorite instrument. Oh like guitars just fine but in metal music it just goes with the territory. What really gets my attention is any and all of the following things augmenting and enhancing, even overpowering the guitars.<br />Give me choirs, pianos, organs, violins, bells, cellos and great female singing. This is why I like the music of Therion, Within Temptation, Nightwish and Edenbridge to name a few.<br />Enter, Epica!<br />Epica is good! Epica is very good! Epica is magnificent, Epica is, well....Epic! Epica is a breath of fresh air in this genre of music I like to think of as the new wave of metal music for the new millennium. Not really better but a little different.<br />This is a highly melodic symphonic composition reminiscent of a historical movie score. Beware! A couple songs have raspy male vocals.<br />I never thought anyone would top Within Temptation until fellow Dutch band Epica came along. I'm still not sure they have but it's close. Epica is a new Dutch band following in the footsteps of two Dutch giants - Within Temptation and After Forever. Founder Mark Jansen is very familiar with After Forever since he was one of their founding members and a former guitar player. He left A.F. citing artistic differences. Like W.T.and A.F., Epica plays Symphonic Metal with a female singer, Simone Simons whose voice is pleasant enough but doesn't seem to have the power of some of the other European divas.<br />Phantom Agony<br />The first thing I notice about this album is that it reminds my of a musical score for a historical movie. I can see myself turning down the sound and playing this album whilst watching The Highwayman or the Count of Monte Cristo, emoting romance, tragedy and adventure.<br />Phantom Agony is also reminiscent of Therion's recent efforts, which is another reason I like the CD, with the intrinsic use of a choir of two sopranos, two altos, a tenor and a bass and a small orchestra of three violins, two violas, two cellos and a contrabass. Occasionally heavy, but never hard, keyboards and the orchestra play a more sifnificant role on this album than the guitars and that's fine with me.<br />Song/Track list<br />1] Adyta (The Neverending Embrace) (1:26)****1/2<br />2] Sensorium (4:48)****1/2<br />3] Cry For The Moon [The Embrace That Smothers - Part IV] (6:44)*****<br />4] Feint (4:19)****<br />5] Illusive Consensus (5:00)****1/2<br />6] Facade Of Reality [The Embrace That Smothers - Part V] (8:12)*****<br />7] Run For A Fall (6:32)****1/2<br />8] Seif Al Din [The Embrace That Smothers - Part VI] (5:47)****1/2<br />9] The Phantom Agony (8:59)*****<br />10]The Phantom Agony (4:34)***** single version<br />Out of necessity all songs have a similar sound and feeling so I will describe the highlights.<br />\\"Cry For The Moon\\" (The Embrace That Smothers - Part IV)<br />the songs starts out with Simone and is taken over by the choir, which is magnificent. The middle contains faster drums with a clever mixture of soaring violins answered by the choir. There are some male growls but it feels like it's part of a story. This is an intriguing song.<br />\\"Facade Of Reality\\" (The Embrace That Smothers - Part V) bombastic guitar and violin laden sounds prevail. The pieces of Latin lyrics and dark grunts give this song an epic quality. Halfway through the song becomes much slower and cello and violins support Tony Blair commenting on terrorism after the events of September 11th. Thereafter the pace gets back to normal.<br />\\"Phantom Agony\\", the title tracks uses recurring refrain consisting of short violin notes, the choir, the bass guitar and bass drums throughout this 9 minute epic masterpiece. The whispering in the beginning and ending adds a nice touch. The last couple minutes of this song is a good example of how this album feels like a movie score.<br />\\"Phantom Agony\\" single version is a bonus track on the ltd edition. It's about half as long as the epic version.<br />Conclusion<br />If you are under the impression that I like this album, good for you, you got that right. Now that you're on a role, you need to check this out and at least see why I'm so impressed. Why? Because you don't want to get the most important thing wrong, do you?<br />Similar bands<br />Within Temptation, After Forever, Therion, Nightwish, Penumbra, Orkrist, Tristania, The Sins of Thy Beloved, Sireniaels like a movie score. <br />\\"Phantom Agony\\" single version is a bonus track on the ltd edition.

B00013F38K|5.0|Well done Warners.<BR>I've been comparing an episode recorded from TV (\\"Alethea\\" with Jodie Foster) with the new DVD release and yes the DVD release shows more of the image left and right of the 4:3 TV version.<br />I can't wait for season 2.
1572814349|5.0|If only I could give this deck 100 stars!!<br />The truth is, there just simply aren't enough wonderful adjectives to even come close to describing just how supremely delicious this deck really is...<br />Incredible collage work and design, rich extravagant colors and textures, superb packaging, gilded edges, the perfect size, perfect weight, an awesome book, a great price... Kat Black has created a certifiable masterpiece. <br />How such an incredible deck could be sold for so little is nothing short of astonishing. I would easily expect to pay twice as much for this deck, and had I done so, I would still not be disappointed.<br />These cards will absolutely sing to you with meaning and radiance. The love that Kat poured into this work is clearly evident on each and every card in this amazing deck. I have no doubt that new tarot decks will be measured against this deck for a long time to come.<br />If you buy just ONE tarot deck in your life, make it this one!<br />Well worth the nearly 2 years that many of us have been waiting to see this deck transformed to print.<br />Many, many, many kudos to Kat and US Games for absolutely the most beautiful tarot deck I have ever seen!! A wonderful deck, from a wonderful person. Bravo!
B00013F38K|5.0|I have been comparing again the epsiode \\"Aletha\\" on the DVD with the TV Version.<br />The DVD does show more of the image to the left and right for example another bar in Caine's jail cell.<BR>There is however slight cropping at the top and bottom of the image so it would indeed seem they have made these DVD's from the 35mm masters using a 16:9 frame rather than the original 4:3.<br />Also look out for the power pylon (on a hill side) in one of the early episodes while Caine is trying to calm a horse.
B00003CXXM|4.0|I enjoyed this.  It was good to see it brought into the 21st century, the 1988 Richard Chamberlain version did follow the book better but Matt Damon was pretty hot as the confused and memory challenged assassin Jason Bourne who wakes up on a ship with two bullet holes in his back and no memory of who he is or how he ended up in the middle of the ocean in a wet suit and a numbered Swiss Bank Account embedded in his hip.<br />Jason soon becomes aware that he is no ordinary man.  He speaks several languages fluently and he can kill silently and efficiently.  All of this adds to his confusion, and we are treated to a mad, frantic dash through the streets of various European Cities as Jason tries to remember who he is and what the word Treadstone means before he ends up on a slab in a morgue...<br />Franka Potente plays the young German woman who helps Jason find out who he is, she is pretty good as his love interest, being both brave and vulnerable in the same breath, you will probably remember her from \\"Run Lola Run\\" a quirky little film slightly reminiscent of the concept of \\"Sliding Doors\\" but with a sharper more violent edge.<br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is a fairly fast paced movie that is nothing like the book it is taken from which is a shame because the book is excellent; however this is a good little film in its own right.  Not one that I would have gone to the big screen to see but I do think it is worthy of a DVD and its one I would watch again and again just for the excellent fight scenes and great chases especially the first car chase with a battered mini and some fantastic stunt driving.<br />Enjoyable and very watchable in my opinion.
B000001EKX|5.0|Hotter than hell has the coolest album cover in history, and the sound of the album is the creepiest ever.<BR>The quality of the songs are maybe a little step down from the debut, but it's very little.<br />1. Got To Choose - Opens in great style. Kinda riffy and heavy. The high pitched chorus is very cool.<BR>2. Parasite - One of the best Kiss songs ever. Heavy. Riffmeister Frehley.<BR>3. Goin' Blind - Old Wicked Lester song rewritten for this album. It's one amazing song. Absolutely wonderful. Kinda like a ballad yet dark.<BR>4. Hotter Than Hell - This song is in the classic rock street. Simple and catchy. Gooood stuff.<BR>5.Let Me Go Rock 'n Roll - I would say this was Kiss' first anthem. I love it, but this version is just over two minutes, while live it's over five. The Alive! version smokes this version.<BR>6. All The Way - A forgotten jewel. Great anthemic chorus. Where did this Gene classic go?<BR>7. Watchin' You - Another true classic. Riff after riff. Everbody needs this song.<BR>8. Mailnline - A rootsy Rock'n roll track which Criss sings. Good song, but it is a little pale compared to other stuff here.<BR>9. Comin' Home - This is a memorable tune. Simple and to the point. <BR>10. Strange Ways - One Kiss' heaviest tracks. Heavy riff, great vocals and amazing Frehley soloing. Another forgotten gem.<br />Maybe not as classic as the debut, but it's a quality record with some forgotten great songs, plus this version of Goin' Blind is the one to get.
B00005JLYW|1.0|\\"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\\" is one of the most boring, mind-numbing, dim-witted and utterly pointless films I've seen all year.  Being a fan of the first film, I was first in line to see it.  I left the theater thoroughly disappointed.  All the freshness, cuteness, and, shall I say, \\"funness\\" that made the original so likable is gone.  And what is with Demi Moore?  She had about 10 minutes screen time yet somehow managed to become the \\"main attraction\\".  The woman is just so horribly smug, arrogant and downright vain that it shows in her performance and therefore made her insufferable to watch.  Hey, maybe that's a good thing seeing as how she was playing the villain and all.<br />Cameron, Lucy, and Drew are no longer charming and adorable as they were in the first film.  In \\"Full Throttle\\", they come off as obnoxious, slutty, and stupid.  I actually found myself rooting against the angels! :-O  Bill Murray does not reprise his role as Bosley and is instead replaced by Bernie Mac.  In my opinion, Murray's wit and lovable personality brought some much-needed humor to the original and without him; \\"Full Throttle\\" really lacks any actual humor.  In addition, the script/plot is silly and predictable, the action sequences are cartoonish and stale, and the special effects are tiresome.  The only positive thing I have to say about \\"Full Throttle\\" is that Justin Theroux has the most amazing six-pack I have ever seen.  Or was it an eight-pack?  A ten-pack maybe?
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan is the one must-see Star Trek movie, and by far the most accessible movie of the bunch to the casual viewer (with the possible exception of Star Trek IV, which was more an adventure-comedy than a Sci-Fi movie).  Conveniently, almost all Trek fans agree that it is the best of the bunch as well.  It captures the slam-bang fun potential of Star Trek better than just about anything else out there.  I will go even further, and say that STII is one of the best science fiction movies made, period.  It won't expand anybody's consciousness anytime soon, or serve as a substitute for science class, but it is great fun.<br />One surprising thing about this movie is how good it looks.  You would expect a 20-year-old science fiction movie to look like crap, but The Wrath of Khan actually looks very good.  This is doubly surprising when you consider that the budget of the movie was relatively small, and some of the effects shots were (cleverly) recycled from the even older Star Trek: The Motion Picture.<br />The acting is good as well.  Although most non-Trekkies wouldn't consider Shatner, Nimoy, et. al. to be master thespians, director Nicholas Meyer gets credible performances from them.  Any over-acting is strictly for fun here, not groans.  Special kudos need to be given to Ricardo Montalban, who does a great job playing the over-the-top villain, Khan.  Not to mention his personal trainer; apparently his pecs are real, not a prop as was once rumored.<br />Not something I usually comment on, but the soundtrack is outstanding as well.  It does a great job of setting and enhancing the moods in the various scenes.  I particularly liked the main theme from the introduction.<br />The DVD package is EXTREMELY good, with lots of extras that are actually interesting to watch.  I've found that most commentary soundtracks are just a waste of time, but director Nick Meyer's commentary is actually interesting and entertaining.  He sounds like a very smart, funny guy, making it easy to see why many people think he \\"saved\\" the Star Trek movie franchise after the bloated mess of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  Not coincidentally, he also played a big role in the other two Star Trek movies that are actually worth watching: Star Trek IV (which, in spite of the silly \\"save-the-whales\\" message was an excellent sci-fi comedy), and Star Trek VI (a fun combination sci-fi/trial/jailbreak/mystery/action movie).  There are also tons of interviews, making-of featurettes, and that sort of thing.<br />The Director's Cut (the only version of the movie included) is only slightly tweaked from the original theatrical release, and is slightly better all-around as a result.  Fans who saw the old version probably won't notice the difference, however.  Sound and picture quality are top-notch, especially given the age of the source material.<br />Unless you can't stand anything even remotely science-fiction, Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan is a great movie, and the 2 DVD Director's Edition is by far the best version available.  It is also priced like most single-DVD sets, making it a great value.

B00003CXTG|2.0|Pearl Harbor is a film that got a lot of hype at first and then got tons of criticism in the end.  Despite what I heard and read about Pearl Harbor being a big flop and disappointment I saw it and found the majority of the criticism to be founded.  It's not so much I think the film is a disgrace to the men and women who were at Pearl Harbor over sixty years ago or that it's an embarrassment to our veterans.  I just think it was a disappointing story in a fascinating yet tragic time in American history.<br />Everyone knows the plot by now: two boys grow up together and fall in love later on with the same gal.  The stereotypical love triangle: love vs. friendship.  So the love story is nothing new, nothing great, been done before hundreds of different times.  The director knew this and thought he could pull a fast one by taking this over used script and just incorporate it in tragic period.  This was the mistake of the film.  The movie isn't about Pearl Harbor, December 7th, or the start of WWII.  It's about a love story that includes famous events such as the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Doolittle raids.<br />The film is titled Pearl Harbor so I think most people that went to see it thought that's what it was going to be about because that's what it's titled.  After the movie, we all feel confused over what the movie is about because Pearl Harbor is just the backdrop and the real story is about something we know all too well about: the love triangle.  This is highly disappointing.  If we want to see this kind of romance we'll go see a romance film that we know is going to be about romance.  Pearl Harbor shouldn't be about two fly boys sharing the love of a nurse.  I anticipated it to be about something similar to Tora Tora Tora only to have more centralized characters.<br />Now, even though the plot doesn't match the title and the romance is way too predictable and stereotypical to begin with, what ruins this movie is how much the movie is dedicated to the romance.  The film is over three hours long.  Close to two hours of it is donated to the romance story.  Not to mention the romance seems to cut in and out of serious events.  One minute Roosevelt is talking to his cabinet, the next Hartnett and Beckinsale are swimming together.  One minute Affleck is writing to Beckinsale about how much he loves her the next scene shows the Japanese going over how to attack Pearl Harbor.  What's happening is two different stories that are trying to be woven together at the same time and it doesn't quite work because one is interesting while the other is boring.  And the one that is boring gets the majority of screen time.<br />The acting in the film is something else to be desired.  I'm just totally disappointed to how the Japanese high command is painted.  They act as if they're reading lines rather than portraying real life Japanese admirals.  Such as Yamamoto's line: \\"I fear all we have done is awoken a sleeping giant..etc.\\"  He says it so quick and without meaning, it had little effect to the viewers, when the quote itself means quite a bit.  <br />I'm disappointed because from a story viewpoint this isn't original.  Not even close.  It's highly predictable and disinteresting.  The special effects are great, the action sequences are well done, but none of that matters if it has a weak storyline.  We wanted to see a movie about Pearl Harbor the events that led up to the attack, the attack itself, and its aftermath.  We didn't want to see this stupid love triangle that dominated the movie while the day of infamy is nothing more but a stage for it.<br />I think this story would've been a box office success and smash hit among viewers abroad if it wasn't titled \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  It deserves a different title because its story does not correlate with the events.  It's really too bad because the film had plenty of potential but it was mis-used in the form of cheezy romance that we can find in any other movie.  Pearl Harbor gave the impression that it was supposed to be a special film not a high budget movie with an ordinary plot.  But that's what Pearl Harbor is: just plain ordinary.<br />Grade: C-
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I really don't understand why people catogorize Godsmack as nu-metal.  In my opinion, bands like Linkin Park belong in that catagory.  This is pure hard rock.  Godsmack is very reminiscant of the early 90s grunge but they make that sound a bit heavier.  Their name is from an Alice in Chains song which shows you where they got much of their influence.  I think the nu-metal tag has been over-used ang tagged on to bands that don't fit in with the rest of that sound.  New metal is supposed to be rap/rack but I have never heard rap out of Godsmack or many of the other bands that are described as nu-metal.  Well I don't know where I'm going with this review anymore but if you want pure hard rock, then I highly recommend this album.  Have fun and play it loud.
0789723107|5.0|I work for a small business that constantly redesigns our websites because management, marketing and development can't decide on a single aspect of our website.  Everyone thinks their own ideas are the fruit of eden so all we do is talk in circles for hours on end.  I found this book very helpful (especially with the political problems within my company) because it cuts out the &quot;I think blah blah is best because I'm the coolest person in the world and my opinions are better than yours&quot; and gets you focused on &quot;this is what works best because it actually works for real people&quot;.  This book can give you actual support behind your opinions in a meeting about a website because everything is based on usability.  Web navigation, layout, instructions and concise content are a few examples of topics covered.<br />My favorite quote of the book is: &quot;Happy talk must die.&quot;  I absolutely worship this short section of the book in which Steve Krug explains how happy balk is like a voice in the back of your head saying &quot;blah blah blah blah blah...&quot;  Seriously, maybe 80% of my company's website is this BS &quot;happy talk&quot; which has no relevant content or beef to helping our customers or selling our own products.  Happy talk is superfluous babble that wastes time and confuses and frustrates web users.<br />All in all, I think this is a great read (I think it took me about 2 1/2 hours)  I recommend it for web designers and web project managers, as well as other individuals that have a large personal stake in a website.  I am starting my own company with is heaviliy web-based, and I will be applying many of the topics in this book toward it.<br />My ownly caveat is that this book is a bit brief - although the author appeared to have written it this way.  I would have liked more information on navigation and examples on service-based industries where companies try to sell solutions to customers rather than physical products.

B000127LW2|1.0|I am a huge Star Trek fan and I consider Voyager a worthy part of the Star Trek universe. While the first season cannot compare to later seasons, I still found it very interesting and enjoyable. Anyone who considers themselves a serious trekkie must include Voyager in their collection.<br />My reason for giving this one star is because of its appalling presentation. Sadly again, Paramount has let its US fans down in terms of the design of the boxsets as well as the discs themselves. The discs have absolutely no design printed on it. It's just a plain disc. The boxset while it's an improvement from those of the cardboard types for TNG, is still a far cry from the plastic boxsets from the UK version. Furthermore, there is no pamphlet included in the boxset unlike those of the TNG version.
0312995423|3.0|I read Brown's other books (Angels and Demons, The Da Vinci Code and Deception Point), and liked them all despite many flaws and the fact that they were all incredibly similar in plot development and characterizations.  This book was pretty much like those, but I didn't like it as much.<br />There were so many unbelievable situations in this story, including the premise that the book is based on, that they were harder to ignore than in the other books.  Brown once again manages to make a ridiculous story readable and entertaining, however, which is why I gave the book 3 stars.<br />I don't know if Brown just doesn't have any other ideas, or if he is just trying to stick with what works, but I really wish I could see a different plot from him.  As it is, if he comes out with anything else, I'll make sure to read the reviews first, because if it's anything like his other books, I think I'm about burnt out on the one plot that he has come up with so far.
B00003Q438|1.0|very lame, just another james cameron girl power movie and not too realistic.
B00008H2LB|4.0|linkin park has always had their own style of music.. hybrid theory was definatly an amazing cd and you could feel what they were talking about. meteora is the same way. if you liked hybrid theory for the lyrics and not just how hardcore they were, then odds are you will probably like meteora also. I highly recomend meteora, all the songs on the album show plenty of emotion and everyone can relate it to whatever may be going on in their lives. personally this album saved my life. so i think it is worth the money and so much more.

B000065V9Y|1.0|Having been at one time obsessed with 1980s commercial music, I was rather late in buying Peter Gabriel's \\"Us\\" given the amount I used to listen to his 1986 singles like \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\". \\"Us\\" had received, it is true, some rather ordinary reviews in such magazines as Rolling Stone and among books like MusicHound, but I still felt in certain moods a little guilty of not owning the record when I had bought a great many less critically favoured ones.<br /><br />I had known well of the despairing singles \\"Steam\\" and \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" for many years beforehand for the simple reason of their being played a great deal on classic rock radio in my native Australia.<br /><br />However, it must be said that the singles - tearful and neither by any means easy to listen to nor possessing amazing vocal or emotional qualities - are totally unrepresentative of the rest of \\"Us\\". Nevertheless, the rest of \\"Us\\" really is despairingly slow and shallow. The remaining songs basically consist of seemingly exotic rhythms carried through a slow, meandering synthesiser that never succeeds in having any impact upon a listener even if (s)he listens really closely. Rather, the songs typify what the eccentric Joe S. Harrington calls \\"world muzak\\" with their almost new-age type feel - they move less than anything I have heard from Enya.<br /><br />Gabriel's lyrics appear to be analysis of a type so distant from a listener that one wonders if he really is not a professional scientist dealing with music. On earlier singles, he at least gave some impression of feeling - something \\"Us\\" never even dabbles in.<br /><br />On the whole, it is a pity I did not follow the advise of the sceptics about this album - but I rarely do if I think I MIGHT like something. To be avoided.
0385504209|3.0|A comparison of this novel with the Hardy Boys is meant to be descriptive, not pejorative.  When I was 10 or 11 years old I used to love diving into a new Hardy Boys mystery and it was with some regret that when I reached the age of 13 the books no longer worked for me.  (The regret lasted only until I discovered Science Fiction -Heinlein, Asimov, Clarke, Simak, Norton, etc.)  Starting with the colourful cover, the Hardy Boys porovided action, mystery, suspense -these were juveniles succeeding in an adult world.  My God, they could even drive!  And imagine having a father who was a detective.  I would lose myself for hours in their black and white world of smart, energetic teen-agers and bad guys with foreign accents and five o'clock shadows.<br />'The Da Vinci Code' is the second Dan Brown book I have read (I read 'Angels and Demons' last year.) Both books are packed with fascinating, little known facts and interesting, if far out, theories about intriguing subjects.  The writing is clunky, even risible in places.  The characters are one dimensional and absolutely cartoonish at times.  The plot twists are outrageous, occasionally bordering on the ridiculous.  The action is breakneck and nobody in a Dan Brown book seems to ever sleep.  And yet it all works in its own way.<br />Here are some negatives that a potential reader might want to know about:<br />-paper-thin, cliched characters.<br />-barely readable writing style -I've never read a book where so many people 'chuckled' or where jaws were so prone to dropping.<br />-grandiose, Agatha Christie-like plot turns.<br />-loose, somewhat unsatisfying ending -perhaps setting things up for a sequel.<br />On the positive side:<br />-interesting, surprising facts about all sorts of things (e.g. Christ's divinity was voted upon at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD.  Until then a majority of Christians thought of Christ as a divinely inspired prophet, but still a human being.)  Brown stimulates thought on any number of intriguing topics.  He challenges what you thought you knew while providing fascinating snippets of new information.  Some of this information seems to be stretched and sensationalized at times, but I don't think there are any fabrications or any intent to mislead.<br />-well-described, exotic European buildings and locations.  Brown is at his best describing ancient buildings and famous works of art.<br />-furious action and multiple points of view.<br />-there is no padding.  Some writers would have dragged out this book for another 200 pages.<br />-there is violence but no gratuitous violence.  There is no sex, gratuitous or otherwise, which I suppose could have also have been listed as a negative.  Nevertheless it is refreshing to read a best-selling author who doesn't feel he has to put in a minimum quota of sex to fulfill a mundane expectation.<br />-reading 'The Da Vinci Code' makes you want to travel and see the art and locations described within.<br />Brwon speculates a lot, but with the topics under consideration there is a lot of room for speculation.  Hard, uncontestable facts about early Christianity, the Templars, medieval secret societies, and the inner intrigues of the Catholic church are not easy to come by. Brown does his readers a service by questioning long accepted ideas and challenging one to re-examine what you thought you knew about the rise of Christianity.  The idea that the Roman Empire didn't really fall but only morphed into the monolithic, imperialistic Catholic Church is not new (see P.K. Dick's 'Valis') but it is an important concept that deserves more consideration, and it will be a new idea to a lot of Brown's huge readership.  The fact that the four gospels, which so many Christians take for the last word about events that happened 2000 years ago, were only a small fraction of what was extant at the time the 'authorized version' was approved about 1700 years ago will also be new to many readers (read 'The Unauthorized Version' byRobin Lane Fox), as will the role of the Catholic church in deliberately suppressing all points of view not in strict accordance with its rigid dogma.  It wasn't just millions of people who were tortured, slaughtered, and erased from history when the Manichaeans, Gnostics, Bogomils, Cathars and so-called witches were wiped out, it was also ideas that were killed.  Often the only way facts about some of these ideas, movements, and people can be reconstituted is by studying extant church polemics against them (see 'Encyclopedia of Heresies and Heretics' by Leonard George.)<br />While far from being a work of art, 'The Da Vinci Code' is a good bit of escapist fun which touches on important questions of history and theology, and I look forward to reading Brown's next book., as will the role of the Catholic church in deliberately suppressing all points of view not in strict accordance with its rigid dogma.

0064407667|4.0|I can't believe some of the people who have read this book think that kids won't understand the humor in it.  The plot was a bit weak (hence the 4 stars) but it wasn't that bad...I read it in about 30 minutes before mailing it to my younger cousin for Christmas.  I liked it enough to quote a few lines to my parents (mostly the sarcast definitions of words) and didn't feel it was too dangerous for a 9-year-old to read. The people who are writing in reviews of this book that talk about how inappropriate and damaging a book like this is should take a look at the traditional fairy tales that kids like so much...I mean, as a little kid, (I'm 21) I loved the original version of Cinderella way more than the Disney version. Plus, sugar-coating reality (like abuse and mistreatment) doesn't make it not exist, and kids should recognise that many of the things that happen to the characters in the books are wrong and shouldn't happen to anyone. You could even use some of the topics to start a line of dialogue with your kids about such themes.  All together, a good book...though overrated and much over-feared.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|\\"In the Zone\\" is probably the wqorst album of the past year. Tired techno with some hip hop thrown in the mix, and Britney's cracking voice through it all. In some songs she sounds like a computer recording because they've mixed her voice through computers so much.<br />The worst thing is that she tries to shock us with this album. As if kissing Madonna weren't enough, now she sings about her sex drive, her shopping, bumping and grinding with boys and her \\"boom boom.\\" She even sings about masturbating. It isn't shocking, because everybody else has done it first. Heard of the Divinyls? They did a better song about \\"touching myself.\\"<br />Oh, and I notice that a lot of recent positive reviews for this are by the gushing \\"music fan\\" who keeps posting anonymous reviews. Sometimes it's just one posted after the other. a lot of them were posted after la_solinas's intelligent review (she said it better than I ever could). Hmm.
B00005JN1L|2.0|STORY: I'm starting to think that Stephen King's only motivation for writing now days is so he can cash in on the movie adaptions of his work. The past few movies based on his works have been duds, including this one. Honestly, the only good Stephen King movie was The Shining. In this movie Johnny Depp plays a writer who is having trouble starting his new work of fiction, and to add into the mix he is going through a divorce, which is only there in the plot so the ending can be what it is. One day a tall southern man dressed in black comes by and accuses Mort (Depp) for plagerizing a story of his. The man's name is John Shooter. As the story progresses things start to become more serious with Shooter, and basically that's it for the story until the mildly shocking end. I was mad when I saw the ending (people who know the plot of my script will know why), but don't get me wrong it's a good ending it's just that I thought of it first (Okay, fine, maybe King did publish it before I wrote it down last year). Anyway, the only problem with the ending is that the \\"idea\\" is good except the effect is a stinker. The audience will ask at the end of the movie \\"Okay, now what? Why did I sit through this entire thing?\\" There is no reason behind the motive, there is really no message to the movie, and usually psychological thrillers have those. This comes across as a thriller without a brain, no smarts included. The movie also contains no jump out of your seat moments, it does however have two or three scenes that will get the heart pumping a bit, but no jumps. Overall a bad movie with a good out of place ending that leaves the audience saying \\"So What?!\\"<br />ACTING: This is a one man show here. Like Colin Ferrel in Phone Booth. Without Johnny Depp this movie would be a crapstaviganza.  The only thing is that Depp's approach to the role gives some comedic moments to the film, and at some points that changes the tone of the movie, which in the end does not make the story run smoothly. I know why they did it though, because without Depp's comedic charisma this movie would be extremely borring, EXTREMELY!<br />BOTTOM LINE: The movie is a stinker, no doubt about it. The name Stephen King used to hold attention at the movies with such classics as The Shining and Pet Cemetery. Now we have Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital on TV and Secret Window in the movies. Icky Poo! The ending is good but can be seen a mile away and is very out of place in a movie like this, David Koepp who penned the screenplay did not do a very good job of building a \\"shocker\\". If you have a bunch of people in the audience saying \\"I knew it!\\", then that's a good sign that your movie failed to deliver.hly.

B00004WLXZ|5.0|An absolute master piece.  Whether you love the Third Reich or hate it, you can't help but be an awe of this movie.  Leni Riefenstahl does a great job of capturing the image that Hitler was trying to get across.  That of a rebirth of Germany and the German people.  You get a good look at how much the people loved Hitler, and realize that they were going to follow him to hell if he asked them to.  <BR>The only complaint I have is with the translation in this edition.  It seems that the first version of T of W on DVD did a better job of translating German to English.  Some things lost in the translation in the Special Edition.  But still a great documentary.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|if you like pop music, i can guarantee 150% that you'll enjoy this album.  there's so many different styles and sounds represented that you'll be sure to find something that appeals to you.  every song is fresh and creative, especially touch of my hand, toxic, and breathe on me.  disregard the biased reviews and give this album a listen.  once you do so, i guarantee you'll be impressed!
B000008GHW|5.0|I can't believe this album is out of &quot;print&quot;! This was released shortly<br />after JH's death and I consider it a natural and organic extension of<br />his studio albums with excellent mix &amp; sound quality. Truly a gem,<br />and a definite 5 stars!
006054094X|5.0|Frist, hats off to Mr. Menzies! You are great! As a non-Chinese, you spent 14 precious years and your own money to investigate and gather evidence in order to find the truth and also give credits to Chinese Zheng He. If someday, it proves that Zheng He is the first one to discover America, you should be remembered and respected by every Chinese as well as Zheng He.<BR>I saw this paperback book in the book store and then realized this is the same book that somebody mentioned to me last year(but I totally ignored his comments on this book). I immidately took it and started to read it. Since opening the first a few pages, I couldn't put it down! I am a Chinese and never really into history before. At first, I did not think it would hook me, but it did. Zhen He is well known in China. Every Chinese heard about him, and knew that he had Xia Xi Yang(went westward ocean) seven times. But that's it, we don't know where exactly he went to, what he brought back from his trip. Most of his records were destoried like Mr. Menzies mentioned in the book. It seems does not make sense to non-Chinese people that Zheng He(not Christopher Columbus)discovered American. But if you think about, just like Mr. Menzies mentioned in the book, even 70 years after Zheng He's vast fleet explored the world, the ocean was still unknown to European explorers, not only unknown, but fears were also among people in those years. When I was a little child, I had read lots of Greek and Roman myth. I had read many stories of Greek myth about seamen took ocean trip and met serpent or nymphs such as the famous Greek myth &quot;the adventures of Ulysses&quot;. Ulysses had to put wax into his ears to avoid hearing song sang by nymphs. If mariners heard their songs, they were impelled to cast themseleves into the sea to destruction. I have read quite a lot of these kind of scared stories. But if you read Chinese myth or folk stories. There is no such kind of scared stories at all. You only hear good stories about the sea creatures. For example, a shell changed to a beautiful girl during the day and help a poor boy to cook and sew and later became the boy's wife and lived happyly ever after. I am wondering, if Christopher Columbus(or Portuguese) had no map beforehand, had no big ships compared to Zheng He's fleet, and also was very superstition, if he could still went his great voyage successfully and returned home safely, that's really a big miracle!!! <BR>Based on Ming China's power and richness, it does make sense only China had the ability to draw the map. But it would be very difficult for Mr. Menzies(or anybody) to prove it because Zheng He's voyage were not documentated(or destoried). Everybody believe that Columbus discovered American because he documentated! <BR>I wish Mr. Menzies and anybody who can help him to gather more proof to work on this together. Again, thanks so much, Mr. Menzies. Keep up your good work. You deserve respect from all Chinese people.
B00001MXXH|5.0|I went to Wal-Mart looking for a cheap DVD with only $12. I found two DVDs for $9.44 a piece. They were Black Sheep and Ferris Bueller. Since I had already seen Black Sheep(which is a great movie also)I bought Ferris Bueller. I started watching it and I wasn't expecting one of the best movie I have ever seen. But that is exactly what I got. I highly recommend buying this movie for the movie, not the &quot;special feature&quot;. The special feature is commentary with the director, I think they could've thought of something better than that. Oh, well this movie is still awsome.
0385504209|1.0|Did you know that Lincoln's secretarys name was Kennedy and that Kennedy's secretarys name was Lincoln?  A strange and then  intriguing fact brought to my attention some 40 years ago by an interesting girl in my 7th grade gym class.  What does it mean, you ask?  Absolutely nothing.<br />Dan Brown attempts to make something out of nothing here by stringing together coincidence, half-baked \\"theories\\" and outright fabrication.  I'm sure in his clever, mercenary hands the Lincoln/Kennedy co-winky-dink could have our constitution and democratic process hanging by a thread.<br />The writing is woefully mediocre, the characters are cartoonish, one dimensional and not very bright. The ending is anti-climactic and not in a good way.<br />Read it if you must as I did for my book group, but keep in mind that grain of homely table salt.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I can't seem to put into words how amazing this CD is. I was blown away by APC's first album, Mer De Noms, but The Thirteenth Step outshines it by far. I bought this CD a month and a half ago and I can honestly say I have listened to it at least for at least a few minutes, or more likely hours, everyday. It is the kind of music that you can listen to over and over again and never tire of it. Undeniably the best song on the CD is &quot;The Noose.&quot; A Perfect Circle has a unique sound and doesn't sound like all the other sell-out rock bands today. Their lyrics are often dark and there are different songs to accompany any mood. A Perfect Circle really establishes new, higher standards for artists today. Buy this CD today and if you are a fan of REAL music, you will not regret it!
B000002U82|5.0|I was 3 years old the first time I heard this album. I am 32 now. I still love it. I remember listening to it as a child, and being captivated by the album cover, and wondering what the lyrics meant, particularly 'Us and Them'....it was my moms record. She loved it too. As a teenager, I listened to this album from time to time, and realized how much it had woven its way into my musical influences, and I started to see what some of the words meant, albeit in an adolescent sort of way. Different songs became favorites at different times. It was always a companion - something to take me back to being three years old, and being captivated by its magic so early in my life. In my twenties, the weight of the lyrics began to astound me, as I realized that 'ten years had got behind me' and that what Waters had written about resonated with me in a way very few if any albums had. I have just listened to the album once more - the same copy my mom owned when I was very small. It is likely that I will never tire of this album, even if I only give it a proper listen once a year or so. Each time is like the first, each listen revealing something new and creating a sense of serene wonder, and nostalgic sadness, as the words and music found in it seem to do so gracefully. It is very hard for me to imagine what it would be like to hear this album for the first time now...I expect that like all great and timeless recordings, it will affect each listener regardless of age, as it encompasses words, music and production to near perfection. My tastes in music over the years have run the gamut from indie rock, to electronic, to ambient, to experimental - it could be said that Dark Side of the Moon is the perfect encapsulation of all of these disparate styles. A masterpiece.
B000002J09|5.0|When you hear the words Led Zeppelin, Stairway To Heaven is probably one of the first things that comes to mind. This album has the big hits Stairway To Heaven, Black Dog, Rock And Roll. However unlike other albums with huge hits, not one song overshadows another. This album is one of the most consistent albums I've ever heard. Every song flows perfectly into one another, giving this album a very even feel. Led Zeppelin's 4th album is also very versitile, ranging from acoustic songs(Going To California, Stairway To Heaven) to hard rocking songs(Black Dog, Rock And Roll, Misty Mountain Hop) Four Sticks is another interesting song. Its a hard rock song but at the same time its folky and somewhat experimental. John Bonham plays with four drum sticks on this song so thats how it got its name. Robert Plant sings great vocals with Sandy Denny on The Battle Of Evermore, which is the folkiest song on the album. The closing song on the disc is When The Levee Breaks. 100% pure electric blues. This is the heaviest, darkest song on the album with Bonham's echoeing drum beats that sound really heavy, it sound like he's using tree trunks rather than sticks. This album is the height of Zep's myticism and tolkien fantasies. In short this is one of the best rock albums created and has sold 22 million copies since 1971 for good reason.
B00018D44U|1.0|It amazes me how many people are duped into believing this is enyjoyable listenable music - Norah has a whispery souless voice that neither grabs you or draws you in - it gives elevator schlock a bad name - go discover Joss Stone - The Soul Sessions - or revist Shelby Lynne - I am Shelby Lynn - or better yet - Dusty Springfield - Dusty In Memphis - the ultimate country/soul album by a female singer ever - - <BR>and while I have your attention - why is Robbie Williams not big in the States??!!
B00005B36H|5.0|I wont dribble on. I'll just say it is impossible to tell you how brilliant this album and all of Tool's previous work is. They are geniuses. I would give it 20 stars but I cant...
B000002BQK|5.0|This album &quot;butterfly&quot; is still the best album from Mariah and should be in everybody's music/CD collection by now. Best songs found on here are &quot;honey,&quot; &quot;butterfly,&quot; &quot;whenever you call,&quot; &quot;fourth of july&quot; and &quot;as I close my eyes.&quot; No other female artist can compare or touch Mariah's powerful voice.
B00008OWZC|5.0|These two concerts at the LA Forum and Long Beach Arena in 1972 represent Led Zeppelin with more energy than on The Song Remains The Same. Dazed and Confused clocks in at over 25 minutes long and the Whole Lotta Love medley is over 23 minutes. Page's guitar licks and solos are awesome and Robert Plant's voice is in great shape. Check out the opening Immigrant Song. It is double the length of the album version and has a big extended solo for the extra heavy effect. Overall this is the perfect document of Led Zeppelin live along with the new dvd released last year. Unfortunatley this is likely to be the last live Zeppelin release but it sure is a hell of a good one.
073930464X|3.0|A decent story but too wordy and full of itself.  I found myself wondering about this book when I wasn't reading it but when I picked it up, it was predictible and left too many ends dangling.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Lots of special eefect, women in sexy outfits and Arnolds dumb one-liners. I actually slow in some parts. No fun at all.
1557280290|5.0|In this remarkable, overlooked work, John Williams chooses as his central character an undistinguished English professor (Stoner), who lives a largely uneventful life teaching at a drab Midwestern university. Neither Stoner's wife, nor his colleagues, nor his students think much of him.  Yet the degree to which Williams succeeds in bringing the reader to identify with -- and care for -- his most unlikely protagonist is nothing short of a triumph.  The final pages, in particular, are sad, transcendent, and unforgettable.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I was impressed with the sophistication of the production and arrangements of the songs most of all.  He's got a pleasant and somewhat unique voice but after a while it sounds as if all the songs are in the same key and I get weary of his &quot;inflections&quot; on every tune.  But I gotta give the kid a lot of slack.  For a first album this one is damn good.  The man has some excellent guitar chops, though he sounds like he may be capable of much more in that area than he displays here.  I haven't heard his second cd yet so perhaps he's thrown some curves into his style since putting out this one.  I hope so.  He's the kind of artist that gives me a glimmer of hope for the future of music.

No other album, ever, including Suicides' others, sounds like this. A totally compelling, unique and unsettling album, from start to finish!
0385504209|4.0|I'm not a big conspiracy theorist and I'm sure that Brown takes some liberties with his source material (this is a novel after all) but all in all I was fascinated with this book.  I read it from start to finish in 2-1/2 days and just couldn't put it down!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Another excellent hip-hop album from recent months.  Following the successes of Outkast's &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,&quot; which was the best album of 2003, Kanye West's &quot;The College Dropout&quot; proves that hip-hop is the most vital musical form of the 2000s.  It's top notch,with highlights including All Falls Down, Jesus Walks, Never Let Me Down, Slow Jamz, and Through the Wire...but really almost all of it is terrific (the skits are so-so, but fit the spirit of the album).  I can't wait to see what the genre produces next, but until then &quot;The College Droput&quot; serves as a an example of a young artist beginning what will be a wonderful solo career and as just a very enjoyable album.
B00013RC9I|5.0|What can you say, an overall brilliant cd with no weak tracks. But, if i have to choose a top three from this one it would be (in the following order with the highest first):<BR>Cherry Blossom girl (cant get it out of my head!,)Alone in Kyoto (hyper elegant track, also featured in the movie Lost in translation) and Surfing on a rocket (also hard to get out of my head...). <br />I was a average fan of their moon safari album so I was very surprised (and pleased) when I heard this one. <br />So, if you choose between Talkie walkie and Moon Safari, I definetly recommend you to pick Talkie walkie.
B00003CXFG|4.0|I'm finally writing this review after having owned this film on DVD since December of 2000! (Wow, has it really been over 4 years already???) To be honest, I first saw PITCH BLACK (2000) in the theater after having been so intrigued by the teaser/trailer shown on TV--and I didn't like it back then. At the time, I found the visuals too muddy and the characters too broadly stroked and one-dimensional. I mentally rated the film two stars out of five (I never officially reviewed the theater version on here). Indeed, the only thing that saved this film from a one-star rating was the surprising, star-making performance of Vin Diesel as convicted murderer and prisoner Richard B. Riddick; he ended up being the only character that I had found interesting! <br />Well, I had a change-of-heart when PITCH BLACK came out on DVD. The more I remembered the movie, the more aspects of it I liked; plus, I had a feeling that it would end up being like THE MATRIX, which looks much better on DVD that it ever did in the theater. I don't know why I thought so, but I had a strong feeling about that. My instincts were correct: I played the DVD soon after having received it for the holidays, and it just completely rocked! For some reason, everything that I found disjointed on the big screen just totally came together on the small screen. Plus, we had just bought and installed a Surround Sound system for the first time, and I believe that PITCH BLACK was the first DVD we played on it. Oh man, what an experience! This film is ten times creepier with Surround Sound--it's truly amazing. <br />If you didn't already know by now, PITCH BLACK is a Sci-Fi Horror chiller dealing with a small band of military space travelers, who are looking for a new planet to colonize and on which to incarcerate the dangerous Riddick. Australian actress Radha Mitchell (this film was shot in the Australian desert) plays Carolyn Fry, who becomes commander when an unfortunate accident kills the previous leader and causesthe spacecraft to crash-land on this seemingly barren planet. Having been content playing second-fiddle for a long time and being clearly uncomfortable with her new role, Fry must learn how to lead this ragtag band, which includes, among others, William J. Johns as the macho, Rambo-like, self-proclaimed hero (Cole Hauser), a devoted Muslim (Keith David) and his two young sons, a scrappy teenage tomboy (Rhianna Griffith) and the aforementioned Riddick. As Fry sets out to seek life on this sun-scorched desert planet, with Johns challenging her every step of the way, the enigmatic and unpredictable Riddick escapes. Just as they begin to discover the truth about this ultra-bright planet served by three suns, things suddenly take a dark turn for the worse as the natural order of things begins to change--in the form of an extremely rare triple-solar eclipse. It is then that this group find the danger lurking within the planet--the hard way. <br />This film is very sharply shot (and looks really incredible on an HDTV screen), with alternately red and blue camera filters which make us feel the extreme differences in conditions faced by these characters. This DVD offers some really tasty extras including commentary tracks by director David Twohy and stars Diesel &amp; Hauser; however, the four-and-a-half minute &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette is disappointingly short. All-in-all, PITCH BLACK, with its plot holes &amp; all, is an extremely entertaining movie that is best watched in the type of conditions described by the title, and--of course--it certainly helps to have Surround Sound and to turn it up! <br />RECOMMENDED<BR>(HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR HORROR/SCIFI FANS!)
B000089RVX|2.0|its really not that good, and im not one of those people who hates something just cuz the band peoples are posers, its truly bad attempted music, and the singer cant even sing, <BR>YEP, evanescence sounds like a good idea but once you here it its just like, oh wow...that was pointless<br />this band can go in the crap pile along with avril and limp bizkit
0385504209|3.0|I don't have much time to read but managed to make it through this book. I like my books simple and this book is as simple as you are going to get. It dragged in a few spots, but all of the symbolism and the secret society references were intriguing.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I really enjoyed watching &quot;Big.&quot; It stars two of my fav.<BR> actors: Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins. Tom Hanks is really<BR> great as the young boy &quot;trapped&quot; in a mans body. Elizabeth<BR> Perkins is soooo cute as Hanks love interest and also a great<BR> actress. As I wrote,a great movie!!!
B000006TRV|4.0|Ah yes, The Wall. This, along with Dark Side Of The Moon, are what Pink Floyd are renowned for. These are possibly the two biggest sellers in the catalogue. <br />You all know about this album so I won't go on any further with the history of the album. I like the album, not as much as some of the others I have but I wouldn't term it as Pink Floyd's best! Still the songs are good and they do generally blend in well with the concept at hand, ie. they tell perfectly Roger's problems dealing with being a rock star and again bits and pieces of Syd come into his thoughts. Whether how much of this is true I don't know ( that being the lyrical content). I like Another Brick....and Don't Leave Me Now although if I had have known it was about a rock star who wants his girl back so he can abuse her again I'm not quite sure if I'd have liked it - I just thought it was about being lonely - that's all!<br />But anyway - this is The Wall and if you can get by it you're already on your way to enjoying the album. Oh yes and this seems to be an inspiration to many of today's rock stars. That I think could be a bad thing as well as a good thing but that's all I should say
0385504209|2.0|This book was average, at best. It was so hyped- I was prepared to read a great mystery. It failed on three counts: 1) the suspense: The mystery thread of the book was sophomoric at best. I was solving the codes well before the &quot;symbologist&quot; and &quot;code breaker&quot; were cluing in... it was obvious where the book was going- no suspense. 2) The writing: sophomoric as well. Dan's writing style is very simple- I guess to reach a broader audience? For those who read a lot and appreciate good writing, reading this book was slightly painful. 3) The &quot;religious&quot; aspect: regardless of what you believe, his &quot;facts&quot; and the way he presents them are so flimsy and vague. I would question anyone who said this book changed their life or made them question their faith. Really? Come on now... anyone that reads this book with any discernment can see through his facts that stretch miles to link up to equally vague facts. Chalk it up to fiction.<br />I only give this book two stars because it appears this guy did some research and if nothing else, will prompt the reader to do a little research of their own.  Don't waste your time and money.  Or at least buy it used if you must.
B00009W0U4|4.0|This movie was very difficult to watch.  I don't think that I have ever seen a more violent opening seen or quite as disturbing rape scene.  The movie is well laid out and at the end you almost have contradictory feelings because you see the couple when everything is ok, but at the same time you know what is going to happen later that night.  The reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is because of the camera work at the very beginning of the movie.  I think that the varying angles were used to help illustrate the insanity of the situation, but to me it seemed a little over done.  I also was confused by the very end of the movie and have heard people say that it could be a dream, but I am not sure I saw it that way.<br />Either way very moving, very disturbing movie.<br />If you do decide to watch it, be warned that there is extreme violence and some not so main stream sexual acts.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The CD for the passion of the Christ is simply beautiful. It is haunting and enchanting, you can really get lost in the excellent music. If you have seen the movie, the music takes your mind to the images of our Lord as portrayed in Gibson's film. The CD is wonderful to pray or meditate too. It is a great soundtrack for a great movie.
B000002LR6|4.0|This is quite possibly the essential Ministry record. Mainly because Jesus Built My Hotrod is on it. But this is grinding, powerful and mechanic. If any record dispels their synth pop past it's this record ( should I have said that ).
0385510438|4.0|We've sometimes complained one doesn't know what to expect from Grisham:  long-winded drama (&quot;Chamber&quot;); gripping suspense (&quot;Pelican Brief&quot;); humor and whimsy (&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;); or just plain yarn-spinning (&quot;Painted House&quot;).  To us, he nearly perfectly combines all these elements in &quot;Last Juror&quot;.  Really two-thirds of the book is a charming and often funny account of how recent college graduate Willie Traynor buys the Mississippi small-town weekly, the &quot;Clanton Times&quot; (setting for &quot;Time to Kill&quot;), ingratiates himself with the residents, including those on both sides of the tracks (white and black), and both creates a winning business and brings new life to the otherwise fairly sleepy little burg.  When a sensational rape-murder occurs, ostensibly by a member of a reclusive family that owns their own nearby island, on which they pursue any number of illegal businesses, Traynor gets into the fray with headlines and editorials.  When the Padgitt kid is convicted, but eight years or so later gets paroled, and jurors start to die (as threatened by the convict at the trial), the intensity of current affairs reaches new heights as the remaining jurors, one a steadfast personal friend of Traynor, fear for their lives.  The ultimate outcome was a huge surprise.  And the death of Traynor's black friend at the end is nothing short of evocative and emotional -- and more than one crocodile tear ran down our face at the conclusion.<br />So while we are never quite sure what to expect from our prolific popular novelist, and while we often find fault with his boring dialogue or weakening plots, we shall be among the lavish praise-givers for this fine book.  It touches almost all our senses and feelings, and leaves us highly satisfied and entertained.  Enjoy!
B000099T2L|5.0|i have known since day one that beyonce would be succesful. every track is seemilinglessly awesome and could be released as a single, especially track 05 {be with you). besides that beyonce deserved all of her grammys and all of you that dont like beyonce because she &quot;changed&quot; just do not have anything else better to do with your time. giving this cd a one is appauling and just down right insipid of anyone to do without something concrete to back it up besides &quot;she's to nasty&quot; or &quot;she should have stayed w/ destiny's child&quot;. look at the musical content, not just at beyonce!
B00008J4P5|4.0|The White Stripes have been regarded as being at or near the top of the new garage wave, commercially and artistically. That's up to debate... but either way, Elephant is a fantastic reminder of classic brit-pop, and a record that belongs in the collections of both casual and hardcore pop-rock fans.<br />&quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, as simple as the introduction is to play, brought a bit of variety to rock radio (though it was played so much that it almost took away the variety it brought and replaced it with itself). And as far as Led Zeppelin esque guitarwork goes, &quot;Black Math&quot; and &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; (which is one of the longer tracks on the disc) work wonders. For those who crave a 50s/60s flavor, the Stripes seem to stay in the U.S. and travel to Nashville for the Presley-like &quot;I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself&quot;. Drummer Meg White, one of only two band members, lends her beautiful and pleasant vocals to &quot;In The Cold, Cold Night&quot;.<br />Any other great tracks? Sure... but that's up to your tastes. Just be ready for the cutesy, tongue-in-cheek closer &quot;It's True That We Love One Another&quot;. Elephant was heavily (note: pun) intended for the light-hearted.
B0000CFW87|2.0|Very simply - no matter how beautiful a voice he has, I want to hear songs that I understand.  Why can't he do a CD totally in English?
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Greatest hits collections usually aren't worth the money to the passionate fan. Often containing a radio staple or two and some other chart smashes, they're said to be best left for those who don't have deep interests in the particular band. The Beatles' 1 is a much different case however, as it has a total of 27 #1 hits on a single LP, and they come from several different eras of Beatles history.<br />The first half or so contains the fab four's early chart toppers, such as &quot;Love me do&quot;, &quot;I want to hold your hand&quot;, &quot;Can't buy me love&quot;, and &quot;A hard day's night&quot; (as well as many others). Straight forward, simple (in construction) pop rock... the way it should be done. Approximately 2-3 minutes long and filled with catchy choruses... and with each Beatle succeeding at utilizing their particular instruments. Like all of the band's work, what makes these tracks work is the passion of them... and the realization that every member of the band is always at the top of their game.<br />The second half... well, we get more complicated. After starting off with Ringo Starr's silly classic &quot;Yellow submarine&quot;, this part of the record displays The Beatles' maturation as both song writers and people. &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, somewhat like &quot;Yesterday&quot;, is a bit more on the mellow and depressing side... but the contemplation it causes is something many of us can relate to. The three Magical Mystery Tour tracks, &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;All you need is love&quot;, and &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, respectively fill the listener with nostalgia, desire for love (obviously!), and acknowledgement of how confusing relationships can be. As for the last eight tracks... they're a worthwhile sample of what The Beatles developed into. For pure, soft, and powerful emotion, there's &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Let it be&quot;, and the closer &quot;The long and winding road&quot;. For the fan of the straight-forward, slow-but-deep rock tune, there's &quot;Come together&quot;. And for the inbetween, there's &quot;Get back&quot;, &quot;The ballad of John and Yoko&quot;, and &quot;Something&quot;.<br />The point of all these words? 1 is full of powerful emotions, from sadness to happiness to pure love. Ultimately, it is a human record, and consists of 27 tracks millions and millions of people have taken to both heart and mind. Obviously, it's not a collection of all the great Beatles songs... but all of them can't be fit onto one, two, or even three records.
B000035P80|5.0|If that's who wrote the songs, then that's who's supposed to 'star' in the movie. {Roger Ebert had to check his archives to see if he orginally  noticed what a jerk Dylan was,(he was happy to find that his current opinion hadn't been contradicted in his 60's review).} The funny thing is, the journalists who <BR>Bob is so rude to were giving him good writeups.(ps,for whatever reason, Amazon 's been post-scripting this review as being for the vhs version, is it, in fact, for the dvd.)
0440237688|5.0|Lowry does a good job of writing a fast-paced dystopia novel where society, making a sort of deal with the devil, trades in their humanity--their choices, their capacity to error, their inclination for diversity and adventure--for a safe cozy womb-like existence where a false perfection kills the human spirit. Jonas, the main character, is a twelve-year-old boy who, like Jim Carey in the Truman Show, must re-evaluate what freedom is and act on his courage to change his destiny. A society that seeks to remain ignorant in the name of a utopia is a great theme that is explored effectively in this novel. For some companion pieces, I recommend H.G. Wells' short story In the Country of the Blind and two films: the aforementioned Truman Show and Pleasantville.
B000002KMY|5.0|At least listen to \\"Danger Zone\\" and \\"Time Machine\\" first. I started Bass Guitar because of songs like that by Black Sabbath. Pick up from leaving off with \\"Time Machine\\" and now jam into \\"Turn Up The Night\\". I am once again, falling in love with Geezer Butler's Bass Guitar. I think you'll enjoy it too!<br />   I liked H&H, and thought it was ok. But this is like the bonus disc. I think Mob Rules would have made H&H better if they were a set. I seriously think that H&H and Mob Rules should be two cds as a set pack. That way you won't have a hard time looking for the best of the band. <BR> <BR>     This is what the band has hidden behind Ozzy. Although I never really liked Ozzy. If only they could redo the Black Sabbath Classics with Ronnie James Dio....

B00005JMCN|5.0|It is rare that a horse movie is exciting, touching, AND believable. Moreover, it is rare that a movie based on a true story fully captures that story. But \\"Seabiscuit\\" accomplishes it all. As a horseback rider and racing fan myself, I tend to be extremely critical of horse movies, but this one takes all five stars and change. I've yet to see a better horse movie. Set in Depression-era America, \\"Seabiscuit\\" is the true story (adapted from the best-selling biography by Laura Hillenbrand) of an underdog racehorse by the same name. Misunderstood and mistreated as a colt, the plain, unimpressive little horse with imperfect conformation has a career that's going nowhere.<br /><br />Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) is a shattered man. His wife leaves him after their son dies in an automobile accident, and he closes down his car racing outfit and heads to the border towns of Mexico looking for escape. Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), a cowboy who finds the Wild West vanishing under his feet, is left as a drifter without much of a future. Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire) was left as a boy by his family, who hoped he might do better for himself as a racehorse jockey. He earns a little extra money as a fighter, but a severe blow to the eye leaves him half-blind. Ultimately, these three downtrodden men manage to find each other, and Seabiscuit, and embark on the journey of a lifetime.<br /><br />With Howard as owner, Smith as trainer, and Pollard as jockey, Seabiscuit manages to win race after race on the West coast. It seems they have it made. But then Smith points out that Seabiscuit has yet to race against War Admiral (son of the great Man O'War), the Triple Crown winner who many believe to be the greatest racehorse in America. Howard takes it upon himself to arrange a match race between the two horses, but War Admiral's owner is uncooperative, viewing Seabiscuit as an over-hyped nag that isn't worth the time. Seabiscuit's team eventually wins out and a match is arranged. Shortly before the race, however, Pollard breaks a leg in a freak accident, leaving him out of commission, perhaps permanently. Legendary jockey George Woolf (Gary Stevens) is called in to ride Seabiscuit in the match (I won't reveal the outcome, though perhaps you can guess). In a later race, Seabiscuit injures a tendon, and it looks as if he'll never race again. At this point Seabiscuit and Pollard, both battered and broken, find kinship in each other. Over time, they both begin to mend. Could the two possibly end up making the comeback of a lifetime?<br /><br />I'll warn those of you who have read Hillenbrand's book that the movie does not strictly adhere to it. It would be impossible to fit all of a 400+ page book into a 2-hour movie, so much is left out. But the movie is still satisfying in its own right. In fact, you might say it has a happier ending, as the movie cuts out at the height of Seabiscuit's career, whereas the book continues on to the deaths of all its main characters. But the movie still manages to capture the basic essence of the book. I loved the fact that the story is interspersed with slideshows of real photographs, where a narrator provides historical background information. It makes the movie feel slightly more like a documentary, but not overly much so. The cinematography itself it beautiful, as is every location at which parts of the movie were filmed.<br /><br />Every single actor turned in a superb performance. I was apprehensive about seeing \\"Spider Man\\" as a racehorse jockey, but Tobey Maguire quickly banished all my doubts. Not only does he come across as a convincing horseman, but he gives his character a wonderful depth of emotion and sensitivity. Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper are equally impressive in their roles. Perhaps the most pleasant surprise for me was seeing Gary Stevens, a man I've long admired as a real racehorse jockey (he rode such great horses as Thunder Gulch, Point Given, Winning Colors, Serena's Song, and Silver Charm), put out a very convincing performance as George Woolf. He was quite impressive, considering that \\"Seabiscuit\\" is his first and only movie. William H. Macy adds humor to the story as \\"Tick-Tock\\" McGlaughlin, an eccentric radio host and the only non-historical character in the film.<br /><br />Though I think any horse person will find \\"Seabiscuit\\" to be a wonderful film, I recognize the fact that it may not hold appeal for all audiences. Someone with no interest in horses may very well find the movie boring, as horses are undeniably the focal point here. But by the same token, my father isn't a horse person at all, and he loved the film. So if horses really aren't your thing, use your own best judgement in deciding whether or not to see the movie. But if you are a horse person, I would recommend this film most highly. Unlike many horse movies, it is accurate and believable (much thanks to real-life jockey Chris McCarron, who helped ensure the realism of the race scenes). It is also very touching, even tear-jerking at times, yet doesn't venture into the superfluous.<br /><br />The DVD has several great bonus features. \\"Seabiscuit: Racing Through History\\" provides additional information on Seabiscuit's career, including interviews with director Gary Ross and writer Laura Hillenbrand. \\"Bringing the Legend to Life: The Making of Seabiscuit\\" is a good making-of featurette, revealing much of the work that went into this production. \\"Anatomy of a Movie Moment\\" shares more of the film-making process. \\"Photo Finish: Jeff Bridges' On the Set Photographs\\" is a nice gallery of pictures taken during production. Finally, there is commentary by Gary Ross and filmmaker Steven Soderbergh. If you love horses, this DVD is more than worth the money. It will remain a cherished part of my collection for years to come.eorge Woolf. He was quite impressive, considering that \\"Seabiscuit\\" is his first and only movie. William H.

B00006CXSS|4.0|While I appreciate the bad reviews of this mini-series (I always look at those first to gain a real objective view of material befire I purchase it) I cannot help but be a little upset by the reviewers that say that this is yet another &quot;Americans beating the badguys&quot; &quot;Rambo-esque&quot; &quot;War glorifying&quot; etc. picture churned out by the Spielberg-Hanks propaganda machine.  Some of you who have watched this series and commented on it's inaccuracies and Ambrose's failure to make solid his book by using more sources just don't get it.<BR>This movie is not about glofiying war, it is not about America beating the bad-guy, it is not about being a WW2 documentary.  It is about a group of men relating their stories.  What they remember about a great hardship in their lives.  I think that Ambrose does these men a little justice and mercy by letting the storytellers tell their experiences and not tearing them down for the sake of accuracy.  Let the men tell it how they remember it.  It gives us in a younger generation some insight to how it was for these men, not neccessarily whether they were on this side of germany or not.  It is not a portal into the past for the sake of preserving history, it is a portal into the past through the eyes of those who lived it for the sake of preserving their memories.<BR>I did not really get the idea that this film was about glamorizing the American war machine.  Those who watched this movie and saw G.I.Joe, Rambo, Discrimination against Germans must already have a deep seeded hatred for American and it's foreign policies.  Germans running away or surrenduring to the Americans was common.  Those who have actually read through the history of the Europan Invasion know that the German army was under a great deal of stress.  Allied bombings kept supplies at the rear and most surrenduring Germans were just looking for an end to fatigue, suffering, etc.  Furthermore, the men portrayed in this film state how much respect theyhad for the German army as a worthy opponent.  What I saw most in this film was the loss, hardship, friendship, and horror that these men survived.  If you watch the interviews and documentary in part 11, you see that these men were forever changed by what they did and experienced.  They lost friends, they lost family, they lost their innocence.  I enjoyed this series not for the action or the violence, but for the stories from those who were there.  What they saw, and what it meant to them is what drives this movie.<br />And to those in Europe who are giving this movie a bad review for propping up the American &quot;Sport&quot; of war, I say unto you: You are welcome.  <br />Enjoy your Fuhrer-free freedom brought to you by the American armed forces.
078401115X|5.0|I would rate this movie as one of the best supernatural thrillers ever. Alan Parker conjures up an atmosphere you can feel. The wetness and humidity of New Orleans, the dark hallways, the sound of a heartbeat. Robert DeNiro's eyes in the last scene are forever planted in my head.
B00005MAM2|5.0|First off let me clear something up. THE NEW DUB IS MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!! EVERYONE THAT KEEPS DOWN-TALKING IT HAVE CLEARLY NEVER SEEN THE JAPANES VERSION!! If you're going to redub an anime you're not going to hire voice that sound just like the original, you want voices that fit the characters and sound like the Japanese voices. <br />Glad I got that out.<br />Now as for the DVD we all know this one's a classic. Every anime fan should own this movie. It's packed FULL of extras and it looks and sounds better than it ever has. Plus the new dub sounds great. Pioneer went through great lenghths to keep this dub as close to the original Japanes version as possible and they have succeeded. Get this movie!!
B0001ADAVK|4.0|<BR>Okay, this is obviously a chick flick.  So, if you want to rent the Fast and the Furious, or watch Wrestlemania this ain't yer cup-o-tea!<br />However, if you're the average guy who can sit through a typical drama you'll get through this one fine, and might even like it.  It's essentially Dead Poets Society, but with women characters. And despite the way it's billed it's not that serious or dramatic or feminist.<br />Julia Roberts, Julia Stiles and Kirsten Dunst all give good performances.  The plot is somewhat predictable, the message obvious.<br />In short, my expectations were low and I was pleasantly surprised.  So if your girlfriend or wife insists on renting this, don't despair. There are worse ways to spend an evening (and then next week they'll have to sit through X-Men 2 with you!).<BR>
B00018D44U|3.0|After Come Away With Me, I have to confess that Feels Like Home is a little disapointing.  I love the song Sunrise but after that first song, it gets a little repetitive as you go along and it is hard to keep your interest after a while.  This, on the other hand, does make it a good CD to play in the background while doing work or something.  It won't distract you and you can stay focused.  I feel that the CD is a good investment if you are someone who is patient enough to grow to like a CD, instead of tossing it on the shelf after one play.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I just saw 'He's Starsky and I'm Hutch' a doc on the life of David Soul. I didn't realise the these guys get nothing for any of this. Not a red cent. I'm now not so happy about this. Even the film uses 'Silver Lady' that;s a David Soul song not a Hutch song.<br />I'd like to start a campaign.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|When I was a teenager I remember sitting with my father late into the night and watching Yazujiro Ozu's &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;. It's a film about two old parents who visit their children in Tokyo and find their kids are too busy for them. <br />It's a very slow moving film. To the uninitiated, nothing seems to happen. But everything happens. It contains a world of hopes and dreams.<br />I would not go so far as to say Sofia Coppola is an Ozu, but she exhibits that same quality of being able to look at the stillnesses of modern life. As with &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; and many other Ozu films, some will feel nothing happens. <br />One doesn't expect brash Westerners to understand this feeling of stillness, but Sofia Coppola shows how it is part of them too. Like &quot;Tokyo Story&quot; this is about people who visit a city that they do not fit into. Unlike the earlier film, here they find one another, and offer a little support. It's a touching and poignant film. <br />I'd also like to add a comment on the DVD. I didn't much like the previews, even if you could fast forward through them. I do wish there had been a director's commentary (or an actors' commentary). For once the &quot;making of&quot; is a genuine production diary and not just a promotional device. I loved it, particularly Bill Murray's Japanese lessons &quot;Who do you think you're talking to!&quot;. I also enjoyed the offtakes. I do wish the interview with Murray and Coppola had been filmed with them sitting down. It would have been more comfortable. But it's good to see the evident affection they have for one another. <br />For now, Sofia Coppola is a breath of fresh air in the film industry. I hope she can keep it up. I want to see more films like this, although not - I should add - just a reworking of this.

0784011176|5.0|THE PIANO is a very unusual, enigmatic and haunting film. To say anything less would be incredulous. It is a story set in some remote coastal hills of a very bleak eighteenth century New Zealand overrun by dense jungle, mud, the elements and crude natives. Ada (Holly Hunter) and her young mischievously meddlesome daughter Flora (Anna Paquin) arrive on the New Zealand beach to meet Stewart (Sam Neill) whom has arranged to marry Ada. Ada, as we discover in the prolog is a woman who has not spoken since she was 6 years old. She is not only mute but strangely introverted and repressed. A piano, which Ada has brought with her, is her only means of expression. The ex-seaman ex-whaler Baines (Harvey Keitel) is a rather crude looking character who becomes enchanted by Ada's piano, which has been left on the beach. He retrieves it, buys it and then has Ada barter for its return setting the conflict of personalities and their repressed feelings into motion. Ada's mute playing of the piano is juxtaposed by her piercing dark eyes focusing from her face shrouded in ever so pale white skin. Her looks are riveting and disturbing. The image of Paquin's face is unnerving. As the film progresses we see that the primary characters are truly misunderstood from what our initial impressions had ascertained them to be. This is an exceptional film that you have to watch and listen to closely because of its very subtle nature that envelops your senses. The characters and the actors that portray them are brilliantly presented. Stuart Dryburgh's cinematography is equally important because the images on the screen take on a life and spirit of their own in this haunting film.
B00000DFSK|1.0|The best songs are edited, presumably so that you'll go out and by the original CD's.  They sound like something the publishers would put on Kazaa to discourage pirating.  Ridiculous!<br />It's really not fair to put out edited versions without saying so on the cover.
0062502182|1.0|It probably isn't worth criticizing a book like this.  If you happen to be a fan of the genre -- simpleminded inspirational fables -- you'll probably like this book.  If you're not a fan of this genre, stay as far away as possible.<br /><br />The book is basically a string of fortune cookies presented in the form of a story about a Spanish sheperd boy who listens to his heart and seeks a treasure buried (inexplicably) near the Egyptian pyramids.  And when I say the boy listens to his heart, he really listens to his heart: by the end of the book, he is having full debates with his heart, not to mention with the desert, the wind, the sun, the Magical Hand, and the Soul of the World, all of whom speak in conveniently short sentences.<br /><br />The lessons contained in this book do not constitute \\"simple wisdom\\" or \\"spiritual messages.\\"  They are feel-good cliches, pure and simple.  Some of the cliches may be true, but they're unlikely to change anyone's life.  As one of the positive reviewers of this book notes, \\"THE POINT, is that what you search for is usually RIGHT THERE all along, and that the journey you take to find it is about learning lessons and growing as a person. Get it yet? LIFE IS IN THE JOURNEY, NOT THE DESTINATION!!\\"  There you go.  You don't have to read the book now.  You've just saved yourself ten bucks.<br /><br />Although you won't learn anything from this book, perhaps you'll get some spiritual uplift from the story itself.  I personally found the story pointless and the writing limp, but you be the judge:<br /><br />\\"Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.\\"<br />\\"One is loved because one is loved.  No reason is needed for loving.\\"<br /><br />There are about ten quotes like this per page, so if this sort of thing cheers you, you might find the book to your liking.  Alternatively, you could rent the Wizard of Oz, which is far more enjoyable and conveys the same messages.<br /><br />Basically this book spends a lotof time trying to convince you of the joys of journeying and learning about life.  If you don't need any convincing, I recommend buying some real literature or going on an actual journey.  You might actually learn something.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Music fans who consider 1978's \\"Some Girls\\" one of the greatest LPs the Rolling Stones ever released need only partake of \\"Let It Bleed\\" to see the light - and the error of their ways.  Completed shortly after original guitarist (and founder) Brian Jones's death, this effort could have been ragged and uneven, given the fact that Mick Taylor had not yet been fully integrated.  But those are hollow and illusory fears.  Jones had been disintegrating into drug addiction, virulent misogyny, acute neurosis and misguided megalomania long before the sessions for \\"Let It Bleed\\" commenced.  The brilliantly talented Taylor added beauty and creativity to the Stones (give a listen to 1971's \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and 1974's \\"Rock and Roll\\" for ample proof of his genius), but \\"Bleed\\" showcases Keith Richards's stamp of approval as no Stones LP has - before or since.<br />Track #1, Gimme Shelter, heralds the Stones in all their fearsome, terrifying glory.  The song is also memorable for the presence of Merry Clayton, who has the singular distinction of stealing the show from Mick Jagger - in the midst of one of his  finest performances.  No female singer who's ventured onstage with the Stones has ever accomplished what Clayton does here - she is simply stunning.  When Jagger graciously steps aside and lets the songstress belt out her solo, the effect is spellbinding.  (Sadly, Clayton did not parlay this triumph into subsequent success, and that's a tragedy, to be sure.)  Moreover, no mention of this song is complete without credence given to Richards - his guts and grit are all over \\"Gimme Shelter.\\"  It is, in my opinion, arguably the Stones' finest hour.<br />Track #4, Live With Me, allows Bill Wyman's propulsive bass to take center stage - it's a raunchy, randy slice of hormonal hazing that's downright nirvanic:  it ain't poetry, nor is it a tender love ballad (\\"Don't-cha thank there's a puh-layse for yew...in between the sheets....\\") - but if you want treacle, listen to Kathy Lee Gifford sing \\"Only My Pillow Knows.\\"  I don't look to the Stones for evocations of romance - or for theological answers.  I listen to the Stones to partake of their singular sound - and to be transported far, far away from this cold, cruel world.  And Bobby Keyes' introduction to The Joy of Sax cannot be dismissed - he's aces.  <br />Track #6 - Midnight Rambler - Jagger's menacing stage persona (who later morphed into the English gentleman so ineffectual at Altamont) achieves perfect expression here.  Again, Richards' gifts are on abundant display as well.  Listening to this song brings to mind something I read in Rolling Stone's inaugural \\"Record Guide\\" (published in 1979):  \\"Listening to this LP, one could believe in, fear and tremble at every aspect of the Stones' myth.\\"  It's a powerhouse performance.<br />Track #8 - Monkey Man - The first 40 seconds of this song are a flight through Rock's Elyssian Fields:  Richards grabs the listener by the senses and holds on - with a vise grip.  The song also boasts Nicky Hopkins' lilting and irridescent piano - it makes for an unforgettable experience.  When I first heard this song in January 1972 as a 13-year-old, the effect was staggering.  I forgot who I was, where I was, and where I was going.  I've listened to it hundreds of times since, and the song never gets old - never.<br />The LP closes with \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\"  Like \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" this is, quite simply, one of the band's finest recorded offerings.  Like Merry Clayton's vocal vibrance  on \\"Shelter,\\" Al Kooper's piano shines all over this song like an aurora borealis - it is a gorgeous performance.  <br />\\"Let It Bleed\\" must take its place at the top of Stones' pantheon - along with \\"Aftermath\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\", and \\"Exile on Main Street.\\"  I must agree with Rolling Stones' 1979 \\"Record Guide\\" in that \\"the old energy of the Stones is gone for good.....records like \\"Some Girls\\" are hollow echos of the band's best moments.\\"  <br />Yes, the RollingStones have earned the title of the \\"World's Greatest Rock 'n Roll Band\\" - by their longevity, their distinctiveness, their ability to rise above petty squabbling, drug addiction and narcissistic excess - and not least by offerings like \\"Let It Bleed.\\"  A searing counterpart to the sappy \\"Let It Be\\", the Beatles' swan song so mutilated by Phil Spector, the record was a fitting tribute to the end of the 1960s:  a testament to the joyous music that enthralled the discerning rock fan....and a reminder, weeks before Altamont, that unchecked adulation carries a price - a price that can carry with it the seed of tragedy.

0066620996|2.0|The number 1 fallacy is if a dog is brown, a cat is brown, therefore a cat is a dog. Similar to the same train of thought, Good to Great presents the same formula-based approach of dissecting historical data of successful companies, without understanding just how companies not only operate at the macro level, much of their successes or failures can result at the micro level too. Rather superficial and flawed arguments. Try more balanced approaches without hyperbole, like The Art of Happiness at Work or the new book Dot Zen.

0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki presents nothing new that our grandparents knew about - honest living, not making wild claims or dreams, and live reasonably. Many of his works are repetitive and dreary, with no real breakthroughs, and advocating the haphazard things like MLM, which aren't exactly cutting-edge or sure thing. Stay away from hyperbole like this, and perhaps, if you read the likes of &quot;The Art of Happiness at work&quot;, or even &quot;Dot Zen&quot; by a bunch of new Asian authors, you might learn something new. Oh yes, Tuesdays with Morrie works for me too.
0767803434|5.0|Don't try to figure out just how many rounds of machine gun fire an aircraft can absorb without depressurizing and crashing. Just sit back and enjoy the story, for heaven's sake. We viewers are now always required to BELIEVE the stuff we're watching; most movies are made to entertain; few are made to educate. If you take Air Force One for what it is, a wholly impossible and improbably bit of acting and producing and directing, then you won't be disappointed. It's not trying to be Shakespeare, so don't try to judge it as such.<BR>Harrison Ford plays a U.S. president who seems to have gotten his training in guerrilla warfare or at least as a member of the Green Berets. He single-handedly bests a band of Russian thugs who try to pull of a mid-flight takeover of Air Force One. Glenn Close is the VP who manages things from Washington. Stuff happens so fast in this action-thriller that you won't have time to wonder why the plane didn't crash within the first 20 minutes.<BR>Top notch stuff, for what it's meant to be.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just watched the entire 'Firefly' series in three consecutive sittings, and I'm compelled to try to convince any fence-sitters to give this series an honest chance. This is definitely worth owning on DVD.<P>To my shame, I saw bits of this series during its disgracefully short television run and really didn't care for it at the time. Most of the blame of course goes to the network, which stuck Firefly into an inconvenient time slot and aired the 2-hour pilot episode that establishes the premise & players as the series FINALE -- unforgivable with a show whose appeal so deeply springs from its evolving characters. Not having a feel for the people and their situations, tuning into the series left me thinking that the whole premise of the show simply revolved around the 'Wild West in Space' concept, which didn't strike me at the time as particularly clever or interesting. Add to that the Chinese slang used for cursing which must have sounded good on paper but actually detracts in practice (Galactica's 'frak!' and 'felgercarb!' sounded much more natural), and the apparent central plot of an extremely evil bunch of gloved government agents and the reason they seem to want River Tam... well, that idea was a yawner 25 years ago when it was the basis for 'The Fury,' and about a hundred science-fiction stories like it before and since. So when Firefly was cancelled, I was only mildly disappointed.<P>But now, seeing the series straight through, complete and sequential, I can appreciate it for the first time, and deeply; I wish I had understood its wonderful qualities right from the start. The characters and their relationships are exceptionally rendered; the casting is perfect; the production values are top notch; the dialog with its well-timed humor is a real joy... now I'm left wanting much more! I guess I'll have to watch the series straight through again right away; I'm sure I'll pick up much more detail during a second pass.<P>The real fun of Firefly is watching a groupof well-developed characters with very different points of view try to make it to the next day in a morally ambiguous universe with a quirky social order. Oh, and there are spaceships, knives, guns, grenades, train robberies, shoot-outs, prostitutes, kidnappers, cattle-rustlers, break-ins, bounty hunters, gangsters, and tough guys that wear colorful wool knit hats, too. (And sing!) And while it is certainly science-fiction, the technology does not get in the way at all (no ditching out of tight spots by 'reversing the phase polarity of the tetrion field'), and the drama springs from the characters and not any gee-whiz alien-of-the-week (there are no aliens, only human settlers). Solid, interesting drama with no dodgy literary tricks.<P>The DVD set is nicely presented with the four discs each in their own ThinPak slim cases - no annoying accordion/billfold packaging - and these are held together by an outer box sleeve. The menus on the discs are just a little annoying and don't reflect the mood of the show, and the disclaimer about the `opinions expressed' seems to hang on the screen forever, but these are very minor gripes. <P>Like the series, the extras in this set are far too short-lived for my tastes, but are worth every minute. Several of the episodes have commentaries which range from heartwarming fun to very enlightening. One easily comes to empathize with the love these people had for their show. The commentary on `Objects in Space' is a solo by Whedon, and rather than reveal anecdotes about the production, he gives us a lengthy insight into what he was trying to achieve with this episode (which ended up being the last). Some have criticized this commentary as being ambiguous and self-indulgent, but I hung on every word as the filmmaker explained the key concepts he tried to communicate and the methods he used to do so. Really good stuff. If you enjoy Firefly, and if you listen to one DVD commentary this year, make it a commentary from this set.<P>Some may beturned off by the fact that they would be jumping into a show that is already orphaned, so 'why get into it?' Well, partially bolstered by the success of the sales of these discs, a theatrical film is currently in the works, and this DVD set would be a perfect lead up to it. And to borrow from one of the characters in the series, 'just because I may lose something doesn't mean I'm not going to try to have it.'<P>Give Firefly a chance. Every episode is a gem, and just because you'll be left wondering what happens next doesn't mean you shouldn't find out what's happened so far.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|A noirish guilty pleasure. Gunslinging vampire-enforcer Kate Beckinsale looks good in black leather (as does the film), even with the world's worst haircut. The story has something to do with an ancient feud between vampires and werewolves, in which a human gets ensnared and Kate falls in love with him. I have no idea whether the film is meant to be taken seriously or not (in one scene our intrepid and entrapped Kate keeps firing bullets in a circle until the floor gives way beneath her--the Marx Brothers once did the same thing with a handsaw), but I broke out in laughter from time to time.
0385504209|1.0|For a book which purports to spout realistic theories about the Holy Grail, this singularly lacks research. I cannot in all honesty say anything about the fundamental hypothesis, but living in Paris I can certainly say something about the setting. It is obvious that the author has not made some very basic efforts.<br />  For instance, you cannot hope to go to Lille from Gare Saint Lazare; you would have to leave from Gare du Nord. In the same vein, I would much like to know how the heroes manage to find several taxies waiting in Saint Lazare at roughly three in the morning. There are no trains at this late hour, so there would be no taxis. And it goes on and on. To go from Tuileries to the American Embassy, you would not not need to go up rue des Champs Elysees, since the embassy is exactly at the beginning of that street.<br />  You would think that the author would at least have bothered to pick up a map when writing the book. If that is all the extent of his research on Paris, I refuse to believe he has done serious work on the other aspects of the book.<br />  This novel is a joke.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's first album captured my ears, I've seen her in concert three times, and have an autographed poster of her up in my room for the past years. I bought \\"Life For Rent\\" the day it was released. The album is just as excellent as the first if not better. Her lyrics are captive with many a person can related to, and her words are passionate as well. Her beautiful voice is amazing and one of a kind. <br />1- White Flag -  (4.5/5) 1st single off the record, great song to start off the album. This song is excellent \\"...I won't put my hands up and surrender. There will be no white flag above my door, I'm in love and always will be...\\" I saw on TV this song's acoustic performance on the Europe Music Awards, it was astounding that the entire audience sang along with her.<BR> <BR>2- Stoned - (3.5/5) Didn't know what to expect from the title of this song, the music is different, it lasts for at least a minute until Dido begins to sing. <br />3- Life For Rent -  (5/5) It's a great song no wonder it's the title track of the album. \\"While my heart is shield and I won't let it down, while I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try, well how can I say I'm alive.\\" <br />4- Mary's In India - (3/5) It's a different song. Features only her voice and an acoustic guitar. This song shows off her beautiful voice. <br />5- See You When You're 40 - (4/5) It's a beautiful song. I liked it right away. I think it's a song about finding out another person's true colors, seeing what that person is all about and realize that they are not worth it. \\"Well if you had walked past me today I wouldn't have picked you out, now I've seen tonight, how could I waste my time and I'll be on my way and I won't be back...\\"<br />6- Don't Leave Hone - (4/5) Another wonderful track written by the Armstrong siblings. I think it's a great song about being there for someone. Catching lyrics, \\"and if you're cold I'll keep you warm if you're low just hold on, cos I will be your safety...\\"<br />7- Who Makes You Feel- (3/5) The music is okay but not as good compared to the rest. But the lyrics are great though. \\"Who makes you feel the way that I make you feel, who loves you and knows you the way I do...\\"<br />8- Sand In My Shoes - (4/5) I really like this song, it's a bit poppy and uplifting. \\"I've still got sand in my shoes and I can't shake the thought of you. I should get on forget you but why would I want to. I know we said goodbye...but I want to see you again.\\"<br />9- Do You Have A Little Time - (3.5/5) This song is defiantly different, it's darker compared to the rest. But overall a good song, take awhile to get used to.<br />10- This Land Is Mine - (6/5) This is one amazing and beautiful song, the best track on the CD. It should be a single. I just love the beginning of this song, captivating. As the song goes on, you'd want to sing along and listen to over and over. \\"From behind these walls I hear your song oh sweet words the music that you play lights up my world. The sweetest that I've heard...finally things are changing.\\"<br />11- See The Sun - (5/5) It's a great pick up song when you're feeling down. Music is beautiful and lyrics are splendid. Dido co-writes all of her song but this one is special because she wrote it by herself. \\"...and you're asking me why pain's the only way to happiness and I promise you you'll see the sun again...Do you remember telling me you'd found the sweetest thing of all. You said one day of this was worth dying for so be thankful you knew her at all...\\" <BR>There is a hidden track towards the end. It's a great short acoustic song, shows off her beautiful voice...if only the song was a bit longer. \\"I've been meaning to tell you,  the closer you get, the better I'll feel. Closer you are more I see why everyone says that I look happier when you're around.\\"<br />Life For Rent is an amazing album and I give it my HIGHEST recommendation. I cannot wait for her third album. Please do not download her songs off of any file swapping programs. This amazing, touching, captive album is WORTH buying and each song has a special meaning of it's own. Above description is what each song means to me. Why not buy the album, listen to each song and read along the lyrics as show in the insert and have special meanings of your own?  It's worth it.
0385720920|5.0|This book is nearly perfect in its ironic catastrophe. It is somehow a perfect circle of events and facts, all linking together to create an astonishing story that just might, for use of a boring and tired out cliche, take your breath away. The twists are thoroughly unexpected; perhaps this is due to the fact that the situation is completely unlike anything I've ever been involved in. Despite this, I can relate to the characters and sympathize with them. I read Fight Club and Survivor and have to say that I liked Choke the best, if only for its warped irony. Simply put, Choke rocks and so does Chuck.
B000067J1H|4.0|I had to buy this dvd after so many people said this was a warped and disturbing movie.It didn't scare me or make the hairs on my neck stand up but it's a pretty good film.It is a film you have to see more than once.God, do guys really feel like this.I'm 42, but I  was a snarlly punk when the first wave of punk happen.Hey,guys it's allright to show your sensitive side.I felt some sympathy for Jack, who doesn't hate phoney corporate america?But violence and beating someone into a bloody pulp  to feel alive?This film was branded facist by many mainstream film critics.A lot of these guys act like dimwitted bozos.I liked the charactors played by MEATLOAF,a lovable loser,and that brave little ho,HELENA BONHAM CARTER.Brad Pitt was good as usual,even though he's just a figment of Jack's personality.ED NORTON I wanna punch him out.Maybe that's the key to this movie's wild success with today's youth?He is nuts,but are't we all.?Anyway I liked this film,it's stylishly directed by DAVID FINCHER.It's got dark humor,a interesting script,and a wonderful score.There's several commentaries on the feature selection.If you wanna get real disturbed see,<BR>HENRY:PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER<BR>'HAPPINESS'<BR>'REQUIEM FOR A DREAM'<BR>'I STAND ALONE'<BR>'IRREVERSIBLE' <BR>and any TAKASHI MIIKE film,my faves being 'DEAD OR ALIVE'and'AUDTION'these films will blow your mind apart!
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|This film has several elements that are worth noting. First, it is an accurate account of the empty, amoral, flamboyant and insensitive life in the French &quot;high-life&quot; during the late 50's/early 60's. Told in flashback, the story shows the way the central characters behave, have fun, hurt people and get to a point when &quot;have fun&quot; is just a way of forgetting.<br />The whole cast is excelent. David Niven is the most perfect &quot;late life&quot; bachelor who is cool about everything. Jean Seberg is absolutely beautiful as a teenager who practically lives as a woman... the chemistry of the two characters (father and daughter) is fantastic (and very puzzling). Deborah Kerr has also a great role as a sophisticated woman who doesn't get to understand the games going on between father and daughter.<br />The film has a beautiful cinematography. It opens in a dark black and white while all the flashback scenes are in the most fantastic colors - a perfect example how cinematography serves to enhance the character's point of view and (also) tell the story at a visual level.<br />The final scene is something that will stay in your memory for a long time as a great example of a great conclusion for a story that is rich and well written.<br />This film is a serious study of aloofness, emptyness and amorality in a way that only Hollywood could tell. It shows that money can buy off some consciences while, deep inside, some consiences cannot be bought.<br />A trully great cinematic experience!!!<br />This DVD edition has no extras (except for trailers). The image quality is first rate. So is sound quality. The opening titles (by Saul Bass, no less!) is gorgeous! The cinemascope cinematography by Georges Perinal begs to be viewd in a big screen. The music score by the great Georges Auric (&quot;Rififi&quot; and &quot;La Bele et la Bête&quot;) is top.
B000000W5N|5.0|I have all of the stones albums up to EXILE on vinyl.I think the music is spotty.The Stones just never could make albums as good as THE BEATLES.STICKY FINGERS is my favorite of theirs.I listen to my vinyl copy with the famous Andy Warhol designed zipper jeans.This lp has the least filler tracks on any stones studio album.It came out in 1971 a banner year for classic rock albums.WHO'S NEXT,LED ZEPP IV,LAYLA,IMAGINE,and this one all came out this year.My favorite songs on STICKY FINGERS are,'BROWN SUGAR','WILD HORSES',DEAD FLOWERS'and the beautiful and poetic,'MOONLIGHT MILE'.The only ho-hum tune I skip is 'SWAY'.I only have 2 stones on cd.'THE LONDON YEARS' and 'JUMP BACK'.This is a great album.Get it,if you love the stones!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|Because it is loud, full of razzle-dazzle and (most of all) the characters are unattractive and unsympathetic. The story is weak, contrieved and full of umbelievable elements.<br />Having said that, I have to say this:<br />When I first heard about the movie, I thought &quot;Now that's a great idea... werewolves vs. vampires&quot;. But when the film actually began, I discovered I was wrong.<br />For me, the problem lies in the fact that this movie does not know what it is. Is it a horror film? Is it an action movie? Is it Sci-Fi? It tries to be &quot;The Matrix&quot; with it's there's-a-higher-plot-behind-this-plot approach. I don't think it works nearly half as well. The story seems quite simple in the beginning with the old narrated explanation formula that sets the story. Then the film goes on forever and new complications keep on coming (and they get to be more and more unbelievable). The screenwriter thought he was constructing a grandiose story... but instead of this he created a pompous story... that's all.<br />Then comes the image. Most of the time, it has this annoying effect of flashlighting which supposedly gives the film a &quot;thunder-like&quot; thing thoughout the entire film. This is not new and has been used many times before with great effect. The problem here is exactly that every effect is overdone...<br />Then comes the looks. The film has this I've-seen-this-cool-before look that obviously comes from (you guessed it) &quot;Blade&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Maybe they used the same wardrobe... duh! But the thing that annoys me most is (for instance) the fact that the mansion where the vampires live seems like a lobby of a big disco... (laughs) nice-looking people sitting there doing nothing.<br />Then comes the characters... there's simply no one there for you to like!!! They are always full of (too) serious faces expressing the oh-so-big crisis and hidden agendas behind it all. And the story starts to be so pompous that you don't care about what happens next.<br />Then comes the ludicrous aspects of the screenplay... werewolves and vampires are engaged in a battle that is centuries old (all this backstory is stupid)... they have lots of technology and weapons (James Bond-like gadgets) and keep on loudly blowing everything that comes in the middle... and yet they are a veeeery secret thing that we humans do not know about. They blow everything and no one ever asks what's going on... Hmmm... ok.... and the cars... They destroy a Jaguar just to have a Maseratti on the next scene....<br />It's all too cool to be believable. Keep your copies of &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Blade&quot; instead. At least these films have much better characters!<br />And it is 2 hours long!!!!<br />Go check &quot;AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON&quot;, &quot;THE HOWLING&quot;, &quot;FRIGHT NIGHT&quot; and &quot;NEAR DARK&quot; instead... just to name a few.ut what happens next.<br />Then comes the ludicrous aspects of the screenplay... werewolves and vampires are engaged in a battle that is centuries old (all this backstory is stupid)... they have lots of technology and weapons (James Bond-like gadgets) and keep on loudly blowing everything that comes in the middle... and yet they are a veeeery secret thing that we humans do not know about.

1563890119|5.0|This review is directed mainly at those of you who are not widely experienced with modern (one can hardly use the word `adult' without erotica coming to mind) comics, because I do not know many comics aficionados who are not familiar with the Sandman saga - the Citizen Kane of comics, or the Sgt. Pepper, or the War and Peace - and have not read, at the very least, this first installment in the series.<br />So - you haven't read comics in a long time, have you? Sure, you read it when you were a kid, like everyone else, but then you outgrew them. You went on to read real books with no pictures. But suddenly a couple of people tell you that there have been some interesting things going on in comics in the last twenty years, and you should check it out. You decide to give the ol' funnybooks a chance.<br />In that case, this book right here is one of the half-dozen masterworks you should start with to get a general idea of what comics are capable of, at least in the English speaking regions of the world (there are some fascinating things going on in Japan and France that I won't even begin to discuss). The Sandman, the ENTIRE Sandman saga, altogether ten books long - collected from magazine-form comics that were published regularly throughout most of the 90s - is one of the truly glorious, shining, perfect creations of, I'll say it, adult comics. That Preludes &amp; Nocturnes, the first story-arch in the series, is the only one that can stand rightly by its own right, other than being a convenience for new readers which may make it easier for them to deal with the size of this saga, is a sure sign of the wisdom of the creator, the brilliant Mr. Neil Gaiman. While completely revolutionizing what people though about comics, Neil started doing so in small doses to make it easier to swallow for audiences and editors alike. Thus, he started here with a story that is a classic folk tale, of a dethroned monarch who goes through a series of quests and challenges in order to earnback his rightful place in power. More help is given by cameo appearances of old and popular characters from the DC Comics universe - such as the Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, the Scarecrow and John Constantine. Such appearances will become quite rare as the series continues, and the story becomes, rather than a folk tale, a mythology as grim as any Greek tragedy - which, doubtlessly, was in the author's mind from the very beginning. However, though the storyline of Preludes &amp; Nocturnes is schematic and the drawings are often bland, Gaiman's already famous storytelling skills are fully developed, and the books is one of the most fantastic stories he had penned.<br />The hero of the series is, simply, Dream. His identity is a rather philosophical matter, as he is not so much a god of dream, but rather, the embodiment of the very concept of dream itself. At the beginning of the story, Dream is summoned by a human mystic, and caged. Seventy years later, when he escapes from his prison, he finds his kingdom in ruins, and must return to himself the symbolic garments of his reign to rebuild it. Along the way we have the pleasure to meet some of the most fantastic and fascinating characters in any literary creation, and also some characters who, small though their part may be now, will be crucial in the complete creation of the saga, such as Lucifer Morningstar, Cain and Abel, and the three Furies (also known as the Graces, the Fates, or the Kindly Ones). Though much more fascinating as part of the whole, Preludes &amp; Nocturnes by itself is a perfect piece of fantastic storytelling.<br />However, it is the final magazine issue in this collection, titled `The Sound Of Her Wings', that gives it more worth than the rest of it put together. Sam Keith's surreal, deformed image of Dream and dark, heavy, brooding lines move over to make place for Mike Dringenberg's realistic backgrounds, light-hearted lines and recognizable human faces. Dream's flowing black robes makeway for a t-shirt and a black jacket; the dark and towering Sandman is given a whole new perspective. He now seems like a depressed, bored teenager, sulking in the park and feeding the pigeons. He is then granted a visit by none other than his sister - Death, which is the single most brilliant creation in Gaiman's universe. Death is a perky, cheerful, beautiful, wise, mature goth-girl who confronts Dream and show to him his own pettiness. Completely without any action or suspense, it is this story that paved the way for the revolution that the Sandman series began. And this story alone remains one of the handful true perfect masterpieces of the medium. It is this story alone that makes this book a milestone in modern comics - and literature - and essential reading for everyone interested in the medium.<br />And, oh, I said half dozen masterworks, right? So, to complete the list, let's say: Alan Moore's `Watchmen', Art Spiegelman's `Maus', Scott McCloud's `Understanding Comics', Frank Miller's `The Dark Knight Returns' and Kurt Busiek's `Marvels'. Or, to make it a top ten, let's add Peter Kuper's `The System', Garth Ennis's `Preacher', Grant Morrison's `Arkham Asylum', and anything by Robert Crumb. Enjoy!
B00005R2M3|2.0|DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES is one of my all-time favorite albums; great songs you can sing and dance to, you don't need to speak spanish to enjoy, great guitar riffs and gritty vocals.<br /><br />Here, her first english album (which I waited a LONG time for) was one hell of a disappointment.<br /><br />Here she has taken on a totally new persona; she is no longer rock, she is pop. Instead of great rock you can dance to she is doing an Latin inpersontion of Brittney Spears (okay, she pulls it off quite well, but what about us? her fans who hate Brittney and the sex-kitten pop that has saturated the entire music scene and just like rock?) and left the guitars and the gritty lyrics behind.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I was hoping for more songs like \\"Ciega, Sordomuda\\" and \\"Inventible\\", songs of passion and longing, disappointment and rock; songs you can turn all the way up in your car and scream at the top of your lungs! Didn't happen this time, maybe next time.
B00005JN1L|3.0|...this movie wasn't very fantastic. As everyone said, if Johnny hadn't been in this movie, it would have been a straight-to-video type...but it might turn out that way anyway.

Otherwise, wait a few months and it'll be showing on HBO. :K<BR>Pros: Johnny...and Johnny.<BR>Cons: Predictable.<BR>Summary: Bad.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is truly one of the most inspired films to come out in the last ten years.  Mel Gibson has double-duty here as lead actor and director and acquits himself admirably at both.  His performance is so heart-felt that many times during the film I was impassioned to cry out with the collective shouting of his men.  He also uses nuance in the more intimate scenes between characters, using glances and gestures to propell the story.  His acting is just one of the many splendid performances in this epic; and all the other actors feed off Mel Gibson's passion.  His direction is also incredible for a first film, and it is remarkable how ambitious an undertaking this is.  All concerned with the making of this spledid film should be congratulated.  The costumes are extravagant and glow with authenticity, the art direction and set designs are all meticulously crafted, while the greatest star of this film is cinematographer John Toll.  His work here recieved the Oscar for Best Cinematography, which made him a back-to-back recipient of the award, having won the previous year for &quot;Legends of the Fall.&quot;  The photography here is stunning and captures all the beauty of the landscape, and the subtlety of character emotion equally well.  John Toll has continued to garner recognition for more recent work, including another Oscar nomination in 1998 for &quot;The Thin Red Line.&quot;  Another notable behind-the-scenes collaborator is screenwriter Randall Wallace.  His writing is excellent, with impressionable, quotable dialogue and incredibly memorable lines that I've heard many times over in the years since this film's theatrical release.  While I could nitpick and point out some obvious film editing flaws, those flaws are negligible when compared to the inspiration with which this film absolutely sparkles.  This film has everything: romance, tyranny, hope, betrayal, epic battles with intense realism, love, passion, wit, and loyalty.  This is an extraordinary film.  Not altogether perfect, but perfectly inspired.
B000006NPY|4.0|By far the Smashing Pumpkins most subdued album and probably their most extensive foray into electronic percussion which had a lot to do with the recent expulsion of their drummer. If you only want to rock out to heavy Pumpkin music a la SIAMESE DREAM, their enduring masterpiece, you'll be disappointed with ADORE.<br /><br />I'm all for bands exploring different directions with their music. However, this electro-tinged album's worth of softies really isn't their strongest set. And it's not cause they can't do mellow; Corgan and co. have already proved repeatedly they can make beautiful mellow songs on previous efforts. But they've never done a whole album like that so maybe it's a bit hard to take compared to the colossal theater of rock from previous albums. It's true that many a fan recoiled in dismay from ADORE, but that shouldn't detract from what is truly excellent on this record.<br /><br />Billy Corgan (the undisputed mastermind behind SP) believe it or not put some of his best written songs on this album. I've always thought Corgan's voice sounded best surrounded by big, loud, distorted guitars, but on ADORE he turns in some of his smoothest singing ever, maybe out of consideration for the comparatively bare surroundings that leave his voice more exposed.<br /><br />The breakdown:<br /><br />\\"To Sheila\\" - hushed and unhurried, this one is lovely and features some poetic words from Corgan (not always the best lyricist). It's a deceptively simple vocal and guitar with some nice background touches. *****<br /><br />\\"Ave Adore\\" - **** -electronic percussion with live drums. This one lays on radical romantic attitude that's deliciously over-the-top. The sound is similar to \\"Eye\\" whose inclusion on this album would've boosted it tremendously. \\"Eye\\" is sort of Victorian-meets-electronica, found on the LOST HIGHWAY soundtrack. Recorded around the same time, it's at least as good as anything on ADORE.<br /><br />\\"Perfect\\" - is OK but doesn't turn me on. Unfortunately, it kills the mood set up by \\"Ava Adore\\" and suffers as a result. I usually skip it. **<br /><br />\\"Daphne Descends\\" - is low-key and strangely compelling although it doesn't completely turn me on.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|It's ironic to see one reviewer criticising \\"Lost in Translation\\" for cultural insensitivity and then saying it presents such a cliched view of Japanese he expected Bruce Lee to show up. Is it too cruel to point out that Bruce Lee was not Japanese, but is actually a Chinese from my home town of Hong Kong? Asians really don't all look the same you know.<br />I've seen comparisons with Wong Kar-wai, and I think that they have some merit. Wong is above all a romantic. So is Sofia Coppola. Wong is a director who focuses on the spirit of place. So does Sofia Coppola. Of course they are different in other ways. Coppola is less self-consciously \\"cool\\" than Wong for one thing. Anyhow, it's a mistake to expect director A to be a dead ringer for director B, and as regards relative merit, Oscars aside it's not a horse race. (I do think her screenplay award was well deserved though).<br />What I like most about \\"Lost in Translation\\" is the love in it. Not only the love between the characters, but the love the writer/director has for her characters, and - yes - for Tokyo. Like all film makers she chooses what to show us to point up the mood of her characters. And she shows us the dissonances between them and the city. I fail to see why some people find the film negative about Japanese. Mostly these are good hearted people having a good time. They are just of a different culture. And yes, some Japanese do enjoy singing Sex Pistols songs in karaoke bars. (Here in HK we might prefer Celine Dion).<br />Personally I don't have much use for the concept of the masterpiece, whether in movies, books, or music. Unless you're talking Shakespeare or Bach or Tolstoy, it's all a bit fan-boy and practically never applies to Hollywood. But there are excellent, good, bad and indifferent films. For me \\"Lost in Translation\\" belongs among the excellent. Murray and Johansson give the performances of their lives, and I must say that like many others I loved the very scenes - including the bed scene -that some question. If only there were more films like this, going to the movies would not be such a chore.
B000000OAC|5.0|As a fan of Mr. Banned's reviews, I also have to put in my $.02 cents worth of this being a recording.<BR> <BR>Queen isn't able to explore as many different genres, or play as many different instruments, or sing as well, or copy Michael Jackson as well as Justin Timberlake, but News Of The World is still passable I suppose. <BR> <BR>The lesser-known hits \\"We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions\\" will never hover amongst the ranks of \\"Senorita\\", but I suppose they'll have to do.  At least Justin's ex-girlfriend has rerecorded \\"We Will Rock You\\" to bring it into the 21st century, but there's only so much you can do with material like this.<br />And Freddie Mercury could kick Justin Timberlake's ass in any dance competition.
B00014NE62|5.0|Since this is one of my all-time favorite films, I was thrilled to find that it was on DVD, especially a 2-disc set, and I snapped it up.  The picture quality of the uncut remastered film itself is gorgeous, but the real value is in the second disc which includes all the interviews, background and deleted scenes.  If you like this film, definitely buy the DVD set!

0385504209|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Goddess worship being banished by the Christian church has rarely received any sort of mainstream attention.  It is time for everyone to acknowledge how the church degraded the status of women and it is still incredibly prevalent in today's androcentric culture.  The facts are solid.  And I would like to say that contrary to the Art Historian's comments below, the Di Vinci preliminary sketches he is referring to are in debate as to whether Di Vinci made those sketches himself, or whether a student of his did.  Much of the evidence points to the fact that those sketches were not made by Di Vinci - and that would explain why they are labeled John instead of Mary.  The sketches of \\"John/Mary\\" also look very masculine - nothing like what the image looks like in the Last Supper. Check out these two articles:<br />[kfki website]<br />\\"This sheet is one of the most remarkable drawings to have been connected with Leonardo. The composition is strongly reminiscent of the Last Supper. One thing there is total agreement about, however, is that the stiff figures were not drawn by Leonardo. But it is possible that he produced preliminary sketches of some of them and that they were drawn by a student. Whatever the case, the mirror writing is a sign that Leonardo used this piece of paper.\\"<br />[metmuseum website]<br />\\"Yet even among drawings of the 1490s, the crudely executed, but definitely left-handed, Last Supper composition sketch in red chalk in Venice (inscribed in Leonardo's right-to-left script) has occasioned fierce debate regarding its authenticity.37 While autograph drawings by Leonardo reveal left-handed parallel hatching (see the discussion below), it does not follow that all drawings with this type of parallel hatching are by Leonardo. Significant in any evaluation is the quality of execution. A number of surviving drawings that are executed in a Leonardesque style and that exhibit the hallmark of Leonardo's left-handedness-the lower right to upper left strokes-are demonstrably not by the master. These range from precise copies by enthusiastic pupils, to later imitations, to downright forgeries. It is known, for example, that Francesco Melzi reinforced drawings by Leonardo that were growing faint because of the physical properties of their medium, especially the studies in red chalk on reddish ocher prepared paper in which the contrasts between drawn form and colored ground are slight.\\"o upper left strokes-are demonstrably not by the master.

0385512104|5.0|From the moment I heard about this book and its subject matter, I was dying to read it... and I was not disappointed.  This murder mystery/ family drama is written from the perspective of Christopher Boone,  a fifteen year old with autism, and his voice is so real and authentic that as  I read I would forget that intellectually normal Mark Haddon was the author and not Christopher himself.<br />When Christopher finds his neighbor's dog, Wellington, impaled on the lawn with a garden fork, he is accused of the crime, mainly due to the police officer's misunderstanding of his autistic behavior.  Before Christopher's father comes to pick him up from the station and he is exonerated, he decides that, like his hero Sherlock Holmes, he will discover who really killed the dog in spite of being warned not to &quot;meddle&quot;.<br />Christopher is a genius at math and has a photographic memory; yet he cannot stand to be touched.  He loves prime numbers and the chapters in the book (which is actually in the form of a journal which his counselor at school encourages him to keep), are numbered that way instead of the usual 1 - 2 - 3.  He has a hard time feeling and relating, yet as Christophter delves deeper into the mystery, he learns many unpleasant surprises about his own family and takes many risks to try to make things right.<br />_The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time_ is exquisitely rendered, complete with drawings and diagrams, in a pure and authentic voice of an autistic teen coming of age.  Besides being wonderfully entertaining, the novel is also educational as I feel I now have new insight into a very misunderstood disorder.  Completely original and thoroughly enjoyable.
B00009NHC5|3.0|Wait Until Dark is another old movie that has sadly lost something as the years go by.  I think the whole style of film making has changed, and as such my generation has grown up with a different idea of what can be done within the realm of celluloid.  This movie is really all build up.  Not to take anything away from the script or the brilliantly put together plot, but it reads like a play adapted for cinema.  The scenes are slow and stay in one location and the movie keeps building to one large climax at the end.  I feel a modern movie would mix it up more, with several denouements and a few more settings.<br />However my main beef with this movie is the overall absurdity, or perhaps naivete of the plot.  3 bad guys want to get a heroin filled-doll off a blind chick.  So they concoct this overly elaborate scenario whereby they trick poor Audrey into thinking her husband killed some broad he had an affair with and this doll could be the only evidence tying him to the crime.<br />I sat there for an hour thinking - is this plausible, or wouldn't thugs like these really have just held her down and beaten her until she told them?<br />So this story creeps on for an hour, brilliant acting, good pacing, but in the end (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) what happens?<br />The baddest bad guy holds her down and beats it out of her!!!  Great. Couldn't you just have done that in the first place.<br />The other weird thing is the relationship between Hepburn and her husband - it think it's supposed to be strong and encouraging, yet through my eyes it appears abusive and derogatory - even when he first sees her after her ordeal he doesn't run to her, he make her (blind, terrified, beaten up, shaking) come to him!!!  Craziness.<br />Audrey deserves better than him and this movie.  File for divorce, spousal abuse, and get your name taken off the credits while you're at it honey.<br />P.S. The baddest bad guy was last spotted playing a psychiatrist in &quot;Gross Point Blank&quot;... He's going up in the world.the world.
0385504209|3.0|Top marks for being a good read and low marks for accuracy.  If the book didn't try to assert that the historical and art references are in fact real, it'd be a more honest work.  Any potential reader just needs to remember the the entire book is fiction and a mystery not a theological treatise
B000002MFN|1.0|One of the most polemic Madonna`s albums, &quot;Erotica&quot; is also one of the weakest, providing some controversy due to its taboo subjects (at least at the time it came out) but failing to engage and surprise on a musical level. Madonna`s image and attitude usually come before her music, and in &quot;Erotica&quot; this is more than evident. Although somewhat stylish and with a cool atmosphere, this record is too flat, linear, unsurprising and forgettable. It seems like a collection of fillers and b-sides with two or three decent songs that appear randomly (the title track and &quot;Rain&quot;, the latter being completely out of place here). Most of the moments here are weak and dated, consisting of quasi trip-hop rythms, club-oriented tracks and pop/jazz/spoken word whispers that recall the early nineties dance scene but aren`t very engaging or captivating songs. Most of them are too cold, distant and create little or no effect. The record is also too long and by the middle of it all the songs seem to sound the same, generating a bland and generic pop album. Despite the shock factor and (anti)hype, &quot;Erotica&quot; is a weak and uninspired effort, a product of its time that doesn`t make much sense today, both musically and thematically.<BR>For fans only, but overall devoid of interest.

B00005JLWN|3.0|A dark and futuristic thriller, &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is a clever and convincing addition to the somewhat tired and repetitive science-fiction genre. <br />In a flawed society after World War III, emotion and feeling are considered the proeminent elements that lead to the collapse and fall of social order, control and organization. So, the best way to avoid a disastrous scenario is to block or destroy any kind of emotion, building an apathetic, controlled and obedient society. <br />Christian Bale plays a special agent whose mission is to kill anyone who dares to defy the rules and actually gets to feel anything, and his task is well suceeded until a point where he starts questioning his system. <br />Director Kurt Wimmer manages to combine diverse references, from George Orwell`s &quot;1984&quot; to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Minority Report&quot; or &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and delivers a consistent and gripping sci-fi thriller, even if its premise isn`t all that innovative. The futuristic society is dark and gloomy as it should, the atmosphere of the movie is dense and claustrophobical enough, the fight scenes are well directed and the plot presents some creativity (the ending, however, is a bit predictable, simplistic and anti-climatic). <br />&quot;Equilibrium&quot; is also a one-man show, where Christian Bale shows (again) that he is an enticing and credible actor, adding depth and presence to a character that could easily have been a cardboard tough guy. <br />Although it`s not as challenging as some of its influences, this cinematic experience is still a strong effort and an unexpected surprise worth discovering.
0316666343|3.0|This novel is very gripping, and it kept me turning the pages for a few chapters. After maybe the sixth chapter, I couldn't take anymore. If you don't care for sadness and horror this book is not for you. The first two chapters,to me, were nauseating.

B00008O31H|5.0|To me, what makes this band so incredible is that these two 20ish white boys from Ohio manage to sound like wizened and grizzled old black men from Mississippi or NOLA, who could sit around and tell you about how they used to jam with Muddy Waters.  But what makes this music consistently listenable is the unique me-fi record quality, the Cream/Hendrix nostalgia, and the down low lyrics that make you feel cool and sexy while you drive down the highway in your minivan on your way to your Corporate American cubeland breadbasket.
B0001HAISG|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this splendidly entertaining and marvelously authentic version of \\"Peter Pan\\" as much as the kids.  Hopefully this will put to bed the absurd notion of adult women playing the title role.  Jeremy Sumpter captures J. M. Barrie's vision of Peter to perfection.  Do yourself a favor and ignore the nitpicking critics and enjoy this wonderful family entertainment.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I was pleasantly surpised by this album.  It is not like what Prince has done on any of his previous albums.  <br />A nice funk-jazz album with alittle rock, and opera chorus thrown in.  This is just the right recipe for a superbly crafted and well thought out album.<br />One can say that this is a \\"concept\\" album of sort because it deals with religion, racism, etc.  Most of the songs are tied in to some narrative - done so cryptically through Prince's slowed down voice.   Others are done through chorus and audience cheer.  <br />Highlights for me are: the title track, Muse 2 The Pharroh, Last December, She Loves Me 4 Me, Family Name, The Everlasting Now, The Work Part 1 & 1+1+1+3.   <br />The other tracks are just as strong.<br />An A++
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies EVER! I don't give a damn what anyone thinks. It's a terrific movie, and the ultimate edition has a s*** load of extras! And if you haven't seen this movie, why not? It's a classic, you HAVE to see it.<br />Everyone knows the story, so I'm not going to go into that here, but the main bit I love throughout the movie, is the fact that Baby seems to almost grow and change the more she falls in love. Plus, Jennifer Grey &amp; Patrick Swayze have some great chemistry together, which they would have to, considering they're together in nearly every scene in the movie.<br />Jennifer Grey is also 27, playing a 17-year-old in this movie. Which she does pretty well, but I never thought she'd be that old! (She's also appeared in a Friends episode, playing Mindy, for all you Friends fans out there - and she's definitely surgery to try and keep her youthful good looks)<br />As I've already mentioned there is a lot of pretty decent extras in this, and also some easter eggs - which I surprisingly enough, managed to find, but that's cos they're pretty obvious, when you're moving around, they highlight! So easier than a lot of easter eggs out there! Included in these extras are: commentary by writer/co-producer Eleanor Bergstein; commentary by Kenny Ortega (choreographer), Miranda Garrison (assistant choreographer and actress Vivian Pressman in the film), Jeff Jur (director of photography), Hilary Rosenfeld (costume designer), and David Chapman (production designer); theatrical trailer(s); trivia track; Jennifer Grey DVD introduction; Jennifer Grey's screen test (so funny!); interviews with Jennifer Grey, Eleanor Bergstein, Kenny Ortega, and Miranda Garrison (overly long and boring); Emile Ardolino tribute; Dirty Dancing Live in Concert (this is an hour &amp; a half long, so get comfortable! It's really good, but I wasn't expecting it to be that long!); music videos: Hungry Eyes, She's Like the Wind, (I've Had) The Time of My Life; exclusive sneak peek of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and collectible packaging (which is pretty much annoying, until you figure out how to get into it!)<br />My favourites out of the extras have to be the concert, and the music videos. And out of the music videos, my favourite is definitely the She's Like The Wind video. It is one of the most subtle, but romantic songs ever. And Patrick Swayze's voice totally suits the song. The video is stunning in black and white.<br />I'm not sure what to think of the sequel to this - Havana Nights. I'll have to wait 'til it comes out, might see it, but the original is such a classic.<br />The ultimate edition is definitely worth paying a wee bit more for. There's also an ultimate edition of the soundtrack out too - both of the soundtracks on one CD. So I have that my eye on that. But if you love these kind of films, and have some taste, add this to your collection.

0385510438|3.0|I had such high hopes for &quot;The Last Juror&quot;.  This novel started off with a bang and then fizzled very quickly.  This was like reading a road map but without a destination.  Having &quot;The Last Juror&quot; as the title was very misleading because I was expecting all types of twists and turns indicative of previous Grisham novels, instead I ended up just grateful that I checked this out of the library.  I cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone buy this book.  Please help your local library's circulation numbers and check it out.  It seems that Mr. Grisham's characters are as tired as he is.  Maybe he doesn't want to play the suspense game anymore.  If that's the case Mr. Grisham please stop writing novels under the cloak of legal suspense and call it a wrap.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Not as if it's hard to make it \\"Their worst album...\\" considering they only have two, but it gets my vote, regardless.  I hate comparing APC to Tool, but honestly, if you like Tool, you'll like this album.  I do.  <br />But, if you like Tool, however you feel A Perfect Circle should try to distance themselves from the kinda artsy, ambient tone that Tool embraces, you'll be disappointed.  I was.<br />This album pales in comparison to Mer De Noms on so many different levels.  I liked Mer De Noms because it was a chance to listen to Maynard use his gift for a more solid act, and step out of the dark, mysterious position he'd made for himself in Tool, and just sing some beautifully orchestrated rock songs. <br />For one, Maynard had a lot more input into these songs than the last, and, whether his intention or not, just turns APC into another Tool.  Yes, Tool fans, shame me for saying it, but Maynard's input - from what I can gather - really drowned out this record.  He should stick to what he does best: Tool, and let Billy brilliantly craft this work, like he did their last.  He'll do fine.  He's just as talented, but in a different way.<BR>In my opinion, I feel this is just another \\"weird, art-rock, bliss, ambient\\" record that I could listen to Tool and get the same feeling, but in odd time signatures.  In fact, Danny Carey is probably the only thing missing from this album that doesn't make it a full-fledged Tool record (kudos to Josh Freese, though...he's a marvelous drummer).<br />Is it a good record?  Yes.  The first three songs are great.  Then it get's kind of boring for me.  I'd rather they kept with the same pace, and expanded the sound of their first record, rather than mellowing down for their sophomore effort.  It's blasphemy in the \\"Tool Fan Kingdom\\" to make some sort of falliable image of any of them.  SOME Tool fans are partially the reason, I've been turned off to the band the last year or so.  Trust me, I used to be that sort of Tool fan that, felt they could do no wrong, and that they were beyond some human level.  But they're not, and so I say again that Maynard should keep his input to a minimum with this band.  He does much better with Tool
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|This movie was absolutely terrible. The plot was practiclly non-existent and what little plot there was, was a load of bs. At no point in the movie does his son make any attempt to separate fact from fiction, yet by the end he suddenly has a tremendous love for his father. There is nothing to be learned from this 2 hours ..., and i feel stupid for wasting (money) and 2 hours of my life on it. Don't buy Big Fish.

Kip is a typical indian with love for his country and family, which reflects without doubt when he gets angry concerning the fact a bomb was put down on BROWN PEOPLE.

B000001Y2U|5.0|If you are just starting to get into Mr. Manson then I suggest you pick up Antichrist Superstar first. Most of the songs on here remain some of Manson's best moments. You have probably heard &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; before, since it was the song that made Manson popular. &quot;Dried Up, Tied &amp; Dead To The World&quot; and &quot;Minute Of Decay&quot; are two of my favorite songs on the album. &quot;Man That You Fear&quot; is Manson's best slow song. I also suggest checking out Mechanical Animals and Portait Of An American Family.
B00009TB5G|4.0|The second installment of a trilogy is always the toughest to pull off. It inevitably lacks the freshness of Part I, and the climax of Part III, and so the best one can hope for is to move the story along, and hope we're all intrigued enough to want to carry on. Peter Jackson solves this dilemma by making the second installment of his LOTR trilogy a cut 'em up, slash 'em up, fast-paced shootout focusing on a series of epic battles. And he does quite well. The film's battle scenes are truly spectacular, both in scope and scale, and Jackson allows his cinematographer to flourish throughout the film, as the New Zealand landscapes dominate the screen. Rarely has such a violent film been so gorgeous to look at.<br />My biggest beefs with this series continue to be a fairly uninspired script that's rife with clichés thinly-masked in archaic lingo, and a dimwitted central character (Frodo) who's not compelling in the slightest. The Two Towers also would have done well not to feature so much of that annoying, incomprehensible, animated creature Gollum, who I found only slightly less contemptible than the dubious Jar Jar Binks of Star Wars infamy. But I quickly forgave this film's flaws and went along for the ride, caught up in the sheer energy of the film, and I found myself enthusiastically looking forward to Part III. Mission accomplished, Mr. Jackson, and a job well done.
B000001Y5X|5.0|Manson's debut album is still one of my favorite cd's. &quot;Lunchbox&quot; and &quot;Get Your Gunn&quot; are great rebellious songs. &quot;Cake And Sodomy&quot; is one of his most explict songs. &quot;Dope Hat&quot; is my favorite song on the whole cd and is also my favorite Manson music video. Don't listen to people who say this album is &quot;immature&quot;, it's better than all the other mainstream crap polluting the music industry today.
B000006TRV|3.0|&quot;The Wall&quot; is a prime example of what happens when one member of a band becomes very bitter and resentful of the world, and creates a narcissistic rock-opera that ends up just not clicking.  ?The Wall? is more a Roger Waters album than a Pink Floyd one.  Indeed, Waters is renowned for his cynical and sympathy-begging songwriting.  The only problem is that he doesn?t go about it in the best way.  John Lennon wrote songs like this, but he could get away with it because he still kept a strong musical sense about him.  Here, Waters just lets his emotions take over entirely.  The result is an eighty-minute rant that really goes nowhere, solves no issues, and only tells a story in the most basic sense of the phrase.  There are some good songs here, the ?Another Brick in the Wall? series, ?Mother?, ?Young Lust?, ?Hey You?, ?Comfortably Numb?, ?In the Flesh??, and ?Run Like Hell? are all listenable, if not fantastic.  Most of the rest is boring, unremarkable, or annoying.  ?Is There Anybody Out There??, ?The Trial?, and ?Outside the Wall? are terrible, pretentious, and disgustingly indulgent piffle.  Despite this, ?The Wall? has earned quite a following.  Perhaps I am missing something, but all I can hear of ?The Wall? is a failed attempt at creating a meaningful and heart-felt statement that is no more than a relic of the times.  It's not Pink Floyd's worst album, but it is nowhere near their best.<BR>~ John Ballantyne
0452282152|3.0|I read the book entitled Girl With the Pearl Earrings written by Tracy Chevalier. Well depending on what type of person you are will alter you opinion of this book. I liked this book, it had a great story line, interesting characters and most imporant in was easy to follow. This book takes you with it. It makes you think your right there wittnessing everything that happens, any book that can do that has to be a great catch.<BR>      This book is based around the life of a young women decending in the world. She is sent to a family where she is to be there maid. She helps an older women clean, cook, and tend to the children. The family she stays with is very wealthy. The father is a well known painter and makes plenty of money off his work. There are five children, two maids and a grandmother living with the couple. the mother of the children is very mean and irritable. She likes no one, and loves to be alone. The father is very reserved and stays most of his time in the studio. As the story goes on Griet, the main character gains a special bond between the painter towards the end of the book it is her she is painting. If you can imagin what it would be like to be a wealthy women having your husband painting pictures of the young maid, when he wouldnt even paint you, you can imagin the conflict that is cause in this what was once calm home.<BR>    This book truly is something to read. I wont by anymeans give the whole story away but i will say it is worth the read. In my mind i give it from one to five a 3.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Chris ( Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) Nielsen are crushed when their two kids Ian (Josh Paddock) and Marie (Jessica Brooks Grant) are killed in an automobile accident. One year later, Chris and Annie are still trying to work through it. If things couldn't get any worse for Annie, Chris is also killed in an automobile accident as well. With her husband and two children gone, Annie does not want to go on living and kills herself. When Chris goes to Heaven, he is confronted by a younger version of his best friend Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr)who explains to him that he died and that he can make Heaven whatever he wants it to be. Unfortunately, he also reveals that Annie has gone to Hell for committing suicide. Chris refuses to accept this, and becomes determined to bring Annie back so that he can spend all of eternity with his wife and two kids.<br />There have been many films that deal with the afterlife. However, I feel that What Dreams May Come did the best job illustrating the afterlife and what it can be like. The special effects are amazing in this film when it comes to showcasing Heaven and Hell. The overall story is extremely powerful because of Chris's determination to save his wife Annie. The film shows that the bond between soul mates is hard to break. This is also an extremely emotional film as well. I was bawling like a baby througout he film, and I rarely cry when watching a movie. All of the main actors - Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Max Von Syndow do a fantastic job in their roles.<br />Overall, What Dreams May Come is an amazing film. All of the actors involved are wonderful, the story is very powerful and emotional, and the special effects create a stunning and creative version of the afterlife. The DVD is very affordable and features amazing picture and sound quality. There is also a making of documentary, an alternate ending, and more.<br />A solid 5 stars...
B000005IU1|5.0|If your one of those people who didnt know that punk existed prior to the ramones untill now, then the first thing to do is to get &quot;Kick out the jams&quot; by MC5. The next thing you must do is buy this impressive debut from the stooges. MC5 were louder, angrier and politically minded, but the stooges made better music. <BR>  <BR>There is only one bad song on this album...yep, its the much hated &quot;we will fall&quot;. The rest is pure gold. The best here is really 1969 and no fun, but its all good. As hard as it might be to believe, this is not their best album! Fun House and Raw power are both better than this, but that doesnt mean that this isnt a masterpiece, because it is.
1572814349|5.0|This deck is so very beautiful, the box is sturdy, the booklet is a nice size and I really like the interpretations, fresh and yet very intuitive. The card stock is firm, but soon becomes easy to handle, the gold gilt edges are truly luxurious. I must say that I was pretty surprised at how reasonable the price is on this deck. I cannot imagine how this was possible, as this deck and book set seem to be of such high quality. U.S. Games System has really outdone themselves in the production of this lovely deck.<br />If you want to see the cards and try a free reading with them visit the artists website; goldentarot.com<br />The artwork on the cards is really gorgeous, I for one did not immediately realize that it is collaged, as each cards imagery is so well integrated. Now a confession, I buy new decks all the time ever searching for that perfect deck which I can actually figure out how to read with. Always there are a few cards which turn me off and send me back to my trusty Rider Waite. This deck is the deck I have been looking for - finally a deck that incorporates the best of RW interpretive imagery, and actually improves on it! If you are comfortable with RW - you will actually find this deck even easier to read with! I never have had such an easy time coming up with interesting insights and more in depth perceptions. Excellent Deck - Highly Reccomended!
B0001611DI|5.0|The re-make ambles into theatres and this disc gets released amid swirls of rumors later in March (?) a DVD DIRECTOR'S CUT will be released as well.  This is the US Theatrical Cut - coming in at 127 minutes.  It features a new DTS soundtrack, anamorphic treatment, and a new commentary from Romero and Savini (with some other guests).  It's low priced, and certainly the best the film has ever looked!  The commentary is great, but there is little else in the special features.  Mainly you get previews, posters, trailers, and radio spots.  But it's worth every penny!  And in a way it is the true director's cut.<br />The edit with 20 minutes added was a rushed job Romero did to preview the film in CANNES.  When he and Dario Argento revisited the movie they decided it needed to be tighter (less talk more ACTION), and two cuts emerged.  One was Romero's US VERSION which hit theatres and remains his true director's cut; meanwhile, you also have a 6 minute shorter slightly more gory less humor Dario Argento ITALIAN CUT.  To muddy waters even more ... when CREEPSHOW was released an R-rated studio cut appeared at drive-ins as part of a double bill!  So there are many cuts out there.<br />But what makes the film survive and even get remade?  Pure and simple it's a monster movie where humans are the ultimate monsters.  And it's not always the zombies that do the awful stuff -- infact, it's surprising how human they appear in contrast to the inhumane looters that appear in the climax.  Shopper zombies trapped in a mall?  That's the obvious satire.  But the film has so many layers!  Racism, sexism, consumerism, religion, the media, the government, scientific thought -- it all gets eaten alive here.  Sure it's dated and slower than most horror movies these days.  The remake will speed up the zombies ala 28 DAYS LATER!  But this one remains what it is -- an intelligent masterful excercise in horror.  \\"A movie that not only goes for the jugular, but rips it out and eats it for good measure!\\"d measure!\\"
0142000663|5.0|I'm shocked I was never forced to read it in High School.  However, I think by reading it some years later I likely have a better understanding and appreciation for the book.  Steinback's writing is truly impressive - each detail provided so that the reader really feels a part of the story.  You feel the pain and sacrifice of the family... you share in their small joy and heartache.  Lives up to its &quot;classic&quot; standing without a doubt...the Grapes of Wrath is my new favorite.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The original Matrix is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen - Timeless, incredibly well thought out... Simply brilliant.<br />The Matrix Reloaded was long, boring, unimaginative and simply a way to make money off the hype built up on the first one. The only highlight in the whole movie was that it had Monica Bellucci (stunning) and somehow they even managed to make her look plain (I have no clue how they did it but they did...)<br />My advice is that it's one of those movies that one has to watch simply because everyone else has seen it but I would never own it. Very disappointing. Very...
0385335482|2.0|A friend suggested I read this &quot;light&quot; novel for fun and I found this book incredibly boring.  The heroine, Rebecca Bloomwood, has a fluffy personality and doesn't even have her head on straight when it comes to her work as a financial writer. Her thought process in making valid reasons why she is a compulsive shopper were humourous in the beginning but half way through the book, I was getting tired of having the same old point drilled to me that Rebecca buys things to compensate for self worth. <br />&quot;Confessions&quot; is unrealistic and the other characters in the book are not developed enough to make it worthwhile to remember their names. This book is understandably meant to be just a quick read.
B000060P79|4.0|When you read most other reviews they talk about why they like or don't like the CD.  This review is all about you.  And if you would like this CD.  I like it.  You would probably like it if you like Good Charlotte, Blink-182, Sum-41, American Hi-Fi, New Found Glory or any other punk-rock group.  Don't pay attention to the cover...it tells you nothing about the CD.  It gives them a horrible image to people new to the group and I don't think it was a good choice.  If you are someone who really thinks about music, then you will hate the CD.  they are a group you want to listen to without much thought.  They do have pretty basic instrumentals...but that's another reason why the music is good.
B000002KGT|5.0|\\"Rumours\\", released in 1977, is said to be not only Fleetwood Mac's best album but also one of the top 20 best albums in music history.  Such quality answers why it's sold 18 million US copies and 30 million worldwide copies.  They rightfully won the Grammy for Album of the Year.  In the US, it stayed #1 on Billboard Top 200 Albums Charts for 31 weeks.  It spawned four top 10 hits: \\"Dreams\\", \\"You Make Loving Fun\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", and \\"Don't Stop\\".  The album's seems-to-be-simple pop/rock beats offer smooth flowing rhythms that remain unique and catchy today.  Its slight genre variety gives twists and turns throughout the album: pop, rock, country, folk, and celtic.  Yet, they stay true to their main genre and themselves.  This album has influenced many musicians that came after them; however, few have beat its quality.<br />All five members perform their instruments uniquely, which adds to the musical flavor.  Lindsay Buckingham's unforgettable guitar picking by using his fingers offers a unique sound that many have tried to mimick.  Such makes the guitar solos better.  Mick Fleetwood's drumming is never too hard, never too soft.  It's perfect in every beat, flowing with the theme.  John McVie's overlooked bass sound is great, especially when performed solo.  Christine McVie's keyboard skills flow perfectly with the remaining instruments.  The vocalists offer their own perspective to the theme.  <br />Regardless who's singing leads, they're always at their top.  Switching lead vocalists offer a variety of themes throughout \\"Rumours\\".  Lindsay Buckingham's forceful, but not too forceful, words offers the aggressive side of the band.  Christine McVie's soulful, smooth words offer the mellow side.  Stevie Nick's unique deep, mysterious words offer the emotional side to everything.  Whoever writes the lyrics sings lead vocals.  The soulful lyrics wonderfully express the turmoil brought upon the band during recording: divorce, break-ups, fighting, etc.  They never hold back a single drop of emotion.  It's amazing that through the tensions among the band members, they can still make a triumphant album.<br />\\"Rumours\\" is the essential album for every Fleetwood Mac fan to own.  The quality answers why people are still listening to it.  This classic album will surely continue pleasing listeners for many more years.  Fans of this album should also purchase their 1988 release \\"Greatest Hits\\".  Such combination makes a great music experience.
B00005JMFO|4.0|[Actually, my rating is 3.5 stars.]<br />No one can deny the fact that Richard Curtis is one of the best screenwriters in the world.  And yes, \\"Love Actually\\" confirms the fame again.  But as to his directoral skills, \\"Love\\" actually shows that it is short of the ones' such as Roger Mitchell who did in \\"Notting Hill.\\"  In short, good, but not great.<br />\\"Love Actually\\" has many (including potential) couples in love, and too many, I am afraid.  Hugh Grant as Prime Minister of UK is in love with his chubby secretary while Emma Thompson plays a wife of Alan Rickman, in whose office Laura Linney works, who is in love with a hunky guy, and so on and on.  However, though the film includes the stars like Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, and Liam Neeson, the screentime alloted to each actor is too short for any character they play to fully engage our attentions.<br />That does not mean the film is boring.  On the contrary, it has a lot of witty dialogues of Richard Curtis, the same kind of funny lines you enjoyed in \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\\"  But as you keep watching on, you will probably some stories should be left in the cutting room.  Actually, two (or three) couples' stories are not interesting at all.  And the slightly political satire on the US-UK relation (represented awkwardly by the US President Billy Bob Thornton) clearly sticks out.  We need romance here, not political comments, even wrapped with laughter.<br />Among the many actors, it is Bill Nighy who steals the show, as an ex-rocker whose acid tongue cannot be kept silent even on the air.  The way how this down-and-out, die-hard rocker sings his awful version of \\"Love Is All Around\\" (used in \\"Four Wedding\\" by Wet Wet Wet) is a real pleasure to see, and you can find him in every funny moment of the film.<br />\\"Love Actually\\" is too long, and its story clutters with too many characters.  It is a fun to see it, but no one would complain if Richard Curtis concentrate his enormous talent on writing only in the future.

B0000AI44Q|1.0|A friend lent me this project and not to sound as clichd as the CD but with friends like this who needs enemies, or sleeping pills for that matter. Neil, who is Canadian born, chooses this fictitious town, Greendale, to preach the evils of Capitalism. If that's the case, then Neil sure sounds like a proponent of Socialism. Well then I'd love to ask Neil why he left his native Socialist country Canada in the first place. The answer my friend is CASH. Why do any of these musicians come to America? It's all about reaping the rewards of Capitalism while railing against the tenants of truth (that it's actually good) at the same time. Although I had an idea about it's content and message, I satisfied my liberal friend and watched this mess unfold. I was screaming for it to end after 10 minutes. This is not only unwatchable because of the political slant it's just boring. Unimaginative music and lyrics combine to create a story that only Neil and maybe Michael Moore could enjoy. Hey Neil, if you feel so strongly about the evils of Capitalism why not just make this a free download? Oh, sorry, I forgot you are a hypocrite.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Perhaps if 'A music fan from USA' (a.k.a. Britney's agent-that's my guess) logged off and got her some voice lessons rather than typing in bogus reviews she would have a chance against vocal superstars like Jones and others.
B00005JKCH|3.0|The movie is loud, boring, awesome and breathtaking at the same time. The Movie is OK though I really hate the green goblin actor he annoys the crap out of me, if he wasnt in it, it'll e a different story. The movie is a dullishly ok version of the comic. THE DVD features are amazing though! It is absolutely awesome! The E! Documentary is a highlight<br />Overall<br />Movie : 3 / 5<br />Special Features: 5+++/ 5
0062502182|5.0|Everyone has a personal destiny and target in life. Whether we follow our dreams and fortune or not can depend on accomplishing that mission. But we almost always need that inspiration to help us start. The Alchemist by Paolo Coelho was one of the most inspiring books I've ever read. <BR>      The book tells the story of a boy, looking for the answer to his dreams, his target in life, his truth. It tells of overcoming impatience, learning about love, following your dreams and feelings, and repeating mistakes and situations. Along his journey, both physical and spiritual, he meets a number of interesting and guiding people: an alchemist, a king, and a gypsy woman, introducing to him the concepts of knowledge, certainty, love. The boy learns a lot, just by traveling, by analyzing the events that seem to happen to him over and over again, the way he is guided. He realizes that following his dreams means sacrifices and believing in yourself. Coelho has outdone himself with this wonderful book, which provokes all emotions to come to the surface of the one who reads it. He brings up concepts of destiny, of faith, of the long journey to accomplish your own personal mission in life. I really enjoyed this book, and it has guided me in many ways and situations since I read it. I would recommend it to anyone, it will help those who seek answers to their philosophical questions.
B0000W3YIS|5.0|I have this one, Believe me, if you dont have this, it is reccomended soooo much!, with 2 Extra tracks to die for this album is amazing, hence its 4 1/2 star rating!. The original album is awesome with cool songs, the bonus songs rock aswell! &quot;The Answer&quot;,and &quot;DontHang UP&quot; are cool! This is 100% reccomended and is one album you should not go by. Toxic is a definite highlight!!!!. Go buy this now people!!!.
B00006879E|5.0|Saw Maroon 5 open for John Mayer in Tampa which lead me to buying this album. This group brings something fresh. I hope this is just a hint of what is to come, but if not, this album will hold its strength in displaying a talent pool with combination of rock and R &amp; B (in my opinion with a nod more to the rock side). They have plenty of energy. Kudos to Maroon 5!
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears Improves so much on her Third, yes THIRD album!, The Songs have changed drastically from her first two albums, no more mrs. nice innocent britney!, Noooo way!, you will know what I am talking about If you have seen the \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" Video!. Her songs are dirtier filled with sex, love and ballads, well not much sex but the videos sure are!. I do not agree with people who think this CD is unsuitable for kids, OK so its not what she used to sing, big deal but with Eminem around they still listen to him , why not Britney!, she is just as cool as ever in this awesome CD, The highlights of \\"Britney \\"Are<br />Im a Slave 4 U<br />Overprotected<br />Lonely<br />I Love Rock'n'Roll<br />ANTICIPATING!<br />LET ME BE!<br />What Its Like To Be Me<br />When I Found You<br />One track which is definitley cringe--worthy is<br />I'm not a girl, not yet a woman!<br />And I know alot of people will agree though it an OK song<br />Overall<br />100%<br />5/5<br />5 stars<br />10/10<br />Bueno<br />Exellent<br />Exellente<br />AMAZING<br />Get It Now people!
B000002J03|5.0|this is a very heavy, bluesy album, with a few exceptions of course. Whole Lotta Love is a heavy opener and a bit psychadelic at times. What Is and what should never be is a bit more laid back. i bit more hippie than heavy. The Lemon son is a great original blues song. very heavy. Thank You is a lovely ballad. a nice change. Heartbreaker, another heavy one. flows right into Living Loving Maid. it was definitely intended for release as a single. it's a bit 60's-ish. it doesn't seem out of place on the album cause it flows. a good fun song though. Ramble On, another laid back one. Hippie. i like this one cause you can really hear the bass. a few references to tolkien, but doesn't bombard you with them like the songs on LZ IV. Moby Dick starts of funky, then it's the amazing 3 min drum solo. Sounds a bit more like Traffic than Zepplin. Bring it on home starts as straigtht foward blues then evolves into classic LZ. overall, i have nothing negative to say about any of the songs. this albums great. it's worth spending money on.
6305291489|5.0|This movie is one of the best Disney has ever released it is funny heart warming and just plain cute. Lindsay Lohan is adorable (playing dual roles Annie from London and Hallie from California), I think this was one of Lindsays best work ever. This movie is a true classic
B00008VGK0|4.0|I didn't like the original album version of this song, But I thought of giving it another try, especially because Madonna always- over the past 6 years has teamed up with several of the most grand Music producers such as William Orbit (whom helped produce the ''Ray Of Light'' album) and then you get others like Peter Rauhofer, Victor Calderone, Paul Oakenfold, Richard Humpty, Tracy Young, Deepsky, Mac Quayle, Hex Hector...etc. <br />So I bought this, and I was very surprised with the remixes which clearly outshine the original version of this song. Paul Oakenfold's Mix is without doubt the best remixed version of American Life, the way her vocals are combined with semi-rap tempo beats is in fact cool and luscious. <br />And Felix Da Cat's Mix is quite a impressive and thump mix, Her vocals especially the ''Ohhh American Life'' chorus sounds rather dreamy and very refreshing. <br />Peter Rauhofer's Anthem Pt.2 Mix is a delicious refined and speedy mix. This one after Paul Oakenfold's Mix is the second best on this album. <br />And... by the worse?, I like Missy Elliots music, she's cool....but the mix here...is terribly noisy and it doesn't make a real good contribution towards the song.<br />Richard Humpty's completely revamped Mix of Die Another Day is awesome, It's a pity there weren't more remixes of Die Another Day added.<br />So all in all, this is quite a remarkable Maxi Single.
0393037010|5.0|I read the book and I like it a lot because, I like intrigue and action books. The writer writes the book in a way that takes you into the novel and you feel that you're one of the characters in the novel , you get action and you get intrigue. The theme of the book is conflict and war. My favourite part is when he's fighting the French's and during the cease of fire, he found a solution on how to bet the French's by imitating insect's behaviour. I recommend this novel to people who like action and intrigue and for person that like to feel that they can relate with the main character... Joe brother's come to Basel it is the best place in the world we're waiting for you...
B00004X01U|3.0|After the release of 1998's ''Ray Of Light'', Madonna re-appeared in the year 2000 with another album ''Music'' which consists of 10 tracks. I must say, that after purchasing the 3 latest albums of Madonna, ''Music'' was the one I disliked the most. I know I said that I was disappointed with 2003's ''American Life'' but the work there has a better variety of tracks, with much better lyrics, there are tracks on American Life such as ''Nothing Fails'', ''Nobody Knows Me'', ''Mother And Father'', ''Intervention'', ''Hollywood'' and the title track ''American Life'' which noticeably outshine most of the remaining work from this album.<br />My Favorites Are-<br />Music. The title track however is a cool dance track, possibly one of the best nightspot tunes Madonna has delivered in her entire career along with ''Hollywood'' from American Life.<br />Don't Tell Me. This track is a mixture of easy-going R&B, Pop and a tad Country sound. This is a good track, her vocals sound pleasant, clear and refreshing.... whether as on the awful ''Impressive Instant'' her voice sounds repugnant.<br />What It Feels Like For A Girl. Technically, lyrically and vocally, this is undeniably the best song on this album, it's possible to be compared to some of the tracks from ''Ray Of Light''. It's quite sad, and has significant lyrics that make sense and makes you think for instance; parts of the song....she states more or less that for a boy to look like a girl is degrading...which makes you think being a girl can be just as degrading, the whole concept is a bit unclear but otherwise- musically this is truly one of Madonna's best masterpieces.<br />Paradise (Not For Me). This song, was by far the best from this album along with track 8. It's a very recurring track of ''Mer Girl'' and ''Has To Be'' except this one summons some easy going beats, semi trip-trop and rock sounding. A few of her vocals are ciphered, it sounds almost as if they are drowning under erratic sound effects and to me thatis very interesting. On-top of that you have consequential lyrics which (If I'm Correct) describe cruelty and death adjacent to women. In French it mentions something about being surrounded by angels, and speeding from life to death. It's very haunting. A Video was recorded for it and for ''Mer Girl'' too (Which I might add, is two of the most scariest Videos ever by Madonna)...they were both promos for the [Drowned World Tour]. Unfortunately this was not a single.<br />So, I'd give this album 5 stars just for the decent tracks included here. ''American Life'' lyrically and vocally was a healthier album, which received allot more attention probably because Madonna started up great tons of Controversy with being Anti-War, and giving a sexually wicked performance with Britney Spears, X-Tina Aguilera and Missy Elliot at the MTV VMA Awards 2003.
0441009425|5.0|This story is great, detailed, complex and a wonderful first book by ANY standards.  The author's novel reminds me of works from such greats, such as Frank Herbert, Steven Brust and C.S.Friedman.  Alien yet familiar, with real characters, full of plans, fears, merits and flaws.  Who is the puppet and who is the master, becomes just one of the questions that starts to form in the mind while reading this book.  This is a work, not just of the pen, but of a highly skilled mind, crafted carefully with the tools of the English language and with love of the science fiction setting itself.  Plots within plots within plots, in a universe so will formed, with characters so well designed, with events so well timed, that you won't know what's going to really happen till the last page.<br />And he has more books out there!
B00000F1D3|5.0|If you ask me?. The year 1998/1999 were probably one of the best years in the entire music history. There was so much good music to choose from, whether as today the range of choice is very small.<br />Cher's ''Believe'' along with Madonna's ''Ray Of Light'' were both probably the best released albums in the year 1998. I have never again managed to enjoy an album the way I enjoyed those two and I'm glad that both albums won very deserving Grammy's. This one having winning the ''Best Dance Album'' of the year.<br />I will never forget when I rushed out to the Music store after hearing it on the radio, I had to wait 1 week before I was able to buy the CD, because nearly every music store I went to in Center town told me that they had sold out of ''Believe''. And Talking About Videos? ''Believe'' in my opinion was one of the coolest Videos back in the 90's.<br />1. Believe. Produced at ''Dream House Studios'', received first quality in digital technology. The way the song starts off is very reflecting then it taps into delicious and sharp disco beats which build up to her vocals. Very Hot dance track.<br />2. The Power. This track features Cher in her semi mystical and pop state. This is a good track, but the remaining tracks on this album clearly outshine this one.<br />3. Runaway. This is really a potent & powerful track, I was so disappointed when I heard it wasn't going to be released as single, It was released as a promo but didn't manage to get enough attention. If you want to hear something rather sad and mind-blowing then you'd like this track.<br />4. All Or Nothing. This track, which was produced by the ''Metro'' crew with the influence of Todd Terry (If I'm correct). This was the third single off this album, it was released while Cher was doing the ''Believe'' Tour in Las Vegas. Two Videos were released for this track, One of them was for the ''Metro Radio Remix'' which included missing scenes from ''Strong Enough'' and ''Believe'' combined into one video (the Remix video was only released in 3 continents) and the other video which was a worldwide release which contained assorted shoots from the Las Vegas tour.<br />5. Strong Enough. I remember witnessing the ''Thunderpuss Mix'' being played in discothèques, and on the radio several times. It was also great for the opening to the ''Believe'' tour in Las Vegas which was accompanied by a really Hot Remix Flash/Dance video. When this song starts off, you get the impression that it's a slow and easy-going song when BAM! ''Cos I'm Strong Enough'' and the more relaxed disco beats kick in, and her vocals become very challenging and warm.<br />6. Dov'e l'amore. A Cool Latin influenced ballad, but I also do remember that Emilio Estefan Jr.'s Mix received allot more attention than the original that it was used for the video- and the video was kinda cute, Cher decides to make herself look Spanish and she did a real good job with it.<br />7. Takin' Back My Heart. This is a somewhat very mellow and relaxing track, It's cool.<br />8. Taxi Taxi. WOW!, This track and ''Believe'' are probably the two best on this album which easily get you grooving and off your feet. Her vocals are very demanding, the song is rather a little sexual same as ''All Or Nothing'' with pounding house beats thrown in. This is a very stirring track. Everyone I know, who've got this album, couldn't stop raving about how awesome ''Taxi Taxi'' was.<br />9. Love Is The Groove. This is a dance ballad, with very cool lyrics and her vocals sound undeniably dreamy in this track.<br />10. We All Sleep Alone. Well, no need to make a big fuss of this one, seeing its a previously released track of Cher's but revamped for the dance floors, and its quite a quality and thump mix, which definitely sounds like a Todd Terry or Deep Dish Remix.<br />So....here Cher is, Stirring the atmosphere in the center of the dance floor.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Neil the Hippy from British sitcom \\"The Young Ones\\" uttered those immortal words, and he could have been explaining what was so awful about the final instalment of the Matrix trilogy.<br /><br />By not saying much and implying a great deal with a huge amount of style, the thinnest veiled reference to Rene Descartes and some very snappy kung fu sequences, the Wachowski brothers made a certified classic of motion picture history in \\"The Matrix\\".<br /><br />The Matrix Reloaded revealed more, but still mostly just hinted at great depth of learning and profundity. Many - myself included - were sufficiently taken in to declare the film a success, and noted that even if the philosophising was cod, it was a hell of a car chase. Knowing what I now know, I still think reloaded was, on the balance, a successful film.<br /><br />But the Matrix Revolutions? Oh dear, oh dear. (What follows might contain \\"spoilers\\" - but to my mind what the real spoiling here was carried out by L and A Wachowski).<br /><br />In any case, gone are the clever insinuations (for example that Merovingian might be the devil because his wife is Persephone - as in wife of Hades, lord of the underworld in Greek Mythology) and instead you're thumped between the eyes with the fact (this time, the elevator button to his floor is marked \\"HELL\\".)<br /><br />Gone is any semblance of continuity from the last film. Persephone is back with Merovingian, despite seemingly irreconcileable differences. Merovingian is running some sort of S&M club. The indestructible albino dreadlock dudes are gone. He employs a train man, for no obvious purpose (other than to bamboozle and perplex). There is a confusing sequence with an Indian family who meets Neo while waiting at at underground station.<br /><br />And there is way, way, way too much pointless fighting. Now I like a good punch-up as much as the next man, but there needs to be some raison d'etre, or at least some outcome, for crying out loud.<br /><br />In place of the grand car chase we have an action finale that is such a blitzkrieg of overheating pentium processors, gattling guns and exploding squids, that for twenty minutes for all you know your TV might be on the blink (what an irony that so much computing horsepower and intricate programming leads to such an incoherent visual spectacle). And at the end of it the squids just leave as a result of a conversation taking place hundreds of miles away. Dramatically satisfying it ain't.<br /><br />Finally, the whole intellectual superstructure of the trilogy reveals itself to be so much horse manure. what you thought you understood no longer make sense; the pseudo-religious angle is ditched; central tensions betweeen characters are undermined, characters die and come back to life; characters turn out to be immortal and not susceptible of being killed (which defeats the purpose of fighting, non?) and in any case you really just couldn't care a hill of beans for any of them, least of all Larry Fishburne.<br /><br />The most pernicious aspect is that by throwing in the philosophical towel, Revolutions undermines the previous instalments of the trilogy which, until you see this one, had for the most part, got away with it.<br /><br />As they would say in Britain, complete and utter pants.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonblitzkrieg of overheating pentium processors, gattling guns and exploding squids, that for twenty minutes for all you know your TV might be on the blink (what an irony that so much computing horsepower and intricate programming leads to such an incoherent visual spectacle).

B000002NJS|5.0|Ray Of Light is without doubt Madonna's finest work from her lifetime career. There are only a few tracks which can be compared to any of the work from this album, for instance tracks like ''Paradise (Not For Me)'', ''Love Don't Live Here Anymore'' and ''I Want You''.<br />I haven't liked a CD of hers this much except for ''Something To Remember'' which I might add is one of the most depressing collections of songs that Madonna has gathered together. The ''Ray Of Light'' CD I purchased is the import CD, but I decided to review this one since the Import did not receive allot of attention (Unfortunately). So before I give you an idea how satisfying this album is, I would like to say that on the import CD there is a bonus track ''Has To Be'' and I cannot come to the conclusion to understand why this track was left out from the original record, it is by far one of the best tracks Madonna ever recorded. I can still understand why ''Revenge'' was not added to the album, because although it has very good lyrics, the rest of the album including ''Has To Be'' clearly outshine it. So therefore you should try and get the Japanese Import CD of ''Ray Of Light''. <br />I'm going to give you a hint about some of the songs that are included on this album......<br />Drowned World (Substitute For Love), is a very consequential ballad, which describes not being able to have a personal life without the press hounding you, I think the video of this song was based on Princess Diana, although it was not mentioned as a dedication.<br />Mer Girl, is the album at its most dramatic point, a track which Madonna dedicated to her lost mother. She delivers the vocals dreamingly and expressively, its the kind of song you will hear playing in a very dramatic film.<br />Shanti (Ashtangi), is a North African &amp; Arabic influenced track, very up-beat and rhythmic- also tends to have allot of Brazilian subjective beats and sound effects, very mystical sounding I would say, but an out-and-out good track.<br />Ray Of Light, being the title track; Is a very energetic semi-house track which summons allot of erratic and electronic sound effects, and then of course you have Madonna's vocals which sound very circulate and inspiring. (Note: The Calderone Remix of this song, is totally awesome, try and get the CD-Single).<br />Nothing Really Matters, has more of a pounding beat thrown in, with very assuring vocals and lyrics.<br />Frozen, is a exceptionality good track, which sounds undeniably dreamy, sensational and above all- a VERY interesting track if you ask me. The video for this song is my #1 favorite video by Madonna, my #2 favorite is  ''Love Profusion'' where she looks absolutely gorgeous with shouldered blonde hair.<br />Sky Fits Heaven, sounds allot like ''Ray Of Light'', it's definitely energetic and captivating if you're a big fan of Dance, Techno, House. The lyrics and vocals are very choral-sounding and reflective.<br />(Now here comes the real treat)....<br />The Power Of Goodbye, is without doubt the best song on this album. It sounds very haunting, emotional, dreamy, and rather a bit sad. The music effects are very compelling, the kind you'd hear on a Massive Attack CD. This is my personal favorite and although it can be viewed as a sad song...It is the most beautiful song I have heard by Madonna. Truly incredible...<br />The remaining songs on this CD are quite fine tracks but- ''To Have And Not To Hold'' and ''Candy Perfume Girl'' aren't very alluring. <br />This Album is for anyone who liked Cher's [Believe]. Both [Believe] and [Ray Of Light] won very deserving Grammy's, this one was the winner for best Pop album of the year.
0446608955|1.0|I read this book. When I first picked it up, I honestly thought that I had mistakenly purchased a copy for those readers who are visually impaired! The type was so large and the margins on the page were huge! As I contined to read, I realized why: Nicholas Sparks has nothing to say. He is riding the wave of the Bridges of Madison County, &quot;romance lite&quot; books -- those kind of small, shallow books that is taking advantage of American readership these days. He knows our attention spans aren't what they used to be, that we're not really that bright and certainly don't like to be challenged intellectually, so he is laughing at us all the way to his bank while publishing this fiction that passes off for books. This was the most revolting, insulting book I have ever read, and actually made me ashamed that I invested the time and money to read it.
B000089RVX|5.0|After being terribly disappointed with the majority of the music from last year, except for a handful of artists who made really great albums like Annie Lennox, Sting and some of Madonna's releases weren't too bad.<br />So I decided to put pop and rap aside for a while, and explore further into some more sophisticated music like   Tracy Thorn (From EBTG), Massive Attack, Portishead and along with those 3, I chose Evanescence too.<br />One of my main reasons why I bought this albums?, was because Amy Lee's vocals are unquestionably haunting and painful if you pay attention to the tunes and clearly understand the concept of the lyrics, which describe going through hell for many miserable reasons.<br />My favorite tracks are: 2. Bring Me To Life, 4. My Immortal, 9. Hello, 7. Imaginary, 5. Haunted. The rest are overall good, but those are my favorite of the whole selection.<br />The music is extraordinary, well written and makes a good contribution to music. It's very expressive emotionally, warningly, depressively and lyrically it describes the cruel reality of which exists throughout the world<br />5 stars for this album, let's hope Evanescence/Amy Lee's next album will be just as good as this one and perhaps maybe even better. And I think the Videos are all cool, Amy Lee looks exceptionality gorgeous in ''My Immortal''.

068983571X|5.0|This is a great mystery novel - probably Sherlock Holmes' best - and a good thriller in its own right.  Arthur Conan Doyle creates a genuinely creepy atmosphere by his setting on the English moors and the legend of the demonic hound.  Of course, being a Holmes story, most things end up with a rational explanation, but there is good, honest, Victorian terror along the way.  Reading it, I was struck by how much it must have influenced the movie, An American Werewolf in London.<br />Conan Doyle has a wonderful, economic prose style and his Holmes stories always move at a quick pace.  The only maddening thing is how much time Sherlock himself spends off-stage.  I guess Conan Doyle treats the character the way most authors treat villains - only allowing the reader glimpses of him.  I guess that is because Sherlock's mind is so atypical, he is ultimately unknowable to us.  In this story, Holmes has to stay behind in London for a while, so he sends the very competent Dr. Watson to Baskerville hall to investigate the strange goings-on.
0060977493|4.0|I really love Arundhati Roy's writings. Her political commentaries are always insightful and offer a refreshing new perspective on things. Her debut novel, &quot;The God of Small Things,&quot; was a smash hit and rightly so. It is a very well written and intriguing novel. That said a sense of depression pervades the novel, which whilst essential to the tone and plot, can be a bit overbearing for the reader. Its a tragic novel about survival, grief and abandonment. It must be said that there are almost no male characters with redeeming features in this novel. Theres a subtle Indian feminist message in this novel and its one that should be heard. Through Ammu , Roy is arguing that an adult woman without a husband is extremely vulnerable in Indian society. Ammu's suffering and the effect it has on her children is a plea for such injustice to be remedied. The God of Small Things is not a perfect novel, but if you want to be well read this book is a worthy addition to your collection.
067941715X|4.0|One of Jane Austen's best attributes as a writer is her rapier wit and sense of humor, which especially shows itself in her earlier novels, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.  &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, which preceded both of them but was published only after her death, is a clever parody of the Gothic novel as written by Anne Radcliffe: full of dark, stormy nights, ancient castles with secret passages and locked rooms hiding unspeakable crimes, damsels in distress, and all the rest.  Austen's heroine, Catherine Morland, has read a few too many such books, and we meet her at the age of seventeen, emerging from the chrysalis of adolescence as a passably pretty young woman with her head full of romantic notions and not much else.  When she meets the hero of her dreams, Henry Tilney, a surprisingly level-headed young man, Catherine realizes that life as melodrama is a poor second to life in reality.  Catherine is fascinated at the prospect of visiting Northanger Abbey -- what mysteries and horrors must be waiting to be discovered -- only to be brought up short by the pedestrian intrusion of real life (a locked cabinet which might have held vials of poison or, even better, a skeleton, turns out to hold nothing more dangerous than a laundry list).<br />&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a good first novel but it is by no means Jane Austen's best, and Catherine is not as interesting a heroine as Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Watson or Elinor Dashwood; she's a somewhat shallow, undeveloped young lady who lacks their depth and their intelligence.  But she's a likeable heroine; unlike Fanny Price, Catherine doesn't try to be perfect nor judge others for failing to be so, and unlike Emma Watson, she's not meddling in everyone else's business.  She can admit when she's at fault and she has a generous spirit.  We like to imagine her as the tomboy Austen pictures her in her childhood, rolling down hills and chasing her brothers and sisters.  Austen provided a number of interesting supporting characters: Henry's amiable sister Elinor, his insufferably snobbish and narrow-minded father General Tilney, and the artful, heartless flirt Isabella Thorpe.  By the book's end, Catherine has grown up a bit; she sees life as it is and realizes Henry's steady common sense is infinitely preferable to the histrionics of any Gothic hero.  Jane Austen's first book was a promising introduction of better things to come.provided a number of interesting supporting characters: Henry's amiable sister Elinor, his insufferably snobbish and narrow-minded father General Tilney, and the artful, heartless flirt Isabella Thorpe.

B00005A0N5|5.0|Awesome CD. What I tend not to like about some metal is that its just noise and not music. This is definetly not the case for Nightwish and this CD. The only thing I was not so fond of was the guest vocalist that everyone gripes about. It wasn't too horrid though. My personal two favorites were Stargazers and Moondance. There are no songs that make me go &quot;Ugh!&quot; and change the song.<br />Stargazers - I've always loved this song. Very awesome.<br />Gethsemane - I like the instruments in this song. <br />D &amp; DDO - A little odd.. The male vocalist sounds kinda cool in the beginning, and then just gets to be too much. Still a good song.<br />Sacrament of Wilderness - This song is super fast. Very good.<br />Passion and the Opera - Good song. <br />Swanheart - This song reminded me of a Christmas carol, I don't know why. It was just so mellow. Still a good song.<br />Moondance - (instrumental) One of my personal favorites.<br />The Riddler - Fast + Heavy. Awesome song.<br />Pharaoh Sails to Orion - I really like the beat to this one. <br />Walking in the Air - Its not as fast as Sacrament of Wilderness, but still very good.

B000060P79|1.0|I'm not going to sit here and argue what genre of music that it falls into.  Whether it's skater punk, or pop punk, or whatever doesn't really matter to me.  The bottom line is that it's supposed to be music, and it's pretty much failed to accomplish that task.<br />I'll admit that I did listen to the CD twice because they tunes were catchy, but I'm not really looking for catchy.  I'm looking for musical talent (probably because I'm a music major).  I listened to this CD and there was absolutely nothing that impressed me musically.  All the songs were in basic 4/4 meter, there was an excessive use of \\"power chords,\\" and most of the songs were in the same key.  The intrumentalism was lacking.<br />The lyrical content is nothing to be impressed about either.  The basic ideas from the punk scene are just being recycled over and over again with this band.  Those ideas being \\"My parent's don't understand,\\" \\"I need a girlfriend,\\" \\"I don't want to be like you,\\" and \\"I don't know what path to take.\\"  So obviously this music is appealing to the typical high school croud of people that are going through some emotional transition stages in their lives, I just don't think that recycling these concepts over and over again is anything special.  Bottom line is that Simple Plan is really keeping it simple and not trying to have any originality.<br />So you take a lack of musical talent, a lack of originality, a bunch of pretty boys, and a lead singer that sounds like he sucked down on some helium and you've got a punk band.  It's nice to see what music is coming to.
B0001611DI|4.0|I watched my recently purchased DIVIMAX edition on a television that is almost 10 years old, and I was blown away at the pix quality. I have never seen the other DVD transfers, but I have of course seen it on video and sat.tv, nothing has come close to this edition. Same goes for the audio. <BR>       As for the commentary I greatly enjoyed it,finding it insightful, funny, and somewhat educational. Romero despite his successes still made this film using guerrilla moviemaking tactics. The other extras, mostly trailers,t.v. spots, and something you dont always see..radiospots are all well reproduced. If you dont have a copy of this film then I highly recommend this cut,if you have one you may want to hold out until the &quot;alleged&quot; rerelease of a heavier loaded edition this Oct.

0385504209|3.0|This book should have been a screen play.  It would (or will) be a blockbuster movie, but the book lags, the characters are cardboard, and the plot development is uninteresting.  However, the ideas and history behind the book are exciting.  I had neither considered many of the symbols in art history before nor have I thought that the holy grail might be a person and not the cup of Christ.<br />This is a quick read, but the writing quality isn't good enough to make this a classic.
B00005JLPK|4.0|Mmmmm, how to review this film.<BR>I watched this film with a friend who knew nothing of Frida, and he thought the film to be stunning and interesting.  I know a bit more about Frida than he, and whilst I found the film to be beautifully shot, very stylish and well acted, it was a very basic introduction into a very complex character, who lived her life in incredible pain (not really shown here) and whose relationship was continuously tested by many, many infidelities by both parties.  Also not dealt with, were her attempted suicides, which I think may perhaps have portrayed her as a weak person if they were simply glossed over, which she wasn't.<BR>Definitely a beautiful and impressive film, and one I would recommend.  Frida was an incredible woman, and if the film inspires you to learn more about her, then read the biography on which this film was based by Hayden Herrera (also sold on amazon).
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Tsk tsk, people. How could someone even think that by Dream Theater making this album, they are selling out? The songs are too fast and too long. Their muisicianship is superior to almost any other band out there. How could someone even set a comparison to Linkin Park or any other popular nu-metal band out there? How musically proficient is Linkin Park? How long are Linkin Park songs? I'm not dissing on Linkin Park or anything, but there is just no comparison.<br />Dream Theater is evolving and expanding their horizons, so I guess if you are a narrow-minded person or if your musical tastes don't expand past one genre of music, then I guess you wouldn't like or at least appreciate this album.<br />The guitar playing is very heavy and has that nu-metal influence, but Petrucci sounds better and faster then a lot of nu-metal bands. Plus, his solos are very fast and complex. It's just amazing and breathtaking hearing him play. How could you give this album 1 star when Petrucci is musically sound? How many guitarists can play like he does?<br />The bassist does very well with keeping up with Petrucci. Myung keeps the rhythm going and is creative in his playing when Petrucci is doing his solos and it's even fun to switch the focus from the guitar soloing to what Myung is doing on his bass. However, I wish that Myung would have fast bass solos that show off his skill, but there really isn't any. Additionally, sometimes it's hard to hear what Myung is doing when Petrucci is playing all of those heavy riffs.<br />The drums on this album aren't as complex (it's still pretty complex, though) as on previous albums, but Portnoy plays fast and with a lot of skill. It's fun to listen to his drum fills and Portnoy keeps up the rhythm very well. He also uses a lot of double-bass beats on this album, giving the album that metal flair that is reminiscent of a lot of metal bands, except with more creativity.<br />Rudess is kind of hard to hear under all of the guitars on this album a little, but he does add the extra flavor that you just don't get with a lot of bands and when you can hear him clearly, Rudess sounds very, very good. He helps add the melody that Petrucci is lacking a bit in this album and basically makes this album better as a whole.<br />And finally, LaBrie. In my opinion, his vocals get better and better with each album. In previous albums, his vocals take some getting used to since I don't really enjoy his style of vocals, but now he is the only vocalist of his style that I can actually enjoy. He does very well on this album, although sometimes he is absent for big chunks of some songs. I don't really understand how anyone could say that LaBrie sounds like he's rapping. I also listen to rap music (sorry if I offended anybody), and LaBrie IS expanding his vocal ability, but not as far as to go into rapping!<br />Overall, this is a very good and heavy album. Dream Theater are expanding as artists and fans are just going to have to accept that. Don't freak out and start having sadistic tendencies like breaking the disc or writing 8+ negative reviews just because you only like prog-rock music and can't stand heavier and different music that Dream Theater is expanding to. <br />I say bravo Dream Theater! Keep up the good work and thank you for not trying to make the same album twice. Thank you for expanding as artists and showing us that you guys know what muisicianship is, even if some of your fans will abandon you for their narrow-mindedness.

B00005NOOH|5.0|When I was young I used to wait up late until the local CBC affiliate put aired the weekly version of World at War. Although I had watched many WWII documentaries (old footage and reels of the war were something that I just could not get enough of), this clearly stood out as something different. Gone was the entire Hollywood idea of allies smashing the hapless Germans in battles where you never saw the death of the good guys. Here were bodies floating on the beaches of Tarawa, and Normandy. Here were hardbitten 8th Army Troops battling their way up the boot of Italy. Here was an assessment of what 20th Century Mechanised war entailed --- the complete extermination or subjugation of your enemy. The ability to resort to any means to persue the end of the war, however just or vile such ends may be.     It was a real shocker. Cold shower of reflection that this war WAS different. That those who rid the world of the twin enenmies of Naziism and Japanese Militarism had never served humanity better, but that in their necessity to fight ultimate evil, bloody sacrifices, and acts far from perfect, occured.      Whole one hour segments could be used for teaching aspects of the war. The one \\"Genocide\\" is particularly distressing. But it is presented with just exactly the gravity and honesty that it should be presented. Sir Lawrence Olivier appears at the beginning to solemnly announce that what we see we will find shocking, but that these events happenned in Europe and that \\"they must never happen again.\\" Such events sound interesting in light of the medieval aspects of the breakup of the former Yugoslav republic in the 90s.     Like everything else even with 26 hour-long segments you can still miss a lot. Only 3 hours in total is spent on the war with Japan + one hour on the Burma Front (which is a very good segment). But the events come fast and furious and there are a lot of events missing including the initial Japanese aggression towards China, and some aspects of the American Island hoping campaign. In addition the Campaign in New Guinea is lacking as well as an accurate appreciation of the contributions of the Commonwealth Allies (Australian efforts in the Western Desert are not prominent and the New Guinea Campaign is given a small spot; the fact that Canada did the dress reheasal for Normandy at Dieppe and then found itself with its own beach at DDay -- Juno is not mentioned). In addition there is no mention on the fighting in China.     I bought this documentary series in order that my daughter would have some sense of understanding of the 20th Century and the events that anchor that century, and our present one, in the events of those dark days. When I watch events like \\"Genocide,\\" \\"Britain Alone\\" \\"The Development of the Bomb\\" and \\"The Air War over Europe,\\" I remember the importance of humanity and the importance of stopping early those who would threaten the stability of the world order by insisting on their version of what constitutes the \\"truth.\\"     That such people and societies are the bane of humanity and need to be controlled and stopped at an early time lest they take advantage of our weakness is one of the main lessons of this greatest of WWII documentaries.
0440213525|1.0|I'm a college student studying abroad in Germany, and starved for some english reading material I picked up The Client in a bookstore here. I had never read any Grisham but there isn't much english selection in German book stores. Frankly, I was unimpressed. The story is halfway decent, but Grisham has no identifiable style to speak of. It reads like a 3rd grade essay on the pyramids. The characterization is forced and contrived. There's not one character with any depth, and even their names are ridiculous. As a study abroad student I can't help but feel ashamed that our country somehow made this book a bestseller. If you have a reading level above that of a 10 year old, pick up a John Irving novel, or even a Harry Potter book! Save yourself from the mind-numbing nothingness that is John Grisham.
B00004R99U|1.0|There's only one word to describe how I feel about this movie: HATE!!! <br />This was probably one of the first Disney sequels I ever saw, and also the worst. Even &quot;The Return of Jafar&quot; was better than this one, and that's saying alot!! I can't believe she ditched John Smith. It just dosn't make any sense. Mr. Rolphe isn't very outstanding either. Though they never show it in this movie (I don't think), there is a little bit of a historical record in it. Pocahontas DID marry John Rolfe. She went back to London with him and became a Christian. About 2 years later she died of a disease. <br />I have this sense of knowing when a movie is bad from the very beginning. After Flit smashes into that flower painting I knew this would be a bad movie; and it is!! I finally had to sell this movie to forget about it forever. Thankfully, I can now watch the first Pocahontas in peace, without worry. :) <br />So please, don't waste your money on this garbage. Buy a good, decent film instead. Like Finding Nemo....
0385510438|1.0|I have read 12 of Grisham's 17 novels.  He truly gave the best of himself at the beginning of his writing career and has been on a downhill slide ever since.  He used to write books that I literally could not put down.  I had to force myself to finish this book.  It had none of the page-turning, pulse-pounding suspense of his earlier books.  It was just...boring.  On top of that I found it to be sloppy, too.  There were times when he told us (again) what he had just told us 2 pages earlier.  Whoever edited this book also missed several mistakes (Miss Callie would have counted!)<br />Want good Grisham?  Go back and just reread his older stuff because he's obviously not going to give us anything new that comes anywhere near his earlier books.  If you're dead set of reading this, check it out from the library.  Don't waste money on it.
B000001EL7|5.0|This is a great Kiss album.  But this is NOT the last album with the original members.  They had at least two more albums with the original members (Unmasked and Dynasty have the original members).  I hate to see wrong information about this band.  They are also not from Detroit as I've read in some magazines.  <BR>  But enough of this.  Love Gun is a great 70's album.  A classic.  Even the few weak songs as listenable. The best song is &quot;Shock Me&quot; because it was Ace's first shot as a singer with this band. &quot;I Stole Your Love&quot; has great guitar.  &quot;Love Gun&quot; is a killer Kiss song.  &quot;Almost Human&quot; is a great Gene Simmons song. I could go on and on.  If you enjoy Kiss and you don't have this album - GET IT!!!
B0000VCZK2|4.0|OK let me start off by saying these movies are awesome. I would of given it a five but Alien Resurrection was what stopped me.(read on I'll explain).    Alien (1979)         This movie was very good. It had the horror, the suspense, and the question \\"what next\\".The scene with the chestburster was pure originality. It is about a ship with 8 crew members who are in hyper sleep and on their way home. They are then woken up by a distress call and go to a foreign planet to check it out. Little did they know this was a warning not a distress call.    I give it a 9/10.    Aliens (1986)          Even though the first was great this was much better. It has way more action, much more suspense, AND MOST IMPORTANT MORE ALIENS (INCLUDING THE QUEEN).In this movie Ripley is picked up by a spaceship where later she finds she's been asleep for 57 years. She then accompanies a military group to go to the alien planet to kill them all. Little does she know this is probably the biggest adventure she has ever faced.             I give this a 10/10 (best of the series)    Alien 3 (1992)           This is definitely the darkest of the series. I find it to be pretty good. It's a little slow at the beginning but it gets fast paced later on. In this one Ripley's ship crashes on a prison planet. She later finds out that the crash was caused by an alien who got on bored. She finds that all 25 men on the planet are all rapest and very religious and must be very careful around them. Nobody believes her about the alien that is on the planet and they find it to be true when they get picked off one by one. Then Ripley finds out that the Queen alien is IMPLANTED in side of her and will die. She is determined to kill the alien and then herself to save mankind.          This movie is decent and gets an 8/10.    Alien Ressurection (1997)                      This movie was a disappointment to me. I hated the way Ripley was so close to the aliens especially at the end when she cry's as her \\"child\\"(the alien)gets sucked out of the ship. In the Fourth installment of the Quadrilogy Ripley is cloned(since she dies in the 3rd one) so scientist can get the alien out of her to breed and study. While she looks the same she has quality's like an alien(acid blood,temper,super strength). She then says she is the mother of the aliens. The aliens get loose and she must try to stop them with the help of the crew members.           I find this the worst of the series and it's lucky to even get the score I'm giving it 6/10.    If Resurrection was better i would of given the set 5 stars. See for yourself.
B00009W0U4|4.0|I can't deny that Irreversible is an interesting,intriguing film. It is definately original, and well put together.It also happens to include a scene of brutal violence,involving a man's head beaten down to the bones with a fire extinguisher, and an absolutely heart wrenching rape scene that lasts for something of 10 minutes, involving the gorgeous Monica Bellucci.<br />I feel that the ULTRA violence is crucial to the way the film works, because, since the movie runs in reverse sequence,a la Memento, you start out with the bloody violent end, and \\"end\\" with the clean,pure,and happy beginning. That is one of the top reasons I praise this film; its ability to take you from a place so dark and sinister you couldn't even imagine, into a peacful world without blinking once, and losing its intensity.Also,I want to add that I can understand how some would be turned off by the heavy content of the rape scene, but don't go calling it gratituous,or revolting. Rape is a SERIOUS,SERIOUS  crime, and I'm sick of it being glossed over in the movies.If you find it revolting,then don't pick a movie that deals with the subject.Seriously, people, it's time that rape was handled honestly in a film.Safe to say, this film achieves that to the max.<br />Director Gaspar Noe masterfully creates a dark,creepy,sinister atmosphere through the use of lighting,soundtrack and nauseating camera shifts.The actors also seem very natural in their roles-it really doesn't feel like they're acting at all, which is the case with many European films of quality.Monica Bellucci is lovely and full of inexplicable,irresistible charm.Towards the end of the film, where you get to know these people prior to the horrific events that took place, you see a vivid portrait of a young couple.Vincent Cassel, who is Bellucci's real life husband, worked well alongside Monica as her boyfriend in the film.The film created a compelling,tender portrait of their relationship, making it all the more heart wrenching to think ofthe way things turned out.The film's reverse order workes perfectly, and I believe the film would not have achieved it's effect without this technique.<br />All in all, I'll say that the latter,toned down parts towards the film's end do not pale at all in comparison to the film's brutal beginning.They're just different, putting it mildly.Another interesting prospect the film brings up through a series of hints, and silent gestures, is that perhaps all this horror was just imagined inside the female protagonist's head.Pretty to think so, ain't it?<br />Irreversible is not for the squeamish, but if you're up for an interesting,altogether different film, see it once.I'm not going to call it a work of art, or claim it as life-changing.What it is, however, is a worthy, albeit challenging film that will leave you truly immersed in thought.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|Through the first listen, this album reminded me of the Romantics. When I thought the album was going to run out of steam, it surprised me with something new. These guys are talented, whether they know it or not. I would definitely suggest \\"This Fire\\" as well as the last track, \\"40'\\". Boy, is this song good. I'm not sure if these guys are on anything but an honest kick, but it's definitely a kick in the ass. There are some interesting innuendos, as well as some unique vocal/word and rhythm play. The lyrics are purely poetic. If you dig this, try the Libertines \\"Up The Bracket\\" or Air's new release, \\"Talkie Walkie.\\"
B000002P5W|5.0|Axis and Electric Lady Land are my two all time favorite Hendrix albums. With songs like Little Wing, If 6 was 9, and Castles Made Of Sand, this is a landmark album. Hendrix was light years ahead of his time. Get this cd, along with Electric Lady Land, and just let it all soak in. Axis is a piece of artwork from a master musician who left this world before his time, and left a void that can never be filled again....
B0001OGVQ2|5.0|Wrestlemania XX- where it all begins.... again, was a great event and a tremendous Wrestlemania. The best matches were Christian vs. Chris Jericho. It was a superb match with a great ending and a great aftermath. Trish turned on Jericho! The following match was a heck of a lot better than I expected it to be. Evolution took on the Rock'N'Sock Connection in a great match.It had a great ending that came out of nowhere. Brock Lesnar vs. Goldeberg was bad, but the crowd was unbelievable. They caught onto the rumors and their chants showed it. I hope the WWE doesn' edit them out of the tape. It was like Rock vs. Hogan, but completely opposite!The next great match was Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero. It was very great with another great ending!The last match of the night was also the best. HHH vs. HBK vs. Benoit. Benoit's night was here and his era begins!
B00009W0U4|3.0|It's hard to watch because it's hard to take ANY of the main characters seriously, because they're all classic French drama queens!  Every second, every one of them is practically bursting with comically exaggerated emotions (unintentionally comic, that is), foaming at the mouth, convulsed by kaleidoscopic and manic flashes of existential angst/despair/desire/frustration/rage/etc.  It's like watching a bunch of moths on PCP bouncing off the insides of a Mason jar.  Ah, the passion, the passion...<br />(So THIS is what the Buddhists call &quot;the comedy of the ego.&quot;)<br />The film is kind of like a film version of Martin Amis' book, &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; which tells a story backwards.  Interesting gimmick/concept, but results in a barely watchable film, especially given the erratic and deliberately artsy-fartsy camera work (practically nauseating during the beginning of the film).
B000060P79|5.0|i have been a punk fan for the vast majority of my 19 years.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERY1 FUSSES ABOUT A BAND NOT BEING \\"REAL PUNK\\".  <br />If you think about it, who really cares? Simple Plan is not claiming they are the most angst-ridden hardcore punk band in a generatrion.  <br />What they DO CLAIM is that they make enjoyable, upbeat rock/pop music for the masses.  If you like this music for the masses, listen up, if you don't, please don't slam it for something it doesn't even claim.<br />I love listening to this band and I love listening to my hardly known underground punk bands....It's all the same, if a band has a message...which most don't...then listen to the message and decide if you want them.  If a band is only there to get you to dance and smile....BY ALL MEANS, DANCE AND SMILE!!!!!
0974153001|5.0|This is the book I have been looking for. Sculptors of figurative sculptures (dolls) will find this book very helpful no matter what their experience level is. Anatomy is handled in a very simple yet precise way. Great book. I love it.
B00009V7T2|4.0|This is an excellent album, intellegent song writing, odd meter, and time changes out the ying yang, and highly creative.  Yet, many reviewers have gone a touch over board.  This is not the most creative music on the planet... in fact its far from it.  I would certainly recomend buying this album to anyone that has a newly developed interest in challenging music but these guys don't come anywhere close to bands like Mr. Bungle, Fantomas, Melt Bananna, or Estradasphere when it comes to creativity and talent.  They aren't even in the same league.
B00005MAM2|1.0|The original movie &quot;Akira&quot; that came out in the 80's is, in my opinion the greatest animated film ever created. It has so many things going for it. The animation is fantastic, along with great music and sound effects including a unique, gripping, action packed story line.<br />My friend lost my tape of the original movie a couple of years ago, and when I saw the &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD version of the movie, I was excited to say the least. I got home and watched the movie as soon as I could, and after the first 30 minutes, not only was I extremely disappointed, but I was upset. Whoever decided to re-dub this movie and change the sound is a complete idiot. The movie has lost all of the lines and sound effects that made the original tape so great. If you bought this movie originally on VHS more than 10 years ago, do not buy this version. You will be sorely disappointed, wishing you had the old version on VHS to watch.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|I ordered this match on PPV and I enjoyed it from top to bottom.<br />1)Big Show vs John Cena   U.S Title<BR> good opener, Cena never gave up,it tooke 2 FU's and brass knuckles to do it  9/10<br />2) RVD/BookerT vs La Ressistance vs Dudleys vs Cade/Jindrak<BR>  I enjoyed this match, RVD was in great shape 8/10<br />3) Y2J vs Christian<BR> great skillful match up, but dissapointing ending 9.5/10<br />4) Rock N Sock Connection vs Evolution<BR> entertaining and enjoyable 9/10<br />5) Torrie/Sable vs Stacy/Jackie  Playboy Evening Gown match<BR>  loved it, because all these women looked hot, and the match was not that bad 7/10<br />6)Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar<BR> dissapointing match, the match was boring, they didnt do much,the boring chants came out, the only thing good bout this match was when Austin stunned both men. 5/10<br />7) Cruiserweight Open<BR> all bodies flying and unbelievable moves, WOW!! what a match 10/10<br />8)Rikishi/Scotty vs SPWGTT vs APA vs Basums  WWE Tag Team Titles<BR> not bad 7.5/10<br />9) Molly vs Victoria   Womens Title<BR>  match up u will see on Raw but a great stipulation, Ill give it 8.5 because Molly got her head shaved.<br />10) Kurt Angle vs Eddie   WWE Title<BR>  Eddie does it again, great performances by these 2 men, but Eddie does it again 10/10<br />11)Undertaker vs Kane<BR> Undertaker won like that, the match was short and excellent 10/10<br />12) HHH vs HBK vs Chris Benoit<BR>  the best match of the night, crowd was really into it, blood was in it, Benoit got thrown threw the annouce table and didnt give up.WOW what a match, the best Triple Threat match ever, 11/10
B00007LTIA|5.0|Though not my favorite Yes recording (mostly because Bill Bruford doesn't play on it) there is some great music in Tales. And this new re-mastering is simply - masterful! Some re-masters I've bought have ended up sounding pretty much the same as the regular one. Not so with Tales. Great job Rhino Records!
B00003CXA2|2.0|After reading the book, I wonder how they came up with this movie. Forrest Gump went to outer space and crash landed back on Earth on a deserted island. He got pulled into the space program for throwing his Medal of Honor at the capital and hitting a Senator in the head with it. Anyone who can sit and watch Tom Hanks act like this retard for more than 15 minutes at a time has got to be in a coma.
B000002KIE|5.0|Okay.  I'm not a punk fan...at all.  But I do love rock-n-roll and this album rocks!  This is pure rock-n-roll energy!  The songs stick in your head.  God Save The Queen, Anarchy In The UK, and Holiday In The Sun are three of the greatest, rockingest songs ever!  <br />It's different and it takes a little while to get used to the accent (me being from the USA).  But, if I had to have only one rock album to keep forever, this would definitely be high on the list.<br />There is no group that can compare to the Sex Pistols...maybe that's a good thing considering everything.  For a short time, they were possibly the greatest band going, especially when you consider the late 70's and all the disco \\"music\\" being produced.  When you listen to the USA's hot group of the time - the BeeGees, and then listen to this \\"in your face\\" group, you can understand the diffence between \\"pop\\" and rock-n-roll.
B000002J1S|5.0|Man, talk about a stunning album. this is one of those very unique albums from the 70's, probably in my top five of all time. You have to give this record time though, as many other reviewers state. If you really want to know what the peter gabriel era of Genesis was all about, this one and Selling England By The Pound are the ones to get (start with selling england). They are the best albums by the band.
B000060MMI|5.0|I have to admit that I was absolutely blown away by this CD. I didn't realize that there were bands like this around and happened upon them by accident. I am a Dropkick Murphy's fan, but Flogging Molly gave me what I was looking for in the way of the Irish/Punk mix. Every song is sung with passion and guts. Slow or fast, every song on this CD is great. Flogging Molly blend a nice Irish folk feel with an aggressive punk feel to make some pretty catchy unique music. I tested this one out on my brother, who is not into the punk scene whatsoever, but loves Irish folk (as I do,but I love punk as well), and he agreed that it was great Irish music. Whether you are into the Clancy Brothers, Irish Rovers, etc...or Rancid, Exploited, etc... this CD is sure to satisfy your tastes. I recommend this one highly!
0385512104|5.0|There is a reality to &quot;The Curious Incident of Dog in Night-Time.&quot; It is a pseudo-mystery from the prospective of a semi-autistic child. The plot is brilliant but so perfectly set to fall victim to over sentimentalizing or unintentional humor. Yet Mark Haddon brilliantly avoids those pitfalls with the same panache that Rikki Lee Travolta's &quot;My Fractured Life&quot; and Sue Monk Kidd's &quot;Secret Life of Bees&quot; avoid being parodies of their own worlds. Somehow Haddon creates a real world with his words and maintains it faithfully to rival &quot;My Fractured Life&quot; and &quot;Secret Life of Bees&quot; both. A stellar book.
B00005JN1L|5.0|I loved this movie. It had a little bit of everything: comedy, suspence, horror, and whatever makes a movie good. The only way this movie could have been predictable was if you read the frieken book. I really would recommed everyone to see this movie. I hate going to the movies because of the price, but I would actually pay to see this one again, in fact I think I will go see it again......right now.
B00009V7P8|5.0|For those that enjoy the soulfulness of Jack Johnson but wanted something with a little more bite--a little more heartbreak and emotion--pick up Damien Rice's debut CD.  This Irish artist has one of the most fantastic voices and his singing makes your skin crawl.  <br />Take for example the first song, Delicate.  Rice's voice escalates into an emotional rocking--the lyrics pumping throughout your body.  You cannot help but be moved by each song.  <br />Indeed, there isn't a bad song on the album which makes purchasing the whole CD worthwhile.
078322608X|3.0|This is a really great movie. But, there is a but. I did not like the plot, where someone from the future goes back to the past - and the future results in something because the future is somehow involved in the past. That makes no sense, and there was some other logical breaks. But a really great movie after all, exiting, intelligent, good actors and all that. The 7.9 in imdb is deserved - and I recomend it, if you like sci-fi back in time movies - because it is typical that way.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue is arguable the sexiest singing star in the world, she looks the part, pics the right songs and oozes sexy all the time. Maybe I'm blinded, but she sounds great all the time. My guilty pleasure, but good nonetheless.
0060925000|5.0|While I found &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; hard work to get into, after a few chapters I was completely involved. At first, the huge array of characters is overwhelming, but each one is so individual and colourful that they all become unforgettable. I found myself not wanting the story to end, as I had become so attached to every character. Can't wait to read it again with a different outlook!
B00005RHGK|5.0|Trish (Gina Phillips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are on their way home from school in Trish's old car. On a long, lonely stretch of highway, they encounter a maniac driving a souped up truck that's as fast as a rocket-sled! Said maniac keeps crashing into the rear of their car and zooms off around them and into the distance. While still recovering from this experience, Trish and Darry see this guy, loading what appear to be bodies, down a pipe by an old abandoned church. Of course, they simply MUST investigate or there wouldn't be much of a movie now would there? So, when the big guy leaves, they go to the pipe, and Darry  crawls into it! In the darkness below, he discovers a subterranean nightmare of death! This is no ordinary stalker / slasher story after all. Darry, now in shock, staggers up and out through the church and Trish drives them to a diner to call the police. It just gets creepier from there. The cops arrive, adding a sense of false security. Things are about to spin wildly out of control for everyone concerned, once The Creeper makes \\"his\\" intentions known. The Creeper is one of the better movie monsters I've seen in years. He'll definitely stick in your head! JEEPERS CREEPERS is a grand combination of familiar horror / thriller elements. The beginning is a lot like Spielberg's \\"Duel\\" in it's relentless chase between car and truck. The unveiling of the creeper's cathedral of death reminded me of the discovery of the queen's egg-chamber in \\"Aliens\\" or the living-room scene in the original \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", shocking and disturbing. Also, there's a scene at the police station that reminded me of Arnold's infamous \\"I'll be Back!\\" sequence in \\"The Terminator\\". JEEPERS CREEPERS is one of the best horror movies I've seen in quite a while. Great acting, eerie situations, a scary monster, and a continual sense of dread should be enough for any fan of the genre...inator\\". I don't consider these ripoffs. I call them tributes. JEEPERS CREEPERS is one of the best horror movies I've seen in years. It's certainly better than most of the lame \\"Scream\\"-ish clones floating around. Great acting, eerie situations, a scary monster, and a continual sense of dread should be enough for any fan of this type of spook-fest...
B00005JLK1|3.0|I am a horror/thriller movie lover, so this movie did not really scare me too much, but for those who can't quite handle too much scare, this is for you.  The plot is basic and there is a little twist in it, most of all I just enjoyed the actors, they all had great character definition, which is nice in a thriller.  There are no ditzy characters that walk into the scene when they shouldn't. Their actions are more realistic. Especially Karl Urban, whom I like very much.  It is fast-paced and thery get to the point pretty quickly, real nice EFX, if you are into that.  <BR>Overall a fun movie to watch.
0679720200|5.0|The last time I read this book was in undergraduate school--too young at age 17 (I was a univeristy student of English Literature.). At the time, it made very little sense to me; I simply did not have the necessary life experience to appreciate it. I think I understood, on some level, that Nothing/Death/Emptiness/the possibility of Fate was the basic gist of it all, but now I see a whole lot more here. <BR>Now I think that Albert Camus' THE STRANGER is a book more about anonymity, destiny and the absurdity of human life. (Scary)<br />Now I do understand. (I think.) I fancy myself an Existentialist, but this is difficult reading despite the straight-forward langage, plot and character-development.<br />I do recommend this book, but probably to people in atleast their late teens--someone who is not afraid to think about the nothingness that may lie beyond death.<br />I will not be reading this book again. It reminds me too much THE UNDERGROUND MAN (DISTURBING AND ALL ALONE!)
B00002782L|5.0|It has been thirty years since &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; was released and of all of the albums recorded by Bob Dylan it is the one that has most increased in stature simply because every album produced since then has failed to rise to this level. I think the reason for this is mainly because it was born in a creative burst of pointed lyricisim as his marriage to Sara Lowndes collapsed, with all the songs written in two months in the middle of 1974. I would no more expect any personal turmoil to provide similar inspiration any more than I would have expected any of the songs on this album to rise to the level of social rhetoric found in his greatest songs of the Sixties.<br />In &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; Dylan also turned his back on his greatest backing band, returning to his artistic routes on an album that is largely acoustic-based. The songs run the emotional gamut from sorrow and regret to bitterness and pain. At the same time, despite the obvious point of origin for most of these songs, this is not an openly confessional album (cf. Courtney Love's &quot;America's Sweetheart&quot;). After all, we are talking the lyrics of Bob Dylan, which means cryptic riddles and allegories abound all laid out in ten classic tracks:<br />&quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; is the best song on the album and the ambguity about the characters and relationships Dylan sings about has only increased over the years with the shifting lyrics in various performances. The cover version by the Indigo Girls remains my favorite Dylan cover.<br />&quot;Simple Twist of Fate&quot; is another great four-word phrase in a song that represents the most overtly personal song on the album. The stark instrumentation only serves to highlight the heartbreak of the existentialist lyrics and the mournful sound of the vocals.<br />&quot;You're A Big Girl Now&quot; is a ballad on the end of a relationship and a sort of benediction in that clearly the woman is right to move on, but Dylan is still haunted by their physical encounters. You would think that this would have been the logical final track for the album, but it is not.<br />&quot;Idiot Wind&quot; is song on the album that most reminds me of an earlier Dylan composition, namely &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; the pair being a set of put-down songs. The difference is that while both song lash out in lots of directions, this one keeps coming back to a certain &quot;babe.&quot; This is another song that has changed over the year for various reasons that could well inspire a doctoral dissertation.<br />&quot;You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go&quot; is a rather upbeat track, despite the descending chord progressions, and is usually considered a song hopeful of reconciliation rather than one eulogizing the breakup.<br />&quot;Meet Me in the Morning&quot; stands out musically as the most blues oriented track that always struck me as cleansing the palatte for what was coming next on the album.<br />&quot;Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts&quot; is a 8:50 story song that basically wears down the listener's insistence that this is a biographical album. It also has a line that Dylan seems to sing with nic epitch and without affection, to wit, &quot;and Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.&quot; Pay attention next time through to that one phrase.<br />&quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot; probably represents the emotional low point of the album, with lyrics reflecting a singer who is crushed and embittered by the end of the relationship, turning his anger in on himself.<br />&quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot; is a song of simple beauty, based on three chords and a simple melody, underscoring a profound sense of loss. The song provides an avalanche of symbols and metaphors, but actually seems to end on an optimstic note.<br />&quot;Buckets of Rain&quot; provides a fitting finale, suitably depressing lyrics against a rather upbeat melody as irony once again abounds. After this song thereis no where left to go.<br />&quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; is listed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as the #16 record on the list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, between #15 &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and #17 &quot;Nevermind&quot; by Nirvana.

B00014K5TQ|4.0|THERE ARE MANY THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THIS MOVIE AND SEVERAL THINGS I DON'T LIKE. FIRST OFF, THE ACTING (BY BOTH SETH GREEN AND MACK CULKIN) WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS. THEY LOOKED GREAT, JUST LIKE THE CHARACTERS THEY PORTRAYED (AS SEEN IN THE FILM \\"PARTY MONSTER: THE SHOCKUMENTARY\\"), BUT THEY JUST COULDN'T PULL OFF THAT ELUSIVE \\"SOMETHING\\" THAT MADE THE CLUB KIDS INTO \\"STARS.\\" THE ACTORS WERE STIFF AND AWKWARD. EVEN MARILYN MANSON'S ACTING, WHO MADE A SOMEWHAT LONG CAMEO APPEARANCE AS CHRISTINA, A DRUG-ADDLED DRAG QUEEN, WAS BETTER THAN THE MAIN CHARACTERS'.<br />CULKIN, AS MICHAEL ALIG, THE SELF-CONFESSED MURDERER OF HIS DRUG DEALER, ANGEL, WAS FUN TO WATCH--HIS COSTUMES, HIS GORY PARTIES, HIS STRANGE, SEEMINGLY BISEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH HIS \\"FRIENDS\\"..... BUT IN THE END, AFTER HE COMMITS THE MURDER, APPARENTLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MIND-ALTERING DRUGS, HE IS JUST PLAIN SCARY.<br />THERE ARE SOME PRETTY GORY SCENES IN THE FILM, PARTICULARLY THE MURDER ITSELF, WITH MICHAEL'S ROOMMATE BASHING ANGEL'S HEAD IN WITH A HAMMER SEVERAL TIMES. AND THEN, FOR A HANDFUL OF DRUGS, MICHAEL ALIG AGREES TO CUT THE BODY UP INTO LITTLE PIECES AND DISPOSE OF IT. IT WAS REALLY VERY GROSS AND DISTURBING TO WATCH AND TO THINK ABOUT AFTERWARDS. FORTUNATELY, THEY KEPT THE DISMEMBERMENT MINIMAL.<br />OVERALL, I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS MOVIE. FOR SOME REASON, IT IS FRIGHTENINGLY FUN TO WATCH BEAUTIFUL, \\"FABULOUS,\\" DRUG ADDICTS/DRAG QUEENS COMMIT MURDERS AND THEN JOKE ABOUT IT. (AND THEN THEY TURN AROUND AND MAKE MONEY OFF THE MOVIE, THE DOCUMENTARY AND THE BOOKS.)

0425098478|4.0|&quot;The One Minute Manger&quot; by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson teaches the readers the three skills to achieving effective management.  Although the keys to being an effective and successful manager, as described by Blanchard and Johnson, seems unbelievably simple, they will strike an understanding chord among most people who have ever managed and supervised employees.  Not because managers typically follow the principles, but precisely because these simple principles are ones that they intuitively know they should be practicing yet do not because of lack of conviction in the methods, worry about changing management styles, low level of interest, or apprehension that they will take too much time.<br />Not to fear, Blanchard and Johnson address these concerns in their short simple book.  The allegory starts off with a young man in search of an effective manager.  Initially disillusioned by the managers he encounters, who are only results-oriented at the expense of the employees or only people-oriented at the expense of the organization, the young man discovers The One Minute Manager.  The young man learns from The One Minute Manager and the people whom he manages the philosophy of the one-minute management style.  The authors gradually convince the readers through examples, anecdotes, explanations, and quotable quotes why and how their three principles, when followed appropriately, actually work. A brief guideline list accompanies each of the three management skills:  the \\"one minute goal setting,\\" \\"one minute praising,\\" and \\"one minute reprimand.\\"  There is even a concise flow chart to help solidify the management principles into one page near the end of the book; no doubt, designed to be cut-out or photocopied and posted in every manager's office. By the end of the short 60 minutes required to finish the book, most readers will be convinced to at least test out the method. After all, the title of the book already suggests that time commitment is not anissue; one can become an effective manager by investing a short 60-second of time.  When one reads the book, this really translates to several 60-second intervals per day, but the amount of time will be much less than what most managers are used to.<br />More effective management in significantly less time?  Is it possible?  The authors certainly make a compelling yet uncomplicated and clear case for this. One does have to wonder if this is too easy.  Will it work for managing all types of people in all types of organizations?  How about the slackers? Or the employee who is the wrong fit for the job, doesn't have the appropriate training, or lacks motivation? How about the company with a long tradition of top-down management style?  The book doesn't get mired in the details or specifics of every possible variation or situation; instead it attempts to provide the general strategies of effective management.  The simple message of the book is to focus on making people feel valued which will lead to greater self-motivation and increased productivity for the individual and organization. As the One Minute Manager best described it, \\"People who feel good about themselves produce good results.\\"  And because they are not difficult to understand, learn, or implement, the skills can be readily used by most managers immediately.<br />The book is not only for managers of people.  The message from the book is relevant to anybody interacting with people or when managing your own work and life.  For example, I can utilize the skills to not only manage the people who report to me, but also in working with my colleagues or my supervisor, although the lesson on reprimanding may be less applicable in such situations.  The most useful setting to apply the skills, perhaps, is when teamwork is involved, such as in committees, meetings, and group projects.  This is when setting goals and timelines are critical and working effectively with colleagues, including giving praise and constructive criticism, is paramount to success.  Furthermore, I can even see me being a One Minute Manager to myself, be it in the work environment, personal life, educational pursuits, or participation in hobbies.  Who wouldn't want to be happier and have better results in all of these activities?  I wouldn't mind impressing my boss more, fulfilling all my New Year's resolutions, or running a marathon in 3 hours and 15 minutes.  After reading &quot;The One Minute Manger&quot;, most readers will want to be a One Minute Manager tomorrow.

B00007KWHP|5.0|FRAGILE was first issued in January of 1972. Thirty-plus years later, the album still resonates across the popular music landscape.  It was the group's highest-charting album in the U.S. (peaking at No. 4) and yielded its highest-charting single at the time with the classic \\"Roundabout\\" (No. 13).<br /><br />The lineup of the band was still undergoing change. They lost founding member Tony Kaye and brought in Former Strawbs' keyboardist Rick Wakeman.  [Another founding member Bill Bruford would leave (to join King Crimson) after completing the follow-up CLOSE TO THE EDGE.] Each member contributed to the success of FRAGILE.  Wakeman's tour de force is \\"Cans and Brahms\\" (an extract from Brahm's 4th Symphony), which  has him playing electric piano, grand piano, organ and synthesizer to take the parts of the original orchestral parts.<br /><br />\\"We Have Heaven\\" has Jon Anderson performing all the vocal parts. \\"Five Percent of Nothing\\" (at a brief 35 seconds) is Bruford's percussion showcase. Chris Squire's bass work is featured prominently on his \\"The Fish.\\" In the same vein as the previous album's \\"Clap,\\" Chris Squire shows his acoustic guitar prowess on the delicate \\"Mood for a Day.\\"<br /><br />The bonus tracks are a nice addition.  You get the full ten-and-a-half minute version of Paul Simon's \\"America\\" (the single version only went to No. 46), along with a previously unreleased early rough mix of \\"Roundabout,\\" which is not substantially different from the final version.<br /><br />Eventually \\"progessive rock\\"  became a dirty word in the music world, but in the early days of the Seventies, Yes were one of the most innovative bands of the era and this is their masterpiece. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

B00005JM20|4.0|This film reminds me a little of Pink Panther, a little of Don Knotts, and lots of Bean.  It's silly humor at the highest.  There are jokes for all, though some won't like them all.  A few of the jokes were in the gutter which will offend the easily offended.  But Bond (the series this parodies) would offend those people as well, so I doubt they're going to be seeking out Johnny English.  The DVD is fine.  It looks great, sounds great, and has a few nice extras.  I always like deleted scenes, but this would have been a perfect film to have a blooper real.  All in all...well worth the $.  Especially considering it makes for a wonderful party film, no one saw it at the theater, it's really funny, and you could make a drinking game.  Start with a drink every time English falls down or every time Malkovich says &quot;English&quot; with his silly accent.

B00000DQSV|3.0|I dont usually write reviews online, but I am so perplexed by some of the reviews for Duran Durans Notorious that I feel that, as a long time fan, I need to put in my two cents.  I really wonder exactly what some of these one star reviews are about.  The fact that Duran Duran lost popularity in the mid-80s?  The idea that Uriah Heep might be a better band?  The fact that somebodys kid started liking classic rock around the time this album came out?  Apparently, Duran Duran suffers from the same problem it always did:  people who never liked them still have too much time on their hands, and so they spend it criticizing music they didnt listen to in the first place.  This is as ridiculous as me criticizing, say, Bon Jovi.  I loathe every song of theirs that I have ever heard, so why would I waste my time talking about their music, their career, their musical ability, or telling everybody about how their records started to fail on the charts in the early 90s?  Ill leave that to Bon Jovis fans and turn the channel every time Livin On a Prayer comes on, just others should leave Duran Duran to its fans and do the same when they hear Save a Prayer.  Its only fair.<br />That said, Notorious is NOT Durans best album, but I loved it when it came out and there are enough good moments (Skin Trade, Winter Marches On, Notorious, American Science, Vertigo) to make it well worth repeated listening for any fan, new or old.  Just keep in mind that it was an album made during a time of transition, and it probably pleases fans that were in for the long haul the most.  Even Nick Rhodes said at the time that fans expecting another Rio would be disappointed.  They never wanted to make a sequel to that album.<br />So the bottom line is:  if you are a fan, Notorious is worth your while.  It is a musically solid album with both hits and misses.  Dont listen to people who want to review the 80s, chart positions, or their kids musical tastes!  Listen to Notorious and decide for yourself.
B000089RVX|5.0|even though evanescence means 'to dissapear' i dont think they'll be doing that ne time soon!Amy Lee can really sing and their band is truly rock!the songs are a little depressing and a little creepy but hey i like that kinda music.Even though she disses Britney Spears (who i kinda like)i still think shes awesome!Evanescence needs to make more albums!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I am very happy with this new release from one of my favorite musicians of recent years. This album holds special meaning in my life right now after my great-uncle passed away at age 88 last December. <br /> This album is very sad yet happy in mood and deals with the concept of death and life and amidst it all, hope! You could almost say that this album is similar in tone to Peter Gabriel's &quot;Up&quot; from 2002. <br /> &quot;Train Wreck&quot; is my favorite song which captures the energy of her earlier songs and is one my favorite songs by her. &quot;Dirty Little Secret&quot; is another favorite of mines off this album. <br /> The rest are really good as well. <br /> Sarah McLachlan, thank you very much for this record. This CD means a lot to me right now after the loss I endured recetly. I will treasure &quot;Afterglow&quot; forever.
0385510438|5.0|In 1970 a woman gets brutally raped and murdered.  He is sentenced to life in prison instead of the death penalty.  At the end of his trial he threatens the jury that he will get them back.   One year later there is a massive shooting in the Ford County.  Everyone thinks that it is one of the Padgitts but is it.  After four years in prison he is seen in another city with a parole officer.  Why is he let out of prison after only four years? <BR>This book is set in Mississippi.  <BR>It is like a lot of other John Grisham books but it doesn't have a lot of Lawyers in it.  John Grisham makes this sound like a real life story that could happen at any time.  He keeps the suspense going throughout the whole book with something different in each chapter.   <BR> Every book of John Grisham's that I have read I just can't stop reading it and this book does not change that either.  I hope John Grisham keeps writing and makes the books better and better.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This album really doesn't do the trick man! Foul, disgusting, and really devoid of substance, &quot;In THe Zone&quot; continues the stream of dreck that we've been subjected to for the last five years! Don't buy this. If you agree, vote yes, if not, vote no.
B000001FGG|5.0|If you play, or have ever wanted to play, improvisational rock and roll, you must have this album. From a musical standpoint, this ranks as among the handful of most influential rock records ever made. Even now, more than 35 years after its making, it is a breathtaking tour de force of musical power and creativity.<br />I can't think of any live rock recording that comes close to matching the quality of simultaneous improvisation captured on disc 2 of Wheels of Fire. Many people think of Cream as Eric Clapton's band, but disc 2 proves it was a trio of three equally superb musicians. The 16-minute long \\"Spoonful\\" jam features a brilliant interplay of guitar (Clapton), drums (Ginger Baker), and bass (Jack Bruce) that builds to climax after climax.<br />It's hard to communicate now how revolutionary Eric Clapton's guitar work was in the late 1960s. All I can say is, his live solos on \\"Spoonful\\" and \\"Crossroads\\" inspired and challenged a generation of rock guitarists. Other guitarists may be faster than Clapton, but no one could match his ability to build melodic climaxes one after another.<br />Disc 1 consists of nine studio recordings that don't measure up to the intensity of the live performances on disc 2, but there are several excellent cuts. \\"White Room\\" is probably the most popular cut, but there are several good blues rock numbers--my favorite is \\"Politician\\"--featuring strong vocals by Jack Bruce as well as piercing guitar work by Clapton. Overall, if you are a fan of Cream or of blues rock in general, this is an essential CD of historical as well as musical significance.
B0001AP12G|5.0|DAMN MAN!! This debut is hottt!!! Sorry it took me so long to write my review, even though I got this CD 2 days after it came out!! 2 weeks ago, I planned and planned to do this review, but I became too lazy. <br />    There are some good rap producers out there, but they don't have the experience and intelligence that the 3-year Roc-A-Fella producer, Kanye West, had in this debut!!<BR>    <BR>    In his debut, he has some hot beats! I'm tellin ya. Some of the rappers that are featured on the College Dropout are Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Ludacris, GFC, and his good friend, Mos Def, and they made this album even hotter!!! You can tell he put some good effort into this CD.<br />    Unfortunately, the first sign of him about to make the College Dropout was when he made his first video, \\"Through The Wire,\\" which was made when he had his mouth wired shut for like 6 weeks due to the fact that he got into a car accident in October 2002. I can't believe the hits that are on this CD. It's hard for me to choose a favorite song on the CD. Well, some favorites on the CD are \\"All Falls Down,\\" \\"Jesus Walks,\\" \\"Never Let Me Down,\\" \\"Spaceship,\\" \\"Slow Jamz,\\" and of course \\"Through The Wire.\\" I recommend you listen to those hits!!<br />     There are some skits in here that will make you laugh because Cedric The Entertainer is on here. <br />     Another recommended song to listen to on there is to the long song, \\"Last Call,\\" and that's a hit that you can learn about Kanye West on because he has an interview on there while the hot beat is still going!<br />     Well, compare Pharell to Kanye West, I think that Kanye West is better, even though Pharell is a good producer. <BR>  <BR>     Put it this way, this CD will not be a waste of money if you go out and by it! Therefore, this is definately recommended for the streetz!!!
B00006JIA4|5.0|Before I got this box set I didn't really know who Queen was except for We Are The Champions, We Will Rock You, and Bohemian Rhapsody. After listening to these CDs, I have to say it's the best music I have ever bought. I like every song on the first and second CDs, and on the third, except the insulting rap of Another One Bites The Dust, they are great, especially Princes Of The Universe. I would give this CD a 30 out of 5 stars if I could.
B00000JRTX|1.0|What a hideous movie! I was furious when it was done because I had just wasted two hours watching a movie that has nothing to recommend it. This movie is neither funny nor inspiring.<br />It was interesting in the beginning. Will the two main characters get together? My sympathy for Andie McDowell's character slipped when she had sex with Hugh Grant while engaged to someone else, and disappeared altogether when she recalled one by one her many lovers (32 of 'em).  It's impossible for me to believe that she would remain faithful while married.<br />Hugh Grant's character was not much better. When he couldn't have Andie, he asked someone else, someone who was absolutely crazy about him.  Too bad the plot required that she be left at the altar.<br />The only characters I liked were the two gay guys (what an incredible poem one read at the other's funeral).<br />The two main characters were sexual slimeballs. I hated this movie.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|After five years as a band, a demo tape produced by Gene Simmons of KISS led to a recording contract for David Lee Roth, Michael Anthony, and Alex and Eddie Van Halen.  Thus was the beginning of of metal's biggest bands, made so by the new wave of guitar sophistication ushered in by Eddie Van Halen, including wild and wooly growling, roaring, and elephant bellowing effects, and Roth's loud, swaggering vocals and overly suggestive performances.  But his schtick is fun too, that's the point.  Their debut album is a classic, an embodiment of high-energy heavy metal/hard rock, exemplified by \\"Running With The Devil,\\" one of their best hits, with a steady marching pace rhythm.<br />The instrumental \\"Eruption\\" was described by musicologist Robert Walser as \\"one minute and twenty-seven seconds of exuberant and playful virtuosity, a violinist's precise and showy technique inflected by the vocal rhetoric of the blues and rock and roll irreverence.\\"  Fiery, explosive, with a definitely classical influence.  True, 80's metal may have as its forerunners groups like Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, but one mustn't forget classical music's influence on metal.  Following Richie Blackmore's Bach progression on Deep Purple's \\"Highway Star,\\" so too did Eddie Van Halen embody a guitar virtuosity that made him a legend, as he was named Guitar Player magazine's best rock guitarist for five years straight.<br />They then cover the Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me,\\" which surpasses the original in terms of guitar power, and here's where Roth's thunderous showman's schtick comes in, and he gets the \\"oh yeah!\\" down pat.<br />\\"Ain't Talking About Love\\"--definitely not.  David Lee Roth's macho, sexist, and slightly perverse schitck is embodied in \\"I got something you need... my love is rotten to core\\" and describing the girl as \\"semi-good looking,\\" advising her that she better look for a friend, is quite left-handed to say the least.  The beginning part of this song was sampled in 2 Live Crew's \\"The F--- Shop\\" on As Nasty As They Wanna Be.<br />The thundering, frantic, freight train-paced \\"I'm The One\\" is something Roth used in his Eat'em And Smile in \\"Shy Boy\\" except that it doesn't match the energy of the earlier barn-burner.  And what a wrap-up after the doo-wop-like interlude!  Whew!<br />If the next song is familiar, it's because \\"Jamie's Crying\\" was the song around which Tone-Loc sampled \\"Wild Thing.\\"  The heartbreaking aftermath of a one-night stand, a wish for some more is why Jamie's crying.<br />\\"Atomic Punk\\" and \\"On Fire\\" are further examples of the band's wild and woolly theatrics, with the latter getting into some surfing motifs--\\"I'm hangin' ten now baby, as I ride your sonic, ooh wave\\" and being in the girl's presence both via their headphones, and ultimately their beds.<br />\\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" is another example of David Lee Roth's macho swagger, trying to impress some girl with the cliched pickup lines like her being the prettiest girl he's ever known, and get her so that \\"by morning you'll be mine, yes, all mine.\\"<br />The guys then cover John Brim's \\"Ice Cream Man\\" a playful ode to old-fashioned rock and roll that starts with a soft bluesy tone before exploding into the usual Van Halen theatrics.<br /><br />All I can say about this classic debut album, which went 6X platinum, is, to alter a line from \\"Ice Cream Castle,\\" \\"all ...flavours are guaranteed to satisfy.\\"--- Shop\\" on As Nasty As They Wanna Be.<br />The thundering, frantic, freight train-paced \\"I'm The One\\" is something Roth used in his Eat'em And Smile in \\"Shy Boy\\" except that it doesn't match the energy of the earlier barn-burner.

0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men is by far my most favorite John Steinbeck novel. Of Mice and Men takes place in California where we meet Lennie and George; they are both farm workers going from farm to farm working in the fields. Both Lennie and George are both two different people, but they each have their own strong points and weak points; Lennie is strong, but has the brain of a five year old, George is smart, but not strong like Lennie. A lot of times, George decides for Lennie, and Lennie is almost never left alone by himself. So they come to a farm and do some work, but the farmers wife comes around, and she is known for messing around with the other farm workers, so he keeps his wife on a short lease. As the story progresses, George and Lennie feel their friendship come closer, and you start to care for Lennie because he does not know any better, so you feel sorry for him. Now one night, Lennie is left alone, and the farmers wife comes to Lennie who is in the barn, and hurts one of his animals, so he takes him in his arms and violently shakes her, eventually killing her. The Lennie tries to bring her back to life, then failing. So when George comes back to the farm, so now everyone in the farm goes hunting for Lennie. So with shotguns ready to kill Lennie, George looks for Lennie and eventually see's him, and rescus's him from his misery; killing him with the shotgun. <br />It is a sad tale, but yet very warming and yet very good. This is an American classic, but yet still very good even as old as this book is. A definite read, I have read this book three times and yet it stills one of my favorite books by John Steineck
B000127LW2|3.0|Star Trek Voyager has taken a lot of flack.  'The Red Headed Step Child' of the Trek family took a lot of shots for being mediocre retreads of other Trek stories which had to resort to some cosmic eye-candy to pull in new viewers.  Frankly, I think the series has been given the short end of the stick.  The ensemble does a fine job, and its good to see a Trek show visiting 'strange new worlds' once more.  Its great to see Jennifer Lien(Time and Again) again, and Bob Picardo's Doctor is especially comical in this first season(Heros &amp; Demons).  So aces for the episodes found in this collection.  The extras are pretty good, too.  The piece on Captain Bujold is nearly worth the price of admission alone.<br />But speaking of the price...  C'mon Paramount !  You've been slowly dropping the price on the Trek boxed sets, but we're not nearly where we should be.  ESPECIALLY when there are only 15 episodes in this first 'season' of Voyager.  And the packaging is truly horrendous.  I'm sure this was someone's idea of a clever novelty, but its just downright awkward and cheap.  If you're going to ask us to pay upwards of a hundred bucks, at least give us something worthwhile.  So as I say, the material is good, but there should be more to offset the price, and the packaging should rise to the quality of the content !

B0000CFW87|5.0|How does one describe this album? It's the crash of the sea on a shore, it's the dance of leaves on the wind, it's the beat of your heart as it races to one of the most beautiful male voices of this generation. If you speak English and you are intimidated by the fact that many of the songs are in French, Spanish and Italian -- forget your fears. Josh Groban will move you, with or without words.
0140042520|5.0|I've heard it said that this is Kerouac's greatest novel. I still say that honor is held by On the Road, but this book is just as good. And it is his most spiritual novel. Kerouac combines his talent at writing with his philosophy of life and what you have is a powerful tool to enlightenment. This book should be read on at least two levels, as a work of great literature and as a theological tool. I can't recommend it enough.
B000002H6C|5.0|Man, I'm really into Metallica. They're practically the only band I listen too; AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is a bad-ass album. To be honest, I didn't like it when I first listened to it. But with repeated listenings, the album is tight. Of course it's not better then MASTER OF PUPPETS, but maybe in the same area as RIDE THE LIGHTNING. <br />Anyway, my favorite songs are the three I most listen too: BLACKENED, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and ONE. The rest are pretty cool too. But those three are one of the best songs Metallica has ever made in their astounding career. Oh yeah, whoever who talks crap about Metallica sucks. FOREVER METALLICA!
B00009W0WM|5.0|Yes, \\"Play it!\\" is what Bogart actually commands pianist Sam (played by Dooley Wilson) to do in that timeless, priceless classic \\"Casablanca\\". No genuine movie buff can ever forget that song with those ultra-romantic lines, \\"A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is still a sigh.\\" Bogart as Rick is outstanding in his portrayal of an idealistic, intriguing anti-fascist adventurer with a facade of cynicism. In many ways he is better than James Bond. Immaculate in his white dinner jacket, he feels betrayed by the love of his life, Ilsa and harbours a deep seated grudge and resentment against her for not meeting him at the train station in Paris to flee from the Nazis. Rick is a hard man with a heart of pure 24 karat gold. It is a troubled time when the Nazi Wehrmacht invades Paris. Rick has to flee because he fought against Franco's Fascists in Spain and is on the Geheim Staats Polizei black list. It is better known as the Gestapo.  The story set against a Europe ablaze with the fiery flames of a terrible war, is of the eternal triangle with 2 men in love with a beautiful woman, namely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. Her screen presence is as large as Bogie's and her elegant and ethearel beauty is absolutely mesmerizing. The chemistry between the two sizzle like a fondue. My all time favourite scene is where Captain Renault, the corrupt French Prefect of Police asks Rick, \\"Why did you come to Casablanca?\\". Rick says nonchalantly, \\"My health, I came here for the waters.\\" Stunned, Renault interjects, \\"Waters, what waters? We're in the middle of the desert!\\" Rick calmly drawls sardonically, \\"I was misinformed.\\" Another classic scene is when Captain Renault closes Rick's Cafe Americain and says, \\"I'm shocked, shocked to find there's illegal gambling here\\". Rick's fat waiter comes along and gives Renault some money which he won at the gambling tables and says, \\"Your winnings, Sir\\". Such true to life corruption and satirism is hard to find in any movie nowadays. I have seen this movie many times but I never get tired of it and I learn something new every time I see it. It inspires me every time. Another amusing thing is that many of the characters are named after cars, for example Ferrari and Renault. One intriguing question you must ask yourself is whether Rick committed adultery by making mad, passionate love to Ilsa the whole night long when she desperately tried all means to get the letters of transit for her husband. Did they or did they not. The Director never spells it out but leaves it to your imagination. Later, she schemes with Rick to leave Casablanca together and abandon her husband to the Nazis. However, Rick is too good a gentleman to break up their marraige. Instead he rescues them from the Germans. One round from his trusty blue nosed .45 calber Colt autoloader into the Nazi Major's black heart and it's curtains for him. Rick then walks off into the sunrise cooly with his good friend, Louis, saying those immortal lines, \\"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\\"<br />Recently, I was in the Westin St. Francis San Francisco and as I was leaving the Compass Rose, my friend the resident pianist played my favourite song for me and it made my day. It was \\"As Time Goes By\\" from Casablanca. This song like the movie lives forever in the hall of the immortals.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Boy, this is a divisive one. I have to come down on the side of the ayes. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; was one of the best movies of last year. This and &quot;Mystic River&quot; both blew me away, but in completely different ways. <br />One thing they both have in common is that they really reward repeated viewing.  There's so much subtext in &quot;Mystic River&quot; that you catch a second time. And the same goes for this one.<br />It seems everybody has said everything about &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; with this many votes, so I don't know what more can be said. You've got to try it for yourself. What some people love - the fact that everything isn't put into words - other people hate. For those who think that no matter how depressed and tired you are you should just go out and play pachinko or play tourist, this movie will never work. It's clear to Charlotte her marriage is not going to work. It doesn't seem clear to everyone who sees the movie though. It was to me.  <br />A modern dancer - the serious kind - said to me recently, &quot;Audiences just keep wanting things to get faster and faster. They have no patience with waiting.&quot; It seems sadly true. I was happy to wait. Not a lot happens in Zen gardens either for some. Everything does for others. <br />I can hardly fault this movie, although the DVD is a bit disappointing. We deserved more extras. <br />Bill and Scarlett are great. Sofia Coppola - magnificent job. It's interesting that to those attuned to this movie, it's not vague at all. Nor is it boring. It's funny to see a one star review saying of Charlotte &quot;If you're bored, you're boring&quot;, when the MAIN thing most one star reviews here say is &quot;I was bored&quot;<br />When are we going to see a Japanese one set in New York? That would be equally strange. Oh, and to the guy who expected Bruce Lee to turn up in this &quot;cliched view of Japan&quot;, it would have been funny if he did seeing he's Chinese.
0451163540|1.0|This has got to be the worst book Ken Follett ever wrote.<br />The story is ridiculous. Would the KGB, at the height of the cold war, really let some English woman on one of their prized spy ships, give her free reign to move around, and relate to her all the details of their top secret sources and methods? Please.<br />And of course a flight attendant has the skills to outwit a ship full of hardened KGB agents, and figure out how to destroy the ship, all in a few hours. Hello! And by the way, Ken, diesel fuel cannot be ignited by a cigarette.<br />The style was completely naive and painful to read as well. Endless exposition outside of the action, a rough draft of a book at best. If you like spy novels, read &quot;The spy who came in from the cold.&quot; That's how spy novels should be written.<br />People giving 5 stars for this tripe? Can you say &quot;shill&quot;?

B00005JMFQ|5.0|First off, I just want to say that I have never ever submitted an online review of any kind but I loved this movie so much, that I wanted to share my input. I saw this movie in the theatre and have been anxiously waiting for the DVD to come out. It has everything a romantic comedy should have, its funny, heartfelt, has a great cast of characters with many great actors. There have been complaints that there are too many storylines which cause undeveloped characters.  I didn't feel this way at all, I thought that it was unique and kept the movie more interesting with little room for boredom.  I loved that all kinds of love was explored, not just the traditional love between a man and woman.  It's a movie that will make you think, laugh, and cry.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a southern boy who is not so much bright. He is in love with a girl name Jenny Curran (Robin Wright Penn ) who is Forest's friend, but just likes him as a friend. He's known her ever since they were little. She then moves on in war and peace marches of the Vietnam War, which then leads Forrest to go to fight in the Vietnam War. His friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) gets killed and Forrest promises to help Bubba's family with the mortgages. He then meets Lt. Dan Taylor (Gary Sinise) who gets his legs blown off in the war. Which then loses his money and Forrest invests with him in a fishing business. Forest then sadly loses his mother by a fight against basically old age. Jenny then comes back to his life and realizes he has a kid. Jenny then loses a fight with a bad cold which then dies. A very sad film with Forrest Gump has to move on.<br />It is a very sad tragic movie that can really move you. It can be very touching, which can make you drop a tear. It is very moving which if you haven't seen you got to watch this film. It is a must see if you haven't. I don't really think it should have won best picture, I liked it but I liked Pulp Fiction better. Tom Hanks's performance is very great and truly deserved the Oscar. It also can be very heart warming in a sensitive way. The cinematography in this film is very breath taking. It can blow your mind. This movie can touch anyone and when you stop watching this film, it's just a feeling you can't explain.<br />This DVD includes commentary by Robert Zemeckis, Steve Starkey and Rick Carter, but it would have been better if they had commentary by Tom Hanks. It also has behind the scenes, art design featurattes. This is a 2 disc set DVD, and widescreen. It also has the trailer and TV spots of the film. It also has interviews with the cast and crew. With Tom Hanks, Robert Zemeckis and more. This could have had better features though like the backstory they had on AMC. Other than that these special features are pretty good. You have to get this film or if you haven't seen it you need to watch this spectacular film. A definite must.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|I never enjoyed Sarah's music. She is a pitiful musician and is in my opinion only 'average'. Her new C-D is one of her typical depressing and boring albums. I would not reccomend this to anyone, except those who like very slow, flat music. After a few times though, you will tire from it completely. This is my opinion to those who spend their time reading this, and if yours is different and you decide to buy this than good for you!

The Broc Lesnar and Golberg match was just very very terrible. The worst match I have ever seen. It was very interesting though because they were booing at brock because he is leaving the wrestling buisness to go to the NFL. Fans were chanting \\"Broc sold out!!!\\". They should have just ended the match in like 10 minutes. <br />The match that was very great was the main event. That was the most intense match I have ever seen. That was the best match of the night. It was very just bloody and technical. I also liked the match between Eddie Gurrero and Kurt Angle. That match was very good too. The Big Show and John Cena match was suprisingly good. It was pretty good. The cruserweight thing I expected more. Ultimo Dragon should have won that match. It should have been a battle royal. That sucks that Molly got her head shave. And how can I forget the Undertakers return. His costume entrance was ok but he still has the tanktop. I was expecting the old costume.

B0000C6E4D|2.0|Once upon a time, Sarah McLachlan could rock.  I understand if you don't believe me; it's not a quality that shines through on any of her albums.  But if you can find one, pick up a tape or a bootleg of one of her older live performances--any tour through \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" will do--and try to tell me that this wasn't a transcendently great rock artist.  There's even a hint of it in the version of \\"Possession\\" found on the live release, \\"Mirrorball.\\"  There is nothing in pop music more entrancing than beautiful melodies that rock.<br />But whither Sarah McLachlan now?  After breaking though, albeit over the course of several years, with the modern classic that was \\"Fumbling,\\" she opted for a more conventional set of ballads and pop songs on \\"Surfacing.\\"  That album was still listenable, if only because the melodies were among her best yet--\\"Adia\\" in particular.  But along with that release, the live \\"Mirrorball\\" recording was an unfortunate sign of things to come, reaching an artistic nadir in a performance of \\"I Will Remember You\\" that was a note-for-note recreation of the studio version, and as such, an utterly pointless exercise all the way around.<br />Now we come to \\"Afterglow,\\" written and recorded after the close juxtaposition of the death of McLachlan's mother and the birth of her child.  I wish her the best, but from my perspective neither of these events justifies the syrupy wasteland of ballads she's given us here.  There is a fine line between pretty and over-pretty, and McLachlan doesn't even bother trying to straddle it anymore.  It often seems on this album that she is turning herself into Sarah _Brightman_.  If you think that's a fine ambition, then this release is probably right up your alley.  The rest of us deserve better than that.  Sarah McLachlan is capable of _much_ better than that.<br />It's curiously appropriate, though, that the new release should be named \\"Afterglow,\\" presumably a reference to the distinctly female experience of tenderness and satisfaction after really good sex.  Appropriate from this male perspective, anyway, since after one listen I just wanted to go to sleep.
B000005JA8|1.0|Nonsense and hoi-polloi.  Atrocious stupidity, and a waste of time to boot.  Here's a tip, sort the ratings by most helpful, and see what you find.  This album is a joke, and a few jerks are trying to raise its ratings artificially so that more people get taken in.  It's mean, and it's a lousy thing to do to someone else.  All of the good reviews admit that it's arrhythmic, atonal, raspy, gritty, bad musicianship, with bass that sounds like someone falling downstairs, etc.  Think to yourself: how could this be simultaneously so unpleasant to listen to, but also worthy of 5 stars?  Of course, it can't be.  It's a stupid prank, and so are the 5 star reviews.  Half the time they insult your intelligence, and the other half of the time, they try to make you insecure.  Trust me, you'll be a lot better off without a nonsensical headache like this in your collection.<br />-Paul-
B00005JKC3|3.0|I watched this movie solely out of loyalty--to the comic books I read in my youth, to fond memories of the old Hulk TV show starring Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno (who appears in a brief cameo early in the film, and looks stiff even without a line to speak).  The reason for my reluctance, of course, was the parade of negative reviews, along with uniformly bad word-of-mouth.  The movie was supposed to be slow, with corny-looking CG effects and too much comic-book hokum to try to make sense of.<br />Well, it's all true.  By modern action-movie standards, this one is pretty slow to develop.  His enormous green badness doesn't make his first appearance until more than 40 minutes into the film.  The CG-animated Hulk occasionally looks exactly like a CG-animated Hulk, and after Spielberg's dinosaurs this might be a disappointment.  And while most of the comic book silliness does manage to hold together, the final conflict is a step too far, and difficult to follow besides.  On top of this, Eric Bana is not the most convincing actor you'll see, and Nick Nolte's performance as Bruce Banner's criminally psychotic, mad genius father is entirely a matter of personal taste.  At one point in the movie, the Hulk picks up a tank by its gun and swings it around like he's performing the hammer throw at the Olympics; only a few seconds later, as if to underscore what exactly is physically impossible about this (even after you've accepted the notion of a big green man who can throw a tank thousands of feet), he bends the gun of another tank, and the tank fails to move. Finally, we are forced to swallow the now completely discredited fad notion of repressed memories as a psychological motivation for our man Bruce Banner.<br />Ugh.<br />To balance this, however, we do have Ang Lee's completely arresting visual style, augmented here by the use of split screens in what must be meant as an homage to the comic book medium from which the Hulk originates.  What others seem to perceive as &quot;slow&quot; I perceive as &quot;well-paced.&quot;  Lee is a good filmmaker, not a maker of music videos, and his care does show.<br />So does his seriousness, and this really seems to set a lot of people off.  Do these critics really believe the movie would or could have been better if Lee had brought more campiness to it?  Or is there some deeper need to relegate a character from a comic book to a style they can view with ironic detachment?  For in the end, the Hulk is little more than Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with more fireworks, and I seem to remember that Stevenson's tale had more going for it than campy shenanigans.  The word &quot;archetype&quot; comes to mind...<br />There's a lot to quibble about in this film, even if you take it for entertainment value alone.  But there's a lot here that other action-film makers could learn from.  A lot of viewers, too.<br />Postscript:  the extras in the two-disc version are no more or less than you might expect.  I don't really have the time to watch these sorts of things anymore--working for living and all--but in general I've found that too much of these &quot;making of&quot; documentaries can interfere with enjoying the film as a _film_, with forgetting the artifice of it all and losing myself in the movie.  Deleted scenes are particularly deadly in this respect.  Only the &quot;true&quot; fan will want to watch them all.  The rest of us should settle for the single-disc version if we settle for any version at all.
B00004Z400|5.0|This album is a thoughtful, artful masterpiece. Haunting, beautiful, brutal. One of my favorite all time metal albums.
B000068FUS|5.0|I have not been able to stop listening to this since I bought it a few weeks ago.  While that really means I need to get a life, it doesn't change the fact that this is a truly fantastic album.  Smart lyrics!  Also, they managed to hit the right balance of &quot;concept&quot; in the idea of &quot;concept album&quot;...the recurring Skynrd/VanZant images--and, more importantly, the constant riffing on established Skynrd guitar hooks--never get hoaky or overdone (in my opinion, anyway).  Upshot:  for those who loved southern rock in its early incarnations and became totally disgusted with Skynrd's flabby progeny, this album is a KEEPER!
B000089RVR|5.0|My fiance picked this up for me as a gift, and I was prepared not to like it (I had grown tired of her first album, so I hadn't listened to it for a while).  So, I played this CD softly in the background as I did come computer work, to get a general feel for it.  And I hit replay, and replay, and replay.  Then, I put it on in my car for my drive to work.  Magic.  I found myself singing the lyrics (in my head!) while I worked, lyrics that I didn't even know I had learned.  So insidiously addictive...  <br />The 2nd and 5th tracks are fantastic late night expressway driving songs, and the 11th track is my favorite - but why the heck did they hide &quot;Closer&quot; at the end of it - it should stand alone, it's so fantastic!  I don't hate listening to &quot;See the Sun&quot; to hear &quot;Closer&quot; but hey!  &quot;Closer&quot; is the ultimate &quot;friend into lover&quot;/&quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot; for the young generation song.  I think every song on the album is easy to listen to, though, but we all have our favorites!<br />Great job, Dido!
B000069AUI|4.0|With the exception of Track 9, this is a great album.  Although not recommended for someone who has recently had a relationship break-up.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|When Is This It came out, the strokes blew all the constant competition away. This album is proof that they're staying on course.<br /><br />1.What Ever Happened - This is a classic strokes song, but it seems a little more expanded. Leaves us wondering whether Julian Casablancas is a Tennessee Williams fan.<br />2.Reptilia - Title Room On Fire comes from this song. Mad guitar riff breaks between the verse and chorus.<br />3.Automatic Stop - This is something different. You can see their influences go beyond the Velvet Underground etc. Reggae-like guitars, but not overpowering.<br />4.12:51 - To my amazement that sound is made by a guitar, Albert works it again. Good feeling type of song.<br />5.You Talk Way Too Much - Julian's voice is really great on this one. It's powerful and rockin but then the chorus is really smooth.<br />6.Between Love and Hate - Formerly this was played at shows as \\"Ze Newie\\" and a lot of fans dubbed it a classic before the album came out. It doesn't seem like it would stand out so much at first, but it takes you by surprise.<br />7.Meet Me In the Bathroom - Awesome song. Thanks for being rockstars, guys.<br />8.Under Control - Here is the side we have not seen any of. It's a slower tempo song, somewhat of a slow dance flow. I don't think anyone had any idea this was coming. Shows promise for where they are going.<br />9.The Way It Is - Kind of angry, but kind of mello. Good song but it lacks some type of punch.<br />10.The End Has No End - Great song, good beat. Classic strokies. Definitely a sing along.<br />11.I Can't Win - Goes down with Take it Or Leave it as a great ender. Really catchy. Lyrics are very witty and funny.<br /><br />Over all the album is a little less gritty, but no less fun than the last album. Favorite tracks are What Ever Happened, Between Love and Hate, Meet Me In The Bathroom, and The End Has No End. Room On Fire is great from start to end.
B000068FY1|4.0|This album set the tone not just for the rest of the Jayhawks' albums, but for the burgeoning Americana movement.  When you listen to &quot;Two Angels,&quot; there's no mistaking how Wilco owes as much to this album as to all of Uncle Tupelo.  In a song like &quot;Wichita,&quot; you can hear the roots of everything Ryan Adams has cut.  &quot;Hollywood Town Hall&quot; is both seminal and a good listen in its own right.<br />But it's imperfect.  There's not a lot of variation, structurally, from one disc to another.  It's easy for your attention to wander and the songs to blend together.  This is a shame, since each song is thematically distinct; but when the instrumentation sounds the same from track to track, you can miss it.<br />Some star tracks, like &quot;Nevada, California,&quot; or &quot;Sistar Cry,&quot; really do stand out, especially if you listen to Americana radio and have heard them before.  And all the songs, with there Dylan-like opacity, suggest a much larger story behind what they tell us.  This disk really presages everything good that was destined to come out of alt-country in the twelve years between this album and now.<br />Unfortunately, if you're not already into the genre, this isn't the album for you.  But for those of us who love Americana, this is a sort of &quot;Missing Link&quot; album, and much worth listening to.  Just remember, if your attention wanders, don't be afraid to listen to it again and again.  It will grow on you, and very quickly too.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This film has lost none of its charm since it was first released more than 50 years ago. Audrey Hepburn's performance as Princess Anne earned her an Academy Award for best actress in a leading role. If metropolitan areas were also eligible, Rome would have provided her strongest competition; in no other film has it looked lovelier. Director William Wyler brilliantly coordinates Hepburn's performance with those of Gregory Peck (Joe Bradley. a journalist) and Eddie Albert (Irving Radovich, a photographer). There really is not much to the plot.<br />While visiting Rome, a beautiful young princess decides to take a holiday from her royal obligations. Of course, she sneaks out of her mansion one evening dressed casually, has too much to drink, is \\"rescued\\" from any possible trouble by a journalist (Peck) who does not at first recognize her, briefly explores the city under his supervision, and then returns to her royal obligations. And of course, the journalist falls in love with her. For that reason, he decides not to take advantage of her to produce with his associate (Albert) an exclusive feature story with numerous photographs of her roman holiday. On and off the screen, there was mutual respect and affection between Peck and Hepburn. Provided with an Academy Award-winning screenplay (co-authored by Ian McLellan Hunter, John Dichton, and Dalton Trumbo) and under Wyler's direction, they create a unique form of magic together in this film which is as much a holiday in Rome for the viewer as it is for the young princess.<br />I am reluctant to call it a \\"romp\\" because of its style, grace, and wit but it certainly has a number of playful moments. The final sequence, Princess Anne's press conference, is presented with exquisite taste, especially when she and Bradley reluctantly bid each other an obviously fond but necessary farewell. I hasten to add that, in my opinion, Eddie Albert's talents as a versatile actor have never really received the recognition and appreciation they and he deserve. (He is outstanding as Captain Erskine Cooney in Attack!, as Mr. Corcoran in The Heartbreak Kid, and as Warden Hazen in The Longest Yard.)  I cannot think of another actor better suited for the role of Irving Radovich. Others in the supporting cast are also first-rate but the dominant images are of Hepburn and Rome, as well they should be.n they and he deserve.

B00018D44U|5.0|I have listened to the CD, I own the CD and I think that it's great. I absolutely loved &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; with the exception of a few songs and I believe that her latest CD is no different. It's wonder, great to listen to and beautifully put together. I have to agree with Thomas R. Hrdlick &quot;home indeed&quot; when he said that he didn't understand why people were saying that it was a disappointment when the CD is the perfect follow up to &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. I'm 14 years old and I only listen to RnB and Rap so for me to say that I thought the CD was an amazing is definitely saying something.
B000001FN3|5.0|Forget about the pop songs that Alan Parsons made later in the 80's, this is a completely different approach to music.  I'm not even a diehard Alan Parsons fan but this is truly a masterpiece of effort and inventiveness.<br />Parsons decided to take the works of Edgar Allen Poe and put them to music, and I don't think it could have been done better.  Poe has always been one of my favorite writers, allowing me to sift through a human mind on its decline through the many layers of madness.  Heavy use of synthesizers creates a fantasy world full of the moods and emotions Poe used in his writing.<br />Dream Within A Dream is an instrumental, nearly classical piece, with an introductory reading by Orson Wells, a slow heavy beat of drums and bass joined by keyboards reminiscent of a harpsichord and choir type vocal accompaniment.  The synthesized riffs are vaguely similar to the Priest's theme from The Exorcist, an apt association of dread for this moody piece.<br />Dream Within A Dream blends smoothly into The Raven, probably the most popular piece on this album.  It is masterpiece of Poe's famous poem set to music, with the vocals eerily sang using a vocoder, and the choir accompaniment in the background.  The synthesizer brings out more horn sounds, and the music, while still eerie, has a more triumphant and powerful sound to it than Dream.<br />The Tell Tale Heart starts out with a scream of derangement, and brings the album into its rock genre with a faster, pounding beat and more guitar than keyboard.  The vocals are purposefully stressed into a pitch that expertly portrays the lunacy of the murderer's descent into madness as the old man's beating heart refuses to stop its tormenting clamor, and incorporates some of the actual lines from Poe's unforgettable tale of unleashed insanity.  The bass line in this song does indeed sound like a rapidly pulsing heart, louder and louder as sanity is cast aside.<br />The Cask of Amontillado slows the pace back down, in a gentle melody reminiscent of The Beatles \\"She's Leaving Home\\", with similar tune and pitch, but more powerful in its chorale moments.  I really felt that Parsons did a tremendous job on this tune not only with the music but with the lyrics, telling (as close as three verses possibly can) the summation of this tale of murder.  Of particular note are the echoes of the voice of Fortunato behind Montresor's in the chorus, overlapping each other as the exchange of words between the two within that dank cellar would have, yet eerily gentle rather than desperately pleading.<br />\\"What are these chains that are binding my arm?\\" (Fortunato)<br />\\"Part of you dies each passing day.\\" (Montresor)<br />\\"Say it's a game and I'll come to no harm.\\" (Fortunato)<br />\\"You'll feel your life slipping away.\\" (Montresor)<br />\\"Spare me my life only name your reward.\\" (Fortunato)<br />\\"Part of you dies each brick I lay.\\" (Montresor)<br />\\"Bring back some light in the name of the Lord.\\" (Fortunato)<br />\\"You'll feel your mind slipping away.\\" (Montresor)<br />With classical strings sawing off notes as a ticking clock would pass the seconds of agonizing time, powerful horn sounds, and the gentle, deadly lyrics, I think this song is really one of the masterpieces of the album though it never got the recognition some of the other songs did.<br />The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether is the obvious choice on the album for radio play, a tiny bit obvious that it was intended to be the breakout song for the album, though I believe The Raven actually became more popular.  An excellent choice for the theme, the very nature of the story itself brings the beat of the music back up into the more rock orientated aspects of rhythmic drums and lots of guitar riffs, and deep voices chanting \\"Just what you need to make you feel better\\" in the background.  While it doesn't delve into the actual story behind the music as much as some of the other pieces, the music does portray a certain maniacal glee within it, and manages to fit in quite nicely with the eerier and more lyrically elaborate compositions; and adds some fun by bringing in the sounds of applause and overlaying riffs from both The Raven and Dream Within A Dream at the end of the song.<br />The Fall of the House of Usher is the major masterpiece of this musical representation of Poe, just as the book is one of the more famous examples of his literary genius.  Usher is comprised of five separate movements; and is a beautiful, classical composition of mood and mystery, death and decay, body and spirit, insufferable gloom, and the storms that raze the walls of body and mansion.<br />The first movement, a seven minute piece called Prelude starts with another oration by Orson Wells, and is soft and almost flirtatious in places, forceful and climaxing in others, incorporating a feeling of anticipation or longing within the notes; and ending aptly with the sounds of a powerful thunderstorm and driving rain.<br />The second movement is a two and a half minute piece called Arrival, and picks up with the sounds of the storm, and speeds into a climax of synthesizer and drums, falling softly off into a languid beat and morose guitars before the synthesizer builds back up to its peak once again.<br />The third movement is called Intermezzo, and is only one minute in length, not much more than eerie sounds of a cathedral type organ, that plays its self out into the fourth movement called Pavane.<br />In Pavane we hear more bell-like synthesizer and guitar, again reminiscent of the Priest's song in Exorcist, but underlain with a throatier, progressive foundation from synthesizer and bass, until about three minutes into the melody it picks up with the addition of drums and a building crescendo of escalating volume and tension.  I believe this is the movement that Parson's actually used a glockenspiel in, though with his ability to make synthesizers sound like whatever he wanted them to, its hard for me to tell if it's the real thing or not.<br />The last movement of The Fall of the House of Usher is a mercifully short (51 second) instrumental scream of anguish, building kettle drums and an escalating noise from the synthesizer along with what sounds like feedback shrieks.  The does, however, symbolize the ending of Poe's work; where, \\"There was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters - and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the House of Usher.\\"<br />The last song on the album is a great disappointment to me.  To One In Paradise is a real poem by Edgar Allen Poe, a stunningly beautiful poem of anguish and lost love.  Instead of incorporating Poe's work into the actual structure of this melody as he did with The Raven and The Tell Tale Heart, he used sappy and uninspiring lyrics about \\"believing in your dreams\\".  Pah!  The music is very \\"Pop\\" orientated and softly saccharin, and only at the very end of the tune did Parsons add an oration from the real poem; \\"And all my days are trances, and all my nightly dreams, are where thy gray eye glances, and where thy footstep gleams, in what ethereal dances, by what eternal streams.\\", but the narrator can barely be heard above the syrupy sighs of the chorus and the gentle riffs of the music.  I just don't believe that a touchy-feelie, good-mood, gentle and happy song like this belongs to any of Poe's work whatsoever.  The mood should have been as dark and anguished as the poem itself.<br />There you have it.  Altogether one of the most original musical works of art to this day, it manages to cross the time barrier of evolving rock and electronica, and still hold its own in the top ranks with its eclectic creativity.  Pick up a copy, get some headphones, and enjoy yourself.manages to fit in quite nicely with the eerier and more lyrically elaborate compositions; and adds some fun by bringing in the sounds of applause and overlaying riffs from both The Raven and Dream Within A Dream at the end of the song.<br />The Fall of the House of Usher is the major masterpiece of this musical representation of Poe, just as the book is one of the more famous examples of his literary genius.

B00009V8Z9|4.0|This CD is mediocre. It is good for a first CD, but after a while it gets repeditive. I like it though.
0385504209|5.0|I came by at this book by total chance, wandering around the bookstore looking for a good read, when by chance a woman stopped nearby and picked up a copy of The Da Vinci Code. I read a few pages, and I was grabbed. Eventually I bought it, finished, and loved it. I do not know much about art history, biblical passages, beliefs and/or studies. However, as I read through quite a few of these reviews, it was a bit...shocking, if I may, that people seem to dislike the book very much. I don't recall seeing as many 1 and 2 stars on a book rating on this than any other. I am trying to word this review very carefully as not to offend someone. I understand that many people would dislike the book for it's supposed/demanding inaccuracy in certain people's religions. Brown may or may not have researched thoroughly, but for goodness sake, it is fiction. I don't believe that Brown would intentionally try to offend someone. The book is targeting and a huge conspiracy. Whether it true or false, it is a good book, and many should appreciate the hard work many authors put into writing a book. For that, and a good read, I give it a five.
B00005MP58|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It truly is a great movie and I highly recommend it. I really loved Lizzie and Darcy's characters. And Colin Firth, who plays Darcy, is so hot!
1401300901|5.0|I loved this book. It made me laugh, cry. I became addicted to reading this novel..It has been a long time since I have read a quick fun read like this! I recomend this to anyone who is looking for a great novel.
0792833201|4.0|This 1982 horror film is from writer/producer Steven Spielberg, who purportedly gave the director's seat to Tobe Hooper, revered director of the classic slasher flick THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974).  It has been long rumored, however, that Spielberg kept Hooper under such tight reins that POTERGEIST is, in effect, really all Spielberg's.  But regardless of whose vision it may be, POTERGEIST is a very scary and very entertaining movie--a worthy entry in the horror genre.<br />After its cloyingly honeyed opening sequence, POTERGEIST shifts gears and becomes both a powerfully frightening suburban haunted-house story and an eerie contemporary tale of ESP and the paranormal.  Unseen spirits enter a tract home via the TV and cause some minor spooky mischief, then graduate to more violent and corporeal grotesqueries.  When a little girl gets sucked into the netherworld, psychic investigators and a freaky little clairvoyant are called in to do a little ghost-busting and rescue the child.<br />Most of the scares are cinematically original and genuinely scary, with many that play upon common (and in adults, buried but extant) childhood fears.  The creepiest of these is a scene where a gnarly tree comes to life and pulls a child out the bedroom window, and a little episode with an evil clown doll is a real spine-tingler, too.<br />POTERGEIST is a well-planned, solidly structured film that first carefully establishes an unearthly ambiance, then pushes the audience inexorably towards its heart-stopping preternatural crescendo.  Admittedly, the way in which the protagonists resolve their crisis seems somewhat contrived and therefore rather weak, but the film is so well acted and most of it so effectively frightening that the one minor flaw can be easily forgiven.<br />The DVD from Warner Home Video is a no-frills package, which in this case means you get the theatrical trailer and the option of watching the film in full-screen pan-and-scan or anamorphic widescreen.  But the digital transfer looks very good, and the retail price is quite reasonable, so this is one that undoubtedly deserves a spot in the film collections of all serious horror aficionados.digital transfer looks very good, and the retail price is quite reasonable, so this is one that undoubtedly deserves a spot in the film collections of all serious horror aficionados.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah McLachlan's latest CD is a work of beautiful music yet it is lacking that cetain bit on panache to make it as noteworthy as her previous efforts of Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Surfacing. Nevertheless, this CD is worth having with songs like<BR>Fallen,  Stupid, Train Wreck, Perfect Girl, and Dirty Little Secret. These songs give the album merit and have that graceful beauty that McLachlan gives every note.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I really wanted to really like this film.  While some complain about the introduction, it was OK with me.  What got to me the most was all the &quot;comic book layout&quot; scenes that kept popping up over and over and over and over.  After a while, I just wanted to scream at the director.  If there could be a version without those scenes, I'd definitely be interested in picking it up.  Until then, it stays on the shelf.
B000094DUP|5.0|Delta Goodrem has one of those voices that can appeal to a broad variety of styles, and personal tastes. She infuses each note with grace and elegance that makes each song noteworthy and hauntingly beautiful. Her piano playing adds a elegance to each song, with the steady pop background music makes each track catchy, sing-along-able and classic in its own right.
0783229526|5.0|Where this movie goes right and &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; goes wrong is in the directing and performances. The trick is also that the audience has to completly forget movie convention and just go along for the ride. &quot;Fear and loathing in Las Vegas&quot; is supposed to give us glimps into a world that we dont want to be in, and at the same time, add a little humor for good enjoymnt. Terry Gilliam scores another hit.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This CD is a decent cd. His lyrics are masterfully put together although his album should of had less skits and more songs. All in all a good album. 4/5
B00004Z459|5.0|this cd is increadible, buy it, i gaurntee you will love it.
6305428220|5.0|This movie may not be the most original thing to come out of teen flicks ( then again, name one teen flick that is original, especially when it concerns horror/thriller movies.) The point is, this movie is a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  But, it can only be fun if you don't over analyse it.  It does have a few story line flaws, but overal it is a really enjoyable experience. Kudos especially to Clea DuVall.  She is probablly the only hot girl who you'd buy as a Trekkie. While some of the characters seemed a little too cliche (Jordana Brewsters character, for example) overall it was a bunch who you could safely get invested in.  (ALthough Elijah would seemed to play the nerd with alot of personal experience.  ALso, fantasticly fun performance by Jon Stewart. ALl the performances were good, and the movie is definatley a fun ride if you just go with it.
0440237688|4.0|This was a great book! I was a little confused at reading it at first, but after a friend of mine told me to think of it as the matrix, I was able to read and understand it. The ending was not what I would have liked, but it was still an excellent book.
B000089RVR|3.0|I have liked Dido, eversince she released the single from the album &quot;No Angel&quot; which was &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;. After then, I watched her mature and become famous. Later on, she followed up with a worthy offering called &quot;Life For Rent&quot;. The first single was a smash! &quot;White Flag&quot;. This song has it all, a great melody, fantastic lyrics topped over with Dido's youthful, unique, and angelic voice. The singer is gorgeous as well but It's that voice that got me hooked all over! She is no Tina Arena or Celine Dion, but her voice has a distinct sound that cannot be compared to those high pitched divas.
B00004Z459|4.0|Wow!!!! This cd is great. You can see another of my L.P. Reviews on Meteora. Just scroll down until you find it. This cd rocks, but it isn't as good as Meteora. But don't exit out of the review just yet, and go buy Meteora. Read the review and you might hear of something you like.<br />1. Papercut: The music at the start is very awesome. It has a hard-rocking sound during the song, and changes towards the end. A great start for the cd.<BR>2. One Step Closer: Loud vocals and great rock music. What more could you ask for.<BR>3. With You: This song is great, even though it is not known by many people. The singing is cool, and so is the starting sound.<BR>4. Points of Authority: Definently one of my favorites. It absolutely has the best singing on this song.<BR>5. Crawling: I love the chorus! CRAWLING IN MY SKIN!!!!!!!!! THESE WORDS WILL NOT.....something or other, I forgot LOL!.<BR>6. Runaway: A cool chorus and loud singing.I WANNA RUN AWAY! NEVER SAY GOODBYE! I WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH! Instead of wondering why. I WANNA KNOW THE ANSWERS! NO MORE LIES! I WANNA SHUT THE DOOR! And open up my mind.<BR>7. By Myself: I don't really like this song as much as the others, but I still like it......a little.<BR>8. In The End: A Linkin Park single, with a great rapping-N-rocking sound.<BR>9. A Place For My Head: If anyone can tell my what Mike is singing at the beginning then I'd like to know. Still a good song though. Listen towards the end of the song, where Chester sings: you try to take the best of me go away. Repeat 4x. Then: GO AWAY! YOU TRY TO TAKE THE BEST OF ME! GO AWAY! YOU TRY TO TAKE THE BEST OF ME! GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! It rocks.<BR>10. Forgotten: AWESOME ROCKING AND RAPPING! A T.N.T packed song.<BR>11. Cure For The Itch: A disk-scratching and music song. No singing. But the music is phat!<BR>12. Pushing Me Away: No wonder they put it last. It is my least favorite. Worst than By Myself. Don't get me wrong, I still like the singing of the song.<br />I recommend getting this CD with Reanimation. Then you can here the remixes of these songs. Remember how I didn't like By Myself? Well the remix is tight! Also pick up Meteora. Look for more of my reviews on other rock bands. I am about to do one on Nickelback's old cd, called Silver Side Up. Look for it 3/18/04.<BR>See Ya Later Rock Fans!
B000002UAU|5.0|If it is to be law that every self-respecting music fan must own Sgt. Pepper, then I would amend that law to include The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album. Paul admits in the Beatles' Anthology book that Pet Sounds directly inspired and influenced the writing and recording of Sgt. Pepper. If you buy Sgt. Pepper, also buy The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. Contrast and compare. Learn.<br />Those who respond to Mr. Banned's reviews ... you've been punk'd.
0385504209|1.0|I am a PhD in philosophy, well-acquainted with art and ecclesiastical history, literature and theology.  The plot is foolish, it is weak and contrived, and the characters are cartoons.  Any soi-disant 'research' done in preparation for writing this book could've been better accomplished though Classics Comics.  Theological inconsistencies abound, such as a root question:  why might such a preposterous ruse ever have been initiated in the first place?  I noted that Brown refers to Leonardo as 'DaVinci,' a nomenclature never used by art historians, who refer to him as 'Leonardo.'  The representation of Opus Dei was patently fabricated ab ovo, bearing no relation to the real entity; this is the case whether one loves or loathes the prelature in question.  As is also the case with his other work, Brown is at it again making a fast dollar from a gullible and uncultivated public.
B000063UR2|4.0|The extras presented on this 2 disc DVD set are very interesting and worthy of your time. Director Ridley Scott provides a feature length commentary for the extended version of the film. In it, he reveals many interesting facts about the film and the cast, as well as revealing many special effects secrets that may surprise many people in their simplicity! The commentary moves along without any pauses and manages to keep your interest throughout. <br />The soundtrack by the group Tangerine Dream, created for the American release of the film, is presented here in all of its glory on an isolated track. Though being a fan of the Jerry Goldsmith score myself, I am glad that Tangerine Dream was showcased on this set for the sake of their many fans. After all, the only soundtrack currently available these days is the original score by Jerry, so spotlighting Tangerine Dream on the DVD makes good sense! <br />The documentary &quot;Creating A Myth: The Making Of LEGEND&quot; is very informative and details everything from the creation of the massive forest set to the big fire that completely destroyed the infamous 007 soundstage on which it was built. Ridley Scott, Mia Sara, and many others are available for an interesting hours worth of memories about the film. The inspiration for the film is discussed, as well as the critical reaction and subsequent changes that were ultimately made. Find out why the director made all of the last minute alterations to the film before releasing it in America right here in this documentary! Writer William Hjortsberg vividly recounts his early meetings with Ridley and details some of the hilariously absurd \\"brainstorm\\" ideas that he would occasionally throw into the mix. Altogether, very entertaining! <br />Included with these nifty bonuses are some very neat storyboards of sequences that did not ever make it before the camera, including one that features the heroes encountering a giant in his home. The long lost fairy dance extended sequenceis also recreated here using the music composed by Jerry Goldsmith, as well as the surviving audio track of the filmed sequence, and completed visually with rare photos and artwork from the storyboards. Also included is an alternate opening for the film featuring a fourth goblin that was thought to be lost for many years! It is very interesting to see what may have been as opposed to seeing what actually came to be! <br />Rounding out the bonus features are the more typical offerings common on many DVDs, from the Brian Ferry music video to the theatrical trailers and Cast Bios. All in all, this DVD offers interesting bonuses that are both intriguing and insightful. Coupled together with the awesome presentation of both versions of the film, I don't think that you will be disappointed!
B00012QM8G|2.0|Loved the movie. I've been waiting a long time for this DVD. <br />BUT!<br />The DVD package is horrible. Very cheap &quot;folder like&quot; packaging. The little manual that comes with the DVD keeps falling out. AND the dvd is a flipper! Side A contains the half the movie, side B contains the rest of the movie with worthless bonus material! <br />I am very dissappointed.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|This is just like a great pop video, lots of special effects and cool looking characters - but promoting a really lousy song.<br />Costumes are great, settings are very gothic, the technology is really cool (they heavily borrow here from the TV series Ultraviolet).  The idea seems good, Vampires Vs Werewolves.  I was expecting the best of Blade Meets an American Werewolf in Paris.  But unfortunately this was not to be.<br />This film is like the guy who was oh so cool in high school, with the shades and the black leather jacket, looking sultry as he smoked cigarettes on his motor bike.  But then you meet him when you are 30 and he is still looking cool, but he works stacking shelves in K-Mart!!!!!  It looks great on the outside, but there is no substance.<br />This film has no particular plot - that was lost to special effects and cool scenes.  This film has no characters that you care about, either to love or to hate.  This film is an empty vessel!  It is bad, bad, bad.  And it isn't even funny bad, because it is trying sooooo hard to be sooooo Cool!  And that makes it Sad.  So it is sad and bad, or bad and sad.  Whichever!
B0001EFTVA|5.0|This is the kind of animated feature that puts the vast majority of live-action--and especially big-budget--movies to shame.  There is little in this glowing, passionate story about three of Tokyo's homeless finding a baby on a trash heap one New Year's Eve that couldn't be done on film.  But God is in the details, and as animation it pushes the boundaries of kitchen-sink reality outwards to make the film's themes that much bolder, broader, funnier and meaningful.  Beautifully-drawn characters, deeply-felt themes of love and truth, superb performances (even with the subtitles), and melt-in-your-mouth animation show why Kon is considered to be a master of the craft.
0688091717|5.0|I have been reading this to my baby since he was 2 months old (now 6 months).  It is a bit long for a baby book but he still sits thru and likes hearing the story and looking at the illustrations (surprising considering my little one is antsy).  This book has wonderful photos and a good story- mainly about accepting and embracing your differences.  Elmer the elephant is patchwork, unlike the others who are grey, and feels like he doesnot belong but by the end he learns that his differences are part of the great thing about him.  <br />One thing that does bother me a bit is that Elmer is the 'class clown' so to say & am not sure if this teaches kids that if they are different they have to be a clown and act up??  <br />But overall I do love this book & am glad it teaches to embrace our differences and that we don't have to conform & to accept people for who they are :)  I think this book will continue to capture my child's attention for years to come!
B00006FDCD|4.0|This is a great Stephen King adaptation.  You rarely find movies thta were made for t.v. as good as this one.  But why rate it PG.  It should be PG-13.  Now people are saying how do you know it's rated PG.  It's not rated.  Well I'm going by the Canadian rating since I don't think there should be movies that are Not Rated.  Anyway, we were pretty lucky to get a commentary to go with this movie because it's a t.v. realese, but we do anyway.  The commentary is quite good and entertaining to listen to.  They talk alot about the movie and what it was like filming that part.  My favorite part out of the whole movie is the part where Becky is in the bathroom.  I don't want to gine it away for all the people who haven't seen it yet.  Even thou this is a good movie, I think people should rent it first just to make sure they do like it.  I didn't rent it first and I didn't want to.  I got this for a gift.  So, this movie is great and is a movie for anyone of the fan of the genre.  I highly recomend picking this up or ordering it.<BR>8/10<BR>Rated PG for violence, grusome images, mild language and gore.
B0000E6I1J|4.0|I really enjoyed these CDs and the concert which was recently televised on PBS.  Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and almost everyone gave fine performances.  I was especially impressed with the way Billy Preston belted out his lead vocals.  Joe Brown's (no I never heard of him before) were also a highlight to me.<br />I was rather disappointed with Tom Petty.  Frankly, the last couple of times I heard him perform tell me that he's losing his voice fast.  Never exactly a classic voice, but it used to be a great rock 'n roll voice and seems to be disintegrating into an annoying whine.<br />To me, being a huge Beatles fan, the highlight was Paul McCartney.  Personally, while the duet with Clapton was certainly entertaining, I'd like to hear what Paul could do with &quot;Something&quot; on his own, sung in the way it was originally recorded by George.  The ukelele version that Paul has been doing is touching, but I bet he could solo this tune really well in it's original format.  Has there ever been a better voice in pop music?  I think the best performace on these CDs was Paul's spot-on perfect cover of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.  Just terrific.<br />As to the critics complaining that Paul was on stage last, Paul was preening, Paul made inappropriate comments, etc, etc.  Get over it!  Not unlike John and Paul, Paul and George had their issues between them, but through it all they were friends.  Not long before his death, George used one of Paul's homes in America as a refuge from the prying media.  As for the supposedly &quot;inappropriate joke&quot; Paul made, he was only referring to something that Olivia had said earlier.  Paul was also the picture of dignity on stage that night.<br />He was the last performer introduced.  That was chosen by Dhani and Olivia.  And why not?  He was George's bandmate and the living person mostly closely associated with George in the public's mind.  He got the biggest ovation of any performer that night, which was predictable and therefore appropriate that he be last, so as not to detract from those who would have followed him.  This is why Paul has often been chosen to close shows, such as Live Aid, Prince's Trust, Knebworth.  Face it you Paul bashers, McCartney is as talented a performer as any in the history of rock music and towers over nearly everyone in stature.
B00005JM0B|1.0|This movie is pretty atrocious.  The wuss they dredged up to be John Conner ought to actually be shot by a terminator.  The sharp, wannabe-machine-like motions need to stop.  The woman-terminator thing was idiotic, given it's just a pathetic gimmick and the fact that it wasn't intimidating at all.  The technological advances of the T-300,000,000 or whatever it was were not amply described or developed, not to mention the moronic little concept to have nanomachines control cars is just plain boring; we've seen all that nonsense before.  The plot was actually decent i daresay, but was mostly botched due to the absolutely relentless pace of the movie.<br />On top of all this, i just got the sensation while watching it that the subject wasn't being dealt with seriously, nor was i as an audience member.  The clever little surprise ending also was incredibly weak, given what could have been done with it.  The movie seemed like a 1st graders art collage, with a thousand different pointless things glued on with no rhyme or reason, and in the end leaving an ugly, haphazard mess.<br />My favorite two scenes were these: 1) the bathroom fight-scene, which was really stupid, but, i hesitate to admit, also funny as hell 2) a scene in the mobile home where claire danes gives an absolutely gorgeous smile.  And i think that says it all.  This is an action movie, yet my favorite scene was just that because of a woman smiling.  You just gotta do better than that.  Thanks, whatever nobody directed this, for taking a serious, and compelling subject and reducing it to more hollywood moneygrubbing tripe bloated with special effects but destitute of substance and impoverished of human emotion of any kind.  The thing that made Terminator and Terminator 2 so good was that they weren't composed solely of fluff, but they had a message, and it was carried through an excellent medium.  Where those two movies both riled our hearts with excitement and touched them with a sense of empathy and concern, this one does neither, and leaves us feeling empty.
B000065PUE|4.0|After 1988's brilliant but abrasive Surfer Rosa, the Pixies' sound couldn't get much more extreme. Their Elektra debut, Doolittle, reins in the noise in favor of pop songcraft and accessibility. Producer Gil Norton's sonic sheen adds some polish, but Black Francis' tighter songwriting focuses the group's attack. Doolittle's most ferocious moments, like &quot;Dead,&quot; a visceral retelling of David and Bathsheba's affair -- are more stylized than the group's past outbursts.  Meanwhile, their poppy side surfaces on the irresistible single &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; and the sweetly surreal love song &quot;La La Love You.&quot; The Pixies' arty, noisy weirdness mix with just enough hooks to produce gleefully demented singles like &quot;Debaser,&quot; -- inspired by Bunuel's classic surrealist short Un Chien Andalou -- and &quot;Wave of Mutilation,&quot; their surfy ode to driving a car into the sea. Though Doolittle's sound is cleaner and smoother than the Pixies' earlier albums, there are still plenty of weird, abrasive vignettes: the blankly psychotic &quot;There Goes My Gun,&quot; &quot;Crackity Jones,&quot; a song about a crazy roommate Francis had in Puerto Rico, and the nihilistic finale &quot;Gouge Away.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Tame,&quot; and &quot;I Bleed&quot; continue the Pixies' penchant for cryptic kink. But the album doesn't just refine the Pixies' sound; they also expand their range on the brooding, wannabe spaghetti western theme &quot;Silver&quot; and the strangely theatrical &quot;Mr. Grieves.&quot; &quot;Hey&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven,&quot; on the other hand, stretch Francis' lyrical horizons: &quot;Monkey&quot;'s elliptical environmentalism and &quot;Hey&quot;'s twisted longing are the Pixies' versions of message songs and romantic ballads. Their most accessible album, Doolittle's wide-ranging moods and sounds make it one of their most eclectic and ambitious. A fun, freaky alternative to most other late-'80s college rock, it's easy to see why the album made the Pixies into underground rock stars. -- Heather P.<br />&quot;The Nevermind of the 80's!&quot; [...]to see why the album made the Pixies into underground rock stars. -- Heather P.<br />&quot;The Nevermind of the 80's!&quot; [...]

B0001AVZA8|1.0|Wow....I was so excited when the movie started...after the dancing harveys, but then it died.  And died.  And died again.  To the point where I wished that a carachtar would die so it would end.  If only this movie had had a plot....like 12 storylines that don't meet in the middle.  If it had been bad, I could have left in the beginning and gotten 2 hours of my life back.  The worst thing since \\"It's Pat-The Movie\\".  YUK!!
B0000CFW87|1.0|Another one of these guys?Another tenor broadway type guy I don't mean to sterotype ,but come on when are you people going to learn that these kind of easy listening DWOBS and yes I said DWOBS are going to take over the airwaves and then we will be living in Babylon5.Don't buy this junk I've heard it just to show that I can be open minded and now I know that when this trash comes on the radio to close my mind.
B0001AP12G|3.0|Release Date: February 10, 2004 <br />The College Dropout <BR>Record Label: Roc-A-Fella <br />1. Intro (0:19) <br />2. We Don't Care (3:59) <BR>Well, I have different opinions with &quot;We Don't Care&quot;. It's a good song, don't get me wrong, but it is kind of kiddy-ish. Although, it is a nice track and a good one to start off an album. It is in the running for the best track on the CD. 9/10 <br />3. Graduation Day (1:22) <br />4. All Falls Down (3:43) <BR>One thing comes to mind when I hear Lauryn Hill: NINABoy1127. LOL man. Well, it is a tight track, almost anything with Hill is, seriously. 8.5/10 <br />5. Ill Fly Away (1:09) <br />6. Spaceship feat. GLC &amp; Consequence (5:24) <BR>Well, definately tight lyrics, a good track, yet, the best is a different story. I don't like the beat, too hard for the soft lyrics. Overall an average track. 8/10 <br />7. Jesus Walks (3:13) <BR>Not the best track, but definately not a bad one. Just average, just average. 8/10 <br />8. Never Let Me Down (5:24) <BR>A very good track, a plus to follow an average track. &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; is one track that I like listening to. Probably a top track for the CD. 8.5/10 <br />9. Get Em High (4:49) <BR>Yet again another good track, I really like this. It has the right beat with the right lyrics. 9/10 <br />10. Workout Plan (0:46) <br />11. The New Workout Plan (5:22) <BR>A fiddle? Are you kidding me? Oh, well, it has the lyrics and idea to make it a good track, one of the better ones. I like the idea that Kanye has a workout plan and these people comment on it in the song. Good! 9/10 <br />12. Slo Jamz feat. Twista (5:16) <BR>Okay, here is maybe the best song on the album. I've liked it ever since it came out, definately in the running for the best track. 10/10 <br />13. Breathe In Breathe Out (4:16) <BR>&quot;Breathe In Breathe Out&quot; has, to me, the lyrics and beat mix as &quot;Stand Up&quot; by Ludacris. Even though I like &quot;Stand Up&quot; better, &quot;Breathe In Breate Out&quot; is not that bad. 7.5/10 <br />14. School Spirit Skit #1 (1:18) <br />15. School Spirit (3:02) <BR>Not the best, not the worst, an average. It is okay, though, just gets a little annoying sometimes. 7.5/10 <br />16. School Spirit Skit #2 (0:43) <br />17. Lil Jimmy Skit (0:53) <br />18. Two Words (4:26) <BR>Another average track, but this is a little better-than-average. I wouldn't like to listen to this as much as some tracks, bit it's not bad. 8/10 <br />19. Through The Wire (3:41) <BR>How can you not like &quot;Through The Wire&quot;? I mean, he recorded it while his jaw was wired shut! Plus it was his first hit. Definately a really nice track, one of the best. 9.5/10 <br />20. Family Business (4:38) <BR>You know, &quot;College Dropout&quot; is like a story. It starts kiddy-ish, gets harder, than gets soft. Here is a really nice example of a song you can listen to in most any mood. A definate good track, one of the best. 9/10 <br />21. Last Call (12:40) <BR>Once again, one of the best tracks. A definate good thing that he ended his debut album with a tight song. 9.5/10 <br />Total Points: 121/140 <BR>Final Grade: 86% (C) <BR>Final Notes: For a debut album, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; is really good. A definate plus for Kanye. There is too many skits, however, but enough tracks to make up for it. <br />Best Track Race: <BR>1. Slo Jamz <BR>2. We Don't Care <BR>3. Through The Wire <BR>4. Family Business <BR>5. Last Call <br />Worst Track Race: <BR>1. School Spirit <BR>2. Breathe In Breathe Out <BR>3. Jesus Walks <BR>4. Spaceship <BR>5. Two Words
B0000027RL|5.0|I love this album how could anyone not like this?The later albums were not good,but this album really stands the test of time I really wasn't into this type of music when it first came out but now that I hear stuff like this well it rocks.
B00003CX97|4.0|I just saw this for the first time a few weeks ago.  I was very, very impressed - though I did not anticipate it.  For the first 15-20 minutes it kept looking to me like I was supposed to think of Alec Guiness as the hero of this film.  After all, his men cheered for him and the patriotic music was playing for many of his scenes.  But I heartily disagree with his character's convictions: officers will be exempt from manual (or enlisted) labors.  In other words, the enlisted men would build the enemy's bridge while the officers stood by and watched (or supervised).  Only one word comes to mind: Treason.  I was glad to see this was not the case and that the screenplay writers had other things in mind.<br />I have heard that this movie contains virtually no historical accuracy and that it has been criticized by the men who were actually involved in this particular incident.  I can respect that.  But it does not keep me from enjoying this movie.  I think few people would watch this film, witness the colonel's attitudes toward the POW camp commander, and not think, &quot;Surely, if this was real life, this man would be killed on the spot for what he is saying and doing.&quot;  (Remember, most of the time Hollywood can't even successfully bring a fictional novel to the screen without butchering it.)<br />Another movie I have a deep respect for is Steven Spielberg's AMISTAD, which has also been reported as having numerous historical errors.  Other films/shows which are based on true stories but contain historical inaccuracies (some to a lesser degree than others) include SCHINDLER'S LIST, BRAVEHEART, MAN ON THE MOON, SHADOWLANDS, television's LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, and just about anything from Oliver Stone.<br />It's always good to remember that Hollywood's primary purpose is to entertain.  For education, books and documentaries (preferably those not put together by the Hollywood elite) are still the best (and most satisfying) ways to learn.
1881273156|5.0|My Fiance now back to b/f are finding out our Love language. Our arguements are so ugly we don't see the light at the end of the tunnel which we should supposedly be engaged. For the last 7 mos I was trying to convey to him what my needs were to feel loved, but I only brought nagging and making him feel he's not loving.  How could I express to him without him feeling attacked? I picked this book up thinking I'll just thumb through it, I could not put it down. It nailed us to a tee! I read from cover to cover and encourage my b/f to read it. He told me his love language is words of affirmation / acts of service. I feel Receiving Gifts / Quality time is mine. Knowing this helps us to understand, grow and to love. One day at a time. <BR>There are many books about relationships but I believe this book is pure simplicity.
1577311523|5.0|I've noticed that some criticize Tolle for &quot;expanding&quot; the book or making it too long. But as Tolle himself notes, the book is written in a Q&amp;A format where he tries to answer the same questions from different perspectives. Tolle also points out that the basic premise is not complicated, it just takes focus and practice. Others criticize Tolle for the impossible task of translating a mystical experience with words. Well, how else was he supposed to do it? Are there &quot;mystical&quot; media channels out there he should be communicating through?<br />I have read endless numbers of books on finding oneself, reaching enlightenment, and so on, and none have rung true like Tolle's book. I have given it to many friends as a gift and only one found it difficult to grasp, the rest were deeply moved. But don't listen to me or others, check it out at the library, listen to it or read it and judge for yourself. As Tolle notes, he isn't &quot;teaching&quot; you anything - he's reminding you what you already know. Give it a try - it may indeed change your life.
B0000C1733|5.0|This is by far the best greatest hits album in history, many Red Hot Chilli Peppers fans would say that this album did not include enough of thier greatest hits.I think that it was a perfect selection of variety showing thier many different vibes.I have not heard enough greatest hits albums like this one, and I esp. like one of thier new songs Save The Population which includes backround vocals by John Frusciante.I also really like the sound of the other new track Fortune Faded which has not been (in my opinion) played enough on the radio and if it had would and could very well have mde it to #1 because of the perfect beat and mind blowing video.I still love classic Peppers songs like Under The Bridge and Give it Away.I say you donnot have any appreciation or good taste in music at all if you donnot pick up this cd as soon as possible , and further more I think you should pick up a second and give it to someone who hasn't really been exposed to this type of great music.
B00009RDG9|3.0|I thought this movie to be a little better than what some of the other reviewers said. However, it does have some weak points. I give it credit for its action sequences, but little credit for dialogue which was the film's great weakness. I must agree with another reviewer who said this film is a hybrid cross between THE FUGITIVE and FIRST BLOOD (RAMBO 1). If you've seen these two films, then you've likely seen almost everything that THE HUNTED has to offer. <br />The only difference is this film's emphasis on knife fighting, which does make this movie a bit interesting. Some it is quite phoney though. If you know anything about knife making, you know it requires a blacksmith's technique and several days worth of effort in order to craft a truly functional blade with a modern design. One of our stars accomplishes this trick by fashioning a knife out of a hunk of scrap metal over a simple campfire ... in what appears to be a rather brief period. The finished knife was an exceptionally well-stylized pattern complete with a serrated edge. I couldn't stop laughing! <br />This movie is not as good as First Blood or The Fugitive, but if you like knife-fighting action you might enjoy this film.
B000002H2Z|5.0|Back in my goth days of the late 1980's I kinda scorned this album, I loved The Cure of course but thought that this was just a bit too poppy and chirpy for it's own good. Hearing it again, after many years, I was blown away by how well this has stood the test of time, perhaps better than any other of Robbie Smith's offerings. <br />From start to finish this album bounces and rocks through many different styles and influences and colours, though maintains it's 'Cureness' through Smith's deliciously crazy lyrics, his definitive, angular guitar work and instantly recognizable voice.<br />I would have to say in hindsight the sonwriting on this album is better than any other Cure album. There is just not one bad moment on all 10 tracks. The angst of earlier (and later) releases is still there, it's just less relentless, and expressed in a wider tapestry of musical references.<br />People always associate The Cure with doom and gloom - they were always much more than that. They are one of the most interesting, eccentric and unique bands of that emerged in the 80's and Robert Smith is about the only guy who looks good in lipstick and eyeliner.
B00009ATKS|5.0|As I descend further and further into the bottomless hole that is music, I continue to unearth new and exciting artists the likes of which I could have never imagined existed.  Mogawi is one of my finest discoveries yet, an amazing band that have the rare ability to craft beautiful songs that sound fresh and stimulate happiness.<br />Happy Songs for Happy People is my introduction to Mogwai, and what a first impression it has made upon me.  For weeks I have stayed up late nights listening to this CD, totally entranced by its beauty.  Happy Songs is a beautiful some what instrumental post-rock album with a very mellow and relaxed feel.  melodies and guitar float in the air while solid percussion and string arrangments keep things grounded while exploring new heights at the same time.  Listening to this album feels like cool autumn nights, my best dreams, and butterflies in my stomach all in one.  <br />As cliche as it sounds, I can't describe the album in words, nor can I describe its beauty.  See other reviews for detailed descriptions of Mogwais sound or songs on this album.  I can't say any more than that this is a beautiful album, but that's really all that needs to be said.  <br />Review in a nutshell:  Happy Songs for Happy People is a lush, full musical experience that I can not get enough of.
B0000844IT|5.0|One thing that makes this movie great is that the writing/plot/acting are all pretty good, nothing special, but good, what makes it great is that the director purposefully used less money than they could have. wich becomes increasingly obvious throughout the movie.<BR>a true cult classic and possibly one of the best comidies ever made.<BR>(if you are looking for a horror movie that's like the first 2 evil deads, than by all means stay away, but if you are looking for a good laugh than look no further.)
1573229725|5.0|I haven't finished reading this book yet, but I LOVE it! It is full of unexpected twists and suspence. I have bought the other 2 novels by the same author and I can't wait to read them.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think this album is fabulous.  It's such a change from what we are used to from Britney.  It shows how much she has grown up.  The music is definately more adult oriented and definately not for kids.  She's not trying to be a role model anymore, she's just trying to be herself.  That's what her whole hiadus was about, She's reinvented herself and done a fab job at it at that.  She's not trying to be that cute little innocent girl anymore.  Each of the songs has a different feel to it and shows her variety as an entertainer and writer.  The whole album is catchy and great for just chilling out and listening to.  I highly reccommend it, but for the  18+ crowd!
0679411585|5.0|Joe Galloway and Hal Moore have written a wonderful book.  Anyone remotely interested in military history should read it.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I feel like I have always subconsciously been a Moby fan even though I neglected to buy one of his CDs until just now. I don't really know what kept me away for so long, to tell anyone who cares the truth, because his music is so refreshing. Well, I dare not forget to mention that his music has been the background for so many of those intense, climatic (and countless) moments in television dramas and Adidas commercials. But...I have always been a sucker for great song placement, so here I am praising this record.<br />To actually talk about `Play' now, I must say that it is truly an exceptional record in all respects. I feel like it has a little bit of everything---hypnotizing instrumentals, haunting vocal hooks, and superior dance grooves (did I really just use that word?)---that even a casual listener can be moved by. This album is truly a must-have for anyone's collection.<br />I know that Moby is mostly labeled in the \\"techno\\" realm--- for good reason of course, because well, let's face it...he's not much of a rapper---but I think \\"techno\\" can be a harsh word. It automatically throws you into a category with club DJs and mind numbing, repetitive bass thuds. I think Moby's tracks have much more depth than the word \\"techno\\" can imply. There is something almost inspirational or even enigmatic about songs like \\"Porcelain\\" and \\"Why does my heart feel so bad?\\" Others, like \\"Honey\\" and \\"Run on\\" are pretty darn fun. \\"Bodyrock\\", of course, is a classic I-want-to-play-any-sport-in-slow-motion-to-it song...but I really didn't need to tell anyone that. \\"Natural Blues\\" is creepily beautiful, while \\"The Sky is broken\\" is just creepy...I love `em. \\"Guitar flute &amp; string\\" is just that...if this song is techno, I can't seem to find a beat to shake it like a Polaroid picture to-it's very innovative.<br />All in all, I found `Play' to be a perfect record. Plus...as a definite bonus, it sounds GREAT in the car.  Okay, I'm done.<br />P.S. I am also an Eminem fan...I'm just saying.ying.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|I was really hyped up for this wrestle mania. I was looking forward to the Goldberg vs. Lesnar match. I thought the whole night will be worth watching.<br />The first match was pretty good considering it at The Big Show. (a.k.a. The Big Slow) John Cena did a good job to quicken the pace and win the match. This match was entertaining and I thought the matches will get better as the night rolled along.<br />The rest of the matches where boring. The only reason the next match was worth watching was the performance of RVD. The Fatal Four way was just an Okay match.<br />The Christan vs. Jericho was good enough to watch at a regular Raw show but the ending made it all worth it. <br />Evolution vs. the Rock n' Sock connection was a pretty entertaining match. Randy Orton proved why he is the legend killer. Look out for Orton he could be head liner for the next Wrestlemania.<br />Sable/Torrie vs. Stacy/Jackie (who is not attractive) Stacy is my favorite diva and to see all the divas fight in their under wear made the match special. I just hoped the match was longer.<br />The Cruiserweight open was pretty good. Billy Kidman and Rey put on a great show. The Ultimamo Dragon got elimated pretty fast, which is too bad because I would have liked to see him face off against Rey or Kidman. But Chavo won again. GO CHAVO!!!<br />Goldberg vs. Lesnar was probably the biggest disapointment in WWE history. I wanted this match to happen ever since Goldberg came back, but both of these WWE Stars gave the worst performance of thier careers. Stone Cold stunned both of them simpily because the crowd was disapointed and the match took the life out of the fans watching. I'm a big Goldberg fan and to hear the New York crowd chant \\"Goldberg sucks\\" I understood because they deserved a good match. I hope this match does not tarnish the career of Goldberg in the WWE. <br />The Fatal Four for the Smackdown Tag Team title was really weak. The only good part was the end of the match when Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty put on a dance show for the fans. <br />Victoria vs. Molly I was looking foward to see a good performance by Victoria but I was disapointed again. Molly got her head shaved and she looks pretty good. <br />Eddie vs. Kurt Angle Now I thought this match didn't even deserve to be a title match but I was wrong. This was a good match and Eddie lied, cheated, stoled his way to victory. A very surprising good match.<br />Kane vs. the Undertaker Now what was up with this new Undertaker...I was aspecting something like the old Undertaker. He looked nasty. The undertaker did put a good performance but wasn't one of Kane's and Undertaker's best matches.<br />HHH vs. HBK vs. Chris Benoit Now I thought this match whould have been the weakest match of the night but I was wrong. This match goes down as one of the best matches I have seen in a while. HBk gave a great performance, HHH proved why he is the Game, and Chris Benoit proved why he deserves to be champ. <br />Overall if you where to buy this DVD get it because of the triple treat match, Eddie vs. Kurt Angle, John Cena winning the US title, the playboy match, and the return of the Undertaker.
B000089RVX|2.0|No big deal, no great innovation as people keep saying... this is a blend between nu-metal and gothic, and its really boring.
B00005JLWN|5.0|A very respectable blend of 1984, Metropolis and Fahrenheit 451.<br />This movie has combined what has always been missing in action films. Intense action, deep characters and a plot that actually makes us feel.<br />Why can't action movies have heart and why can't heart have action?<br />Christian Bale is outstanding. A charcter that must not reveal his emotions to all (except the audience). He does very little and he does it so well we're moved to tears.<br />Please see this movie.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This is an excellent movie! It makes you laugh. It makes you cry. Hugh Grant's dance is hilarious and the couples and the lengths they go to are heartwarming. I recommend it for anyone, but not appropriate for kids because of some innappropriate scenes.
B0000025ZK|4.0|David Gilmour's magnificent guitar talent and stylings make this album special. This was recorded in a period where he was not having fun anymore with Pink Floyd as he did an \\"About Face\\" with the tracks here showing him having a good time again. Sounding definitely Floyd-like throughout, there are a bunch of standout cuts especially the superb ballad, \\"Out Of The Blue\\". Bob Ezrin shared with Gilmour in producing this album as all 10 tracks included flow very nicely. If you enjoy Floyd, you will enjoy this CD.
B0000399WI|5.0|Yes, as my title says, it IS the best movie ever made to me. Not one of the best... but its THE best. I got trully engaged into this movie. If u haven't seen this one movie yet, go buy one. Don't just rent it or download it... but BUY it. becuz I promise that you will not regret owning it.
B000000WJZ|3.0|I disagre with the people who say Siamese Dream is the best Pumpkins album (that honor goes to Mellon Collie &amp; the Infinte Sadness and y'all know it). Firstly, because every single instrument on SD is played by Billy Corgan desite the fact Jimmy, D'Arcy, and James were listed in the liner notes It's more of a Billy Corgan album than anything else. To quote a previous reviewer: &quot;Jimmmy Chamberlain's drumming is quite simply mindblowing. Arguably the best rock/jazz incorporated style drumming in the music business other than Dave Grohl&quot;. Wow, Billy's that good?! Billy and plenty of others out there<BR>must be proud to know their better than David Grohl. Secondly, there were only several memorable tunes for me. Disarm, Cherub Rock, Today, and Sweet Sweet are the only ones I can honestly remember after haing listened to just three weeks ago for the tenth time. It's a shame Sweet Sweet didn't even seem to have a chorus or length of a real song; it could've been a single! Despite the loads of unmemorable tunes, I do remember that said songs weren't anything I didn't like, but like I said, what I enjoyed about them I cannot remember. <br />My rating: 3.5 out of 5.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West - The College Dropout (Roc-a-fella, 2004)<br />All the talk about Jay-Z being all that the Roc's got can finally be squashed. The Midwest's own Kanye West finally drops his heavily bootlegged (but now reworked) album, The College Dropout.<br />You've read all of the reviews; they're significantly split down the middle (&quot;The greatest rap album this year!&quot; vs. &quot;The worst album of the year!&quot;). Well, it may not be the greatest (damn, the year just started), but it is a really good album. The album starts with a Bernie Mac impersonator telling Kanye to kick it for the children, only to diss him after that song (&quot;We Don't Care&quot;) is over. That song has a sped-up sample of the most overplayed song in America, &quot;I Just Wanna Stop&quot;, but the sped-up function of it makes the song more interesting.<br />If you've listened to West's past productions, you would think that this album would be full of that sped-up soul samples and would want to steer clear before it becomes overkill. But the good news is that not every song is like that, for example, &quot;All Falls Down&quot; (featuring Syleena Johnson; well, actually, it's her singing two lines being repeated over and over again). Also, unless you've been living under a rock, you heard &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; and &quot;Through the Wire&quot; and you know that West can rap. Though his delivery needs a little more work, he makes up for that with heartfelt, funny, and real lyrics. There are too many lyrics to quote, but for hip-hop fans who only buy albums for lyricism, they'll be in heaven with this album.<br />Song highlights include &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (with Jay-Z--this song sounds like Kweli's &quot;Get By&quot;) and even the long outro where Kanye explains his come-up. And for people who thought that Common fell off after catching Baduizm and dropping Electric Circus can welcome him back to his old self on &quot;Get Em High&quot; (also with Kweli).<br />Unfortunately, there are way too many skits on this album and most of them aren't even funny, especially the &quot;Lil' Jimmy Skit&quot; (I'm a college graduate and I am VERY successful, thank you). Also, &quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out&quot;, &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot;, and &quot;School Spirit&quot; are all mediocre. But this album is still a winner. We're not talking Illmatic, It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, or The Chronic status, but maybe Midnight Marauders status. Meaning that The College Dropout isn't the BEST, just the best compared to everything else out here now. -EJR
B0000DD7LB|1.0|WELL THE LONG RUN THIS CD IS BAD!!!! I MEAN I CAN USE IT AS A COASTER OR A FRISBEE. THE ONLY REASON THAT THE CD CAN SELL IS THAT THE RECORD LABEL MARKETERS ARE REALLY REALLY SMART!!! ALL THEY NEED IS SOME SOUTHERN GIRL THAT CAN'T SING GLAME HER UP PRETEND SHE CAN SING AND THE WAMMO!!!! YOU GOT A POP SENSATION!!! GOOD GRAVY!!! WELL YOU KNOW ONLY PRE PUBESSENT TEENS GO AND BUY THE CD! THATS THE ONLY REASON. I HAD HEARD A SAMPLE AND I WAS HORRIFIED ON HOW HER MUSIC CHANGED, WOH WHATS UP WITH THE YING YANG TWINS? DOES SHE EVEN WRITE HER OWN LYRICS?! I THINK NOT! WOOPTY DOO!  BUT ALL I KNOW IS THAT SHE SHOULD JUST BE A BLONDE LIKE JESSICA SIMPSON AND NOT EVEN SING JUST BE A BEAUTY QUEEN THAT SHE IS.
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones - Feels Like Home (Blue Note, 2004)<br />If you loved Come Away With Me, then you'll love this album too because it's practically the same album, just not without a noticeable hit like \\"Don't Know Why\\". Similar to India.Arie's sophomore album, don't expect a significant growth in Jones's songwriting and performance because it's only been a short time between this album and her last. This album still has highlights aplenty like \\"What Am I To You?\\" and the Dolly Parton duet, \\"Creepin' In\\". Norah Jones has bypassed the sophomore jinx with this one. -EJR
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I guess you &quot;had to be there&quot; for some people.  I was, and this was it.  This movie is not a study on the Japanese people, it just conveys the feeling of confused Americans in a few very foreign situations.  Of course this is all just a backdrop for a great, subtle piece.<br />To those who complain about the lack a plot or humor, just go back to the regular Hollywood junk and put this DVD back on the shelf for those who don't need constant over-stimulation.<br />To me, it was hilarious and touching.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|My kids loved listening to her when she started out, however, since she has been &quot;TRYING TO BE COOL&quot;( as my 10 and 12yr old put it) they CAN't stand her. They are dissapointed in her! She USED to be a role model, well not now. <BR>  The CD is not for kids under 14.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Well the Dark Crystal is one of those films that you either love or you hate, much like Lord of the rings! I have to admit first though that I'm biased in as such as I grew up with this film, it being released the year after I was born. It's just magical, mythical and exciting all at the same time and while it would appeal mostly to the under 10's, I know for a fact it appeals to a much wider audience. <br />The puppets are simply fantastic, so real looking infact and so well played that from the outset you never look upon them as puppets. Instead you'll look upon them as you would any other human actors. A great theme tune and amazing scenery really make this a blockbuster of a puppet movie. <br />I think we all need a bit of the old imaginary, fictionary tales once in a while. In the 80's there was the Dark Crystal, and others of course, and in this decade it would have to be lord of the rings. <br />All in all a great film that will have you glued to your seat to see what happens next in this funny, imaginative and dreamy classic.
B000092Q4U|1.0|I bought this CD because they seemed pretty famous and i wanted to hear what there music was like.  It turns out they suck a lot. The instrumentals are good but repetative but the screaming is what made it suck the most.  If you like listening to bands were a singer with Flem screams non-sense in one note (Kinda like RAP) then this is th CD for You.
B00003CWNR|4.0|I loved this movie a lot, but I wonder what pro-lifers and radical right-wingers thought about it. <br />Tobey McGuire is excellent as the shy, quiet, yet adorable hero named Homer Wells in this movie. He is not as gung-ho on being an abortionist as Dr. Larch (Michael Caine)seems to be in an orphanage/birth/abortion clinic. <br />With very little forethought or explanation Homer decides to leave the only home he has ever known and tag along with a young couple. Candy (Charlize Theron) is about to return to her normal life after having an abortion. Wally is about to leave his normal life for the War. Homer, a pediatrician in every sense but the formal training and credentials, finds paradise in the incredibly simple life of an apple-picker. As such he rubs elbows with and shares a bunkhouse with African-American, illiterate, migrant workers. He falls in a kind of naive, complacent, passive, romantic/sexual love with Candy and gives little mind to how to keep her from getting pregnant again. <br />The issue of incest pops up later but the details would reveal too much to the reader who hasn't yet seen the movie. The ending is not entirely predictable and very pleasant - in a tragi-comedy sort of way. <br />McGuire is absolutely excellent and you really can find nothing to hate about him or his character. Caine is fair in a role that I think others would have excelled at. Theron is amazingly dull and her character would only attract McGuire's character given the latter's relative inexperience with girls/women (except, ironically, in gynecological skill). Kieron Culkin's Buster character pulls at your heart strings and you really get to know Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo) and Rose Rose (Eryka Badu) even though most of the drama between the two occurs elsewhere. <BR>     The movie has its problems. Candy is really not as sexy and loveable as she ought to be. Homer seems to be intellectually gifted yet picks apples for more than a full season without getting bored. He also fails to be assertive as the love of his life drifts away. The screenplay is quite shallow in many ways. For example, Homer is the only character developed in the orphanage scenes, despite the fact of having Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, and several, endearing, child actors as a great supporting cast. At other times the screenplay is brilliant such as all the commentary slid in about abortion as a necessary evil which is at conflict with Homer's respect for life. Yet the bias towards pro-choice and the decriminalization of abortion is obviously too slanted. Likewise the incest issue is treated almost as being a tolerable evil when Homer and everyone else should be outraged by the taboo. I am not sure I can sympathize with a man who cuts another man for throwing a cigarrette butt in the cider yet tells Homer to mind his own business as to the biological father of Rose's unborn child. <BR>  Still despite these problems I have enjoyed wathcing the movie every time (about 5) I have watched it. But then I wonder how more conservative people view it.
B000001ZSF|4.0|This album was from when Jarre made great albums, and not like his latest albums that failed.<BR>The best tracks on the album are 2, 4 and 6, and it requires a great hifi system to enjoy this album.<BR>That same year as Chronologie were released, was Jarre performing one of his best concerts in the same arena in Barcelona in 1993, where the Olympic Games were held the last year.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Heres why Love me do is included on &quot;1&quot; but Please please me was not... Love me do did hit the number 1 spot for 1 week in America in 1964,thus it is here, Please please me hit number 1 on 2 of the 3 charts in England in early 1963,but on the chart that was used to compile this album,it was held at number 2.Thats why.
B00005KHJR|5.0|Don't watch this movie if you're looking for a horror film.<BR>Don't watch it if you're looking for something very serious.<BR>Don't watch it if you get easily annoyed by camp or non-Christian religions.<br />DO watch it if you have an interest in things Pagan.<BR>DO watch it if you like campy movies.<BR>DO watch it if you like Christopher Lee.<br />This movie is not a horror movie. The camp is too much for it to really frighten anyone. It is, however, a delightful film. I won't say that the acting is of high quality except for the cases of Christopher Lee (charming) and Edward Woodward (self-righteous). It's a bad movie, let's be honest. But it is one of those rare bad movies that has a charm all its own, hence its cult status. I've heard people complain that Woodward's character is totally lacking in sympathy. I sort of feel like that's the point. It's ok to empathize with the &quot;bad guys&quot; instead. If you've seen Ian McKellen play Richard III on film, you adore that evil manipulative tyrant. Same thing here. I found myself falling in love with this idyllic little Pagan utopia, where kids are taught about the Maypole's phallic symbolism, men and women make love in the fields, and the guy in charge wears a kilt...except for the small fact that they have this nasty little habit of human sacrifice.<BR>Not everyone will like the movie. In fact, it's sort of a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; flick. If you enjoy a good bad movie and are interested in Paganism, this will be a delight. If you prefer serious films and don't give a fig about the old religion, well, it's probably not for you.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|On the surface, this is a cautionary drug tale right out of the 1930s: \\"Behold, ladies and gentlemen, as four ordinary citizens, not unlike yourselves, descend into the dark underworld of dangerous and evil narcotics and go mad, mad, MAD!\\"<br />But no cliché could affect you this deeply, and that's because this film is less about drugs than the voids they can't fill. Unlike most films of this ilk, which end either a ridiculous orgy of Uzi fire or worse, with a group improbably beautiful junkies decked out in $17,000 of Prada hopping into their mint '63 Lincoln and driving off into a VU-soundtracked desert sunset, Requiem ends at the bottom of the spiral, empty lives fueled with prescription hope colliding head-on with cold, final reality.<br />And that's why it breaks your heart. These aren't bad people, these aren't players, they're just souls seeking light where there is none. Our director does an amazing job of capturing their rituals of addiction, how they substitute the safety of habit for the daunting task of confronting their fears and disappointments, and how it all falls apart when that eggshell world finally shatters.<br />The last 10 minutes of this movie may be the most gut-wrenching cinema I've ever seen; it may be fiction, but you can't leave this behind when the credits roll. Brutal, cutting, but endlessly rewarding.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Loved this movie because it is about honestly,loyality and non judgement.People who don't get this movie i guess feel those ideals are too high but in a life time they are the only things that can really count.So do yourself a favour and drop the ego and enjoy the masterful fantasy that is Forest Gump.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Peter Sellers: One messed up individual. a man with a personality so erratic it could be Michael Bay's movie career. and yet, when this personality is put in front of a camera, or in the case of Dr. Strangelove, several personalities, he shines like a needle full of Novocaine.<br />The great man's performance in three key roles in the movie is fantastic, and above all, hilarious. slim pickens and sterling hayden provide some nice support and the famous bomb riding scene is more than enough reason for watching this movie. but, as with peter sellers' personality, it is not the only one.<br />There is a subtext in Kubricks comedy that reflects the current political situation, especially in the country it is set in. between gun happy, commie hating senators and covered up pie fighting scenes, this movie could be held up to a current CNN bulletin and almost be the same: accurate, relevant, and laugh out loud hilarious. watch this, stop worrying, and learn to love the Peter Sellers
0066214122|4.0|Researchers at a remote facility in the Nevada desert have been working on defense and medical applications using nanotechnology - microscopic robots used to perform various functions.  Jack Forman, a recently unemployed computer programmer specializing in using predator/prey relationships to optimize computer applications, has been asked to help debug some problems.  The opportunity is good for Jack because his wife works for the company on the same project, although her behavior has been very strange lately.  He suspects she is having an affair with a coworker.  What he discovers, however, is that the experiment has gotten loose and created a self-sustaining, self-replicating swarm of nano-bots that attack and kill in seconds.<br />In my opinion, this is one of Michael Crichton's best novels - on a level with Jurassic Park or Andromeda Strain.  What makes it especially frightening is the introduction (do NOT skip the intro) where he explains that the scenario is real and possible - a confluence of computer technology, bioengineering, and nanotechnology - and experts have begun to warn of potential disasters in the next 50 to 100 years.  Then a short half-page narrative right before chapter one, obviously from a time later in the story, helps to set a tone that makes it difficult to put the book down.  In all honesty, my ONLY complaint was the liberal use of the &quot;F&quot; word.<br />Although the technology is very complicated, Mr. Crichton does a good job of explaining it - not that I understood it well, but enough to follow the plot.  In all a very enjoyable and scary story that I wanted to keep reading to the conclusion.
0385474547|4.0|Achebe wrote this book following the release of 'Heart of Darkness', though this meant nothing to me as I had to read this following a piece of due AS level coursework!<br />When I started it, I deplored Achebe's use of language, and the entire 'story-telling' kind of writing he was aiming for.<br />However, when I came to analyse the book in closer detail, I learned how cleverly he actually has used cultural metaphors, an interesting turn of phrase when writing, and a style which sets it apart from many of its contemporaries.<br />When I learnt this, I decided to re-read the book, and found it far more enjoyable, being able to appreciate what made it such a good book without having such a closed mind.<br />This book is good...as I've said, if you have the time. Time to study and time to try and understand what direction and perspective he is writing from. If you do indeed undertake this task, it is a very worthwhile read and well worth your time. If however, you are looking for a book which you need not think too hard about, merely enjoy, I think you would be better looking off elsewhere
B0001611DI|5.0|If you are fiending for Dawn of the Dead and have seen the going price for the few remaining DVD versions out there, get this DVD now.  You will bask in the relaxing aura of late 70's synthesizer soundscapes, marvel at the strangely committed performances of the well-chosen cast, and be blown away by the shocking violence of Savini's creative, kaleidoscopic kills.

B000002N2N|5.0|I like the ramones alright, but this album takes the cake. I found it in the recently traded bin at a local music shop and leapt at it. I flew home with my freakin speakers about to burst.
B000069HKH|3.0|Let me start by saying Born in the USA was the first album I had - a battered and recorded tape, and this is why Bruce will always be rated high in my list, though not for cds like The Rising. It's way too focused on 9/11 and gets tiresome after a while. Some songs are too long for their own good and there are some throaways as well (Let's be friends, anyone?). By the time you get to the song Paradise you may feel like hitting the stop button.<br />The addiction of a violin in many of the songs is not a bad idea, despite what other users have said, but then again the sound is at times too dense. True that Sunny Day and Miracle do sound pretty alike. My favorite songs are especially the title track and Further On Up The Road, and the ones I don't enjoy, besides the last two songs (Too depressive for me) are Let's be Friends and Worlds Apart (This one long as hell). If you want a depressive with cause album get Neil Young's tonight's The night.<br />Btw, saw Bruce' gig in Madrid in May of 2003 and I was mildly disappointed because the setlist included way too many new songs (Eight to be exact) and also cheesy stuff like Dancing In The Dark and Darlington County, to the detriment of three inevitable showstoppers like Thunder Road, Backstreets or Jungleland. These ones shall NEVER be left out of his setlist and in the gig I atended the first two were not played. <br />In a nutshell - thank you Bruce for sticking to the E Street Band (you should never have left them in the first place) but next time try to record a more spontaneous and less ponderous album.
B00004XMVL|5.0|This film is so good it should be placed in hermetically sealed theatre and only shown to the five richest people in the universe(of which i am seven).<br />To begin with, Vin Diesel shows he has more than just a deep voice inside his heavily waxed head, giving the kind of performance that directors like Rob Cohen seem to lose in favour of explosions and idiotic one liners. he's ably supported by Cole Hauser (who you will spot in Good Will Hunting and Tigerland) and Rhada Mitchell plus a cast of unknowns who play victims very well, especially the Paris P. Ogelvee character, who is hilarious.<br />The script is good, building good characters, even the minor ones who get picked off by the vicious aliens, and throwing one or two unexpected twists into the mix, along with nice set pieces, and comes up with good ways to work round the lack of light that gives the movie it's name.<br />The set pieces and special effects are also top notch, with director David Twohy opting, probably due to low budget, to keep the monsters in the dark and not ruin all the realism by carting out some rubber CGI piece of crap-ola that is so obviously green screened in it makes you want to stick your face in a colostomy bag.<br />To put it simply, if you like horror movies, sci-fi, or Vin Diesel, get this film. and quick, before i comission the hermetically sealed theatre.
B000089J0R|3.0|Considering that Dragonforce are about to fling a new slab of breakneck-paced melodic metal at the world, I figured it was high time I put down my thoughts on the debut, after having a year to take it in.  Obviously, the most striking feature is their sheer speed, matching the velocity of most thrash bands, but infusing it with a keen melodic sensibility.  These choruses are some of the catchiest I have ever heard. The production is very top heavy; a little scratchy on the ears at high volumes, but I suspect that the material translates well into a live setting.  The guitar solos shred so hotly I'm surprised Herman Li's guitars don't burst into flame; but, they can be over the top with the flash and pomp.  They can write some great hooks, but the songs are not varied enough to make this a truly special experience; it holds on for a long time provided you don't listen to it too much so that it stays fresh.  If they can exert more range in their tempos and dynamics in the future, they could easily top this respectable, but not great, debut full length.  I've got my fingers crossed.
B000000OS2|5.0|One of the Best Live Albums out there ! A must have for your collection .
B00005NRN9|3.0|This was the film made for the IMAX theaters so as with most IMAX films it is shorter than your average movie.<BR>Frankly I found the begining dull the water ballet slow and not at all entrancing. The rest was lovely but they were all acts that can bee seen on other discs with other shows.<BR>IS the premise  a bit juvenile? Well yes it is but it was made BEFORE 9/11 so in fact it IS very 9/10 as someone arrogantly put it. And frankly Cirque is not an American company so even if this were made after 9/11 why must it reflect the jaded and negative nature that has come to pervade our nations attitude?<BR>This film is a lovely bit of fluff with no extras to speak of and nothing except recycled acts. It was lovely to see once but not worth owning IMHO.  I had no probelm with the narration but it did actually seem somewhat uneccessary the message was there inside the visuals.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|I was just wondering the name of the first song that jack black asks the kid to play on the guitar. Thanks.
0385504209|5.0|Normally I don't like mystery novels but this one was really good. I couldn't put it down. Just when you think it couldn't get any better, it does!<br />It's about Robert Langdon. He's a Harvard professor of symbology. When in Paris on business he gets an urgent late-night phone call. A curator has been murdered inside the Louvre and by the body, a code he wrote before he died which includes the words \\"Find Robert Langdon\\". The police assume that this means that Robert killed him. With the help of the curator's cryptologist granddaughter he deciphers the code (slowly but surely). One code leads them to another, so on and so forth. Soon, they discover the curator was a member of the Priory of Sion - a real secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo and Da Vinci. This society was rumored to know where the Holy Grail is.<br />I'd tell you more but I might ruin it.<br />It's a very exciting book.<br />Even if you, like me, aren't a fan of mystery novels, you should read this. It's very good.<br />I suggest you read it's prequel, Angels & Demons, first.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I've been looking everywhere.. please release the Seinfeld collection!! It would be such an awesome thing to have. I'd would def buy this.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Translation is about more than language. It's also about how we interpret each other's signs and behavior. It's so easy to be guarded in today's world. Charlotte would have every reason to put up a wall that would lock Bob Harris out. (Anyone notice that this fillm completely gives the lie to \\"When Harry Met Sally\\"?) <br />In \\"Lost in Translation\\" two people learn how to interpret each other, and learn how to let the walls down. That's a rare and beautiful thing.<br />I like what Tokyo brings to the movie. Set it in Paris or Venice, and it's just a hackneyed romantic background. A lesser director could even have turned Tokyo into a romantic background too. Instead Sofia Coppola makes it another world.<br />I don't want to say whether Bill Murray or Scarlett Johansson gave good performances. I just want to believe in sad Charlotte and disillusioned Bob. And they live in these bodies.<br />I wondered how such an honest film could get made. Cynics said it was because of who Sofia Coppola's father was. And then I read that in its first three weekends in US cinemas alone it earned MORE than it had cost to make it. That doesn't count the weekdays in between, and all the days it's been on since, and all the video sales. The good news is such an honest film got made because so many people wanted to see it. And the investors made a lot of money. Sadly that's always Hollywood's bottom line. <br />It's nice to see the David of true and honest film-making stand-up to the Goliath of mindless action movies and stories about sex-crazed teens and pies. I am so happy this film did so well, and that as many people love it as much as I do. Maybe, that way, we'll see more like it.
B000006Z1X|4.0|With the departure of Yngwie Malnsteen, Steve Vai moves in to handle the axe duties for Alcatrazz on their follow up to a pretty sucessful No Parole From Rock and Roll. Vai wastes no time in making his mark. Gone are Malmsteen's classical runs and Blackmore riffs and in is Vai's weirdo note bending and blazing runs that are really the opposite of the Malmsteen style. But it works. It works because Vai works within the song structure and the songs are good enough to stand on their own. Vai just makes them a bit more interesting. Vai works outside to box in his solo styles breaking in new paradigms for the public to soak up. His Zappa-influenced noodlings proved to be a bit too avant-gard for run-of-the-mill metal heads, but Bonnett's lyrics have always treaded on the same ground. Vai bolted after this effort denying us a live album for future release but left in his wake another stepping stone on his way to capturing his \\"zen sound\\" in his mind. Considering Vai's future efforts of seriously progressive sounds, this is light listening material for us all. High spots are 'Mercy\\", 'Sons and Lovers\\", 'will you be home tonight' and 'stripper' . Low spots are \\"Desert Diamond' and \\"Skyfire'. Steve Vai has always seemed to me to be a guitarist without any soul to his playing, the complexity of his solo work sometimes makes even Coltrane sound mainstream and therin lies the point of his sometimes venture into souless technical playing because Vai never captured the soul of Coltrane or Miles Davis. Heck, you really cannot pigeon-hole his style at all. This works in his favor as well as it can work against him to listeners. Chalk it up to Steve doing what Steve wants to do, and that's all right by anyone. Here he is trapped within the structure of Bonnett's pop-structure songs and he pulls it off with ease. That could sum up a guitarist of Vai's genius, this stuff's too easy for him and fences him in creatively. For us, however, it's a very nice ride, even if it was a short oneat that.
0131103628|5.0|I bought this book a few years back as a first book on C programming.  I heard this book was by the smart guys that wrote the language, and I was going to get it straight from the source.  I had one problem though; I couldn't handle the info.  At that time I got discouraged 1/3 of the way through the introductory chapter and put it down.  I didn't pick it up again until a couple of weeks ago.  <br />Having since read another introductory text on C, I can understand this book now.  Now that I can understand it, I enjoy and appreciate the elegant clarity of the concise writing style.  It's a great second or third book on C.  It provides the foundations necessary to advance to the intermediate programming level and beyond.  <br />This book is very condensed.  Although it's short, it's not a book most of us will read very fast.  It's quite different from most modern books on programming.  Still, it's quite digestible if you've had a good introduction to C and programming in general.  For me, this book filled in all the nagging little questions left by other introductory books.  The index is excellent and useful.  I cannot overstate how much a good index is worth in a book like this.  Appendix A, which is a reference manual for the language is also excellent.    <br />Although the book is dated, its effectiveness is not hindered by time.  It covers the language backwards and forewards with absolute clarity.  If you really want to know C, I suggest picking up this book after an introductory text.  I know that the information in this book will save me from hours of frustrating beginner mistakes.  I think I'm ready to move on to Stevens now.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album is not amazingly complex, inventive or mind-boggling, or even that deep.  It is however, a very refreshing rock album.  The music is solid throughout, with all the psuedo-artistic weird noises you could ever need.  If any band will ever change mainstream music, it will be The Mars Volta.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is GREAT folks! Not only are all the extra scenes fully incorporated into the movie, making it even better than ever, but you also get the views of experts, like top British CS Lewis and Tolkien buff Colin Duriez, the author of some of the best books around on Tolkien. I have watched this many times - hope you do too!
0446310786|4.0|The story To Kill A Mockingbird, is a story that is set in Maycomb, Alabama during the 1960's,  when blacks and whites still didn't get along too well. The author, Harper Lee, wrote this book as if it was 8-year-old Scout Finch telling the story. This makes the story more emotional to the readers because it tells about the hard times of growing up, going to school, and dealing with life.  <br /> The story starts off as everything going pretty well in this little Alabama town with her brother Jem Finch, who is a couple years older then her, her father, Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer, and their maid, Calpurnica.  In the summer one year a boy named Dill Harris was visiting with his Aunt Stephanie, and met up with Jem and Scout and from that summer on Dill would come and stay with them.  Down the street from the Finch's there was a old house, which the Radley family used to live in.  The people said now that only the father of the family, Boo Radley lived there and he was crazy.  Each summer the children would try to make him come out of the house or atleast get a little look at him.  They never got this wish, but they still believed that he was in there, and alive.<br /> As the story continues, the children's father, Atticus, is appointed by the judge to represent a black man, Tom Robinson,  in court. The people said that Robinson raped a girl named, Mayella. Her father said that he saw Robinson do it, but with Mayella and her father testifying they came out with differnet sides of the story.<br /> The book To Kill A Mockingbird, I think, is a very good book. It tells about racism, how hurtful people can be, how loving others can be, and how no matter what someone says or does to you, that you can never stop believing in what you think is right just because someone else tells you to. I think that everyone should read this book because it really makes you think about what is important in life.
B000002KGT|3.0|Is it possible to love an album so much you begin to hate it? That's almost the case with &quot;Rumours&quot;. While I could never call it bad by any stretch, I do think some of the songs are second-rate, especially standing among the best known hits and the still flawless &quot;Dreams&quot;. As a cohesive work it falls apart near the end, but is saved by &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; one of the Mac's greatest tunes. After more than 30 million copies sold it's hard to argue with it's popularity, but &quot;Rumours&quot; is far from a masterpiece and still not quite a classic.
0736041850|5.0|I found the book most useful for determining if my workouts covered all muscle groups and specific muscles within each group. Highly recommended for experienced weightlifters. Beginning weightlifters would probably need additional assistance from another book and/or personal trainer to develop workouts. Book details movements of over 100 exercises showing many alternatives. Also details in text and pictures the exact muscles involved in each exercise. Color coding of muscle groups helpful though I found some errors.
B000002LCK|5.0|This is definitely the best album by new order. &quot;Temptation&quot; and &quot;Perfect Kiss&quot; are some of the greatest songs i've ever had the fortune to hear. I haven't listened to it for a little while, but every now and then I really get into it. When I first got it I practically listened to it for 3 months staright, that should give you some idea how good it is. I recommend you get it immediatly.

There is the black hat (again, with the U2000 logo) like the one the Edge wears, 3 guitar picks, U2000 Zippo lighter, ATYCLB CD (mine is the first to be signed) and a Certificate of Authenticity that it is 1 of the 1,000 that were only made.
B000059TEQ|5.0|I just watched Love Story on DVD - the score of the film is so memorable and on DVD it sounds great. The sweeping romanticism of the music just makes you get into the story even more.<br />Ryan O'Neal's acting was really great in this and he was very handsome as well. It's hard to believe that after this movie he made so many bad ones. (including the sequel to Love Story)<br />Ali Macgraw is so lovable and wonderful in her role as well.<br />This movie is often a target for ridicule. It is often pointed to as sentimental and saccarine. This is far from the truth - their romance is full of zest and energy. He even calls her a b*tch a couple times. It is not over the top except for the most famous line &quot;love means never..&quot; etc - that is a little cringe worthy.<br />The direction is great - the locations awesome and the acting solid. No matter how many times you see this movie the end hits you like a ton of bricks. A whole box of tissues!<br />Great movie!
B00005JN1L|5.0|Okay, so maybe this movie wasn't the best of the johnny depp collection, but it was still a good movie. The whole theater laughed plenty of times at the strange humor of the main character. This movie is not scary. It is not beautiful. It isn't expensive. It's just entertaining. It's an easy movie to watch. It's interesting, and it does have a good story. It has a happy ending... some how. Just go see it and don't listen to the negative reviews and decide for yourself.
B00005V9HH|4.0|Though this movie isn't as good as such films as Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas, it definately sits on the top of my shelf of DVD's. It drags on a little to long, but other than that Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro make the movie great. I don't want to give away the surprise ending, although probably 90% of the country has seen it, so i'll stop there. Definatley will recommend it.

0062502182|4.0|Good: Simple; easy to read; easy to understand; uplifting, positive message.<br />Bad: No life lessons you haven't already heard before; not particularly literate.<br />On the whole: It's good. It's not international-bestseller, 20-million-copy, changed-my-life good, so I'm somewhat bewildered by its popularity. But it's good. That's all.
B000066NW0|4.0|have u know this is a good CD the music is great! and how the ... is she a poser when she is not even copying anyone! she has her own taste and her own style. too ... bad if she doesn't dress like a slut like other so called \\"singers\\". So go Avril! they ain't got nothing on u!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie was amazing. It was absolutely beautiful. This is the reason that movies are made. I read Ebert's review and he said it was childish. But i think that is what Burton wanted to do with the movie. The reason it was so good, i think, was because of the simplicity of it all. Taking these old man's storys and turning them into real life. The way Burton mixed fact with fiction was amazing. Watching the way this son, who has a bad relationship with his father, react with the news that his father could be passing away very soon is amazing. The acting in this fim is awesome. The way the characters mature through this movie is outstanding. The fact that it was changed a lot from the book only adds to it, because it was like seeing 2 different awesome stories. This is an absolute must see for any fan of a good movie.
B0000DD7LC|2.0|Oh joy, another so called R&amp;B artist who over sings every other note. Some decent moments but the hints of hip hop really dash any semblance of credibility. Buy some Motown instead.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This is the best stones album. Mabey it just looks good after Satanic Majesties, but with Sympathy, Street Fighting Man and No Expectations this album is better than most bands Greatest Hits. <br />My favorite, Prodigal Son, prompted me to buy this album.<br />I have acheived satisfaction.
B00013PHGS|5.0|Unlike most Air fans, I thought 10,000 Hz Legend was BRILLIANT, and that Moon Safari was simply okay.  Don't get me wrong, I love Moon Safari, I just don't listen to it as much as the next two.  When I heard that Talkie Walkie saw the band returning to their Moon Safari sound, I was a bit disappointed.  However that comparison is completely inaccurate.  Instead, Air has blended the softness and melody of Moon Safari with the electropop experimentation of 10,000 Hz Legend.  The result is a near perfect album!  Where Moon Safari sounds like elevator music at times, Talkie Walkie sounds fresh and intriguing.  <br />The album's first single, &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot; is one of the best songs I've ever heard.  It's sweet Beatle-esque sound is completely uplifting.  &quot;Venus&quot;, &quot;Mike Mills&quot;, &quot;Universal Traveler&quot; and &quot;Another Day&quot; are also gems on this record.  From start to finish, this album is a slice of heaven.  The only drawback is that with only 10 tracks, it's too short.<br />The DVD is also incredible and (if you're an Air fan) worth the price of the CD alone!  It's five songs taken from their 10,000 Hz Legend tour (this page has the tracklisting wrong.  The second song on the DVD is &quot;Talisman&quot;).  Air reworks the songs for a live atmosphere, making them sound raw and energetic, especially &quot;Don't Be Light&quot;, which sounds and looks mesmerizing.  If this is what Air sounds like live, I can't wait to see them!
B00006RJHG|5.0|This film, despite relative obscurity and several name changes, another being &quot;Stranger In The House&quot;, is one of the scariest films you will ever see. It remains vastly underrated and little-known and is seldom praised, even today. It is a genuinely creepy film that will stay with you long after you see it. Margot Kidder steals the show as the foul-mouthed, lonely sorority sister &quot;Barb&quot;. The rest of the Canadian cast all lend good support. Like &quot;Halloween&quot;, it doesn't rely on blood and gore, but instead creates tension and suspense and a mounting sense of dread throughout the entire film. The violence is generally low-key and takes place mostly off-camera, but is nonetheless still quite jarring and effective. The surprise ending is somewhat improbable, but is chilling and will leave you feeling just a little bit uneasy when you are home alone late at night and the phone rings unexpectedly. It is a much more realistic horror film than most, in that it could really happen. It will also make you think twice about going alone into the attic!! Just one complaint, why the rather expensive price tag when compared to other films of this type??
0380715430|4.0|Clearly Bill Bryson knew what he was doing when he wrote this book, The Mother Tongue.  He uses his sense of humor and rather witty personality to incorporate in depth looks at how our English system works.  Not only does he discuss everything from where words come from to swearing and word playing, he discusses them in a manner that hits all three areas, past, present and futuristic terms. Although it would rather fit for this book to be updated for it in this day and age is a little outdated. Although with the brilliance behind Bill Bryson, he covered some what of the futuristic aspect although it seems rather in the present. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in finding a book with a witty author and a great intellectual outlook.
B000002RXS|5.0|This Carmen was one of Callas' last recordings plus her only recording of a mezzo-part. The manager of the Covent Garden Opera said that he'd pay ANY price to the person who'd tell him how to persuade Callas to sing Carmen at Covent Garden. Callas, like other primadonnas, could have had an amazing second career as a mezzo. Her middle is still in perfect shape and Carmen doesn't require high notes that might stretch. A great performance by Callas, Gedda and Pretre!
0393039765|5.0|The movie was good...  I saw the movie before I saw the book...  I read all of his other books before this one (Survivor, Invisible Monsters, Chok,e Lullaby, Fugutives And Refugees, and Diary).  Although, in my opinion all of those other books held my attention much more, maybe because I had a chance to view the movie first, FIGHT CLUB still ranks on my list as ony of the greatest novels of the decade, along with all of his other books and short stories.  Chuck Palahniuk ranks along with another of the greatest black satirists of the century, which would be Kurt Vonnegut.<br />I recommend to watch the movie first, then to read the book, because the book is still much, much, much better than the movie, but equal nonetheless.<br />A def. must-have.
B000000993|3.0|i say probably cause i havent heard lateralus yet, though it prob sounds alot like aenima. Personally i preferred the early tool, at the 'opiate' stage, when they were just makin good, straightforward rock songs. Undertow is actually quite alot like opiate in terms of how it sounds, though for some reason this time around tool felt the need to stretch every song close to or over 5 minutes, with mixed results. <br />True, there are some great songs here, sober being the greatest, easily the best song tool has ever done. Prison song is also very good, and intolerance and undertow, while having incomprehendable lyrics, arent bad either. 4 degrees is also a great song.<br />But then there are the duds. Bottom is definately the low point of the album, it just drags and the lyrics are nothing special. Crawl away and swamp song tend to act as filler, they both sound rather repetitive and boring. Flood wouldnt have been so bad if they'd cut the 4 and a half minute intro, its not even worth the wait since the song isnt that good, even if its short. And they really should have closed the album with an actual song, not just some chant repeated over and over.<br />Overall this album is pretty average. I actually think opiate is better but its hard to recommend an album with only 6 songs. Tool definately have potential, they've showed it with sober, they just have to learn to apply that genius to the whole album, not just bits and pieces of it.
B000056QE5|5.0|I saw Mary Poppins in the movies around nineteen sixty eight, It was a re-release and from that day on I fell in love with the song Spoonful Of Sugar, it is one of my favorite songs! At age forty-two I still love this song!

6300182096|4.0|Frederick Stafford playing a French intelligence officer collaborates with John Forsythe, an American counterpart to garner information concerning Russia's involvement in Cuba in 1962.  A high ranking KGB official defects from Russia and his debriefing prompts Stafford to enter Cuba, at the urging of the U.S., to conduct surveillance on the import of missiles.<br />Stafford gathers intel provided by his Cuban mistress, a widow of a top revolutionary played by an attractive Karin Dor of James Bond fame.  He manages to smuggle out the information under the suspicious eye of bearded Castro crony John Vernon.<br />Learning from Forsythe of the existence of an espionage ring, code named Topaz, a group of French politicos spying for the Russians, Stafford sets out to smash it.<br />Topaz lacked the gripping intrigue so often present in Hitchcock's work.  My appreciation for his body of work led me to be generous with my rating.
B00009Z576|4.0|The &quot;Drama&quot; album will always be somewhat of an oddity in the Yes catalogue, for no other reason that it is the only album in Yes' 35 years that does not feature leadsinger Jon Anderson. If, however, you can get beyond this, you will discover that &quot;Drama&quot;, much like its predecessor &quot;Tormato&quot; is actually a lot better than belies its reputation.<br />The &quot;Expanded and Remastered&quot; version of Drama (16 tracks; 79 min.) starts of with the original 6 tracks of the album. Among the best tracks: &quot;Machine Massiah&quot; is a return to the 10 min. epic tracks of earlier in their career, albeit with the guitars much more upfront. &quot;Into the Lens&quot; is an 8. min. romper (and later was redone as &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; by the Buggles). &quot;Run Through the Light&quot;, a minor hit, is a super-catchy power-ballad.<br />The bonus tracks go from the unnecessary (single versions of &quot;Into the Lens&quot; and &quot;Run Through the Light&quot;) to the mildy interesting (instrumentals &quot;Have We Really Got to Go Trough With This&quot; and &quot;Song No.4 (Satellite)&quot;, to the fascinating last 4 tracks. Those tracks are from the Roy Thomas Baker (famed for producing Queen era-&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;) sessions with Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman from the Fall of 1979 that eventually were abandoned. It gives a nice insight to what might have been the &quot;logical&quot; successor to &quot;Tormato&quot;, but assuming that these tracks in fact were the best from those sessions, it's easy to see why the band didn't pursue them. &quot;Golden Age&quot; is the standout song of the four.<br />In all, I cannot give enough compliments to Rhino, which has done an absolute outstanding job not only with the &quot;Drama&quot; reissue, but with the reissue of the Yes catalogue in general. Lines notes, remastering, bonus tracks, it's all here. Even if &quot;Drama&quot; isn't on your top wish list of Yes albums, you'll nevertheless enjoy this particular reissue.y this particular reissue.
B00005JME0|5.0|but this turned out to be an awesome movie. I was really reluctant to see it becuase I really do not care for Ashton Kutcher *he annoys me*, but his acting in this movie was actually very well done. The movie's plot revolves around a young man and his discovered ability to change the past by going back to key events in his life that shaped who he became. It's difficult to tell more without spoiling the movie. It really is worth viewing yourself. However, it does require close attention because it can be confusing at times. Also, the ending is wonderfully bittersweet and really tied together the film. A definite 5 star viewing. Even if you are unsure about Ashton, the movie is really worth it.
0440237688|4.0|If I could I would give this book 3.5 stars.  There was some good qualities.  It was also a little disturbing at times, such as the part where you get released.  I also did not like the ending of the book.  If you are under the age of 11 then I would not suggest this book to you.  Otherwise you will probably enjoy yhis book.
B0000C9JFO|3.0|A quint eurpoean movie, but no haute culture here. It's a simple, fun movie.
B0000524CY|5.0|I first saw this movie when i was twelve and i realize now I should have never been allowed to see this movie until I was much older. Everything about this movie scares me. From Linda Blair's demonic voice to the priest's dreams. After seeing it when I was twelve I vowed to never watch it again until I was around 21 when they put out the version you've never seen and I figured since I was older I would be OK with seeing it again...WRONG! After seeing some of the new subliminal messages or demonic white faces flash up, I turned it off and can't watch it. It is that scary to me still. I gave it five stars because it is an execellent scary movie. The acting is awesome and the story is downright terrifying but to save myself from nightmares I probably won't watch it again. :) If you want something that is still scarier than anything they've ever put out in my opinion in the scary movie buisness buy this movie. You won't be disappointed.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|SHE'S BACK! Britney has completely suprised me (and apparently everyone else) by her transition to more adult-oriented pop.  This album is never a dull moment and is the only album of hers that I actually could listen to all the way through and enjoy every moment.  My only complaint is the Ying-Yang twins song being a bit dated in like 2 years, when the other bonus tracks of foreign releases sound so much better.  If you have any interest, buy this.  Me Against the Music wasn't my fave, and Toxic is great and yet is nothing like the rest of the album.  So many different sounds and styles, each of them work and she makes them her own.  If you bought her other stuff and were continually dissapointed, like I was, trust this time - it's better and makes you want to throw her other cds away.
0380807343|5.0|I had heard about this book from school from many people, so I decided to buy it.  This is the first book I have read by Neil Gaiman.  I was not sure if I would like it, because I had heard it was scary from other reviews.  It was a little scary at times but, over all I liked it(a lot.)  If you do not want to know the plot of the story revealed then I suggest you do not read the rest of my review.  Hopefully this review will answer who, what, where, and when this story takes place.<BR><BR>Who: The main character in this book is Coraline.(really)<BR><BR>What: Coraline is trying to get her mother back from her other mother.<BR><BR>Where: This story takes place in her grandma's mansion.<BR><BR>When: This story takes place during modern times.
B000002J0B|5.0|This is Zep at its peak!  This is when the drugs were still running high, but the youthful energy was still there to keep it in check.  After this album, the long slide down started, accelerated by the death of Bonham.  I never get tired of this album.  It still sounds as fresh as when I heard it all those years ago.  The Ocean is a fantastic opener with tons of tasty guitar licks.  Page is amazing throughout the entire album.  Folks don't give Zep enough credit.  You hear so much of their sound and riffs in today's music.  A must-have for every collection.
B00013F38K|5.0|Hi everyone! First let me say that Kung Fu is the best television series ever produced (in my opinion). I am a fan of such shows as Babylon 5, Star Trek, Lost in Space, Doctor Who, The Shadow, Escaflowne, Macross Plus and many others. I won't go into long explanations but here's what I would like anyone to know visiting this page.<br />1. Bruce Lee didn't develop the series, he had a similar idea which was never fully written out. It just so happens that the 2 creators of Kung Fu had been working on a similar notion. (refer to The Kung Fu Book by Anderson, Robert). What this means is that those of you upset Bruce Lee didn't recieve this role shouldn't get angry because Bruce never really developed this idea. There are alot of misconceptions about Bruce Lee. I would suggest the book The Tao of Bruce Lee which offers deeper insights into him. Though the book still states Bruce Lee developed Kung Fu (incorrect).<br />2. David Carradine is the best actor for the role. Even if Bruce Lee had been given it he was to aggressive for the play required. There are no conspiracy's about this, Bruce was simply to well known for violence. In fact it had been noted he liked to play pranks on people such as going into a dinner with red contacts on pretending to be blind. Then he would procede to trick the waiter into thinking he was some kind of mystical guru. Yes there is all that and more about the man.<br />This is it for now. ...
1400049628|4.0|The book is exactly what you would expect.  It does seem to lack practical application, but it is a perfect skewering of survival manuals and is generally good for laughs.
0553801546|5.0|I love the world and the characters that have been created throughout the farseer and tawney man trilogies. I find myself caught up in the power struggles as well as the inner struggles of the characters especially Fitz. I think that if a book can make you truly emotionally vested in the characters and the plot than it's a success. Robin Hobb has done this consistently through both these trilogies and i'm just sorry to see this story end, i really didn't want to finish this story.
B00006RU5B|5.0|A great album! Formed by the union of former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell and the former musicians of Rage (Tom Morello, Tom Commerford, &amp; Brad Wilk), AUDIOSLAVE is neither of the former bands.  While sharing similarities with the two it stands out as an origional musical creation.  Chris Cornell's introspective lyrical poetry and soaring vocal talent, is effortlessly combined with the funk rock groove of Tom Morello's guitar artistry.<BR>  This is a CD which sounds better every time you hear it. You won't tire of this CD. As a musician (vocals and piano) I can say that I'm impressed.  TRUE MUSIC!  If you have a chance, see them live!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye is the hottest producer/rapper out there right now. He admittedly trips on his lyrics on occassion but I don't think I have heard anyone drop beats like this since Dr. Dre &amp; Mel Man. As evidenced by the last track, this is a well polished work, not another Jay-Z type album thrown together in two days. HOT hOt  - ()T !!!!!
B000002J2B|5.0|It's probably a bit too much to say that it went downhill for Genesis after this album, but there were enough signs in this production (the second after Peter Gabriel's departure from the band) indicating the direction they'd later take. Still, this is a SOLID album, one of mythical proportions that one can easily fall short of describing appropriately.<br />There's some classic ballads that Genesis would become famous for later on (&quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot;) as well as the power prog-rock tracks (most of the rest of the album), running side by side in a non-accidental way, giving both longtime fans of the band and followers of their more commercial work (to come in the early and mid-eighties), something to hold on to. I'd argue, though, that there's far more musical treats in this album for the hardcore Genesis fan. The impeccable solo lines by Banks and Hackett (who would depart from the band after this production to focus on his solo work), alongside the grandieuse drumming by maestro Phil Collins (his singing wasn't too bad either) make this a very well rounded production that stands comfortably among the best prog rock albums of a musical period that was close to becoming &quot;dormant&quot; in 1976, but just to be revisited several years after by bands such as Marillion, IQ and Arena.<br />In sum, a classic prog album that has stood the test of time for almost two decades now, and a must in any serious collection with ambitions to cover the prog-rock genre.
0385507755|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It was the most truthful account of addiction.  Out of all the books I have read on addiction/substance abuse, this was definitely the best.  I really enjoyed reading about James and all the other characters in the book - I couldn't put the book down!  I look forward to reading more books by James Frey.
B00018D44U|2.0|Norah Jones' latest effort was dissapointing to say the least. I felt there was potential to her when I listened to her first album, but after listening to this album certainly I am not \\"feeling the same way.\\" The first few songs stand out, but in general the album is (yes, you've heard it before) booooring and repetitive. It's hard to put your finger on almost any song after the fifth track because they all sound very similar and, in a way, dull. \\"The Prettiest Thing\\" and the closing Ellington song \\"Don't Miss You At All\\" are the only other songs that stand out in the second half of the album: the rest I can totally live without. Granted I loved the use of electric piano on some of the tracks, giving them a bit of an edge, overall I don't see this as more than a two-star album. I recommend Jacqui Naylor's 'Shelter' -far better!
B00005JLK1|3.0|First of all I dont want to scare anyone away from watching &quot;Ghost Ship.&quot; (no pun intended) Fans of Juliana Marguilles who want to know what she's been doing since she left her job at the county ER will enjoy this movie, because she is the star. This movie has apparitions, doors slammings, thunks, thuds, blood curdling scenes of mayhem, and more. Once the stars are stuck on the ship we see some weird behavior start. If you enjoyed Jack Nicholson in &quot;The Shining&quot; (he's not in this) you may enjoy the way the crew of this little salvage ship slowly has their minds taken over by the terror filled ship, just as Jack was taken over by the Overlook Hotel. I'll just say this: What happened in the past is sure to happen again and again on this ship unless our crew becomes aware of the situation. There is a neat little plot twist at the end that could set up a &quot;Ghost Ship II.&quot; The price is right, its a fun adventure.On a par with &quot;The Fog.&quot;
B00005JKOI|3.0|This was an okay movie.  The soundtrack is much better than the movie.  One reason to watch the movie is to listen for the songs that are on the soundtrack.  I can't stand Blaine.  I don't know why she would end up with him and not Duckie.  The ending is not realistic.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The fact that the extra scenes are seemlessly worked into the DVD as if they were always there is the major plus to this DVD and made it worth the money alone. But we do also, in the fascinating &quot;making of&quot; interviews, get not just the usual making of interviews but also experts - and here it really is worth it just for Colin Duriez, whose books on both Lewis and Tolkien (and his wonderful new book on their friendship) gives it the extra edge that the previous DVD versions did not have. So buy it for the extra scenes and for Colin Duriez. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHURCHILL'S FOLLY (Carroll and Graf) and CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan).
1878424319|5.0|In theory, \\"The Four Agreements\\" by Don Miguel Ruiz is a very useful book. I agree with the ideas and hope to live my life by them. I try to. And that is what I believe the author's goal is in writing this book, to at least just try to live by them. I appreciate the philosophy and hope to have it become a part of how I look at the world and life in general. It is a hard philosophy to obtain with one reading though. The author does explain the four agreements very well and why they are important, but I have a hard time applying them to everyday life-at least all at once. I guess in that aspect, I was a little disappointed. I needed some sort of guidance that wasn't there. (I did notice that there is a companion book that should aid in this area.) I think this is a very good book and is worth the time and effort to be read. <br />Another book that I feel will help in finding inner happiness along with \\"The Four Agreements\\" is \\"Ask and You Shall Receive\\" by Mary Anne Thomas. Her little book has a wealth of information on finding what it is you are looking for and how to obtain it by becoming closer to God. Her short stories that led her to writing this book read honest and as though she understood what I needed to hear to ask for that I am looking for and why. Her exercises and explanations for them were thorough and very helpful. She guided me though each exercise with explanations as to why they were needed and how they worked. I think this is a very good book and would make a great companion book to \\"The Four Agreements.\\"
B0000683DH|5.0|I'm a trekkie from way back.  My favorite episode was the one with Khan - so it might not be any surprise that ST2-Khan is my favorite of the ST movies.  The thing is though - even so - it still is the best movie.  It's simple, it's got action, it's got camp, seriousness, excitement and yes, things get blown up!<br />Lots of great characters.  I happen to like Judson Scott (was in the TV Series, The Phoenix).  He's not even named in the credits - but he's Khan's right-hand man who gets killed - this movie's famous &quot;no name character who always seems to get killed&quot;)  I'd have bought this movie just for him!  But no need - I loved this movie right from the start before I knew he was in it!<br />A young Kirstie Alley is here as well.<br />Even if you aren't a Trek fan - you could love this movie!

0790729628|5.0|the original is a work of art that was vandalised by hollywood studio bosses who presumably thought that the audience wouldn't be bright enough to understand it without the cringe worthy, chandleresque monologue (God forbid who should have to use our brains).  And as for the spliced on up-beat ending (Cos nobody will watch a film that doesn't have a sugar coated, inspirational finale).  This took the shine off an absolute classic film which unlike modern Sci Fi (ie - the matrix) never devolves into a mere brainless action film, and is as thought provoking as it is entertaining.  Unfortunately, films like this are unlikely to be made anymore - if it was then studio bosses would insist it star Bradd Pitt, with the poignant scene on the rooftop exchanged for a kung foo fight, replete with cheesy one liners and bare chested movie stars. The last great Sci Fi for people with a brain!

B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna's Ray of Light is my favorite album of hers.  I just love listening to this album when I need a mood shift from being stressed. This album introduced me to the world of techno and electronic music, which I am a big fan now.  This is probably the best album of the 90's, as well as the best of album Madonna has created,  in my opinion.  It is worth every penny. MADONNA ROCKS!!!

When I listen to this album, I can actaully remember my friends and I used to sing and dance to this album as kids.  Still to this day, my friends and I enjoy listening to the tracks during one our many road trips.  I don't know, this album is just a good reminder of being a kid and not being stressed from daily situations.  I have had to buy this album three times so far and it was well worth it. This is one of the few albums that I like all of the tracks, which is a big plus for me.  MADONNA ROCKS!!!

She has always been one of my favorite actresses, and 5 years ago I realized she was my all-time favorite: she has endeared herself to me in her most well-known films such as My fair Lady, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and Roman Holiday (all of which I love).    But I have also been viewing her lesser-known films, such as The Nun's Story (excellent), Children's Hour (excellent), and -- most recently -- \\"Two for the Road.\\"    When I first rented the movie, I had =no= idea what to expect, so at first I was a bit surprised and let down that the relationship that Hepburn's character (Joanna Wallace) has with the leading male is not all sweet and sugary such as that in Roman Holiday.  In fact, the relationship she has with Albert Finney's character (Mark Wallace) is \\"basically volatile\\" -- as Wallace's friend and ex-lover points out -- and is filled with \\"sniping\\" and mutual loathing--at least by the time they have been married for ten years.    However, by the time the film was over, I realized it was the most realistic movie about the vicissitudes of long-term relationships that I had ever watched. And that I would be recommending this little-known film to all my friends, especially my married and divorced ones (i.e., I think one has to have been married and/or divorced to =really= appreciate the film, although other reviewers have pointed out that they were single when they first viewed it and that it made a lasting  impression on them).    I myself was married 2 weeks shy of 14 years (in a very volatile relationship), and to me this film is \\"spot on\\" when it comes to portraying the different phases that many long-term relationships go through: the first months of almost absolute bliss; the early, pre-child years, when the arguments that occur only presage later, more serious ones; the years when a child only adds stress to a relationship already at a breaking point; the 6th-8th year when the couplecan't stand each other; [the whole 7-year itch factor];  to the 10th-12th year when the couple still cannot stand each other, only pretend to be happily married, but stay together because \\"it is worth it sometimes,\\" and because they discover they need each other.  As Finney's character wryly remarks: If there is one thing I really despise is an \\"indispensible woman.\\"      I give \\"Two for the Road\\" 4 out of 5 stars.  The performance by Hepburn is extraordinary--given that she convincingly plays the same woman, Joanna Wallace, over a 12-year period, varying between a 20-something fresh youth who is \\"three-dimensional as it happens\\" -- Viewers of the film will recognize that quote -- to a thirty-something mother-with-child (\\"pregnant sow\\").    The film abounds with such wry remarks, excellent editing (making the film a bit tricky to follow, but which in turn adds to the pleasure of mulitple viewing).      Other reviewers have mentioned that the scenes cut between four different \\"road trips\\" that Mark and Joanna Wallace make, but in my count there are at least five:    (a) the one where they first meet and fall in love when hitchiking;  (b) the one where they are newlyweds travelling with friends of Mark (the American couple with a bratty daughter);  (c) the one where they are in the \\"old MG\\" [green car] (and eventually meet Maurice, Mark's soon-to-be all-consuming employer);  (d) the one where they are travelling together with their own daughter: on the road and in the hotel where the boiled egg doesn't arrive;  (e) the one where they are travelling without their daughter, en route to meet Maurice; the trip that starts and ends the movie;    Hepburn's acting was superb, while Finney's was enjoyable.  His character hardly changes in appearance over the 10-12 years, and his imitation of Humphrey Bogart is weak and therefore unnecessary.  But he does deliver his lines well if somewhat too laconically.    Memorable quotes abound from this film, as in Breakfast at Tiffany's (which remains my favorite of Hepburn films)...    ----\\"We agreed before we got married we weren't going to have children,\\" says Finney's character.    ----\\"And before we were married, we didn't,\\" slyly retorts Hepburns' character.    The dialogue is as catchy as the editing and the acting.    4 out 5:  Even though I am a huge Audrey Hepburn fan, and even though the movie is one of her best... still it is probably not (yet) in my top fifty movies of all time...well, maybe #50.  (There are an awful lot of movies out there!)      But I would still say that it is the most realistic film about relationships that I have seen, and certainly the most realistic film about relationships that Hepburn stars in.  And \\"star in\\" she does in \\"Two for the Road\\": as in most her movies, her personality and--in this case-- her superb acting *make* the movie.  She plays the gamut of absolute giddyness to the depths of grief in a very believeable and touching manner.    I plan to purchase the film for multiple viewings.  And it is a definite \\"must see\\" and \\"must have\\" for Hepburn fans.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Knowing Sarah's inspirational lyrical writing and musical talent, it would be unfair to suggest that this was her best piece of work. But for the sake of putting aside any comparisons, this album does indeed hold enough merit of it's own. The songs are touching to the heart and despite mentions of the album's short tracklistings, it is still a musical experience that can be fully enjoyed.<br />This album get's 5 stars from me, I applaud Sarah for making such a strong comeback to the music industry.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; takes aim at its viewers at a visceral level. It's subtlety seems to have been lost on some viewers; there is so much richness in the film if one is willing to take in its feeling rather than looking for a well-defined and action-packed plot line. This is not a film that can easily by explained or fully appreciated after just one viewing.<br />As to accusations of racism in the film - I think that's pure, unadultrated bunk. One reviewer mentioned a scene with Bill Murray surrounded by a number of much-shorter Japanese folks as being &quot;racist&quot;. What if that scene was instead meant to highlight Bill Murray's character's displacement and awkwardness? To me, that's what that scene accomplished. It's all a matter of perspective, I suppose.
B0000028RR|5.0|And thus begins what would be known now and forver as Rage Against the MAchine.  An anti-governmental rap metal monster.  And a good one, no a GREAT one at that.  I don't care if you like the gov't or not, you have to like or at least respect this band.  They let themselves be known and you can't help to rock along on the way.  This is by far their best album and is very suprising as it is their debut.  Debut albums don't have the *right* to be this good.  But somehow they made it and it is freakin' classic!  <br />I know I like to pop this album in on the election days baby.  You know its just another bombtrack.
B000053VAF|4.0|First off, Dogma isn't supposed to be takin seriously.  None of Kevin Smith's movies are, for that matter.  So, for all of you naysayers who do nothing but harp on this movie, please, do all the fans a favor: GET OVER IT, AND DON'T WATCH IT!!!  Now, that's been said, on to the movie.  This was the first Kevin Smith movie I had ever viewed, and from the get go, I liked it.  The acting, for all characters, is enjoyable.  You can believe the actors are there characters (which is kind of the point, right?).  As a Catholic myself, I was apprehensive of this film, until I realized that it is just a movie.  If you're the type of person who can watch a movie, and not take all of its messages to heart, please, view this one.  Actually, there is one good idea that this movie brings to light.  There is a line in the film that says &quot;So you believe now?&quot;  &quot;No, but I have a pretty good idea.&quot;  This line refers to the thought of religion, and if you are one those fanatics, then maybe it isn't your flick.  But maybe, just maybe, you can walk away laughing, and even thinking, which I believe was Kevin Smith's main idea.
B0001611DI|3.0|I am a big fan of this film and of Romero's work  Anchor Bay has again managed to pick my pocket with yet another bare bones edition of this great movie, for the price (cheap only 13.00) a die-hard fan will relish the superb commentary( Thanx to Perry Martin)  by George his wife Chris Romero and the special effects king Tom Savini. If you can wait the deluxe edition comes out in September, Oh please put Document of the dead on this edition.:-)
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I have seen the movie 3 times and i bought the soundtrack the other day and I have to say listening to it brought tears to my eyes again.  Each song took me back to it's corresponding scene in the movie (i was sobbing when the track Mary goes to Jesus came on, if u haven't seen the movie, go see it and you too will be moved).  This is a very beautiful and haunting soundtrack that will hopefully inspire you as you listen to it.  It's definitely a great cd to have on repeat just quietly playing in the background no matter what you are doing. I was saddened not to hear the music from the trailer not put on the cd.  I hope they rerelease the cd to include this piece.  It's what brought the most tears to my eyes whenever i viewed the trailer online at the official website and it's one of the main reason why i bought the cd.  <BR>Get it and experience the moving music from The Passion!  *PS, if you read the liner notes, you will see that Mel lent his vocals to a track or two!*
B00008S2VG|5.0|This has to be one of Madonna's best album!!!!Very personal, touching lyrics, amazing beats, beautiful melodies...the only reason it did bad was because of the American Life video and all the brouhaha that surrounded it...If you ask me I think it's sad...Hollywood, Love profusion and Nothing fails are some of Madonna's greatest work.I have to say one thing...in America they say there is freedom of speach but as soon as you talk your mind out loud they drag you down...and that is the case with this album. It did good around the world but in America it did very poorly...all this because she speaks her mind...Madonna, keep illuminating and inspiring our souls with your beautiful music...I think you truly rock.
B000002KO3|5.0|Probably my favorite Talking Heads album (&quot;More Songs About Buildings and Food&quot; a close second), &quot;Remain in Light&quot; is sort of an ironic title. For me, there's an underlying darkness and gloominess to the songs, even the upbeat, dancable numbers. Seems the melodies are a little less bouncy than some other Heads material. Byrne was never the most optimistic lyricist, but for this album, a lot of the subject matter is pretty dire, dealing a lot with self-doubt and fear of change (&quot;Seen and Not Seen,&quot; &quot;Crosseyed and Painless,&quot; and the classic &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot;), and even imperialism and  terrorism (&quot;Listening Wind&quot;). And then, of course, there's &quot;The Overload,&quot; an incredibly menacing-sounding drone of a song. <br />Best songs are &quot;Born Under Punches,&quot; full of subtle guitar plinks and plops, and a great (GREAT!) keyboard solo that sounds right out of an Atari 2600 game, and &quot;The Great Curve,&quot; thanks to propulsive percussion and the overlapping, chanting vocals that strain the ear in the best way possible.<br />It's EXTREMELY obvious that Eno had a firm hand in the production of this album, and that's a good thing -- everything he does turns to pure musical gold, even with a band like U2! If he can make U2 sound great, damn, he's good.
0385504209|1.0|Why did I read \\"The Da Vinci Code?\\" First, a couple of friends suggested that I do so.  One had begun reading it, and recommended it; the other had had it recommended to her, and wanted me to do the dirty work. Second, I noticed that it was incredibly popular.  There were 91 hold requests on it at the local public library.  I found a copy on the shelf at the university library, which was recalled the day after I checked it out, but that left me time to read it. Third, what I heard about it made it sound suspiciously familiar, but I couldn't be sure unless I read it myself.  So I did. I wasn't expecting \\"literature\\", contrary to what one of the other two thousand-plus reviewers said.  It was marketed as a thriller, and high literature rarely makes it onto the middlebrow New York Times best-seller lists unless Oprah recommends it. But even with my lowered expectations, I was startled at how bad the writing was.  Dan Brown is no John LeCarre, but he isn't even grand-master hack Lawrence Block.  Brown's somewhere down there with, say, David Baldacci, whose \\"Absolute Power\\" I once read with similar incredulity.  (Those who think \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is the worst book ever written should try \\"Absolute Power.\\"  Or something by Rita Mae Brown.) I know little about art history, or the geography of Paris.  But I'm pleased to see that Brown's factual inaccuracy wasn't limited to matters Biblical. The notion that Jesus wasn't considered \\"the son of God\\" by Christians until after 300, for instance, is absurd.  How \\"the son of God\\" was interpreted changed, but the terminology is at least as early as the apostle Paul. Brown clearly thinks that the Dead Sea Scrolls were Christian writings (nope, they were pre-Christian Jewish.) The Nag Hammadi \\"Gnostic\\" writings, far from challenging Jesus' divinity, exalt it even more.  They certainly don't show him as a human prophet. I'm no fan of Christianity in any of its forms, but Brown's fantasies are an embarrassment to any well-informed infidel.  That so many reviewers here claim that they've never run into these ideas before just shows how ill-informed most Christians are.  Brown's theories are derivative from start to finish. (Except maybe for his tribute to Walt Disney as a modern Da Vinci, an artistic genius of the same rank, a devout Goddess-worshipper secretly trying to keep the Divine Feminine Principle alive in his masterworks like \\"The Little Mermaid.\\")  ...nfidel.

Also, the two Fatal 4-Way Tag Championship matches were surprisingly good along with the U.S. Championship Match! But the one match which truly let alot of people down was Goldberg vs. Lesnar. Stone Cold saved the match with his post-match Stunners to Brock and Goldberg! Most importantly, Torrie, Sable, Stacy, and Jackie looked fine ashell in their Evening Gowns and their match was pretty cool! Overall, excellent PPV!
B00006GJ9F|2.0|The &quot;Japanese Bonus Track&quot; &quot;Why&quot; is on the North American CD as well, in the enhanced CD part (so only accessible from a computer with a CD-ROM drive).  There are two versions of this song though (one for tender American ears with the swearing cut out (that's the one on the NA CD and on the American Wedding Soundtrack Album) and one for the rest of the world (that was actually played during American Wedding).  Not sure which version is on the Japanese Album though.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|I've read a lot of the reviews... I just wanted to say that it's not just about drug additiction - a lot of it is veered that way but it's mostly about abuse to yourself and shows you the gory details... shows you the hrash reality... shows you what poeple normally leave out. Something about this movie itself is addicting. I read the book afterwards and it was even better in the book. I recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B000099T2L|4.0|the best song on here is hip hop star...but unless ur a girl, dont buy this album.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A must see. This movie was awesome but not one I would watch over and over... don't take it the wrong way... the movie was amazing. So amazing that it put me in this melancholy state for a week. I think that everyone, especially teenagers, should see this movie atleast once. It made me think twice about the path I was taking and opened my eyes a lot. It was like a real-life culture shock... on t.v. I really can't describe it but I must say - you have to see it, maybe only once but it's worth the buy... you'll want everyone to see it.
B000069AUI|5.0|this album is so good..its worth the buy, but their 1st album is sooooo much better...give that a listen, and you'll be hooked like a dope fiend.
0060730552|5.0|As someone who is active in alpine style mountaineering, I can personally attest to the pure accuracy of the descriptive emotions Joe Simpson so eloquently describes.  I could not put this book down once I started reading it and was finished within 24 hours.  For those who may struggle with much of the climbing terminology in the book, there is a brief dictionary of terms in the back of the book.  Joe has captured in words what I have struggled for years to try and describe to others concerning the pure beauty and phsycial emotions one experiences when suffering on the mountain.  In addition, the movie is an exact match of the book in terms of detail and event.  I've never seen such a precise replication of a book when it becomes a movie before. In addition, the technical climbing aspects (knots, belays, protection, route finding, weather concerns, et al.) are precise as well.  Great book, and if you get a chance, great movie(actually documentary).
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This is a movie well worth watching at least once. I won't talk about the plot because its already been discussed in other reviews. It is not a moving or compelling film, just a very excellent action/comedy flick. It gives you plenty of laughs and keeps you on the edge of your seat the first time around. It will keep your adrenaline pumped and the ending, although not amazing, is pretty good. The actors work very well together and Mark Wahlberg does a good job as the leading actor. If you don't want a mindless action film then don't buy this. But if you want something you can soon forget and get plenty of laughs out of then this is the movie for you to see.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is perhaps one of the most tedious, mind-numbing films I've ever seen.  Can't imagine what all the hype was about.  Don't waste your money or your time. It is dull, slow, and has no redeeming features beyond a tawdry view of Tokyo nightlife.
B000002B35|5.0|This is perhaps one of the greatest live CDs of all time. It includes the very best of Pink Floyd with the very best of David Gilmour. Anyone looking for a compilation of PF's work should turn to this. It might be expensive, but it is worth every penny. If you are looking for highlights then the Encore of Comfortably Numb is breath taking, as is Wish You Were Here. From the fist CD, Sorrow and in particular Coming back to life are excellent, showing to the world that Pink Floyd did not need Roger Waters to be a truly great performing band.<BR>On the whole a superb cd that cannot be missing from a Pnk Floyd fan's collection. (cool front cover too!)
B00005RZV4|5.0|Nine inch Nails has always been a favorite band of mine...For many years now. I bought this CD second, after buying the downward spiral. Every song is AMAZING. After listening to Hurt, The day the whole world Went away, Starfu**ers and of course, closer, I WAS HOOKED.Listening to this CD everyday, I promised myself I would buy every CD they ever made. This CD has many of the huge hits, as well as many beautifully created tracks.If you heard about NIN and want to buy one of their CDs to &quot;try it out&quot; and see if you like them, purchase this one.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The best I can say for this film is: mediocre.  It seemed to sluggishly ride the fence between romance and art film and did neither very well.  There were some entertaining moments in the beginning with Bill Murray playing the has been Bob Harris.  But even then he seemed to disdain the Japanese he'd come to work for more than feel that he was the one out of place.  I kept waiting for the promised \\"valentine ... to the city of Tokyo\\" that never rose out of the mundane scenes.<br />  The film was bogged down further by the tepid Charlotte.  Here she is in one of the most beautiful and dynamic cities in the worlds and she can't begin to figure out how to enjoy herself.  Proving once again that people who are bored are usually boring, Charlotte had me wanting to fast forward every time she came on the screen.<br />  Perhaps the lack of depth is due to the fact that Sophia Copala is still young and simply hasn't experienced enough of life to make a more compelling piece.  But I just kept wishing that she'd give her characters something to \\"say.\\"  Unfortunatly, I don't believe that she had anything particular to say herself.  Hence the end, where Bob whispers in Charlotte's ear and the viewer is left to imagine for themselves that Bob had something more profound to say than:  \\"I'll never forget you and we'll always have Tokyo.\\"<br />  If you subscribe movie channels already and nothing else is on you may want to catch this on Showtime, otherwise don't spend you're money on this movie. If your looking for a lovely, slow romantic art film, get Enchanted April.  If you want to see great footage of Tokyo, turn to the Travel Channel.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Yep, one of my most vivid memories is that Latina with the great lips leaning out the drive-thru window and saying to Annette Bening, \\"You are SO busted.\\" Great, great, great, and so was the rest of the movie (except the ending kind of sucked, but it's hard to see how it could have ended any other way, and besides, from the very beginning you know he's telling us his story from beyond the grave).<BR>It's the angst of suburban life, domestic tragedy, and social commentary played with biting sarcasm that drives this picture, with Kevin Spacey coming unglued with a case of delayed adolescent lust for a very pretty cheerleader, played by Mena Suvari). Annette Bening plays his uptight materialistic, real-estate agent wife to absolute perfection; you just LOVE to hate her. And then there's their teenage daughter going through more than the usual teenage girl stuff and playing her utter contempt for both parents to a tee. It feels like she's not even acting, especially in the excruciatingly tense dining room scene. <BR>And then there's the really creepy neighbor...and there wouldn't have been a movie without him.<BR>Wow, what a coup. See it now, if you haven't already.
0060012218|3.0|As an adult, I found this a swell read.  I am glad that there are more and more books like this available that don't focus on sex as much as they do self-awareness and coming to power. The characters are all interesting, though a few are a bit underdeveloped.  I think terese and Ike got short shifted, and I would have liked to know more about them and what they were thinking.  My only real problem with the story is that at the end of the book, the narrator takes too high of a road. I found it inconsistent that a character who was just coming out and had all the normal anxieties and hormones of a young guy would make such adult decisions about his relationship, etc.  It does not ring true, and seems to have been in there to give him some noble bearing. It's a bit unnecessary as there was no real reason for the choice he makes. I think it was a poor one.  This was a good reading experience and it took me back to high school and made me think, \\"If ..\\"  This book is an enoyable read for people of all stripes.

0671027344|5.0|I am left with this odd fuzzy feeling inside. Not fuzzy like the exact instant when my lips touches the girl i loved for the first time; or fuzzy like getting a hug...a long hug, that has more meaning than something you do when you see someone. This fuzzy feeling is somewhat empty, but an understanding type of emotion, where i feel more enlightened of the world and how it functions, but feel the absence of the essence of the presence of this emotion im lacking of. And this is more than just about love. Its more about revelations of the first time, and how i feel when i think back in reverie, and what it meant to me then and how it means to me now. And all this came from me reading the first 60 pages or so of Perks Of Being a Wallflower. I feel stunned. Zombie-like, how much this strikes me to be how i feel. You know the feeling when you read a really meaningful book, and at certain times, it just clicks? You pull the words, the thoughts, out of the page and out of the context, and you really relate yourself. I am compelled to type not on what so much the book says, but on how i feel when i look up from the pages and realize that yes, that is what i failed to realize. Sorry this isnt a review, this coming of age novel for a teen in high school, written through letters, has more meaning to me through how anyone can relate to this.
0688163173|1.0|Ok, I loved Mystic River, but this book? I got about a third of the way thru then just gave up. And the first (about) 50 pages - I have NO idea what in the world was going on! Then after that, they kept repeating themselves over and over again. She was barefoot, the windows were barred, they were on an island -- I get it! I use to NEVER give up on a book without trudging through - but these days, I'm starting to do just that more and more. I wish there could be a money-back guarantee - - I'm wasting so much money!
B00005JLXE|1.0|As a kid, I was a big comic fan, and Daredevil was one of my favorites (along with Spider-man and X-men), so I was looking forward to this movie.  Everything bad I heard about it put it lower on my list of movie-going priorities, and I eneded up missing it in the theaters, but still planned to buy it.  With lowered expectations, I was sure I couldn't be disappointed.  <br />Uggh! Was I wrong!  Affleck was a complete disaster in this movie.  The script didn't give any of the actors much of a chance of shining, but none looked so helpless and uninteresting as Ben.  One hears that he's a big Daredevil fan.  So why was he so completely unable to invest the character with even a little bit of depth or charisma?  One of the things that always made DD an interesting comic character was that he was one of Marvel's most brooding and tortured.  Ben's version is a shallow, boring horse's backside.  (OK, I never expected a lot from Affleck, who is only effective in films where he essentially plays an average guy, perhaps one with a bit of attitude - he was good in &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; and mostly acceptable but unremarkable in most of his other films.)<br />I thought Garner was mostly effective, although her chemistry with Ben was pathetic.  She was a good Electra.  Farrel was fun as Bullseye, but not really very menacing.  Unfortunately, he was the best thing about the movie.  Having been a fan of the Kingpin character in the comics, I wasn't at first thrilled about the casting of Michael Clark Duncan; changing him to a black man was OK, but I just didn't think we was  large and imposing enough.  Lord of the Rings shows that effects to make him larger were available, especially for a high-budget film.  (That said, the performance was fine.)<br />Then again, these film-makers couldn't be trusted to do effects right.  The CGI was abysmal, and many of the fighting scenes were simply ridiculous.  DD is a man with super-human senses who has trained himself as an acrobat and builtup his strength, but he's not blessed with super strength.  None of the characters, except Kingpin, should have been shown as being stronger than a normal, athletic human.  The CGI Daredevil, Bullseye, and Electra looked like Super Mario, leaping tall buildings and falling great distances without a bruise.  Dumb special effects to go with the dumb writing and directing made this movie, intended to be dark with campy comic relief, simply a dopey concoction of campy darkness.  <br />Sure, it's just a comic book movie.  But it's a bad one.  I'll take Spider-man and the 2 X-men movies over this one any day.  If there's any truth to the notion that Kevin Smith might make a DD sequel, please let him have the good sense to write it himself, recast the lead, and hire a competent special effects team!
B0000CFW87|5.0|This very talented young man makes an old has-been like me want to give love another chance, so I could get married again and have  &quot;When You Say You Love&quot; playing while saying my vows! Why rate the album notes or compare his talent to the likes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers (who I also happen to appreciate). Anyway, I digress. Whenever a song comes on in a foreign language, I think I'll bypass it just this once - but never do because each and every one of the songs on the CD is absolutely beautiful. Very often, he simply takes my breath away.
B0000CFW87|5.0|All those who complained about the songs in Spanish, French and Italian are closed-minded, uneducated and just plain stupid.  They are not the sort of people Josh makes music for, so don't even bother.  His music is a passion, not just a job.  Some songs you listen to for lyrics, other purely for the music.  I mean, come on, aren't there plenty of artists who sing English unintelligibly?

I LIKE SOME 80S AND 70S ROCK LIKE THE RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS WHO ARE VERY CREATIVE.
0671027387|3.0|OK, this book is a work of fiction, but in the beginning he says that the technologies in the book exist. Nonetheless, I found numerous inaccuracies about NASA and the NRO based on what I know from the type of work that I do. So believe very little of it. Mr. Brown either needs to get his facts straight, or quit passing off stuff as factual when he doesn't know for sure and never will. He's no Tom Clancy.<br />On a separate note, I have only the utmost respect for NASA and the NRO, despite the accidents they've had. Space is never going to be an entirely risk-free area of research and these days NASA needs all the support it can get. Anyway, I don't think that a popular author should lead the public to think that the directors of those two agencies and a close advisor to the President would all be conspiring and killing people.<br />I didn't read DaVinci code, but from scanning some reviews on the Internet, it apparently suffers from many of the same problems as Deception Point.<br />I'm sure they'll both make great movies, but that's about all they're good for.
B000003B6J|3.0|Yeah this was the start of gangsta rap but it wasnt really that great. Dont get me wrong i like NWA but i think they did a lot better on their own. get the solo albums by dr dre eazy e and ice cube 1st.

PS will smith sux his music is pointless.
1400034779|4.0|Precious Ramotswe is a single, forty-something woman in Botswana who opens a detective agency with her inheritance.  In the beginning of the book we learn about her father's life as a miner and we are introduced to the country.  We also learn about Precious' upbringing, her head for figures and her failed marriage.  Precious struggles with establishing a new business, but she gets cases.  They are not all the typical detective story mysteries about malicious crimes.  Most are more concerned with the human heart and relationships between people.  There is a woman whose long lost father finds her, but she suspects that he is not really her father and is taking advantage of her kindness and generosity.  There is a woman who is upset that her husband stole a car and she wants the car returned without her husband's knowledge or the involvement of the police.  There is a father who believes his daughter has a boyfriend and he wants to know who the boy is.  There are a number of other cases and I enjoyed them all.  This was very easy-reading and not a complex detective story, but the setting was fun and the reading enjoyable.<BR> <BR>Recommended.
B00006690G|1.0|This guy sux lemme tell you why. 1 he hates his mom cuz shes a alcoholic and wants to kill her Tupacs mom was a crackhead and he made a song about how he loved her. 2 he hates his wife for no reason and wants to kill her too. 3 he raps about how britney spears n Nsync sux instead of havin a real beef like Nas and Jay z. 4 he complains his life was so hard even tho he grew up in a trailler park instead of the hood. 5 his fans r all white people like white girls who say ohh hes so cute white  guys who think hes the best rapper ever and hate all otha rap or oh wait dats it. 6  all otha rappers get criticized by the press for promotin violence and drugs when they talk about guns or killin the police cuz they been oppressed in the hood while he gets praise for sayin kill his mom and wife. 7 he sells 8 milion copies for these reasons while some good rappers dont even go platinum. Oh yeah and Watty when you gonna learn that all rock these days is repeated loops lyrics about skateboardin or gothic crap with suckey beats. Im done peace out white people

There's nothing that I can say that hasn't already been said about this album, just buy it and get to know the best album and the best band in the known universe.
B00005JLYW|5.0|\\"Charlie's Angels:  Full Throttle\\" reunites Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore as Natalie Cook, Alex Munday and Dylan Sanders for another fun romp to save the world.<br />THE STORY:<br />The Angels are called in to recover the stolen One Ring of Sauron (well, no actually), but they are called in to recover a stolen pair of power rings before they fall into the wrong hands.  Not too sure WHAT the rings were supposed to be able to do but the actual plotline of the movie was not its strong point.  In a moment of character development the girls also come to realize what true friendship is as changes in their lives threaten to break them apart.<br />THE COOL THINGS:<br />Like the first movie, the plot was simply a good excuse for the three ladies to get out into the world in their cool outfits, kick some booty girl power style and generally have fun.  Trust me, this movie was TONS of fun.<br />The action and undercover hijinks are WAAAY up from the first movie as it is obvious the girls are now comfortable in their roles and it is OBVIOUS they are having a blast out there.  The fight scenes and action sequences are more daring them the first movie and the pop culture parodies are even funnier than the last (including homages to MC Hammer and CSI!!!). <br />BEST SCENES:<br />1. CSI Parody Scene<br />2. `O Grady Wharehouse Battle<br />3. The Motocross Scene<br />4. The Final Battle<br />THE DVD Extras<br />Like the first disc and most new discs, Tri-Star and McG spared no expense here as you get a TRUCKLOAD of extras the explore the movie and make this disc a worthy addition to the collector's vault.<br />Here's what you get:<br />1. Two Audio Commentary Tracks:  1 featuring Director McG and the other featuring writers<br />2. Angel-Vision Trivia Track:  Cool feature found on more releases lately that you can play during the movie that gives you nifty factoids on the film<br />3. 8 Featurettes<br />a. \\"Pussycat Dolls\\" - 4 ½ minute feature detailing the filming of the strip club scene and the involvement of the infamous Pussycat Dolls troupe<br />b. \\"Rolling with the Punches\\" - 5 ½ minute feature on the fight choreography for the film<br />c. \\"XXX-Treme Angels\\" - 9 minute feature of the motocross scene and the pro-bikers involved<br />d. \\"Full Throttle\\" - 17 minute feature about the selection of the all the bikes and trucks that appeared in the film plus the Big Foot team<br />e. \\"Designing Angels\\" - Cool 7-minute feature of the wardrobe and lighting techniques used to highlight each actress<br />f. \\"There's No Such Thing As  Short Shot, Just an Overworked Producer\\" - 8 ½ minute feature on the challenges producing this ambitious film including the expenses and the trouble they had to go through to get some of the more spectacular (yet SHORT) scenes shown in the film<br />g. \\"Angel's Makeover:  Hanson Dam\\" - 4 minute look at the CGI and scale models that were needed to film the opening sequence in the film<br />h. \\"Dream Duds\\" - 3 minute slide showish feature showing off the actresses' various costumes and production sketches of them<br />4. Cameo-Graphy:  Fun facts and quick cuts to scenes featuring actors and other celebrities who made appearances in the film<br />5. Full Throttle Jukebox:  McG and the music director talk about how they selected the songs that appeared in the movie followed directly by those said scenes with the music in the background.  SOLID feature<br />6. Music Video:  \\"Feel Good Time\\" by Pink<br />7. Filmographies for the Cast and Crew<br />8. Trailers for Charlie's Angels I and II, Bad Boys II, Mona Lisa Smile, Something's Gotta Give, and S.W.A.T.<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Overall this was just a REAL fun film to watch.  The story was forgettable, but it wasn't really about the story.  The film was what it was, a simple fun 2 hour escape from reality featuring great action, beautiful girls in great costumes and an overall fun look at our lives through the pop culture pokes.  The DVD package outdid itselfas you get TONS of great extras.  Obviously a lot of love and fun went into this film and it shows.<br />Final Grades:<br />Movie:  4 stars<BR>Extras:  5 stars<br />Total:  4.5 stars<br />Highly Recommended
0684867184|5.0|I'm not a historian, but I am a son, and I have a father and many friends. This book, using his own life and his influential father as well as the lives of the Eisenhower boys, the Custer boys, Crazy Horse and He Dog, Eisenhower and Patton, and Nixon, poignantly and emotionally demonstrates the immense joy, satisfaction, and power that is to be had in the relationships that can only be shared between father and son and between two best friends. Reading Ambrose's heartfelt musings, I was often reminded of my own relationship with my father. I bought him one and he had the same reaction, thinking of both his father and me.<br />Having read the majority of Ambrose's works from which he pulled the short chapters for Comrades, I was perhaps even that much more moved by the essays. Using quick summaries and then providing insight gained from his years of research and life experience, Ambrose shows how the intimacy among friends and family drive can help drive us to much greater heights than would have been possible alone.<br />I strongly recommend this book.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Peter Jackson's talents as a film-maker were a revelation to most people who have seen his stunning Lord of the Rings Series. But I knew way back in 1994 when I saw his movie &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; that he was something special. The second instalment in the trilogy is an excellent film, a visual experience and part of a great story. <br />There are a few problems with the ocassional bouts of wooden acting, plus the dangerously camp relationship between Frodo and Sam. The most interesting sequences in the film center around Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. Pippin and Merry have their moments but the slowness of their scenes with Treebeard is too much of a contrast to the action taking place at Helms Deep. I found Gollum to be a bit ponderous, the comparison that one reviewer made to Jar Jar Binks is sadly apt. It is kind of mind boggling that Frodo would actually trust him, much less follow him anywhere, unless he was seriously thick. Indeed it must be said that those are the qualities that Elijah Wood imbues his character Frodo with. To be fair Jackson didn't really give Wood much to work with and one does have to wonder whether his scenes with Sam were written with the script-writer's tongue firmly planted in his cheek. The Orcs and the Uruk Hai are compelling but sadly given insufficient screen time. It would have been fantastic to get more of an insight into their world etc. <br />In all this is part of a great trilogy. Try not to mind that all the people of middle earth are white, as if no other races exist, or that you could build a raft with the acting. This is a great piece of film-making. If only Kate Winslet had been available instead of Liv Tyler, or if Tobey Maguire had played Frodo. Imagine even Denzel Washington as Aragorn (!!?). That said there are some nice performances from a few Australian actors. Hasn't Hugo Weaving come along since his turn as Douglas Jardine on the Aussie tv series &quot;Bodyline.&quot; David Wenham is a far cry from Diver Danfrom &quot;Seachange&quot; and Miranda Otto is the same girl from &quot;Love Serenade.&quot; Just think what would have happened if Claudia Karvan, Naomi Watts and Noah Taylor had turned up? Heck, Judy Davis could have played Frodo's mum .... Anthony LaPaglia could have played Saruman...There might have been some real acting. <br />Despite some of the glaring shortcomings Jackson has made a classic piece of Western cinema. But not a classic piece of world cinema ...
B00000F169|5.0|What's also amazing is the sensitivity to characters and personalities in this movie. Each crew member is different, and has his own unique coping mechanisms (or none at all) for the sheer boredom of space. <br />The ongoing diary of Bill Froop is a hilarious peek into one character's personal journey and transformation. You'll find a much more intriguing storyline here than in any of the last few Star Trek movies combined - unless you're a baby boomer reminiscing about your Half Moon Bay hippy commune days, that is.<br />Make a big batch of popcorn and settle in for a lot of fun!
B0000509C4|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I loved creepshow, I was somewhat dissapointed with this one. I bought a box set called 3 from the mind of Stephen King, just for this one. But I figured out that the other two (children of the corn and maximum overdrive) where alot better! anyways, the first story starts of with a wooden indian coming to life and seeking revenge. this story is called Ol' chief woodenhead. then next story is &quot;the raft&quot; this one is probably my favorite one of them all. its about four friends whose vacation to a lake turns into a nightmare! and the last story is about a lady who runs over a hitchiker and he comes back to life and haunts her. and by the way the creep looks nothing like he did in the first! Rated R for horror violence, language, and some nudity.

B00008CLOA|5.0|I'll spare the commentary on the albums well documented high artistic quality except to say this is one of the basic CDs anyone should have in their collection of music.<br />The SACD is definitely worth the expenditure of money. Even when played in CD mode you can hear the remastering's improvements. If this is the standard of what SACD re-issues will bring then the future of sales is bright indeed. The RIAA should stop the utterly stupid effort of suing its own fan base and direct itself towards encouraging re-mastered re-issues in the dual SACD/CD mode.<br />Here's hoping they release the whole Pink Floyd collection through The Wall on SACD and with the same dedication to quality.
0385504209|3.0|While this was a decent book, I found it lacking after Angels and Demons.  A&amp;D gripped me in a page-turning suspense with unseen twists.  DVC seemed like it was trying too hard to make a point, and followed a rather well-known and over-used suspense plot.  I was annoyed to be able to figure out most of the story well before the ending.<br />Also lacking in this book was the relationship between the Langdon and his lead woman.  It seems forced at the end and has very little throughout the story to imply anything should happen.  This is a huge disappointment after the portrayal of the perfect &quot;Indiana Jones-style&quot; lusting in A&amp;D.<br />While I would still (hesitantly) recommend this book, I would suggest being prepared for a disappointment after the first Robert Langdon journey, which I would highly recommend to anyone.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Metallica and a Symphionic Orchestra in the same place at the same time?? YOU BET!<br /> This is a great dvd to  have for all Fans and not fans of the band. <br /> Metallica doing what they know best... play fast, loud and agressive. <br /> The orchestral arrangements Michael Kamen did to  Metallica´s music are superb.<br /> The only grey spots  are two: They could have done  Fade To Black or Creeping Death instead of repeating Nothing Else Matters, wich its had been heard before  through the famous &quot;elavator version&quot; of the song. <br /> They summited the second verse of the song &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;  It was too much for the members of the orchestra to hear? They did &quot;Devil´s Dance&quot; wich is more direct than TTTSNB.
B000003S5H|4.0|The music in this CD is high quality stuff. Personaly, I find it too easy to digest and lack in shelf life. well, it is kninda pop, after all.
6305603847|2.0|I rented this DVD last nite... I have been a major Pink Floyd fan for several months now, and ever since listening to the wall, I had wanted to watch the film. I say film, because it would be wrong to call it a movie. There is no traditional dialouge, its more like i gigantic music video.<br />I am torn as to whether or not I even like this film. I love the album, love the music, and love the lyrics, but this film destroyed what I had imagined the story looking like, and left me with a very odd feeling.<br />At times I thought this film was wonderful, yet at the end of it I literally felt like I was gonna throw up in the bathroom. Certain images were spectacular, like the \\"Another Brick In The Wall, pt.2\\" scene. \\"Run Like Hell\\", however, was a bit too much for me to take, especially with the graphic depiction of a woman being raped by one of Pink's footsoldiers after he beats up the woman's boyfriend. This was not the only sexually explicit scene in the movie, for as any fan of the album knows, there is a whole section on dirty women... lots of breasts in that scene, and not to mention the hardcore depiction of Pink's cheating slut of a wife screwing her boyfriend.<br />The best parts of the movie were the animated ones, and for the live segments, Bob Geldof is perfect for the role with his satanically-good looks during the \\"In The Flesh\\" sequences, but as a whole I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and if they do see it, they should be prepared to be disturbed.

B0000YWKHC|5.0|Although \\"Lost in Translation\\" stars Bill Murray, it's not one of his mainstream comedies but an - often humorous - offbeat love story, or friendship story, or lost soul story. It's the fact that you end up not quite sure which that is a major part of its charm.<br />Longtime filmgoers may remember Richard Linklater's 1995 \\"Before Sunrise\\", which starred Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as an American man and a French girl who meet and develop a romantic relationship over the space of a few hours while he's backpacking through Europe. It's a film that I quite liked. But \\"Lost in Translation\\" is not only a similar movie. It's a better and more complex one. \\"Before Dawn\\" was sometimes a little too in love with its own wordiness.<br />Sofia Coppola's script for \\"Lost in Translation\\" is fairly minimalist, leaving plenty of room for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson to develop their relationship through a look, a gesture, a moment of silence. And then there are the added complications. Murray's character Bob Harris is facing a mid-life crisis. Johanssen's Charlotte is in her early to mid-twenties. Both are married.<br />Bob is a slightly over the hill actor who - he tells Charlotte - could be at home doing a play but is in Tokyo to do an ad for whisky for 2 million dollars. Charlotte is the wife of a fashion photographer, played by Giovanni Ribisi who's in town to do a shoot. Charlotte's been married two years, and is beginning to think she doesn't really know who her husband is. Bob has been married for 25 years and it's a marriage that seems to exist for the sake of the children. During their cross world phone calls neither he nor his wife seem to be very open with one another emotionally.<br />Both characters are jet-lagged and suffering from insomnia. In the early hours of the morning they find themselves sitting next to one another in the hotel bar, and they begin to get to know one another, something that probably would not have happened had they not been adrift, strangers in a strange land.<br />And to them at least Tokyo is a strange land. Charlotte feels the alienation of the outsider. Bob's cultural collisions are - as one would expect when Bill Murray is playing the character - somewhat more amusing. Some of them, notably a session shooting photographs for the whiskey campaign, are ad-libbed by Murray and the Japanese cast. In another scene a Japanese prostitute sent to his room by his gracious hosts won't take no for an answer, and seems determined that he should lick her tights or lip her tights. It takes him a while to catch on.<br />A Japanese character nicknamed Charlie Brown singing the Sex Pistols \\"God Save the Queen\\" in a karaoke bar, does - after all -have potentially humorous overtones. And the film's not any less satirical in its portrayal of many of the Western characters, including a Western lady jazz singer in the hotel bar, a Hollywood actress in Japan to promote an action movie in which she co-starred with Keanu Reeves, or even Bob himself. One encounter between Bob and the jazz singer, and its after-effects, are simultaneously stinging, funny and poignant.<br />Bob stays in Tokyo a few extra days to appear on an absurd TV chat show. Charlotte is left alone as her husband leaves town for a shoot. They begin to hang out together. They begin to realise that despite the age difference, and their different places in life they are experiencing very similar self-doubts. And they like each other. A lot. But where are they going to go with it? I'm not going to give much of that away, but it's an extremely sensitive portrayal of a budding relationship between what is - in some ways only - an odd couple.angers in a strange land. <br />And to them at least Tokyo is a strange land.

B00006V9A0|2.0|This CD is alright if you are just getting into Nirvana.  Then again there are people out there who feel like Smells Like Teen Spirit is Nirvanas best song, so maybe this album is good for them.  The truth of the matter is these are all songs you can find on other CD's.  Except for &quot;You Know Your Right&quot;, but there is a good reason for that not being on any of the CD's (Kurt Hated it!).  This is essentially a plot for COurtney Love to make more money.  Do not support this CD!  Buy Bleach, In Utero, Incesticide or find some cool bootlegs.  Dont wate your time with this one.
B00018D44U|4.0|If *only* Vienna Teng's sophomore album hadn't also come out around the same time, NJ might have escaped unscathed by comparison.

6305949980|5.0|Clay, Ghosts made of bugs, ghost dogs, skeltons doing hamlet, Halloween time, and the worlds greatest director. What more do i have to say?
B0001ENY6M|5.0|First off I have to say this.  For those who are bashing the movie as being historically inaccurate, that comment is inaccurate.  Whatever your religious beliefs are, the fact is that Mel Gibson took over ten years to make this movie, for the most part because he wanted it to be as accurate as possible.  The man is a devout Catholic and though I am not Catholic, the \\"truths\\" are universal and are historically accurate.  Yes, he did take some creative lisence, which he admitted to, but he did not alter history.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  For those who have not seen the movie yet, but have heard the comments about Gibson and the movie being anti-Semitic, this is SO not even close to being true.  I have many Jewish friends, all who have seen it and said that it was not anti-Semitic in any way and I, myself would have been the first person to admit that it was, if in fact it was.  I have to give him cudos for having not only the guts to make such a movie when all of Hollywood was laughing in his face, saying it would flop, no one would go to see a movie spoken entirely in Aramaic and Latin with subtitles, etc., but for also having the integrity and heart to make a masterpiece that is the greatest \\"Jesus\\" film of all time.  To those of us who know the truth in our hearts, that is enough.  I am not a bible thumper or zealot by any means, but I was sobbing throughout the entire movie and for hours afterwards.  If you are one of those people that didn't like the movie or thought it was overrated, all I can ask you is, are you completely dead inside?!  I'm sure others will respond angrily to this comment, but maybe you ought to think as to why it didn't affect you as it has most of the masses.<br />As to the music, yes, it is fairly reminiscent of The Last Temptation of Christ.  But many parts of Gladiator were too.  So what?!  The music is indigenous - sound-wise, to not only the genre of the movie, but to the land they were in as well.  Middle Eastern music and music that is often associated with movies like this, tend to have a certain sound/feel to them.  The music was beyond appropriate for the film and was the perfect accent to the movie.  Yes, many of the instruments were not from the Holy Land, but that doesn't mean those instruments were not played during that time.  People migrated from all over.  Last Temptation had synthesizers, so should we crucify Peter Gabriel for that?!  Holy cow....unbelievable!<br />What it boils down to is, the music is hauntingly beautiful, the movie, if you have any kind of heart and conscious will move you beyond mere words or experience can relate.  It doesn't matter what religion you are or even if you have no religious convictions at all.  If you have any kind of heart, you will be completely moved by this film.  It saddens me to read such infantile comments that bash either the music or the film or both, when there are so many other important things in this world getting your panties in a wad over.  But then again, I can see how it would not even come close to comparing with such masterpieces as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Rambo, Die Hard 48 or any other \\"gore\\" movies that so many people think are akin to having a religious experience.  Yeah right.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Not as if it's hard to make it &quot;Their worst album...&quot; considering they only have two, but it gets my vote, regardless.  I hate comparing APC to Tool, but honestly, if you like Tool, you'll like this album.  I do.  <br />But, if you like Tool, however you feel A Perfect Circle should try to distance themselves from the kinda artsy, ambient tone that Tool embraces, you'll be disappointed.  I was.<br />This album pales in comparison to Mer De Noms on so many different levels.  I liked Mer De Noms because it was a chance to listen to Maynard use his gift for a more solid act, and step out of the dark, mysterious position he'd made for himself in Tool, and just sing some beautifully orchestrated rock songs. <br />For one, Maynard had a lot more input into these songs than the last, and, whether his intention or not, just turns APC into another Tool.  Yes, Tool fans, shame me for saying it, but Maynard's input - from what I can gather - really drowned out this record.  He should stick to what he does best: Tool, and let Billy brilliantly craft this work, like he did their last.  He'll do fine.  He's just as talented, but in a different way.<BR>In my opinion, I feel this is just another &quot;weird, art-rock, bliss, ambient&quot; record that I could listen to Tool and get the same feeling, but in odd time signatures.  In fact, Danny Carey is probably the only thing missing from this album that doesn't make it a full-fledged Tool record (kudos to Josh Freese, though...he's a marvelous drummer).<br />Is it a good record?  Yes.  The first three songs are great.  Then it get's kind of boring for me.  I'd rather they kept with the same pace, and expanded the sound of their first record, rather than mellowing down for their sophomore effort.  It's blasphemy in the &quot;Tool Fan Kingdom&quot; to make some sort of falliable image of any of them.  SOME Tool fans are partially the reason, I've been turned off to the band the last year or so.  Trust me, I used to be that sort of Tool fan that, felt they could do no wrong, and that they were beyond some human level.  But they're not, and so I say again that Maynard should keep his input to a minimum with this band.  He does much better with Tool
B000000OQY|4.0|Even though this isn't a normal album, I've always really liked it. The first 4 tracks are live and from 1986, pre-&quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot;, and are pretty raw rockers. Good stuff though. The last 4 tracks on side two (I have it on vinyl), are from 1988, and are unplugged. All 4 are great, including the hit &quot;Patience&quot;, but I really like &quot;Used To Love Her&quot; and &quot;One In A Million&quot;. I think the cover is a cool idea too. This is a must for fanatics, but casual fans will probably be happy with their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.
B00000JPHF|5.0|This movie classic was the best for its time.. Just imagine what it must of been like being at Radio City Music Hall when this film first came to the big screen.Boris Korloff, was the greatest movie monster of all time. James Whale was a genius.
B000006NPY|5.0|When I first got this album I didn't like it at all.  I liked track 3 and thats it.<br />Within a day it grew on me so I liked tracks: 1, 2, &amp; 3.<br />Within a week I liked: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, &amp; 13<br />Then by the next week, this album was all perfect.  I sincerly enjoyed this album and I cannot see how people, if they give it a couple of listens, won't like.  In my opinion, it was better than Siamese Dream and comes VERY close to Mellon Collie.<br />This is my second favorite album of all time, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for depth in their music.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Hundreds of thousands of people gather around in huge circules to watch as millions of VHS and DVD copies of this movie are burnt into piles of carbon.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is without doubt one of the most original films ever made.If you plan to actually live rather than just exist you should watch this film. This is film that you must come at with a very open mind, if you dont you will hate it.<BR>This is a film for people who like to step outside the circle, for people who arent satisfied by just another blockbuster, not that i hate those i thought that Pirates of the Carribean was one of the best films of last year I even rank it alonside my favourite of last year Kill Bill, and thats saying a lot as I preach to anyone that listens. Just ask my fellow horseman and Amazon reviewer The Birdman.<BR>But seriously see this film or else your world will end on an empty and sad note.
B000003S0I|5.0|this line up makes music ahead of their times...<br />any lovers of new king crimson like &quot;the power to believe&quot; will fall in love with this music. i call this album a prog-energetic-rock!!!<br />the booklet is good too.
B00009V7T2|5.0|WOW! THIS IS TRULY THE BEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD. FROM THE MOMENT YOU POP THIS INTO YOUR CD PLAYER YOU GET SUCKED INTO THE WORLD CREATED BY THIS CONCEPT OF OVERDOSING AND TRAVELING TO TRIPPY PLACES. THE LYRICS ARE GREAT AND THE GUITARS ARE AMAZING. D-LitC IS FULL OF FAST PACED GUITARS, PAINFUL CRIES, AND SUDDEN RYTHYM CHANGES THAT WILL KNOCK YOUR PANTS OFF. EVER SINCE I BOUGHT THIS CD, KNOWING NOTHING ABOUT THEM OTHER THAN WHAT I HAD READ IN A MAGAZINE, IVE WANTED TO KNOW THE STORY BEHIND THE GROUP AND THIS MIND BENDING ALBUM. THE CONCEPT IS KIND OF HARD TO GRASP ONTO AT FIRST BUT I PROMISE NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF MUSIC YOU ARE INTO, IF YOU BUY THIS CD YOU WILL LOVE IT FROM THE FIRST SONG AND FOREVER BE A FAN OF THE MARS VOLTA!!!
B00006RINF|5.0|If I hear one more person compare Lacuna Coil to Evanescence...I'll puke.<BR>Evanescence is for the &quot;newbie&quot; MTV type of teenage &quot;emo&quot; kids.Not for the golden goth heads of yesterday! EMO is what I called &quot;goth&quot; when I was a teen. GET A NEW TITLE!<BR>I have seen Lacuna Coil twice and they are even better live!<BR>after owning many many goth albums, including Autumn, The Gathering,T.O.N.,2 Witches etc. they have to be the most unbelievable out of the bunch.<BR>&quot;swamped&quot; with pound you ears with the most beautiful sonic therapy courtesy of Christina. Aside from being absolutely STUNNING she has a very cosmic voice that makes you want to melt. Having her vocals backed up by a man is nice, it breaks up the feelings that they drive into you and makes you want more!<BR>If you ever heard anything from Autumn, and are looking for something with a nice womanly touch, pick up anything from this group. You will not be dissapointed!
B0001AP12G|4.0|THIS ALBUM IS IN HEAVY ROTATION IN MY CD PLAYER. KANYE IS AN AMAZING PRODUCER AND AN OK RAPPER. I LOVE THE SONG SPACESHIP. THIS SONG SPEAKS TO THOSE OF US WORKING JOBS WE HATE, BUT STILL STRIVING TO FIND OUR WAY TO OUR TRUE CALLING. <br />ALL FALLS DOWN IS ANOTHER GEM ON THE ALBUM, WHICH SPEAKS ON HOW MATERIALISTIC THE MAJORITY OF US HAVE GOTTEN. <br />LAST CALL IS ANOTHER FAVORITE! KANYE SCHOOLS US ON HIS RISE TO FAME. <br />ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE AN INSTANT CLASSIC, (I.E. READY TO DIE OR ILLMATIC)IT IS ONE OF THE BETTER ALBUMS TO DROP WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS!
0689835604|5.0|I purchased this book as I was setting up my daughter's nursery library before she was born. I was immediately attracted to the simplicity of the text, strong construction, and big, brightly colored, eye-catching illustrations. I began reading it to my daughter at age 4 months.  She is now 10 months old and absolutely loves this book! When she sees me take it out of her closet her eyes light up and she literally squeals with delight. We read it at least 5 times each night. She now is able to lift the flaps on the book and anticipates the ending question, \\"Where is baby?\\". I am just about to purchase the entire collection of books written and illustrated by Karen Katz for my daughter's 1 year birthday. She is a brilliant author and illustrator. This book is a must have for any baby/child.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|From what I recall it deserves a five star rating. I watched this in French class and I remember thinking oh boy another sucktastic school movie and was pleasently suprised. <br />At first I doodled, but you can't help but be pulled into the story and the delightful Meg Ryan. I soon was completely involved with storyline and loved every minute of it, and I for once didn't even mind the pretictable ending.<br />A movie that is worth renting, watching, and then purchasing. Enjoy.
B00005JLYW|1.0|This movie reaches the level of OMG bad.  Save your time, watch something else or read a book.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is an outstanding artist with an amazing talent.  He has the drive and the vision to be one of the best of all time.  This album shows his range of talent in producing and raping.  He will change the way people listen to hip-hop and the popularity of it will exspand.  He is truly a great artist and this album describes why.
B0000028VT|5.0|It's no surprise that this album is a hit.  Two very strong singles backed up by an intimate, beautiful cover song is what makes an album a delight.  Here's a detailed song review:<br />1)  Dreamlover:  one of her #1 singles.  A fantastic upbeat song that is self explanatory.<BR>2)  Hero:  I'm sure almost every single person knows this song.  It's such an amazing, strong song about finding one's self and making it through the tough times.<BR>3)  Anytime You Need A Friend:  This is a wonderful song to play for a friend who is having trouble in their life or is about to move away.  It's got touching lyrics.<BR>4)  Music Box:  One of the slower songs, I love the vocals in this song so much because the songs main focus ARE the vocals.  The piano is a very nice touch.<BR>5)  Now That I Know:  A faster song, great beat and catchy lyrics.  More pop than R&amp;B but still very Mariahish.  I think every girl experiences this kind of emotion where your friends tell you the guy is no good but he proves them wrong.<BR>6)  Never Forget You:  Though a great song, it's probably my least favourite on the disc.  Even though vocals ARE up to pitch and the music is great, I just don't find it as intriguing as the others.<BR>7)  Without You:  Now here's the amazing cover song.  When I was little, I listened to this version so many times it got worn out.  So I was so incredibly happy when I heard this knowing this song would never leave my heart.<BR>8)  Just To Hold You Once Again:  If I had a movie, this song would definitely be on the soundtrack.  Everyone experiences this after a break up.  Great lyrics for after a breakup and you want the guy back.<BR>9)  I've Been Thinking About You:  Another one of the upbeat, faster songs.  The lyrics are really good and the vocals are amazing.  Obvious Mariah song.<BR>10)  All I've Ever Wanted:  The album ends with the perfect ballad.  EVERYONE and ANYONE can relate to this song.<br />In all, I think this album is great for when you break up orwhen you find someone you truly love.  It's a mixture of both emotions.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B0000CFW87|1.0|Celine dion must've had a sex change. this trite and mushy compilation falsely regarded as virtuosic contains no evidence of virtuosity but yet another version of a common though mildy trained tenor voice with no real originality and perhaps anyone that is not tone deaf can sing as well as josh groban and the only reason vocalists such as him earn acclaim is because they have the need to be in the spotlight. honestly, there is a million of R&B and soul vocalists with more advanced harmonizations and conceptions of melodic structure. But who cares, he has curly hair and can cleanly hold a note for a measure or two.
B000002AVF|5.0|&quot;Daydream&quot; by Mariah Carey is personally one of Mariah's best albums to date.  This collection of beautifully written songs is not only filled with Mariah's signature ballads but has great beats.  This is the first album where Mariah started adding in some hip hop flavour.  It isn't a surprise we find Mariah singing her heart out on songs such as 'Melt Away' and 'Forever', nor was it a surprise to see the album contain the happy upbeat love song 'Always Be My Baby' but there were 2 songs that showcased a new and different Mariah.  Firstly, 'Fantasy', the opening song features ODB (who is focused on more so in the remix).  This was Mariah's first song where she expanded into the hip hop field.  The second shocker was the last song, 'Looking In', an in depth look at how Mariah truly feels.  The song describes how people judge her about her fame.  Mariah's self titled debut or this album are probably the best albums to pick up if you are a first time Mariah listener/fan in my opinion because both albums show who Mariah is.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I have to say I usually hate movies that have been adapted from great literary works.  This is a HUGE exception.  This film captured the wonder of Middle Earth.  It brought to life the battles that were so amazing when reading the book.  Although Jackson took a few liberties with the adaptation and rearranged it a little, it didn't make too much of a difference.  A must have for any fan of the books!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Ok OK to start off i'm just so happy that Kanye put out an album after hearing him on a bunch of mixtapes and features. When i first heard 'Champions' off of the Dream Team album i was like \\"damn this dude can really spit\\". Then when i heard 'Through the wire' i couldnt wait for his album to finally drop. i could tell this guy has more to say than most hip hop artist in the past few months, dont get me wrong Jay-z has dope flows too but its like hip hop needed a change from all the beef thats been goin on. all the unecessary beefs. Though the album is solid from begining to end, i feel like some of the skits shouldnt really be there. Maybe a lot of the people that bought this album would agree that too many skits on an album is just a waste of album space, but he makes up for it with the songs he does. ok my own own personal rating system goes like this, 10 means 'its really off the chain' and 1 of course means 'wow what happened'. i wont be rating the skits cuz why would anyone do that.<BR>1.Intro (skit)<BR>2.We dont care (9/10) good first song to start off the album<BR>3.Graduation day (7/10) i couldnt tell if it was a skit or a song<BR>4.All falls down (10/10) really a fav of mine <BR>5.I'll fly away (skit)<BR>6.Spaceship (8/10) very good catchy choures<BR>7.Jesus walks (10/10) another fav of mine and deep as well<BR>8.Never let me down (10/10) Kanye and Jay rip hard on this<BR>9.Get high (10/10) You just gotta listen to it, cant explain, just CRAZY!! <BR>10.Workout plan (skit)<br />11.The new workout plan (10/10) very ill, very ill<BR>12.Slow jamz (10/10) no need to explain<BR>13.Breathe in Breath out (9/10) i thought Luda would do more<BR>14.School spirit skit 1<BR>15.School spirit (9/10) something you would see i him perform at a college show<BR>16.School spirit skit 2<BR>17.Lil jimmy skit<BR>18.2 words (10/10) Kanye, Mos and Free good stuff<BR>19.Through the wire (10/10) cmon now<BR>20.Family business (10/10) a really nice song w/ good sample and just something you can listen to with your fam<BR>21.Last call (10/10) the longest song the album, damn its like 12 mins. long but still good<BR>* do you agree that the skits may take away from the album? but still very solid *
076790592X|4.0|I could only hope that when I get to the end of my life, I have half of the insight that Morrie had.  I found this book to be a very quick read but the lessons held within to be wonderful and so easy to apply to life. If you ever need to read something that is life-affirming, this is the book.  Beautifully written to capture the last days of this wonderful human's life.
B000005Z0G|5.0|An album full of hard beats, explicit lyrics and a man on the mic who has just about had enough of life and the way things are. Causing controversy left, right and centre after this release, Tupac Shakur was straight under the spotlight and was seen as one of the main representatives of the gangsta rap evolution that was overtaking the charts by not just himself, but fellow rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr Dre and the rest of Suge Knight's Death Row clique.<br />Although mainly an album full of frustration and restlessness heard on favoured tracks such as 'Holla If Ya Hear Me', 'Point Tha Finga' and the furious 'Last Wordz' (featuring Ice Cube and Ice T), Tupac does show his softer side on the inspiring and spirit lifting single release 'Keep Ya Head Up' and his comical sexual conquests on 'I Get Around', a great party track for 1993, but the violence returns on 'Streetz R Death Row' with lines like '... my homie lost his family and snapped / shot up half the block to bring him back...'. His final expression of anger is at his father on 'Papaz Song' a sad yet angry tale told by Tupac how his father left with him believing he's dead.<br />As explosive as this album may be, it remains as one of Tupac's best. Compare to his '2Pacalypse Now' debut, 'Strictly...' concentrates less on his political views and more on current issues involving the streets and the violence within them. A consistent album, which is hard to find these days, and makes this a worth while listen. This is Tupac at his rawest - 16 tracks of 100% pure gangsta rap.
B00005JKJA|1.0|There was no car chases or big explosions. Very bad movie. The ending was not that happy either and it was not a real feel good movie. Where was the hero? Or the love story. Not as good as a Sandra Bullock movie.
1573228737|5.0|Having already read and fallen in love with Waters' first novel &quot;Tipping the Velvet,&quot; I must admit I expected more of the same when I picked up &quot;Affinity.&quot;  Boy, was I wrong!<br />Waters has proven herself as a masterful storyteller, crafting tales that draw the reader in and do not let go.  I found myself reading at all hours of the day and night, unable to stop turning the pages, absolutely absorbed in the tale unfolding before me.  As I read this novel, I found myself falling in love with Selina Dawes, my heart broken by the dark story behind Margaret Prior's stint as a Lady Visitor, and so desperate to know what happens that by the end my head was spinning.  My husband sat and just watched me read, my reactions so visceral that I was gripping the book, grimacing in ache and surprise as the story unfolded, and breathing raggedly, wildly, as I rushed headlong to the astounding ending.<br />This is not your run-of-the-mill mystery, gothic or otherwise.  It is sensual, dark and entrancing, and I highly recommend &quot;Affinity&quot; to anyone looking for a good yarn.  I have &quot;Fingersmith&quot; waiting to be read, but am enduring a torturous wait before diving into it, desperate to know what fabulous tale Ms. Waters has prepared for me, but painfully aware that once I have devoured it, there will be no more to sate my desire for this woman's fabulous work...  And so I wait...
B00018D44U|1.0|This is an Enhanced Compact Disc (ECD), which means there is a mix of data and music files on the disc.  An ECD is not a compliant Compact Disc under the Philips standard (as evidenced by the lack of the Compact Disc logo on the CD and CD case). It should play on most CD players, but not all (it won't on my Aiwa ACD-300).<br />Note that Amazon will not refund your purchase if it doesn't play on your CD player.
0345440900|2.0|The EASY plan has actually worked quite well for my 10 week old son, so far.  I think, perhaps, this is because he tends to get hungry every three hours, so the routine fits in with what he would normally do anyway.<br />What I really could not bear is Hogg's tone.  She uses some of the most patronizing language I've read in any parenting book (i.e. &quot;that dreadful swing&quot;).  Her anecdotes seemed contrived, if not completely fictional.  They're more self-congratulatory than anything else, allowing her to demonstrate time and again that these poor lost parents would simply continue down the road to domestic failure if she hadn't appeared.  <br />A friend had recommended &quot;The Happiest Baby on the Block&quot; by Dr. Harvey Karp and I found this truly essential in calming the baby during his first weeks.  To his her own, I guess...but I can't recommend Hogg...too much ego.
B000067J1H|5.0|Is this the best film ever made? Well, probobaly not, but it's definetely one of them.<BR>I saw this film a few years ago on a friends wide screen T.V. The mood was right. We were all alone for the whole night (The first time a bunch of us had had a sleepover without the unnessacery disadvantage of parents) and although it was a Sunday our minds were at ease since it was a holiday the next day and no school would follow. I swear by this film, the two hours and fifteen minutes before it began, I was to some extent a different person.<BR>I'm sure that it had lessons that were just around the corner for me anyway, but this just happened to be the way that I discovered them. (I was only 14).<BR>This film is not for stupid people. Although I'm sure that there is a hint of vanity in that comment I still mean every bit of it. If your into brand names and conformity then this film will do one of two things. Insult you beyond your wildest dreams to the extent were you will stop watching it and go around telling everyone what a crappy film it is (that makes you a stupid person) or it will open your eyes and make you think differently about life and opportunities all together.<BR>Don't get me wrong, It is possible that the film just won't do it for you. You may say it's stating the obvious, the point that it's trying to make is too vague and is not put across properly with a bunch of guys beating on each other night after night. And thats perfectly fine. If you didnt like it then you didnt like it. Just don't start telling people that it's crap when you know full well that it's not.<BR>Anyway, maybe I'm going a little over over the top with the whole life changing experience thing, but if you havent seen it then there's only one way to find out whether I am or not.<BR>I saw it for the twentieth time recently (Sad I know but that is during a period of over three years) and I'm still noticing new things. For example when Tyler checks his teeth after throwing Jack through the rearview mirror, that represents how thoughts such as vanity are slowly creeping back into him. No matter how far you go you will always come back to your old roots eventually. (There that's for all you people who say that it portrays nothing but that we should all give up on life and call it a day.)<BR>Like in so many of these reviews I'm beginning to ramble, so I'll finish by saying that if you havent seen it yet then do yourself a favour and get hold of it.<BR>And if it doesn't get you within the first five minutes, then you might as well turn it off.
B00007K02F|4.0|I would highly recommend this as a great movie in itself rather than an accurate depiction of the book. Although it strays a little and there are large key parts missing, it's cleverly brought together and both Hurt and Gainsbourg do a fantastic job of creating the true demeanor of Erye and Rochester.
6304779607|3.0|This movie lingers between the lines of being the worst movie ever made, and the funniest.<BR>Don't get me wrong on this, the film is crap, no dought about it, the film is crap, but it will have you in hysterics from beginning to end. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense but you don't really care, it's full of some of the stupidest things I've ever seen (Like when the bad guy dies his hair black. Like it really makes any difference to a guy as hefty as that.He looked exactly the same.)<BR>Basically you can't go on about it for too long but it's worth renting if your looking for a comedy that will really make you laugh out loud.<BR>Saying that I would love to see the directors commentary. He might be as funny as the film itself?
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Owning all of The Beatles' albums, and having listened to every song they released, this CD is very good, but it is only an introduction to the great music this band produced. Since this is a collection of only number 1 hit singles, it does not have any material from Sgt. Pepper, Rubber Soul, and the &quot;White Album.&quot; Also, why is &quot;Love Me Do&quot; (no. 17) on here and not &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (no. 1)? Still a great introduction!<br />If I were to create a Beatles greatest hits package, this is what I would put on it:<br /> 1. Love Me Do<BR> 2. Please Please Me<BR> 3.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Everyone can usually pick out the handful of albums that really broke away from the pack and defined a genre. You have albums like Led Zep II, Van Halen I, Sabbath's Paranoid, Boston, Ride The Lightening ... you get the picture. Reign In Blood took metal to the next brutal step when they released this album. I bought this album the first week it came out. And it just blew everything metal away. After this everyone had to start playing catch-up. It defined speed metal, and to this day, almost twenty years later, it's still as good as anything out there. Easily in the top 5 metal albums of all time.<br />Dave Lombardo is probably the best metal drummer I've ever heard. His drumming on the album set a new standard for metal drummers and within two years all speed metal drummers were copying him. Kerry King plays rhythm as well as anyone, but I've never been all that crazy about Jeff Hanneman's disjointed leads. But at least they're not distracting on this album.<br />BTW, I don't think Slayer came close to matching this until they put out God Hates Us All. But I still have to give Reign the nod as their best. And certainly their most innovative.<br />If you truly think you like metal but don't like this ... then you really don't have a taste for metal. May I suggest Barry Manilow instead.
B00008RV1L|5.0|Just wanted to get something off my chest. Those who have reviewed this film and commented that it is NOT an insight into the mind of a serial killer need to do some more research.<BR>We are only now starting to understand the psychopathic condition and discover what motivates one to become a serial killer. This film's portrayal of Bateman as an empty shell, a man on the outside with nothing inside is very accurate. Psychopaths do not have the social skills or moral limitations that &quot;normal&quot; people do. They have to learn these things in order to &quot;fit in&quot; as Bateman says. Otherwise they would be as obviously different as an alien life form. When Patrick says that we might be able to see him and hear him but &quot;I simply do not exist&quot;, I think this is the clearest, most insightful comment on a psychopathic personality that I have ever seen in a movie.
B00005T7HG|2.0|I've tried to watch this film several times, but I always abandon it about halfway through, from either boredom, or Madonna's irritating warbling. I finally decided to really try and get through the whole thing, and....I just can't. Madonna is probably a nice lady. She's made some very danceable songs. But, she cannot act, and, she does not have the vocal chops to pull off this role. She certainly should be credited for possessing an abundance of confidence, and she looks convincing as Eva Peron. But, it is obvious she was chosen for her popularity. This is one of those cases where they put together popular stars, big budget, and all the ingredients that should make a great film, and, they made a boring one. I really don't know who they should have chosen to play Evita, but, they needed an actress with skill, soul, and a great voice, and instead, they chose the Pop Tart Of The Century. Admit it, it may not be totally lousy, but, it should have been a whole lot better. The film that does the play justice has yet to be made.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown is a magical thriller. Brown pulls you through his well written book by shifting plots frequently. He keeps you wondering, who is the next target, what is going on over there, or when will these situations fall together?<br />Brown's manner of writing, itself, is enough to claim and hold your interest. The short chapters keep you thinking where he could go next in his amazing story. Robert Langdon, a professor and writer, and Sophie Neveu, a cryptographer, must decipher the codes given to them from the scene of a murder in the Louvre, the famous museum and home to the Mona Lisa.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who has a few spare days and is in the mood for this fast-paced thriller. You will catch yourself searching for answers to the puzzle in books, on the internet, and from random people or close friends. I really enjoyed Brown's brisk-paced storyline and hope you do the same.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|If your not a Bruce Campbell or Sam Raimi fan this &quot;B&quot; movie will either annoy you or turn you into a fan. The people who wrote bad reviews on this movie turned down the wrong road when they thought they were getting into a high budget carbon copy horror film.  This is not &quot;The Matrix&quot; or &quot;Star Wars&quot;, it was made in 1983 with a very small budget.  I would reccomend renting this film before buying it if you're not already a fan.<br />Bruce Campbell's one liners make the whole Evil Dead trilogy worth watching.
B00004Y6RO|4.0|A lot of people who reviewed this album seem to think that Slipknot are a bunch of &quot;posers&quot; who don't even hold a candle to their favorite death metal bands.  I have to disagree in this accusation because I think that Slipknot have actually created an album that sets an example for hardcore bands and shows them that you can have fast and angry music without losing all sense of a band's togetherness.<br />  Most death metal I listen to starts with a strong intro, but falls into the same monotony of banging on drums and playing (can you call it playing?) the guitar as fast as they can.  Throw into the mix a vocalist who probably couldn't actually sing to save his life (some actually can, but it confuses me why they don't).  What you end up with is a mess of unintelligible crap that you can't even make enough sense out of to headbang to.<br />  What Slipknot has achieved is to take the attitude of death metal and still remain accessible to the general public.<br />  I think this album is great to listen to buy if you want something to listen to when you're mad but still want something that's entertaining and intelligible.
B00006690G|4.0|i dont know where to strart from! This is album is the best! <BR>I bought the Marshall Mathers LP and I was disspointed all right! So before buying this one I thought a lot! But now that I own the album i m proud to have it!<br />It's a shame that alot of reviews are bad and saying that we dont like it cuz he is WHITE! Don't go for the skin color! This guy got the balls to say whatever u can't! And there is nothing wrong with funny lyrics with his angry voice! <br />From the start to finnish, this album will keep u entertain! Intro is just basic intro! 2nd track White America is about how people can die for America! 3rd one is just an OK song! Nowk from the 4th track, album changes and u just can't skip one song! Cleaning Out My Closet is a wonderful song! After that all songs are good! Some worth mentioning are: &quot;Without ME&quot;, &quot;Sing for the Moment&quot;, Superman, &quot;Haile's Song&quot; and &quot;My Dad's gone crazy&quot;! <br />Buy this album and again, don't go for the skin color!
B00008973Q|2.0|Yes, it was the 50s classic Japanese director Akira Kurosawa coming back to make a final color epic.  But unfortunately, magic doesn't always strike the second time around.  This film is just flat; it shows you how much Toshiro Mifune really meant to Kurasawa.    <br />Kurosawa's great weakness was his misogyny, an apparently utter disdain or fear of females.  He seemed to seek out stories where evil women or unfaithful women existed as the curse of man.  Here at his advanced age, Kurosawa seems to have felt free to come completely out of the closet, living vicariously through the character of the feminized court jester.  Even at this mature stage of his life, Kurosawa shows an amount of understanding of and sympathy for the plight of women that one would expect to find in a in a confused teenage boy.  <br />If you want to experience the classic Japanese films era at its apex, watch Seven Samurai, Hidden Fortress, Rashomon, Sansho the Bailiff, &amp; Tokyo Story.  This film is OK, but for me it sullens the memory of the films of that great era.

My party stands for those who are successful, Christian minded, and controlling those who want to hurt American business.<br />- First of all, how dare you oppose Bush in not supporting of the glorious war and Crusade against non-Christian infidels? What's all this bull about WMDs? Saddam killed, so we killed, might makes right in any sensible mind. So all those who are against Bush are going to hell.<br />- Democrats are all renegade swine, quite frankly, and it's a crying shame they are even allowed to vote. Jesus would have supported Bush in his war against muslim sheep and cutting funds for people who are disabled, crippled, retarded, old, etc. It's their own fault, Bush didn't make these losers the way they are.<br />- So Bush didn't win the popular election; God wanted him to be President, God didn't trust the 'popular majority' and God wanted a military hero like Bush in office. Thank God for our unbiased Supreme Court.<br />- Furthermore, how dare you show narrow-minded animosity at Bush when he is a self made man. Don't believe those who say the US doesn't have enough jobs. If the Mexicans can find jobs, so can you. Republicans get better jobs because we know the game, know how to take advantage of the system, and because of our Godly contacts.<br />You should buy Anne Coulter books instead. She is the leading spokeswoman for the Republican party because she knows and speaks our truth. Quotes from her:<br />* &quot;I think [women] should be armed but should not [be allowed to] vote...women have no capacity to understand how money is earned. They have a lot of ideas on how to spend it....it's always more money on education, more money on child care, more money on day care.&quot;-- Politically Incorrect, 2/26/01<br />* &quot;...a cruise missile is more important than Head Start.&quot;-- Speech, 11/01, rebroadcast by C-Span in Jan. 2002<br />* &quot;In his brief fiery ride across the landscape, Joe McCarthy bought America another thirty years. For this, he sacrificed his life, his reputation, his name. The left cut down a brave man, but not before the American people heard the truth.&quot;-- The Drudge Report, quoting from Coulter's new book, Treason, 6/19/03<br />* &quot;We hate them. Americans don't want to make Islamic fanatics love us. We want to make them die. There's nothing like horrendous physical pain to quell anger. A couple of well-aimed nuclear weapons will get our opposition out of the way.&quot;-- Column, 9/25/02<br />* &quot;We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.&quot;-- Column, 9/13/01<br />* &quot;We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed, too. Otherwise, they will turn out to be outright traitors.&quot;-- Speech to Conservative Political Action Conference, January 2002<br />* &quot;Soldiers are just cowards with their backs against the wall.

B00008EY7H|3.0|What I liked about Alegria was the wonderful costuming and the beautiful voice of Franchesca Gagnon. However, as far as the other Cirque performances go, I have to rate this one as somewhat lacking.<br />Personally, I think a bit too much time was spent with the clowns. While an important part of Cirque's charm, it takes away time from the acts. It seemed to me that there were less acts than in most Cirque performances and to me they appeared a bit less polished than what I'm used to seeing in this series.<br />On the good side, though, there were a few outstanding acts such as the tumblers and a Hawaiian fire dancer. The strong man was especially intriguing and well presented.<br />While entertaining, I'd still recommend Quidam and Dralion to first time Cirque watchers.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I saw &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; once in the cinema. I've watched the DVD five times. If you wonder why, it's probably because the film isn't long enough. To those who think the film slow I'd like to ask them how fast their lives are? This film isn't slow. It's just that the things that happens need you to look for them. It's not all out there. It's not all put into words. And I'm so happy for that. If you've seen the French flic called &quot;The Green Ray&quot; you'll know how rewarding a slightly meandering story can be. <br />Anyhow, by comparison there's a lot going on in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, brilliantlyconveyed through the mediums of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Through Bob Harris and Charlotte. ill Murray you are great. Scarlett, not only for this but also for Pearl Earring and Horse Whisperer, I want to have your baby.<br />I think Sophia Copolla's taken a lot of garbage from morons for making a film that asks for a little effort. Forget it Sophia. Enough of us love this movie just as it is, and thank you for it over and over again. <br />On a bad note, having watched it five times on DVD, I can appreciate the previews but would rather not be forced to watch them. That really sucks. I burn DVDs so I know how easy it would have been to give people a choice here. A black mark for the moron in marketing who decided this.

0345413377|5.0|The point of departure for this truly creative fantasy/parallel worlds trilogy is an inversion of Milton's Paradise Lost.  In the latter, Milton presented a poetic account and justification of the divine plan for the Universe.  In Pullman's books, the Miltonic version is a distorted view of real events.  In the Universe created by Pullman, a powerful angelic force, the Authority, claimed power over the previously created Universe and has been abusing this power for millennia to keep humanity (and other sentient species) in a form of bondage.  This bondage ramifies throughout an virtually infinite number of parallel worlds.  This trilogy describes a revolt against the Authority and its overthrow.  The principle characters are 2 children, one from our world and one from a closely related parallel world with mixed features of the 20th century and Victorian Europe.  The initial plot strand concerns efforts to understand a mysterious component of the Universe called Dust or Dark Energy.  The following complicated plot is essentially a coming of age story as the two children encounter many exotic features of their and related worlds.  The plot incorporates elements of Paradise Lost and the Garden of Eden myth.<br />The quality of writing in these books is superb.  A host of interesting characters and high quality prose.  Pullman's imagination is remarkable.  He has essentially developed a whole new mythology incorporating elements of modern science, religious allegory, and modern history.  Perhaps the only flaw is that he may have packed too much into the final and concluding book of the trilogy, which is an interesting compound of Armageddon, Ragnorak, and the Garden of Eden story.<br />These books have produced some controversy as some feel that they are anti-religious, even specifically anti-Christian.  Pullman has denied this interpretation and suggested that the books are an allegorical attack on all forms of dogmatism and authoritarianism.  This disclaimer seems disingenuous.  One thing that Pullman very clearly attacks is the idea that there is a separate soul distinct from the body.  An important and at times poetically presented component of these books is the idea that humans are an intrinsic, not separate component, of the natural world.  Pullman actually presents a pantheistic view of the world with consciousness an immanent and emergent part of the natural world and humans (and other sentients) as particular extensions of this aspect of the natural world.  He also allegorically criticizes human attempts to overwhelmingly control the natural world.  Whatever he states, these views are a trenchant criticism of any world view resting on the idea of separate and eternal souls.ingenuous.

This is a movie for people that will think the second best solution to a problem first..What if you knew when your time was up..What if you knew who you really loved.How would a person react if he was offered the truth of his existense and how easy it is for a person to sacrifice his life for the good of his beloved ones.Utterly poetic,this movie demands thought and critique from its viewers.Not an easy film to watch, good perfomances, a storyline that deals with westerners fear  of the inevitable, the unknown and the obscure.Dont watch this movie if you have never questioned your existence.

B00012QM8G|1.0|This movie is in black and white.<BR> Do you know what this means?<BR> There is less data to digitize for compression when mastering a DVD. So the whole movie would have easily fit on one side of a two layered disc, otherwise known as DVD-9. There is just no excuse. This kind of decision was deliberatly made since you just do not see this kind of mastering anymore. Every major DVD since 2000 has been Dual-layer. This is bad, but don't blame Universal. Look what they did for Rob Cohens' Daylight, Dragonheart and Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story. Top drawer DVD's. Not only should this have been a two disc set, with commentary, trailers, photo gallery, featurettes, and dynamic menus, it should have been $3 less that what I paid for it. Splitting a movie across two discs, whether separate or in a flipping arrangment, is just insipid. This is an issue that even non-cinephiles appreciate, because it means revisiting the days of getting up to hit eject. Try again Steve...

0553284347|2.0|I picked this book up from a used book store mostly because, as as someone who does family support work and has worked with abused children, I felt compelled to read it - the book is considered a classic. It hasn't, at least to me, stood the test of time. It may still be worth reading for professionals just on the grounds I stated - because of the book's status as a classic, but I wouldn't reccommend it for people who are still working through abuse issues.<br />First, the strengths of the book. Forward uses alot of vignettes to illustrate her points. This technique is helpful for readers because it demonstrates that, despite what some of her critics have suggested, she doesn't consider every parent who has ever raised his/her voice to a child to be a toxic parent. She does know what real abuse is, and she provides good definitions, including some good checklists, to help determine it. Some of her advice is very practical, such as the need for counselling, and the use of techniques such as role play and letter writing. The book is fast paced and easy to  understand.<br />So why such a low grade? Forward is stuck on blaming parents for their mistakes. She wants to label all abusive parents as monsters, and many aren't. At times, Forward seems to have an understanding of family systems theory, but she then fails to utilize it to have some empathy for the conditions that created the abusive parents in the first place. I don't think her level of anger is particularly useful to victims. Anger can only get a person so far; eventually there must be healing. I also disagree, based on solid research, with her stance against forgiveness. Eventually, if victims don't forgive, they will remain under the control of the abuse/abuser. I don't think Forward really understands what forgiveness is - it has nothing to do with letting the abuser off the hook, or saying what they did was ok. To a lesser extent, I also disagree with Forward's assertion that confrontation is necessary in all cases. I think in some cases, just admitting to oneself what happened and acknowledging that you are not to blame is not only enough, it is the smartest, most productive course of action.<br />I realize that the majority of my criticisms of the book are based on my particular theoretical orientation as someone who works with children/families. Normally, I wouldn't necessarily take marks off in a rating based on that. The reason I've done so is because I think this book is marked toward people who are coming to grips with childhood abuse, and, depending upon where a person is in their process, I believe that Forward's approach could actually do damage. This is a book that, if it is to be read at all, should be read by therapists, counsellors, family support workers, child and youth care workers, and social workers should read, take what they consider to be of value, and use that information to help adults.all cases.

B00006RCPM|5.0|I'll skip summarizing the story of this film, as other Amazon reviewers have done that quite well.  I'll just state that I only give 5 stars to a film that I'd want to watch again, that surprised and entertained me, and that held my attention and sucked me into its world.  These are things Spielberg usually does quite well, but in this case &quot;Minority Report&quot; does not look or feel anything at all like a Spielberg film until the very final wrapup scenes post action.<br />First, the whole 2-1/2 hours is loaded with futuristic glimpses of a society whose technological fast forward has gone into hyperdrive.  There are so many of these ideas put forth that if you'll blink you'll miss one or two---even if you're using your own eyes and not someone else's that you bought on the black market.  Where many SF films insert two or three such ideas, and usually milk them for all they're worth, Spielberg's writers have so many that some just blink by the corner of your eye (again, whosever are in use).<br />The story is compelling, and so fast-paced you have to really pay close attention in several places or you'll lose track.  For some viewers that may be a drawback, but I like a challenge.  That pace does cover two or three plot holes, but it plays fair by also letting a couple of red herrings zoom by you too. <br />All in all the script is plausible and intelligent, a warning against surrendering one's civil rights.  In fact, it does this so well that at film's end I found myself seriously questioning the fate of the Precrime Division in spite of its shortcomings.  Spielberg is being subversive in this, and although his preaching is a bit heavy-handed as always, and even though the multiple endings of the various plot lines feel contrived and tacked on, the first 2 hrs 20 mins of the film are so incredibly compelling that I'll certainly be watching again to see how much I missed the first time through.
1577311523|3.0|Glancing over some previous reviews, I am truly happy to hear there were some people who experienced some kind of relief from the book; I cannot say the same for myself. To be frank, Tolle's so called \\"enlightenment\\" experience is where my I first grew skeptical of his work. I simply was not buying it, which for me drew into question the entire book's authenticity. Tolle needed a better editor, for I would have placed his \\"enlightenment story\\" at the end; I mean no spiritual writer needs to prove they \\"got it\\" with a literal account! Their words should do all the explaining and proving. I don't even know what Eckhart meant when he said he experienced enlightenment. Was it this affirmation of the \\"now?\\" Now is not special, nothing is special. Don't make special, then you already have enlightenment.<br />High and low, enlightened and not enlightened. All hot air. If you really want to get to the matter of things, PUT IT ALL DOWN and ONLY GO STRAIGHT. Those are the words of the 78th Zen Patriarch Seung Sahn, who's book \\"The Compass of Zen\\" you can find here on Amazon. If you are experiencing a kind of crisis in your life, or \\"looking and searching\\" for some sort of answer, his book will point you on your way. The Power of Now only touches the surface of things, while Seung Sahn will cut to the straight to the bone. Don't believe me? Then don't believe me, order this book instead. Who knows?-you may end up benefiting from it. But at the very least pick up The Compass while your at it, and you tell me who understands. You tell me who can cut to the heart of a matter. In short, who's the Zen master? Take care my friends.
B00015HVI8|1.0|There were some good episodes in the 6th season - Abyss, Paradise Lost, Unnatural Selection, The Changeling and Full Circle.  But I was very disappointed with the season as a whole.  Poor writing, boring cliched plots, the absence of Daniel Jackson and the presence of bland Jonas Quinn makes season 6 my least favorite Stargate season so far.
0780021150|2.0|Maybe this shocked in its day, but it's terribly dated, with long dialogue scenes that could have been condensed way down. Interesting to see Peter Lorre so young and speaking German. But I thought I'd be caught up in the actual movie, but was forced to watch it as a piece of film history, like a college film class. The one thing that prevents film from being the greatest art form is movies date so quickly. This is a perfect example.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Starship Troopers is, plain and simple, a terrible movie.  It embodies everything that makes for bad science fiction: terrible acting, a brain-dead plot, lots of weak effects shots, and a total absence of emotional impact.  The supposed complexity of the Nazi themes that Verhoeven tacked on to the story is a joke; this movie has all the depth of a mud puddle in Death Valley.  It is clear that Heinleins engaging story about military service and the meaning of citizenship (and yes, blowing up bugs) was either laughably mis-interpreted by Verhoeven, or so far beyond his level of reading comprehension that he just threw it away so he could make a movie about space Nazis that would showcase the D-minus grades he must have gotten in science class.<br />Furthermore, this movie isnt even any good as a brain-dead action flick.  I can appreciate movies that blow stuff up real good.  But the effects here are pretty weak, the action scenes are mostly boring, and the military operations are so stupid that you will want to strangle yourself with a licorice.  Apparently, in a couple hundred years land battles will consist of disorganized crowds of idiots running around aimlessly, shooting weaker weapons than we had in the 1970s.  The action scenes with the bugs are pretty much a really bad ripoff of Aliens, only without the cool weapons, well-staged action, snappy one-liners, claustrophobia or genuine suspense.  And the spaceships look worse than the models used in Star Trek: The Motion Picture back in 1979.  I kid you not, there are probably cooler space ships made out of Leggos.<br />The movie has no intellectual content, and in fact outright insults your intelligence.  It looks less cool than sci-fi movies that are 20+ years older.  The action is lame, with the only upside that you get to see lame characters you hate have their brains eaten.  There is some gratuitous nudity, but Denise Richards doesnt put out in this movie, except maybe her eyebrows, so if you want smut you are better off renting Wild Things.  Nobody should watch this movie, except maybe to get drunk and make fun of it.  But there are even better movies to do THAT with, like Evil Dead 2.<br />-If you like smart science fiction, you will hate it because it is moronic.<BR>-If you like Heinlein, you will hate it because about 100 IQ points got lost somewhere between the book and the big screen.<BR>-If you like dumb science fiction, you will still hate it because the effects are lame and the action is stupid and poorly done.<BR>-If you like just about any movie genre, you will still hate it because the acting is terrible and the story is weak.
B000002WYT|5.0|Everyone always says that they are the biggest fan of their favorite band.  I can honestly say that I might be one of the biggest DMB fanatics ever.  This DMB album leaves no exceptions and, quite possibly, is my favorite.<br />I own every single DMB album - single, live, studio - in existence today, and I must say, none of them impacted me the way \\"Crash\\" did.  It may also be because several of the songs on this album are very sentimental to me.  The only DMB album that could be capable of even grazing Crash as the best would be Under the Table and Dreaming.  While most people enjoy Before These Crowded Streets more than any of them, I think UTTAD has a rawness to it - it showed more of Dave to us, the listener.<br />Out of all of DMB's albums, I believe that Crash is the largest crowd pleaser.  And that's not necessarily a bad thing.  While most of the time crowd pleasers are somewhat looked down upon - not hated - by true hardcore fanatics, this is a big exception.  Come to think of it, isn't EVERY DMB album?<br />All of the DMB haters out there call fans like me pseudo-intellectual, Starbucks drinking, college attending freaks.  One, I'm not in college yet.  And two, we just have different tastes, so get over it.  Dave's voice does not sound like a dying cat, either.  Atleast he's original and doesn't sound like everyone else.  That's like saying Bob Dylan is a wannabe.<br />All right, enough about my personal feelings of DMB.  Here's a list of the songs: <br />So Much to Say - A good song to laugh about.  But watch the music video to get the full impact of the lyrics.  It's a journey through Dave's mind.<br />Two Step - A good song to sit and listen to.  It's very complex in the way that the instruments fit together, and is a musical showcase for every member of the band.<br />Crash Into Me - A very special, personal song in my heart.  The song isn't exactly about love as most people think it is.  It's more about the erotic fantasies of a boy.. In this case, Dave.  It's still very beautiful and VERY sexy.  The best line would have to be either \\"Hike up your skirt a little more, and show the world to me\\", or \\"I'm the king of the castle, you're the dirty rascal.\\"  My favorite song of all time (besides Jimi Thing).<br />Too Much - Haha!  Very entertaining!  I love this song because of the video mainly.  I kind of interpretted it in the way I wished, so now I think it's very funny.<br />#41 - I can't really explain why, but this song made me cry the first time I heard it.  It's very impacting, and it sounds as though Dave is suffering in this song.  And I don't mean his voice - the music, his lyrics, everything.  Very emotional.  Just read the lyrics, you'll understand.  It's another song that stays dear to me for personal reasons.<br />Say Goodbye - It's another sexy song by Dave.  I know it sounds bad, especially me being female, but I think it's beautiful this kind of reality exists.  There's something beautiful in the scenario I guess, the fact that two friends can leave their true lives behind and spend one night of passion together.  It's a wonderful thing.<br />Drive In Drive Out - Great song.  Very fast, very pounding, very good.  I love this song when I'm driving.<br />Let You Down - A good, romantic song.  The best line is \\"Let me climb up you to the top so I can see the view, from up there ~ Tangled in your hair.\\"<br />Lie In Our Graves - A very, VERY good song!  I just wish they would've kept Leroi's solo in.  I play several instruments, but saxaphone was my first, so I'm partial to Leroi's playing.  This song is special to me, and I hope other people will realize the depth to this song.  Not just the lyrics, but the music too.<br />Cry Freedom - This is a very sad song.  I think this is a song many people can interpret as their own because of the emotion it evokes.  This is another song that I hope people can realize the depth and meaning to.<br />Tripping Billies - Great song.  It's very emotional, especially ifyou know the meaning of the song.  Boyd's mini-solo has to be one of the most awesome musical displays I've ever heard.  I feel so much happier and fufilled when I hear this song.<br />Proudest Monkey - Good song.  Enough said.  (Hahaha!)<br />Well, that's it.  That's my long, boring review.  Thanks for reading, and I hope I was helpful.  Live on forever, DMB!

B00005OAIE|1.0|At first, I might have enjoyed John Mayer.  I heard a couple of songs and I wasn't completely disgusted... until I heard most of his OTHER songs that weren't famous and when I saw him on Austin City Limits with Buddy Guy late one night.<BR>     This guy, is HORRIBLE.  Talk about someone who needs to get his own gig!  I am probably one of the most devoted Dave Matthews/ Band fans in the world, so of course I hate John Mayer.  I see nothing wrong with him looking up to Dave, but he tries to dance and perform like him - which, I must say, is a nasty-looking failed attempt.<BR>     Now as for his music, I think John Mayer is probably semi-talented.  Of course, he's probably one of the guys you'd see in college on the steps of his dormitory, playing acoustic guitar with girls falling all over him, which I don't get.  Yeah I know, don't give me the &quot;Chicks Dig Dave&quot; thing.  I know they do!  I am a girl and I am completely overwhelmed by Dave and his playing because he's actually talented, unlike Mr.Mayer.<BR>But I'm also obsessed with the rest of DMB, not just Dave.  <BR>     Whatever you do, don't buy this CD!  Buy something with lyrical depth, like some CDs by Dave Matthews Band, Jude, Bob Dylan, Jeff Buckley, or the Red House Painters.  Then, buy something with more musicality than lyrical depth - Phish and DMB are good examples for this.  I know most of these people hold NO resemblence to John Mayer, especially Jeff Buckley, but that is exactly why I put them as recommendations.  Never buy anything by John Mayer!  Never ever EVER!

B00005QZWI|5.0|A quaint Hobbit hole in the Shire; A dark hall of Moria and its deteriorated grandeur; A mysterious Elven haven high atop the trees. As you listen to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack, you are transported to these places and countless other destinations within Middle-Earth. Howard Shore manages to give each realm and each race an individual theme that he weaves throughout the entire trilogy's score. Each theme is perfectly akin to that realm or race and it highlights the attributes of the particular area or creature. For example, \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" - Track # 2, has a sweet and humble sound, much like that of a hobbit's personality. It is not dark and overwhelming nor sad or dreary. \\"Concerning Hobbits\\" lets you know, for instance that you are observing a hobbit busily working in a field on a bright clear day. This piece is cheerful and always makes the listener feel happy. \\"The Ring Goes South\\" - Track # 11 features the beloved 'Fellowship Theme' and accompanies the scene in the film where each member of the Fellowship passes over the top of a mountain. The Fellowship theme is prominent and gives the listener the notion that now, these people/creatures have come together as one united group and there is no turning back. Another notable mention is Enya's work on the score in both \\"The Council of Elrond\\" [featuring the song \\"Aniron (Theme for Aragorn and Arwen)\\" composed & performed by Enya] and \\"May it Be\\" composed & performed by Enya] In \\"Aniron,\\" Enya's sound adds the ethereal quality that is so characteristic of the Elves and in \\"May it Be\\" she conveys the qualities of the hero, Frodo Baggins with the melodic words about honesty, innocence, faithfulness, and giving your all to reach a goal. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack is magnificent in its sound and dedication to the story being told through the film. A must have for any Lord of the Rings or film score fans.

0385336942|5.0|Picked this up just because its subjects were both of interest -- WWII and Alaska.  Thought I knew everything about the former and always wanted to visit the latter. Turns out this is an intriguing and thoroughly researched novel about a little known but shockingly successful Japanese effort to terrorize the US in late WWII with paper &quot;balloon bombs&quot; -- set in Alaska -- a genuine American frontier. Its got history, mysticism, adventure, interesting characters and Alaska - a hard to beat combination. Highly recommend it!
6304698623|1.0|While this version of A Little Princess is not necessarily bad, the producers took so many liberties with Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel that people who've read the book may be unable to watch it. The boarding school is in London, not New York, for example, and the addition of songs and fuzzily filmed dancing detracts. If you want the accurate and entertaining version, go for the WonderWorks A Little Princess with Amelia Shankley, Maureen Lipman, Miriam Margolys, and Nigel Havers. I hope you need not be warned away from the Shirley Temple version.

B00004YZFR|5.0|As a testimony to the events at Altamont in the waning months of 1969, this film is first rate.  However, if one is looking for a &quot;concert film&quot; of the Stones then one will be sorely disappointed, as this was undeniably their worst performance.<br />The concert was doomed from the start, as San Francisco seemed reluctant to provide the Stones with a venue for their free concert.  I think many people thought this was little more than an attempt to upstage Woodstock, a cheap form of self-promotion.  It came at the end of their American tour, and for me seemed to be a fitting farewell.  The film does a remarkable job of following the Stones on their date with tragedy.<br />Of course the single most stupid move was having the Hell's Angels act as security for the concert.  Knowing their reputation, I would think this would have served as ample warning but it seems the Stones, like others, thought the idea of involving the Angels would add to the psychedelic experience. &quot;Big mistake,&quot; Sonny Barger said afterward as some unruly kids messed with their bikes.<br />The film focuses on the chaos that ensued.  One gets little feeling of the size of the crowd except for a few aerial views of the estimated 300,000 people.  The action occurred around the stage, which was too low and constantly had to be cleared.  The Angels dominated the stage, surrounding the performers which ranged from The Flying Burrito Brothers to Jefferson Airplane, like a phalanx.  The concert had to be stopped many times as the Angels beat back the crowd, fueling the disgust and anger that developed, reaching crisis point when the Stones finally took stage in the early evening hours.  Mick seemed honestly confused by what was going on.  It was completely out of his control as his feeble efforts at crowd control fell on deaf ears.  It was during &quot;Under My Thumb&quot; that the fatal stabbing took place, and the film captures that chilling moment, leaving one to doubt that the black man in the green suit had a gun, which the Angels claim he did.<br />The Stones look back over the concert tour in the editing room, offering a few candid comments on what took place.  The concert earned them their infamous place in rock and roll history.  The film offers only fleeting glimpses of the other performers that shared the stage with the Stones.  The Dead was on hand as well, but all one sees of them is a short take of Garcia and Weir and Kreutzmann (I believe) back stage commenting on the violence taking place. This was a bad trip.k man in the green suit had a gun, which the Angels claim he did.<br />The Stones look back over the concert tour in the editing room, offering a few candid comments on what took place.

0783225792|4.0|I was born in Chicago, and my father went to Stienmetz high school with Tony Spilotro, the mobster portrayed in this film by Joe Pesci. I grew up listening to stories about \\"the Ant\\" (not flattering), and when he was finally whacked, my old man (a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times) wrote what amounted to his obitiuary. In it he recalled such charming Spilotro antics as the time he threw acid at a girl who had rebuffed his advances and the time he tried to split open my dad's head, and thus prevent my birth, with a T-square during shop class. To top it off, I recently discovered my Dad's old yearbook (1955 or so), in which he and the future boss of Las Vegas are standing in true 1950s glory (slicked hair, plaid shirts, everybody wearing horn-rimmed glasses) next to each other on picture day.<br />So I guess you could say I had a personal interest in seeing how Marty Scorcese and his \\"Goodfellas\\" crew would tackle the subject of transplanted Chicago mobsters in the neon desert. My final verdict: they all did a hell of a job.<br />Pesci, as \\"Nicky Salerno\\" (all the names have been changed to protect the guilty) is just as horrifying and vicious here as he was as \\"Tommy DiVito\\" in \\"Goodfellas\\"; Pugnacious, bloodthirsty, bad-tempered, arrogant, and paranoid, but also capable of humor, loyalty and a certain weird charm. Some would say he was just playing the same character again, and yeah, he is, but he's so damn good at it, who cares?<br />Bobby D is superb (what else?) as \\"Ace Rothstien\\" -- the micro-managing, ego-maniacial Chicago handicapper and casino boss who trades in on his friendship with mobsters to become a big time player in Vegas, and promptly realizes he's let the snake in the manger. Nicky is what mobsters call a \\"Cowboy\\" -- a crazy, reckless hoodlum who thinks with his fists (or his gun, or the sharp end of a pen, or a telephone, or whatever's handy) and creates more wreckage than profit. He also attracts the attention of the Feds and the Nevada Gaming Commission, who soon make Ace's life miserable, and more importantly, begin to interfere with the Mob's ability to \\"skim\\" Casino profits back to Chicago. And if you know anything about the Outfit (as it is called there), you know N - O - B - O - D - Y is going to interfere with their profits and get away unscathed.<br />\\"Casino\\" is one of those movies where you watch bad guys get their hands on something really big, and drive it straight into the ground. Things blow up, people get beaten and whacked, fortunes are made and squandered, and monster egos crash against each other like bumper cars. There are many similiarities to \\"Goodfellas\\" except the stakes are much higher, and like \\"Goodfellas\\" there is not a character you really can root for -- Ace is miserly, controlling, egocentric and arrogant, Nicky is a straight up homicidal maniac, and Stone's character is your typical scheming, treacherous hooker-hustler. A lot of people felt this movie was the same thing, with the same cast, done not quite as well, and indeed, \\"Casino\\" is not as good as \\"Fellas\\" but it is a very good movie all the same. If \\"Fellas\\" had never been made, this might be a top-5 Mob movie of all time. I recommend it to anyone with a gangland fetish, 80's nostalgia and strong stomach.<br />And by the way, the actor Frank Vincent, who gets revenge on Pesci in this film (with a baseball bat) for twice getting the best of him in previous Scorsese movies (\\"Raging Bull\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\"), actually bears a stronger resemblance to the real Tony Spilotro than Joe Pesci does....wierd.ommission, who soon make Ace's life miserable, and more importantly, begin to interfere with the Mob's ability to \\"skim\\" Casino profits back to Chicago.

B000001ESF|5.0|Geddy Lee in his post Album, Fly By Night, was a bit vocally shaky. But on 2112 he found the sound that everyone would like. But the reason why I buy Rush albums is because with a funky groove that Lee/Lifeson pump out, Neil Peart has his thundering Drum ability to do 16th notes on one beat at 144 beats per minute. That would be 2304 beats on the drum per minute, which makes Neil Peart the Greatest Drummer to ever walk on the face of the earth. Buy this CD, it is a rock and roll masterpiece.
B000003TBP|1.0|I waited a long to buy this (I always loved &quot;...and a microphone&quot;), but what a HUGE disappointment. If you are over forty-four years old and were aware of music since you were ten, don't waste your time on this. This album is the DEFINTION of derivative. I will only listen to it once, because I got tired of writing down each song's obvious original infuence: Strawberry Alarm Clock, Zappa, Country Joe and the Fish, oh my goodness, this guy should be paying these groups royalties for this rip off! What a joke. Album of the year? Puhlease. The original stuff was good... thirty years ago. Why can't we all just move on?
B00007G1ZC|3.0|Kurosawa's Dreams is a collection of short films that work as part of a whole, but like all collections some films are far inferior then others. The film is Kurosawa's most personal and several segments are a bit heavy handed and indulgant. The segments that worked for me were among the best of Kurosawa. The Peach Orchard with its mysterious mood and breathtaking color is a highlight. The Tunnel with a powerful performance by the actor playing the officer is a strong and simple reflection on war. Crows is a stunning segment that recreates and uses effects to lead its character through the paintings of Van Gogh. The weakest segment is Mount Fuji in Red which uses poor special effects to tell an awkward cautionary tale. The other segments are intermitantly interesting, but really aren't that striking. If it was anyone else the film would be a masterpiece, but for someone of the caliber of Kurosawa it is simply good.<br />Video: If you enjoy the film or are a Kurosawa collector you are in for a treat with this stunning transfer of the film. It is very sharp and clean with good detail in the shadows. What knocked my socks off was the color which is rendered beautifully. It is absolutely gorgeous. A great transfer.<br />Sound: Very good with nice separation and kick on the music and sound effects.<br />Extras: Nothing not even a trailer, although there is a nice Kurosawa filmography with a cool menu. I would have liked to see a documentary on the making of the Crows segment. The package is poor, only a half plastic case with cardboard cover. The side clip leaves an idention and mark on the cover picture. This didn't get the Warner two disc packaging with slip case. The two disc Warner packages don't have a clip so the cover isn't damaged, too bad they don't package single discs like this.
0425098478|4.0|The One Minute Manager by Drs. Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson was a breviloquent, easy to read manual on efficient yet effective management.  The text focuses on goal setting, one minute praising, and constructive reprimands; the principles are clearly stated and widely applicable to a range of personal and professional circumstances.<br />The authors underscore the importance of clearly visualizing, verbalizing, and working toward the actualization of short-term and long-term goals.  Goals are written down in 250 words or less then used to guide and gauge daily progress toward the declared objectives.  Goal-setting can be applied in one's personal life or professional life providing they are in harmony with the goals of the organization.<br />The \\"second secret\\" to effective management is the \\"one-minute praising\\".  The authors stress the importance of catching subordinates in the act of \\"doing something good\\" and recognizing their good work.  Correspondingly, constructive criticism is necessary at times.  The authors stress the \\"one-minute reprimand\\" - good managers let subordinates know what they did wrong, that they are capable of doing better, and facilitate the identification and implementation of corrective action.<br />The principles discussed in One Minute Manager are extremely valuable in a professional medical workplace.  Employees should be focused on their own goals as well as those of the office as a whole.  In such a high-stress environment, recognition of even the smallest employee successes will lead to a more productive workplace.
0446608955|5.0|Sparks somehow manages to pull off what most authours could probably never even contemplate: he fufils his promise. First I laughed, then I cried. The story at first seems incredibly clich, yet another book about true love between two completely opposite high school students. Yet somehow this book manages not to fall into the well worn rut that most of these have created with their passage. The story remains fresh and new, with a heart-breaking twist just as you near the end, and hope for the standard happy ending we have become so accustomed to. It's not a difficult read, nothing taxing enough to take more an a few hours, yet it carries itself beautifully and is well worth the minimal amount of time it requires.
B00000JLWW|3.0|This is one of those movies where the first time you see it you fall in love and you think it's great, but the second time you think, &quot;It's not really that great.&quot; The special effects and camera angles and everything was great in making it look real.  But the Jack and Rose thing had some silly points.  For one thing, at the end, why couldn't she move over and let him on.  She had to know he would die.  And when Rose jumped out of the lifeboat because she couldn't go without Jack, I really don't think they would've spent that much time making out, and more time thinking of what to do.  Awards for special effects and directing, it definently deserved that, but best picture, not so sure.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|This has got to be one of the most overrated and boring films of all time. I went in expecting a movie that would deliver a good story about a naval battle and the such.  I left the theater feeling ripped off.  The movie spends a painfully long amount of time on useless and irrelevant little stories about so called \\"Life on the sea\\".  This film shouldn't even be described as a Full length movie.  It should be described as a very long documentary (read dull and slow) about naval life paired with a mini action short.  The only thing that kept us from falling asleep during the film was the nicely done cinematography.  <br />IMO, don't waste your time and money.

0804106304|5.0|This is an excellent book. It's been over a month since I finished it, but it still exists in my mind as a very good story told through very good writing. Amy Tan does a wonderful job spinning a tale, several of them actually, in this work of art that is widely considered (with good reason) to be a modern classic.<br />For someone like myself, married to a Taiwanese woman, this book lends insight into a world I am familiar with, yet remain a good distance from truly understanding. I find it a fascinating topic of discussion for my perspective as it pertains to my wife, her family, and my Chinese friends. This book, as simple and short as it is, packs a significant cultural punch through the nuances of the words it is written in.<br />Yet you hardly need to be in my position to read this book. It stands on its own as a great piece of work. You won't like it if you have an inclination against things Asian, such as those enamored with emotions as seen in The Rising Sun. I won't try to convince those readers. Otherwise, this book offers something for any reader.<br />This is a touching narrative about 4 American women of Chinese descent and their mothers who were born in China. The story is actually 8 stories, very loosely brought together by a centerpiece that allows you to slide from one narrative to the next, never having to draw much of a connection between them. The book sheds light on the separation between each mother and her daughter, while showing how all 4 mothers and all 4 daughters live similar lives.<br />Tan does a splendid job writing a splendid book. Anyone interested in modern literature would do themselves justice to read this. I readily admit I have more riding on this book than many who might read it. Yet I believe the book stands on its own as worth the read, no matter what your background.<br />Very highly recommended.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The only good thing about this film was that the title is very fitting, I was definitely lost. I have nothing against artistic films, but they need to have some kind of point. Before you waste your money buying/renting this movie go to your local bar and people watch for a couple of hours. If you find this enjoyable this movie is for you.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Given how musical tastes change over the years, it's not uncommon for people to find that the music of their youth isn't quite so appealing anymore. Yet for me, even as I become absorbed by avant-garde, Rock-in-Opposition, 20th/21st century classical, modern jazz, and other wild n' crazy stuff, Iron Maiden remains very endearing. And it's not just nostalgia (distorting the past to fit the sensibilities of the present). Iron Maiden is just a great, great band, and _Piece of Mind_ remains my favorite album in their considerable catalogue (followed by _Seventh Son..._).<br />Although it will probably pain a lot of hardcore Maiden lovers to hear me say it, but I think Iron Maiden's music has always had a certain metal-pop quality to it. I do NOT mean that Iron Maiden should in any way be associated with pathetic pantywaists like Poison or Warrant (such bands justify the repeal of the First Amendment). But in addition to insatiable metal energy and carnivorous, immortal metal riffs &amp; solos, Maiden has always placed an immense emphasis on vocals, hooks, melodies, and tight songs. Yeah, they're cheesy, but Maiden is comfortable with their intrinsic metal cheesiness, so it works for them rather than against them. (A worse crime than cheesiness is to be completely oblivious to your cheesiness -- for an empirical illustration of this theory, I refer you to the legions of horrible European power metal bands like Stratovarius and Helloween.)<br />_Piece of Mind_ is an amazing album with not a single weak track. Of course, some songs are still better than others, and those are veritably deserving metal classics. There's \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", with its choppy, spitfire riffing; \\"The Trooper\\" with its unforgettable, evocative metal gallop and lyrics; and \\"Flight of Icarus\\", with its classic chorus and anthemic reach. \\"Revelations\\" is an epic that surrounds lyrical moments of beautiful imagery with memorable metal riffing. There is also \\"Still Life\\", one of the most tragically underrated Iron Maiden songs, with a mysterious opening that kicks into one of the most infectious and catchy songs in their catalogue. Apparently a lot of people think \\"Sun and Steel\\" and \\"Quest for Fire\\" are crap or at best inconvenient filler, I really like those songs (\\"Sun and Steel\\" especially!). The final epic, \\"To Tame a Land\\", suggests the direction the band would take with _Seventh Son_, carefully building until its monumental, epic guitar harmony at the end -- it remains one of the highpoints of their formidable songwriting genius.<br />It's a classic, and it doesn't really need me saying so. But another positive review never hurt anyone.derrated Iron Maiden songs, with a mysterious opening that kicks into one of the most infectious and catchy songs in their catalogue.

B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is simply stunning in terms of the depth of its sounds.    Perhaps the peak occurs in the fifth track, Let Down, where Thom Yorke shows the extent of his vocal range.  This album has been characterized as &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;boring&quot; but it is really an amazing work with amazing complexity in arrangements and very nice lyrics.  It is not for the majority of the population, but for those who are looking for something meaningful in music, this is your bag. Happy listening.
B000002L9Y|4.0|This is a wonderful album with some classic songs by LB and CV, however what's missing is Stevie Nicks who was going through major drug issues at the time.  She only contributes 3 songs and they are very mediocre, her voice sounds awful.  Go buy Say You Will if you want to hear her sound the way she's supposed to sound!  Lindsey's songs like Big Love, Caroline and Family Man are all excellent and Christine McVie's Everywhere is a classic.

B000005JA8|1.0|The perfect soundtrack for a sub-normal life.
B00012QM8G|1.0|Universal should be ashamed of themselves. To package one of the greatest and most important films of all time in a cheap, non-sealing cardboard folder that provides totally inadaquate protection from dust and damage to one side of the two sided disk is simply disgraceful. Like others who have expressed themselves in this forum, I feel as though I've been ripped off.<br />There, I feel better, but I'd feel even better if Universal were offer a free replacement package that provided adequate protection for the disk.<br />One the subject of the disk, the transfer is first rate. I don't mind that the film is split (presumably so that they could provide the image quality they did), but I would have very much preferred that it be on two separate disk. It seems to me that two-sided disks are more subject to handling damage than are one-sided ones.
630463949X|3.0|The performers were outstanding but let me be the first to tell you that the audio quality from this concert DVD was mediocre at best.  If your home theater system has the ability to resolve the finer detail and fidelity of a well recorded concert, The Dance will disappoint you.  My biggest complaint is that this DVD lacks dynamic range.  Yes, it plays loud but on complex tracks (like Tusk) the audio is compressed and everything is at the same volume level.  Everything LOUD does not equal better.<br />Before you suspect my home theater system I should mention a number of concert DVD's with outstanding audio quality far superior to The Dance:  <br />Peter Gabriel - Secret World Live<BR>Peter Gabriel - Growing Up Live<BR>Eric Clapton - One More Car, One More Rider<BR>Eric Clapton - Unplugged<BR>The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over<BR>Norah Jones - Live in New Orleans<BR>Alison Krauss + Union Station Live<BR>Santana - Supernatural Live<BR>Joe Satriani - Live in San Francisco<BR>Concert for George (Harrison) - at the Royal Albert Hall<br />This is just a handful of other concert DVD titles that I own and they all sound much better than Fleetwood Mac The Dance.  For this reason I give The Dance just 3 stars.
B00009Z574|5.0|If you play electric, bass, keyboards, or drums in rock, or compose songs, then you MUST hear this album!!!!  It has some of the most innovative musicianship ever heard on a rock album.  Steve Howe on electric guitar, Chris Squire on bass, Rick Wakeman on keyboards, and Alan White on drums.  The bass has a remarkable \\"phat\\", fat sound throughout.  The various guitars (electric and acoustic) do many remarkable and amazing things in counterpoint to the other band members.  The keyboards (electric, harpsichord, etc.) also show excellent interplay with the overall sound.  The drumming is innovative and extremely impressive at times.  Singing and harmonics are fine but I warn you that this is echt-Jon Anderson and thus is very high pitched, sometimes almost shrill.  I think this album has been overlooked and underrated for several reasons:  1. The band turned away from the \\"bigger is better\\" style of composition.  Longest track here is 7:45.  This shouldn't be held against them.  The compositions are tight and loaded with ideas.  2. This is definitely the upbeat and comical side of the band.  Most people are looking for something to shut themselves away with for 2 hours.  Instead, this is progressive rock with a sense of humor.  Prog rock people are often too serious to acknowledge humor and fun in their bands' music.  3.  The singing turns some people off.  I can also imagine the embarrassment felt by many at hearing a voice even higher than Jon's in track 6 - it's his young son!  4. Normal lay listeners will be mystified by the enormous complexities of a good deal of the music. (Stick with it, you'll figure it out and it'll grow on you.  You'll wonder why you'd ever settled for less.)<br />This is a brilliant album!  Great innovation.  Only track 7 is in straightforward song format, but it is very nicely done.  \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\" is a rock masterpiece.  New listeners may just want to scrutinize that track alone for a while.  \\"Circus of Heaven\\", \\"ArrivingUFO\\", \\"Release Release\\" show a witty, playful yet artsy approach to the music that I just don't hear on any other album from the genre.  \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" was almost ordinary, but is then elevated in the last section by the grooviest combination of bass, electric guitar, and chromatic synths!  \\"Future Times-Rejoice\\" is pure upbeat, positive music.  Sophisticated but not depressing.  And \\"Madrigal\\" shows the wonderful fusion of \\"rock\\" with classical as harpsichord, spanish guitar, voice produce truly marvelous textures.  Same with \\"Circus of Heaven\\": what begins as a cycle of clever embellishments then shifts into an evocative, free-form, key-bending closing section.  So many musical elements all played out with amazing lightness yet complexity in a little 4-minute work!  Everyone please check out the lighter side of progressive rock and give it a chance here!   Prog rock doesn't all have to be Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" you know...
B000021XS0|4.0|Personally, I was kind of disapointed with this album when I first bought it.  <br />You see, I come from listening to bands like Iron Maiden, Iced Earth and Blind Guardian; bands which produce an ENTIRELY different sound, Power Metal vs. Progressive Metal.<BR>  <BR>At first I thought the songs from Scenes from a Memory were pretty stale and void of emotion. I was used to hearing great singers like Bruce Dickenson whail amzing choruses every minute and a half, with crunching yet simple guitar riffs in the background. No such thing with Dream Theater. Even the mature theme of the album confused me. Not the same as an Iced Earth concept.  <BR>However, there was no denying the production vales or level of musicianship (especially the dazzling guitar solos), and I certainly did respect the album. But the emotion, the energy... just wasn't there that first time. <BR> <BR>Everyone has heard a progressive song. But hearing Dream Theater's 'Scenes from a Memory' may too great a shift in style for some Heavy Metal fans. <br />I am happy to note, however, that this album is growing on me. <BR>And while I personally prefer 'Opeth' in the progressive metal category, I have no reservations calling Scenes from a Memory an good album.
B000002BBY|1.0|It must be really easy to land a major label record deal if you have a British band.  The rock critics can never get enough of British Invasion pop rock.  The good reviews a British band gets is bound to boost record sales.  That seems to be the case with Oasis.<BR>Oasis is another band in a long line of Brit-pop corporate rock bands.  There is nothing special or original about their imitation of the Beatles and Rolling Stones.  <BR>\\"(What's the story) Morning Glory\\" sounds like a phrase that comes straight from the sixties.  It's also an incredibly cheesy sounding phrase.<BR>The album is filled with terrible ballads.  The singer's voice is easily the worst part of the music.  It's one of those annoying voices that you would be able to hear over a talking crowd in a restaurant.  When he whines it becomes unbearable.  The lyrics have been done a thousand times before.<BR>In some songs they copy riffs off other artist like T. Rex and Wham.  They mask it with a little alternative style distortion so it's not so obvious.<BR>Oasis was big on rock radio when alternative reached its peak in 1995.  Oasis was where alternative rock bottomed out.  It's really hard to believe this album was acceptable, even in the mainstream.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Shame, shame, shame. How can anyone say anything to putdown this excellent pop singer/guitarist. I would like to see and hear these pompous know it all nobodys put out there own albums and see if they can come up with fresh, and catchy tunes as good as John Mayers. This guy is simply awesome. He has a unique voice, writes great acoustic guitar riff layden tunes. Dave matthews could only wish he had as good pop sensibility. This is great beautiful melodic music which is a releif to see nowadays an actual musician who can play an instrument flawlessly and write good songs. Would you rather have the Britney Spears, N-sync, or backstreet boys bubblegum crap? I would hope not. Take it for what it is, excellently crafted and arranged melodic pop songs. Dave Matthews long drawn out jams are nothing but a combo of pop and jazz which to my ears is long winded and does not do justice to either genre. Although he is talented and can be appreciated. So get used to Mr. Mayer, I'm sure he will be around for a long time. WAKE UP!!! AND REALLY LISTEN!
0316666343|5.0|This book completey turned me into a blubbering fool.  It's so sad to witness the life of someone being taken away, but to have to see that person never grow and have to see her family from afar is painful.  I think Alice Sebold's writing was complete brilliance.  To make an audience feel pangs of pain is something most writers cannot do nowadays.  This story not only made me cry, but made me feel that life was more than just my routine schedule.  It made me understand that life was worth experiencing, especially since not all of us have a lot of time.

0618164413|5.0|When I was a child, curious George was one of my favorites, and now this fine book allows me to pass along George's adventures to my own children.  Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it contains so many curious George stories.  You could read a different story each night for several nights.  My children have quickly become as fond of George as I was when I was a child.  The accompanying illustrations are very colorful and they definitely grab a young child's attention.  I highly recommend this fine children's book.  It is a great book to share with your children and perhaps serve as a reminder to your own childhood.
B0000630BT|5.0|This is an album that will go down in metal history for two reasons:<br />1. It signals the birth of German Power Metal, which incorporates British and American metal stylings, with PM bands such as Primal Fear, Gamma Ray, and Helloween all drawing influence from this album.<br />2. Not long after it was finished, Rob Halford took an 11 year sabbatical from Priest. He must have really liked this style though, because he favored it on 2 solo albums.<br />But it's best to think of it in a third way: This is the album you want to play when you REALLY want to totally shred your stereo. At the time this album was being made, Priest knew that they were losing ground to Guns N Roses and Metallica, so they just decided to kick ass and take names. The first half is Priest at their fastest and furious, the second half is a little slower but still packs quite a punch (even the ballad). Rob shows some pretty impressive range too, going from his trademark banshee wail to a very dark, brooding tone for a spoken passage on Nightcrawler(Happy nightmares kids!) Scott Travis pounds on the drums as if he had Thor's hammer, inspiring Glenn Tipton and Ken Downing to come up with some of their most ferocious twin axe attacks since Hell Bent For Leather. If your fellow metalheads dismiss Judas Priest as &quot;more of an 80s rock band&quot; then show them this one and prove them wrong.<br />A final recommendation: playing this one back to back with Halford's Resurrection and Primal Fear's Black Sun is a good way to gear up for reunited Priest's next album.<br />Let the moshing begin!!
B00000G3I2|5.0|One of my all time favourites.  <BR>I'm assuming you know what the film is about.  The cast is first rate, Tom Berenger and William Hurt particular highlights and the throwback to 1960's nostalgia is irresistable.  <BR>One complaint on the DVD though!  Why not release those scenes depicting the characters way back when and finally getting to see Costner?  According to Kasdan himself, that would be damaging because his character, Alex, should remain faceless so the audience can imagine him anyway they want.  Guess what, we all know it's Costner who played him so we already are imagining him as Alex everytime he is mentioned.
0385504209|1.0|This book is awful. I mean, religious, crime, detective, suspense, thriller novels, those sort of books are the ones i like. But one's that are based of fallacies in history, plain lies, and even HERESIES, it really makes me wonder what sort of book this is supposed to be. Is it a serious book? Is it a joke on society? Is it just to provoke a reaction? I have a friend at school who makes a habit of insulting religions with false information, and he is a twit, and held in disgust by most of my peers, even the atheists and gnostics! This book is bound to confuse people, especially those who will take that &quot;facts&quot; as facts. It is a dangerous book! None-the-less, there shall probably be a great documentary made about the complete lunacy of this book, which i will watch with open eyes. I just pray for all those who take the word as fact. I am not a fanatic who wishes for &quot;all those who read this book to burn is hell&quot;, i do not practice that sort of vengeful hatred, i just pray that people who read this book, will not take the information on face-value. That they will take the information and find out the truth before spreading lies about Leonardo Da Vinci, or the Church, or English history!<br />Please, just read this book with suspicion, or at least, regard it as a book, NOT a historical document!
0375713751|4.0|Ok, I have to say that the reader that said this book stinks has a right to their opinion, but to be so harsh is ridiculous, especially when there are many of us that can relate to this book in a lot of respects. I find myself relating to scenarios in this book quite a bit, especially with the juggling of working full time and caring for a family at home. I find this book hilarious and so easy to read. In my opinion, \\"trashy\\" is pretty far from the truth. There are so many other books out there that can be defined as trashy, and this is not one of them. It's an enjoyable read!! A bit slow at the start, but picked up quickly.
0440237688|5.0|I am a middle school teacher, and my 8th graders read this book each winter.  I love the discussions that it produces!  We do a group community project after we finish the reading and the students create their own utopias.  There is so much here, and the ambiguous ending is a great discussion itself!  I will probably use this book in my classroom for a long time!
B0001IN0DA|4.0|Was it the greatest wrestlemania ever??? well. . . I would say YES! but just barely over WM17. Here is the line up, and the match description. I won't tell you who wins!!! (personally I hate that!)<br />U.S. TITLE Match:  John Cena vs. Big Show - it wasn't the best match, but the best opener I've seen in WWE for a long time. not a 50-50 offence match, but an awsome finish!!! 5.5/10<br />TAG TITLES Match:  RVD&BookerT vs. LaResistance vs. TheDudley's vs. MarkJindrak&GarrisonCade - sorry, I can't spell jindract??? Anyway, it was a cool match but the format of the match sucked, it wasn't even elimination! 5/10<br />RIVALRY Match: Y2J vs. Christian - an awsome match, probably the fourth best of the night! SHOCKING ending, even though I saw it coming, but I'm good at thet stuff. anyway, good match! (suprisingly) 6.5/10<br />HANDYCAP Match: Evolution vs. Rock n' Sock connection - great match, Most probably think it was better than Jericho and Chritian but if you look at the length and the ending, most are wrong. Just barely worst than Jericho vs. Christian.6/10<br />PLAYBOY EVENING GOWN Match: Tori&Sable vs. Jackie&Stacey - Let's face it, we are all winner's in this one, but if not, then it was a sucky wrestling match, good gimick fill thingy.3/10<br />CRUISERWIEGHT OPEN Match: Chavo vs. Tajiri vs. Akio vs. Funaki vs. Mysterio vs. Sphycosis vs. Noble vs. Nunzio vs. Kidman vs. I forgot - Awsome, I hate smackdown but this was cool, third best on the card, Just Awsome!!! 7/10<br />SHOW COMBO. Match: Goldberg vs. Lesner - Boring!!! Half the match is a stupid lock up to see who's stronger! 4/10<br />TAG TITLES Match: S2H&Rakishi vs. Bashams vs. APA vs. WGTT - It was better than the Raw one but almost the same, again, I hate the format of the match, Sudden Death is never as good! 5/10<br />WOMENS TITLE Match: Molly vs. Victoria - What can I say, great match for women, crap for an ending though!(I mean the pin) 5/10<br />WWE TITLE Match: Angle vs. Gerrero - I thought it would suck. It looked like these two had no chemestry together! But they pulled off the second best match of the night. GOOD MATCH!!! 7.5/10<br />BRO vs. BRO: Undertaker vs. Kane - I was watching the event for this match only, let me tell you it was . . . SUCKY!!! the absolute biggest disapointment I have ever seen at wrestlemania! I wait for this match and it is a three minut piece of CRAP!!! If you buy this tape, fast foreward through this match, because it isn't even worth you're time, It doesn't even compare to WM14!!! Worste match of the night!!!           1/10 (only for undertakers return!)<br />WORLD TITLE Match: HBK vs. HHH vs. Chris Benoit - NO DQ, I loved it, Best match of the night and probably the closest thing to a ten (besides 1 other match) that I will ever give. It was sweeeeeet! I( could put it in 3 words from good ol' J.R. , \\"A CAR WRECK\\"!!! Great!!! I needed this after Taker and Kane!(really, I almost shut off the TV after that match!!) Amazing out of all three men, you can watch it over and over again. 9/10!!!<br />Over all it was truly, THE SHOWCASE OF THE IMMORTALS!!! I hope you buy it because it will be a classic someday, buy it for the Triple threat, or don't for Taker Kane, it's you're choice, they should have cool extras like past WM's and stuff!!!<br />!This is Nick Y. signin' out!
044100590X|5.0|This is a GREAT book. It is probably the best book I have ever read. Lord of The Rings is the only other book that I have read that compares to it. It is a must read to any person who likes science fiction books.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown's suspenseful tale of the search for the Holy Grail is what good fiction should be: intriguing, entertaining, and most of all, thought-provoking.<br />Robert Langdon is a symbologist whose life's work is the study of feminine symbology.  When Jacques Sauniere, the head curator of the Louvre, is murdered and Langdon's name is left in his final words, Langdon is dragged into a web of mysterious secret societies and obscure religious orders, all while being chased by police and those who killed Sauniere.  His quest begins simply to prove his innocence, but rapidly evolves into the ultimate quest--the quest for the Holy Grail.  Along the way, Langdon reveals hidden meanings in paintings and art spanning two millenia, all while racing to save the secret of the Grail and his own life.<br />Taken at face value, this book is quite simply entertaining. Brown obviously did a lot of research, and presents some interesting ideas.  To his credit (or perhaps to his discredit), he sneaks a couple of disclaimers into the dialogue text in an effort to be pragmatic and to lessen the impact of the some of his assertions.  But the fact remains that the book is a work of fiction, and should be taken as such; looking for fact in a fictional work is an exercise in futility.  As an author, Brown has license to twist reality, and whether or how much he did so is irrelevant.  In my opinion, he did it well and in a very entertaining manner.  The fact that so many people are talking about it is proof enough of this.<br />The only problem that I have with this book is that the characters were all a little to clean; they were simple, with very little complexity.  Brown also falls into the typical mystery author trap, where characters are endowed with magical cognizant powers.<br />This book, as a work of fiction, is entertaining.  It never failed to keep my attention, and was fairly stimulating from the first page to the last.  Aside from the somewhat bland characters, I can't complain.  This is a good, solid, entertaining book.in.  This is a good, solid, entertaining book.
0486274268|5.0|This is one of the best books I have found on animal drawing. The caricature sections are one of the highlights of this book because the author is a former Walt Disney artist. Highly recommended!
0345363132|5.0|This is the absolute best book I've ever read about Richard III.  For once we are able to see him as human, not as the monster he's been so often portrayed as.  This book was spellbinding!  It is written so beautifully that as I came closer to the time of Richard's death, I found myself reading it slowly as I was dreading it.  I acutally felt an attachment to this Richard and felt remorse at losing him.  There are very few books that have moved me like this one did.

Long live the New King of Swing!<br />For weeks now the Michael Buble disc has been in constant rotation both at my home and in my office. My office now consists of Michael Buble's newest and best fans. We love him in Michigan!
B000008M8F|4.0|I'll never forget the first time I saw this album at a local record store and I saw the album cover, I was hooked on getting the album and I wish that this album wasn't so hard to find, the album opens with 'Long Way From Home' (not to be confused with Foreigner's version) and it's a good way to start the album, Walking Through the Shadow of the Blues is also a beautiful song with sensitive vocals and lyrics, Help Me Thro' the Day is one of the most beautiful ballad's that I've ever heard and it sure beats the heck out of Is This Love, Medicine Man is a good rocker with great lyrics, You and Me and Mean Business are what I consider it being the weakest songs but it's far from bad and I'll gladly take it over the best stuff of today's music, Love Hunter is my favorite song on the album and I'm surprised that it wasn't a hit in America, Outlaw is something that reminds me of a lesser known song off of Foreigner's debut album but I take that as a good thing, Rock 'N' Roll Women isn't one of the album's better efforts either and the album ends with a 1 and a half minute song called We Wish You Well.<br />Although I'm only a casual fan of Whitesnake but I think that this is a really good album, although it does have its weak spots but the good songs easily make up for it and this album deserves a well earned 4 stars.
0800177177|4.0|Coppola's telling of Bram Stoker's classic tale is a rather good one, at least compared to many of the vampire movies out there. It does have a gothic or romantic feel to it. Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, and Tom Waits all put in great performances (especially Waits). Not surprisingly Keanu Reeves puts in a particularly dismal performance. He has that tendancy. What was surprising was Cary Elwes performance. Elwes is a wonderful actor, but his work in this film was sub par. What I found particularly disapointing was that there were no special features on this dvd. It would have been nice for Coppola to have had a commentary track. But there is still the film.
B00008PC2O|3.0|Just a note, good dvd, but the high definition media player part has an internet check to see what country you are in!<BR>You can't view the high definition part in the uk!
B000002KDS|5.0|The original Alice Cooper band's reign as kings of the rock world was all too brief, done in by the excesses of stardom and the various band members' personal demons. But in a few short years they delivered some of the finest hard rock ever created, and &quot;Killer&quot; stands out as their best album, stronger than their breakthrough best-seller &quot;Love It To Death&quot;, and not burdened with the overproduction that characterized &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot;. There isn't a weak track on the album. &quot;You Drive Me Nervous&quot; is a punk song written before punk existed. &quot;Dead Babies&quot; is one of the songs that made the band hated by parents all across America (even though the song really concerned child neglect). The most standout track is probably &quot;Desperado&quot;, a tribute to Jim Morrison made all the more eerie by Alice's vocals, which on this song are uncannily reminiscent of Morrison's. Although it is said producer Bob Ezrin later grew frustrated with the rest of the band's playing ability, they are in top form here and back Alice to the max. Guitarists Glen Buxton (RIP) and Mike Bruce trade off unbeatable first-rate riffs while bassist Dennis Dunaway and drummer Neal Smith hold down the bottom. This album is a must have for Alice fans who may not know of his earlier career before his 1980s resurgence with &quot;Trash&quot;. It is a shining example of why many rock listeners believe the 1970s were the golden age of modern rock and roll.
6305508550|5.0|This film is not only hilarious but cathartic. Recommended for anyone, especially anyone who works in corporate America. The film plays off some of the cliches we face in &quot;downsizing&quot; companies. Some of the characters are caricature, yet somehow identifiable with many who infiltrate our work spaces with models, slogans, and the latest buzz words. Office Space is an effective antidote after a work week in a corporate cubicle; some days, it may even replace a happy hour cocktail--well, at least, enhance it.
B000089CKH|5.0|I bought this album because I appreciated two of its hit tracks, &quot;Inside Of Love&quot; and &quot;High Speed Soul.&quot; As I listened to the rest of the tracks, I was blown away by how intelligent and heart-felt they were. Particularly beautiful are &quot;Neither Heaven Nor Space,&quot; &quot;Blonde On Blonde,&quot; and &quot;Blizzard Of '77.&quot; I hear influences by New Order and The Smiths, whether intentional or not, it doesn't matter because it all sounds spectacular. Lyrically this band is very strong and willing to expose their own vulernability, which is what usually grabs at potential fans. This album will quickly become one of your favorites if you listen to it on the level as if you were reading a good book, rather than just needing some ether-effecting, numbing tunes. Sing along! It's more fun that way, too!
0780628551|3.0|Johnny Depp has definitely proven his versatility and his ability to save an otherwise &quot;average&quot; movie---take PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, for instance.  Who else but Depp could have pulled off that Mick Jagger impersonation so effectively?  In ASTRONAUT'S WIFE, however, it is his performance that drags this movie down, and leaves it limp and unmoving.  Charlize Theron, again proving that beauty does not beget banality, does a strong job in her role as the titular heroine, but the movie is so bogged down by slow pacing, an unearnest Depp performance, and no clear sense of direction.<br />Seems like something happened to Depp and his partner on a routine shuttle mission; now that he's back, he's acting a little weird, and lo and behold, Theron is going to have twins.  There's one scene where Depp explains at a dinner party about a new plane he's developing...the lack of coherence in this scene dooms the finale, and the Outer Limits ending does little to tie it up.<br />Bravo to Theron, Clea DuVall and Joe Morton for their impassioned performances, but this is no thriller; it's mainly an exercise in style without substance.
B000000OR9|1.0|You know about all of the Hair Metal bands worth mentioning, from Great White to Extreme...Cinderella to Poison.  This is yet another group with ZERO originality who tried to capitalize on the Hair Metal formula: Power Ballads + Glitter + Spandex + Overplayed/Cliche guitars, divided by Hairspray, multiplied by sissy-prancing onstage.  For some groups this worked...Poison worked it to a science.  But BLUE MURDER?!  WOW!  That is a hardcore name man!  You must sound like Ozzy or Dio or Judas Priest!<br />No, I dont think so.  They sound like all of the other second rate hair bands who, thankfully, were flushed down Nirvana, Mudhoney, and Soundgarden's toilet.<br />I think I saw the Blue Murder lead singer duck into a Hair Club for Men the other day.
B00007KWHO|4.0|The original master of this album was, for reasons best known to the studio engineers at the time, mixed using studio headphones. The result of this is the album has always had a slightly muffled sound which somewhat detracts from the music. Listening on headphones it sounds better. The cleanup work here is good but since the master they had to work on is flawed only so much can be achieved. If you already have this album the cleanup is not that great from the previous CD release, so really only the bonus tracks are the draw and for those the BBC sessions from the same time are much more interesting. <br />Musically this album is well worth it, but the remastering only so so..
B00005JLR8|5.0|This is a really fantastic movie with an amazing cast and a top notch screenplay. This film has gotten some slight criticism for being too sentimental, however I feel the scenes are handled with maturity by the writer/director Jim Sheridan. This film is not for the jaded at heart. It will make a lot of people cry. <br />However, that's not the reason I like this film so much. The characters are very believable and they develop nicely as the film unfolds. The two child actors are simply magnificent, and Paddy Considine is now on my 'actors to watch for' list. Samantha Morton is good too , but then again, when isn't she?<br />The direction in this film is great because the film never feels like it's force feeding you. The actors deliver lines that change the entire complextion of entire scenes and sequences. Enough talk, I highly recommend this film.<br />PS- The 'desperado' sequence is one of the best musical moments in recent film history.
B00005UKE0|5.0|This album has been a favorite of mine ever since it's release in the early 70's. Harrison fans should feel blessed that George got around to overseeing the remastering of this classic before his death. The new mixing is an outstanding improvement over the old CD. Everything is so crisp and clean. It really sounds like it was recorded yesterday instead of 30 years ago. I remember hearing Harrison say in an interview that he prefers a little tape hiss and sure enough, he's left that intact in the remastering which only adds to the warmth of the sound. He's also toned down or removed a lot of Spectors reverb and &quot;lowered&quot; the wall of sound a few inches. The result is wonderful.
B000127LW2|4.0|Star Trek: Voyager, on a whole, was a series of missed opportunities. They had an interesting premise but it was not built on and fell into normal &quot;episodic&quot; television in the later seasons. That said, the first season, while short, was one of the series' best.<br />The show starts out with Caretaker, an episode which has many characteristics of the original series. You have exploring &quot;strange new worlds&quot;, a Vulcan officer, a misunderstood alien and those famous &quot;Starfleet morals.&quot;<br />Over the next few episodes, we get to deal with the duality of the crews and the conflict it causes. But it is soon dropped in favor &quot;anomaly or alien of the week.&quot; That isn't a bad thing, but I would have liked to seen more conflict between the crews this season. And the Kazon are one of the most poorly developed enemies that the Trek lore has even seen.<br />There are some outstanding episodes in this season. Prime Factors deals with the reverse effect of the Prime Directive on the crew and features a fiery reprimand scene at the end. Eye of the Needle has Voyager discovering a worm hole to the Alpha Quadrant. And Heroes and Demons features another malfunctioning holodeck with a fresh new idea and great acting from Robert Picardo.<br />The DVD's feature a crisp picture quality and the sound is excellent (Voyager has one of the best theme songs in the entire Trek history). The extras are good and features the original Janeway scenes filmed. You will see why Mulgrew was brought in. The actual case is a major disappointment, because you have to remove an odd plastic covering before getting to the disks. Why couldn't they've copied the design of Babylon 5 or Deep Space Nine?<br />Voyager Season 1 is a good representation of the way the series would unfold. Through its seven seasons, there isn't much character development and they seem the same in Season 7 as they do in this season. While a bit pricey for only 15 episodes, it is worth the investment for Trek collectors.ment for Trek collectors.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I don't own that many movie soundtracks but I was very excited when I got this one. I absolutely love it, despite some of it's short-comings. The one MAJOR complaint I have is the length: way too short. Cheapie Disney ppl...  The track listings are totally scrambled and mislabeled. Some person did however make a more acurate track listing that I printed out and put in my CD case:<BR>1) Fog bound/Will &amp; Elizabeth<BR>2)Will&amp; Elizabeth/Jack Sparrow appears<BR>3)The Medallion calls/ Jack's near escape<br />4)Swords Crossed<BR>5)The Black Pearl<BR>6)The Black Pearl cont./commandeering the Interceptor<BR>7-10) gets confusing - sailing on interceptor/ Ritual in cave/Elizabeth's rescue/The Pearl gives chase/Battle/Walking the plank<BR>11)Duel in the cave/ Battle on the Dauntless/Jack is cursed<BR>12)Duel/Battle/Elizabeth to the rescue/Last shot<BR>13)Curse is lifted/ Death of Barbossa/Opportune moment/Pearl is gone/ Underwater march  (for some insane reason the Marching Pirates are placed at the end of this track)<BR>14)Jack's rescue/He's a Pirate/ Jack &amp; The Pearl<BR>15) End titles (drastically shortened, if you want the real thing I suggest just recording it off the DVD itself since that's the best part of the soundtrack)<br />When you first listen to the CD it sounds weird w/ lots of what I'd call &quot;crackling&quot; on the booming parts, it probably has something to do the recording but I have found if you have a CD player that has a &quot;live&quot; or orchestra setting, it takes the crackles out. (the mega base seems to make it worse)<br />In any case it's and extreamly moving get-up-and-do-something soundtrack. I can't tell you how much fun it is to listen to. I recently figured out how to play afew of the pieces on the guitar and that's almost as fun ^_^.  If you liked the movie I'd really suggest getting the soudntrack, it's a LOT of fun!<br />-TK
0553382179|5.0|This book is clearly a labor of love.  I know it's changing my life, slowly but surely -- I can look around my home now and feel hopeful and happy, instead of depressed and despairing.  But that's not the only reason you should buy this book.<br />You should buy this book because you don't have to.<br />FLYlady has made all of the information available on her website, and through her mailing list.  It's free.  It's there to help people in CHAOS crisis, even the ones who can't afford to buy the book and are getting their information on the computer at the public library.  And it's changing their lives for the better just like it changed mine.<br />The world gets changed like that, one life at a time.  Women (and men, too, I suppose) don't just clean up their houses with the ideas and advice given in this book, they clean up their acts.  They start taking pride in themselves.  They start getting out of situations where they and their children are endangered because they realize that they deserve better.  They begin to FLY!<br />So I bought this book because I know that those little royalty payments help keep that free outreach going (not to mention that it's great having the whole program laid out in one place).  And the world needs places like flylady.net.
0800130952|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite films.  This fanciful tale of a young girl who escapes into the world of literature from her abusive parents and principal is a must-see for all families.  Some of the material is a little frantic for very young children.  Your children must be mature enough to understand that their school principal will not throw them over a fence by their hair.  <br />The film has wonderful actors in it.  Pam Ferris, as the child-hating principal of Crunchem Hall, put on an enthusiastically over-the-top performance.  Danny De Vito and Rhea Perlman did a great job as the parents who can't understand their six-year-old daughter and her love of reading.  Fresh out of &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; came Embeth Davidtz playing the warm and loving teacher Miss Honey.  And last, but not least, is Mara Wilson, who at a very young age put on a very convincing performance as a girl who loved to learn.<br />Even though the story has some absurdness, it has a wonderful lesson for children.  They shouldn't spend all their time in front of the T.V.  For the film buff's out there, the camera shots are very interesting for a family film.  Composer David Newman (&quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,&quot; &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;) wrote a wonderful music score for the film.  It had humor and sentiment, and it is one of his personal favorites.<br />So if your looking for a good family movie that is average as a film, but above the standards of a family film, this movie is for you.
0553573403|1.0|Beware of this book, and the series beyond it!  I was drawn in by the richly drawn world and characters that seemed interesting.  Although events didn't seem to be unfolding as I had hoped, I kept reading, hoping that something would turn out right in the end.  Midway through the third book in the series, I wish I had never started.<br />Basically, the books are no fun to read because the good guys get the stuffing kicked out of them.  Several major characters that one has grown fond of die to no purpose, and nobody avenges them.  Worse, they die stupidly, from things they should have seen coming.  I don't read books like this to end up feeling bad, and I hope you don't either.
B00007GZR5|4.0|This was actually a pretty good movie. I know it's just a movie and all, but I couldn't get past alot of the new age stuff like reincarnation. The whole movie would have been ten times better without the reincarnation junk.It was not a biblical portrayal of heaven or hell, but it's just a movie so I'm fine with that. The reincarnation just made the entire afterlife thing less permanent. Plus, would they remember their kids when they returned to heaven? Who knows? I really like how heaven and hell are portrayed, though...but this version of heaven is not to be taken seriously.
B0001ADAVK|1.0|This movie is the biggest load of BS I've seen in years.  The script is incredibly weak and tremendous young actors are wasted.  I beleive Julia Roberts thinks that she's this woman but I just couldn't buy into her charater.  Also, I just got sick of watching the longing looks of Roberts.  It was bad acting.  <br />If you want to see a movie that tackles this exact same subject in an intelligent fashion I recommend &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; with Maggie Smith.  Ms. Smith won an Academy Award for her performance.
B0000C7GG2|4.0|This CD is finally being released on March 24, 2004 here in Canada.  So I assume it will be in the U.S too, not too sure about that.  But if you can get it, definitely recommended.  And now that it will become a non-import CD it shouldn't be too hard for you to get it!<BR>You won't regret listening to it, definitely not Radiohead-esque.  Voice, perhaps but stylistically they're very unique.  I dig Bellamy's semi-orchestral piano skills in some of his songs. Lyrics are a bit lacking, but their instrumentation and uniqueness definitely makes up for it.
B00005JN1L|3.0|After chowing down a deliciously handmade waffle cone made with premium homemade ice cream at a wonderful local dive known as Bubbie's Ice Cream (located at the Koko Marina Shopping Center in beautiful Hawaii Kai, in case you're interested & if you happen to journey out into that particular vicinity, by all means, stop in! ), a plaque containing various movie reviews happened to catch my wandering eye on my way out the door. Except, in place of gold stars, a rating system comprised of waffle cone tips was substituted instead. A small group of movies playing at the 8-plex across the street adorned this slab of maple oak. Perusing the list, I came across \\"Secret Window\\", which I noticed was given a two waffle cone tip out of a maximum of four tip rating, which suggests an average assessment. Curious to see if Bubbie's assessment was correct, I headed over to the theater nearby and purchased my ticket (along with the \\"required\\" assortment of refreshments), then made my way up the lobby stairs to my theater destination, and sat down in my spacious theater-style seat. After sitting through some amusing \\"commercials\\" and previews, the moment of truth would finally arrive. But, would my vague expectations uncannily match those of Bubbie? \\"Secret Window\\", based on the Stephen King novel \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\", is like studying a grand master painting by Monet, Da Vinci, Rembrandt and associates. All the brilliant physical brushstrokes, in combination with vivid colors and subtle imagery are present, but you wonder if there's more beneath the surface. Those were my exact thoughts while viewing \\"Secret Window\\". Upon further in(tro)spection, I noticed that all of the elements which were usually contained within many previously released feature-length horror films are also present here: including an intense plot featuring a main subject (a mystery writer played adaquately by Johnny Depp), a menacing, lurking antagonist (featuring a masterful portrayal by John Turturro), including various other supporting subjects (good turns all nicely done by Dennis Quaid, Maria Bello, Charles S. Dutton and Len Cariou). But, unlike the inquisitive early-period masters listed above, there's very little structural mind-stretching content to be found underneath the film's well-meaning premise. \\"SW\\"'s storyline's lighweight script and often shallow character references suggest the overall theme doesn't want to dangle about merrilly, but just wants to lie still, taking an occasional coffee break in the process. The film's schizophrenic subject matter doesn't help matters much either, and by film's end, one is left to think while scratching his or her head: \\"This is IT?!!?\\", wondering if spending their hard-earned money on this very average at-best movie was actually worthy of any notable effort. As it turned out, Bubbie's assessment of \\"Secret Window\\" actually met my expectations, and was right on the money as a whole. For those expecting a Stephen King portrayal chock-full of intensity and all-out insanity, overall, there are a few brief, shining, over-the-top moments contained within, but, when all is said and done, one will consider \\"Secret Window\\" to be nothing of special importance or significance, for that matter. Also of note, I found out that Bubbie and I have very similar tastes in movies, as per the review display inside the establishment (example: \\"50 First Dates\\" was given a four out of four cone rating, \\"Hidalgo\\" a three out of four cones, etc.). However, I tended to disagree on his two cone rating of \\"Spartan\\", as the plot featured within that stellar motion picture contained more vim and bite than \\"Secret Window\\", which was given the exact same rating Bubbie had given \\"Spartan\\", as previously mentioned. Oh, well, we can't agree on everything, can we? I discovered the Bubster has excellent artistic taste in music as well, as Joni Mitchell's \\"Court and Spark\\" album was playing over the stereo when I convened upon his establishment two days earlier. How about some Neil Diamond the next time I come in to your fine establishment, Bubs? Maybe we can take in a movie over at the 8-plex while we're at it? It would be my treat!s earlier.

B000025H0Q|5.0|I'll go out on a limb and just hope that everyone knows that feeling where you're happy through and through and yet there's this deep seated hinting towards a desperate need to cry. I've yet to find a word for it, but whatever the word is, that's what this album is. Musically, there's incredible talent. The lyrics are heads above most. But mostly, it's the feeling that you get out of this.
0441172717|5.0|This is one of those books you read over and over again, because each time you get a little bit more out of it.  Highly recommended.  I wouldn't bother with the rest of the series, though, as Herbert went off on rambling tangents that lost the basic sci-fi basis of the story.

I gave them a chance, I wasn't expecting to be knocked on my butt. Nirvana and NeverMind, especially, changed music forever, killing metal and saving the melody.  Nevermind is a masterful blend of punk rock and heavy grunge, not to mention the harsh heartfelt vocals of Kurt Cobain.  The Greatest drummer of all time Dave, or as my brother would say, \\"G-d\\" and Krist.  Together they created some of the best written songs of all time, \\"Smells like teen spirit, Something In The Way, etc.\\"  With some of the greatest songs ever they took the world by storm and saved music, thanks Nirvana. <BR>RIPKC
B00005NWM3|3.0|You've gotta love how you remind me and never again. They rock. But it's songs like Just for and Too Bad that make it worse. You may have a totally different oppinion. I mean I like the cd and all, it's just a few songs that are kinda bad. They really rock it out on how you remind me and Never Again, which is my favorite. I still say you wouldn't be wasting money if you bought this cd. Oh yeah! Check out number 6 on this cd, called Hollywood. Great song. See more of my reviews on Linkin Park's Meteora and Hybrid Theory. See ya later rock fans!

B00009L1TA|1.0|This movie has a relatively interesting premise with good actors and relatively good execution.  The problem with this movie is that it makes no sense.<br />If you like plain action, this might be ok, however, I found myself pausing this movie every ten seconds to ask the person I was watching it with what had just happened.   The movie consists of the same scene repeated ten times, from a different point of view.<br />The characters are believable, the only problem is that the watcher has no idea what is to be believed.  The twists are so numerable, and minor characters unknown and vague that it is impossible to follow.  (Toward the end two characters even switch names!)

0553208845|5.0|The title character of Siddhartha is an exceptionally intelligent Brahman, the highest caste in Hindu society, with a bright future mapped out ahead of him. Nevertheless, he is plagued by a sense of hollowness that cannot be quelled by conventional success. As with the legendary story Gotama Buddha (from which Hesse no doubt draws heavily), Siddhartha embarks on a journey of self-discovery that takes him through a period of asceticism and self-denial followed by one of near hedonistic sensual indulgence. However, neither asceticism, an encounter with Buddha, nor forays into love and business can satiate Siddhartha's quest for spiritual enlightenment. He continues the search, ultimately finding peace and enlightenment by a river, under the guidence of a humble ferryman. Although the narrative of Siddhartha's life parallels the legendary Buddha's in many ways, the form and content of Siddhartha's enlightenment are unique, differing greatly from that of the Buddha. Rather than merely extrapolating from the tenets of Buddhism, Hesse provides his own unique contribution to the living tradition - his own sutra, if you will - and the result is amazing. A profoundly important and beautiful little book that will fundamentally change you worldview for the better.<br />\\"He saw all these forms and faces in a thousand relationships to each other, all helping each other, loving, hating, destroying each other and become newly born. Each one of them was mortal, a passionate, painful example of all that was transitory. Yet none of them died, they only changed, were always reborn, continually had a new face: only time stood between one face and another.\\"

Own all the Next Generation boxed sets etc.<br />The show itself was humerous, engaging and entertaining. You really care for the people and characters in this series. Unlike most of the drek sold to the public these days as entertainment these folks felt like family. Okay, maybe not the one you want on public display, but they are ones you who while not upright and totally respectable are the ones you secretly hope will show up for the family reunion to give the rest of you stay at home folks something to talk about for years to come.
B00018D44U|5.0|I have listen to the CD, I own the CD and I think that it's great. I absolutely loved &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; with the exception of a few songs and I believe that her latest CD is no different. It's wonder, great to listen to and beautifully put together. I have to agree with Thomas R. Hrdlick &quot;home indeed&quot; when he said that he didn't understand why people were saying that it was a disappointment when the CD is the perfect follow up to &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. I'm 14 years old and I only listen to RnB and Rap so for me to say that I thought the CD was an amazing is definitely saying something.
0385504209|1.0|I know, I know it's a suspense book and you're not supposed to take it too seriously.  I disagree.  Fiction is really the best way to spread a theory that is otherwise too hot to handle in the mainstream - and believe me, we ARE talking theory, here.<br />I know you've read some incredible things about Mary Magdalene and her fling with Jesus the Christ in THE DA VINCI CODE by educated Harvard writer Dan Brown.<br />Many of these theories come out of a well-financed (Hollywood financed!) minority of revisionist scholars whom the press sees as more exciting when they are, in fact, just speculating.<br />Consider the non-fiction work of twenty-year New Testament scholar Donald Spoto &quot;The Hidden Jesus&quot;.  In Chapter 14 he rules out many of the theories that discount what happened at Christ's Tomb (Mind you, this book is not sold at Christian book stores - he merely represents 70-80 percent of real scholars' opinions):<br />&quot;....other fantasies have Jesus meeting up with Mary Magdalene and hopping off to Spain, where they marry, settle down, raise a family - and presumably work on their memoirs or obtain a Gucci francise.  This is the stuff of Hollywood, not of historical-religious exploration.  Need I add that, for tales like this, there is, of course, not a shred of reliable historical evidence?.......No, the best historical judgement to make on the tradition is that things happened  as they are written.  There is very much in favor of that, and nothing against it.&quot;<br />I just want to be sure that a decision for or against the craziness depicted in Brown's book and many others is made based on an educated opinion, not a sensationalist one or one because the Catholic Church sucks.<br />I couldn't get around the hyberbola hocus-pocus that he presents as fact.  I'm sure if he could comment he would say &quot;Well....it is!&quot; But he presents his theory to people who barely have time to entertain themselves with a book - much less learn Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek to discount him.  It's 'Best Seller's list' status makes me want to buy a newspaper franchise because It's going to take a hundred years to educate the public properly on what most real scholars believe: a truth so apparent, so clear that it doesn't make good TV.<br />I give the book 0 stars for Yellow Journalism.and Greek to discount him.

0393325172|4.0|I was compelled to read MASTER AND COMMANDER after seeing the excellent 2003 film of the same title starring Russell Crowe. The movie is loosely based - I stress loosely - on the book.<br />Author Patrick O'Brian quickly gets down to business. Within the first twenty-five pages, Lieutenant Jack Aubrey, RN, is assigned captaincy of the His Majesty's sloop &quot;Sophie&quot;, and he discovers a new friend in Dr. Stephen Maturin, a physician sans patients marooned in Minorca, whom Jack persuades to come aboard his vessel as its new medical officer. (At this point, it must be stressed that Stephen is a &quot;physician&quot;, not a &quot;surgeon&quot;, the latter profession held in low esteem as being not much better than that of a meat-cutter.) It's 1800, and England is embroiled in one of its interminable wars with France and Spain.<br />In the book as in the film, there are three themes. Ranked in importance, there is first the friendship between Aubrey and Maturin. Then, the depiction of Aubrey as a man and commander. And finally, the naval strategy, battles, and life aboard a wooden fighting ship.<br />Jack's an interesting character; in the book MASTER AND COMMANDER, he's still a diamond in the rough. He's brave, fair to his men, professionally ambitious, a competent sailor, lucky, and desirous of wealth. (Remember, in these times, the poorly paid crew and officers of a military man o' war could derive much, if not most, of their remuneration from the capture of &quot;prize ships&quot;, i.e. vessels flying an enemy's flag subsequently sold, with their cargoes, for profit by the Admiralty.) Most of all, Aubrey wants to advance up the pay-grade ladder into the admiral ranks. However, he tends to be insubordinate and, in MASTER AND COMMANDER at least, he's having an affair with his immediate superior's wife - the latter a potentially career-scuttling move.<br />For me, this volume isn't of the can't-put-down type.

B000021YQV|5.0|BUY IT NOW!  DON'T WAIT!<BR>At first this cd did not click with me.  After one month and a few more listens I started to warm up to it fast.  Then Wham...it hit me hard.  This CD just ROCKS!  It slams you hard and does not let go at all.  The progressive-hard core, cutting edge, political songs just blow all other albums out of the water.  It is so refreshing to hear something new ....something better than the tired tripe on the radio.  If you have only heard Toxicity,Chop Suey and Aerials then you are in for a wonderful ride.  It is a MUST have.  It is even better than their 1st album. Give it a chance.  It will be more than worth it. I personally like the first 6 songs the best (see the other reviews for the titles), but the rest of the album is no slouch.  I always have it around now.  It has moved up in my cd rotation to the top tier!
6300214753|5.0|I've seen this movie umpteen times, and each time I feel more and more nostalgia for a bygone era that seemed simpler and more innocent.  It's just a great, fun, entertaining movie that subtly manages to convey a few deep meanings about life and how it should be lived.  A classic, timeless 80s flick that I'll never tire of watching.
B00008EYA5|5.0|The movie, I felt, was amazing.  Good plot, great characters, and well done special effects. The only thing that tarnished the movie was some lines the characters were saying was just cheesy (but that was only in about 3 different parts).  Still it didn't lose any stars from me because the movie was too good and therefore 3 bad lines does not even compare to the whole movie. 5 Stars All The Way!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin has done it again! You have to admit that the man is a genius! I truly admire his style and how he has no boundaries in keeping the script as real as it can possibly get. This movie is mesmerising from beginning to end- I think the hottest part was how he integrated japanese anime into the storyline. I can't wait to see what else he has in store.....this movie was worth the nine dollars & five years waiting for the man to do it again.
0553274503|5.0|This is such a beautiful book, full of hope and longing at the same time.  The story is upsetting though, for it shows us the stupid side of human nature.  Anyone interested in adversity and how human beings overcome it should read this book.  <br />There are three &quot;musts&quot; for anyone interested in a great story, such as this:  Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and this book, FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON.  Of all of these, FLOWERS is by far my favorite, but the others are good as well.
0345347951|5.0|\\"Childhood's End\\" is one of the best novels of the 20th century.  Arthur C. Clarke is one of the best writers of the period.   <br />Many scenes from this book have been cribbed into the public consensuses over the years via Hollywood movies, some good and some bad.  The most specific image copied from it is that of the giant space ship hovering over cities... done so whacked out well in the movie \\"Independence Day\\".  Of course, there the aliens were evil invaders rather than the benevolent Overlords.  Other ideas that morphed from this novel into Hollywood flicks were in the films 2001 and 2010.  Of course, Clarke was directly involved with both of those, so they were much more faithful to the source materials.   And naturally, Clarke's influences are seen in Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5 and other Hollywood SF series over the years.  <br />The major question dealt with here is \\"where are we going?\\" as a species.   The weirdness is that many people don't like the answer Clarke attempts to give here. I, myself, don't find it an appealing concept.  I am not sure what I don't like about it other than that it seems Alien to me.  Very alien. Which is why this is great SF... Clarke makes us feel that we humans can be aliens to ourselves, and not in a normal way.   It is something that I think Asimov himself hooked into with his later Foundation novels and the Gaia concept... but Clarke did it first. <br />Clarke, along with other writers like Isaac Asimov, Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, Theodore Sturgeon, Fredrik Pohl, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison, and several others, made the future what, in many ways, it has become. <br />Clarke has written many other novels on, somewhat, the same concepts... \\"2001:A Space Odyssey\\", \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" and \\"The City and the Stars\\" standing out, with this novel, as, in my opinion, his best work.   Read this book for something that is more mature in outlook than the usual Hollywood faire that gets the sci-fi label.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|As a teenager in the sixties, I had already made my mind up to be a photographer, but this film influenced me into being comfortable in the profession of a photographic artist, which in turn has given me a wonderful life adventure on a creative rollercoaster. I hadn't seen this film for many years but upon review I find it dated for today's audiences, yet for me it still holds up as an icon of the 1960s.<br />David Hemmings plays a photographer, a dreamer, a curious individual who lives the busy life of a high-flier, photographic artist, much like the popular London photographers of the time; David Hamilton and David Bailey. He treats his work as a part of everyday life, as with most artists, but he also has the arrogance of someone who is good at what he does, and knows it. The film is very European in many ways yet it became popular cultural in the London of the sixties.<br />The art of photography is about imagination and make-beleive, and so is the world of Blow Up where nothing is exactly as it seems. It is all manufactured, including the truth. Is it there? Yes. No it isn't, so lets make-believe it is, or lets make it happen. In this uncertain world the photographer suddenly stumbles on a mystery where he tries to uncover the elusive truth, but he then becomes unraveled by the enigma of what truth is. Is it there or not?<br />People have been trying to find meaning in this film for years but Blow Up is an ethereal romp where nothing is as it seems. So if in the end the meaning is meaningless, just enjoy the ride. <br />Sorry, but the commentary track is senseless. Don't know who did it but it comes from someone trying to find meaning. And that's his problem. Turn it off and enjoy the film.<br />Blow Up is a \\"FAB\\" film, definitely high on my list.
0375703861|4.0|still in the middle of it but i like it a LOT so far.  writing is very witty and its a fun read.  i'm not really sure where its going but the second generation is hilarious.
B00000G3PA|4.0|This movie is fun, a little less serious than Deep Impact which came out about the same time, yet it had it's own perspective and plot.<br />Interesting concept using a well drilling team to place charges on a large asteroid.<br />Much of the movie involves the relationships of those on Willis's drilling team.  There is comaraderie and infighting, yet, they get more serious as they get closer to take off and the rendezvous with meteor.<br />The special effects are a little more spectacular than those on Deep Impact, yet the scenes on the meteor itself are a little bit unreal.<br />The cast is an interesting broad spectrum of characters, many whom have come into their own since Armageddon.  I think for special effects and action Armageddon is much better than Deep Impact, yet the plot and story of the latter is much better.<br />Armageddon though does show a group of very tough men with a challenging job ahead of them, taking things both in stride and with a sense of confidence.
B000002MU3|3.0|&quot;Monster&quot; was R.E.M.'s experiment with big guitars and grungy sounds to keep up pace with all the young whipper-snappers of the &quot;alternative era&quot; that had been influenced by Athens, Georgia's finest. <BR>Beginning with the throbbing, distorted chords of &quot;What's the Frequency, Kenneth?,&quot; it seems as though &quot;Monster&quot; is a real monster of an album. There are some good songs, as there are on any R.E.M. album, but the last half of the album lacks the instant appeal of the first half. &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; sounds a bit like their older stuff, which is great nonetheless, but sounds a bit out of place here. &quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot; and &quot;Star 69&quot; have enough hooks to remain in your head for days, and &quot;King of Comedy&quot; is one of the many uses of Michael Stipe's vocal in a previously unheard way. Overall, this is a good album, and of course, it was hard to come up with a followup to &quot;Automatic for the People,&quot; but this would have done as just a six-song EP for a better effect, either that or just &quot;big rock songs&quot; all the way through.
0385510438|5.0|Set in a small Mississippi town in the 70s, this latest Grisham novel is a culmination of everything that has come before.  We often complain when our favorite authors get in a rut, producing the same story over and over, then we complain when they change styles.  <br />But the most interesting aspect of THE LAST JUROR is the fact that Grisham has managed to combine the best of his legal thrillers with the down-home feel of other books like SKIPPING CHRISTMAS or A PAINTED HOUSE.  <br />THE PELICAN BRIEF, this book is not, but then that wasn't what Grisham intended.  Instead, it is a more literary attempt to meld his styles and it works wonderfully.<br />Also recommended:  McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and POMPEII
B000002I2G|4.0|1969's &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; is easily the Doors' most controversial album, with the band incorporating horns &amp; strings to some of the tracks. It's certainly a different album from anything the group had done before, and, admittedly, it's not entirely successful. Some fans understandably balked, but I think the Doors should nonetheless be commended for taking the risk. Is &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; their greatest work? No, but it still contains a lot of great Doors music. &quot;Touch Me&quot; is an all-time Doors classic, one of the band's biggest hits, and it's still played very consistently on rock radio to this day. The 8 minute-40 second title rock suite that closes the album is a marvelous tour-de-force, and just as powerful as any of the Doors' other rock epics, like &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;When The Music's Over.&quot; Other winners are the spooky grooves of &quot;Shaman's Blues,&quot; the catchy psychedelic rock of &quot;Wild Child,&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Wishful Sinful.&quot; Only two tracks, in my opinion, fall flat---&quot;Do It&quot; is just meandering filler, and &quot;Runnin' Blue&quot; is sunk by a silly-sounding country/western chorus. But other than that, this is still a very good Doors album, featuring Jim Morrison's legendary master-of-ceremonies voice (and intriguing lyrics), Robbie Krieger's tasty guitar hooks, Ray Manzarek's awesome keyboard work, and John Densmore keeping the drumbeat firm and tough. &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; is the Doors bravely jumping off a musical cliff somewhat, and sure, they got a little bit bruised in the process. But in the end, they still came up with a daring, different, darn good rock album. And I do admire that.
1577311523|5.0|I don't know what other people think about this book, and I think people will always have different feeling and thoughts about things. It totally depends on how you relate to the book. For myself, this book really touched me, and I can easily relate to Tolle's words. And it really did save me from one of the most terrible time of my life. I did get out of my own created pains and misery by stop dwelling into the past and not thinking about the future, which creates the fear and worries. I'm only living for the present moment and focus on it.
B00005JME0|3.0|This reminded me of DONNIE DARKO. It wasn't as good as Donnie, but it was very interesing, and kept you involved in the story. Ashton Kutcher wasn't bad in his first dramatic role. Needless to say, I was very surprised. Even though it was very predictable at times, there was always a twist or two that you didn't see coming. Very weird.<br />Recommended!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|When I saw Master and Commander my expectations were that is was going to be a simple action movie.  To my surprise I felt like I was on the journey of my life to the Far Side of the World.<br />From the East Coast of South America, to the Antarctic, to the islands and beyond, this movie is as exciting as any high seas drama there has been.  The close quarters of the film when on board make you feel a little heavy. There was not much room below decks or even above when all the men were aboard.<br />The interesting scenes between the commander and his men, the interplay of crew and officers and the battle scenes will draw you in if you let them.<br />Having toured empty tall ships, this was enlightening to see how cramped quarters they had.  The movie will take you on a journey with the crew, making decisions that seem at times to contradict what was promised just before.  But for duty and honour....<br />I cannot wait to get the DVD to see the other features about the movie that was one of my favorites in '03.
B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M.'s masterpiece &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; is the rare record that transcends time and space (and current fads.) The band toned down the volume on this record to great effect--a funereal atmosphere permeates almost every cut, and it is a great introspective, reflective album from opening track to the closing. Michael Stipe's lyrics are sublime. Whether he's quoting David Essex on &quot;Drive,&quot; the opening track, or singing about Montgomery Clift and Andy Kaufman (&quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal&quot; and &quot;Man on the Moon,&quot; respectively) Stipe's lyrics and vocals had never been so pronounced or brilliant (up to this point.) And of course, there is the album's big hit, &quot;Everybody Hurts,&quot; which is jammed packed with emotion with both the lyrics and Stipe's quavering voice. &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; is an automatically enchanting piece of music.
B00013F38K|5.0|I bought this the day of the release and couldnt hardly wait to watch it. For those who are so worried about the wide screen, let me tell you. It's been cut up from the 4.3 TV modification. Your not going to get the orginal widescreen or the studio version.<BR>I have a copy I recorded twelve years ago and compared it right away. Yes it's cropped off on both top and bottom, but it's okay.<BR>The Picture is great, the sound is great, especially for the time period. <BR>So sit back and relax and enjoy whats there. I would much rather<BR>have this in this widescreen version than fullscreen anyday.<BR>My 16x9 set and I are very happy. Besides it's now very <BR>expensive. &quot;The day you can snatch the DVD from my hand you will be ready to leave&quot;
076790592X|5.0|There are so many people that agree with me on this that is was one of the only books i have ever read that i just couldnt put down i always wanted to know that mitch and morrie were going to talk about next this book made me think and has shown me that everyone gets old and dies but there are so many diffrent ways to go about this. morrie you would think would just let himself pass but he doesnt he teaches mitch and so many other people that even though you may be dieing you can make the best of it by showing other people that you can help by passing all you have to do is taslk to the ones that are younger than you and show them the way i have never read a book that is better than this one get book R.I.P Morrie
B00006879E|4.0|I really liked this album. Like Ebert, I would give it thumbs up!  The singer sounds alot like Terrence Trent D'arby, very soulful, and mixes well with the bands very funky and quirky sound.  I'm keeping it simple, I liked the album and will enjoy listening to it again and again.
B00005JN1L|4.0|This was a very good suspense film, and I have to say that Johnny Depp turns in another great performance. John Tuturro is great as well, and his scary hick character, Shooter, is very creepy. David Koepp is a good director and screenwriter. See STIR OF ECHOES and PANIC ROOM for good examples of this. I really liked the twist at the end, and even though you will think that you've seen it all before, you should not come out feeling disappointed with it. I thought it was extremely creepy in a very quirky way...if that makes any sense.<br />Anyways, great performances and a good script make this worth the ticket price.<br />Recommended!
B00003CXTG|5.0|This DVD is excellent.  Even the scenes as you wait between movie or other features is enjoyable.<br />Affleck and Harnett have a great relationship in the movie and there are some interesting twists in the film.  I think the hallmarks of the film were the obvious attack on Pearl itself which will actually rock you.  Even the DVD was powerful in that respect.  I do not have a wide screen, yet the DVD did not take away from the impact of the attack scene.  Alec Baldwin as Doolittle also plays an interesting part in the film.<br />The addition of the Doolittle raid gives the film a sense of completion.  Most Pearl Harbor type movies end with proclamations, but this ends with the response to Tokyo.  That actually added to the flick.  There was a war after this attack on America who was really sleeping.<br />Even the length was interesting.  It actually added to the movie.  I think it would have been a rather barren movie if it was shorter.  The relationships in the movie were touching and sensible.  Cuba Gooding as our cook turned hero 'Dorie Miller' does a credible job of blending into the movie just as Dorie Miller blends perfectly into the history of the attack.<br />This DVD is very interesting with the additional features especially touching is the unsung heroes of Pearl.<br />This movie is a testimony to the sense of Pearl Harbor history, there are some areas where, though not perfect have a tendency toward reality.  Even John Voight as Roosevelt starts out a little edgy, yet develops into character.<br />I liked Pearl Harbor and will enjoy this movie from time to time thinking deeply about the impact that the loss of lives had on our nation.
B00008J4P5|5.0|music that has come out in.  Forget the strokes .. these kids are the real deal.
B00000K2SC|5.0|When I first saw this movie I thought sucked. What an understatement! I saw this movie a second and third time and thought it was great! Now I'm hooked and I want this movie. A very wooden Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Aderson a worker for a computer software company. He is also the computer hacker Neo. He meets up with Trinity and she takes him to Morpheus. Neo then learns his world is just a computer simulation. The only problem with the movie is it wouldn't seem to end! Trinity and Neo save Morpheus from Agents but Agent Smith corners them and Neo gets side-tracked, this adds about 20 minutes to the movie but it's the best part!
0440238609|5.0|A rare gem in the science fiction/fantasy genre, this series has a female heroine, Lyra.  We follow Lyra throughout the series as she encounters intense mysteries and drama.  Although this is a fantasy book series, it is superbly written and is excellent in making the reader become so engrossed that they nearly forget where they are.<br />I would use these books with high school, reluctant reader girls, since it's an excellent story about a girl who saves the world.  They would learn from this book that girls are also craft, witty, and brilliant.  Another group that I would recommend this series to are advanced high school readers as I believe these books have direct references to Paradise Lost and also make general remarks on religion.  In fact by the final book, your idea of religion is completely obscured.  I think it would be interesting for them to do a compare/contrast with Paradise lost of perhaps how the series develops a theme of religion.
B000068FUS|5.0|I purchased this album last June along with Decoration Day and Alabama Ass Wuppin.  While impressed with the last two, Southern Rock Opera is well, if I do say so myself, pure geineous.  As one reviewer stated, my first thoughts were one of apprehension and borderline disappointment but after futher listening, the CD has not been out of my truck since.  Furthermore, I saw them last September and just last month in concert.  These guys are the real deal on album and in concert.  Lyrically this album in nothing less than brilliant and musically nothing less than phenominal.  If their is anybody out here who has no idea who the Drive-By-Truckers are, than all I can say is you need to go put a bullet in your head.
6305232660|5.0|Interesting that so many would call this a shallow movie.  Based on a concept of Near Earth Objects, Deep Impact has a potential deep impact on the viewer.<br />There are a few interesting vignettes when it comes to relationships being effected by this rather large comet headed toward impact with earth.  From the start with Beiderman, played by one of our heroes, Elijah Wood, responsible for discovering the Comet and Martin Smith (American Grafitti and the Untouchables) playing Wolf.  The Comet is named Wolf-Beiderman after these two, Wolf dies and you wonder how long it would be before the comet is really discovered.<br />However, Tea Leoni, playing newscaster want-to-be/reporter, discovers a cover-up that leads to an interesting intrigue with President Tom Beck, played by Morgan Freeman.<br />The movie develops quickly after that and the plot is very interesting.  You need to look at the relationships of Robert Duvall and his crew, Leoni, her family and friends, Wood and his loved ones.  This is a key to the success of the movie.<br />The concept of the Comet is really the come-on to get people to really get into the characters.  There are some interesting scenes with Earth being impacted and the final scene is very convincing.  However, the most important part of the movie was the relationships, as life seemed to come to an ebb for most of the population of earth, what will people be like?  Would there be sacrifice or selfishness.<br />Duvall plays a very interesting part.  As an older pilot/astronaut, he leads a group of young brash space crew who grow up quickly on their mission.<br />The movie is exciting and engaging.  The DVD extras add to the movie experience as well.<br />This DVD is worth having in your DVD library and worth a watch every now and then.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I simply dig all of Taratino's movies a true story telling genus. The guy is creative. The action is A+, although the story is nothing new he still redefines it to be unique and stylish. The over exaggerated blood is humerous yet it's needed. This movie reminds me a lot of the 70's Kung Fu movies like The Big Boss and Seven Samurai. The Shaw Brothers style zoom in close ups are so artistic. And fight secenes are apreciated for it's artistic vision. A simply loved Uma Thurman when she sported the yellow biker suit, like Bruce Lee did in GAME OF DEATH ( a favorite of mine). I a big fan of Martial Arts films and since the MATRIX's sequel sucked so bad KILL BILL helps give us Americans hope to make more Martial Arts films. Because everyone knows the Asian made ones are much better even with subtitle. KILL BILL is buy you should make I know I am. If you liked PULP FICTION, JACKIE BROWN, RESERVOIR DOGS, or NATURAL BORN KILLERS, you absolutely fal in love with KILL BILL.

0141301066|5.0|Since Roald Dahl published his first childrens book, The Gremlins in 1943, children as well as adults have enjoyed his mystical fun-filled adventures.  Dahls use of language and character development has earned him a spot among the greatest childrens writers.  Matilda is no exception.  The book is a series of mischievous, clever, funny, and sometimes heartbreaking circumstances where the reader becomes completely captivated by Matilda.<br />Matilda is a child genius stuck with her less than idyllic parents and brother.  Her father is a used car salesman who more than fits into the typical view of this sort.  Her mother is a bingo addict.  Both of her parents find immense satisfaction in watching the telly and eating TV dinners.  They are also very confused and upset that Matilda spends her time reading; they feel its distracting their nightly routine.  <br />Matilda learns to read on her own with the help of the local librarian who gives her suggestions on what to read.  In a very short period of time Matilda has read every childrens book in the library and has moved on to adult literature.  She accomplishes all of this before even entering school.<br />Her parents find Matilda as a major thorn in their sides,  a scab, and continually do horrific things to her.  Her dad yells, calls her names, and doesnt listen to her all the while treating his son as a prince.  Matilda decides to get back at her parents by using creative methods.  These include using items like super glue and parrots.  The reactions that ensue from the practical jokes are hilarious and make the reader somewhat envious that they didnt do the exact same thing when they were 4.<br />We follow Matilda through her adventures in school and her experiences with the dreaded Miss. Trunchbull and the wonderful teacher, Miss. Honey.  Matilda fits right in and even though its evident to everyone that shes a genius, her classmates still love her.  Her biggest dilemma is the school principal, Miss. Trunchbull with whom she fulfills her most creative and daring practical revenge.<br />Dahls expert use of language and dramatic situations make this a perfect book to read aloud to your class.  Students will love the witty comments and acts Matilda uses and their imagination will soar to jokes theyd like to complete in their own lives.  Quentin Blakes magical illustrations are the perfect complement to the story.  Kids and adults will both like this book and find themselves re-reading it many times.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|A truly exquisite masterpiece from the genius of Tim Burton.  Beautifully crafted, superbly acted and leaviung an audience with tears of joy.  Finney as always is perfect in the role of the older man.  Ewan Mcgregor compliments the older actor with his interpretation of the younger man. Jessica Lange doesn't get enough screen time, but what she has she steals.  With an array of great character actors in the supporting cast I defy anyone to watch this modern fable and not come away moved.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie is said by many as confusing.  Well the truth is, this movie was one of the best movies in the last 5 years.  The movie does not seem like a movie, it feels like a documentry.  This movie will not feed you a simple hollywood plot, so if you watch movies to be entertained, dont watch it, it will only bore you.  It is a simple plot, but not for the simple person.  If you havent allready noticed, I loved this movie.   It has a great love story, and the acting is seemless.  After watching this movie I couldnt stop thinking about it, it was just a great film.  For people who say its quirky, your wrong.  Quirky films dont get nomanations for best picture, there is a difference.  See this movie!
B00004YZFR|4.0|Okay, so the film has to be valued as a piece of cinema verite capturing a nightmarish moment in countercultural history, but going on 35 years later, I'm still waiting for the Stones tour documentary that was, after all, the original intent of having the Maysleses & Co. around the Stones at all.  <br />This \\"anniversary edition\\" of the film offers a ray of hope in the form of a few snippets of outtake material - the scenes from the Muscle Shoals studio in particular are a real joy (and bravo, guys, for showing you *were* capable of noticing somebody besides Mick Jagger for at least a few seconds!).  <br />So where's the rest?  By all accounts the Stones' performance at Altamont was brilliant - they didn't just stop playing and flee, as this film misleadingly suggests.  Granted, the events at Altamont turned the film into something other than originally anticipated - but that story's been told already, and the movie's gathered its due laurels.  Now can we *please* finally see the rest of the Stones' concert??  <br />I'm sure I'm not the only one who would value that miles more than the interminable self-congratulatory \\"commentaries\\" the filmmakers tacked onto this edition (really, who *cares* that you adore Mick's scarf?!).  The remastering job is very fine, though, so ... all right, four stars.  I'll save the fifth one for when you let us have the Stones.  <br />(And for the record, re another reviewer's remarks: That's not Andrew Oldham, who had long since parted ways with the Stones, it's Sam Cutler, their road manager; and there were no Stones hanging around in any \\"local civic offices\\" - what an idea!)
0694003611|3.0|Can't say that either my 16-month old daughter or I were ever that keen on this book.  The pictures never caught my daughter's eye and there are other books with much better rhymes.  I got a much better reaction from my daughter with books by Eric Caryle, Dr. Seuss, Sandra Boynton, Richard Scarry, and Karen Katz.  She often comes to me carrying a book by one of these other authors so I could read it to her, but she's never voluntarily picked up this one.
0812550706|5.0|Winner of the Nebula and Hugo Awards, Ender's Game is a fascinating story kids will want to read over and over.  Ender is a brilliant kid who gets made fun of because he is different.  He eventually is chosen to go to a special school where he learns how to become the general who will save humanity from invading aliens.  Throughout his journey Ender overcomes many obstacles while fighting to maintain his humanity.<br />Kids will love this book because they will identify with Ender.  Everyone knows how it feels to be an outsider, and Ender shows how the things that make us different, are often our strengths.  This is an incredibly imaginative book, and the plot will keep kids interested right from the start.  It is intended for older readers, as the graphic style of some violent scenes might frighten younger kids.  It is this style though that allows the book to convey its message so successfully to an age of children that are often hard to reach.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I love this movie so much that it's surprised me that I've taken so long to review it. But this movie is GREAT!<br />It's about two girls, Susan Evers and Sharon Mckendrick, who meet at summer camp, and are shocked and surprised to find out that not counting their hairstyles, they look exactly alike! The initial curiosity leads to feuding and the girl's wind up in an isolation tent alone...for the rest of the summer.<br />Rain, wind, and an open window eventually break the ice, and Susan and Sharon begin to get to know each other. But when Sharon shows Susan a picture of her mother, Susan instantly recognizes it as her mother, and the girls discover that they are SISTERS!!!!!!!<br />To make a long story short, Susan and Sharon switch places in a wild attempt to get their parents back together. But their plans are nearly crashed when their dad announces his intent to marry a vain, uppity lady named Vicky. Can Susan and Sharon rally together and get their parents back together before something awful happens? Watch this exciting movie starring the adorable Hayley Mills as Susan and Sharon, to find out!<br />Hayley Mills has got to be one of my favorite actresses, and this has got to be the best film ever. She is just so good!<br />The DVD is just filled with extras, and if you want to see another DVD with the same amount of extras, see 'Pollyanna', another one of Hayley Mills movies, which is also awesome.<br />A couple years ago Disney made a remake of the Parent Trap, and although the special effects are probably much better, you can't reproduce the same charm that Hayley Mills gave us when this movie first came out. The original is always the best!<br />Bottom line: See this movie, and I promise you, you won't regret it.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|As a musician, I am impressed by the quality of this soundtrack; but as a &quot;Ringer&quot; I am speechless.  I cannot begin to describe the myriad of emotion I experienced the first time I listened to this latest contribution from Howard Shore.  I heard this before I saw the movie.  After leaving the theater, all I wanted was to hear this album again.  Shore has once again brought to life the wonder of Middle-earth!!  The love; the adventure; the heartache, hope and triumph...all captured in 19 tracks.  I have seen the movie once so far, and yet all I have to do is pop in this CD, close my eyes, and I am there--not just in the theater, but in Middle-earth itself!  I am not an Annie Lennox fan, but her contribution to this album is incredible.  As a life-long James Galway fan, I was thrilled to see his name on this album.  Renee Fleming is wonderful, and Viggo Mortenson was quite a surprise.  Then there is Billy Boyd...I agree with others who have commented on the emotion of &quot;The Steward of Gondor.&quot;  I cried the first time I heard him sing.  I am nearly in tears as I am typing here.  There is so much emotion in just one little song.  So much power in such a small, quiet hobbit voice.  This album would be nothing without that song.<br />Overall, this is a real winner.  Howard Shore has saved the best for last!  I cannot even enjoy the book without this playing in the background.  Absolutely amazing!  There are not enough stars in the sky to rate this soundtrack!!! ;-)
B000002C1V|1.0|Why Roger why? Why did you try to destroy the Pink FLoyd name with this pile of garbage? This album is an atrocity to not only the Pink Floyd name but music. It hurts my feeling that something like this can be released. Its a slap to the face of Pink Floyd fans and I'm glad they released the Division Bell to bring back dignity to the name. Not Now John and Fletcher's Memorial Home are an insult to classics such as Dogs, Shine On You Crazy Diamonds, and Comfortably Numb.<br />Roger Waters... I'm glad you went solo cuz your stuff is pretty much garbage.
006092988X|5.0|I really loved this book. Honestly it WAS a bit hard to get through in certain parts but by the time you close this book you are so glad to have read it. A deeply moving piece and well worth the read. The ending even got me choked up. A must read for anyone!
080013558X|5.0|This movie shines like the top of the Chrysler building!<br />I absolutely loved this movie. Aileen Quinn is the perfect Annie, and no one could play the part as well as her. They say that she really has brown hair, but I can't imagine without that curly red mop of hers. To me she will always be Annie.<br />The reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of 2 reasons:<br />1. Miss Hanigan's drunk scenes. Aren't they, um, a bit inappropriate for kids?<br />2. The dances keep showing their underwear in the dances. They might have at least gave them petticoats or such, or been a bit more careful. You can do a 'kicking dance without showing your unmentionables. Oh well!<br />Other than that I just loved this video, and its super songs have gotten me singing them all day.<br />&quot;...No one cares for you a smidge, when you're in an orphanage, it's a hard knock life...&quot;
0790729628|5.0|first off...I haven't seen the original. However, Blade Runner is a great movie. more than being about what makes us human it transmits a feeling of intense urban alienation similar to Taxi Driver. everyone has left for the colony planets...and deckard has the thankless job of killing androids. the city bleeds noir- and the sets are so well done as to seem like a location shoot with the sheer density of information. the atmosphere is heavy with the minimal synth music. Ford underplays his role as usual, to good effect. Blatty, in search of immortality- or humanity- finds it by letting Deckard go- it is then we realize Deckard is less than human- the existential struggle plays out- and he's on the run towards a new life. The ending has great resonance, and Ford turns his head to the side...a display of relentless purpose.
6300182355|5.0|It's ia classic right up there with Star Wars.  The acting isn't all that great but, it deserves credit for great scenery and costumes.  It is definitely worth buying.

Add wonderful timeless music and arrangements and you have the most impressive album to come along in years and years.<BR>The album covers generations of favourites and Buble' takes each and every one as his own and some of the songs would challenge anyone with lessor natural talent. <BR>Come fly with me, That's all, and You'll never find another love like mine are taken to new heights and all the other songs showcase the incredible talent and vocal skills this man has.<br />This is a 'Can't Miss, Must Have, Highest Recommended' album.<BR>You'll never feel better about a music purchase and you'll get years of wonderful listening pleasure from it. Guaranteed!
B00008PC2O|4.0|Ok, I bought this DVD when it first came out for one reason only, the high definition version playable only on a PC (disk two).  I was extremely dissapointed when my fairly high end computer (at the time) was unable to provide anything resembling a smooth framerate.  It was awful.  At the time, my 2.0g P4 processor, 512mb rdram, and ATI 9800pro 128 were not gonna cut it.  I couldn't believe it.  Amazon was extremely kind to allow me to return it, even though it was against their policy (thanks Jeff).  According to some techies at InterActual, the HD DVD hits the main processor really hard.  The recommendations stated a 3.0g processor, which I was no where near.  I couldn't understand why they hadn't designed it to use more video card resources, after all, it's more likely that people have a high end 128mb video card than a 3.0g processor (especially a year ago!).  <BR>   Well a year has passed.  Since then, my computer has been upgraded to a 2.6 processor, plus I've added another gig of rdram for 1.5 total.  I didn't do these upgraded with this DVD in mind, but I figured I'd try it out again and see.  Lo and behold the HD version now plays at about 95 to 99% smoothness.  Bottom line: if you are concerned about whether or not your computer will run this pc-only high definition version- you should be!  But please use my experience to guide you.  You may or may not need a 3.0 processor, but you better be pretty close and have plenty of ram for the processor to fall back on.  <br />  What does the HD version actually look like?  It looks very good, but nowhere near as good as regualar high definition televsion that you can pick up for free over the airwaves.  Did you know that you can get HD for free with your existing antenna???  Now you do...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Don't expect a comedy! The only feeling that this film caused me was claustrophobia. One wanted to flee a screen where the characters are incapables to communicate between themselves; where the scenes (all of them we can easily do without) follow one another any old how. We see two hollows persons. Nothing else. There is not even friendship, rebelliousness or tenderness. That's why I didn't feel neither compassion nor interest. <BR>Sofia Coppola had budget but not a plot.
B00009W0WM|5.0|This is all time great classics movie that everyon should have in their collection
B00006F7S4|1.0|God.. this is soooo dull.. you can hardly tell the difference between any of the songs..<br />what happened to the creative and innovative genius of old.
B00006RINF|4.0|This is some polished, catchy goth-metal.  The vocal interplay between Cristina Scabbia and Andrea Ferro is good, and the strings flesh out the overall sound really well.  None of the songs get off course with overlong solos or spoken interludes.<br />All three Lacuna Coil releases have a similar sound.  Some nu-metal bones with goth strings/keyboards, and Scabbia's vocal beauty at the heart of it.  Her style is like that of The Gathering's Anneke Van Giersbergen, or Evanescence's Amy Lee (but I think Lacuna Coil was doing this stuff first.)  Every once in a while, the two singers betray their Italian origin with a &quot;d&quot; sound when singing &quot;th&quot;ere or &quot;th&quot;is.  No big deal.<br />The first five songs have a similar mood and tempo.  Then &quot;Aeon&quot; throws in a beautiful acoustic and vocal intro, before launching into &quot;Tightrope.&quot;  &quot;The Ghost Woman and The Hunter&quot; is one of my favorites, with a slower beat and more laidback music during the verses.  &quot;Entwined&quot; sounds the most like The Gathering of any song on the CD.  Granted, I like both bands.  The title track is a nice closer, sung in Italian, then English for the chorus.<br />&quot;Comalies&quot; doesn't try too hard to be metal or goth; it's a good blend of styles.  A *little* more variety in their sound will keep me a happy little consumer.
B00005JMFO|4.0|Building on the pattern of contemporary British comedies of manners -- starting with \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" and ending, hmmm..., wherever near Bridget Jones and \\"About a Boy\\", this mega-romantic mega-comedy encompasses almost a dozen of 'love stories', of which some are truly romantic, some just cute and some outright stupid. Each single character is distinguished clearly in their situation and so the viewer should not have problems with getting lost inside the mix, but it's the sheer star power that saves the movie. Emma Thompson is once again wonderful, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are everything you may expect from them, too. Laura Linney stars in one of the few episodes here that don't end much on the sunny side and youthfully luminous Keira Knightley is truly a sight for sore eyes not only for Mark (Andrew Lincoln) who thought he was gay. The cast also has some surprises in store, like singer Martine McCutcheon, and cameos by Billy Bob Thornton, Claudia Schiffer and ubiquitous 'Mr.Bean' Rowan Atkinson. Notable is the role of Bill Nighy (as the ageing rocker Billy Mack), who was awarded as best supporting actor by both British BAFTA academy and Los Angeles critics. The film at times tests viewers' sensitivity to profanity and suggestively sexual (although disguised as funny) scenes. This aside, it's intelligent and romantic entertainment, enhanced also by a stellar soundtrack (including songs from Norah Jones, Sugababes and Mariah Carey).
B0001US8EO|5.0|A lot of people forget that Wyatt Earp was a real man who had more courage and integrity then most people you will ever know.  I have read almost every book about Wyatt Earp and have visted the town of Tombstone 9 times in as many years. This movie is a pretty accurate portrayl of that man and to now have it finally come out on DVD is a long overdue achievement. Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid (Doc Holliday) do a superb job, although the supporting cast has a lot to be desired. This movie differs from the movie \\"Tombstone\\", in that it portrays a lot of Wyatt's life from being a teenager during the Civil War to his and Josie's adventure to the Alaskan gold fields near the turn of the century. \\"Tombstone\\" deals primarily with the happenings in Wyatt's life in that one town, which ironically dealt with less than 2 years of his long adventurous life. I liked this film because it dealt with an approximate 35 year time span of Wyatt's life, and the movie is long enough to dipict this. There are a lot of historical accuracies in the movie which include proper representations of people, places and dialogue such as what is said on the way to and during the gunfight. The inaccuracies are easily overlooked such as Virgil being shot in the wrong arm and the reference to \\"Johnny behind the Duece\\" as \\"Tommy.\\" All in all though, an excellent film about the life of a great man, Wyatt Earp.  This will be remembered as a classic.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Before you all start throwing balls of aluminum foil at me, I just  want to start off by honestly saying that I've been a BIG fan of Madonna for over a decade but this newest release, 2003's \\"American Life\\" is just a pile of garbage. To make it more clear, this is Madonna's worst album and it just makes you wonder what on Earth happened that resulted in this mess. The album art is just tacky! The lyrics are incredibly childish, negative, and absolutely depressing to listen to especially in this day in age where the media just feeds us nothing but negative stuff. I admire that she wasn't afraid to express left-wing or blatant criticism of current political problems but her chance of generating a controversial but incredible album is thrown right out the window on here. The music itself is nothing to write home about either. The lyrics are just absurd but even on a musical perspective, this album fails so badly that it makes you wonder if she was forced into the studio against her will. This album is that bad. Seriously, I cannot believe that this is the same woman who altered my world with the incredible masterpiece that was 1998's \\"Ray of Light\\". 2000's \\"Music\\" was a step down, being uneven but it was saved by some good songs. \\"American Life\\" to me is the opposite of her 1992 masterpiece \\"Erotica\\". While \\"Erotica\\" was controversial because of its deviant nature, the album ultimately turned out to be her greatest artistic achievement of the early 1990s. \\"American Life\\" goes down as her most controversial album as well as being the biggest mistake of her career, where as \\"Erotica\\" is a classic. The title track is the messiest, most disjointed excuse for a radio dance single that I've heard in years, being nothing more than an unlistenable hodgepodge of electronic noise, electronic sputtering sound effects for a beat, and atrocious vocals and the results are disastrous. I simply don't understand all the favorable reviews that this album receives. This album is just awful on a biblical scale. I can really identify with the critics on most subjects when it comes to this album.<br /> There is nothing good on this album. NOTHING!! Every song on this album is incredibly absurd to a nauseating degree. The only song that I feel shows any remote signs of enjoyability would be \\"Love Profusion\\" with it's danceable sound as it's the most melodic song on this entire album but even then, it's ability to entertain is totally sunk with weak hooks and annoying voice effects. This to me is the only song that I feel even remotely shines through the cesspool that is \\"American Life\\". The rest of this album is atrocious to listen to. Hearing Madonna actually attempting to rap is so bad that you will end up crushing your lungs when laughing at it. To put it plain and simple, this album is just an \\"American Lie\\". This album could really have been a huge and really awesome controversial adventure but whatever was going on, Madonna really wrecked her opportunity to create a really dynamite album. Just listening to this album will make you nostalgic in a sad sense and want to turn the clock back like five years to go back to the time when we were spooked with the euphoric bliss of \\"Ray of Light\\" when it was on the charts. Everything about this album is just plain tacky on all fronts. The only I haven't thrown this album away is because I got it as a gift from a friend and I don't throw gifts away.<br />The \\"Limited Edition\\" is also a joke, aimed at milking more money out of the poor fanbase who have been fiercely loyal for many years. The limited edition comes in a larger, leather cardboard box container with promo stickers and a large poster with artwork that is contained in the booklet of this album and to tell you the truth, this is one of the worst \\"Limited Edition\\" albums that I've ever seen. Whichever way you look at it, there is nothing worthy on this album at all. Not even a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" full of tons of bonus could rescue this album from beingthrown towards the junk pile. It's that bad! The enhanced stuff on the CD also interferes with album playing on the computer.<br />Although I may have shredded this album to molecules with this review, that doesn't mean that I'll stop being a Madonna fan this time because it's really in fact, amazing that she has gone for 20 years without putting out a bad album. I've enjoyed all of her previous albums to varying degrees and there are enough of them to keep me a fan of hers for a while and thus I'm not giving up on Madonna this time for its not unusual for even great artists to put out a bad or below average album or two in their career. Unfortunately, the 20 year streak is interrupted with this album. Hopefully, Madonna has or will have learned her lesson with this misstep and should her next album be released I'm guessing in 2006, it will be a major improvement over this disaster and put her back on her feet. I mean, what's there to lose anyway? I wouldn't say it's time to hang up the mike but it's time for a major overhaul in her music.<br /> Unitl then, all I can say is that \\"American Life\\" is the most disappointing release and one of the worst albums of 2003. I really, really tried to like this album, and even forced myself to like it by listening to it over and over again but I've given up and put \\"Ray of Light\\" back into my CD player. My advice is to just leave this album to collect dust on the shelves and invest in any of her other albums. Even thought I may not have been a fan of some of her images during certain eras in her career, I never thought that she would tumble down this low musically speaking. Avoid this album at all costs.g thrown towards the junk pile. It's that bad!

B00005RFVL|2.0|Robbie Williams fans will probably love this album.  But for Sinatra fans, it will only make you pine for the \\"real deal.\\"<br /><br />It is interesting to me that so much is made of the fact that this album was recorded at Capital records, in the same recording studios and using some of the same musicians as Sinatra's albums.  Why then, not just buy Sinatra's albums, instead of an imitator?<br /><br />Style is an indefinable commodity, but it was Sinatra's style (as well as Sammy's and Dean's) that made these songs work.  That, combined with their place in history at that time (they really defined that time in history for popular culture) and their relationship together that gave these songs a depth and dimension that no contemporary artist can copy.<br /><br />Williams makes the mistake of including Sinatra on one of the tracks, only making the differences between the Chairman and Williams more apparent.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that during the Rat Pack's days the recording technology could not match that used on the Robbie Williams album.  That truly is impressive.  After one listen, however, I tossed the Williams album out and put on my Rat Pack Live CD.  Now THAT'S swingin'.
B00005CCA9|5.0|The sensationally gifted pianist Martha Argerich, with two decades of classical music stardom (if there is such a thing) already behind her, took the Berlin audience by storm with this passionate recording of the very difficult Rachmaninov Third Concerto in 1982. Ever since, it's easy to see why -- her fiery personality and virtuoso pianism are flat-out sweeping and as the Amazon.com reviewer points out, physically exciting indeed. The orchestra under Riccardo Chailly needs a while to grow accustomed to Argerich's trail-blazing tempo, but once they do, it makes for all the better listening experience. Which does not mean to say she's incapable of playing slowly -- quite the opposite. A listener is more than willing to forgive her a couple of missed notes, especially in the first movement; rather, the climax of the closing Finale may just leave you breathless and forget anything else. The studio-recorded suite for two pianos is another treat and Argerich's fellow Argentinian Nelson Freire more than holds his own with her. (Although the more expensive CD with the same Third Concerto and Tchaikovsky's First is more preferred, the rare suite deserves having!) Simply put, this is a must for Rachmaninov fans, Argerich fans and probably classical music fans, too.

B00003CXDD|4.0|Ignore VIEWER FROM NJ folks.<br />Willow has all the components for a fantasy story: a fairly long journey, myth, legend, a band of varied heroes, a witch, a dragon, trolls, and brownies...action, adventure, humour, romance...<br />For the time when it was made, it is great; as time passes, all your favourite movies will seem slip backwards, from a technological point of view.  You appreciate a movie for what it is.<br />And while VIEWER FROM NJ mentions THe Phantom Mencace, which I must agree was tardy from every stand point, except the effects, he or she does not appreciate Willow.  It's not that the movie is bad as he/she states; they just can't appreciate it for what it is.<br />It is not on the same epic scale as Lord of the Rings in terms of the books and the movies (after all, Willow is 1 movie, not 3).  And unlike what VIEWER FROM NJ stated about &quot;You gotta have plot character and the mythic element of the hero for fantasy to work and to make great movies on the subject&quot;, Willow has it all then some (see first paragraph).<br />See this movie remembering whence it came.  VIEWER FROM NJ does appreciate that fact; also he/she seems to be young since they praised LOTR, saw The Phantom Menace then asked if there was &quot;CGI back then&quot;.  This seems to be the norm, for the younger folk not to appreciate and respect the movies from the previous years that has paved the way for the great (and unfortunately, not-so-great) movies of today and tomorrow. The dragon was actually done using a method called stop-motion animation; not CGI.  There was more worked involved in this method - actual (minitaure) models were used.<br />So ignoring VIEWER FROM NJ review, borrow Willow if you can; I'm pretty sure you'll want to own it afterwards.  Also have a look at Neverending Story (The first one), The Princess Bride, Legend, and Krull.
0380789035|5.0|Neil Gaiman's 'American Gods' is like 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' meets 'Lord of the Rings' meets 'On the Road'  meets 'A Complete Encyclopedia of Mythological Beasts and Gods.'  If this doesn't make any sense, read the book and you'll see what I mean.<br />This is Gaiman's most fully realized work since his 'Sandman' series.  It tells the story of Shadow, a prison inmate days away from his release who learns that his wife has died in a car crash.  On the dreary plane ride home, he meets a man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday who knows more about Shadow than he has any right to.  Wednesday informs Shadow that 'a storm is coming', and offers the man a job as a bodyguard.  A tight lipped muscleman with a basically gentle nature, Shadow soon finds himself thrown in with Wednesday and his 'friends', who turn out to be ancient gods struggling to find believers in America.  There's the suave African spider Anansi, the Egyptian cat goddess Bast, a genie who drives a cab in New York, and many more.  These gods, in danger of non existence due to the lack of belief in the American population, are preparing to fight a war against America's 'new' gods; the gods of technology, Internet, convenience, etc.  It's a battle for America's soul, and Shadow soon finds that he's got a more crucial role to play than he ever thought.<br />It's a lot to absorb, and Gaiman doesn't force it down our throats.  Instead of trying to keep the plot at a thriller's breakneck pace, the book's almost like a rafting trip.  Sometimes it's slow, but it still moves; sometimes there are pockets of treacherous rapids, but there's always time to enjoy the scenery.  In case I stretch this metaphor too far, just understand that this book is a rich experience looking to wrap you up in the colorful story about a man's journey through the world and within himself.  It's the type of book for a road trip.  It takes time, but it's worth every second.<br />Gaiman's got to be one of the most original, daring and surprisingly soulful storytellers today.  Shadow may remind you of the author's most famous character, Dream of the Endless (and our protagonist even looks like the Dream King), but Shadow is a slightly less tortured man, someone who's, to some extent, looking for his place in life again.  Maybe he finds it, maybe he doesn't.  I'm still not sure.  But while the book is dark, it's rich with mood, and there are moments of unexpected humor and emotion.  Laura, Shadow's wife, provides plenty of both.  (Yes, she is dead.  Yes, she has risen to follow her husband on his journey.  Yes, it's weird.  Just deal with it.)<br />The jerky, tight-lipped tone at the beginning of the novel will take some getting used to, but if you stick with it you'll soon move with the flow of the words, and then you'll be hooked.  The book can't have really flowing, elegant sentences, although Gaiman deftly sneaks some in there.  This is Shadow's story, more or less, and he doesn't talk much.  The only problem I can find is the ten pages of the denouement dedicated to the solving of an interesting but unnecessary mystery.  This would be a real problem if the novel was plotted to be a tight, terse read, but this IS a drifting, dream-like story.  It's not much of an annoyance.  And the last scene has to leave you smiling.  Maybe not the joyous mile-wide grin of a conventional happy ending, but you'll smile.  The conventional happy ending thing is overrated, anyway.<br />Buy this book, read it, love it, and understand just why Gaiman is a master writer.  Not just a master fantasy writer, a master writer.and surprisingly soulful storytellers today.  Shadow may remind you of the author's most famous character, Dream of the Endless (and our protagonist even looks like the Dream King), but Shadow is a slightly less tortured man, someone who's, to some extent, looking for his place in life again.  Maybe he finds it, maybe he doesn't.  I'm still not sure.  But while the book is dark, it's rich with mood, and there are moments of unexpected humor and emotion.  Laura, Shadow's wife, provides plenty of both.  (Yes, she is dead.  Yes, she has risen to follow her husband on his journey.  Yes, it's weird.  Just deal with it.)<br />The jerky, tight-lipped tone at the beginning of the novel will take some getting used to, but if you stick with it you'll soon move with the flow of the words, and then you'll be hooked.  The book can't have really flowing, elegant sentences, although Gaiman deftly sneaks some in there.  This is Shadow's story, more or less, and he doesn't talk much.  The only problem I can find is the ten pages of the denouement dedicated to the solving of an interesting but unnecessary mystery.  This would be a real problem if the novel was plotted to be a tight, terse read, but this IS a drifting, dream-like story.  It's not much of an annoyance.  And the last scene has to leave you smiling.  Maybe not the joyous mile-wide grin of a conventional happy ending, but you'll smile.  The conventional happy ending thing is overrated, anyway.<br />Buy this book, read it, love it, and understand just why Gaiman is a master writer.  Not just a master fantasy writer, a master writer.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|None of that 'You've got Mail' whimsical crap in this movie, thanks goodness! <br />Keaton's a bit too high strung, though I definitely hope to look as sexy (and lovable and cute) as her in my fifties! Boy can she cry!!! Nicholson somehow manages to find such a way with words that he transcends the script to another amazing level. What a talent! Frances McDormand was underused but the movie was long enough as it is and her big scene was stellar.<br />I'm 21 and I've watched this movie 4 times in the cinema. Not because I'm bored but because I felt that tug at my heartstrings everytime I watched the relationship develop between the two leads. It's delightfully complex, as it should be, and I could identify with the rawness of opening up to another person, so this flic isn't just for the baby boomers.<br />When was the last time I watched a movie 4 times? ...in another planet probabaly. When was the last time I watched a movie more than once? That was so long ago I can't remember the title of the movie.<br />It's not surprising that I still love listening to the soundtrack...though Jack N. crooning La Vie En Rose wasn't the best addition to a great compilation.<br />I don't know how Nancy Meyers can top this movie in her next effort, by boy do I sure hope she manages somehow. She has just raised the bar for romantic comedies...no more sitting through flaky movies of this genre, I'll just pop home to watch SGG on DVD, when it's released...in the meantime, the movie's still enjoying a wonderfully long screening here in Melbourne!

B0001ADAVK|3.0|As entertainment, \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" has its strong points. After all, it features some of some of today's best actresses - Julia Roberts, Kirsten Dunst, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Marcia Gay Harden. It has the look of the 1950s, which makes it a handsome period piece. The movie's central problems are its unsuccessful attempts to convey the real feeling of the period and its failure to create any truly memorable characters [the script's fault more than the performers']. While it wants to be seen as a historically accurate portrait of upper-middle class society fifty years ago, it winds being no more than an entertaining soap opera. [For a more astute vision of the period, watch the vastly superior \\"Far From Heaven\\" [2002]. For a searing portrait of a teacher in an all girls' school, check out 1969's \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\".] <br />Katherine Watson [Roberts], a recent UC Berkeley graduate, lands a job at Wellesley College, a prestigious East Coast women's college, as an art history teacher. She is impressed by her students' eagerness to learn, but appalled that, despite their academic excellence, their main ambition is to marry well. She begins a fairly benign campaign to get these women to realize that there might be other ambitions in life worth pursing. Her efforts make the college's president and its board of trustees uncomfortable to the point that her job is in danger. The students' responses range from acceptance to outright hostility. <br />The always delightful Roberts is miscast here. She is a joy to watch and gives one of her most mature performances, yet she comes off as an early 21st Century woman sent to the mid-20th Century to show these girls what the future will be like. This interpretation gives her character a certain smugness. <br />The supporting cast is uniformly excellent. Gyllenhaal nearly steals the movies as Giselle, a beautiful Jewish student, the only one who seems destined to be on the forefront of women's lib in years to come.
0385504209|5.0|It amazes me to see another writer get torn to pieces when mentioning a religion...even in fiction???  The negative reviews of this book stand as a testament to the fact that if you mention anyones religion in what they happen to perceive as a negative light...you will blind them to what you are truly saying...if anything...after all this is a fiction novel.  Which by the way i could not put down...you had me sucked in at the mention of a female goddess???  sounds good to me!!  To all the others out there that are too educated to enjoy a good read...i really feel bad for you...you don't know what you are missing...no need to tear this book to shreds because it mentions the catholic church, some art history and a conspiracy...has this world become so serious that no one can read a good fiction novel for pure fantasy and enjoyment anymore??  Though...i will check into the female Goddess thing...sounds good to me!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden. No introduction required. This band single-handedly changed the face of metal. Judas who? No, this is the band that helped pioneer thrash, spearheaded the NWOBHM, and even today inspires an entire European school of death and black metallers and a few American hardcore stragglers.<br />It's albums like Dance of Death that remind everyone who's boss. A swift kick to the proverbial groin of the music world to spin it on its ear. And on that level, it surely delivers. 68 minutes of pure Maiden, in various incarnations of the band's amazing album career.<br />Now for bad news. &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; was the bar-band kickoff track, and although it's nice to see Maiden getting back to songs under 5 minutes, the song is forgettable, with a weak chorus and lead line. And that's the beginning. Dance of Death is marred by rehashed and boring songwriting. Steve Harris seems to be omnipresent throughout the album, and includes at least 4-5 bass intros. FOUR INTROS?! Not to mention almost all of them are ripped straight from Brave New World. Riffs and themes reappear as well. I recognized pieces of &quot;Mother Russia,&quot; &quot;Fallen Angel,&quot; &quot;The Clansman,&quot; &quot;Number of the Beast,&quot; and other older Maiden songs. The title track evades this, but fails due to being too long, containing cheeeeesy lyrics, and ripping a melody from the &quot;Chicken Dance.&quot; &quot;Journeyman&quot; is &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; Pt. 2, and to top it all off, Kevin Shirley's muddy production puts the kabosh on this album.<br />There are good sides. &quot;Rainmaker&quot; manages to use the classic Maiden 3-chord progression in a new way, and a wonderfully succinct, catchy song is created. &quot;No More Lies,&quot; although not without its rehash, repetition, and length, is still a great heavy track. &quot;Gates of Tomorrow&quot; is an okay filler, &quot;New Frontier&quot; is a showcase of Nicko McBrain's first band contribution, and &quot;Paschendale&quot; isan intense(although overlong) war epic. And not enough praise can be laid upon &quot;Age of Innocence,&quot; where a groovy chorus and unusual key signature(not E minor!) create a new song style for Maiden. Bruce Dickinson strays away from the high notes and shows off his amazing baritone skills, Janick Gers proves he's not all shred, and the other guitar team of Murray/Smith are amazing as usual.<br />All in all, Dance of Death is a regression from Brave New World. Iron Maiden has attempted to recapture some older elements of their music, but the reinsertion of twin harmonies and excess bass intros was a step back. BNW experimented with new textures, and had a much more modern feel to it. DOD gets lost in the chunky production, confuses itself with three guitarists, and gets old due to the resurfacing of older elements. A few key shining moments prove, however, that Iron Maiden can't be bought, can't be sought, and will STILL get you...wherever you are.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|I had been looking forward to WM XX since the announcement was made that it would be held at MSG again. The show had a special feel because of all of the history involved and because it was WM XX. However, I belive WWE really dropped the ball overall and the show could have been so much better.<br />The Cena/Show match was a good way to kick things off but it was a bit slow, and people who were looking for more of a pure wrestling match didn't get what they wanted here for sure! Cena winning his first belt did get people excited. The Y2J vs. Christian match had some nice wrestling and was a decent match with a suprise turn that I won't spoil at the end!<br />I think both of the four-way tag matches were a waste of time. WWE needs to seiously consider where it wants to go with the tag team divisions in the future. If they are going to just keep throwing teams together and putting them into these types of matches just to get them on the card, they might as well not waste the time with a tag team division. This made me wish the Hart Foundation, the Rockers, Strike Force, or Demolition were still competing and both of the British Bulldogs were alive and healthy. Pick any two of those teams and make the match and it would be better than any of these silly four-way tag matches that we have endured for the last 3 or 4 'Manias. <br />It is too bad Hulk Hogan decided that was not worth a one-night return to WWE to team with the Rock and Foley. I would have been more interested in Hulk/Rock/Foley vs. Evolution. Seeing the Rock and the Nature Boy in the same ring was still cool. Rock was entertaining (his strut right before dropping the People's Elbow on Flair was hillarious) and the match is almost worth watching for that if nothing else.<br />Eddie Gurrero and Chris Benoit both put forth great efforts and it is good to see WWE rewarding them for all their hard work. The matches that they participated in were probably the two best of the night. Angle, HHH, and HBK also made these matches almost worth the price of the PPV. These guys give it their all every time out, and these are probably the best guys to build the card around at this point.<br />I wish Bret Hart was healthy enough to have accepted Angle's challenge. That match would have needed no hype or buildup. All you would have had to say would be WM XX - Angle vs. Hitman, and you could sell out the Silverdome again. <br />Brock vs. Goldberg could have almost been that type of match. This is my biggest dissapointment of the show. Both men are so much better than this and considering it was WM XX and they were performing at MSG in a featured match you would have thought they would have at least ACTED like they were interested. For heaven sake, this was the night of a lifetime for both men and they tanked it. It must have killed Stone Cold to just stand in the middle of the ring and listen to the crowd shout \\"boring.\\" For their effort, both Brock and Goldberg deserved even far worse than the \\"Stunners\\" they each got at the end. Stone Cold probably wanted to do far worse to them for real! Brock's WM XIX match with Angle was FAR better and better shows what Brock is capable of, but of course Angle could have a good match with the little scarecrow out in your corn field.<br />I personally liked the Undertaker angle and the new getup and will be interestd in seeing where that goes. The looks on Kane's face when 'Taker appeared on the runway were pretty good! <br />So that is my take on it. I will buy the DVD becasue it is WM XX and may rate the entire DVD at that time.
B00018TI5E|5.0|John Frusciante has a very rare talent for song writing that has only just started to show its full range. His previous albums although excellent mearly show his potential. Shadows Collide with people is a true modern masterpiece from the first note of Carvel to the last one of The Slaughter with not one note straying. All songs on this album are truly exceptional i love it.
0679411585|2.0|Well I have to say this book definately was an accurate account<BR>of what occured in Vietnam. The brutality and anguish the soldiers went through was accurately told but was dry as the Sahara desert. For a true war lover, or for somebody who wants an accurate account of war in Vietnam from people who were there it's good, otherwise I suggest the movie or a book that doesn't drag on.
B00009W8N2|5.0|I'll keep this short.<br />If you are one of the many Opeth fans who fell in love with Blackwater Park or Damnation and are looking to get into earlier Opeth, steer clear of this release. This album is a mixture of doom metal, folk passages, classical technique, and cold production. Akerfeldt's growls are terribly raspy and high-pitched, the singing is almost nonexistent, out of tune and soft, and the lyrics are overly ambiguous. The music seems to start and stop, with random passages being glued together to form songs with no real rhyme or reason behind them. A different bassist and drummer were present here as well, so breathy, open bass lines and midtempo, triggered double bass drums appear instead of the subdued natural styles of current players Mendez and Lopez. You have been warned.<br />However, this album also contains many gorgeous passages in a style that would only return for the next two albums. A certain poignancy is present is was traded in for depression and art-rock. Under A Weeping Moon? The Apostle In Triumph? Wow. That's some evocative imagery there. And the occasional Opethian Gothenburg riff does appear, such as in the first few minutes of &quot;Forest Of October&quot; or &quot;The Twilight Is My Robe.&quot;<br />Also included is a 3-minute piano instrumental performed by the band's drummer, and a short acoustic piece. Little known fact: Part of &quot;Requiem&quot; is actually present on the seventh track as an intro to &quot;The Apostle In Triumph&quot; due to a tracksetting mess-up.<br />Orchid is Opeth in the beginning, before the recognition, before the masterpieces that were to come. And it's still amazing.<br />Recommended for experienced Opeth fans, and those that like My Dying Bride, Extol, Agalloch, and early Ulver.<br />Note: This rerelease contains a bonus track: &quot;Into The Frost of Winter.&quot; Ummm...wow. Aside from a few &quot;Advent&quot; riffs, this track is a total waste of audio space and kills the final moments of the album with ear-splitting, badly-produced, utter noise. Enjoy!
B00008OLYN|1.0|this is absolutely the worst cd ive ever heard.  it is terrible!!! dont ever buy this cd. the music is bland and boring i cant even stand to listen to it for 3 minutes.  i dont know what possesed me to buy this i had never heard of them or wat type of music they played or any song of theirs.  i mean i like all types of music and this is by far the worst cd ive heard. save ur money and time and go buy a TOOL cd.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|There is no soundtrack. There is no plot. There is no point. Although some would argue that a lack in soundtrack is unimportant, I strongly disagree. A soundtrack adds so much to the moment. This movie lacks this. This creates strange silence as the main characters whisper to eachother. This is not the only reason I dislike this film. It is random. There is no flow from one scene to the next. In one scene the main characters are in a bar, the next they are in a strip club, next you'll see them fleeing a gun fight from another bar, then you see Bill Murray golfing. There is no plot as far as I can see. It is about two &quot;alone&quot; people in Japan who have nothing to do but be depressed, so they find eachother and go to different places. It is very strange and very boring. Some argue that it is &quot;artistic&quot; I say that it is just bland and dull. If Lord of the Rings is DaVinci, Lost In Translation is fingerpaint. It's almsot worth seeing this movie so that all the other movies you've seen look better!
B000002J2F|5.0|With 1978's ...AND THEN THERE WERE THREE, Genesis proved that becoming a trio & more of a pop band wasn't something they were unable to do. Rather, they did it & were fantastic at it! Not much of the band's progressive sound had been diluted, it was just being employed on shorter songs that were more likely to get on the radio. After a two-year break, Genesis came roaring back into the marketplace with 1980's DUKE.<br />When \\"Follow You Follow Me\\" became Genesis' first American top 30 hit, that had to have convinced the trio that people were listening to them & waiting for more from Genesis. DUKE certainly didn't disappoint with 2 major hit singles & a million-selling album that also happened to be one of the finest in Genesis' catalog.<br />Keyboardist Tony Banks & guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford had long been acquainted with writing their own songs, but drummer/vocalist Phil Collins hadn't had enough practice yet & before DUKE, was more comfortable writing songs as part of a unit. But with his first marriage on the rocks, Phil must have found some therapy in writing his own music, enough to even lay the groundwork for his first solo album around the time of DUKE's recording. Before that, Phil gave two solo compositions to the band: the insanely catchy \\"Misunderstanding\\" (Genesis' first excursion into the top 20) & the heartbreaking ballad \\"Please Don't Ask\\". While the former may not be directly related to Phil's marital troubles, the latter's relevance is more than palpable, with a sense of \\"let's try & work this out\\" sentiment to it. The much deeper look into Phil's psyche of 1981's FACE VALUE is first evident on \\"Please Don't Ask\\".<br />Even on the songs Phil sang, but didn't write, there's a sense that he was using his own personal upheaval as a source of inspiration for his singing. Mike Rutherford's \\"Alone Tonight\\" is clearly coming from a man who needs someone to love, but has become too accustomed to being alone to really know when it's there (sort of autobiographical here). Tony Banks' brief \\"Guide Vocal\\" takes a different side, perhaps indicating Phil is bitterly saying farewell to his estranged wife & maybe the grass is greener on the other side. Talk about your mixed emotions!<br />But DUKE is not just simply a dry run for Phil's aural therapy session on FACE VALUE. This is still a Genesis album, and it's an excellent showcase for the band's always-tight musicianship. DUKE opens with a bang on the group-penned \\"Behind The Lines\\". Perhaps similar to the \\"day in the life of a rock star\\" opener of ...ATTWT (\\"Down & Out\\"), Phil would later re-record this song for FACE VALUE, giving it a decidely different arrangement. \\"Turn It On Again\\" was the album's other hit single (despite charting in the lower half of the Hot 100), and has long been a fan favorite, even lending its name to the band's greatest hits album. Again, catchy as hell, all doubts about Genesis not being able to rock are silenced once one hears this song.<br />The less personal numbers on DUKE are equally strong. The band-written \\"Duchess\\" was written about a year before Princess Diana, but its story of a much-loved & tragic public figure (for this song, a singer) is eerily prophetic. It still stands as a near-spot-on commentary about the price of fame. Mike's \\"Man Of Our Times\\" is a slow-moving, dirge-like number that could be about a politician, a king or any famous man of some sort. Good groove to it, though. Tony's \\"Heathaze\\" has an ethereal, windswept quality that would not have been out of place on 1977's WIND & WUTHERING. The meaning to Tony's \\"Cul-De-Sac\\" is hard to discern, but it's still a fine performance all the same. As with any of Tony's compositions, the keyboards are front & center in the mix, carrying the song fabulously.<br />To show that they hadn't completely turned their back on the progressive days, DUKE began the tradition of featuring at least one song that can rank as tried-and-true progressive rock. For this album, it was the closing two tracks of \\"Duke's Travels\\" & \\"Duke's End\\". The first part opens with a shimmering wall of synthesized keyboards that literally wraps the listener in sound before Phil's long-underrated prowess as a drummer comes in, leading the band on an epic, layered instrumental work that shows off the benefits of DUKE having been recorded at ABBA's Polar Studios in Sweden. It was one of the first all-digital studios ever built. Although listed as an instrumental \\"Duke's Travels\\" does have lyrics (a reprise of \\"Guide Vocal\\"). The second part closes out the album with a much more syncopated version of the first part, bringing DUKE to a smashing end.<br />With their commercial standing increasing as time went on, Genesis more than proved they were not just another band commercializing their music to get on the radio & sell more records. At the same time, Genesis were improving as a band, exploring unchartered (for them, at least) musical waters. Even nearly 25 years after its release, DUKE still ranks as one of Genesis' finest albums, especially at a then-lengthy 55 minutes. With Genesis on their way to becoming pop music royalty, DUKE was more than an appropriate moniker.losing two tracks of \\"Duke's Travels\\" & \\"Duke's End\\".

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This movie has it all! It has humor, fantasy, and an overall outstanding story! Ewan McGregor plays a fabulous Edward Bloom, an eccentric young man on a journey to find a \\"bigger pond.\\" Tim Burton delivers a wonderful and touching story in this film about a dying man with a son who won't accept him as he is. The movie takes you on the twists and turns through Edward Bloom's life as his son tries to discover who his father is. Although mildly disappointing for some Burton fans, as it is not as weird as some of his other movies, you will not be dissapointed with this movie. The cast is great and the story is phenomenal creating an exceptional film!

B00005RYKV|5.0|To describe &quot;Brother&quot; as Takeshi Kitano's American directorial debut is like saying Lost in Translation is a Japanese movie.  The speaker would be missing the boat totally.  In &quot;Brother&quot; we see Japan and America coming to a cataclysmic impact as Yamamoto (Kitano), a Yakuza mobster, is exiled from Japan and forced to live in America with his half-brother.  When Kitano finds out that his brother is a small time drug dealer, Kitano takes his brother (as well as his gang) under his wing and turns them into a crime organization to be reckoned with.  They take on a mexican cartel and italian mafia alike.  However, we see the theme of brotherhood become more of a theme when he and Denny (played by Omar Epps), another small time drug dealer, create a bond that was never attained by his blood brother.<br />Kitano uses light and shadow to punctuate the drama, but the most awe inspiring element to his cinematic vision is the use of silence and stillness.  When Kitano is on the screen, sometimes he stands like a statue.  The silence in his films are deafening (for a remarkable example of this, I refer to the film &quot;Violent Cop&quot;).<br />With the use of Japanese and English language, we are thrust among the cultural barrier of the gang.  However, they are able to circumvent this and become true brothers.
B00000055E|5.0|These are 26 cut recordings from Tupac's earlier days taken from the years of 91' through to 94'. A long listen, but at the end you end up realising what a great loss of talent the world of hip hop suffered when the thug rapper was tragically gunned down back in 1996.<br />Although these are songs that didn't make it to his earlier albums, this did not doubt my opinions of their quality - it was good material, although not consistent enough. This is more of a black and white album with no shades of gray, the good songs are great, the bad songs are terrible. 'R U Still Down?' does have its hot spots with tracks such as the unforgettable 'Do For Love', the religious 'I Wonder If Heaven Gotta Ghetto' and the haunting and very mysterious 'Only Fear Of Death'. Lyrically, at this stage of his life especially, Tupac's views are more political and intellectual for the majority of the album since he had not quite reached his Death Row days just yet.<br />The two disc set, in a way, tells a story of a man who was on the verge of something here, yet never got the time to fulfil it as you can tell some verses are incomplete and hesitant. Do not think this lessens the albums quality, as about 80% of it is worth while. Although one of my favourite Tupac albums, 'R U Still Down?' in short is a sad and depressing story of a man who knew his end was to come far too soon.
B0001CCXY8|4.0|First of all, I respect everyones comments on here.. Death Metal is a extreme form of music and not for everyone. I'm a vocalist for a death metal band myself and as one, I would probably be put off by everyone liking this kind of music.. On the other hand though.... Nightloaf why dont you leave the death metal reviews for people who actually ENJOY this music... I found your comments ignorant and everyone who reads them is probably enjoying a good laugh at your expense. Cannibal Corpse helped define the genre along with such great bands as Death, Morbid Angel and Obituary. They deserve respect after 15 years of churning out some great music and making minimal money. True the lyrics aren't highbrow.. but there meant to be taken in the same manner you would a horror movie..not seriously. Although I would enjoy Cannibal to go in a different direction lyrically from time to time... the band is great and there music still keeps me interested...<br />Skull Full of Maggots..(not Beethoven, but feel good music all the same)...<br />Laqudis
B0000C8AQM|4.0|Could anybody tell me what's the title of the song that Jack Black plays just after Smoke on the water?, while he keeps jumping from one leg to the other one, is it in this CD? <BR>Many thanks
0142004235|5.0|These book is one of the greatest clasics you can come across. It is a serene insight in relationship on man-women and brotherhood issues. Though is not very crystal on answering the question why the main character is so sentimentaly naive and as such against all odds, but still the situation, the consequences of it are colorfuly depicted. It's a book how Good can survive against the Evil but still it gets the shorter end of it. There is no ideal or divine realization that good will win overall. Being truly and naivly good doesn't mean that you will be awerded for it and that a true love can win at the end. It can be farse to itself.
B0000C8AQM|4.0|Could anybody tell me what's the title and the author of the song that Jack Black plays just after Smoke on the water? while he keeps jumping from one leg to the other. <BR>Is it in this CD?<BR>Many thanks
B00009MEJU|3.0|I'm probably generous in giving this movie three stars. What a disappointment. The movie can be summed up in one word, dull.&quot; There is a lot of talk here and not much else-- I love a good talk movie of the calibre of, say, LION IN WINTER--but that is not what we have here. You'll be lucky if you can stay awake in this one.<br />Biggest surprise of the movie: That Steven Soderbergh of ERIN BROCKOVICH and other fine movies directed this dog.<br />Best lines from the movie: At one point  Natascha McElhone says &quot;I don't understand&quot; three times in fairly rapid succession. I couldn't agree more.<br />Best thing about the movie: It's no longer than it is.
B000089RVX|5.0|I can't seem to listen to this cd enough.  It is perfect for listening to while working out or doing anything around the house.  I think this cd will be a timeless classic rock cd.  The songs have an excellent combination of lyrics, sung beautifully, and rock music.  I think as a whole this is one of the best cd's I have listened to in a while.  I hope they can match it in the future.
0780020685|5.0|This is an incredible movie. I loved it.  Not only does the Seven Samurai have loads of action, but there are other aspects of this movie that make it such an enjoyable experience to watch.  The thing I like best about this movie was the humor. Some of the lines said by the samurais were so hilarious I couldn't stop laughing!  Even though things got silly at times, there was ,however, a very serious side to the movie and it made you realize how tough life can really be. I have watched several of Akira Kurosawa's films such as Ran, etc, and by far, this is his best work. The only complaints I have about this movie was that it was in black and white and so I had a hard time reading the white lettering of the subtitles. This movie is a true gem.  I was thinking of buying it, but my oh my, it is quite costly! Nevertheless, it is worthy to put in anyone's collection. It is rare that you'll ever find a movie as good as this, it is in a league of it's own.  Truly a masterpiece that should be cherished!
0451169514|5.0|Something is killing the children in Dairy, Maine. To librarian Mike Hanlon this is nothing new. When he was a kid , he belonged to a group of kids called the &quot;Loser's Club&quot; who managed to come together to fight against the evil of Derry known only as &quot;IT&quot;. All of them made a promise that if &quot;IT&quot; ever returned, that they would come back and finish the fight. The only problem is that Mike is the only one that remained in Dairy and remembers anything that happened. The rest of the &quot;Loser's Club&quot; has been gone from Dairy for quite some time. Bill is a succesful writer. Richie is a popular stand up comic and radio disc jockey. Ben is no longer overweight and is the most sought after architect in the country. Beverly runs her own fashion design company. Eddie owns a successful limo company that drives all the stars. Stan is a highly sucessful accountant. Now Mike must remind them all of the promise they once made. The former friends must leave their succesful lives behind, and come back to Dairy to put a stop to &quot;IT&quot;, once and for all. <br />&quot;IT&quot; is not only one of King's best books, but it is also one of the best books that I have ever read. The unending amout of horror and suspense is incredible. The story itself is briliantly written and goes back and forth between when the characters were all kids, and the present time when they fight &quot;IT&quot; as adults. The parts of the story when they are kids, are my favorite because it shows that true friendship can overcome even the biggest of odds. The parts of the story where they come together as adults are good as well. The strangers that they are now, must become the friends they once were. The monster itself refered to as &quot;IT&quot; is the best part of the book. &quot;IT&quot; is a creature that changes into the worst fear of the child. The characters are all spectacular. All of the members of the &quot; Loser's Club&quot; posses different strengths andaspects of their personalities that you will like. Aside from &quot; IT&quot;, the bully Henry Bowers is the other villan. He is a great character. When the kids aren't fighting &quot;IT&quot;, they are fighting Henry and his gang. Even though Henry is only 12, he acts like a grown psychopath. Sometimes Henry can be even more terrifying than &quot; IT&quot; itself! The book also takes a controversial look at racism in the 1950's too. <br />The one word of advice that I can give with this book, is don't let the length of it scare you. Even though it is almost 1100 pages, it reads at an increadibly fast rate. The story is so good that you want there to be more after it's over! The wonderful friendship between the characters, the suspense and terror, and the well written story make &quot;IT&quot; a truly memorable classic from the master of horror.
0451169514|5.0|It's been said before and will be said again that the best element of King's novels is his characters, and as a reader of many of his novels, I feel that &quot;It&quot; displays his finest characterizations. I was thirteen when I first read this book, and could hardly put it down. It does deal with some adult topics, so parental disgresion might be advisable for young teens, but hopefully all highschool juniors should be able to handle the subject matter. I didn't find it to be scary, but even 'The Exorcist' hasn't managed that, so I don't know if I'm a good spokesperson on that account.<br />There are seven self-proclaimed eleven-year-old 'Losers' who form a tight bond as the children small town in Maine they live in are slowly being brutally killed off by their deepest fears. The thing that causes all the fears can only be fought off by the belief in things that protect them. Only through belief that a fear can hurt you, can It hurt you; only through belief that something has strength can you save yourself (a pleceba, for example), if that makes sense.<br />The element of this novel that made me fall in love with it was the bond that the seven friends shared when they were eleven and that they had to forget it to go on with their lives. Imagine, forgetting the thing that made your childhood what it was, the best friends that you ever had - better friends that many people ever have - and the greatest thing that you ever did. The summer that these seven spent together, battling It, a summer when they weren't still children, but weren't quite adults, was possibly the best thing about this novel, and the fact that it ended, as did the weekend the grown-up version of the kids spent 27 years later. Saying goodbye to characters I've come to love is the hardest part of anything I read, and it's difficult to ever imagine saying goodbye to such good friends as the characters were not knowing it is the last time you will ever see them, much less think of them or the most important element of their childhood.<br />Appologies for this review not being as concise as it could have been or making as much sense as it could have.
B00006BTCA|3.0|The correct comparisons for their best songs is with Kitchens of Distiction and the Wedding Present.  I like about half the songs on the album alot.  The other half are just ok.
B00013F38K|3.0|I own the tape version of the pilot movie, so I did a frame by frame comparison (first frame when scenes change was how I marked frames)<br />Unquestionably, they choped the top and bottom (indiscriminately too), and NOTHING extra on the sides.<br />4 stars for the series: Despite the fact that the fighting looked like it was choreographed by 3rd graders.  The wisdom, while clear, was subtle (unlike the 2nd series, where it was done to impress - look at me, I'm saying something you don't understand), the flashbacks were well intergrated, and the stories were just plain great.<br />2 stars for the DVD:  OK, the color was much improved upon over the tape.  Unfortuanately it goes downhill fast from there.  Artifacts and scratches were not removed.  And, after a frame by frame comparison (see above details), it was clearly choped.  What's worse, is that there was no effort made to scan up or down when needed.<br />There are many times when they could have made the cut completely off the bottom, without affecting the scene at all.  Yet instead, they decided to just cut off the same distance from top and bottom, and cut off a piece of someone's head!?<br />All that said, the series was good enough, and the price cheap enough, that I'll probably buy the next two seasons when they come out.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Though the 2-disc collections entitled \\"1962-1966\\" (The Red Album) and \\"1967-1970\\" (The Blue Album) are better overviews of the fab four, this 27-track, single disc compilation sums up pretty much everything they recorded from 1962-1970. This is a number ones collection, so it won't have fan favorites like \\"Please, Please Me\\" or \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\". Their is absolutely nothing from the legendary, \\"The White Album\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". That's pretty disappointing, but this collection pathed the way for other number ones collections like Elvis' 30 #1 Hits or Michael Jackson's Number Ones. \\"1\\" is great, though, because it really has all of the group's major hits. The remastering is a great improvement over all of the other Beatles remasters, thanks to George Martin. I really do recommend this collection to Beatles newbies and hardcores alike. This is a monumental collection of the greatest pop band ever. I think a good addition to this would be \\"The White Album\\" because that album has genius all over it. Before you buy any of their albums, this would be a great starter. From their first hit, \\"Love Me Do\\" to their farewell, \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", all of them are classics.
B0001ENY6M|2.0|i've always deeply stroken by this simple fact : a music written for any movie is a descriptive music, and this is why it is NOT pure music at all...it is something else, it appears as a kind of commentary for the pictures of the movie itself, something often unnecessary and that can be replaced easily...In this score, John Debney appears as a good music movies composer, undoubtedly but his music - as for Shore in the Lord of the ring, for example - is completely prisoner from the pictures, and, without these pictures, the score becomes awfully weak...<BR>I'll always remind me the discussion i had with composer Jan Leontsky, going out from a parisian cinema where we had seen &quot;Raging bull&quot; from Scorsese (with this so well-chosen theme from Mascagni's opera Cavalleria Rusticana)...

6300214435|2.0|Well well well. If it isn't the most contriversal Jones film of the trilogy. I have to say, this film was a bit too much. To this day I'm surprised this movie didn't get an &quot;R&quot; rating. Although this film is the reason why there is a PG-13. The biggest flaw with this movie is that it doesn't give us a chance to breathe. It could have been a lot better if only it weren't so violoent and dark. Spielburg said himself that this was his least favorite of the Raiders films. Lucas also agreed that it was a bit too dark for it's own good. They wanted to make a different movie from Raiders of the Lost Ark and I guess this was just a little too different. Not the worst move ever made, but the least of the series.

B00005ONMJ|5.0|This DVD brings to life 1954 Salzburg festival production of Don Giovanni. The very first shot of the camera is on Furtwangler, when he steps up t0 the conductor's plate and gives the gesture to the orchestera. And then sounds two terrifying cords signaling the beginning of the amazing performace.<br />The first thing that comes to your mind is how precise is Furtwangler with all the tempos. It is one of the most pedantic conducting you will ever hear. But this is how one should interpret Mozart. His music is so brilliant, it seems so simple, but in order to achieve this beauty and simplicity you have to be very organized when performing it. On this DVD this organization starts with Furtwangler and the amazing Salzburg orchestra and spreads to all the performers. I don't know with whom to start: Cesare Siepi is magnificant. His voice is so rich, so beautiful. He is probably the best Don Giovanni of 20th century. Also I want to mention Anton Dermota's Don Ottavio. Dermota is the best Don Ottavio you will ever hear. My favourite moment from this DVD is Donna Anna - Don Ottavio duet in the first scene. It makes you cry. Leporello, Commendatore, Donna Elvira, Mazetto, Zerlina - all are brilliant. Sound and video quality is surprisingly very  good.<br />This DVD is a masterpiece, especially for Mozart lovers. This is must have. Get it!!!
0671042858|1.0|(I apologize in advance for my baseball puns)<br />What happened to the psychological thrillers of the 70's, or even the cheap dime-store paperback slash-gore novels King has produced in the past? The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is basically driven by the general American standard: a young girl lost in the woods who loves baseball cannot die. So right off the bat, you know that anything that happens in the novel has to be about her struggle, meaning the meat instead of the bread of the book has to surpass. Unfortunately neither really step up to the plate. The finale, the grand unveiling of our monster du jour is so anti-climactic, disappointing and dull that it leaves one wondering: is King even trying anymore? If you want to wash out the bad taste Gordon has left in your mouth, pick up &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, by far a superior novel.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Once upon a time, the super-hero Daredevil battled for his life against bad-guys like The Owl, The Purple Man, Stilt Man, The Leap Frog, and The Mysterious Masked Matador. Matt Murdock's twin brother Mike popped up out of the blue too. Those were the days! In case you are wondering, The Mysterious Masked Matador was a guy dressed like a matador who used a big piece of cloth to avoid the horn masked D.D. like a matador fighting a bull! LOL! There were stories like \\"Enter: The Leap Frog\\", \\"Behold The Beetle\\", and my personal favorite title \\"...And Men Shall Call Him OX!\\". None of this was realistic, but I loved it. The same can be said of the Daredevil movie. It's Daredevil and it's escapism.<BR> <BR>Some of the CGI in the movie is awful, but for the most part I loved the look of the film.  Those who can only watch movies with \\"perfect\\" effects should stay clear of this and many other great films. I love comic book movies like Superman The Movie, and The Crow, but by today's standards the effects in those aren't up to par either. Having said that, I think the very first CGI shot in Daredevil is classic. The other less effective CGI moments are cartoony, but the action in classic Daredevil comics was unreal. The playground fight scene in the movie is as absurd as Daredevil's battle with the Mysterious Masked Matador. LOL!<br />After too many newer Daredevil comics where Matt Murdock has a constant furrowed brow to represent angst, I enjoyed Affleck as a Matt who has a lighter side to him. There are silly moments, but I don't mind one bit. Some view comics as holy writ, but this isn't The Passion Of The Christ. Daredevil has dramatic moments, but isn't meant to be taken too seriously. It may or may not please all comic die-hards, but it is an enjoyable picture with a good cast, humor, romance, fun, and some cool dark moments. Daredevil is a popcorn worthy good time.

B00013F38K|5.0|I got my DVD today and I've watched the first episode, plus the two very interesting documentaries on the first DVD. The other two DVD's do not have added bonus material. The actual DVD's are constructed rather tame, with no frills; I don't think elaborate motion menus would have been appropriate - somehow the zen like minimalist approach seems to do Kung Fu justice.<br />Now the important part - the image quality! The episodes look like they were shot on film yesterday. It has true 16:9 ratio, so we are seeing more than when it first aired. At least it seems this way to me. Includes subtitles in English, French and Spanish. Having the entire first season of a kung fu vegetarian hero is the treasure of my collection.
B0000C1733|5.0|I didn't even like The Red Hot Chilli Peppers,but I couldn't resist buying this cd after I heard Fortune Faded on the radio.I realized that they are a really great band,and I have (since buying this cd)purchased several other Peppers cd's like By The Way,One Hot Minute,and BloodSugarSexMagik, and several of John Frusciante's solo albums, now they are one of my favorite bands.Everyone should own a copy of this cd!!!!
0195073401|5.0|The book presents a very complete treatment in theoretical microeconomics. It is rigorous but plenty of explanations and examples.<br />Some readers complain about the lack of real world examples and the math level. Well, the book is intended for graduate students in economics and requires full command of calculus in several variables, nonlinear optimisation (Kuhn-Tucker), and some concepts in real analysis. Without, this background I understand it may be painful to read it. One advice is reviewing the mathematical appendix and using a complementary text like Simon&amp;Blume. Once you get used to this the story changes a lot (own experience).<br />It is true that you don't find here many real world examples, but simply the book is not intended for this purpose. If you want this try another one. <br />In sum, if you want a good background in theory this is the benchmark (I've read Varian also and some parts of Kreps).

0897500482|4.0|Bruce Lee, got his foundation in Wing Chun Kung Fu.  When you read this book, don't misunderstand Bruce Lee's philosophy: he is offering you concepts.  The concept of throwing out everything in an art that you can't use and adding what you think is useful often leaves a watered down version each succeeding generation of new students depending upon what their teachers think useless.  Some- how I don't think that was Bruce Lee's intention or meaning!  The individual can however, develop his or her own repitoire by training in more than just one style, which was considered disloyal, when Bruce Lee was alive. Bruce Lee, wasn't about style he was about concepts, but don't forget he already got his foundation from Wing Chun, so pick an art to stay with and develop your foundation as you grow in the martial arts.  Buy this and read it several times.<br />Train hard and have fun!<br />Guro Dennis Servaes
B00007KWHP|4.0|When you face a superband like Yes, comparisons with their other works are tough to avoid, and this case is no exception. With all that's been said about &quot;Roundabout&quot; and how it brought the band to the forefront of the attention of most people, I cannot avoid to see the album and find a number of weak spots in it, when I compare it to the ones that came right before and after it, namely 'The Yes Album' (though without Wakeman and his brilliant and adventurous playing on it, I must conceed) and Yes' best album to date, 'Close to the Edge', a masterpiece from beginning to end.<br />In spite of the classics &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; and &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot;, 'Fragile' still feels a little bit &quot;rough on the edges&quot;, perhaps because of the intercalation of collective works with individual tracks. Or who knows? Maybe I needed some Roger Dean cover on the album! (just kidding...) In any case, if I were to begin my Yes collection, I'd start off with the albums I mentioned earlier. Eventually you will get to this one, though.
B00003CXIP|4.0|4.5 stars.  This is easily one of my favorite films from my teenage years.  For many reasons, this film resonates with emotional nostalgia for any man who remembers their early pre-teen years, before the magic of youth began to fade with experience.  That's what this film captures: the magic of being a young boy.  It really doesn't matter that it's set in a different era, the nature of boys will always remain the same.  One of those universal traits came under critical fire when this movie was first released.  It had to do with the amount of profanity that all the main characters use.  I staunchly defended the dialogue, to this day for that matter, knowing full well that when boys are alone together they are more likely to rebel against talking conventionally.  Be it cursing or whatever, there is a sense of unbridled freedom when no authority figures are present to reprimand your behavior.  The four lead child actors here are all excellent.  Director Rob Reiner is, at least in this film, a genuine miracle worker.  It is a rare film that has this many child actors with this much talent and intelligence conveying what it's like to be a kid at heart.  At no time did I think they were acting beyond their years, like so many other child actors fall victim to doing.  There is plenty of wit and good old-fashioned toilet humor, which is the flavor of the day with young boys; but there are also some authentic, emotional moments in the story, as well.  This is a fine film that shines with great performances, charming direction from Rob Reiner, and a thoughtful story from the novella &quot;The Body&quot; by Stephen King.  One last note concerning this DVD: there is an especially poignant featurette on the making of this movie with a final ode to the late River Phoenix.  He was the James Dean of my generation, and he is greatly missed.  This film is just a small part of his short legacy, and provides ample proof that he would have been one of the greatest actors ever.  R.I.P.
0743243307|2.0|This book keeps your interest for the about the first 50 pages and then just disintegrates to the point where you just don't care about the characters.  It was downright muddled, at times.<BR>It was all I could do to finish it.

B00005JMSE|5.0|Ovbiously, I have not seen the film either, for it has not been released yet.<br />But, I do have something to claim:<br />Guillermo del Toro may be and may not be a good filmamamker and I seriously doubt his ability to adapt comics into film form.<br />I have watched Blade 2 and, being a huge fan of the first one, have come to the conclusion that (as a filmmaker myself) Blade 2 is the third worst film that I have ever seen.<br />The first is The Matrix: Reloaded and the second is The Matrix: Revolutions.<br />Blade 2 was garbage.  It was a terrible and hediously pathetic version of who the Blade character really is.<br />The film is filled with kung-fu fighting zombie vampires, a plot that sucked worse than the makeup, and an unlimited use of cgi beyond comprehension.<br />I am doubting Guillermo del Toro but I am not doubting Hellboy.<br />After viewing the trailer, I find it hard to believe that it comes from the same director as Blade 2.<br />The cgi actually looks proper, its cast is excellent, and the story is sticking to the comic books.<br />I will be in line for this film on its opening night.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Hands down, the best album in the past ten years. I ussually don't get touched by music or lyrics...but man...when i was driving back from Tahoe I had the most amazing experience with music in my entire life! This album is like an orgasm...to make this short: The first four tracks get you started with catchy songs and amazing riffs, then the middle songs (Eriatarka and cicatriz esp, this apparatus...) massage your brain (or genitle). THEN, finally the last two songs-Televators (my favorite) and Take the vail- is when your mind has a complete orgasm. These last two songs are the most amazing things EVER! The key to this album is that your first 3 times listening to it: you HAVE to listen from start to finish (partly because the tracks run together). For me, on &quot;Televators&quot; at approximateley 7:06 i &quot;spurtted&quot; all over! Amazing...no other words to describe it...just amazing. Get it.
B000002H2H|5.0|I have RTL tied with Master of Puppets as metallica's greatest albums. Unlike MOP which takes on a heavy &amp; harsh  tone, RTL has a  broader musical blend which includes low notes, high notes, speeed , acoustics, and one thing that MOP and all the proceeding albums lacked which is melody. An amazing formula that Metallica put together by incorporating melody into metal and morphing it into a hectic pace. Obviously these guys are highly skilled musicians to pull that off because no other band has been successfull in doing that. <BR>It amazes me that this was an underground album only known to the metal community which in that time was closed off to the main stream. Just evaluating this album from a musical perspective makes it superior to all the other stuff out in those days.  That just shows high narrow minded the musical community was back then since they chose to neglect this great album and play studio produced songs that lacked energy or originality. Further proof of their stupidity is that the songs on this album have stood the test of time since people still listen to them and kids who werent even born back then know RTL.
B00006RU5B|1.0|holy crap i listened to some of these songs on napster and i got a headache and almost went to sleep. Boring, boring, BORING! Even the &quot;heavy&quot; grunge tracks are boring. All the tracks are typical mainstream rock songs. Im sorta a fan of Rage, their alot more energetic and have more EXCITING guitar riffs. If you want real innovative, rock music check out PRIMUS (all hail les claypool, best bassist ever), Dream Theatre (cool prog rock), Red hot chili peppers (the masters of funk rock), Lostprophets (their kinda mainstream but at least you can listen to it without being bored), and for harder stuff definatley older metallica and for metal the swedish band In Flames (awesome guitars and singing) THIS IS CRAP
B000002TPS|5.0|I really don't understand why metal fans keep insisting in the useless paranoia speech of &quot;selling out&quot; every time a metal band releases an album who isn't bloddy 5000 beats per minute loud and noisy as their former ones! Let's face it, Youthanasia is one of the best Megadeth albums ever. Musically and lyrically speaking. The mood is heavier, though the pace is slower than Countdown or Rust. The guitars have been tune down half a step, so it contributes to that.<BR>Musically, it is a killer! Mustaine's both vocals and riffing are amazing, very well produced and Marty does well with some amazing soloing. <BR>Sure, it isn't as &quot;Megadethish&quot; as Peace Sells or Rust, but it sure as hell is a definite highlight in this outstanding band's carrer.<BR>&quot;Addicted to Chaos&quot; is my favorite, but you can name every one of the songs in the album as quite good. Intricate, melodic, defying, dark and metalic. That sums up this masterpiece!
B000003TA4|5.0|The title says it all. If you like gritty realism pumped out in the form of music having sex with your ears, Then this is for you. Even though that comment seems a little weird, i'm nearly completely serious. Every song is excellent. I repeat, EVERY SONG IS EXCELLENT. The only ones I don't play so much are SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT and SOMETHING IN THE WAY. I don't listen to smells like teen spirit too much, because I used to literallly listen to it non stop, round the clock. I don't listen to something in the way to much simply because its pretty depressing. To conclude, Nirvana are the best band ever to exist in this little, closed minded world. Dave Grohl, Kevin Nosceligch (is that spelt right?) and of course, the incredible, one and only, KURT COBAIN. As I said, listen and learn as their music gets all funky with your ears, and of course remember, NIRVANA ARE NIRVANA!!!!!<BR>P.S. Top five songs on album (not in order of favoritism) <BR>Breed, Smells Like Teen Spririt, Come as you Are, Lounge Act and Stay Away.
0385504209|1.0|I hate this book. I can't say it enough. I hate it so much that it has produced the &quot;train wreck effect&quot; in me - I'm utterly fascinated to listen to people talk about how much they loved it. It's like a bad accident. Here's the problem. Never mind the research, never mind the accuracy. How about the &quot;fact&quot; that the three main characters - the world's foremost, Harvard-trained, EXPERT symbologist in the WORLD, an Oxford trained scholar and Sophie (what are her qualifications?) are working themselves into a lather trying - trying so very hard - to crack one of the codes that will further their efforts. And they just can't. It's too hard. The code? My 5-year old niece could figure it out - it's written BACKWARDS. How would that stump these super-sleuths? It's such a minor detail, but such an idiotic device, I literally threw the book at the wall. Between that, the ridiculous repetition of &quot;cliff-hanger&quot; chapter endings and the writing, it's enough to make someone wonder - What is wrong with everybody who loves this book?<br />Conversely, this book wins my vote for best marketing of all time.  It just makes you wish that Dan Brown would fess up that he wrote this as a joke to see how much money one can make from a brilliantly-marketed, poorly written book...
0062502182|5.0|After reading this poetic book, I am more excited about following my dream.  I plan to really go for it! To raise the stakes. To make a difference in the world. My dream is do a project that will inspire others to care more about the environment. To act. To sell their  gas-guzzling SUVs. <br />Before reading THE ALCHEMIST, I felt reticent. Too self-conscious. Now I want to get out of my rut and serve the world. I can do it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|It is often difficult to listen to a cd of a play you have seen. The loss of the visuals is an interesting thing. It forces you to really listen to the music. And the visuals in Wicked are wonderful, whether it is the scenery turning emerald green, the swinging, flying monkeys, the dragon head, the wizard's head, or the costumes. And, oh yes indeed, Elphaba flying off the stage during Defying Gravity, one of the crowning moments of any Broadway season. But the music is what carries this play, along with some wonderful singing by Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth. The songs stand alone, and very well, thank you. After two songs that set up the story the music gets &quot;turned up a notch&quot; as a famous chef once said. There is one more song, &quot;Something Bad&quot;, that is used to establish a character, but the rest of the songs are just fabulous. I can't even recommend one or two because you can't leave any off the list.<BR>If you get to New York, see the show. If not, this is the next best thing. This show is not about dancing, nor is it the wordiest play in terms of dialogue. These songs push and pull the plot along and are great. These two women are going to be nearly impossible to replace, but especially Idina. She is the soul of the show and each time she sings the audience reaction is the same. Total quiet, soon to be replaced by broad smiles and head shaking, followed by an ovation. She is more wonderful than the wizard, who is actually well done by Joel Grey. Norbert Lee Butz is excellent as Fiyero. I thought his live work is better than the recorded versions. I saw this show with ten family members, who bought seven cds on the way out of the theater. You would too. If you have read the book you will find this considerably lighter, but actually better. The twists and turns at the end are excellent fun. But it all comes down to the songs and the singing, and for that Amazon does not have nearly enough stars.

B000002L99|5.0|After David Lee Roth either left Van Halen or was fired, Eddie and the gang hired Sammy Hagar, and you would expect total disaster. Not so. This album has one good song after another, and Hagar's vocals outshine Roth's any day. Get this one, the debut, OU812, FAIR WARNING, 1984, and FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWLEDGE first, then move on to the others. But don't- I repeat DON'T- clutter your living space with DIVER DOWN.
B0000B1OE7|1.0|This anime isn't for children or the overly sensitive.  It's not as mysogenist as some people say.  It takes place in feudal Japan where the social climate concerning women was less than egalitarian.  In fact, this movie makes social commentary on it and it is one of the main themes.  Sure, there's some male chovanist fan fare but 90% of the anime industry is that.  90% of all movies out there are that.  The female character is essentially in opposition to this.<br />In terms of action, this movie has an over the top feel.  It's over indulgent.  I personally feel it's done extremely well.<br />I get the feeling the same people who were offended by this movie might be the same type who would call Starship Troopers a facsist movie.  They miss the point of the movie completely - an entirely shallow perception.<br />Now for the reason why I gave this DVD 1 star.<br />IT'S NOT WIDESCREEN AS IT SAYS ON THE BOX!  THEY JUST CUT THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM OFF THE IMAGE, THUS MAKING THE IMAGE EVEN SMALLER THAN 4:3 TV FORMAT.  THOSE PEOPLE YOU USED TO HEAR IN THE VIDEO RENTAL STORE COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW THE MOVIE THEY RENTED HAD THE TOP AND BOTTOM CUT OFF... WELL THIS DVD MAKES THEM RIGHT!<br />The good points about this DVD are 5.1 and 6.1 Japanese and English dialogue, and stereo French and Spanish.  The older version only has Stereo Japanese and English.<br />If you already have Ninja Scroll you might consider spending your money elsewhere unless you have a 5.1 or 6.1 system and need to have this sound format.  If you don't already have Ninja Scroll, then you might just consider buying this version for the sake of future proofing...
B000002KM6|5.0|FAIR WARNING is the most serious album that Van Halen ever made- and it's one of the best. Every note seems to be a warning that if you screw up, you'll lose your health and your looks. It is essential listening for anyone who doesn't want to wind up on the street or in the hospital. It may not have the pop appeal of the debut, 1984, or 5150, but it's a great cautionary masterpiece that I've learned lots from.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I first bought this video when it came out 10 years ago...and needless to say...it works.  I lost 30 pounds (the right way) in four months and felt better than ever.

B000002KH3|5.0|Van Halen's self-titled debut is a great prototype for all the heavy metal to come out of California in the 80s, as well as a great item in its own right. The songs are all great (with the exception of the awful, sexist \\"Ice Cream Man\\", of course), and Eddie Van Halen's guitar work is a prototype for all that came afterwards. Get this album, FAIR WARNING, 1984, 5150, OU812, and FOR UNLAWFUL CARNAL KNOWLEDGE all at once, then get the others.
B00013F38K|5.0|I so welcome the long overdue release of one of the finest productions to ever grace our TV screens, past and present. To appropriately quote a proverb, &quot;Nature, Time, and patience are the three great physicians.&quot;  Well, for those who loved this show, and those who wish to be introduced to it, we need be patient no longer.  I care little for wide screen, ratio's, full screen technicalities.  The magic, power, artistic vision, and mystique of this show are encapsuled perfectly here.  This show was ahead of its time, sort of out of time.  After viewing the episodes again after so long, they have proven to be ageless,and pertinent.  Carradine was born for this role.  I am happy to see him regain a modicum of popularity again with the &quot;Kill Bill&quot; series.  But Kung Fu was, and will always be, his legacy, indelibly recorded for all of us to enjoy and benefit from.  He should be proud of this achievement, as should all who made this series what it is.  It is excellence.  Take the trip again.  It is so welcome.
0385504209|5.0|I am not the one addicted to detective stories, but I really like this book. Actually, I am not an expect at architectures, arts, history and religions, so I don't know which part of the book is the fact and which part is not. But I can say..this book brings me a different kind of view towards Christianity and Catholicism. Also, I can see the author, Dan Brown, has been much efforts on writing this book and done a lot of research.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Master and Commander really is the best of its kind. People say its boring but the movie really does have a sence of exploration which is just as important then the battle sequences it has. Great story. Great action, Great music, and Great acting by paul bettany and my faviorite actor Russell Crowe. He truly is one of the best actors in hollywood which makes him perfect to play jack aubrey. His best work is playing historical charcters anyways. Gladiator-oscar, Beatiful mind-should have won oscar.I work at a movie theater so I got to watch it plenty of times. It made me go out and read the rest in the series which if a movie can do that like this or lord of the rings did, then it Has to be a success right? If it wasnt for lotr It would have one alot more gold on oscar night. Cant wait for it to come out on dvd.

B00014TJ6Q|5.0|I don't care what anyone says, this has always been my favorite George Album.  I love All Things Must Pass, but Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production of it makes it a bit over the top for contemporary listening.  George even said that himself.  This album though, simply titled &quot;George Harrison&quot; is a wonderful masterpiece that was appreciated when it was released in 1979, but hasn't gotten it's due since.  It is one of the LAST albums that George produced that still sounded, for lack of a better word, &quot;Beatley&quot;.  More than a few of these tracks would comfortably fit on a Beatles album.  This is true of most of George's work in the '70's, when the breakup was still fresh and all four of the guys were dealing with the huge issues and insecurities that surrounded it.  I think all of them did some of their best work during this time -- really.  There was a lot of pressure for all of them during this time, and back then none of us listening figured they were measuring up -- but we were comparing them to the BEATLES.  When you listen to these songs now, many years after all the baggage has washed away, you're left with A LOT of really good stuff that is just a joy to listen to -- like this.<br />Great job on the remastering -- I haven't heard a decent reproduction of &quot;Blow Away&quot; in over 25 years -- I really missed it and I'm glad to have it back.
B00007BK2N|2.0|Well i just got finished watching 24 hr party people/ I am a fan of new order and joy division and i thought since i liked them maybe i would like this movie or it would be half decent. It looked intruiging when i first started watching it then the thing went on n on and didnt really give me any information i didnt know- it was a very strange movie/if you would like to watch some english guy who started out funny then turn into more boring and boring and see pigeons poisoned and stupid stuff then watch this , i doubt new order or joy division were as idiotic as this in real life-the characters were annoying as hell , after listening to these english people talk the accent lost all its charm, i couldnt wait for the film to end about a hour and a half into it and when it finally ended i said is that it? This didnt help me understand new order or joy division or any of the other bands and the music is the best thing in the film. I did get an idea of how the whole music/rave scene came to be but other than that this film has nothing new to offer. I am shocked it got so many good reviews. Like i said i love new orders music but i wouldve liked to see more about them and thier life storys and how they came to be and focus more on the characters but this went from band to band and you couldnt really follow it or understand the characters. Lacked character depth/was mediocre at best. I would like to see another movie based on these bands but make it a better more interesting film. Overall- 2.5 stars i also recomend Velvet Goldmine which is a great film. 5 stars/
B0000C7GG2|5.0|I heard the Muse's old stuff and it was Radiohead ripoff material.  Sorry to those who loved Showbiz.  However, this; this is an album showing a band coming into its own ridiculously gorgeous self.  This album is as otherworldly crazy as Queen, but with better melody, if you can believe that to be possible.  Every song starts off for just a few seconds like a crappy Korn song, but just when you get disappointed it breaks into an amazing song with a whitewash of power.  The lead singer, Bellamy, hits notes Thom Yorke could never reach.  The whole thing is just so gloriously over the top you'll feel like it has to be a guilty pleasure.  But its not!  Be proud and play it at full volume!
B00013PHGS|5.0|You can put this album in and just let it play all the way through.  They improve each album...this is by far Air's best album yet and following close behind is Moon Safari.  This music is so chill you just wanna go to the beach and chill, and probably jump on a surfboard or somethin'.  It definitely takes you to another place, wherever is on your imagination, but I assure you the place will be phat.
0767827716|3.0|This is &quot;John Capenter's&quot; Christine--not Stephen King's Christine. The film takes the basic idea of the film much the same way Kubrick took the basic idea of the Shining and made it his own. While the book is better--a book is a book and a film is a film. There was no way at the time that John Carpenter could've staged the scenes with Christine back in 1983. Even now the budget would be huge. I'm speaking of Darnell's death and the death of Buddy out on the icy roads. John Carpenter may not be fond of this film but he should be--it's one of his last films that looked and felt like a &quot;John Carpenter film.&quot; The cinematography is fantastic, the music is classic Carpenter music, and it's pretty well acted. It may not be the most frightening King adaptation but it's one of the best directed (technically) and one of the best photographed. All in all it's one of Carpenter's best; after all it is his version of the book. Changes aside, it's well worth the viewing considering the mindless, no-talent crap that passes for horror these days at the cinema.
0345457684|5.0|Ever since I saw Blade Runner as a kid, I've been in love with the idea of blending science-fiction with crime, and this is a totally compelling mix of the two. Set about 500 years in the future, the story follows Takeshi Kovacs, a former space marine who has been &quot;resleeved&quot; to investigate a suicide on Earth. You see, in the future, one's mind or consciousness can be digitized and stored in &quot;stacks&quot; implanted in the base of your skull. If you commit a crime, your stack is removed and placed in storage for the duration of your sentence (usually decades or centuries), and then you are &quot;resleeved&quot; in a new body. Of course, resleeving costs, and for many people, a new body is like a new car or new house, with monthly payments to keep up lest your body get repossessed...<br />The flip side of this is that dying is only a temporary thing-unless your stack has been somehow destroyed and there's no backup, then you're subject to &quot;RD&quot; (real death). And if you've got enough money to get into cloning and data storage, one can live a virtually endless and seamless life. It's one of these &quot;Meths&quot; (after Methuselah, just one example of the excellent creation of slang in the book), who has Takeshi remanded and &quot;needlecast&quot; (digitally freighted) from offworld to investigate his alleged suicide in Bay City (aka San Francisco). Takeshi had been in prison, having been captured as a mercenary in a vibrantly kinetic prologue.<br />The meth, Bancroft, is one of the future elite, weaving elaborate corporate and political webs with others of his kind. Apparently he committed suicide a few weeks ago, but he's convinced it was murder. He's paid heftily to have Kovacs released and resleeved to investigate his death and what happened in the 48 hours leading up to it-48 hours that elapsed between his last stack backup and his temporary death. This is a great setup, as we have a reluctant protagonist grudgingly working on a case for a sinister Bancroft, quickly getting caught up with Bay City PD, Bancroft's hyper-sexy wife, and all kinds of foes.<br />It's an extremely convoluted tale, with lots of double-crossing, plot twists, hidden agendas, sexual tension (and outright graphic sex), dry tough guy humor, and excellent action sequences. It's so jam-packed it almost gets overwhelming at times, and one wishes Morgan had been able to trim just a little bit here and there. However, he's built a very intriguing and nasty future earth, where-as one might well imagine-a lot of the technology gets channeled into the sex trade. This is great pulp fiction, with great characters, including my favorite: the AI Hendrix Hotel. It's a hotel that runs itself using artificial intelligence, making for a hilarious, yet plausible, character. This is a great genre-blending debut, let's hope the sequel (Broken Angels) is as good.sinister Bancroft, quickly getting caught up with Bay City PD, Bancroft's hyper-sexy wife, and all kinds of foes.<br />It's an extremely convoluted tale, with lots of double-crossing, plot twists, hidden agendas, sexual tension (and outright graphic sex), dry tough guy humor, and excellent action sequences.

B00005JL3A|1.0|I really don't like writing negative reviews.  I like to write about things I enjoy, it makes the process of writing reviews much more enjoyable.  But every now and again something so rotten comes along that I've gotta say something.  This is the case with Resident Evil.  Hollywood seems to be getting into a zombie phase these days.  This is scary coz Hollywood knows about as much about making a good zombie flick as I know about nuclear fusion.  History has shown us that all great zombie flicks have been made outside the system.  There are many reasons I hate this film, but here's the top two:  1) I'm a fan of George Romero, and 2) I'm a fan of the video game series.  Resident Evil is a game based on the works of George Romero, yet Romero wasn't allowed to do this film.  Just like a previous reviewer, I have also read some of Romero's original script for Resident Evil.  If he made it, it would have been superb.  Why wasn't it chosen?  Probably coz it was intelligent, it actually stuck very close to the story, it would have been about two hours long, and it would have been too gory for an R rating.  In other words-for people who like good horror films and not cruddy rock video type films.  Instead the studios figured that they'd go with Paul Anderson since he directed another lame movie version of a video game.  This film actually has a decent opening sequence, but falls flat on it's face afterwards.  Anderson decided to take it upon himself to change the story, and not for the better either.  Now everthing is all high tech and computerized.  Part of the scariness of the game was it's simplicity.  It's down and dirty approach to survival.  We have yet another clone of 2001's HAL in the form of a computer security system called the Red Queen(oooooh, scary).  Everything's a cliche in this film, no surprises.  The soundtrack is dated and annoying.  It's full of that lame Matrix slo-mo junk we've seen a million times before, as well as those lame VanDamme-esque slo-mo kicks and punches.  The &quot;Licker&quot; is pitiful.  I've seen scarier creatures in Fraggle Rock.  The cast is all pretty people, not real looking people.  All of the scientists in the beginning are hot women!  Yeah, right.  There's a scene stolen from the movie, &quot;Cube&quot;.  There's basically no gore.  Sorry to sound so shallow, but the sad fact is that gore is required for a zombie film.  The only positive I can think of is the zombie dogs which looked good.  But that's the only good I could find out of an hour and forty minutes.  I feel so sorry for Romero.  He's really been getting the green weenie lately.  First, he's screwed out of Resident Evil, then some no-talent hack by the name of Zack Snyder remakes Dawn Of The Dead!  And this is Romero's genre!  He made this genre, now they're treating him like a doormat.  Accept no imitations and make it a Romero night!cks and punches.  The &quot;Licker&quot; is pitiful.

We had the greatest summer Xmas holidays imaginable (seeing both Led Zep &amp; The Stones a few weeks apart), at 18 this was heaven. This DVD is surely a work of art, put together by Jimmy Page with all the care &amp; love he shows his guitars. I just wish it was 20 hours long.

B00018TI5E|5.0|After gorgeous &quot;to record wateer for ten days only&quot; and two avantgarde previous releases Frusciante was touring with RHCP,he released another minimal music album through the internet. while first news about new studio release appeared i thouhgt that it will be another acoustic and drum machine based collection of introspective melancholic songs. i was wrong. i was truly shocked when i bought it and switched on my cd player. i also didin't knew any songs from it before.<br />&quot;carvel&quot; starts with ambient bubling but around 1.30 it grows into powerfull rocker.we have Bass,real drums,keyboards,guitars,clean good production - almost everything that was missing on his previous efforts.even John's vocals sound more powerfull.<BR>other songs including highlights like &quot;in relief&quot;,&quot;cut-out&quot;,&quot;the slaughter&quot; and &quot;every person&quot; are amazing melodic guitar based songs with very personal lyrics.some cuts sound like some red hot's &quot;by hte way&quot; b sides (&quot;water&quot;,&quot;this cold&quot;). Frusciante's best friend,Josh Kilinghoffer plays amazingly on drum set and bass guitar,he even gets lead vocals on haunting &quot;Ommision&quot;. My favourite songs is powerfull &quot;Time goes back&quot; were vocals,guitars and heavy bass sound just perfect.i bnet that it would be a hit if promoted by video and released as a single. There are three experimental ambient songs like creepy &quot;000ghost7&quot; that sound much different and wierd but they grow on you with every listening.<br />Overall,it is amazing piece of true rock genius,Fru is Ten years younger than all RHCP crew and he is still their most talented member. A stunning piece of music,get it now!

B00006WKSZ|5.0|How could I possibly top the other reviewer's comments?  This is the album I rocked to when I was a kid taking Dad's car out with my buddies.  We'd slap the 8-track recording I had of this and feel just like Beavis and Butthead would've felt.  Uli Roth is hands down one of the most phenomenal guitar visionaries I've ever heard.  When I was in the military I had a great friend who grew up in the neighborhood in Germany where the Scorpions lived.  He was a bit younger than they but just at the timing of their departure into the stars.
0156027321|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked The Life of Pi.  The graphic way in which animal deaths were conveyed was a little disturbing, and I felt that it was a little gratuitous.  Merely describing the death would have been enough without such detail.  I also wanted to throw this book out of the window at times because of the wordiness of the author.  I found myself saying out loud &quot;Alright, I got it.  Move on&quot;!  I stuck with it, and ended up really enjoying the book.  I've read reviews about people having spiritual epiphanies from reading the book.  I did not.  I saw the spiritual aspect, and it made me think a bit, but it certainly wasn't life altering.  I would have given this book 4 stars had it not been so wordy at times and had the animal deaths been a bit less graphic.  Definitely worth the read though.
037542217X|4.0|The Kalahari Typing School for Men continues as the fourth installment in the fine series about Botswana's first lady detective, Mma. Precious Ramotswe, which was begun in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and followed by Tears of the Giraffe and Morality for Beautiful Girls.  Alexander McCall Smith does a fine job of providing the background from the first three novels in the opening of this one, and the book is almost as stand-alone as The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.  The Kalahari Typing School for Men continues several themes in the prior books including the superiority of women over men, the importance of being organized and diligent, following your heart and spirit to do the right thing . . . in the right way, and intriguing questions about what is moral behavior in complex situations.<br />The book continues its humorous backdrop as Precious finds herself up against an experienced male competitor who opens the Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency.  The competitor proves to be very annoying to Precious, and she struggles to maintain her optimism in the face of this new trial.<br />With Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni back working energetically at Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, Mma. Makutsi finds herself dissatisfied.  She's really operating as a secretary to both companies rather than as an assistant detective and acting manager, as she had done before.  When a new client shows up and insists on speaking with Precious alone, Mma. Makutsi's unhappiness grows.  But she shakes herself off, and finds a new opportunity in establishing The Kalahari Typing School for Men, the most unique educational establishment you will probably ever read about.<br />Precious deals with two client cases . . . neither of which is really a mystery in the normal literary sense.  But deciding how to represent her clients' best interests provides weighty challenges of Biblical proportions.<br />I was a little disappointed in the book, though.  Unlike the earlier three books, it lacks the powerful presence of wild Africa to add character and spice.  Increasingly, I felt like I was reading just another comic novel about a woman who is trying to juggle all of the balls at once without dropping one.  While that is certainly entertaining, this book lacked the uniqueness that made the other books such continuing and pleasant surprises.<br />As I finished the book, I thought about the special relationship between novelists and their readers.  When a novelist establishes a character and a setting for a series of novels, readers expect that what makes that character and setting precious to them will continue.  When a book attempts to go off in a new direction, readers should be glad of the author's willingness to experiment.  But I do think that the author should provide a valuable substitute if precious elements are left behind.  For example, if this novel had been set in an intriguing new locale because Precious had to move, the pleasure of learning about that locale would have made the book's switch in direction worthwhile.<br />Novelists, keep your implicit promises to your readers!powerful presence of wild Africa to add character and spice.

B00000EYGW|5.0|I love this album: it's utterly creative, deep, and vexing. The poetry in Smith's lyrics are abstract and web-like, but lend themselves to an &quot;outer essence&quot; of imagination that allows the listener to flow along with each song. I think it's the most imaginative album I've ever heard. I'm serious-- it's like a sand storm in a desert: there are fragments in the general poetry like wind tunnels and small bits of sand that create small moments of innuendo within the overall song/expression itself. Smith's expressions are typically sad and desolate, kind of hollow, so these fragments follow nicely with the Cure's usual lonely, &quot;missing you&quot; quality. An example of this is when Smith sings &quot;I'll dust your lemon lies, with powder pink and sweet, the day you stop is the day you change, fly away, away with me&quot; on Bananafishbones. He sings in his usual weepy tone, over melodies and bass that are sad and echo-y, but the lyrics are sweet. I love this album, although in the grand scheme of Cure records, it is quirky, and I think it's their first attempt at a more stolid, upbeat ideology; it may be why I like it-- the seeds of change... <BR>This record isn't as overtly sad as other albums. It does &quot;fly away&quot; from their usual, and previews the later &quot;Love Song&quot; phase of the Cure.<BR>The other songs on the album can be creepy at first, because these fragments are odd, and follow a dark pattern. Shake Dog Shake is loud and lusty for a Cure song, and are about as pissed off as Smith gets. Wailing Wall is deep and perplexing, and reminds me of Faith. Oddly, writing about each song on this album, they all reach backwards or forwards in the Cure library. Shake Dog Shake reminds me of the Head on the Door.<BR>Thinking of the album as a whole, I think this is the Cure's most angry album. It's a transitional album and one that Smith's attempts to express himself might even seem thwarted by his own emotion. I think it may get in the way of some people's wishes for a Cure album. It's personal on that level, and it's an attempt to progress; some may not understand it.
B0000C6E4D|2.0|I'm one of those fans that jumps at any new album by Sarah (or Tori for that matter) but consider this one close to a waste. The album flows so much from one song to another that I can barely tell when one starts and another stops. All the songs are ok, but it's overall its lackluster to fans who love her more up-beat early albums, remixes or B-sides. If you're just getting into Sarah from her radio playlist, look for her Rarities, Bsides and other stuff album instead-- it's fabulous.
B000002L9M|4.0|The Amazon review that postulates that \\"Black Celebration\\" was the album thousands of dyed hair and make-up kids in the late 80's poured their alienated hearts out over hits it square on the head. \\"Black Celebration\\" is almost unmatched in its relentless gloom-mongering and only on the closing \\"But not Tonight\\" does the tone turn even vaguely optimistic. (Oddly enough, it's the one song to which the lyrics are omitted.) Not that the music wasn't outstanding. That was the main attraction about the richer sounding \\"Black Celebration.\\" The state of the synthesizer had risen considerably since \\"Some Great Reward,\\" and the breakthrough of Compact Discs had just begun. It brought a fuller sound out of Depeche Mode and gave them more room to deepen -- or maybe darken -- their sound. They had also stumbled into areas when less meant more, as the haunting \\"Stripped\\" exemplifies.<br />Just because the mood was dark also did not mean \\"Black Celebration\\" stayed mired in dirges. The frantic tempo of \\"A Question of Time\\" continued DM's ongoing string of modern rock dance singles, keeping them astride the likes of New Order and positioning them as the anti-Duran Duran. (Even though all three of these bands were at their creative peaks in this period.) The DM videos were getting better and it was just one more album before all three bands were world wide massive stars at the same time!!! (Duran Duran with \\"Big Thing,\\" New Order with \\"Substance\\" and Depeche Mode with \\"Violator.\\") It was certainly heady times for lovers of synth-rock, and \\"Black Celebration\\" remains one of my favorite CDs from that period.
B000002KAT|5.0|I have gone thirty years of living without having heard Astral Weeks. It took me one day of listening to it over and over to be &quot;changed forever.&quot; Every reviewer of this album will always come to the same conclusion, you just can't describe to someone how or why this music is so incredible. Breaking the pieces of the songs down-vocals, lyrics, instrumentals-none of these things are outstanding if taken on their own. But together, it truly is something magical. I couldn't tell you really what the lyrics are trying to say. You can't say that Van has a beautiful voice. The pure passion and soul with which he sings blows away any need for clean pitch or tones. All you know is, whatever he is singing, he really, really means it.<br />Anyone who loves music, not some machine made bass beat, but music, must have this album. MUST. If music makes you feel, touches or moves you, you must have this. Put it in your CD player and  keep it there.
B00003CXXM|3.0|The Bourne Identity (Doug Liman, 2002)<br />Why we need fluffy remakes of movies has been hotly debated in Hollywood for decades. (After all, it's nothing new. Bunuel's 1977 film That Obscure Object of Desire was the sixth adaptation of Louys' novel Woman and Puppet.) After all, rarely is the remake even watchable, much less on a par with the original.<br />This is one of the exceptions. The new version of The Bourne Identity, directed by Doug Liman of Go fame, contains all the fluff factor of an awful remake yet remains watchable in a turn-your-brain-off way. Jason Bourne is portrayed here by Matt Damon, who shows that he really can be something other than Ben Affleck's geeky best friend. Obligatory love interest Marie is played by indie darling Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), and a well-cast batch of supporting characters keep the acting level higher than one normally gets from this sort of thing while never quite taking themselves too seriously. (The exception to that last bit is Chris Cooper, playing Bourne's boss, but then he's supposed to be a high-strung neurotic.)<br />Good, solid fun from beginning to end. ***
B00004Y6NV|5.0|Dire Straits have evolved quite a bit during their 13-years-long career. Started with mellow blues-oriented pub-rock, they went through poppy aproach (&quot;Making Movies&quot;), prog-rock approach (&quot;Love Over Gold&quot;), and finally became MTV-darlings after their large commercial success of &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. Six years of silence after that left everyone wondering about the direction Mark Knopfler would head with &quot;On Every Street&quot;. I think, Mark struck everybody off their feet with how un-commercial this album sounds. He seems to throw away any public success considerations he might have had, and recorded 12 songs to his own liking. While this album never reached the super-stardom of its predecessor, I consider it to be perhaps the best thing Dire Straits have ever made.<br />Mark demonstrates solid growth as a songwriter and arranger. And his virtuoso guitar playing needs no introduction. He never shows off his guitar skills, instead inserting very tasteful and moody licks and solos here and there. This album presents very diverse material. From excellent blues tracks &quot;Fade to Black&quot; and &quot;Planet of New Orleans&quot;, to calmness of &quot;On Every Street&quot; and &quot;Iron Hand&quot;, to rocking &quot;Calling Elvis&quot; and almost hard-rocker &quot;Heavy Fuel&quot;, to classic rock-n-roll &quot;The Bug&quot;, Dire Straits deliver it all. They also added plenty of new instruments to the songs, like a full brass section in &quot;My Parties&quot;, a sax in a couple of tracks, some orchestration, and something that sounds to me like a war horn on &quot;Iron Hand&quot;. The pub-rock roots are almost gone, and instead there's a flavour of country-music over this record. This change makes it obvious, that Dire Straits have expressed everything they were about, and there won't ever be another DS record. Mark decided to pursue solo career, that takes off musically exactly where &quot;On Every Street&quot; ends.<br />This album is an hour of a very high quality and mostly calm material with some impressive performance by the band. Highly recommended!
B00005YXZH|4.0|i highly recommend this cd. its great for just mellow good listening. i didnt give it five stars because its not really that kind of album that reallllllly moves you (except for maybe the song \\"radio cure\\" and \\"im trying to break your heart\\"). but it is a VERY enjoyable album to listen to. <br />i would cite favorite tracks but i enjoy them all. but i guess \\"radio cure\\" really stands out. i find \\"heavy metal drummer\\", which i love, very pavement-esque. and the first song of course.<br />buy this album.
B0001611DI|5.0|Hard to believe that it's been a quarter of a century since George A. Romero unleased DAWN OF THE DEAD on unsuspecting moviegoers! Even to this day, DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the scariest horror movies of all time, and in some respects even better than NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD! I just love the way that this film opens, in pure chaos! We are thrown right into the action and never look back; it's all gone to Hell when the dead are walkin' the Earth! Too bad the critics (and some fans) fail to recognize the full force of Romero's satire of consumerism, a trend which sadly continues to this day. The satire isn't as subtle as those critcs would lead you to believe, in fact Romero knocks consumerism and the influence of shopping malls on society front and center; the dehumanization of the four survivors who hide out in the mall by consumerism makes the living dead seem normal by comparison, and that's precisely the point that Romero makes here.<BR>George A. Romero is my favorite horror movie director. His approach to horror in modern society is amazing! Every horror movie he does, particularly NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE CRAZIES, MARTIN, DAWN and DAY OF THE DEAD, and CREEPSHOW is a sign of the times disguised as some truly terrifying horror and disarray. Romero also manages to take on authority, and the Military in particular (THE CRAZIES and DAY OF THE DEAD), presenting a paranoid vision that those in positions of power are the real bad guys. That Romero can find and present terrifying stories in even the smallest details of everyday life (see his newest film BRUISER, a take on Kafka) is a testament to Romero's longevity in the horror genre!<BR>But what I found to be most enjoyable about DAWN was the involvement of Dario Argento! After getting into Argento's movies (SUSPIRIA, INFERNO, TWO EVIL EYES, DEEP RED, and TENEBRE), I began to appreciate DAWN more than I did when I first saw it. Argento put up the money for DAWN, served as script consultant, and provided the awesome music he did with his favorite band Goblin. The music is amazing and really drives home the terror of the story! The other thing that I love about DAWN is how shocking Tom Savini's makeup effects are even today, especially towards the end! DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the reasons why the 1970's was a great decade for horror!<BR>I just had to get this new edition just to see what the Silver Anniversary set coming out this fall will be like. And I'm glad that I did! The new hi-def transfer and widescreen framing is a revelation, light years beyond any other presentation of this movie over the years! The 5.1 surround tracks add new life to Goblin's score and the soundtrack itself! Plus, you have got to hear the commentary by George and his wife Chris, Tom Savini, and DVD producer Perry Martin; it's an enlightening and funny commentary not to be missed! If you're a major fan of DAWN OF THE DEAD or need to understand the movie before you see the remake that's coming shortly, you can't go wrong with this disc, presented in its US Theatrical version. For all DAWN fans, this is the perfect way to see the incredible job Anchor Bay will do with DAWN OF THE DEAD later this year!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Let me start off by saying I viewed the original matrix as the greatest sci fi movie of all time. followd by EMPIRE and RELOADED and BLADE RUNNER however let me state that before they could be viewed as great sci fi movies they had to be good movies<br />This is a very boring movie. And the pacing strangles what's left.<BR> At times I swear the WACHOWSKI BROS. were making fun of themselves. They screwed this movie up in so many ways they had to be doing it on purpose.<BR>I was trying to figure out if they answered any questions from part 2 then they kept going with the riddles.<br /> If you want a text book lesson on how not to make a movie watch this masterpiece.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I know this word gets thrown around a lot in this country and it loses its true meaning, but the matrix trilogy is truly a phenomenon.  <br />I personally rate the matrix higher above all the SCI-FICTION trilogies including STAR WARS and THE LORD OF THE RINGS.<br />The critics hailed the first installment of the matrix but went completely down hill on the 2nd and 3rd installments.<br />The matrix is a trilogy, not a one off film. So I wish people would stop with the They should have stopped after the first film. <br />The first film had possibly the best special effects the 20th century has ever seen. The 2nd and 3rd film truly brought in the 21st century.<br />The 3rd film on the other hand I found to be the most anticipated in the world. The Neo VS Smith Showdown and the end of the trilogy was truly a calendar watcher!<br />-------------<br />The Matrix Revolutions had dazzling special effects and entertainment. <BR>The only thing I strongly didnt approve of is the ending. <BR>I would like to have seen the hailed destruction of the matrix and the entire human race set free into the real world.<br />The Neo VS Smith Showdown was what I personally was most anticipating. It was wonderful. I felt my expectations were more than fulfilled, and enjoyed it from beginning to end.<br />The massive machine VS human showdown in Zion was a huge CGI scene. <BR>The third installment has the most special effects in the trilogy and to what I've seen in all of film history.<br />Its true the story line was a bit stiff in the 2nd and 3rd film, but its how it had to be played out to fit the trilogy.<br />I would recommend this film more than any other!<BR>OWN THE TRILOGY!<br />Truly a 10/10 experience.
B00005JMEW|1.0|Want to feel disgusted and depressed for almost two hours? Watch this senseless sexually violent piece of tripe. Whatever happened to writing a good story and presenting it in a creative way? I guess if you think that rape and sodomy of a comatose woman is funny, then this movie is for you. The violence and horror is completely tasteless and certainly not enough to save this movie from being banal and idiotic.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I have to say this CD is so much fun!!! I am not really big on this type of music but I saw the video for 'Hey Mama' and was hooked. The entire CD is awesome, but my fave is still 'Hey Mama'. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD and dance your heart out!!
B00000GAIW|4.0|I remember when Aqualung was just released, and everybody had the album. It was extremely popular here in Denmark, along with &quot;Who`s Next&quot; and the Led Zeppelin and Ten Years After albums. It probably Tull`s most hard-rocking album, and at least at that time it was comsidered &quot;heavy&quot; rock.<br />I saw them perform in Holstebro with new member John Evan - and it was really a great hard rocking performance; I was very impressed by guitarist Martin Barre.<br />Songs like &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; and &quot;Aqualung&quot; are great live rockers - but also very melodic.<br />I never cared much for &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary&quot;, &quot;Hymn 43&quot; and &quot;Up to Me&quot;, but acoustic songs like &quot;Cheap Day Return&quot;, &quot;Mother Goose&quot; and &quot;Wondering Aloud&quot; and still favourites of mine.<br />&quot;My God&quot; is too much an integrated part of the album-concept to be judged on its own.<br />The highlight is the great finale &quot;Wind Up&quot;<br />There are six bonus tracks.<br />&quot;Lick Your Finger Clean&quot; is okay for an outtake.<br />the alternate version of &quot;Wind Up&quot; is interesting, but not nearly as good as the released version.<br />The Ian Anderson interview is very interesting, as is the BBC takes of &quot;Song for Jeffrey&quot;, &quot;Fat Man&quot; and &quot;Bouree&quot;.
B00008PC2O|3.0|A caution about this version of T2. The second disc of this 2 dvd set is recorded in encrypted Microsoft Windows Media 9 format. I purchased it based on my very favorable experience with \\"Coral Reef Adventure\\" (also on dual dvd and WM9 Hi-Def dvd formats). <br />For those not familiar with the WM9 Hi-Def format, it will only playback on a Windows XP computer with the latest version of Windows Media 9 installed. Furthermore, the disc will insist on installing the InterActual DVD Player, version 2.0. This, would be OK, in my opinion, were it not for the fact that: (1) the installation of the player requires an update, which, in turn, requires that IE6 be your default browser; if not, you get into an endless loop trying to install the update from a non-windows browser like Mozilla Firefox or Opera; and (2) unless you are under 13 year of age, the InterActual player insists on collecting \\"annonymous\\" demograpic info every time you play this \\"hi-def\\" version of the film. It also insists on the user providing his correct email address, zipcode, sex and age! Of course, you could provide misinformation here. Having paid good money for this 2 disc set, I see no justification, at all, for any form of snooping on my viewing habits - annonymous or not. Nor do I see why I should be forced to provide info about myself. If this doesn't change ASAP, this will be the last time I buy any Microsoft Hi-Def movie disc.<br />The WM9 Hi-Def version of this film is only minimally better than the standard dvd version on disc 1. On a good playback system using a decent progressive dvd player with component output to a good plasma or CRT monitor, I think the standard dvd displays about 98% of what you see on the so called \\"Hi-Def\\" version on disc 2, and you don't have to jump through hoops to install it and be annoyed by unwelcomed snooping of your viewing habits. Interestingly, another hi-def flick using WM9 called \\"Coral Reef Adventure\\" doesn't have any of the drawbacks of T2, and is an awesome hi-def experience at either 720P or 1080P. \\"Coral Reef Adventure\\" is very highly recommend and does not require installation of the InterActual Player. Also, Coral Reef Adventure will show you what a difference there is between the standard 480i dvd version and the 720P/1080P Hi-Def version - provided you have the right equipment(for 720P you will need a 2.4 GHz cpu; 4x AGP video card and monitor that can display 1280x720. For 1080P, you'll need a 3.0+ GHZ cpu; 8x AGP video card and monitor than can display 1920x1080.<br />As for T2 - Extreme Edition, if you must have this version, skip disc 2 and watch disc 1 only, better yet, buy T2-Ultimate Edition instead.<br />I give disc 1 - 4 stars for the film and display quality.<BR>I give disc 2 - 2 stars because of the difficulty created by Microsoft's Draconian installation and the InterActual Player's unappreciated demand for any form of user personal information and \\"annonymous\\" demographic snooping.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|This album is pure heavy metal!!! Tony Martin, Tony Iommi, Cozy Powell and Neil Murray gave the best of  them to this album that has nine excellent songs.The voice of Tony Martin is amazing and Iommy has very good solos in this album.   Great music,low price,what are you waiting for?!
B0001906O0|5.0|I own around 1000 albums, and have never bought a box set before, but the day this came out I gladly threw down the cash. It's 4 cd's, 70 songs, an excellent booklet, and basically just a perfect package for the &quot;Cure&quot; fanatic. It's well worth it for the first 2 discs alone. Half of what's here is just as good as anything off their albums, and the other half is still interesting. The highlights of each disc are &quot;Happy The Man&quot;, &quot;2 Late&quot;, &quot;Burn&quot;, and &quot;World In My Eyes&quot;. All just a hair better than the other 66 tracks. If you're thinking about this, don't, &quot;Just Say Yes&quot;.
8478886559|1.0|after reading all the Harry Potter books in english wich i enjoyed extreamly, was looking forward to find how much fun would it be to read them in spanish (my first language) also. i'm so desapointed with this \\"dictionary\\" translation, the book lacks feeling, fluidity, i find it choppy and to my amaizment was to find SO many gramar incorrectness in the book, this translation shows no real effort to capture the spirit of the caracters. it's a shame that the translators did not take advantages of all the posibilities that such a great language as spanish offers to give this book the same feeling and fun to read as the english versions.
B00018D44U|4.0|I became a Nora Jones fan with her first recording, but my interest in her career was cemented with this latest effort, Feels Like HOme. And that is exactly what it felt like to listen to the varied, blusey, country, jazzy tracks which effectively showcase Jones'talent and her knack for choosing good folks to work with. Her special guests are all special, including Dolly Parton, Jessie Harris and the Handsome Band. Each makes a contribution which enriches the diversity and appealability of the music. Jones seems to be willing to explore new areas, and does so without losing her silky, smoky trademark sound. I play this in heavy rotation as I work at my desk and in my kitchen, and so far I haven't tired of it. Great sophmore effort from a supple singer.
B00008BRDX|4.0|If you like reggae, pop, rock or The Police/Sting, buy this album. Message In a Bottle is a great track, as well as the title track and Walking on The Moon. Some tracks are forgettable, such as the final one, No Time This Time. The Police's fusion of many musical genres creates feel-good and danceable music. Some complaints are that many of their album covers look the same, and aren't original, and the remastered version doesn't contain a booklet inside the album with art and stuff. No complaints about most of the music, though.
0385504209|4.0|Only one word can describe this book, and that word is &quot;unbelievable&quot;! Dan Brown has the best writing style I have EVER seen by any author, and the points he makes are very convincing. I encourage everyone to read this book, even if you're a fundamentalist Christian, because hey, maybe it might knock some sense into ya! (lol, jk) Although this book was one of the greatest books I've ever read (if not THE greatest), the ending is terrible! I would have given this the whole 5 stars if the ending had been better, but it was a huge dissappointment!
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is set in New York, and focuses on a loner cab driver named Travis Brickle ( Robert De Niro). Travis is a somewhat mentally unstable Vietnam vet, who is sickened by the sleaze and violence that he sees at night on the streets of New York. One night, Travis has an encounter with a young prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster) and becomes determined to persuade her to leave her pimp (Harvey Kietel). As Travis slowly decends into depression, paranoia, and overall madness, he becomes determined to rid the streets of crime himself.<br />Taxi Driver is without a doubt one of the best films I have ever seen. The reason the story is so great, is because it involves a taxi driver whose only human contact is the fares that he takes, which forces him to concentrate on the worst that society has to offer. This is what makes Travis feel like he is the only solution to society's problems. The film slowly takes you through each step of Travis's decent into madness. Travis Brickle is Robert De Niro's best performance in my opinion. DeNiro's ability to slowly break down the character is amazing, and watching De Niro transform himself into a crazy vigilante will give you the creeps. This includes the classic scene with De Niro standing in front of the mirror saying &quot;You talkin to me?!!&quot;. Jodi Foster, Harvey Kietel, Peter Boyle, and the rest of the cast were all great in their roles as well.<br />Overall, Taxi Driver is one of my favorite films. The film effectively showcases the scum of society and the creation of a crazy vigilante, and Robert De Niro gives the best performance of his career. The DVD features an oustanding making of featurette featuring Robert De Niro, Jodi Foster, and director Martin Scorsese.<br />A solid 5 stars...
0784011176|5.0|Words cannot convey...and this is one of the things this incredible movie teaches us.  The Piano is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The scenery is breathtaking.  Holly Hunter is brilliant as Ada, the mute (by choice) &quot;victim&quot; of an arranged marriage.  Her facial expressions and physical movements express more than words could ever say.  In fact, I found that once I become aware of watching her gestures, I began watching the expressions of other characters in the movie also.  Harvey Kietel is cast in a very different role for him and the result is impressive and shows a much larger range of his acting ability.  The music in the film is beautiful and is Ada's true &quot;voice&quot;.  <br />This movie must not be watched in the ordinary way one would watch any other movie.  If you're just going to watch it in a literal way, this isn't the movie for you.  The Piano is a wonderous combination of music, scenery and symbolism.  It's like a dream sequence.  The movie feels almost enchanted.  The filming of 2 major scenes of violence is exquisite.  I didn't notice the violence itself so much as I felt the pain of the characters.<br />I highly recommend this film...no matter how many times I watch it, it never fails to move me.
B00005MNP8|5.0|This album was released the year I graduated from high-school, back in the time when \\"disco\\" music was all the rage.  I never liked \\"disco\\" and I tried to hide from it any way I could.  I was buying Doors and Creedence albums while everyone around me was listening to \\"Shake your Booty.\\"<br />When this album was released, it was the musical equivalent of the first day of Spring in Seattle.  A bright yet cool breeze of refreshing and invigorating rock-and-roll that sounded old yet new at the same time after a long, dreary \\"disco\\" overcast.<br />Interestingly, the very first track from this album that I heard on the radio was \\"Fade Away and Radiate\\".  I still remember cranking it up on my Superscope Hi-Fi in my room. I thought it was a brilliant example of pop musicianship (rather like like Pink Floyd) and great poetry to boot.  It also helped that I remembered watching the old vacuum-tube televisions so I could visualize the song in my mind.  What a trip!<br />\\"Heart of Glass\\" quickly became a monster hit and got so much airplay that I couldn't stand it.  Then one day I want driving with a friend and he played a cassette of Parallel Lines and I realized I had to buy the record.  I still remember walking across the Univerisity of Washington campus with my new Blondie album.<br />In my little corner of the world, I can think of no other single recording that did more to sweep \\"disco\\" music off the charts and bring back rock, this time as the \\"new wave\\".  So, I feel like I owe Blondie big time for that.<br />Ironically, the one song I really didn't like was \\"I Know but I Don't Know.\\"  I thought it was self-indulgent filler at the time, but it sounds like Mozart compared to some of the stuff that's popular today.
B00008EY9G|2.0|I find most of the reviews here genuine and I respect others opinions. I don't agree with that particular reviewer ( about a page back ) who claim others who do not like this movie aren't &quot; intelligent enough &quot; to understand it. People have their own minds and opinions. No one has the right to belittle someone because they don't like a film. I paid attention to all the reviews and found each one helpful ( except the one I mentioned above ). Intelligence is the least of it. People can hate a film like this and it does not mean they can't understand it. You dislike a film because you DO understand it. Identity was a waste of time for me. I love John Cusack but I found the film boring and slow. I could tell what was going to happen the minute I began watching. The plot is very predictable but to each's own. My review comes from the heart. I respect people who liked the film and who didn't as long as it was an honest and fair review. Give the film a try if you haven't seen it. You may like it. Some do, some didn't. But don't knock someone else's intelligence just because they don't agree with your taste.  That's why the world is different.
0553062182|3.0|This work is generally a good read in helping one understand the highly sensitive person (HSP). While the first half of the text is well written and useful, in my opinion, the latter half is a slide downhill into not only strategies intended to work with one's sensitivity, but avenues to subdue one's sensitivity. Some of the strengths of the book include the attempt of the author to differentiate the highly sensitive from the introvert and the shy (many modern psychologists are rightly coming to like conclusions that these three personality attributes are not synonymous, although some therapists unfortunately still group these three types of individuals together), her explanation of how sensitivity in many ways is a strength because the HSP is much more aware of what is going on around them than the non-HSP, and the many case studies distributed throughout the text. As with most works of this nature, there are also weaknesses that need to be mentioned. Despite the book's strengths, and my recommendation that you read this book if there is an HSP in your life, there are two weaknesses in this book that should not go unnoticed, contained within the last two chapters in the book: the author's discussions on medications and spirituality. In my opinion, medication for any purpose, including both physical and mental health, should be used in only limited circumstances - drugs should not be used as much as they are in the United States to treat people. Although people have a right to disagree with this assertion, I must say that the second and greatest weakness of this book, constrained to chapter 10, is large enough that most would probably agree with me (even if the only reason for this agreement is the fact that the content is far removed from the thesis of the book, i.e. the content digresses in a long, unrelated tangent). Aron explains that HSPs tend to be more spiritual than non-HSPs, but she goes far beyond this research finding to say that HSPs as a general rule are against &quot;organized religion&quot;, without explaining her definition of organized religion. She includes almost two full pages of quotes by supposed HSPs, which together form &quot;almost a poem&quot;, in her opinion. Included within this &quot;poem&quot; is a quote from an HSP who says that one should &quot;have fun at all costs&quot;, and another which says &quot;you get what you pray for&quot;. There is simply too much hostility in this &quot;poem&quot;, which many readers will probably categorize as a tragedy. Amid periodic bursts of insight, this &quot;Soul and Spirit&quot; chapter gets stranger, reminiscent of the book &quot;Communion&quot; by Whitley Strieber, where the author goes on a tangent about guardian angels which sound more like demons. In a related case study, a woman recalls waking up at night, seeing &quot;at the bottom of [her] bed a creature about four feet tall, hairless, not naked but in a sort of skinsuit, with minimalist features...[the creature] thought-transmitted to [her], `Don't be afraid. I'm only here to observe you'&quot;. The woman notes that she &quot;was not the least bit afraid&quot;.

B000001EHS|5.0|(This review was written by two people, so the reviews will be mixed, separated by hyphens)<br />Here's our song-by-song review<br />Pour Some Sugar On Me ***** - **** - One of the greatest choruses of the 80's - a catchy tune - cudos on the guitar and bass - could use a better bass line - great vocals - it's all good!<br />Photograph ***** - ***** - The first song to truly make it on American charts, and was #1 on my personal charts for two months - It's good, it's gold, I like it<br />Love Bites ***** - *** - Another great chorus - A good breakup song<br />Let's Get Rocked ***** - ***** - A good swing rocker & dance song - can definitely relate to it - a great road song - an excellent intro<br />Two Steps Behind *** - ** - Not as good as the electric version - could use better vocals & lyrics<br />Animal **** - **** - Perfect Chorus - Middle part leans toward a heavier genre, giving it FOUR STARS - Everything is great except for the middle <br />Foolin' ***** - **** - A great rock anthem to play loud at night - Has a steady rhythm, but tries two hard to be heavy<br />Rocket *** - ** - Kinda cheesy, really cheesy - Sounds like the theme to an 80's slasher film - pushing the vocals too much - not original enough<br />When Love & Hate Collide ** - * - ANOTHER Another great chorus and guitar solo, but NOT ORIGINAL, a mix between \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\" & \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" - Intro Screams Cliche<br />Armageddon It ***** - ***** - Can't sit still during it. YOU HAVE TO MOVE! - Good to listen to on your bedroom alone. In appreciation of the band, I give it 5 stars (I don't care if I sound bias)<br />Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad **** - *** - A great intro for Vivian joining the band - a good song, but I wouldn't intentionally listen to it<br />Rock of Ages ***** - ***** - One of many of the best rock anthems and jam songs in universal history - Humorous beginning lyrics - great guitar solo and immaculate vocals & lyrics <br />Hysteria ***** - ***1/2 - A great song to play to for any band - no comment<br />Miss You In A Heartbeat ** - ** - Kind of a good intro and chorus, but possibly their worst song - no comment<br />Bringin' On The Heartbreak ****1/2 - ****1/2 - Horrible intro lyrics, but GREAT anthemic chorus - very mellow and meloncholy<br />There's our review. The album's definitely worth buying. But, as many have said, \\"Hysteria\\" was overemphasized, and several tracks from Pyromania (primarily Rock! Rock! 'til You Drop), High 'n' Dry (mainly \\"Let It Go\\"), and Adrenalize (\\"White Lightning\\") were missing. A superb compilation of songs from one of the greatest bands. Goodbye now......\\"you won't ever have to say goodbye\\"................
B00000IQW3|5.0|An interesting little film of how a dead-end kid is forced to become a galactic hero, because of his facility at a computer game, which is a secret recruiting station for starfighter pilots. The computer-generated graphics, advanced for their time, now look ridiculously crude, but it somehow adds to the quaintness of the whole thing, with marvellous performances from Lance Guest as the reluctant hero, Robert Preston as the likeably roguish Centauri who is prepared not so much to bend the rules as to smash them into very tiny fragments and Dan O'Herily as Grigg, the lizard co-pilot whose dream is to go down fighting against impossible odds!
B00005JN1L|5.0|I am one of those who never pays attention to any critics review of a movie, after all, I'm not them, so how can they say whether they think I will like a movie?  I had started to read the story by Stephen King, but stopped part-way through to see the movie so I wouldn't ruin the ending.  I needn't have worried because the movie didn't end the same way. Check out the book, it's an additional treat. This movie has an excellent story, which is a writer, recently separated from the love of his live, battling writer's block and jealousy of the ex's new boyfriend, who is holed up all alone with only his dog and his thoughts in a remote summer house.  What he goes through is a wonderful story and a joy to watch, and Johnny Depp plays it perfectly!
B00005JLT5|5.0|This movie is an excellent war movie in a different way then you would expect. It is a war movie from a different perspective. <br />What happens to the main character is a perfect example of what can happen to a person who is on the sidelines of a war, someone who is not involved in the fighting but becomes very much involved in the horrors of what war can bring. The acting of Adrien Brody was superb. To pull off the part of going from a clean cut pianist in a higher class society to a sickly scavenger searching for food and water shows the skills and determination of being an excellent actor. <br />The cinematography was also outstanding. The realism of the Jewish holocaust is captured in a truthful yet disturbing way. This movie brought me to the times of Poland during WWII and I felt what it would be like to be there. That's what an excellent movie is all about.

B000003S0B|4.0|This is King Crimson's second album.  Others reviewers are correct in that some parts of this album sound too much like the first album.  Especially unoriginal is Pictures of A City.  Note that before it was put on this album, it was played live as A Man, A City.<br />But, this album is redeemed by some very good jazzy, instrumentals.  A lot of the music more mellow than anything King Crimson would ever do.  But it is still very innovative and invigorating.  <br />Note that the track Cat Food is not listed here, but I am sure that it is still on the CD.<br />King Crimson recorded one album (In the Court of the Crimson King), went on tour, and nearly fell apart.  Ian MacDonald, who was a co-leader of the group left.  So did Gred Lake, but he was brought back for this album to do vocal.  The Giles brothers were still with the band.<br />After this, Giles and MacDonald recorded an album called MacDonald and Giles.  It is better than In the Wake of Posieden and worth seeking out.  MacDonald went on to Foreigner, playing corporate rock and making tons of money.<br />MacDonald, the Giles, and a number of other old King Crimson members have recently got together to form a band called 21st Century Schizoid Band.  They have a couple of CD's out, with old King Crimson songs.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a fabulous classic anime film from Hayao Miyazaki, and I recommend it highly. However, if you're new to Miyazaki and anime in general I would recommend caution and an open mind as well. Unlike most American animated films, anime is an adult genre and this film is not for children. It is very violent (pushing an R rating, in my opinion) with a complex plotline, mythical references, and much that the kids just won't understand. There isn't the nudity often found in other anime - the absence of which seems to be a Miyazaki trademark - so that's a plus, but if you're looking for something suitable for children I would recommend some other Miyazaki films instead. For the youngest, the English language versions of &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; and &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot; are adorable. For those who enjoyed &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; I also highly recommend Miyazaki's adventure &quot;Castle in the Sky.&quot;
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Still coming on strong! Iron Maiden, the masters of epic song writing.  Dance of Death is further evidence of a band who's creativity supercedes the trends and fads of mainstream pop music.  This album brought me way back as though that dark period in the 1990's never existed.  Bruce's vocals were clear and tight.  Steves bass rolled over you like a tank.  Janick, Dave, and Adrian each trading solo's and rythyms was TNT leveling a wall of sound rendering you helpless as you wait for the smoke to clear. Nico thunders his kit insanely emulating the presence of mortar fire landing all around. We should all be grateful that this beloved band is still pounding out such ferocious music. As most other bands  fizzle out(in their first decade)  Maiden contiues to KILL us in their third!!<br />The weakest link, in my perspective, is the song &quot;Age of innocence&quot;.  It is different/ experimental. I commend the boys for going new directions. Reinventing your sound is crucial to self preservation.  However, as is clearly heard throughout the rest of the album, the old sound is still there and angry!!  &quot;Paschendale&quot; A+++  This song gave me the same feeling I had when I first heard &quot;Revelations&quot;. This album was so good that they incorporated much of it into their shows this past year and you could care less because they came at you like a machine!!!!  Until someone drops a beer on the soundboard...Way to go buddy...  <br />Buy this Album!!!
0385510438|4.0|John Grisham's \\"The Last Juror\\" is a great book and one of my Grisham favorites. <br />In \\"The Last Juror\\", we learn about living in a small southern town during the 1970's.  As we get to know the various characters in the story, many components of individual life, family life, community life, and small town life are revealed. It is through the owner of the local, weekly newspaper, and the newspaper itself that we learn of the town's many lives.  <br />The work ethic surrounding the local newspaper appears to be lax, but in spite of individual shortcomings, the job gets done. The editor, reporters, photographer, and others all do their part to get the paper out on time. One particularly interesting aspect of the paper is the importance and detail placed on the obituaries, a carry-over from the previous owner.<br />Murder happens in small towns, too, and this Mississippi newspaper covers the trial with ardent abandon. Among the jury members is one black, the first to ever serve here on a trial jury. You will enjoy knowing this juror, who, outside the trial, shares family, religion, friendship, input on segregation and integration, and much more. In fact, before the jury selection took place, readers of the newspaper were presented with a detailed, two-part biographical look at this person.<br />As serious as this story is, Grisham still manages to include humor throughout the book. Political events occur and are ones that make you wonder about \\"the system\\". The community, businesses, and individuals are faced with change that affects all these lives.
0689835604|5.0|\\"Where is Baby's Belly Button\\" is a perfect book for toddlers as long as you don't allow them to destroy the pages.  My 7 and 8 year old love \\"Drum, Chavi, Drum!\\" and read it to my toddler. For hours the three of them entertain themselves with this bilingual rhythmic book.  My twelve-year-old girl adores, \\"A Step From Heaven.\\"  I highly recommend these three books.<br />\\"Where is Baby's Belly Button\\" has adorable illustrations.  A must buy!
0679735909|4.0|\\"All of us have things in our lives which we know in such brief, usual way, and neglect deliberately to explore.\\" <br />The quote is redolent of the novel's essence. Roland Michell, a young scholar, was reading a bristled volume belonged to the late poet Randolph Henry Ash from which all the papers sprang out. He found two drafts of the beginning of a letter to a woman whom Roland identified later as Christobel LaMotte. Together with Professor Maud Bailey, who turned out to be a descendant of LaMotte, Roland unveiled, through bundles of correspondence letters between Ash and LaMotte, Ellen Ash's journal, and Blanche Glover's (LaMotte's lesbian partner) letters and a suicide note, the shocking romantic relationship between Ash and LaMotte. <br />What followed upon discovery of letters in Seal Court (where in a room of which Christobel LaMotte once resided) was one of the most ferocious wrangle about a correspondence between dead Victorian poets that Roland had just discovered. An American professor had offered huge sums for the manuscripts but the British were trying to have all the letters declared of national importance and forbade the export. As a matter of fact, these letters, journal entries and poems are entwined apropos with the prose as Byatt unfolds the story. The literary insertion is meant to accentuate the lives of the poets and their relationship - and readers should take to serious perusal and pay attention to the clues from which the scholars resolve the clandestine affair.<br />As the title implies, the story revolves around the multiple meanings of possession. Roland must have felt possessed to take the letters from the book into his possession. He even felt irritation at the privacy Maud assumed in the affair that began with the discovery of his purloined letters. Little did Roland know that his indefatigable pursuit of the letters had distanced him from the poet as the letters edged closer to the essence of his unknown private life. His finding had, in a sense, turned out to be a loss for him as a reader.<br />The book is beautifully written, intertwined with vestiges of the Victorian poets' lives, their musings and poems. Progression of the relationship between Roland and Maud is relatively subdued and insipid when measured against the vividly limned love life of the poets. The young scholars' relationship is executed with such stoicism that one might not surmise the slightest of passion. Possession is truly a literary fiction, or thriller, that is riddled with twisting intrigues.<br />2004 (13) © MY
B00005JLPK|5.0|a wondrous escapade of sound and vision...not to mention value (with the additional disc of extensive content). This film is a masterfully acted and well-produced embodiment of the life of an artist.<br />Hayek is convincing and gorgeous. The talent of acting by those around her empowers her to flesh out the story with great richness and life.
B00006GA4C|5.0|I could just throw out all the other Grand Funk albums and be happy with this one. Well... I might like to keep Closer to Home and their first live album also. This album is relatively primitive in the recording, but it has such balls, such life to it, and every song brings out fond memories of their heyday.<br />Don't even get me started on the direction they took when they added Craig Frost on keyboards and sophisticated their sound on their most well known work. To be fair, it is not Mr. Frost that was the problem, it was the Funk's overall sound and the songs that I didn't like. And what do you hear on the radio if a supposedly &quot;classic rock&quot; station even bothers to play any Grand Funk? American Band or Locomotion, of course. Bah humbug.<br />If you want rock at it's finest, and especially the finest moment of this great band, this may be the only album you'll ever need.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is one of those records that just leaves your jaw dropped in awe: awe that music could ever get this good again, and awe from realizing just how braindead the music world is to have overlooked them for so long.<BR>Popular music has been so insubstantial and rehashed for the last several years that a recording of this caliber is bound to create quite a stir. There is not one single bad song here: they are catchy without taking that fateful plunge over the \\"commercial\\" cliff; unlike what's popular, they have something to say in words actually beyond the high school level; and they are sung by a voice that we puny humans do not deserve to be exposed to.<BR>It doesn't hurt that Cristina Scabbia is the hottest piece of eye candy in music, but even if she wasn't her voice would still be the equivalent of an angelic choir. <BR>This album was released almost a year before it was really noticed by anyone. That's just sad. I have had this cd now for over a month and I STILL listen to it everyday. In fact I can't remember the last time I have been so absorbed in a recording. Probably never. All I know is that I this is the first cd I have purchased in years because it stands head and shoulders above everything else out there as far as quality and substance. <BR>It's scary to think that anything could be this good. How LC hasn't single-handedly run all of those cookie cutter corporate rock bands out of the business by now is mystifying. There is simply NO comparison. It appears that we have 2 choices these days: Lacuna Coil or fraudulent corporate music.
B000000OQF|5.0|Not enough people appreciate classic rock anymore.  Now we have all these crappy new bands that have no identity and no personality, Linkin Park, Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback, to name a few.  Whether you like GNR or not, you need to respect them because they were an amazing band that brought a lot to the music industry.  Bands like GNR, Led Zeppeline, AC/DC, Aerosmith and others will be remembered for years to come for their contributions and innovations to the industry.  This cannot be said for these half-a**ed poser wanna-be rock stars like LP, POM, and Nickelback, along with all the other wanna-be's out there
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I am not writing a full review on the set, but I love it and I think it is a great collection of movies.  Everyone who says that the discs do not work and say &quot;they own the top of the line DVD players&quot;, obviously don't have the top of the line DVD players.  I have two different DVD players, one new Sony that has progressive scan, and the other is an older Panasonic without progressive scan technology.  The discs freeze in the Panasonic DVD player, but not in the Sony one; this is because the Sony has progressive scan.  Also, the &quot;plastic cases with sharp edges&quot; do not scratch your DVDs unless you are incapable of putting the DVD in the case.  I have had no problems with the Alien Quadrilogy in my Sony DVD player and none of the discs were scratched when I opened the box. It is definitely worth the buy.  The movies are great.  I just didn't want any people to get misled, thinking that the set is total garbage and that the discs don't work.  Make sure you have a good DVD player.
B000000OQF|5.0|Soundgarden (also from Seattle) was the first grunge band, not Nirvana.  SOundgarden formed in 1983 and released their first EP in 1985.  Nirvana's Bleach, which was their first album, came out in 1987.  Not to take anything away from Nirvana, but Soundgarden really was the first group to do the grunge thing, Nirvana usually gets all the credit for it though.
B000000WZ4|1.0|when bands brake up, or there is a major line-up change, or creativity is exhausted, and the record company has you under contract, this is usually the type of material that gets put out.  the music on Ultra, though extremely polished, sounds like digital run of the mill alternative music, with the exception of David Gahan's voice, and Martin Gore's lyrics.  If you're a Depeche Mode fan, then this is your album, but if you're into Depeche Mode's more dance/industrial sound(Violator, Some Great Reward), stay completely away.  But if you're the traditional DM fan, and like the music for the lyrical content, then this is perfection.  Maybe Martin Gore should just stay away music, and just write poetry, and that's a real complement, he seems to have the ability to get his emotions to paper quite well.
0743243307|5.0|This is a highly intelligent novel with writing so evocative (and I'm not just talking about the cooking-with-spices and colourful-laundry stuff)that you know no movie of the week or Hollywood effort could ever do justice to it.  The story is about Nazneen's life as a young Bangladeshi bride brought to London and her growing realization that she can manipulate &quot;fate&quot;.  Her husband is a silly buffoon who the reader at first despises but eventually feels some fondness for.  Nazneen protests her unpleasant situation silently; for example, she refuses to eat in front of her husband.  She eats out of Tupperware containers during the night standing over the sink.  At one point she equally despises and pities her husband,simultaneously feeling like &quot;going to him and stroking his head ....and getting up from the table and walking out of the door and never seeing him again.&quot;  Familiar feelings anyone?   My only complaint about this excellent book is the device of conveying Nazeen's sister's thoughts through letters from Bangladesh. They hardly ring true.  Why couldn't Hasina's (the sister) version be told, like Nazneen's, in the third person?  Her letters are a silly combination of Bengali-English and incredible insight conveyed with what is meant to be naivete. They don't work.  However, this is the book's only flaw.  The story is fascinating, rolls along at a good pace, is very, very funny and very, very tragic.  It is a story that is rich in detail yet every word, in English or Bengali, is necessary.  When you have finished reading it you feel enriched, educated, chastened, entertained, and hungry for more books by Monica Ali.
B000008MLS|5.0|The debate seems to be centered on which of Frank Zappa's albums is the best and the choice is between &quot;Apostrophe&quot; and &quot;Over-nite Sensation.&quot;  But such a debate is moot if you put the two albums on one CD, right?  Besides, these albums run a bit short on their own, so putting them together makes sense on that economic level as well.<br />&quot;Apostrophe,&quot; in its own words, &quot;is an album of songs and stories set to music performed for your dining and dancing pleasure.&quot; The first four songs are about an Eskimo that almost makes sense, which makes this something of an actual concept album, at least for the first &quot;side&quot; of the record. What I remember is that &quot;Don't Eat the Yellow Snow&quot; was my first exposure to the musical stylings of Frank Zappa (my roommate did the &quot;listen to this&quot; bit with me). The best guitar solos are on &quot;Cosmik Debris,&quot; &quot;Stink-Foot,&quot; and the title cut. The lyrics are perhaps a dark shade of Zappa than you usually find, but it was 1974 and that could explain it right there since you should look for deep, hidden meanings in the songs of Frank Zappa, but just not in any conventional way.<br />Now, the reason I have this album can easily be explained by quoting the chorus of the first track, &quot;Camarillo Brillo&quot;:<br /><br />She had a snake for a pet<br />And an amulet<br />And she was breeding a dwarf<br />But she wasn't done yet<br />She had gray-green skin<br />A doll with a pin<br />I told her she was awright<br />But I couldn't come in<br />(actually, I was very busy then).<br />The lyrics are what hooked me, but I also like the way George Duke pounds the ivories during that song. Along with &quot;I'm the Slime&quot; and &quot;Dirty Love&quot; I think that the first three tracks on &quot;Overnite Sensation&quot; distill the Zappa essence as well as any comparable set you can find in his entire oeuvre. Perhaps the best proof of this would the anecdotal evidence that this is the album people who only own one Frank Zappa album happen to own. This would make sense since &quot;Overnite Sensation&quot; is probably more rock-oriented than most of Zappa's albums. For songs about in a similar vein, only about an Eskimo, check out &quot;Apostrophe,&quot; which was produced in the same time with pretty much the same musicians.the album people who only own one Frank Zappa album happen to own.

0385504209|1.0|I am an MA Theology &amp; Philosophy Graduate  well-acquainted with art and ecclesiastical history, literature and theology. The plot is foolish, it is weak and contrived, and the characters are cartoons. The person who said this topic was well researched has studied history about as poorly as the Author. 'research' done in preparation for writing this book could've been better accomplished though Classics Comics. Theological inconsistencies abound, such as a root question: why might such a preposterous ruse ever have been initiated in the first place? I noted that Brown refers to Leonardo as 'DaVinci,' a nomenclature never used by art historians, who refer to him as 'Leonardo.' The representation of Opus Dei was patently fabricated ab ovo, bearing no relation to the real entity; this is the case whether one loves or loathes the prelature in question. As is also the case with his other work, Brown is at it again making a fast dollar from a gullible and uncultivated public. The reason this book is popular is because a media and industry hostile to Catholicism like to distort, enlarge, and lie about the faith, and this book is one after their own hearts.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Indie-rock band At the Drive In shattered just as they were starting to make it big. But from the ashes of At The Drive-In came: The Mars Volta. And their full-length debut album, &quot;De-Loused At The Comatorium,&quot; is a rousing, blasting, strange and magnificent lump of space rock.<br />&quot;Son Et Lumiere&quot; is a melodic buildup to the fireball of &quot;Inertiatic ESP,&quot; the eerie string-driven &quot;Tira Me A Las Aranas,&quot; the haunting drum-laden &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot; with its lamenting howls, the rollicking &quot;Eriatarka,&quot; the slightly overlong but very compelling &quot;Cicatriz ESP,&quot; the chaotic &quot;This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed,&quot; the soft and melodic &quot;Televators,&quot; and the At the Drive-In-influenced &quot;Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt.&quot;<br />It's rather rare to have a concept album now. But this full-length debut definitely is one. It tells of a Mexican artist who committed suicide in the 1990s. Here, he falls into a coma and lingers in the world of &quot;De-Loused&quot; for a week. (It sounds depressing, but it isn't) The plaintive, surreal songs make a lot more sense once you know the story.<br />&quot;De-Loused&quot;'s sound is hard to classify: a combo of rock, psychedelica, a hint of jazz, Latin music, and a few others that are hard to identify. For that matter, it's not really much like several songs, as a single song that bobs into different musical genres. Often the songs will melt into one another, one barely pausing as it dies away before the next melody starts. It gives &quot;De-Loused&quot; the feeling of a big, glorious tapestry.<br />The lyrics and music reflect this feel; the lyrics are wrenchingly weird (&quot;Nobody is heard/compass wilting in the wind!&quot;), with an undeniably powerful melancholy, dark edge. It's never more evident than in the despairing wail of &quot;Now I'm lost!&quot;. The music can switch from shattering guitar riffs to delicate instrumentals tinged with a synthesizer.

B0000634EV|4.0|This IS Down: Part Deux. This is NOT &quot;Nola&quot; 2nd edition. Personally the major hook that had me up and buying this CD was the simple fact that it is not a sonic redundancy. This is a NEW and DIFFERENT album written and recorded 7 years after thier debut. If after 7 years the boys pumped out &quot;Nola Version 2.0&quot; I'd laugh and throw away the artists respective albums. This is new, it's fresh and doesn't sound like anything else I've come across. No longer does the band mimic the respective peices that make up the whole, now what I hear is the peices coming together to represent the vision as a whole. Regardless of what drugs they're smoking, shooting or snorting this band is an original collective. In the overpopulating world of metal/rock supergroups/side projects this one is a keeper. <br />One reviewer commented that any piece of music that was recorded in 60 days was bound to be terrible. No, see here kid... I don't have enough space in this review to list all the great bands in metal and rock who've busted out classic albums in half that time or less. Let's just say... Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Nirvana. Also, remind yourself that they had 7 years to stew (before recording) plenty of time to write and jam these songs.<br />It's not the drugs the artist does that makes them great. Some people are more comfortable expressing themselves within the confines of addiction. A sad state if you're a dumb kid with no talent. Drug-addled lifestyle is more acceptable if you're accomplished as an artist. On another wavelength... Who gives a rats ass who does what drugs. If you care so much, write a tabloid of junky metal artists... It'd read a mile long and then some. Gossip and speculation for fools with no lives of thier own.<br />NOTE: Do not buy this album if you <BR>A.)Don't get high <BR>B.)Can't headbang <BR>C.)Hate 70's/90's hard rock/metal.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is a beautiful CD that's perfect enough for five stars.  It's not as great as &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, but it achieves its own greatness in its precise manipulation of mood.  The title, &quot;Parachutes&quot;, is perfect for its breezy feel, while the hit single, &quot;Yellow&quot;, sounds just like the color would sound if it were a song.  This CD is just one example of Coldplay's untouchable genius.

B000063JDE|5.0|I just recently saw this film but there have been years where people have talked about it, referenced it in conversation but I haven't seen until recently and I can say that it's a film that's had me focusing on Lynch's style of directing. This is the second Lynch film that I've seen. I saw DUNE which he wouldn't even lend his name too. In comparing both films, I would say that both seem to have a dark taint to them. Well this film had an overthetop performance by Dennis Hopper as Frank Booth, the film actually became more interesting with his performance. The surreal scene at the bordello was the highlight of the movie.
B000005JA8|1.0|Careful, there!  You almost stepped on something terrible!  The beach is usually beautiful, but you can get hurt if you just go off anywhere without looking first.  They should have put some buoys around this lurking monster.  Better luck next time!
B0000CFW87|5.0|If you haven't heard of Josh Groban, then this is the perfect time. \\"Closer\\" is a wonderful place to start. It's a great introduction to a new type of pop music by someone with a classically trained voice. It has a different sound, but it's refreshing. If you have an open mind then this will be a rewarding experience.<br />I once thought that pop music had to be a collection of catchy slick tunes, just as I thought a staircase's purpose was to only serve my feet. But architecture school changed the latter view. I now know that a staircase can stand alone as its own piece of architecture. But I had to see it in photos and do a staircase project in school in order to believe it. I never would have thought otherwise. It's the same with Josh's music and voice. If you've never listened to it in its entirety, then it's easy to form a sour opinion. If you play his CD only willing to accept Justin Timberlake as the outcome, then it will be a great disappointment. \\"Closer\\" does represent contemporary pop music, just not in the form that most are used to. But it's no less valid because it's in a different package or contains an unfamiliar sound.<br />I traditionally buy R&amp;B first, but that doesn't mean that those CDs are the favorites in my collection. It doesn't guarantee a particular status over another style or genre. I watch MTV all the time, and I have Justin Timberlake's CD. Therefore, I am capable of liking his interpretation of pop music and Josh's. I'm glad there are recording artists willing to take us down a more traditional path, and others that will take us on a journey that we never expected.<br />Architecture school freed my mind and so has Josh's music. Even though I have altered my career path, the experience was priceless. Once you listen to Josh, your universe will never be the same shape again.
B0000DCGT5|3.0|One of the things the producers behind 'American Pie 2' were proud of was that most of the cast (and all of the major players) of the first movie returned. Unfortunately, this was not the case here. Oz (Chris Klein), which was an integral part of the group in the first two movies, isn't even mentioned in 'American Wedding'. An actor's absemce (whether it's due to his unwillingness to rejoin the franchise or any other reason) is understandable. And since Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kay Thomas) had so little to do, Oz's absence was a blessing in a way. But a mention of him and his whereabouts would have made much more sense than completely erasing him from the American Pie 'mythology', hoping we (the viewers) won't notice.<br />While Finch &amp; Kevin fade into the background, Stifler (Seann William Scott) gets a much bigger part than ever before. He's still an obnoxious girl chaser, who didn't seem to outgrow his highschool juvenile - jock personna, up until the end of the movie.<br />Besides the big change in the group dynamics, this movie (unlike 'Pie 2') takes a big turn story wise. Jim, Michelle, and their wedding are now the center of the movie, instead of the group's friendship &amp; dynamics. We don't get to see the 'stories' of Kevin or Finch, for instance, develop any further, or hear a word about their current relationships (besides the inevitable encounter with Stifler's Mom).<br />The laughs, though, are still there. They still are, or course, immature and pretty coarse, but by now, this is wat is expected of the 'American Pie' series.
0743224345|1.0|... and nothing else unfortunately. <BR>The theory is insufficient.<BR>The strategies aren't better than regular and are chaotically presented throughout the book.<BR>The questions are not that though unless they are just written badly.<br />On the other side it has a nice foreword and an ambitious title, so I was stupid enough to buy it as I hadn't seen the reviews. No more Kaplan for me EVER.
B00013F38K|1.0|The sad truth is Bruce Lee DID conceive of Kung Fu with the producer of Green Hornet. Lee would have been PERFECT for the role of Cain. Who is to say Bruce Lee would not have made a perfect priest? Every scene would not have had to be all out action packed?! He knew how to meditate, and yet had the fastest, most accurate moves ever witnessed. There was no equal. Perhaps that's why Mr. Carradine is so quick to justify why Bruce was not right for the part and he was ever so humble and perfect.<br />Or could it be that David Carradine is rather justifying his &quot;humble&quot; inferiority to the true master since he knows he can never measure up either to Master Lee's martial arts skills, or his on-screen persona.<br />In the words of another reviewer:<BR>As David Carradine himself said in the foreword to, The Kung Fu Book of Caine (a detailed book that looks into the series and each episode by Herbie J. Pilato), &quot;Our basic concerns to make this show what it was were absolute authenticity, historical accuracy, the chronicling of the troubles the Chinese immigrants experienced in America, a hint of the need for social revolution, lots of Chinese philosophy, caring for all life, a lot of heart, and superior technical quality in the films, in the writing and in our execution of all this. Somewhere right in the center was this character, 'KWAI CHANG CAIN' or 'LITTLE GRASSHOPPER' who bound it all together. It was his sweetness and his strength and the special kind of humor that went with him that kept people tuning in every week.&quot;<br />Well, I'm sure he really believed that!! <BR>REALITY CHECK#1: Absolute authenticity would be his own heritage in question. There were no &quot;half-Chinese&quot; priests roaming the countryside. <BR>REALITY CHECK #2: Historical accuracy concerning the Chinese, a hint of the need for social revolution, the chronicling of the troubles the Chinese immigrants experienced in America.<BR>Is he referring to racism? Now this gets really muddy since it crosses into the 1870s racism into the 1970s version of racism now in the 2004s racism back to the DVD 1970s' version of the 1870s racism. Did you all follow that? Good. That is essentially what you're looking at, and that's not real history.<BR>REALITY CHECK #3: Lots of Chinese philosophy, caring for all life, a lot of heart. <BR>Chinese philosophy, such as \\"snatch the pebble from my hand?\\" Or, did that one come from a little known fortune cookie? True, the caring and heart was/is a great kudo and there were many attributes from Chinese philosophy brought into the show.<BR>REALITY CHECK #4: 'KWAI CHANG CAIN' or 'LITTLE GRASSHOPPER', a.k.a. David Carradine, a.k.a. 'KWAI CHANG CAIN' or 'LITTLE GRASSHOPPER'. Once the show ended, Carradine \\"lost\\" himself and began using opium. He was arrested trying to save a woman from her own husband by using his Kung Fu on him. [He saved her because she was his opium connection, plus, he was high.] His reality set in and he just couldn't face it: He couldn't act and was mediocre at martial arts.  He knows Bruce Lee is gone, but is more popular in death than he had been in life. Face it Carradine, you were never meant for the part and every part you've had since you've tried to be KWAI CHANG CAIN and failed. Snatch a pebble from MY hand!
B00006879E|4.0|&quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is rather an unique collection of music.  Listening to the different songs you feel as if there are numerous influences behind this CD.  Sometimes the lead singer reminds me of Sting with his wonderful voice, and sometimes the music gives me the impression of jazz, other times rock-n-roll.  With such a myriad of songs and each one is distinctly different, one can not put this CD in a music style category.  That is the great thing about it.<br />It is original, easy to listen to and easy to appreciate.  You can tell this band has got a talent that not many can capture.  I liked some of the songs, not all of them.  I imagine it would take getting used to.  Great CD.<br />Joy.
B000002G6J|5.0|I just received this album, today, and I can't get enough of it! I had sampled listening to the tracks after being attracted to \\"Wave\\"'s unique album cover with the giraffe silhouetted in a 'green sky' background. (The picture on the back with Tom Jobim in silhouette is also nice, adding a haunting, dramatic touch.) I immediately fell in love with this album, and had to order it.      All of the tracks on Tom Jobim's \\"Wave\\" are bossa novas - bossa nova being my favorite style of Brazilian music. One can't help imagine being on a Rio de Janeiro beach while listening to the tracks \\"Wave\\", \\"The Red Blouse\\", \\"Look To the Sky\\" (with its wistful, dreamy quality). For \\"Batidinha\\", the music is so breezy! When I listen to it, I like to envision a relaxed, lazy day on the beach (again, in Rio).       The rhythmic \\"Mojave\\" sounds like an upbeat waltz. But it is too short. Just as you are beginning to enjoy it, the song is finished!       And, finally, there is my ultimate favorite track, \\"Antigua\\". This should have been the last song on the album (In this case, I play the last track, \\"Captain Bacardi\\", first; then I conclude with \\"Antigua\\").    When I listen to \\"Antigua\\" (at least, just this version), whimsical person that I am, I imagine Alexander Belayev's \\"Amphibian\\" Ichthyander romancing his sweetheart, Gutierre on an isolated beach on that Caribbean island. I see them tenderly embracing (and kissing!) at the surf.       Okay, back to reality, and Tom Jobim's \\"Wave\\"!      I sampled the tracks on \\"Tide\\", Jobim's follow-up album to \\"Wave\\". \\"Tide\\" is good, but many of the songs veer from the bossa nova sound. Which is why I'm sticking with \\"Wave\\". An Amazon reviewer mentioned that \\"Wave\\" is the better of the two albums. I agree. For me, it is THE BEST! Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Wave\\" is a must-have for lovers of standard bossa nova music, and for lovers, in general.
B00005JMCN|4.0|There are two things that I can recommend about &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;: superb acting from the stars including Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, and William H Macy -- and the realistic horse race scenes.  The story is too long (one too many episode), the development is too conventional, but the film has managed to give us the message about life -- you have a second chance of life.  For that only, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; deserves viewing.<br />The story is based on the book by Laura Hillenbrand, who unearthed a once forgotten horse &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; whose legend gave the hope to live in the Depression era in America.  The horse was not big; it did not belong to the prestigious family line of any famouse horses; and it won the big game against the odds.  How could people, living in the hard times, miss the heroic figure?<br />And also enters the jokey with no name, Johnny &quot;Red&quot; Pollard (Maguire), who lost sight in one eye, and struggling in the local race where no rule is the rule (see the incredible &quot;race&quot; in which you can do anything).  But when &quot;Red&quot; was found by a kind-hearted employer Charles Howard (Bridges), and the veteran trainer Tom Smith (Cooper) joins the team, everything is in a fit place to make an American legend.  Yes, this is a story that could happen only in America, and I mean that is a great thing.<br />The actors are, as I said, all great.  Tobey Maguire is in a fit form to play the jockey, who must have underwent a hard training.  Underrated Jeff Bridges never pushes himself forward (that's why his four-time Oscar nonimations, and no win), but in this case, appropriately so, for he plays the ever-understanding psuedo-father figure to the boy, reckless &quot;Red.&quot;  And you get Chris Cooper, cameleon actor of new generation, whose presence as the tough-and-rough veteran should be praised for giving the touch of humainity to the story.<br />The direction by Gary Ross is far from natural. I am afraid.The film goes more than 140 minutes (which is too long), and his way of handling of some scenes should be called 'tampering' instead of editing (I remember he was behind the camera in &quot;Pleasantville&quot; which was too artificial to me).  Still,  you will get the energy and good, old, straightforwardness when William H Macy appears as radio announcer.  His racy turn here is just a joy to see.<br />All in all, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is a successful film, especially when we know it is based on the truth -- the truth upgraded by excellent acting of the talented actors, and the great production designs re-producing America in the 1930s.  And do not miss the hair-raising horse race scenes, which enables you to share the viewpoints of the jockeys.  Now that is precious, indeed.
B00005JL3A|5.0|so to everyone that thinks its cheep and tacky and very unbeliveable you hav to loosen up, you people when u go to the movies look for the imperfrections have an amagination it will help and just think to ur self for like 1 min that what if it did happen, i know, it maybe stupid, but with the rate at which technology is moveing along these days i wouldn't put it past anyone!! i think that all the charters were casted exelently well and they all suited the roles!!

B00012QM8G|1.0|Putting a five-star film in a minus five-star flipper format with inadequate packaging sends me the message that Universal has done all it can do to ensure that we scratch up this DVD enough, or that it gets dust-laden enough, that we are forced to rebuy down the road. My suspicion is that someone has some wondrous &quot;new&quot; format (like a sensible two-disk set in a keeper case) waiting in the wings, ready to (not) dazzle those of us who bought the film in its initial DVD release. The present format has resulted in a greatly disappointed audience, and as an earlier reviewer suggested, Universal should at least offer free keeper cases with title insert for those of us who prefer to keep our DVDs in good, clean condition so that we do NOT have to rebuy them down the road. (As a matter of note, the copy of SL that I bought was actually loaded with dust and, somehow, marked with fingerprints when I opened it! As I had been so eager for this purchase, I bought that copy at a local store, and fortunately was able to get an exchange.)
B00005JLH3|4.0|This film is perfect for fans of marching bands, Drum Corps International (DCI) and especially fans of drumlines. The storyline is predictable, of course: young, cocky upstart (Nick Cannon as Devon) challenges everyone around him, including his section leader Sean(Leonard Roberts) and the band director (Orlando Roberts), but the performances by Cannon and Roberts are convincing enough to keep the film entertaining. Cannon, in particular, has just the right touch of intensity for the film. Zoe Saldana is lovely as Laila, but she does not get to show her chops much as a peripheral character to the action. Orlando Brown does not fully get to show off his charisma. The key pieces, however, are the band performances (played by the real bands of Morris Brown College, Clark Atlanta University, Bethune-Cookman College, and Grambling State), the highlights without question being the drum breaks. Drumline is not one of those emotionally \\"deep\\" films, but it is highly entertaining: in the tradition of movies like Hoosiers and Rudy. The face off at the film's end between two drumlines for the fictional Big South Classic itself is worth the price of the film.
B0001611DI|5.0|Whether the upcoming remake is any good or not doesn't matter; George Romero's 1979 follow up to the legendary Night of the Living Dead can still dish out the chills nearly 25 years after it's initial release.  We all know the story by now: four people barricade themselves inside a shopping mall while hordes of the undead hungrily try to claw their way inside.  Dawn of the Dead is nothing short of epic with great, taut performances and Tom Savini's landmark gut ripping gore effects, plus the satirical stab at consumer culture that made the film a hit with critics.  The film still manages to be shocking to this day, and it has aged quite gracefully.  Anchor Bay finally decided to re-release Dawn of the Dead on DVD, and it features a fantastic commentary by Romero, Savini, and crew.  Other than that, the extras are a bit lacking, even though a deluxe edition is supposedly due out later this year.  All in all, if you've ever called yourself a horror fan, than Dawn of the Dead deserves a place in your film library.
0316921173|5.0|The working title of this book, from what I've read on various Wallace-related sites, was &quot;Infinite Jest: A Failed Entertainment&quot;, but the publisher didn't want that on the front of a huge book, for understandable reason.
B00015HVI8|5.0|People new to Stargate fandom often have the unfortunate view that everyone who watched Season 6 hated it because Daniel wasn't there. Therefore it doesn't even get given the chance, simply because the actor *chose* to leave the show.<br />The opinion of Season 6 minus Daniel = Horrible is only that of a very vocal minority. Don't let it put you off watching this amazing season.<br />Season 6 is very different in tone, storyline and effects. But it's in no way any less wonderful. <br />The actors have a peppiness that makes you realise how much they love their job. Richard, Amanda, Chris, Don and Teryl light up the screen, and Corin Nemec brings a refreshing and very welcome change.<br />Storylines are (for the most part) intriguing, interesting and gripping.<br />And the effects? Just wow.<br />I'd reccomend this season to fans old and new, young and old. Let the best Sci Fi show on TV draw you in like it has so many others. Spread the love of the show, for it's still not getting the recognition it deserves.
B000001EL3|5.0|Destroyer is by many fans rated as their best studio effort. <BR>This was the album where Kiss had to prove that they were more than a live spectacle, and show their best songs. And they did just that.<BR>1. Detroit Rock City - One Kiss' most celebrated songs. High energy. Great guitars, drums &amp; vocals. This was the song that showed straight away that Kiss could come up with some amazing stuff. It has almost never left the setlist since.<BR>2. King Of The Night Time World - Follows DRC like a brother. Criss' galloping drums is a real treat here. There's nothing like this track to get the blood pumping.<BR>3. God Of Thunder - Gene's showcase number. Dark &amp; eerie with one great riff after another. Stanley wrote it. This was a type of song that really hadn't been explored by Kiss before. Heavy indeed.<BR>4. Great Expectations - A laid back beautiful song by Simmons.<BR>Has a part from some classical number. Not a typical Kiss song, but surely just as good.<BR>5. Flaming Youth - Anthem rocker. Didn't quite work out as a classic the way Kiss had hoped, but fits the album well. One of the few forgotten diamonds  from this album.<BR>6. Sweet Pain - The only song off the album which hasn't been played in concert. Very cool drum rhythm, and chorus. I like it.<BR>7. Shout It Out Loud - This was The anthem here. Gene &amp; Paul trading vocals with a chorus you'll never forget. Rock'n Roll.<BR>8. Beth - Criss' classic ballad took everybody by surprise, even the band. This was the song that made this album a chart success and put Kiss in the big league. Good song, but I still think it's the weakest on the album.<BR>9. Do You Love Me - I love this one. No song so simple should be this cool. Resurrected for the reunion tour in 96, and have become a standard. Great version on this album.<br />This album is a safe bet. No weak songs. Cool productions. Great playing. Essential.
0739313118|3.0|I found the book entertaining to a point.  However, &quot;the historical accuracy&quot; is severly in question.<br />This is a different mystery novel.  In order to enjoy this book, you must let reason fall by the wayside.  If you can't do that, this book would fail miserably.<br />The storyline, while interesting is not realistic.  The anti-heros, namely the Catholic Church, are portrayed in the worst  possible light.<br />The author has worked a very dry subject into an interesting storyline.
B00003Q43A|2.0|This is a pretty simple flim to sum up, to wit: it is dumb and loud.  Its appeal is pretty limited, and it really isn't worth owning unless you are just looking for ways to burn up money.  It isn't a horrible film like Starship Troopers, but is just a mediocre popcorn flick.  I like action and sci-fi movies, but Independence Day is just not that good.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I loved this film in the theaters and was looking forward to getting the DVD... and the DVD's great except one thing, the ads at the beginning. Focus Features/Universal decided to not allow viewers to skip past the previews and forces you to either sit through several long ads or fast-forward through them. DVD's were created so you don't have to fast-forward through stuff anymore! One might as well buy the VHS copy. I hope the user-unfriendliness is removed in future printings of this DVD.
0790732203|5.0|One of the better teenage movies of the 1980's. What impressed me most is the story is so real & probably a part of everyone's lives. Tom Cruise is an innocent teenager, who is forced by his friends to take advantage of his parents' absence from home & invites a call-girl over. What starts off as an interesting night for Cruise slowly turns into a nightmare. He runs his Dad's priceless Porsche into Lake Michigan by carelessness, gets suspended from college & gets very close to a real-life debt situation ! Rest of the film is seen Cruise straightening his life along with little or no help from his buddies. The film often highlites the phrase - What the heck ? Take some chances in life....Be a future enterpriser, signalling the need to use every given opportunity that life offers into a money making investment. Joe Pantoliano shines as Guido the killer pimp. Kurt Masur also excels as the bewildered school correspondent who comes to interview Cruise. The film scores in almost all departments - Editing, Screenplay, Direction & an excellent score by Tangerine Dream. They provide a very haunting score titled ''Love on a Real Train, wherein we see Tom Cruise making love to Rebecca De Mornay in Chicago's EL train late @ nite when none is aboard the train. The producers could re-release the film with a 5.1 DD soundtrack that could certainly enhance the film's outlook even more.
B00005JLSE|4.0|This really isnt a review just my own comments.  I fell in love with Renee when I saw Bridget Jones' Diary.  When Chicago came out even though Renee stars in it, I never saw it until about Feb. of 2004.  I really not a big fan of musicals.  I decided to give it a chance and boy am I glad I did.  Renee was wonderfull.  so was Richard Gere.  After Zeta-Jones won her oscar for Chicago as Best supporting actress all the comments of her not wanting to really acknowledge Renee and giving her the cold shoulder.  I was pretty mad.  When I saw this movie I saw that yes Catherine could sing and act very well.  However observing the two of them dancing together. I saw that Renee was definatly the better dancer.  Catherine looked like she was doing the 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 steps all girls go through when learning a routine for cheerleading. She had no natural talent and charisma for dance. However Renee was the better dancer by far. She wasnt just going through the motions she had talent,great rythm and stole the show. Way to go Renee!!!!! When she won her Oscar for cold mountain I said its about time!! This great actress has nowhere to go but straight to the top!! I will always look for her in new movies and remain a devoted fan!!!!!!
B00005JMFQ|3.0|Let me begin by saying that there are some great actors appearing in this. Maybe that in itself is part of the problem!!! I mean Colin Firth and a love interest would have been sufficient, just as Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson would have been. I know that the director, Richard Curtis, wanted to show the complexities and subtleties of love and he needed a large canvas to do this, but really, this is too much. The mix and mash of stories does pull on the heart strings on occasion but there are too many pieces and the plot is disjointed as a result!!! It also requires that you suspend your disbelief, BIG TIME. I mean some of the situations (Hugh's prime minister and his plot) are just too over the top to be anything other than nauseatingly sweet!!! I was persuaded to go and see this by my girlfriend,( she had seen it once already!!!) and was hoping for a great , modern British comedy, along the lines of BJD. Alas this falls far short of the mark!!  Numerous subplots are also left unresolved and there seems to a lot missing, unexplainably!!! All in all, I suppose it is worth sitting through just once, but I wouldn't want this near my DVD collection. There are far better and more intelligent comedies out there!!!! This is just too sweet, too coy, too immature and too naive.
