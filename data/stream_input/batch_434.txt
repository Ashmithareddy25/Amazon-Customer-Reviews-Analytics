B000002HPV|5.0|There are selections on this album that transcend her previous material in everyway . . . \\"Hunter/Joga/Unravel/Bachelorette\\" - Merge together to form the first part of Homogenic. (\\"Unravel\\" still gets me right there) -if ya know what I mean ;)  This album starts off with 4 excellent 5 STAR tunes and threatens us throughout with delirious supernatural perfection. <br /> <br />\\"All Neon Like\\" -Stands terrifically on it's own. <br /> <br />\\"5 Years/Immature\\" -A 2-part song sugued together. <br /> <br />\\"Alarm Call\\" -The best of the singles... <br /> <br />\\"Pluto\\" -Animated-Kinetic Crackle & Buzz <br /> <br />\\"All is Full of Love\\" -Much slower and works a lil' better on the CD single,  but, whatever. <br /> <br />There are not many voices more beautiful than her's!  I WILL wear this CD out listening to it!!!!!!!
0743454529|3.0|I read this book in two days - It moves quickly and held my interest.  However it was the ultimate Lifetime Movie.  Cheesy and far-fetched.  I wish I'd known that going into it!
B00006879E|2.0|Combine bad pop-rock with some funk riffs, and wow! You have Maroon 5. And yes, I have heard this record in total. After \\"She Will Be Loved\\" (which, by the way, is boyband revival in its worst form), the record loses all sense of eclecticism (about 3 of the songs use the same riffs, just with a minor chord change or two), until you get to \\"Sunday Morning\\", which rips off Incubus' \\"Summer Romance\\" so badly it makes me sick. Save for a Radiohead-ish \\"Through With You\\", it's just not worth it. Please, go buy Pavement's \\"Crooked Rain Crooked Rain\\" if you like alt. rock, and go buy anything by Galactic if you like the funk aspect of it.
B0002IU988|5.0|I thought Creed was some of the best music I'd ever heard, until I popped this cd in! Mark Tremonti (guitar) has greatly improved and solos on nearly every song, Scott Philips is great (as usual!) on drums, and Myles Kennedy (vocals) has a very powerful voice. Their single \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is a bit of a preview of how the album is, but Alter Bridge is as diverse as Creed was- each song is very different. I would recommend this cd to any rock fan! If you liked Creed at all, One Day Remains is a must.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I must confess, I am disappointed that the original, untouched versions of these films will not be released on DVD.  They're the films I grew up on, not the retouched versions. <br /> <br />Why couldn't George Lucas do what his buddy Steven Speilberg did with E.T.?  My E.T. DVD set has two discs, one with the original, one with the retouched, and there's actually a third version if you count the one that has an alternate soundtrack of a live orchestra playing the music. <br /> <br />Why not satisfy both audiences?  I liked some of the retouched bits (like reinserting Han talking to Jabba the Skinny Hutt in A New Hope--it went far in explaining who the heck Jabba was in Return of the Jedi), but I still want to see the untouched originals in DVD. <br /> <br />Five stars for being the classics they are, but -1 star for not giving us the option to see BOTH versions of the films.
B00005JM20|3.0|There's not much to say about \\"Johnny English\\" except that it's a reasonably funny film with good acting.  Rowan Atkinson plays Mr. English with less-than-expected buffoonish flair.  I really was hoping that he would bust into one of Mr. Bean's signature screw-ups, but Bean this ain't, so don't expect too much slapstick.  Natalie Imbruglia is lovely as ever, and provides a solid performance as an Interpol agent who helps out English.  Ben Miller is a standout as English's straight-laced sidekick.  He's Watson to English's Sherlock Holmes.  John Malkovich gives an uninspired performance as Pascal Sauvage, who's after the crown.<br /><br />The film rolls around for about an hour and a half until we get to a big climax that's funny, but leaves you wanting more.  In fact, the entire film plays this way.  You always feel as if every scene could be just a little bit funnier, but for some odd reason, it isn't.<br /><br />Others have stated that this film tries to be \\"Austin Powers,\\" but I disagree.  Granted, it is a spy-spoof, but it isn't as blatantly silly as \\"Powers.\\"  It actually comes across to me as an attempt to be a somewhat intelligent, yet dry, spoof of the \\"Bond\\" flicks with a little Inspector Clouseau thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a horrible movie.  When it's smart, it's very smart, and the antics of Atkinson are always fun to watch.  However, the movie is just a little too slow and a little too \\"blah\\" to be considered more than a rental.  If you really love Atkinson, as I do, you'll probably want this for your collection.  Other than that, just rent this flick.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I agree with the review below mine, but it doesn't stop these movies being great. But these are like the Lord of the Rings in that they can't be watched over and over. Why? Because they're action movies with little comic relief (Han Solo) and you can only enjoy seing a Tie fighter blow up a couple of times. None the less, to the sensible people who only watch these movies once every 10-15 years these are classic exiting adventures. <br /> However, in all honesty, unless you really desperately want to see the special features, or don't have these movies already, keep the ones you have and treasure them-this edition isn't worth it. I've got the original vidio release versions, and have only watched them twice and love them. <br /> Essentially, it's just another version of a great film, but due to the fact that it doesn't stand to repeated watching, I give this a four star. <br /> I hope I've been of use... Toodle Pipskie (is that how you spell it?)
B000006NPY|4.0|This cd is very well done. It is the most lyrically, and artistically driven SP album, although Corgan doesn't even consider it a Pumpkins' album. I wouldn't either. <br /> <br />After listening to it, you'll know what I mean. This cd is not self-indulgent. This is a cd about heartbreak. For some people, this could be a very very painful listen, if you've just been through a breakup yourself. It will bring tears, I guarantee it. For everyone else, you'll consider it probably one of the saddest cds you'll ever hear. \\"Behold! The Night Mare\\", \\"For Martha\\" and \\"Blank Page\\" ensure this, these tracks alone are enough to make the most upbeat album depressing. \\"For Martha\\" is the saddest song I've ever heard. <br /> <br />This doesn't get 5 stars because it's just not something you can enjoy, where Mellon Collie and Siamese Dream were great to listen to, this makes you manic depressive. <br /> <br />
B000001GBJ|3.0|The CD is pretty good for it's kind. It's soothing, tranquil, peaceful and calming, but I prefer vocals myself (I'm a huge Loreena McKennitt fan) so I was hoping for more the first time I listened to it.<br /><br />I read many reviews before I purchased this CD, but nobody really mentioned the fact that it was mostly just instrumental; so I want to mention that fact for future would-be buyers of this CD.
B000024ZYP|5.0|In questo disco ogni musicista, preso singolarmente, non ha bisogno di particolari presentazioni... <br />Insieme, cosa non sempre scontata, hanno saputo costruire una deliziosa alchimia sonora che mi ha sospinto in un viaggio meraviglioso con lievissima brezza soave. <br />Qui \\"comandano\\" anima ed istinto, non ho dubbi: un capolavoro.
B00000K0YC|5.0|I was sifting through the reviews already written, and saw someone say that Rollins wasn't as good as people like Paul Desmond and Stan Getz.  Frankly, I would have to say that is one of the more ridiculous things I've ever heard said about jazz.  Rollins is one of the great masters of jazz, on any insturment.  The only tenor player who I can clearly say is better than Rollins is Coltrane.  <br />Saxophone Colossus is the album that essentially made Rollins.  With Max Roach, Tommy Flanagan and Doug Watkins, this disc covers everything from the blues, to bop, to ballads, to carribean music.  They touch all the bases, and they touch them well.  'St. Thomas' is an incredible song which demonstrates Rollins almost unmatched ability to systematically develop a solo from the ground up.  Max Roach's drum solo is also fantastic.  'You Don't Know What Love Is' is probobly my favorite track.  Flanagan solo here is, in my opinion, his best on the record, possibly one of his best period.  'Strode Rode' is a hard-swingin' and kickin' track that shows off the quartet's ability to sit in the pocket and swing hard.  'Moritat' is my least favorite on the CD.  It's not bad my any means, it just doesn't speak to me in the way the other tracks do.  Finally, 'Blue 7' is the most simplistic, and in a way, brilliant track on the CD.  It's a pure, non-subsitution blues (in F i believe) that once again demonstrates perfectly Rollins ability to gradually build a solo.  He starts from the ground, and builds to a climax, then brings it back down again.  Also, Roach's 'melodic' drum solo is excellent here.<br />In short, this is probobly one of the top 10 records in jazz.  For new listeners, its a must have, and a perfect introduction to jazz.  For 'veteran' listeners, and for students of the style, it provides perfect examples for structuring solos, and for making complexity our of simplicity.
B0000013G9|1.0|This is probably \\"TLC's\\" worst ablum. There are good songs like \\"Water Falls\\", \\"Creep\\", \\"Diggin' on you\\" and \\"Kick some game\\". Basically it's the songs that were released as singles, that were good. With an exception to \\"Red Light Special\\". <br /> <br />The rest of the songs haven't been produced enough. They are way too flacid, and frankley unecessary. Especially \\"Girlfriend\\", which is a \\"Prince\\" remake. It'll grown on you for a while.  <br /> <br />But the feeling isn't lasting.
B00005JKGK|5.0|This is probably my most favorite movie. I've never known a movie that can literally \\"make me cry\\" when I watch it. Everytime I sit down to watch this movie, I'm hanging on every word and scene. I can feel the pain, so intensely! My heart goes out to Amy Tan, Oliver Stone, and all the wonderful and beautiful actresses in this film. The young, as well as, the elder. This is not just a \\"chick-flick!\\" The guys I share this film with walk away with a different perspective than they expected. It's the best movie to have on when your wife has all her friends over. Forget the movie \\"Now and Then\\" (with Demi Moore and Rosie McDowall?, McDonald? I dunno). Anyway, this film is truly psychologically engrossing!<br />I do wish this DVD had more special features added to it though. I really was looking forward to hearing and seeing the actors and actresses talking about this film they did. I usually don't like getting DVD's released with an extra DVD of specials (I mean, really, who'd watch some of those dumb extra features more than once?) But, if this movie had at least one documentary, like \\"American Graffiti\\" did, it would be so much better, because I've really come to feel that I'd like to know what these actresses perspectives were on this film.<br />I recommend, \\"Raise the Red Lantern\\" as your follow-up movie to watch. I understand that the DVD is available now.  Bollywood has a great eye-opening film, also. It's about the oppressed women of India. It's called \\"Lajja\\". Hard-headed, male-dominate religion is the terror of that film.  Plus, some of the most gorgeous actresses of India.
B00007E8O5|5.0|.......someone must be listening, and that someone is Jerry Cantrell. With his sophomore solo effort he makes a huge departure from the laid back vibe of Boggy Depot and churns out every sick emotion from his stomach in a visceral yet intricate exorcism that spans well over 140 minutes. While not sounding much like AIC, he still manages to bring out some of the darkest, heaviest, sludgiest music ever written, as well as showcasing Jerry's incredible song writing, a trademark of AIC that placed them in a class of their own that many try to reach yet often inadvertedly spit on, like Staind, Nickelback, and almost any other new \\"alternative/metal\\" band. Had Layne Staley been able to lay vocal tracks over this album it would have been cathartic (no offense to Cantrell, who is a great singer in his own right). Simply put, a comparison of this and any other album is laughable. There is nothing else like this. If you like Alice In Chains then you MUST buy this album. MUST!!!!!!!!!!!
B000084HAJ|2.0|My expectations for this DVD were very high given who the musicians are.  Everything pointed to a great purchase, but I will not be playing it again because the video quality is just too poor.  There is also some annoying clicking and the image gets very unreal, almost like something computer generated.  It could have been wonderful, given the illustrious singers, conductor and locale but someone did not take enough care in its production. Too bad!
B00003CXCT|3.0|Ok I was so happy when I heard Star Wars was being released on DVD.  I was starting to wonder why it had not already been released!!  I was like COOL cannot wait until Sept.  Now being a Star Wars fan I was hoping that this was the 77 release vs the SE release.  I was BLOWN AWAY to see that they changed the movies with CGI.  Now mind you I have seen nothing unitl tonight to let me know its being changed.  I am disappoited to say the least. <br /> <br />Star Wars was for me a magical movie that takes me back to my youth everytime I watch it.  I time travel back to days I spent with my Dad hunting for action figures (Because they were sold out) and watching the movies.  I feel that magic has been sold to the highest bidder in hopes of making money. <br /> <br />I am glad for two things.   <br /> <br />One, I managed to get the Trilogy in bootleg form and it is just the Special Edition. <br /> <br />Two, We live in the age of Blockbuster and Netflix and you can rent it and see how bad this is going to be! <br /> <br />Will I watch these movies? Yes because I think I should give it a chance but my hopes are not high!!
B00006LWSF|5.0|If you liked the movie, you must get the soundtrack as well! It goes perfectly with the film. I think more songs could have been included in the actual film such as \\"Wasting My Time\\" by Taryn Manning and Macy Gray's \\"Time of My Life\\".  The hit \\"Lose Yourself\\" is like the 2K version of \\"Eye of The Tiger\\" (from the Rocky films).  It's also rare to get rivals Nas and Jay-Z on the same album (another reason to pick up this cd)! The final track \\"Rabbit Run\\" is pretty much a Eminem freestyle session. The highlight track is \\"Love Me\\" with Em, 50 Cent, and Obie Trice. 50's sly remarks about R. Kelly, Lil' Kim and others very clever.  This is a great album from beginning to end.
1400032717|4.0|If you're looking for a quick read, then this is an excellent book.  It does everything a longer novel does, like evoking strong emotions, building memorable characters, and providing several twists and turns in an excellent plot. <br /> <br />The characters in this novel, and Christopher in particular (the protagonist) really came alive for me.  The author manages to make you feel connected with not only Christopher's struggles, but the struggles of those around him.   <br /> <br />I was amazed by Mr. Haddon's ability throughout this novel.
0553573403|4.0|I think George Martin has done a lot for the genre with this series. The world and plot (which is too complicated for me to review properly and can be read about elsewhere) is engaging and well paced. The multiple viewpoints as you progress give the book a real edge and keep you moving through the chapters quickly. He did it so well I think he's shaped the way a lot of fantasy books are written now. His writing is very good with a real sense of atmosphere created. As the only fault I felt let down with the strength of the characters in it. Maybe due to the style the book's set out in, there's no real depth; each character is a name with brief line's discription and that's effectively it. You aren't let deeply into any of their minds (often because their heads are chopped off soon after). Too many sulky kids,  roaring back-slapping men and other stereotypes with predicable actions and dialogue weaken some chapters, as in most fantasy novels. Not to end on a low, George Martin's violence scenes are some of the best I've read in any genre. A very good book well worth reading.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|And they're better then ever.  I really love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Most sequals scare me. You don't know if it's going to be better or worse.  But, X2 is truly a marvel no one should miss. Hugh Jackman is the man!! He is so good at what he does.  And, in this one, there is no limit.  Of course, if its Marval you know its gotta be good. More action and humor made it for me! My favorite character when I was little was Wolverine. So, you can tell who really made it for me. X2 is not a waste of your time. Even if you're not a fan you will like it.
B00005JMYG|5.0|If you love Will Ferrell's humor and the skits of Saturday Night Live, you will LOVE this film. The movie is totally random like one SNL skits after another. This movie is non stop laughs, the whole theater was laughing out loud constantly. My cheeks hurt after I watched it I laughed so much and I don't usually laugh out loud during a movie. It gets funnier every time. I watched it twice in the theater two days in a row.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I nearly cried when I saw this movie. The music and the story will do that to you. But, WOW! Who could do this but Russle Crowe. I've never seen one of his movies that I've never liked.  I like the part were he sees his son and wife dead. And, then it starts. He loses it. You can almost see the anger on his face. Its on now! Also, when he is talking to his troops at the battle. What we do does echo after death. That is so true! And, what a grand entrance. A headless horseman.  Doesn't that send a message. You know right then how thoes people feel. They won't waste words. But, this one does wonders for you!
B0000024KQ|4.0|After unleashing their fury on the rap audience on their 1993 title-says-it-all debut \\"Bacdafucup\\", one of the rawest and roughest pieces of work in hiphop up to that date, a sonic desert of an album in which traces of what could be called a melody had to be sought for thouroughly in some songs, the south Queens group called Onyx popped up again with what would probably be the best album in their history<br /><br />Evidently, the ferocious balhedz kept it hardcore on this follow-up. Still, the production style is different - MC Fredro Starr did almost all the production and his arrangements are impressively skillful. \\"Last Dayz\\" is an incredible opener and, even though it's hardcore rap, a cleverly implanted vocal sample and its background melody provide this song more soul than any Onyx track had before. The following title track is rougher and more like what you would have expected, but with \\"Purse Snatchaz\\" kicking in you are already taken back to vocal samples and a sound that was typical for N.Y. hiphop in the mid-90's but in the case of Onyx was a clear sign of progression<br /><br />Now I am not trying to say that musically this album is completly different from their popular first effort, and the more melodic style is not ubiquitous on here - many tracks have a very similar feel to them that the tracks on \\"Bacdafucup\\" had, for example \\"Shout\\" is not far from the famous bawling anthem \\"Slam\\"<br /><br />Lyrically, this album comes to me as a little bit more serious than their oldest work. While Sticky Fingaz still tends to put himself into the role of the completly deranged maniac that made him famous and unique, he does say some more thoughtful and true stuff at times, a side of his that he would not show completly before his great solo album \\"Black Trash\\" a few years later. Fredro and Sonsee, while not having Sticky's charisma and comically insane style, contribute to the lyrical side of this album doing relentless hardcore verses, Fredro often outshining the others as for flow and other technicalities<br /><br />Generally, if you like some other Onyx stuff, this album should be nice for you. In hindsight, one can say that the state the group was in in 1995 was only a logical part of its progress and the album they created during this time might be the highlight in a catalog of solid to very good releasesother technicalities    Generally, if you like some other Onyx stuff, this album should be nice for you.

B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This is a great cd. Its not as good as Lloyd Banks or Young Buck cd. But what makes this cd good is that every song is worth listening to. There are not a lot of smash hits. But this cd is still good. Some of the skits are hella funny. <br />The stand out songs are <br />Loyalty <br />Ill be damned <br />My band <br />Bitch <br />How Come <br />40 oz <br />Good die young. <br /> <br />Also if you're an Eminem fan then get this album since He appears on almost every song. <br /> <br />
B000069HJL|5.0|Supertramp's ivories were sure being tickled on a November night in 1979, just another concert in a huge tour prompted by the chart topping success of their latest album \\"Breakfast in America.\\" Before an extremely excited audience at the Paris Pavilion, Supertramp delivered a colorful performance, captured here on the double live album simply titled \\"Paris,\\" released in 1980. The group is in great condition, and just as enthusiastic as the appreciative audience. The magic of the album is not found in major variations or re-arrangements (because there are hardly any at all), but rather in the pure charm of a Supertramp performance. The English supergroup gives vigorous, dynamic readings of their hits such as `The Logical Song,' `Take the Long Way Home,' and `Bloody Well Right' and some of their most essential album pieces including `A Soapbox Opera,' the grand `Fool's Overture' and a dramatic version of `Crime of the Century' which contains even more feeling than the already powerful studio version. Another highlight is the lovelorn, jazzy `You Started Laughing\\" which features great melancholy saxophone work from John Helliwell. Bassist Dougie Thomson and drummer Bob C. Benberg shine with great musicianship, and the keyboards and vocals of songwriters Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies give the renditions their trademark Supertramp sound. The spoken banter to the audience is charming as well, though to understand most of it, one must be fluent in French.<br /><br />While \\"Paris\\" may not offer a wide variety of new variations, it remains an alluring item, and after all there are few musical experiences that are as worthwhile as an evening with Supertramp. The music here is catchy, dignified, often moving, and always rich in taste. The entire group as a unit pour their respective personalities into these masterful performances to give create the unmistakable quirky-yet-sophisticated English pop that made them such an entertaining admirable band.
B00008K9Z5|2.0|I heard this album by a friend and I didn't see difference about the 1st album. This is just the same thing... It's sounds like a certain scrapy pop rock (I can't believe we call it ROCK). The Chester voice is to horrible when he yell and the turntable n'machines don't have place in the band. I just want to say many bands deserve more attention than this generation of &quot;Gently Rock&quot;...
B0000024V2|5.0|Johnny has always been my hero, mainly because, when i was growing up in London- England I'd had so much Clapton/Hendrix/Alvin Lee/Jimmy Page shoved down my throat. Although I still loved these others too, I was refreshed to hear someone who sounded unique. Johnny Winter was that person...he sounded different, he could sing, and he LOOKED different. I remember in one of his 1973 interviews how Johnny Winter spoke of an ardent fan who wanted to spend an evening just looking at him..this person was astounded just by Winter's visual impact alone. As the other reviewer said above, Johnny wasn't scared of taking chances musically. <br /> Percy Mayfields classic blues \\"Memory Pain\\" has never sounded so good. It seems like it was written for Johnny personally. His guitar screams in agony with wonderfully phrased licks. I remember this tune took up one whole l.p. side originally.(or at least, nearly a whole side!) <br /> Every other track is astounding and the variety is endless. Alot of delicious psychedelic blues...e.g. \\"Good Love\\" Fast Life Rider\\" I'm Not Sure\\"...but these are mixed in with some 50s teeny bop classics  ..e.g. \\"Slippin' & Slidin'\\" and \\"Miss Ann\\". The musicianship is always at a continual high throughout. My own favorite from this album has always been an unusual choice of song called \\"I Love Everybody\\".  This one starts with a background giggle and then launches into some of the most blinding , relentless slide guitar ever played. It's a basic Delta blues song but Johnny takes it into electro-psychedelic outer-space...the channels shift as he plays the solo, which adds to the jet propelled tension. This song, by itself, is PURE, UTTER brilliance and a wonderful variation on a basic Delta blues. <br /> The songs counterpart is one called \\"I Hate Everybody\\" which is almost arranged like a T. Bone Walker 'jump blues' and Winters solo is very jazz- inflected ...lightnin' fast and precise. <br /> Edgar Winters sax solo on this one is pure bebop influenced. <br/>  This album/c.d is SO varied that when I first heard it I was utterly confused (especially for me, back at that time in 1970). <br /> Back then there was either bubble- gum pop,  heavy rock or folk in the English charts. <br /> This one was/is unique and i don't think it will ever be equalled.
B00004W52U|5.0|Whenever Im at odds with what I should listen to at any given moment, or if I only bring a few bits of music in the car, this album will always be near. Im sure many people know, and hopefully appreciate, the buzz this band has and still continues to create. Im also not one of those people who say stuff like this is cool because the band is no more and to gain social acceptance, because that is not honorable. Simply put, this figgin rocks. <br /> <br />I didnt get into Op Ivy until about four years ago, and Im still kicking myself for not discovering this music earlier. Ive always liked Rancid, and \\"Lets Go\\" is top notch, but this still ranks higher in my book. Nearly every song is phenomenal. Of course, as with any record, there are one or two songs that dont move you the way the rest does, but thats life. Regardless, \\"Energy\\" is just that, pure, crisp, uncanny, relentless, virgin energy. the sound quality is nice and raw, and it sounds like the band is playing a live set. I think \\"The Crowd\\" just may be my personal favorite, with Matt's super cool bass parts. But I feel bad saying that because there are so many great songs featured here, and listen to the guitar intro on \\"Yellin in my Ear\\"...how cool is that? Go out and get this if you dont have it, or if you do have it, pop it in and jam.  <br /> <br />WHAT I WOULDNT GIVE FOR A OPERATION IVY/DESCENDENTS REUNION TOUR. IF IT WAS ONLY IN CALI ID SELL MY MUSIC FOR THE TIX TO THAT SHOW!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I never saw this movie in the theatre or rented it. I did over the weekend and I am happy I did. This movie is just so beautiful and very religious. The message is what we all need to hear about because of all the hates in the world.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I don't throw the term \\"greatest\\" around too often; but for a fan of the franchise, what more could you possibly want?   <br /> <br />There are 2 versions of every movie, the theatrical edition and a special edition.  The crown-jewel of which (for me) was a never-before-seen work-print version of Alien 3.  Granted, the last two Alien sequels were extremely disappointing (Alien Resurrection's ending may be the worst in film history) but there is just SO MUCH INCULDED in this set that it is a MUST OWN for anyone who grew up on Alien! <br />
B0002DB52M|5.0|Most of the controversy surrounding Dogville seems to be centered around its 'ideas,' but I would go out on a limb and say it is not a picture of ideas. It is straightforward, visceral, and, in a way, very realistic. Potential viewers will not have to worry about being bored by some vague, pretentious message explained in an abstract artsy style. What Dogville presents, instead of moral allegory, is - in the fashion of Lord of the Flies, the works of Jerzy Kosinski and, more recently, the Japanese Battle Royale - a simple portrait of how people will behave under certain extreme circumstances. Dogville clearly has no moral; its moralizing characters are punished perhaps the most severely. It does establish moral _problems_ which give the viewer something to consider after the film is over. What it does best, though, is engage the viewer and cleverly play with their sympathies. It connects on the level of a horror film in the intimate associations formed with the characters. Some people are sure to be scared off by its long duration or its developing reputation as an 'art' film, but hopefully Dogville will find the audience it deserves. It is not an 'important' film or an 'experiment,' but first-rate, harrowing entertainment.
B000002J29|5.0|\\"Seconds Out\\" is an achievement without parallel: in this reviewer's opinion, it's the best live album ever, the best Genesis album, and one of the three best progressive rock albums of all time.     From start to finish, this album is astonishing in its excellence. Tracks like \\"Squonk\\" and \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" have immense sonic power; \\"Cinema Show\\" and \\"The Carpet Crawl\\" offer the delicacy of angels. And all of this is captured in a recording of incredible clarity, warmth, and dynamic range.     Perhaps most amazing of all, the band takes songs from the Peter Gabriel-era and, with Phil Collins singing, actually improves on them with better production and engineering. Truly a pinnacle of modern music.
B000244FDW|5.0|First of all, in my opinion there are only two film adaptations of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that are worth discussing, the 1980 version that was made to air on \\"Masterpiece Theater\\" and the 1996 version by A&E.  Each has its charms but this one is my favorite.  Admittedly it is not as polished, but the casting is superb and the dialogue stays closer to the book both in content and in spirit.   <br /> <br /> My love of Jane Austin's work and other classic literature began with watching this adaptation of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" on Masterpiece Theater in 1980.  It was an absolute treat. I remember waiting impatiently over the 5 weeks that it aired for each new episode.  Several years later when it came out on VHS I had to have it and was every bit as enchanted as I had been in my early teens.  I've since worn through two copies of the tapes and was getting ready to order a third when I stumbled across the DVD.  Needless to say, that's what I ordered to replace the tapes. <br /> <br /> I am absolutely delighted with the DVD.  I had gotten so familiar with the tapes that I was stunned when 'extra' scenes that I had forgotten about began to appear. This is the whole thing!  It has not been edited down like the VHS tapes.  I spent a very comfortable afternoon getting re-acquainted with this old favorite.  I whole-heartedly recommend it.   (Now if I could only get the 1983 version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" on DVD, I'd have nothing left to wish for.) <br />
B000002J2D|4.0|Let's clear up some confusion here: a lot of long-time Genesis fans feel Genesis fell apart when Steve Hackett left the band prior to \\"And Then There Were Three.\\"     This isn't true, and this album is very, very good, with great writing and production, and a progressive sound. Genesis' fall from grace was caused not by personnel changes, but rather by attitude changes immediately after this album.     This album is, in many ways, as good as its predecessor, \\"Wind and Wuthering.\\" The album opens with a bang: \\"Down and Out\\" is pedal-to-the-metal prog, with huge organ riffs and wild time signatures. \\"Burning Rope\\" is a classic mini-epic with inspiring, if not slightly clich, lyrics. \\"The Lady Lies\\" is a great effort at spinning a classic Genesis medieval tale. \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Snowbound\\" are pleasant ballads. Even the hit single \\"Follow You Follow Me\\", which cynics have criticized, has a very pleasant vibe (and is infinitely superior to Wind and Wurthering's awful ballad, \\"You Have Your Own Special Way.\\")     This is the last good Genesis album. And then there were none...
B00009TB5G|4.0|<br /> <br />As we once again incounter our hero's on their quest to destroy the one ring, we find ourselves in a trance with the love of the film. What I mean by love is the wonderful scenes in this film. The beauty, the lust, it reminds me of Lawrence of Arabia in some way. The way Peter Jackson has the sun in the backround when Aragorn,Legolas, and Gimli (Yes I memorized all of their names) run towards it. And the acting, my god, when you talk about dramatic actors, you think of plain old dramas, not fantasy epics. Believe me this film can get dramatic, but is this film is as dramatic as the first one, well no. <br /> <br />The first one is way better. The drama, the beginning of it all, the sadness, and there's something about the fight scenes that seem real in some way. The \\"Fellowship\\" focuses on the acting, not action, \\"The Two Towers\\" has useless, mindless action for the audience. Instead of focusing on the Hobbits and what these characters have to go threw to believe that they can destroy evil. What we get is a 45 minute action scene and Gandolf riding down a hill to save his friend. If this film kept the same pace of the first film, then I would give this film five stars. <br />
B000002J2F|2.0|During the 80s and 90s, Genesis would release many lousy albums, and this is the first. Compared with Genesis prior to this album, \\"Duke\\" is sort of like giving Dali or Picasso a frontal lobotomy, and then watching them drool helplessly while wearing a straightjacket.    \\"Misunderstanding\\" is a terribly simplistic song better suited to Barry Manilow; \\"Please Don't Ask\\" might have worked for James Taylor or Bread. But these songs aren't Genesis.    The only good tracks are \\"Behind the Lines\\" (first half only) and the awe-inspiring closing suite, \\"Duke's Travels/Duke's End\\", which fully reveals Genesis' potential.     Otherwise, this album is mind-numbingly simple and uninventive. Do yourself a favor - buy all Genesis albums before this one.
B00008LDPU|4.0|\\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\", \\"Kid's Story\\", and \\"The Second Renaissance part 1 and 2\\", will explain more about the matrix than any of the three film, the difference is that the original film is original. Like I said about \\"Revolutions\\", we simply don't know what their talking about, the Wachowski's just can't keep it simple. \\"Final Flight\\", \\"Renaissance 1 and 2\\" give me more information than I needed, but how was Neo born, and what's the purpose of Trinity. Well aparantly we'll never know. <br /> <br />THE PLOT  <br /> <br />Welcome to \\"The Animatrix\\", a visionary fusion of CG-animation and Japanese anime from the world's most revered anime directors. Experience the prequel to \\"The Matrix\\" and learn about the last cities of mankind. Witness \\"The Final Flight Of The Osiris\\", which stes the stage for \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\" and \\"Enter The Matrix\\". Expand your mind even further, it's time to plug in. <br /> <br />This was a good anime, considering that this film is going up against \\"Ghost In The Shell\\", and \\"Akira.\\" Brovo Wachowski's, brovo.
B000002J2B|4.0|This is the last truly great Genesis album.     The album opens with one of the band's strongest songs ever, the exuberant, dynamic \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar.\\" The last three songs are also excellent, from the elegant dramatic ballad \\"Blood on the Rooftops,\\" the brooding, mysterious \\"Unquiet Earth,\\" and the hauntingly beautiful \\"Afterglow.\\"     Unfortunately, the songs in between are flawed: \\"One for the Vine\\" is an epic marred by substandard composition. \\"You Have Your Own Special Way\\" is a sickeningly sweet foretaste of the commercial Genesis of the future. \\"Wot Gorilla\\" is a pointless fusion instrumental. \\"All in a Mouse's Night\\" is - no pun intended - a bit cheesy.     But the highlights are clearly among the best Genesis songs ever. If only the band had stayed in the studio a bit long longer, \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" would have been a 5-star masterpiece.
B00028HBKM|5.0|<br /> <br />Jesus Quotes: \\"Love one another as you have loved me, so love one another.\\" If you can get past the outlandish violence in this film, you'll see what that quote means. <br /> <br />THE PLOT  <br /> <br />Mel Gibson's crowning acheivement is about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life. <br /> <br />THE CRITICS <br /> <br />I will always see why people like this film, but the bigger challenge is hating the film. \\"The Passion Of The Christ\\" is the most controversial film of this century, but I respect the people who don't like this film. 1. It's not as acurate as some people may think. 2. The violence obviously. 3. The crucifixion and his death.  <br /> <br />One of the last scenes is the crucifixion. This scene is enough to give you a heart attack. As he remembers his last words he said to his friends, the nail pierces into his skin and the rest you already know. His last words as their nailing him to the cross, \\"They know not what they do, they know not what they do.\\" This scene will inprint itself in my mind for years to come, this scene makes me realize that Christ died for us and thats all there is. He was born to die, he lived cause he was going to die for us, to redeem us.  <br /> <br />
B000002IST|1.0|Like trying to avoid the inevitable breakup with a lover, this album is Genesis' sorry end. You know, everything from the conversation to attempts at intimacy just hurt because you know breaking up is inevitable. And what makes it so you hard is you used to be so in love....    The awful quasi-title track, I Can't Dance, is a clear indicator of how awful this album is. Phil Collins - with the reluctant agreement of Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford - decided it would be clever to release an absurdly minimalist single that had no melody, no rhythm, and an inane lyric repeated over and over. Collins' gag was to see how many people would be tricked into believing it's really a song, sort of like hanging a blank canvas in an art gallery and seeing how many people ponder its \\"meaning.\\"     Jesus He Knows Me is another great trick: social commentary with a catchy pop hook? No, just a lousy song. The other tracks on this interminable album are equally pointless and uninspired. And sure enough, after this album Collins realized the relationship was washed up and he quit the band. One album later, Genesis broke up for good.    Like breaking up, this album really hurts.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is an incredible film, it throw you against the wall and pounds the world out of you. And just when you think it's over, the film shoots you and leaves for dead. <br /> <br />THE PLOT <br /> <br />The fourth film by acclaimed writer and director Quentin Tarantino is about a woman name the Bride(Uma Thurman). Years after taking a bullet in the head, she seeks revenge on the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad. <br /> <br />I love this film and I hope you'll like it to.
B00003OSTQ|5.0|I recently watched a new movie called \\"OutFoxed\\" (avail at Amazon?) about the very subject this movie satires. If you enjoy(ed) this movie, I would also recommend HIGHLY, OutFoxed. The first time I saw \\"Network\\" in 1976, it was just entertaining... a great cast in a great, original movie plot. I rented it again a few years ago and loved it even more. For days after, it was fist shaking and \\"I'm mad as HELL, ...\\" . Amazingly, the last two years of network history have become so much like this movie that it has been transformed into an odd classic. A must for the permanent collection.
B00005JKN9|4.0|<br /> <br />Before I begin my review, I would like to say congratulations Martin Scorcese for adding yet another great film to your long career. This is the kind of film that doesn't hold anything back; the violence, the lifestyles these characters live, and like always Mr. Scorsese leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. What I mean by \\"bad taste\\" is the sinful images that this films evokes. The killing, the prostitution, the revenge are all sinful things. <br /> <br />THE PLOT <br /> <br />The film starts in 1846 and ends in 1863 with the draft riots. The setting is New York's five points, the most violent part of the world at the time. The story is risen out of the conflicts between the whit Anglo-Saxon \\"natives\\" and the Irish immigrants coming into the five points. One boy needs to avenge the death of his father. <br /> <br />THE ACTORS <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the greatest natural actors that I've seen since Michael Keaton. Natural acting is getting into character but at the same time still being yourself; in other words you're infusing your own personality with the character your assigned to portray in the film. <br /> <br />Gary Cooper was a natural and so was Spencer Tracy. Leo's performance in this film is far better than \\"Titanic.\\" In \\"Gangs of New York\\" Leo shows an unending rage that the audience has never seen before, in \\"Titanic\\" he's just a pretty boy. One of the problems with Leo's performance is that his accent comes and goes through out the film, just as Mel Gibson's accent did during \\"Braveheart.\\" Mel wasn't nominated for best actor in \\"Braveheart\\" so I don't think Leo will get nominated for this movie for some of the same reasons, one being accent authenticity. However, I will expect a nomination for him in `Catch Me If You Can.'  <br /> <br />Daniel Day-Lewis's gives his best performance since \\"My Left Foot.\\" Daniel has always shown the dark of every character that he's played and he incorporates some kindness and humanity as well in his performances.  <br /> <br />I expect an Oscar win for Daniel but Dennis Quaid presents immense competition in his performance in \\"Far From Heaven.' Cameron Diaz has been giving terrible performances since \\"Any Given Sunday\\" but with \\"Gangs Of New York\\" she's proved her dramatic ability is still intact and is once again one of my favorite dramatic actresses. <br /> <br />THE PROBLEMS <br /> <br />One of the problems with this film is the first battle scene. Every time Daniel Day-Lewis knifed someone there was no blood present. That's when I understood what Roger Ebert was talking about when he said, \\"Scorsese didn't put all of his heart into this film.\\" I now know what he's talking about because you can tell Martin was not into this story because of his directing. Usually Scorsese tells the story and keeps the audience interested with his directing. His directing carries all of his films, but in this film he lets the actors carry the film and not his directing. That's not Scorcese's style but that is Spielberg's style, Spielberg puts the camera or trails the camera with the actor and just lets them act; no fancy editing and barely any music. Spielberg's directing style is similar to David Lean's style in many ways. Scorsese is a dynamic director. He puts the camera between the actors; he uses music as he manipulates the scene constantly as he goes.... crazy with the camera. Sometimes he adds various types of lighting to his scenes to describe them, and he always uses slow motion via editing and camera work to go from actor to actor. His work is not static. In some films he uses a single tone to bring you into the scene. In \\"Gangs of New York\\" he forgot why he's famous in the first place. He forgot why people love him as a director and as an artist. In \\"Kundun\\" he changed his style purposely for the film and it was evident because he directs \\"Kundun\\" the way David Lean would direct \\"Kundun\\" using a similar style, and I expected that. I believe he directed \\"Kunden\\" the way he visualized it and the film worked. I felt no emotion when he is directing of \\"Gangs of New York', because the emotion for the entirety of the film is carried by the actors. I was disappointed this by this movie for those reason I listed. My message to Scorsese is stick to what you know best and what you do best.... better than any other director. Scorsese did remember the fireworks. In every film of Scorsese there are fireworks. <br /> <br /> <br />
6305537321|5.0|I loved this film. Although the story was... well, thin, the charm and grace of Audrey made this a superb classic. If you like romances, and/or Hepburn films, you will definitely love it too! <br /> <br />Mickey Rooney... added for comic relief, but is hideously unfair to the portrayal of the Japanese. It shocked me that such an otherwise well thought out film could have such a flaw, its bewildering. Some may find him funny, but others, like myself, just find it borderline racist. He throws a pejorative light on Japanese men, but was it SO hard to get an actual Japanese actor?! I don't think there would be so much uproar had the landlord been cast as a disgruntled Russian, or other nationality, but still... <br /> <br />So, overall, a damn good film, but try not to pay much attention to Rooney.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|<br /> <br />\\"The Matrix Revolutions\\" is a celabration on how far we've gotten with CGI, but there's nothing in the film that I can like. Their's bad acting, bad script, the film doesn't give us any ideas or an answer. We get the fact that every one will be free, but free from what, the matrix, or the real world. To be honest with you, I was expecting to be a child in the film, the son of Neo. I thought that was the reason of the dance/love scene in \\"Reloaded\\", but no. We get mindless,Mindless action, and you don't even want to know the ending. <br /> <br />There's just no point to this story anymore, I don't even want to see the prequals, unless we get to know more about the characters, but I definetly don't want to see the fourth one, if it happens. The Oracle Quotes: \\"Neo is trapped somewhere between this world and the machine world.\\" This is a sign that the Wachowski's are truly bored of this saga, cause they don't tell us anything about this world between the Matrix and the machine world. But this is a okay film, because of the ending and the visual effects, and the last fight between Agent Smith and Neo is spectacular, but thats all,kinda dissapointing. <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|Unparalleled movie about Jesus. I went to see this with my wife and we both sat there in awe knowing that this is what Jesus had done for us to pay for our sins. When the movie was over we really couldn't talk. We left the theater quietly and the silence was the same in the car on the way home. I even tried to turn on some beautiful worship music and somehow it seemed shallow. I had to turn the music off. Only quiet would do. This movie was an experience not entertainment. I found myself pondering within myself for days after. I am grateful to Mel Gibson for his movie and of course to Jesus for paying the penalty for my sins.
B00005JMUA|5.0|<br /> <br />Bill's Quotes: Superman's costume is not superman it's Clarke Kent. His other personality is Clark Kent, He was born Superman.\\" What Bill(David Carradine) is trying to explain is that Uma's character was born as the Black Mamba, her alter ego is \\"The Bride.\\" SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br />Quentin once again proves that he is a master film maker and he is God in Hollywood. What he try's to do is show who these characters are. You learn to like Bill inspite of yourself, we know he's a horrible person, we know he's a killer, his talent is killing, but we do know he obviously loves her. He did a horrible act out of love for her. <br /> <br />Chris Rock's Quote: \\"Have you ever loved somebody so much that sometimes you want to kill them.\\" That quote sort of makes sense in this film. This is a Quentin Tarantino love story. Some people feel sorry for Bill because he loves her. Not that people will kill in the name of love, but some have. Now all of a sudden Uma Thurman is the bad guy for at least a little while, but you feel sympathetic to her aim as well. She wants revenge, because he did wrong by her, she feels betrayed, like he cheated her in some way, cheated her by taking the idea of a normal life for her and her baby. <br /> <br />I don't like Bill, but I do understand why he did what he did, and I understand why the Bride feels so angry. And with there last words, Bill Quotes: I love you Kiddo. The Bride Quotes: I love you to. In my opinion, this is one of the craziest and one of the best love story's ever created. <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore has the right to make up this garbage but all I can say is... OK, but I'm not the one going to hell.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|Originally I was disinclined to see this movie. I thought it was going to be some cheesey vampire movie. I was channel surfing the other night and came across the movie on HBO and figured it wont hurt to watch it and if anything I'll fall asleep.  I was up till 5am making sure i saw the end. The movie is very intersting and keeps you glued. The emotions and attitudes of the characters are believable. The computer graphics are obvious but they look good. The storyline is a bit up in the air. It seems that the writers just wanted to get some information out about vampires and werewolves and their histories together. Aside from that the movie played well and kept me awake when i expected to fall asleep. I bought this the same day (which is rare for me because i save every penny i find for my future house and car)
B0000029GA|5.0|I HAVE TWO COPIES. ONE FOR THE WALL AND DA other one to listen to every day. dis lp is one of my top 5 lp ever.
B00004ZD69|5.0|when I listened to the track \\"sleep\\" I immediately was brought back to my childhood years because it's starts off with an old man talking about his younger years on Coney Island and how they slept on the beach and stuff. I was so happy, it made me all emotional, but it ended so sad!! things change, he said...they don't sleep on the beach anymore! I started to cry and for the entire cd I was on the verge of tears like Why?! Why don't they sleep on the beach?? This music is awesome, anyways....it's so sad and easy to listen to especially at nigth when you are alone.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Loved these movies growing up. The first two are amazing and the third one is good. I have been waiting for years for these to come out but my excitement had dwindled since finding out we would not get the original versions; the ones we saw in the theatres in the late 70's.  Fine, Lucas wanted to update some thing. I dont have a problem with that but when you change key plot points and whole character arcs because the Director has changed his mind than who are the losers except the people that paid Lucas and supported these movies originally?<br /><br />Guido shooting first is one of the biggest travesties to this trilogy and that is first and formost why I wont buy it.<br /><br />How about both versions Lucas? That too much to ask?<br /><br />I'd rather pay more to get the originals on Laserdisc and convert them myselves.
B00018TI5E|5.0|Let me start by saying I've never been a big RHCP fan (like 'em fer sure, but...)-- so I'm not one of those reviewers.  Also, I find the earlier Frusciante albums somewhat inaccessible but haven't invested a lot of time (so I'm not one of those freaks saying the album is overproduced or sterile).    I bought this album on a whim after hearing a few songs on Internet radio.  I'm pretty sure the album is perfect except for some of the Eno-type stuff (which is still good like the musical Bowie, \\"Low\\" stuff).  I like my music a little polished so the earlier stuff is a little inaccessible to me and \\"Will to Death\\" and \\"Automatic Writing\\" aren't quite the same as this. So, to be clear I'm talking about the album itself which is the right blend of spooky, well-produced, soul-bearing, sloppy, flinging grit guitar, moog-type noise slipped in the back, great drumming, funny but oddly working falsetto backup and great, great, great songs.  So now I'm a big John Frusciante fan and will probably sit and rewind solo's off Californiacation like the 17-year-olds but let it kick-off some regression.    NOTABLES  CARVEL - marvellous, epic in places, the breaks are scattered to delight,  groovy in places, best lyrics of the century - is it funny? sad? \\"driving to eat a Carvel cake\\" - who cannot relate?  OMISSION - crazy falsetto backup - what's that?  REGRET - perfectly cast - stumbling acoustic with crashing dumb synths - vocalizer smartly used so voice slips underwater in the recollection of bad things done to oneself.  RICKY - \\"and if it's life it resolves\\"; identity mess-ups;  I don't know what to call the backups but kind of 'do-woppy' - works for me  THIS COLD -  TIME GOES BACK - guitar breaks  CHANCES - the little synth bit at the end -  -----all the other songs, too....
B000002MUN|5.0|WILDFLOWERS, Tom Petty's second solo album, is a masterpiece. Most of the songs are great, especially \\"Time To Move On\\", which is one of numerous songs that express why I've decided that a good way to keep my weight down is to not go back to my old school's Thanksgiving dinner, and \\"Higher Place\\", which, in some ways describes the same situation for me, but has numerous other meanings as well. \\"You Wreck Me\\" is just a great rock & roll song. A few songs appear a little bit careless as far as composition, but the album as a whole matches Petty's late 70s/early 80s peak.
6305079811|1.0|An utterly horrible adaptation of the original comic book strip and series which has steadily acquired a cult status since its release almost 25 years ago.  An unequivocally atrocious production where every aspect of the film is horribly cheap, fake, and just appallingly bad.    Emperor Ming the Merciless(Max Von Sydow) from the planet Mongo wants the Earth destroyed. A quarterback from Earth named Flash Gordon (Sam J. Jones) must now save the day with the help of friends such as the Hawkmen and their leaders (Brian Blessed and Timothy Dalton.)  Will he save the Earth and humanity from imminent destruction?  Will the seductive daughter of the evil Ming (Ornella Muti) fall for Flash and his athletic build?    This has to be one of the most pathetic science fiction films ever made.  As with 'Highlander', Queen's music is about the only thing that keeps audiences interested in this trash film: even that is getting old. A totally contrived film that can only be seen as a bad joke.  There's no direction, acting, or anything else worth praising about this stupid film.  If you're not one of the film's cult fans, proceed and watch with caution: rent it first to see if this low level of quality in film making is within your standards.
B000065AI3|5.0|Tom Petty's debut album shoots him and his Heartbreakers out of the gate with a bang. The album produced several songs, including \\"Breakdown\\", \\"American Girl\\", and \\"Anything That's Rock & Roll\\", which became FM standards, and also includes the undiscovered gems \\"Fooled Again (I Don't Like It)\\" and \\"The Wild One, Forever.\\" The music sounds like a bridge between the Eagles-Allmans-Steve Miller mainstream and the punk/new wave of Graham Parker and Elvis Costello. Petty's advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000000OQY|4.0|This was a good 2nd album, but definately not an Appetite.  Included is the slow acoustic You're Crazy, which I like better.  Less than 34 minutes.  I've been told that the first 4-songs are fake-live.
B00005JMCT|5.0|All 3 films of the American Pie series are hilarious and are 5 star worthy so I cannot tell which one is the best of the series or which one is the weakest of the series.  I have noticed that American wedding has recieved alot of bad reviews, I really do not know why.  This was a great ending to the series.  Many of the jokes were original and hilarious (There was a scene where Steve Stifler literally ate dog crap, sure it was gross but it was funny as hell) plus the bachelor party was hot!!!!  Plus I really love the fact that Steve Stifler had a major part in the movie when originally he was just a co-character in the first American Pie.  He had to be everybody's favorite charcter of the series because of the way he behave and all he ever thinks about is getting laid. In this film, he is more perverted then ever.  Anyway here is the plot. <br />After dating Michelle for years, Jim decides it is time to pop the question.  Even though his attempt to propose to her in the perfect way ends up going horribly wrong, Michelle says yes!  So now it is time to plan a wedding which means they have to do the usual things- Find a dress, decide where to get married, and meet the new relatives.  Jim and his friends (Stifler, Finch, and Kevin) try to do whatever the can to help without getting into trouble or end up getting into sexual situations.  Stifler is only being part of the wedding because Jim said he can plan his bachelor party.  Plus things start to become very interesting when Stifler and Finch both meet Michelle's very attractive sister Cadence and both try to compete for her affection.  Stifler starts to suck up to Candence's parents and behaves like Finch only on front of them and Candence.  That prompts Finch to start behaving like Stifler, he starts calling himself the \\"Finchmeister\\".  Ironically she like both of their acts. <br />In general, American Wedding was one flat out hilarious movie.  A Perfect way to end the series.  The only thing I hated was the absenceof many of the characters like Nadia, Oz, Vicky, Heather , and Sherman.  There was one scene where Stifler mentioned Nadia but that was it.  It would have been nice to see them.  Other then that I really loved this movie and anybody who wants to laugh should see this film.
B000000OSE|3.0|I'd give the best of UYI1&2 as a single album a 4-star rating.  Although as a fan, it is nice to have all the tracks GNR could release in its short career, even obscure cover songs on SI.  I'd add Don't Damn Me and Bad Obsession to the \\"best of\\" rack version.  Usually I listen to UYI1&2 material when I've had enough of the first two albums.
0671891634|5.0|I don't know why some readers give it a low grade. Investment is a combination of art, science and legwork.  You cannot beat the market by scientific calculation only.  Even Warren Buffett has to use 85% value investing and 15% growth investing.  Don't over-emphasis on quantitative technique, qualitative technique on growth rate estimation is a must!
B000000OQF|5.0|GNR's first and best studio album.  Like Mr. Brownstone: \\"I used to do a little but a little wasn't doing so a little got more and more.\\"  Small time fans are likely to at least be familiar with Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and Sweet Child O' Mine.  This album has the fast metal version of You're Crazy and the full version of Sweet Child (no edit/remix).
B00005JMAH|2.0|Whoever hired this director should be smacked hard. That was about the worst choice they could have possibly made for Director. He needlessly changed so much. Why change the whole look of the school? It was wonderfully magical in the first two movies. In this one it looked totally different, and to no purpose. The costumes also were terrible. Dumbledore looked more like a homeless person than a headmaster of Hogwarts. I realize you were working with a different actor, but you could at least stay true to the character from the book. And what was the deal with the kids' costumes? They were always wearing street clothes when the books made it clear they only wore clothes like that when they were in the Muggle world. Effects were okay, although I agree with a lot of other people that the werewolf stunk. It looked like he somehow stopped transforming half way through. Finally, the look, the tone of the film was all wrong. In the first two movies the muggle world was all gray and flat, reflecting Harry's view of that world. Then the wizard world at Hogwarts was colorful and vibrant because that was where Harry really came alive. This movie, though, has the wizard world all flat and gray and dingy. Why? To what purpose? I know the kids are growing up and becoming more adult, but Hogwarts shouldn't change. We could get a perfectly good picture of the kids growing up without changing the school from a vibrant magical world to a dreary awful place. I was horribly disappointed in this movie. Whoever hired this director for this movie must have been drunk to think he could pull it off. One final thing: the imdb trivia mentions that the fountain at the school has eagles eating snakes because it is the symbol on the Mexican flag where the director comes from. What rubbish! It is perfectly fine and appropriate for him to put imagery like that into a movie about Mexico. But this is a British film about a British school in Great Britain, for pity's sake! Get over yourself already and don't put pointless extra stuff in that doesn't fit in the story. Sheesh! Probably the only thing I enjoyed about the movie was seeing the next bit of storyline in the Harry Potter world. I hope the Director for Goblet of Fire goes back to Chris Columbus's vision of Harry Potter.
B00005JMUA|1.0|Kill Bill 1 is one of the best movies I have ever seen but then when I saw kill bill 2 I was so upset.... I watched the movie with my mother and father and my mom fell asleep and my dad wanted to fast foward....... The movie took too long to long to get to the point and there was a certain part of the movie where she is talking to a spanish guy looking for bill and I dont understand why she needed help finding bill but she didnt need help finding all those other people she killed....... Well i dont want to tell people not to buy or see the movie only because every 1 has there own opinion in what makes a movie good but i have to say the movie was very bad......
B000148KK2|5.0|This is my first exposure to Dianna Krall, and I am amazed what a beautiful soul she has. Songs like \\"I'm Coming Through\\" and \\"Departure Bay\\" give one insight into her life and experience. In fact, the first time I heard \\"Departure Bay\\", I was moved to tears. What a beautiful song that about going home and the memories that one has about home. Her cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"Black Crow\\" is showcase of her vocal and piano talent. <br /> <br />I am looking forward to adding more of Dianna's work to my collection! <br />

This book represents the major portion of Mandelbrot's life's work without the difficult math.  It is a fun and easy read.  It is also the best book on behavioral finance to date without the psychological parlor tricks or philosophical meanderings (which DO have value BUT are virtually impossible to profitably trade) of \\"behavioral finance\\" gurus.   <br /> <br />Mandelbrot sticks to simple empirical facts that contradict the underlying assumptions of Modern Finance (especially the belief in a normal distribution of return) and offers a set of unique insights and superior tools to better understand the behavior of markets.   <br /> <br />Whatever asset class you are currently invested in (stocks, real estate, bonds, etc.) you will perceive and price risk differently after reading this book.  <br />

B000002KBA|5.0|I loved this album, but it did not blow me away in the same was as \\"Machine Head\\" did.<br /><br />\\"Speed King\\" - A good song, but it's a bit overrated. The chorus can become boring after the first few listens. Great solos from Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore. 8/10.<br /><br />\\"Bloodsucker\\" - My least favorite track. It's probably the heaviest song the album. 5/10.<br /><br />\\"Child in Time\\" - Awesome. My favorite track. It may bother some that the opening organ part is stolen from It's a Beautiful Day's \\"Bombay Calling\\" but I don't mind. Great guitar and organ work. 9.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Flight of the Rat\\" - This probably appeals to most people more than it does to me, but I still love it. 8/10.<br /><br />\\"Into the Fire\\" - A decent track. Great solos, but it's nothing special overall. 6/10.<br /><br />\\"Living Wreck\\" - Not great. Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord don't even give us the great solos that we've come to expect from them. 5.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Hard Lovin' Man\\" - An above average track. There's really not much else to say about this one. 6.5/10.<br /><br />Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord, Roger Glover, and Ian Paice all have tremendous skill with their instruments, and Ian Gillian is a great heavy metal vocalist. I highly recommend the 25th Anniversary Edition UK Import, as the bonus material saved this album from being somewhat of a disappointment for me. \\"Black Night\\", \\"Cry Free\\", and \\"Jam Stew\\" are all great songs, and the Roger Glover remixes aren't completely pointless additions as most remixes are. Don't expect the studio chat to give you insight into the personalities of the members of the band or anything, though. Most of it is just the band jamming. I wouldn't skip a single song on this album, but this is not on the same level as \\"Machine Head\\" by any means.
B00028HBKM|4.0|The film, of course, is a masterpiece.  I loved every minute of it.  My problem, however, is with the special features on the DVD.  I know that special features have become somewhat obligatory, but are bloopers really appropriate?  It seems somehow sacrilegious to show an actor getting hit below the belt in the most sacred movie ever made.  I'm as big a fan of guys getting hit in the jewels as the next guy, but save if for \\"Ernie Goes to Golgatha.\\"
B00008H2LB|1.0|Please don't state things you do not know anything about. Linkin Park have not saved metal, infact, as many people are concerned, they aren't even a metal band. They aren't even really a rock band. They are more of a pop band. Also, Linkin Park are not innovators or the pioneers of any genre. They are simply rehashing what other bands have done before. Linkin Park was not the first to blend rap with rock. Rage Against the Machine, Korn, 311, and many others did it better and before Linkin Park. Sure, I can admit that Linkin Park are successful, but does that mean they are creative? No. Their songwriting skills are severely lacking. Every single one of their songs sound exactly the same and the average garage band could write better music than Linkin Park. Their songs have a relatively simple structure; A simple syn beat, some easy drop D power chords, and a catchy chorus. Also, their lyrics are fake and void of any sort of emotion. They are the sort of thinga junior-high student would write in a notebook. But aren't the guys in Linkin Park a little older than that? You think they would've graduated to High School lyrics at least. Nope, they are content with poor writing and poor delivery. As to throwing out my metal albums, I don't think so. Linkin Parks CD's are certainly the worst in my collection, an can in no way measure up to my coveted essential albums by Opeth, Slayer, Agalloch and Decapitated.  <br /> <br />To anyone looking to buy these albums: My advice to you is graduate to a better style of music, and leave your Middle School days behind.
B00005JN2X|5.0|About a couple of weeks ago, I went to check out \\"Collateral\\" at the theater. The film was nothing short of action-packed and intense! The direction of Michael Mann (\\"Heat\\", \\"The Insider\\") was top-notch and outstanding! With its meditative aerial views of downtown street grids and rich digital-video cinematography that unites sparkle and grime into a kind of seedy nocturnal poetry, \\"Collateral\\" is one of the best-looking modern noirs that you'll see. It could be a corollary to another modern noir and Mann's best film, the epic crime story \\"Heat\\" -- a more modest, more arty riff on L.A.'s underside and on the juxtaposition of straight and criminal leads. The performance of Tom Cruise (\\"The Last Samurai\\"), offering a change of pace for his role as a ruthless killer, was nothing short of intense! It's impossible to take your eyes off of Cruise for a second! The performance of Jamie Foxx (\\"Any Given Sunday\\") was nothing short of excellent! Joining them are Jada Pinkett Smith (The \\"Matrix\\" films), Mark Ruffalo (\\"13 Going on 30\\"), Peter Berg (\\"Cop Land\\"), and Bruce McGill (\\"Runaway Jury\\") in which they gave great performances as well. <br /> <br />The film pairs a fast-talking, hired assassin named Vincent (Cruise) in town for one night with a cabbie named Max (Foxx) on the night shift. Vincent arrives in the city late with orders to knock off five people involved in a drug-trafficking trial set to start the next morning. After being impressed with Max's knowledge of L.A. shortcuts and traffic patterns en route to his first hit, Vincent hires Max to be his driver for the night, securing his services first with a handful of hundred dollar bills and later, when Max knows what Vincent is up to, through threat of violence. <br /> <br />As the cabbie, Jamie Foxx continues his perhaps unlikely rise from sitcom celeb to A-list actor, though it's easy to imagine dozens of other actors inhabiting the same role just as well. Appealing supporting players Mark Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett Smith are fine, if perhaps underused. But the real attraction here is Tom Cruise, and for a director who has worked with such high-wattage actors as Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Russell Crowe, Daniel Day-Lewis, and even William Petersen (who gave an intense, moody performance in Mann's 1986 film, \\"Manhunter\\", the superior precursor to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\"), Cruise seems a little too plain -- a little too dull -- for a Mann protagonist. But clearly, Cruise's own image is at work here, with Mann playing off Cruise's unflappable persona and trying to get dramatic mileage by having the actor play against type as a ruthless bad guy. (A scene in a jazz club is a set piece to show off the depths of Vincent's heartlessness and Cruise's bravery.) Cruise's Vincent certainly makes for a compelling visual, his silver hair and gray stubble matching his shiny, shark-colored suit to form the image of a hit man as walking handgun. Cruise is as watchable as ever, but his Vincent is too much the cipher. His line readings are so practice-perfect that Vincent could be as easily be a Cruise hero from any of the actor's other action movies. <br /> <br />In conclusion, \\"Collateral\\" has the makings of a gritty, action-packed thriller with suspense at every twist and turn. Under the direction of an industry hack like Joel Schumacher or Brett Ratner, \\"Collateral\\" might have ranged from unwatchable to instantly forgettable. But luckily for us, Michael Mann gives it enough soul and visual verve to make it worth seeing, which is a not-inconsiderable feat. But ultimately, \\"Collateral\\" might be just another Hollywood star vehicle. Without a doubt, \\"Collateral\\" is a DVD must-own for your collection!

0060575913|5.0|I began reading this story to my seven year old son and his five year old friend, during a sleep over that tended to not involve sleep.  Yes the subject matter can be scary, but both boys have an incredible immagination that the story fit well in to.   <br />My son could not wait to hear more about Coraline at bedtime, and unfortunately the story is now over.  However, in the process I am now able to read to my son in bed (he has lately been prefering to read to himself) and his excited retelling of the story to other friends has created a waiting list for others to borrow the book. <br />As a guidline, if your child enjoyed the movie Spirited Away, or likes stories that have chapters with big cliff hangers at the end of each chapter, this story will fit in well.  Also, check out Gaiman's illustrated Wolves in the Walls to get an idea of the writting style (or for yourself, the Sandman series).
B00005JNEI|5.0|We may be used to \\"balanced\\" and 'fair' documentaries, and this Michael Moore film certainly isn't balanced. But it is legitimate because it is 'the case for the prosecution'. Instead of just whinging about it, you right wingers should make the case for the defense. Where is the reply? The Bush machine has nothing to say, and its apologists do nothing but make personal attacks on Michael Moore. That is like criticising the lawyer - and it's not getting you anywhere in the court of world opinion. I judge this film has got close to the truth.

0684833395|5.0|The phrase &#34;Catch-22&#34; didn't exist until this book coined it in 1961. The author, Joseph Heller inadvertently added it to the English language when he used it to describe an American regulation governing pilot's required number of combat missions.<br /><br />The rule was this: Pilots could only be grounded if they were insane; however they had to request this.  But - asking to be grounded proved you sane and so there was no escape, and this was known as Catch-22.<br /><br />This simple problem becomes a metaphor for all that goes on in this novel and correspondingly, in virtually any warfare. The book is bitingly funny, filled with tragic incidents and is chaotic, much like war.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the lives of a group of American bomber pilots in World War II.  The central character is Yossarian, who we first met in hospital. The book details events form his life in a seemingly random order, in some ways similar to Kurt Vonnegut's, &#34;Slaughterhouse Five&#34; where an American soldier becomes &#34;unstuck in time.&#34; In Heller's case, this isn't as blatant and you see the order is in fact carefully constructed to build towards a climax.<br /><br />Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else. Then there is the newly promoted Major Major, who once promoted, becomes Major Major Major and then spends most of the war trying to hide from his men.<br /><br />Each of the unique and colorful characters adds a bit to the pastiche of moods and attitudes deftly displayed here. Absurdities run through the book such as when Doc Daneeka was supposedly killed when the plane he was in crashed...he wasn't killed since he always avoided flying, but in the US Air Force, once it's in the paperwork, it's a done deal...so there's no going back - to everyone else, including his misinformed wife, he remains dead - no discussion.<br /><br />It's a simple idea to posit that war is absurd but it takes a clever writer to illustrate through the actions and  of his characters. Catch-22 is the kind of novel that welcomes a second and third read and is highly recommended.kes a clever writer to illustrate through the actions and  of his characters.

0156027321|5.0|Were Yann Martel's \\"Life of Pi\\" not awarded with the Man Booker Prize for fiction it would not be such a bestseller it is. To begin with this is not your usual book of the month --this is a complicated narrative filled with symbols and metaphors. The main characters are an Indian boy and a Bengal tiger, hence there isn't much dialogue between them what makes the novel more difficult. And the top of the odds the main theme turns out to be God and Religion.<br /><br />So why are many readers willing to read this book? I think that because it tackles with a subject that interests everyone: existence. Telling the story of Pi, Martel managed to dive deep in the existential question that surrounds everyone. But he does that without being didactically boring --this, after all, is just a story, and this writer is a good storyteller.<br /><br />All characters --whether human or animal --are beautifully developed, and Pi's family is a joy. His father walk in the zoo with his tow sons is one of my favorite moments of this novel. However much difficult it would be for Martel to develop the animal's identity, he overcomes this `problem' giving each animal a distinguished personality of its own.<br /><br />Dealing with a complex theme like religion, Martel would have fallen into a boring speech of giving lectures about each religion. But this is not the case. The way the novel is written it gives room for explanation --without giving a lecture. The theme is dealt with easy, beauty and, above all, respect. This is bravura of a book. Not many writers would dare to write about such theme with so much confidence and courage.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is not an easy novel -- many may feel tempted to give it up, but those who stick with it will not regret in the end. In the last pages when Pi reaches his destination, the reader fells at easy and is able to see life in another better way --not many novels have such quality.
B00005JN2F|2.0|Right off the bat I want to say that the story line and the acting in this film are both very good. If you liked the first BOURNE movie, you will like this one. HOWEVER, the director shouldbe fired and told to return his paycheck for what his did in post-production. It's like the director said to the camera man, \\"OK, the fight is starting so START SHAKING THE CAMERA!!!\\" \\"OK, the chase is starting so START SHAKING THE CAMERA!!\\" What should have been thrilling chases and fights were so jiggly and out of focus that I almost got seasick, seriously! I think a wonderful movie with wonderful acting got the short end of the stick with this director. I would like to see a third movie in the series with a director who actually shows the audience what is happening instead of making us feel like we are watching it from inside a running dryer. Good try, hoping for better next time.

0765301598|2.0|Having read the two previous (and all other Dune) books, this was disappointing.  The characters were more one-dimensional than in the two previous books, the motivations simplistic, the plot less complex and more obviously contrived and directed toward the needed ending.  Perhaps most symbolic, there was an unforgiveable error in the year dating the first part of the book;  while it should have been printed as 107 B.G., it was written as 69 B.G.  This is representative of the thin, poorly thought out nature of the book.
B00005JNEI|4.0|From the reviews I've read so far it's obvious to see how polarized views on this film -and current American discourse for that matter- are. Yet it is hard to talk about it without revealing one's own feelings about the war.<br /><br />Overall the film was well done, both in content and structure. And contrary to what the reviews written here by the right-wing sympathizers  (consisting usually of one paragraph and saying nothing substantive about the movie-just ad hominem attacks against Moore) there are no lies in this movie. Moore himself has said he thought about offering $10,000 to anyone who finds anything factually wrong in it, yet some in the right love to bash it. Ironic, since the reasons this administration used for taking the US to war have been proven inaccurate -to say the least-, but the \\"Party of Self-Responsibility\\" does not seem to admit to them. I'm willing to bet that most of these reviewers who give the movie one star have not even watched it.<br /><br />What the movie contains however, is a string of selective facts that Moore can be very manipulative in using. A good example is the footage of Iraqi civilians on the eve of the war; children flying kites, happy families,  followed by... the attacks. This is followed by scenes of mayhem and death, and one particularly heartbreaking scene of a bloody baby wailing while being carried to a hospital (that scene still haunts me). This was an undeniable part of the war, this really happened, and Moore elicits from the audience the response he intended. Yet as I watched this, I thought that if instead of those scenes he had chosen footage of Saddam's<br /> torture houses, children being tortured in front of their parents, wives being raped in front of their husbands and children, then the response to the bombing from the audience would have been a very different one. This was part of the war too.<br /><br />Further, while I believe there was foul play in the 2000 elections, I would not go as far as Moore. And seriously, can anyone say with a straight face that the last name Bush HAD NOTHING TO DO with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of junior? Yet Moore builds up this case in a way that makes it seem as a watertight conspiracy theory, when in reality it was many people, at many levels of government, putting aside objectivity and integrity and ruling out on partisan allegiance, not unlike a struggling democracy elsewhere. Moore does show an amazing amount of papers and concrete proof to base his argument on, but again, one is left feeling that it could not be so \\"perfect\\" as Moore would have you believe.<br /><br />The documentary does articulate the outrage of many people who feel we were taken to war for dubious reasons, and then it turned out that those reasons were downright wrong. Right now American credibility around the world is zero, and half the people in this country feel the same way about the Bush administration. Moore's intention with this movie is to keep Bush for winning office again, which is in my view a necessary step for our own survival and to signal the rest of the world that this country does not approve of the lies we have been fed. If re-elected, we will be seen as co-conspirators and American reputation will sink even deeper. Although this reader needs no convincing, Moore's film makes the case even more persuasive.<br />In the end if Michael Moore hates America or not only he must know; but raising a mirror to America's face is probably the most patriotic you can do right now.<br /><br />Fahrenheit 9/11 ends with a thought that should be given nothing but respect and approval from the audience; \\"Our young men and women put themselves on the line and ask that we only put them in harm's way when absolutely necessary.\\" How some people can say they agree while at the same time still support what Bush has done -all evidence against him- is to live a contradiction. Yes, Saddam Hussein was the scum of the earth and his sons and cronies were no better, but this was not our war to fight. If the reasons for taking us to war were to \\"bring the gift of freedom from the Almighty\\" to Iraq or oil or strategic security or whatever, accusations of WMDs and imaginary links to al quaeda do not justify it. That the people who did everything possible not to serve in uniform when it was their duty, are the ones who now so carelessly take us to war, is nothing less than a tragedy.If the reasons for taking us to war were to \\"bring the gift of freedom from the Almighty\\" to Iraq or oil or strategic security or whatever, accusations of WMDs and imaginary links to al quaeda do not justify it.

I was saddened by the fact that a thread could not be continued for more than a chapter.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is the album Bob Dylan must have been spending the last 25 years creating.  Not to take anything away from Oh Mercy and Time Out Of Mind, both are great studio albums with arguably some of Dylan's most well written songs, but Lanois' fingerprints on these recordings are undeniable and the songs are left with a dark and atmospheric sound.   <br /> <br />  Listening to Love and Theft for the first time is an exhiliarting experience.  Gone are all the layers of production and Dylan, under the acronym Jack Frost, has produced one of the crown jewels in his large body of music.  Dylan and his band have basically condensed the history of American music into one album.  Love and Theft contains rustic folk music, tin-pan alley ballads, hard rocking blues, and even jump swing.   <br /> <br />  Dylan and his band play the songs with energy and intensity that only a band that has played live together for years can produce.  The lyrics of Love and Theft may not be Dylan's most poignant but the tradeoff is well worth it. <br /> <br />  After listening to Love and Theft, one gets the feeling that this is a culmination of years and years of Dylan trying different musical styles and finally melding them into one album.  Love and Theft is American Music 101.
0688170528|4.0|When I first picked up \\"The Pact\\", I was a bit skeptical.  The book had been made into a Lifetime network film, so I was a little bit worried that the book might read like a script from a B-movie.  I almost put the book down after the first scene in the Chinese restaurant because the dialog seemed to be something right out of a movie of the week.  Although I've never seen the Lifetime movie, I suspect that this scene is included in the film. <br /> <br />Fortunately, I had the good sense to read beyond the first scene.  The characters in this book, particularly Emily and Chris, will stay with you for days.  I still get teary about Emily because suicide was not her only option.  It never is!  Several times I felt myself almost yelling at the Emily character to reach out for help.  Although I've never been suicidal or gone through situations like Emily's (I don't want to spoil anything to future readers by giving out too much information), I really related to her.  I remember being a confused 17-year old too.   <br /> <br />I liked Chris, but I can't comprehend why he chose to do what he did.  Still, the character was likeable and I genuinely cared about what happened to him. <br /> <br />As a parent of a young child, I found this book hit me close in the heart.  Just afer finishing the book, I made certain to tell my child how much I love her and that she should know that I am always there for her, no matter what.   <br /> <br />

All this DVD includes is a theatrical trailer! What a joke. Such a great film, and not that old, and they couldnt even include a single commentary or interview. Also, the nudidty could have been cut out and perhaps kids could have been able to see it with a PG rating.... anyways... Good movie, BAD DVD
0316168815|1.0|Inexplicably, this book sold like 85 bazillion copies. I read it quickly because I wanted to get it over with. Although I admit the writing is better, this book lives somewhere between Christopher Pike (whose books I loved--when I was 13!) and The Celestine Prophesy, which is probably my all-time least favorite book. This story is told from the point of view of a dead girl. I wish she had just stayed dead and not bothered to tell us a story.
1400082773|4.0|U.S. Senate hopeful Barack Obama has an inspiring story to share, and yet he doesn't simply rest on his laurels in this critical evaluation of his life and in his continuing search for himself as a black American. He wrote \\"Dreams From My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance\\" almost ten years ago, but his stock has obviously surged since his star-making speech at the Democratic National Convention last month, perhaps to the chagrin of Hillary Clinton...unless she is dreaming of a Clinton-Obama ticket in 2008! Growing up mulatto in Hawaii and Indonesia, Obama discusses trying to come to grips with his racial identity through a period of rebellion that included drug use, becoming a community activist in Chicago and traveling to Kenya to understand his father's past. It is in Kenya where he discovers a nation with forty different tribes, each of them saddled with stereotypes of the others. It is also in Kenya where he recognizes the dichotomy that has been his lifelong existence between the graves of his father and his grandfather. His description of this defining moment is worthy of a passage in Alex Haley's \\"Roots\\".<br /><br />Obama is also candid about racism, poverty and corruption in Chicago, and he pulls no punches in his account of this period. Because the book stops in 1995, it does not get into much detail on his learning experiences, culminating in both missteps and triumphs, as a state legislator.  For all the value the book provides on Obama's history, I would have appreciated a more substantive update than the preface on the last decade, as he gained political prominence in Illinois, so that we understand more why his time in the spotlight has come at this moment. Perhaps that will be Volume 2. I was also disappointed he spent so little time writing about his mother and the influence her side of the family has had on him, a narrative gap Obama acknowledges and over which he expresses regret in the preface. Perhaps inclusion of such details would have made for a less compelling story from his originally intended Afro-centric perspective; but at the same time, I think a more balanced look at his own racial dichotomy would have made his story resonate all the more given where he is now.<br /><br />Obama is open in the preface about using changed names and composite characters to expedite the flow and ensure privacy of those around him, but it does somewhat lessen the impact of his story when one starts to wonder who was real and who was a fictionalized character. Regardless of these literary devices, this book is still a very worthwhile look into the background of someone who is on a major upward trajectory in the current national political scene.less compelling story from his originally intended Afro-centric perspective; but at the same time, I think a more balanced look at his own racial dichotomy would have made his story resonate all the more given where he is now.

0743455967|4.0|Had I not been given this book as a gift, I would never have read it. And I would have missed out. For some reason, despite that he's sold more books than anyone, I always considered King a horror writer, never a writer writer. But the advice he gives is great advice. Not intending to write a comprehensive book about the tricks of the trade, he gives his highlights. The biggest things to focus on in writing. And he gives examples from his own work, how he learned the lesson. I learned more from On Writing than many of the writing workshops I've taken. More importantly, it gave me the shot of motivation I need from time to time. King's views get a little preachy at times, a little grumpy-old-man-ish (like when he says to stop wasting time watching TV), but I appreciate it. He, if anyone, has a right to say what he thinks.
B0001AP12G|5.0|After listening to this cd over and over, all I can say is that the music and lyrics are excellent.  Each song is different from the other one and Kanye West has a nice delivery.  I can't pick a favorite since I like all of the songs on this album, specially \\"Jesus Walks\\", \\"All Falls Down\\", \\"Never Let Me Down\\", \\"Get em High\\" and \\"Two Words\\".  I recommend you buy this cd. You won't be disappointed.
0684833395|5.0|It seems silly to be reviewing classics on their literary merit. Obviously, if a book's a classic, its merits have been trumpeted by much more qualified readers than myself. But I can always comment, perhaps especially when it comes to classics, on whether or not a book is enjoyable. Catch-22 is a very enjoyable classic. Some of the cleverest writing I've read. And clever in a good way, not just to be clever. Sarcastic before it was cool, outlandish, funny enough to make the serious stuff sting and serious enough (gut-wrenching at times) to make the funny stuff refreshing. Wonderful characters. And a portrayal of the idiosyncrasies of the Army that anyone who's ever been part of a large organization can relate to.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|This DVD is one of the essentials, if you like musicals.  The songs are familiar, the dance numbers good, and Carol Burnett was great.  My biggest beef with the DVD is that it is only available in full-screen format.  You can tell that the viewing area is cut back with this format, the studio should do the right thing and release a widescreen version.

Tuesday's is accessable to all, because we essentially all are the wonderful world we are mingling with.  The author seems to envelop much of the questions and concerns that current generations have, while Morrie creates a platform of wisdom and discovery. <br />Enjoy.

B00005JLF5|1.0|The Original Series had it all.  Then came The Next Generation, and we were treated to wooden characters and technobabble solutions to technobabble problems.  Then came DS9.  They fixed the problem with the wooden characters - they made the characters completely unlikable.  Sisko reads his lines like a man leaving the outgoing message on an answering machine, as if he's going to say \\"Oh, no, wait, let me do that again.\\" at the end of each line.  Kira is awful, one of the more pompous and obnoxious characters in a Trek universe full of pomposity and obnoxiousness.  Then there's Quark, a goofy looking screwball who is supposed to represent all that is so terrible and evil about capitalism.  Yes boys and girls, get in line to have Rodenberry's socialist dogma pounded into your skulls with all the subtelty of a photon torpedo.  And last and least, Odo, another unlikable character. <br /> <br />Actually, the show did have a few good characters.  Chief O'Brien was quite good, as was his wife.  Okay, that about covers it. <br /> <br />If you want something that's pompous, preachy, poorly acted, HORRIBLY directed, and features some humor that can only make you pity the people have to say the lines, then this is the motherlode. <br /> <br />But, at least it was better than Voyager.

B00008G1WD|4.0|This film, directed by the legendary John Ford and starring John Wayne in the leading role, is a western that has achieved mythic proportions. Touted as one of the greatest westerns ever filmed, it is, I will grant you, an entertaining film. In it, John Wayne plays the anti-hero, Ethan Edwards, an ex-confederate soldier, who goes to Texas in 1868 to visit his brother and his family on their ranch. While visiting, a report of marauding Indians in adjacent land draws out the Texas Rangers, and Ethan joins them. When they discover that a decoy has been used to lure them away from the settlement, they hurry back, only to find that Ethan's family was massacred and his two nieces gone, taken captive by Comanche Indians.<br /><br />Ethan goes to the rescue, joined by Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a friend of the family who is himself part Indian. After a while, they discover that only the younger niece, Debbie, has survived. Their quest to bring Debbie back, or so Martin thinks, takes place over a period of five years. At some point along the way, Ethan's relentless quest for Debbie seems to undergo a transition from rescue mission to execution squad in the belief that it is better to be dead than to have \\"gone Injun\\".<br /><br />The film suffers somewhat from revisionist history and its own stereotypic portrayal of Indians. They are portrayed as either savages or buffoons fit only to be the butt of jokes. Moreover, the character of Ethan is an enigma, as he changes from heartbroken uncle to death squad killer in his relentless search for his surviving niece. Ethan embodies hatred and racism, concepts that are tantalizingly laid out but never fully examined or explored, which is why Ethan remains an enigma.<br /><br />Debbie, played as a child by Lana Wood and as a teenager by Lana's older sister, Natalie Wood, is a symbol from whom Ethan's character gets its raison d'etre. It is she who gives him the will to go on, whether it be for the right or wrong reasons is another issue. Natalie Wood is lovely as the older Debbie, though the makeup has to go, as it serves to take away from the rusticity of the film and jerk the viewer back to Hollywood. This was typical of films in those days. No matter what the situation, the women were always in full makeup.<br /><br />Still, notwithstanding some of the film's political incorrectness and incongruent production values, it is still an entertaining film and about as good as westerns get. John Wayne is memorable as Ethan Edwards. Handsome Jeffrey Hunter gives an excellent performance as Martin Pawley. Ward Bond, as captain of the Texas Rangers, is terrific. The rest of the supporting cast give performances that vary in quality. Still, this film remains the quintessential western flick and one worth watching.issue.

B0002I831S|5.0|It's ironic that a ratings failure gave birth to eight movies and four series, spawned the concept of a \\"franchise\\" in the TV world and numerous spin offs. Without \\"Star Trek\\" it's unlikely that we'd have gotten \\"Star Wars\\" or the explosion of science fiction movies and TV shows that have dotted the media since then. In the 1960's the year 2265 looked quite a bit different than the current crop of Trek shows and movies. Unlike later Trek series, \\"The Original Series\\" focused as much on the adventure element as the vague science. It's what sets the original apart from the technobattle of later series where the science of an episode could drive the action and also average viewers batty. When creator Gene Roddenberry first proposed  \\"Wagon Train to the Stars\\" there had been only two series that successfully put science fiction on the screen-\\"The Twilight Zone\\" and \\"The Outer Limits\\". Both series were anthology series with only the former a big ratings success. So Rodenberry's idea was a novel concept at the time. Many people contributed to the success of Roddenberry's original vision adding elements that have carried over to the current shows. The only question that remains for me after watching the numerous is how do they put on their shirts when they zip from the side and the back?<br /><br /> Using the same digital masters as those for the previous releases (which were remastered for the Sci-Fi Channel debut), the image quality is extraordinary considering the age of the series and grain caused by the optical effects. There's minimal analog blemishes due to the use of digital filtering effects. The colors are remarkably vivid and bright highlighting designer Matt Jefferies unusual color schemes for the bridge, sets and costumes. It's so good looking that you can even see what looks like a metal stud hanging on one of the rocks for the second pilot episode. Is it perfect looking? No but Paramount has done a terrific job of restoring the images and pumping up the original mono sound. There are analog flaws in the soundtrack on occasion including most prominently on \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\"<br /><br />Thanks Paramount for including a booklet with a brief summary of each episode. This is something that should have been done from the beginning with \\"The Next Generation\\" boxed sets. The packaging, although not truly an extra, is a huge improvement over \\"Voyager\\" and comparable to the sturdy boxes for \\"The Next Generation\\". With its plastic clam shell yellow container, the box for this set makes this one of the best designed I've come across. The interactive animated menu is also outstanding and imaginatively done.<br /><br /> There's five featurettes on the series with interviews from the actors, writers and surviving production crew. \\"Sci-Fi Visionaries\\" looks at how Roddenberry's approach of mixing established science fiction writers with established TV writers made the show unique (much as \\"The Twilight Zone\\" and \\"The Outer Limits\\" did with their writers). Actors William Shatner , Leonard Nimoy , George Takei, William Campbell, Richardo Montalban & and producers John D. F. Black & Robert Justman along with story editor/writer D. C. Fontana are interviewed for the featurettes giving a nice background on the nuts and bolts of producing the series. Again, nasty stories are avoided so for those looking for dirt, it ain't here.<br /><br />\\"To Boldly Go...\\" reflects on the first season of the show including the difficulties that Roddenberry and his production crew had meeting deadlines because of the extensive visual effects, editing and music effects that were necessary for the show. As Associate Producer Robert Justman accurately points out, the average TV series never had that disadvantage. Shatner & Nimoy reflect on the strong writing quality of the series and how that made the difference in selling it as a serious program.<br /><br />\\"The Birth of a Timeless Legacy\\" features interviews from 1988 where Roddenberry discusses the birth of his creation. Justman, Shatner and Nimoy discuss the difficulty in selling the networks on the show. CBS rejected it because they felt they already had their token science fiction series with \\"Lost in Space\\". That series created by Irwin Allen actually had a strong first season before degenerating into parody and comedy. NBC bought the series with some doubts. Seeing the first pilot featuring actor Jeffrey Hunter (\\"King of Kings\\")as Captain Christopher Pike NBC felt that Roddenberry's script was too intellectual. They also wanted Nimoy's ears dispensed with at first.  Roddenberry asked friend Samuel Peeples to write the second pilot with a more action oriented approach. We get the background on both from Roddenberry again and Justman/<br /><br />\\"Reflections on Spock\\" features Nimoy discussing the development of his character and how it impacted on his career. \\"Life Beyond Trek: William Shatner\\" focuses on  Shatner's love of horses, horsepacking riding and competition. We get a peak of Shatner's ranch, footage of him riding and demonstrating a wide variety of riding techniques. We also get a number of Easter Eggs scattered throughout the set. Look for the \\"red alert\\" light and you'll find a couple of short featurettes that focuses on background on a couple of memorable episodes.  The only thing missing from this set is a featurette on line producer Gene L. Coon. Coon helped Roddenberry develop many of the first season episodes and was a tremendously talented writer/producer who had won a number of Emmy Awards for his work. While Coon only worked on the first two seasons (coming on board after the first two pilots had been shot) of the series, his influence as a writer and producer extended far beyond that. Hopefully Coon will be highlighted in one of the upcoming sets. The original upcoming TV promotional trailers are included here just as they were on the first dual episode sets released a couple of years ago. Finally, we get a photo log with behind the scenes pictures from the series and some of the publicity shots for the show as well.<br /><br />While there isn't any audio commentary, we do get a quartet of fact packed text commentaries from Michael and Denise Okuda. Both have contributed to a number of previous Trek releases including the recent \\"Voyager\\" boxed set and the \\"Special Editions\\" of the motion pictures. The three episodes that have commentary are the \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", \\"The Conscience of the King\\" and the two part episode \\"The Menagerie\\" (which incorporated the story and footage from the original pilot and also won the Hugo for Best Science Fiction Program in 1967).<br /><br /> A great job in packaging the first season of \\"The Original Series\\", \\"Star Trek\\" finally gets the treatment and respect it deserves in this DVD boxed set. The outstanding featurettes, text commentary and image quality make this an essential purchase for Trek fans. Paramount also does a terrific job with the packaging.

B0002W4SWC|5.0|I saw this movie, kicking and screaming, when my younger sister foisted it upon me. Thinking that it was going to be another Gen X piece of claptrap, I gritted my teeth and prepared myself for what I erroneously thought would be a waste of time. Was I ever wrong! It turned out to be a sublime cinematic experience.<br /><br />Renee Zellweger is definitely the star of this film. She positively twinkles! She is absolutely marvelous in the role of Bridget Jones, our single, thirty something, English Holly-Go-Lightly. Employed as a somewhat graceless publicist, the plump and perky Bridget enters into an affair with her caddish, handsome, sexy boss, winningly played by the ever charming and debonair Hugh Grant.<br /><br />Meanwhile, her mother has introduced her to an attorney, the stiff-necked Mr. Darcy, played to taciturn perfection by Colin Firth. Even though they were once childhood playmates, he and Bridget do not initially click, and it is not love at first sight, as Bridget's mother had so hoped. Bridget goes on her merry way with her boss, unaware that he is two-timing her. When she discovers his perfidy, it is too late, as she already fancies herself in love with him.<br /><br />Mr. Darcy, however, re-enters the picture, and what happens is a thing of beauty to watch. The film is very funny. Rene Zellweger as a Brit is totally believable. She is so good that she would even fool the Queen into believing her to be one of the Queen's own subjects. Without a doubt, this is one of Ms. Zellweger's best roles to date, and she is positively delightful. Moreover, Sharon Maguire's directorial debut is certainly noteworthy, as she shows signs of a deft comedic touch in her direction. This is simply a terrific film. Bravo!
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|I have been a Green Day fan for a while, and I've listened to all their music.  If this single is any indication of the full-length album, American Idiot will be better than anything that they've done before, including Dookie.  The title track is another masterpiece by the great Billie Joe Armstrong.  Even after 15 years of writing songs, this guy just isn't showing any signs of slowing down.  The second track, Too Much Too Soon is a non-album track but is still good enough to make another band's greatest hits collection.  This was the first Green Day CD that has a parental advisory sticker, but I don't think it's really warrented; there's only a few curses.  For only 3 bucks, this single is a steal.
B00008G8M4|5.0|This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.<br /><br />The quality of this two disc DVD is superlative with crystal clear visuals and great sound quality. The letterbox format offers both the theatrical release version and the special edition version from which to choose. The special edition version offers an extra nine minutes of restored footage. The second disc offers a myriad of features, including an interesting thirty minute documentary on the making of the film.

B00006SFLV|4.0|In responce to the \\"Thirtysomething\\" review...This show was diffrent than the other teen shows that aired in the 90's.  I would hardly concider the characters as almost-privlaged.  This show talks about real issues that relate to teen life; sex, drugs, alcoholism, and abuse.  The characters are hardly \\"token\\".  This show was more realilistic than others (90210 for example).  It was a normal show with normalish (hey it's still television) teens dealing with normal problem.  And concidering the lack of gay characters on mainstream television at the time, I would hardly concider Ricky \\"the stereotypical gay guy\\" the fact that the character chose to wear make-up doesn't necissarily make him a sterotype.  Before characterizing the characters as \\"token\\" you really need to go back to when the show was first aired on television, times were diffrent then and having a guy (openly or otherwise) was not a common sight to see. <br /> <br />All in all I thought the series was a good depiction of teen life, the issues that teens face today are the same as they were in the 90's when this show first aired.
0767843789|5.0|This gritty and grim mob flick, deftly directed by Mike Newell, is based upon the true story of FBI undercover agent, Joe Pistone, who as his alter ego \\"Donnie Brasco\\" infiltrated the mob for a number of years, resulting in its eventual decimation. So artfully did the real Joe Pistone infiltrate and so well did he do his job, that he and his family were obliged to enter the witness protection program for their safety, as a contract was ultimately put out on Joe Pistone's life.<br /><br />Here, Johnny Depp plays the role of Joe Pistone/Donnie Brasco. He is terrific in the role, and the viewer watches him become absorbed by the lifestyle of the mobsters with whom he associates. He is befriended by \\"Lefty\\" Ruggierro, artfully played Al Pacino. Shifty and common, \\"Lefty\\" typifies your low level made guy, the guy on the fringes doing the dirty work, a real bottom feeder. He is the guy who does the hits, and he is the guy the higher ups look to whack when something goes wrong. It is not an enviable or glamorous life, as has been made out by other films, such as the \\"Godfather\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\". The existence of \\"Lefty\\" and the legions like him is gritty and grim, always a bridesmaid and never a bride.<br /><br />\\"Lefty\\" takes Brasco under his wing and vouches for him. He shows Brasco the ABCs of becoming a \\"made\\" guy. \\"Lefty\\" himself wants to move up in the mob hierarchy. It soon becomes painfully obvious that that ain't gonna happen. One cannot help feel a little sorry for \\"Lefty\\", so limited is his worldview and so at the mercy of others. Still, \\"Lefty\\" gives Donnie some invaluable lessons on mob etiquette. He also unburdens himself to Donnie, treating him as if he were his adopted son. The bond between the two men grows. As this happens, Donnie finds himself being pulled more and more into the world of mobsters, until his old and new realities begin to merge.<br /><br />As he distances himself from his wife (Anne Heche) and family, Brasco is thrust into a maelstrom of mob violence that threatens to tear him apart and consume him. He tries to get \\"Lefty\\" to go straight and retire, in hope of avoiding his betrayal. It is to no avail. Brasco, in for a penny, in for a pound, now stands to become a \\"made\\" guy himself. It is only at the eleventh hour that an intervention set up by the FBI plays itself out, setting up the betrayal of \\"Lefty\\". It is a sad moment for Brasco, as he knows that \\"Lefty\\" has just been handed a death sentence at the hands of the mob for vouching for an FBI agent. It is Brasco's ultimate salvation, however, as he was on the brink of committing an unpardonable act, one in which he would have crossed the line and from which there would have been no turning back. It is a decision that was, luckily for him, taken out of his hands.<br /><br />Al Pacino gives the defining, superlative performance in this film. Anne Heche is sensational as the put upon, concerned wife, who watches her husband change into someone she can barely recognize. Johnny Depp, likewise, gives a stellar performance as the angst ridden FBI undercover agent. All in all, a terrific film with a stellar cast and well worth having in one's collection.mob violence that threatens to tear him apart and consume him.

B0000A118M|5.0|This album may serve as an acid test - if you don't like it, you don't like jazz, and never will. The flawless interplay of the four voices in this work builds upon all that came before and anticipates all that came after. Those who don't like it - and these are few an far between - are usually aggressively drowsy conservatives who listen to Coltrane wishing listfully that his genius had not arrived on the scene to disturb the sanguine haze that was American music in the late 50's. A Love Supreme created a new musical idiom in which the depth of human sentiment could be commiunicated. A towering accomplishment.
B0002OOUP0|4.0|OK OK OK... no \\"Shattered\\", \\"She's So Cold\\" or \\"One Hit to the Body\\"... <br />But overall this is a good summary of almost 2 and a half decades(!). Man! 22 years summed up on one disc; and yet, it took four discs, 'Hot Rocks' and 'More Hot Rocks' to sum up their 1964-1971 output. That's saying something. As such \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Brown Sugar\\" coulda been left off 'Jump Back'. <br />The only embarrassing song on here is \\"Hot Stuff\\"; fake reggae. Blech. Never heard \\"Respectable\\" before, but, man, what a fine rave up! Keith just wears his Chuck Berry influence on his sleeve with this song. Wish the Stones could still rip one like this more often. <br />As for the rest, good stuff, but upon closer listen I was amazed how self parodic Mick became. \\"Fool to Cry\\" has a great arrangement, but Mick's vocals are cringe inducing. Mick, you're not black, you never will be, so stop trying (plus the day Mick has a woman living on the po' side of town the weather in hell will get mighty chilly)!  <br />When I was a young un I thought \\"Emotional Rescue\\" was the coolest song; now it's just hilarious and not in a good way. But that \\"knight in shining armor\\" rap still makes me smile. <br />My advice: buy this compliation, 'Hot Rocks', and 'More Hot Rocks', and you'll have a fine representation of their output. Avoid '40 licks'. You'll thank me!
B00008DDXC|5.0|Okay this movie is a must see. It has a much tighter plot than the first one and the story is edgier and darker too. It didn't feel like 2 and a half hours of watching a flick. JK's imagination combined with high-budget effects certainly made the experience magical. Everything was exactly how i imagined it to be while reading the books. One thing I want to commend is the faithfulness of this movie. Almost everthing was perfectly identical to the published work. Thats the best part.
B0002IU988|5.0|I was slightly hesitant to purchase this album when it debuted. I flopped back and forth in a span of a week after it's release, debating if I should buy it or not. Eventually, I did.  <br /> <br />Simply put, this is one of the best musical decisions I ever made. <br /> <br />Alter Bridge, while certainly a new band, does not have a hollow or pop-driven sound. There rock style brings the listener down to earth. After giving this album a listen through, you'll quickly feel how the album flows from emotional highs to lows and back again. You will also find your favorite on the first listen through. Everyone's favorite is different. <br /> <br />In my opinion, and from what I've heard of others, \\"In Loving Memory\\" is perhaps one of the greatest songs in the modern rock era. Definitely placing in my top 5 greatest songs ever, \\"In Loving Memory\\" is full of passion and grace. Myles Kennedy opens every verse and chorus of this song with romantic power and focus. From start to end, you will feel this song.  <br /> <br />This isn't to say the rest of the album doesn't rock. \\"Broken Wings\\" will touch your heart as well. \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is a solid song of compassion. \\"Shed My Skin\\" makes you want to look at those who have mocked you in the past and say \\"Look at me. I made it after all!\\" There isn't a single bad song on this album. <br /> <br />Don't wait any longer to buy this album. You will not regret it. For those of you mentioning Creed in the same sentence, just stop. Creed and Alter Bridge are two different stylings. Enjoy what you hear on this album and don't buy into hype or bad press.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I went and saw the movie at the theater and I loved it, I could not wait till it came out on dvd, but now here I am still waiting.  Why?  Because while every one else will rave about Gibson's marketing I think he made one of the sneakiest underhanded moves known to Hollywood.  Mel released the dvd with no special features at all, not even a director commentary. Why?  Because he thinks it will sell without it (and probably will), and then when every copy has sold, a year or two later he will release the \\"Special Edition\\" and make even more money.  Trying to get every Christian on the face of the planet to spend as much money on you, well that doesn't sound very Christian does it.  So now maybe I will boycot it, and if he's lucky maye some day I will forget how mad I was at his marketing and buy it... I don't know.  But Mel, here are some tips for you: <br />1) Special Features are not special anymore they are common, hopefully you will loose money for this <br />2) While obviously you know the last 12 hours of Christ's life you have forgotten the rest or just ignore it.  Trying to suck every last cent from a Christian's pocket isn't very Christian <br />3) If you ask your preacher, maybe he will remind you of something Jesus said about how hard it would be for the rich to get past the front gates in Heaven. Something about the eye of a needle.  And here is you not only very well off, but trying to expand that by marketing Christs suffering. <br />WWJD Mel
1558216847|5.0|This is the most amazing story I've ever read. It's an incredible journey that displays the furthest boundaries of the human spirit to achieve freedom. It makes the \\"Great Escape\\" look like a walk in the park.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|this will be short and sweet: <br /> <br />I am no stranger to ages of all kinds of music, and maybe this is a function of my life at the time that this CD was at its peak time in my CD player, but i recently realized that this may very well be my favorite CD of all time.  I don't know what in the world amazon's editor's comment is talking about, but if you don't love this CD after FULLY absorbing it (i.e. listening to it more than just a few times), let me know and this one's on me.

B00028HBKC|5.0|THE 'FEEL GOOD' MOVIE OF THE YEAR....SEE IT WIT YO KEEEEEEYUDS!  Oye, I hate CONTRIVED HYSTERIA!
B0002IU988|5.0|I previewed the video and songs on the offical band website and immediately ran out to Best Buy to pick up the cd.  I am huge rock fan, modern, classic and christian. This cd ranks up there with the best of \\"modern rock/70's style\\" of rock.    The sound is of course very Creedesque and has 3 of the original members playing, but the new lead vocalist Myles Kennedy is excellent and similar in style and tone to Scott Stapp but a little closer to a Sammy Haggar/Chad Kroeger combination.    The cd has something for every rock fan on it, it is part hard core and part emotional, you won't be disappointed.      Could be the CD of the year and definately a grammy nominee if not a winner.     I can't stop listening to this cd. When you hear songs for the first time and you start singing along even when you dont yet know the words it is obvious they are impact songs and are destined to be hits. This cd will be a chart topper and it is quickly climbing the billboard chart.    Yes its not Creed and Scotts not singing, but Myles has great range and depth to his singing. The ballads are very emotional and he does a great job, give him some credit, he is a professional and wouldnt be on this cd with these great musicians if he was'nt an excellent singer. Scott is a legend and was a great singer/Creed frontman and I admire him for comming out and announcing he's a christian and wants to do christian rock projects.     Let's set the record straight Mark and Scott parted on great terms. Scott just wanted to go in a different direction and we have to respect him for that. I got news for you fans, although they may not be a \\"christian band\\" Alter Bridge's members are also very spiritual and christian (listen to the lyrics and themes), just let them do their thing and hopefully we will get more fantastic cd's from Alter Bridge like this one.
B0000524CY|5.0|Not only a classic because it will last forever as being the scariest movie ever.  I finally got to see this masterpiece, you see i first saw Exorcist the beginning which is just as good in my opinion, and i liked it alot so i wanted to see the original.  They are both the best horror films ever, equal in shock and power, they arent just horror films they are dramatic suspenseful very well crafted masterpieces, worthy of many oscars, both of them.  Let first just clarify a few things some people are too stupid to comprehend.  Someone complains that the beginning was incorrect in that it happens in africa, well if you have really seen this one you would know that right before Merrin arrives there are 2 priests talking about who they should get to do the exorcism, one of them says that they should get father Merrin because he has had experience 10 or 12 years before in Africa and that the exorcism almost killed him.  That brings me to the next thing, someone else said the exorcism in the beginning didnt seem that bad and the one in the original took place for months, thats not true at all, if you have seen this film you should know the exorcism happens in one night just like the one in the beginning, although i must admit the actual exorcism process in this one is far more scarier, although the other one was just as scary.  They both have smart stories that are well done, they both are shocking and scary throughout, they both are dramatic, they both have outstanding performances, and they are both true masterpieces.  I give them both a 9 out of a 10, if you have a brain and a good eye for great cinema you can easily see they are both amazing and should not be missed.
B00028HBL6|5.0|I am disappointed in people's reaction to this movie.  I believe that this is the most perfect depiction of the last hours of Christ's life that has ever been made.  As for Mr. Claypool and his remark about the \\"eye of a needle\\"... I don't believe Mel Gibson's purpose in making this movie was to make money.  I have read many interviews (Reader's Digest, Guideposts, etc.) in Christian based magazines and seems to me the most important goal for Mr. Gibson was to get the message of Christianity to the masses, which I believe he did in a very effective way.    I bought the DVD last night (...) and watched it as soon as I woke up this morning.  Yes, I am aware there are no special features.  Yes, I am aware there is no bonus material.  Is it so important?  Is it so significant?  With this movie I believe it is not.  So for those of you who praise the movie your views on this movie are deserved; for those of you who believe otherwise, maybe you should watch it again a few more times... Do you not see what your Lord Jesus Christ went through for you?  Even the actor (Jim Caviezel) endured pain and suffering and bloodshed to bring this depiction and imagery to you (...).  I don't think the actors and director and filmographers... anyone associated with this movie has gotten the just credit for what they have done.  May God bless you all and yours.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This film feels like Tarantino, its not however, its Leone who you can tell inspired Tarantino.  Hell Tarantino even used one of the songs from this movie in Kill Bill Vol 2.  This movie has a little bit of action, a little bit of drama, a little bit of comedy, and a whole lot of style.  The only real flaw is the sound editing when people talk, sometimes it feels like one of those sucky Bruce Lee \\"films\\" where you hear different things then how their mouths are movin, this happens sometimes, not the whole time, but enough to make it kind of irritating, its a small flaw but after 3 hours it gets to ya.  There is one other thing that really isnt a flaw but is somewhat annoying, the pace, sometimes it takes the characters 3 minutes to walk acroos the room, or 5 minutes to start talking, i know its suppose to build tension or suspense, but once you get 2 minutes of a guy standing there not doing anything i think we get the point, another small thing.  Apart from that the movies is brilliant, the music is freakin awesome definetly inspired Tarantino, the characters names ( good, bad, ugly) more style and original, there is some cool western action and a civil war scene where they blow up a bridge (thats very cool), and theres lots of funny things that just supply more entertainment.  I give the movie a 9 out of a 10, those 2 things make the overall feel suffer alittle, but trust me its the best western ever made, one that you can watch without and enjoy not just watch and hope to die.  Its definetly the only western i like, in fact i think its Leones best, i also like the fact that he didnt put tons of smut in this one like he did with Once upon a time in America, a good movie but way too much smut, see this movie its a classic, its like watchin Tarantino do a western a couple of years ago thats all, totally kick ass.
B0000683WG|5.0|Make no mistake about it, Electric Warrior is the best place to start if you're new to T Rex but if you're feeling inspired this isn't a bad place either. When I bought Electric Warrior I was instantly drawn into the heavy rocking sound and the incredible voice of Marc Bolan. He instantly became my favorite glam rocker ever. It really wasn't until I picked up this set that I was blown over entirely. When you hear these two discs you begin to wonder how this guy was so over looked in the US. In my opinion he was the best thing going in the early 70's. Anyway, with this set you get two discs, one the remastered studio album with two very worthwhile outtakes at the end and on the second you get alternate versions and early demos along with a few more outtakes. All of this along with good liner notes which detail the time and era in T Rex history. The second disc may not grab you initially, but it's really worth owning. The outtakes are really good accoustic renditions of the original and they really give the songs a whole new set of characteristics that I find myself turning to as much as the original album. On songs like Ballroom of Mars I actually find myself preferring the acoustic version. Anyway, I highly recommend this set for anyone that is looking for a great rock and roll record.
B000000645|5.0|By some happy coincidence, the music of the Incredible String Band hasn't enjoyed periodic rediscovery, popular acclaim, or critical fashion. In other words, the ISB wanders its own weird, trippy way -- for better or worse -- into being one of the swinging Sixties' most cultish bands. The music's excesses can be either utterly charming or utterly silly, depending on your mood, and the lyrics are full of mystical, mythological wordplay (\\"The Minotaur's Song\\" owes a heavy debt to Gilbert & Sullivan.) Like the rest of Mike Heron and Robin Williamson's work at this late date, \\"The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter\\" is beyond being an acquired taste; most of the reviews here cite what an immediate personal and emotional response this music evokes. Fans of British folk should give it a try, though. It may not ultimately be your cup of tea, but it's genuinely unlike any other accoustic music you've ever heard.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I saw Gangs of New York the other day for the first time ever. I missed it in theater but finally I got the chance to see it the other day. I wasn't disappointed and Martin Scorsese shows us once again why he's arguebly the best director in Hollywood.<br /><br />Gangs of New York takes place in the 1846. We begin with Priest Vallon(Neison) talking to his young son Amsterdam. Priest is the leader of the \\"Dead Rabits\\" Irish gang. He's fighting for his people and thats just whats about to happen. Priest is leading his gang against Bill the Butcher(Day-Lewis) who is the leader of the Natives in the Five Points area of New York.<br /><br />The battle takes place and is very savage. The combats are fighting with knives, swords, cleavers, and anything else that is sharp blunt or can kill someone. Bill and the natives win and Priest is killed right in front of his son. Bill sends young Amsterdam off to reform school and the Irish know now with there loss they are at the mercy of Bill.<br /><br />16 years later Amsterdam is released from the reform school and he comes back to the Five Points. He befriends someone he knew as  child named Johnny(Thomas) who quickly informs him of what has happened in the last 16 years. He shows Amsterdam the ropes and gets him into Bill's circle of friends.<br /><br />Of course Amsterdam wants Bill dead, but he knows he can't get to him yet. He quickly impresses the man and becomes somewhat of an apprentince to him. In the meantime Amsterdam has also found a lover in Jenny(Diaz) a local thief and prostitute. He likes her but doesn't trust her.<br /><br />In the meantime the city isn't getting any better. The draft is taking place and the only reason the Irish aren't getting drafted is because of the threat of violence from the gangs. Amsterdam is getting himself closer and closer to Bill and is looking for the right moment when he can kill him. His intentions are tipped to Bill from Johnny because he likes Jenny but she likes Amsterdam. The stage now is set for war between Bill and Amsterdam. It will involve the Natives against the Irish. It's just not the two gangs though. America was born in the streets and this war tells its tale.<br /><br />This movie is phenomenal. The details that were put into the making. This is a very beautiful ugly movie. The sets aren't pretty and neither are the actors. It takes place in the slums so nothing should be. The authenticity of the sets is amazing. Scorsese pays attention to the details and it's obvious throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />The acting is superb in the movie. Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill is dramatic acting at it's  best. The details he puts into the character are great. He becomes Bill and plays him so well. I love the speech he gives Amsterdam about killing his dad. It's a strong passionate scene. The scene where Bill is being sarcastic over the dead rabbit is great. The range of Lewis is shown in the character and he definetly earned his Oscar nominatin.<br /><br />Leonardo Di Caprio isn't bad as Amserdam Vallon. I think it was kind of a miscast for him, but he doesn't play the part bad. I'm looking forward to seeing him in Scorsese new film this Christmas \\"The Aviator\\" where he will play Howard Hughes. He's more a pretty boy actor and this down to earth dirty role doesn't fit him that well.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is also kind of a miscast. She is such a glamorous woman and watching her in this kind of movie is just wrong. Her acting isn't bad you just have to look past the fact that it's her.<br /><br />Gangs of New York is not for the weak hearted. This is a very violent movie and it's full of bad language and nudity as well. The violence is brutal with knives and clubs being the main weapons. The fights are shot very well and look authentic. Nothing is over the top with them.<br /><br />This movie should have won some Oscars. It was nominated for 10 and received none. Martin Scorsese is cheated out once again by the academy. He is still winless and thats a shame. This is one of the best directors in the world at his best doing a movie only he is capable of because very few other people could do this.<br /><br />The DVD extras are great. The documentaries are good and there are loads of stuff. The music video from U2 isn't all that bad either. If you love your DVD extras you wont' be disappointed.<br /><br />This is a good movie. It's not Scorsese's best but you won't be disappointed. This is drama at it's best. If you want a nice three hour escape than this is it.vie only he is capable of because very few other people could do this.    The DVD extras are great.

B00028HBKM|4.0|Growing up Roman Catholic(half italian) and being force-fed the story of Christ on the Cross, it was easy to discount the suffering done in our name.  I remember thinking, \\"I can't wait til this is over, I've got a softball game today\\". <br /> <br />This film, for me, has brought new meaning to the 2000 year old story, which for myself and my friends, was a chore to endure rather than a gift to be celebrated. <br /> <br />In my 39 years on this planet I never even once, to my shame, really gave a thought to what this lowly Jewish carpenter endured for our benefit. <br /> <br />To all the antisemitic complaints and antisemitic people who misunderstand and/or misuse this Holy story to further their own hatred, I say, \\"Shame on you!\\". <br /> <br />(stands on soapbox) <br />Yes, the Romans crucified Christ.  Yes, if my ancestors had anything to do with the crucifixion, I bear some responsibility.  Yes this was all done with the Jewish clergy's(READ AS: \\"A very select few Jewish people's\\") consent, wishes, and blessing for no other reason than to maintain their power and control over their Jewish brothers and sisters. <br /> <br />It is important to remember that Christ was a Jew. And not just a 'goes to temple on holidays' type of Jew, He was an extremely devout Jew. Most of His disciples and followers were also Jewish.  Paul, the founder of the Catholic Church, was a Jew.  Anyone with a functioning brain who is a true believer in Christ's teachings would: <br />   1. not blame an entire people for the misdeeds of the few in power.  To do so would make them just as guilty as Osama blaming all of the people in the U.S. for the perceived crimes of the government <br />   2. at the forefront of Christ's teachings was forgiveness.  So many hypocrites claim to follow Christ, however fall short when it comes to forgiveness.  Bear in mind as you watch this film and are completely disgusted at the torture this Son of God is enduring, that when all was said and done, He forgave,as He hanged in agony awaiting death, He forgave ALL involved.  For myself and anyone else who calls themselves Christian, to not forgive would be to completely disregard all in which we claim to believe. <br />(steps down from soapbox) <br /> <br />In closing, I'd like to say that I found this film to be a true work of art as it provoked thought and debate on a subject that has divided people on this planet for over 2000 years.  As a Catholic, this film has both renewed and strengthened my faith in ways that 39 years of going to Mass failed to do.  I would have given the movie 5 stars, but I feel that their should have been a at least as much emphasis on Christ's forgiveness as on the torture endured. <br /> <br />You probably won't enjoy this film, it's powerful imagery and blatant violence will probably disturb you.  But everyone, both Christian and non-Christians alike, should see this film. <br /> <br />C. Fletcher
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This is the worst movie i have ever seen to much CGI witch recks the whole film and then creator screws around with all the classic monsters. The acting and fight scenes are awful. From the beginning of the film the use material fom other movies. <br />Like Batman Disneys Version of The Three Muskateers Blade and about ten more movies. stupid rip off
B0000CFW87|4.0|Josh Groban has been ofter compared to Clay Aiken. But the only similarity between the two singers is the fact that both sing ballads. Josh Groban's voice is rich in barritone. On the CD Closer Groban sings in Italian, Spanish, French, and English. He does an excelent job in singing in four diffrent languages. His voice is very strong and moving. The songs are very smooth and relazing. He is most definetly not an opera singer. Groban made and okay transition to pop.
B0002S94OS|4.0|for starters,(4.5 Stars on it ifpossible) i want to say i really love this album due to the large variety of riffs. many bands today have this mindset that in order to get a new array of songs or new material they have to change their style of music all together. As in Korn and better yet, Slipknot(Boy was that not the biggest dissapointment in album hype history EVER) anywho. Yeah, for guitar players, bass players alike. this album is definatly inspirational, a complete new array of songs that don't sound like a repeat of NAG or ATPB but still keep the raw Lamb of god style. TOTALLY balls to the wall(thats the dumbest term ever.....) anywho, i love this shiz. So here we go, album breakdown (from a 17 year old metal head) <br /> <br />Laid to Rest - 5 stars - The thing with this album that really stands out that the drum's bass drum are SUPER meaty, no little door knocking sounds here. sounds like your really in the studyio ha. the song as a whole is a kick a$$ listen, i love it. <br /> <br />Hourglass - 4 - Starts off with a constant slap on the snare(drives me nuts, hate when any metal act does that) the song seems kinda average at first but the chorus riffing and vocals are really fun to sing (or scream in this case to). At the end draws out with a climactic scream and increased sound in some riffing though it's not the catchiest song on the album, it sure has some kick arse riffing and awesome drumming. <br /> <br />Now You've Got Something to Die For - 3.5 - I like the chorus a good deal, and in the middle of the song there is some really memorable high end riffing.(oh yeah the outro is real cool) Good song. <br /> <br />The Faded Line - 4.5 - wtf dude.... this should be illegal from 1:07 to like 1:30 something, they throw in this quick riffing that just kicks ass. and at 1:50 what do you know, the beloved intro to their website. 2:58 some really kick ass enhanced yelling i like a great deal. then industrial sounds at the end? oh well, it's lamb of god. they can do whatever they want haha. <br /> <br />Omerta - 3.5 - I like the two cents in the beginning of the song, pretty shnoogans i'd say. I personally don't think the song get's good till like 2:47, cause it's saved by the drumming (kick arse usage of the bell on the cymbals) then cool riffing till the end. <br /> <br />Blood on Scribe - 5 - Okay what did i say about hourglass? freakin slapping on the snare. oh well this song quickly turns to one of the best songs on the album. I'm geiving it 5 stars due to the awesome versatility of the guitars. Lots of bands fail hardcore in this area. they either have like 3 riffs in the whole song or just constantly tremolo pick which can get annoying as all Hel1. But okay this track has the ULTIMATE CAR THUMPING RIFF from 3:33 to 4:10 You'll understand when you hear it. <br /> <br />One Gun - 3 - Eh, sad to say. that this is the first song on the album that's kinda bland. It has one the guest soloist on it, but im not big on soloing at all. so maybe this rating will shoot up for most people if you like soloing. <br /> <br />Break You - 5 - One of the coolest riffs ever? Quite possible. I only wish i could come up with riffs this cool, or well even just play this fast in the first place. 2:39 starts a riff that will probably make your mouth drop and piss on yourself, just rediculously cool. And then the song just ends up on just an awesome note. it's great. <br /> <br />What I've Become - 4 - for some reason i like the rhythm he uses while sasying \\"It's all a lied, it died 100,000 miles ago.\\" (yes, 100,00 miles AGO). But yea this song i don't think has any real trip balls riffs like Break You or Blood on Scribe. But it has an awesome \\"singalong\\" factor haha. <br /> <br /> <br />Ashes of the Wake - 5! - Okay this is more of an instrumental track i would say. It's like a 5 minute song i believe, but i only really listen to the 3 minute mark, cause that's all i really need out of it. The the Rhythm track they play under the solo(....sigh....) is TripBalls. Another car thumper i would say if the solo wasn't there to screech your ears out. Oh well is suppose i could always turn the treble down and crank the bass.... but my bad(im listening to the album as i write this review) around 3:15 there is a cool slower rhythm goin that goes with the solo that's kinda cool to just vibe to. Muy gustar. But yeah not really digging the constant soloing. <br /> <br />Remporse for the Dead - ummmm - well this track is errr long as F*CK(Tool? Opeth anyone?) A real light vibe till like 1:20, but the riffs are good (AS usual, i've been sayin that like through the whole friggin review)2:25 on is pretty good.Oh screw there is like a hundred different riffs in this song... FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD THE SONG IS GOOD, AND SO IS THE ALBUM GO BUY IT ALREADY!!! <br /> <br /> <br />Fine Print: When reviewing i havent looked at the lyrics hardly at all, and when i fine good lyrics in the midst of a kickarse or (trip balls riff :) ,  the coolness of the song skyrockets for me) so yea the songs are probably better than i metioned. <br />
B0000TB01Y|3.0|When I first got this I thought it was the best musical ever. After a while I found out it wasnt the musical I liked, it was Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth that made it great. Take both of them away and the show is nothing. Idina truly deserved her tony. Even though it is overrated, it def. deserved to win over Avenue Q. The best musical of the year was Caroline, Or Change. If you want a good musical with great talent (except for the little white boy) then buy that instead.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Brother Ray, this fine CD and upcoming companion movie will stand as a final testament of your scope of work, wide range of friends, and cross-cultural reach of the songs. <br /> <br />The dozen gems included on this CD illustrate the deep and genuine respect Brother Ray commanded from his contemporaries.  I can't think of many folks capable of getting such a diverse group of sidemen: JT, Norah, Willie, Elton, B.B.,Bonnie, Diane Krall Costello, and Johnny Mathis (!) are standouts.  But there're no lean efforts whatsoever. <br /> <br />Of the bunch, Van Morrison's set-closing \\"Crazy Love\\" is tops.  Recorded at the Songwriters Hall of Fame ceremony where Brother Ray inducted Mr. Morrison, it's everything that makes you love music.  The sound is performed on an artistic tightrope wihout a net. It's edgy, spontaneous, compulsive, and filled with a heart-full-of-soul (oh yeah, mama!). <br /> <br />It will be very vogue to worship at the alter of Brother Ray during this post-mortem period.  But good as this CD is, it's far from Brother Ray's finest effort.  The true importance of this should be as an honest introduction to his expansive catalogue. <br /> <br />I'm tempted to say \\"Rest In Peace, Brother Ray.\\"  But way up there amongst the heavenly choir, I just know he's got the joint moving to the sounds that fill eternity.  <br /> <br />      <br /> <br />
B000001FS3|5.0|I mean, great album, but it sounds truly muddy and awful in this 1990 disc. \\"One Tree Hill\\": one of the most underrated songs in the catalogue. Amazing tune.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|OH Mah god!! Like have you listened to like Avrils new CD!!! Like is this like music!?!

B00028HBKM|5.0|While the DVD lacks special features, it is a true milestone in film.  So well done, every scene meticulously authentic---you can almost touch the stones in Jerusalem.  If you have any Christian faith at all, this movie will almost make you want to explode with emotion---sorrow at the pain of Christ, who suffered for all; the loving relationship with his mother; the helplessness of his disciples; and thankfulness for His sacrifice.  Ignore the critics who only see the blood and ignore the Lamb.  Thank you, Mr. Gibons.  You have done a great service.
B00003CWL5|1.0|Technically, this is a very well-crafted film, and the script does have a certain amount of black humor which is funny, but by and large I found the film nihilistic and demeaning to women, treating them solely as sex objects.  Moreover, the one \\"hero\\" in the film is a drug dealer whose \\"occupation\\" detracted from his message of art and love. <br /> <br />I did watch the film through to the end simply because I could not believe it could get any worse, but worse it got.  Nowadays this is considered a classic film that is studied in film courses, but in my own personal view only the technical aspects of the film are worth raving about.  As a woman and a feminist, I find the movie greatly insulting.  Sorry if anyone out there thinks me mean-spirited for this, but, that's the way I feel.
006092988X|5.0|Betty Smith's classic is probably my all-time favorite book. After falling in love with it at age 13, I've read it at least 100 times as I approach age 40. And each time, I find something new -- a new character insight, a bit of description that I hadn't noticed before. Each character is memorably drawn, leaping off the page and coming to vivid life in my mind's eye as I read. I recommend it for all ages, but it's especially good for young girls and women who are, like Francie, smart and bookish and a bit of a square peg.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|Glad to see the whimsical brain eating zombies at it again in PT II now on DVD for the first time. I have been hesitant to play my VHS version in fear to wearing it out to much. <br /> <br />Hopefully they will re-release the soundtrack. Which contained some good 80s garage band music: <br /> <br />\\"Space Hopper\\" (Opening Credits) <br />\\"Big Band B Boy\\" (Background music used when the boy runs in his house after dealing with the zombie) <br />\\"Walking Dead\\" (Zombies crawling out and walking used in Pt1 too) <br />\\"Bad Case of Loving You\\" (Race from the Docs house to the Hospital) (was not featured on the orginal soundtrack) <br />\\"Monster Mash\\" (End Credits) <br /> <br />If you are a Z()/\/\BIE fan like myself, you will want to add this to your collection. <br /> <br />As in the first one, Some \\"Easter Eggs\\" have been lost yet again by the Army. And a yong boy discovers them while running away from some bullies. <br /> <br />But the bullies find the boy along with the Easter Eggs, and decide to open it. Well you guess it the Trioxin leaks out over the bullies, and then a nice rainstorm washes into the local cemetary of the new housing development being built. <br /> <br />Eventually the town is overrun with zombies on their quest for brains, and the only thing that can stop them is... <br /> <br />Well you need to watch it to find out. <br /> <br />Frank and Burt return, this time around they are two bumbling grave robbers who get caught up in the zombie mayhem and of course the Trioxin. <br /> <br />\\"Get that screwdriver out of my HEAD!!!!\\" <br />-Zombie Head (Return of the Living Dead 2)
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I love the duet with Norah Jones, her smooth - soft voice compared with his aging rasp.  I have to say that's my favorite track.  This cd is bittersweet but lovely.  \\"Genius Loves Company\\" is like a last will and testament.  Ray Charles wore his joyous heart on his sleeve through his music and his smile and left that for our memory.<br /><br />He could be completely comfortable and loose in the presence of pop, country or R&B and he shows it off in this cd.  I love his rhythum of \\"Hey Girl\\" with Michael McDonald and his masterful \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" with Gladys Knight.  From an inspiring musician's lifetime of art, this cd is a fine thought to leave with us.
B00005MEPV|4.0|OK: Stars wars Episode I is an overall great movie. HOWEVER, I would say it's *not* worth waiting... 16 years for. on to Jar jar 1st of all: he's annoying, but he's meant to be. This film has a good story and the action is good. The acting is a little kid-ish: farting Eopies, Jar Jar stepping in 'poodoo' Anakin yelling 'yippee', etc. However, Darth Maul (and his lightsaber) made the movie, as did Liam Nesson's acting. The best special feature that I liked was the Beginning: Making of Epsiode I. All &amp; all, a great film. I can see why hard-core star wars fans wouldn't like it as much (or at all) compared to the others, but it's neat to see Obi-Wan as a Jedi learner; the Republic and the Jedi Order still alive. Because come Episode III (cue Imperial March and breathing)....
B0002IQHY8|5.0|I have to update my original review (last paragraph) as I have listened to this CD solidly for 2 weeks now, and still attest to it's quality EXCEPT that it is TOO SHORT. It needs another 15 minutes.    Those who hate this album, would also hate \\"Tales of Mystery...\\" and \\"I, Robot\\" as the style and musical content is very similar. I can't see how this could be considered a 'young person's music' or 'pop'. \\"Repetitive and electronic\\", I remember many people's parents making those claims against APP in the 1970s. To think this way is to run the risk of becoming \\"OTHER PEOPLE'S PARENTS\\" in which case, the best course of action should be to make a cup of tea, sit in a comfy chair, pull the rug over your knees and be at one with Johnny Mathis.    Any professors of music that would label this CD 'unmusical' must either be listening to a different CD, or have smeared a big snot covered thumb print on the CD before playing it. There is more music on this CD than some are able to handle (I qualify that I am a classical and jazz musician and afficianado). Those who complain about 'dogs' and 'babies' should consider the possibility of the onset of 'selective memory'!! AP wouldn't be AP if he removed the sounds of rain/thunder/rooms full of people/clinking bottles/screaming (Tales), radio DJs (Vulture Culture), cars (Stereotomy) planes/wind/children chattering/cracks/bangs (On Air). \\"Aaaargh, music ain't what it was in my day....\\"    Original review on first listening:  Well I'm 39 years old, and think this album is just great. I am a Parsons fan, and while not fussed with 'Time Machine', I think this is classic Parsons, mature and adapting. Like great composers that reused and adapted old works he has taken Raven and Mammagamma, and done some awesome rework. Okay, so I miss the orchestral sounds, but the richness of sounds and tones is just as spine tingling. If you're reading, Alan - THANKS, and look forward to your next album - keep experimenting!
B0001EBXBK|5.0|This is the first Tarrantino film I've seen. I like the... unique film style he uses. Sometimes he goes black &amp; white. It is unique, bizzare but overall enjoyable. I don't wanna say the synopsis, other tham watch the trailers. Origianlly, Vol. 1 &amp; 2 was siupposed to be one long movie ( a friend of mine spliced them on his computer so Vol. 1 has no closing credits and Vol. 2 has no opening credits). This is fast paced and action packed, and right after watching this half of the story you want to see how it ends. I can't wait to see Pulp Fiction!
0316548189|4.0|Here is a man who fought his entire life for the freedom of his people, including 27 years in prison.  An inspiring story that I didn't know much about until I read this book.  A little long and detailed, but I definitely have a greater appreciation for this man and his struggle.  If you don't know the story of Nelson Mandela, you should read this book!
B00005JMUA|4.0|OK: the second half of the story. it's more traditional Tarrntino. But as such *I* like Vol. 1 better. Ther'es FAR less violence and killing in this (don't wanna ruin it, you'll see...). I was surprised in the way that they revealed Bill: I liked his appearance being a mystery more. This movie is more drama based, but still extremely well done. Fans of Special Edition DVDs take note: there will be a deluxe box set which'll have the uncut (as if!) versions of both films that aired overseas. Tarrantino says that he'll do 6 DVDs: Vol. 1 'weak eidtion' , Vol. 2 'weak edition', a box set of the two, Vol. 1 Special Edition, Vol.2 Special Edition and Special Edition box set (what I'm holding out for)
B0000666DW|5.0|In contrast to a recent review of mine in which I labeled Linkin Park as textbook \\"pop\\" music, this is textbook metal.  This is really a landmark metal album; in my opinion, one of the best of the new millenium.  What I love about this album is that it is not typical metal fare.  These guys aren't just satisfied with tuning their guitars down low and slamming out metal chords.  This album has some great lead guitar work, as well as a few prolonged instrumentals.   <br /> <br />\\"Crusher Destroyer\\" and \\"March of the Fire Ants\\" are the songs that get the most attention, but there is so much more to this release.  Try \\"Ol'e Nessie\\" and the other two previously mentioned songs, and you've got a pretty good idea of what to expect from this album.  If you like those songs, you'll love this album.  If you don't, you're probably a Linkin Park fan, in which case, what are you doing here anyway?
B0002I831S|5.0|\\"Rating this set less than 5 stars because you think Paramount is ripping you off is silly. Who didn't know that they would release the season sets?\\"<br /><br />Back in 1999 the norm was to release shows in individual volumes. It was Fox and the X-Files which changed the way we think. But when Trek started on DVD, this was the only way (Twilight Zone and I Spy also came out individually at this time). Anyone who bought the DVDs as they initially came out thought this was normal. Anyone who says different is lying to sound smart.<br /><br />Trust me, if I knew box sets were coming, I never would have bought the 40 volumes. But, I did, I loved them and they did tide me over until today. I am buying the box sets and either selling my old or donating them.<br /><br />Great show, baby. 1966 is back!
B00008H2LB|1.0|The editorial review for this album says that Linkin Park is what Trent Reznor has always been afraid of becoming.  There is a reason for that, you know.  An innovative and talented artist like him should be afraid to become a talentless, unimaginative, and corny musical act like Linkin Park.  Seriously, all of you LP fanatics have to hear how comically monotonous the lyrics are on this album.  They sound like 3rd graders wrote them, maybe they did.  Some people have said that Linkin Park has saved metal.  Actually, in a roundabout way, they might be right.  Hopefully, people will listen to this garbage and swear off pop rock like this forever and go buy more acutal metal CD's.  Yeah, go Linkin Park!
B00003CXD5|5.0|A western that will leave you fully awake!  Great character study.  Even for people like me who don't like most of bogart's material, this movie rocks.
B0002IU988|5.0|If you only buy one cd this year (unlikely), Make it this one!  This is the best rock cd ever! This is not just Creed with a different singer. (I am a big Creed fan.) Alter Bridge has a unique sound all thier own. Call it modern 70's.  The music has melody, something we haven't heard for a while.  The lyrics are not violent, vile or degrading to women.  And it just flat out ROCKS!
0671027344|4.0|I found this book to be both humorous and creatively written. The author manages to right from a youthful perspective which brings a sense of innocence to the character, Charlie. \\"The Perks of being a Wallflower\\" modernly summarizes the trials and tribulations of being a teenager through the character of Charlie and his experiences with love,homosexuality,sex, school, family, and drugs. I feel books like these,that actually touch base with realstic and personal events that happens to everyone sooner or later, are meaningful and interesting. This book certainly attracted my attention, as i found it harder and harder to put down. The story focuses of a fifteen year old high-school boy named Charlie, who is unique in personality and thought, which differenciates him from the other teenagers in the story. His emotional rollercoasters and natural thoughts can make the reader both laugh and sympathize with his issues. He deals with unknown and buried issues, which is revealed suprisingly at the end, that hold him back somewhat for the \\"normal crowd\\" of high school, and associates him with a more influencial and confused group of kids going through their own personal problems. The most fascinating element of the book was the way it was written,letter form. You never know who Charlie is really writing to which brings mystery to the story.Overall i give the book four stars for its originalty and pleasant humor. I found Stephen chbosky to be a creative and excellent author, who created an enjoyable and addictive novel with amusement,surprises, and unexpected twists that involves the reader with the character's lives.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I had high expectations for this album, and boy oh boy did LOG meet them. There is no down time on this CD. Most bands who've been around for 4 albums don't have their initial quality, but LOG have definitely improved their overall sound. This CD is for anyone who loves metal or Lamb of God... not only that but for anybody who is ANTI-BUSH!!!! ANTI-WAR!!!! OR ANTI-REPUBLICAN!!!! LOG couldn't have put out a better album and I couldn't be any more satisfied than I am now. And by the way, this is the first CD that has given me goosebumps for a hella long time!!! YES, it's that good!
B00005JL9B|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing and one that has impressed me none like any other movie in the last few months months. <br /> <br />A schoolclass has been taken hostage and brought to a deserted island where, because they have to pay for the sins of being young, they have to enter a game in which the objective is to kill each other. The one that survives wins and is let off the island.  <br /> <br />The tyrant is their old teacher who is just walking around in a training suit not doing a lot but eating cookies. Some of the children start killing immediately, other try to work together. It is very similar to a real computergame. You actually feel the tension of not wanting to die, the fear of death is very well brought onto the screen by the young actors. We are really watching everyone get killed and the score is even being kept on-screen. Girl #3 killed, 30 more to go. <br /> <br />Is it a metaphore of life? just as Lord of the Flies? You sometimes get the feeling it is. Friendships are broken, people start backstabbing etc, even though they are young.  <br /> <br />Other similar movies are Series 7 (but not funny at all and not such a spectacle), The Cube was also a movie that came to mind.  <br /> <br />The movie is shot shakingly, making it very real. The classical music that is played throughout the movie makes it very eerie. There is a scene with Beethoven for example which is excellent. <br /> <br />I never expected this movie to be this graphic, bloody and very very good. It is definitely one of the best Japanese movies I have ever seen and I will remember it for years to come.
B0002IU988|5.0|Creed was a good band, but Alter Bridge just totally blows them away. Their vocals are more powerful and music more meaningful. Their concert is going to be great this fall, and their CD should be doing alot better than it is. Buy this one if it is the only one you will buy this year.
6304884419|3.0|I do not agree that this is deNiro's best performance. Raging Bull, The Godfather and Goodfellas were all beter parts and also better movies. The story is not bad, though the maffia characters are a little over the top. The man who always loses bets is funny, but out of place as well. <br /> <br />The story is both about the maffia in the Bronx but also about race relations in 1968 and therefore also worth watching.  <br /> <br />See this if you have already seen Goodfellas, The Godfather and all the other maffia movies, if not: them first and then think again.
B000067J1H|4.0|About half way through David Fincher's \\"Fight Club,\\" I found myself remembering one of Barney Fife's lines from \\"The Andy Griffith Show.\\" 'Here at The Rock we have two rules. Rule Number One: Obey all the rules.' It is highly unlikely that the director had any desire to remind viewers of this ancient comedic moment, but there's no denying that odd flashes of humor crop up here and there throughout the film. \\"Fight Club\\" has been described by detractors as overly slick and heavily macho, but its fans find it clever and visually stunning, with moments of real brilliance. I think the fans have got it right: there are some moments of brilliance, and if you can deal with the explicit violence the movie is beautiful to watch.  <br />     The unnamed protagonist (excellent work by Edward Norton) is a sad sack white collar worker suffering from insomnia and drifting aimlessly through the more or less soulless environment of contemporary urban America. In an effort to feel connected to something--anything--he becomes a support-group addict, religiously attending self-help meetings for alcoholics, cancer patients, etc., etc. When his apartment, with all of his carefully collected worldly goods, literally explodes, he finds refuge with a chance acquaintance, the mysterious Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt in a rivetting performance). It is with Tyler that Norton's character finds a new, seemingly meaningful way to feel \\"connected\\": the two men fight. And fight and fight. It makes them feel \\"up,\\" it makes them feel real. Other men, most of them oddball or dysfunctional individuals alienated from society, join their fight club. The narrator is torn between his better instincts and the attraction of Tyler's way of life and nihilistic philosophy. As Tyler's persona becomes more and more disturbing--he has also seduced the only woman for whom the protagonist has any real feeling (well played by Helena Bonham Carter)--it becomes apparent that he, and the greatly expanded, nation-wide Fight Club, must be stopped. But how? And who, exactly, IS Tyler Durden? <br />     The decaying interiors and dark exterior shots that abound in \\"Fight Club\\" are wonderfully filmed in a manner slightly reminiscent of \\"Blade Runner,\\" and the truly fine acting by Norton and Pitt sends out sparks. Even during scenes that are in no way believable (I can't explain or I'll give away the ending), Norton effectively conveys the impression of a confused and frustrated Everyman. Pitt is dark and charismatic, and yes, he looks great, even in Tyler's hideous bathrobe and other unappealing garments. <br />     This film is not for the weak of stomach, and the conclusion may be disturbing for those who were in New York for 9/11, but it's a genuinely interesting creation. It may not be as deep and thought provoking as its most avid fans proclaim, but it is a fine piece of work, definitely worth at least one viewing.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is the lastest in a long line of \\"Passion Plays\\" and Films created about the final hours of the life of the man known as Jesus.  It comes at a time in history when the Western world is becoming more secular and religion is becoming more and more of a taboo.  Because of these reasons, this movie has been portrayed in a most unfortunate light.<br /><br />Even if you are not religious, this is one of the most important stories ever told, and one of the most incredible uses of film.  It draws on historical first hand accounts and tells the story of the murder of a man who went against those in power and tried to spread the message of love.  Modern film has advanced to a point where the torture he endured can be accurately portrayed on film.  Don't let the violence blind you to the point of this film, that this man had a vision and was willing to withstand any pain in order to share it with the world.<br /><br />Mel Gibson has said that he drew from the eyewitness accounts collected in the Bible's New Testament, as well as the diaries of the Catholic mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich as collected in her book, 'The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ'.  Even if you are not a Catholic or a Cristian, everything in this movie has been supported as historically accurate by many secular academics.  It also draws from films such as \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" and others.<br /><br />The film was made with an eye towards accuracy and its realism is often difficult to watch because of the tortures Jesus endures.  All of the visual imagery serves a purpose, and shows us realistically just how much pain Jesus was willing to go through to fulfil what he saw as his destiny.<br /><br />The dialogue is in Latin, Aramaic and Hebrew with english subtitles.  Contrary to what other reviewers have suggested, these are not \\"dead\\" languages just yet, though aramaic and latin are only spoken in small enclaves of the world.  There are still populations that grow up speaking off-shoots of these languages.  I applaud the film-maker for boldly attempting to film this in the original languages of the time period portrayed.  The actors do wonderful jobs in these languages, a difficult task indeed.<br /><br />The film is also a masterpiece of cinematography. This wide screen edition of the DVD finally allows the home viewer to see the film done justice.  I've seen the movie several times and the wide screen DVD better captures the power of watching the film in a theatre than the VHS or regular format DVD.<br /><br />The scenery and sets are also impressive. No expense was spared in bringing the film-makers vision to life.<br /><br />Yet all of these incredible elements are trumped by superb directing and acting.  Caveziel gives us what is in my humble opinion the best portrayal of Jesus to date.  I am not a Jesus scholar, but I have seen a lot of movies like this.  These performances are impressive.<br /><br />This film will not be appropriate for small children or those with thin skin.  Whatever your personal feelings or beliefs are, this movie is a landmark of history being told through film.  Watch it and let us all learn from it so that this history will never be repeated!-shoots of these languages.

038572179X|5.0|As with all of Mr. McEwan's books this one delivered far more than could be asked of it.  The complexity of the books theme of differing perspectives on shared experiences was developed into an easy and delightful read by Mr. McEwan's ability to convey deep meaning with a few well tailored sentences.  The best thing that can be said about this book and all of his others is that he accomplishes in one paragraph what a lesser writer would almost accomplish in a whole chapter.
B00006JIA4|5.0|\\"Greatest Hits\\", \\"Greatest Hits II\\" and \\"Greatest Hits III\\". How many bands can truly claim three Greatest Hits albums that are all actually made up of hits? Every song in this anthology (with one exception, the Elton John version of \\"The Show Must Go On\\") has been a single, and most of them have been hits. <br /> <br />\\"Greatest Hits\\" (the proper UK version, not the undercooked US compilation) is one of those \\"classics\\" that nearly everyone has a copy of tucked away somewhere. And there's a good reason for it - because it's good. 17 tracks, and all of them are top class. The standouts are \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Somebody To Love\\", but \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" and \\"Now I'm Here\\" are hardly anything to sneeze at, and in fact, there isn't really a bad song on the entire album, which puts together the 17 biggest hits Queen had from their conception to 1981. <br /> <br />\\"Greatest Hits II\\" is still, to this day, my favourite CD of all time, and by far the best and most-played Queen CD in my collection. Spanning from November 1981 to October 1991, a ten year retrospective of the second era of Queen provides a brilliant contrast with \\"Greatest Hits I\\" - the music really does sound amazingly different. But by far not WORSE. \\"Innuendo\\" is the pick of the lot, with it's stunning drums and ranging musical styles. \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\" and \\"A Kind Of Magic\\" are also stunning, and again it's really a case of the entire album being well and truly worthy of the prefix \\"Greatest\\". There isn't a bad song on it, and though the music seems to drag a little in the late-middle section, it picks right back up with \\"Hammer To Fall\\" and stays in the rafters to the end. <br /> <br />\\"Greatest Hits III\\" contains some real eye-opening tracks and shouldn't be overlooked as the \\"lesser\\" part of the collection. Nearly all the tracks were singles (even the remix of \\"Under Pressure\\"), and they're all worth the listen (except, maybe, Wyclef Jean's reworking of \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\"). \\"No-One But You\\", Brian's emotional tribute to Freddie, is stunning and brought tears to my eyes, and as one song is worth the price of the anthology alone. The tracks from \\"Made In Heaven\\" and \\"These Are The Days of Our Lives\\" (from Innuendo) are brilliant and George Michael's version of \\"Somebody To Love\\" (which went ukno.1) is an interesting comparison to Freddie's on the first disc. <br /> <br />Sure, it's easy to moan that certain songs didn't make the cut (Spread Your Wings and Tie Your Mother Down in particular) but on a \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation, it wouldn't have made sense - they weren't great hits. And no matter what's missing, what you have here is a three CD, 51 song set that is compulsive listening from start to finish. <br />And I don't think it gets any simpler than that. <br /> <br />SONGS OF NOTE - <br />Disc 1 - Save Me, Somebody To Love, Bohemian Rhapsody <br />Disc 2 - Innuendo, A Kind Of Magic, Who Wants To Live Forever, The Show Must Go On <br />Disc 3 - No-One But You, Heaven For Everyone, Las Parablas Des Amor
B00005JKJA|2.0|I loved the actors in this film-I thought they were awesome. Does anything tie together? Hell no. None of the sequences blend together-and I don't want to have to spend time trying to figure it out. You don't have to have some psychic powers to understand the film. The fact is-it is just thrown together all weird and confusing. I thought there would be some amazing ending. I actually enjoyed sitting and watching it-up until the last quarter of the film when my mind was unable to decipher who was what or who. <br />I don't know-rent it if you like David Lynch I guess-just be prepared for a big question mark.
6303477259|5.0|Gee, I had the chance to see these guys back during this tour in Philadelphia, but did I like them then, nooo, of course not- (kicks own ass). Sure, during this tour I think I was in 2nd or 3rd grade and during that time, my parents would only play Floyd CDs all the time, so it got a little tiring and of course, god forbid I gave in to their Adult music instead of the current Aerosmith fling I was on at that time...grr. But watching this concert always gives me the chills...especially the end of Comfortably Numb...Well, just watch what happens at the guitar solo at the end of the song and watch the crowds' reaction. Its an amazing scene. Anyone who has anything bad to say about this video except that its too short...needs to be dragged into the street to be beaten by a piece of heavy mining equipment and left bleeding in the moonlight. Almost sounds kinda romantic, lol. Overall, definately the BEST live video I've ever seen. Scared the crap out of some of my friends though, but for different reasons. One was totally at awe over the video and actually seemed to be in a trance because he was drooling, lol. The others' reaction was mainly, \\"hey who are these guys; I know this is a Pink Floyd song...But who are these old guys?\\"
B0000640VO|4.0|I loved this film-it was very cute. It's lighthearted, and I highly recommend it.
B0000630YA|5.0|Has it really been 30 years since this album came out?! Because listening to it again today, the music still sounds fresh and original. And unless you have been living under a rock you have already heard several classic tunes off this disk; the title track should be on everyones Halloween mix cd, \\"Only Women Bleed\\" stands the test of time and is one of Alice's most powerful ballads and \\"Cold Ethyl\\" will still produce a chuckle while you tap your foot. My favorite parts of \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\" are the songs that tell a story over a couple tracks, like \\"Devil's Food\\" & \\"Black Widow\\", adding Vincent Price as the narrator was pure genius that Michael Jackson would borrow for his \\"Thriller\\" album a few years later. The real highlight of \\"Nightmare\\" has to be the trilogy of songs based around Cooper's character of Steven. \\"Years Ago\\", \\"Steven\\" and \\"The Awakening\\" are chilling, clever and worth the price of the cd alone. The piano line that links the songs together, mixed with the haunting lyrics and deep echoing drum track really do sound like the soundtrack to a nightmare. You won't take this one out of the stereo for quite awhile guaranteed.
1400031362|4.0|MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is the third installment in the First Ladies Detective Agency Series starring the estimable Mma Ramotswe, a modern woman of Botswana who has not forgotten the beauty of the vanishing older culture.  The first book in the series, THE NO.1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY, was an unexpected Christmas gift of fine writing, a whole new style, a new rhythm to spinning mysteries, infinitely resonate of Africa and humanity. The second book, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE did the first justice, though it was more conventionally linear in its deportment.  This third book is in part episodic like the first and partly straightforward like the second, a wiggly balance that is difficult to reconcile. <br /> <br />MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS essentially rolls a lot of logs at the feet of our heroine.  Her detective agency is leaking rather than garnering profits, despite a busy agenda.  Her fianc, the dependable Mr. JBL Matekoni, is suddenly not himself and his business is in disarray.  A government dignitary wants her to go undercover and prove his sister-in-law is poisoning his brother.  An orphanage wants her to look into the mystery of a foundling.  Meanwhile, a star rises in Mma Ramotswe's secretary, Mma Makutsi, who rushes in where her boss is not and takes on the titular strand of the story, a job involving a beauty contest.  It gives the author an opportunity to tie together the themes inherent in the other story lines. <br /> <br />It's the plotting that's off, feels contrived, and there is less of the whole of Botswana and Africa in this volume.  But it is a chance to spend more time with charming, original characters in an extraordinary place, so do not pass it over.   <br />
0192833383|5.0|My all time favorite book. Read it for the first time when i was nine and  enjoy it still. For mystery fan, this is a must! Don't miss it!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'll not repeat what everyone else has said. In a nutshell, this is a must see movie. NOT for the faint of heart, or for children, but anyone over the age of 15 would benefit from a viewing. There is no anti semitism, and from what I could tell, was true to the Biblical Gospel interpretation. Any variations were miniscule and were of the type that, \\"could have happened\\" (ie, Mary remembering her son falling and her picking him up as a child...in scripture, no, does it matter? NO!)and were tastefully done.  <br /> <br />Anyhow, the movie is great! Five stars, no problem. I do wish that the DVD had some special features though. That is disappointing, but not so disappointing that I didn't buy it. Buy it, add it to your collection of great films. This one had better get an Oscar!!!
B0002IU988|5.0|I was never really much of a fan of Creed, although i did like some of their music. After seeing a commercial for this album i decided to give it a try. I was totally blown away by what i heard. New singer Myles Kennedy puts so much conviction and passion into his singing. His vocal range is unbelievable. And the remaining Creed members sound really tight playing their respective parts. Mark Tremonti really shines on this album, both by his playing and writing. If you're a fan of rock, buy this album. You won't be disappointed.
B0002I831S|5.0|Reviews of each previously release DVD episode are plentiful and need not be repeated ad nauseum.  Just how (including this one) can any reviewer give 5 or less stars to something unknown?  Just what is on the \\"extra\\" DVD material?  Only when we know that will any review be justified.  Sure, save shelf space and some money over the original outrageous two episode per DVD release.  But why buy again unless the additional material is worth picking up?  The 5 stars are for anyone who doesn't already have the DVDs of the original series. The longevity of the series and it's conceptual outgrowth speak for themselves.
B00002SSKI|5.0|This is a great character film expanding the lives of four young girls from the good old 70's decade and stirring up a lot of old memories. <br /> <br />The film starts with the adult versions of the four girls played by Rosie O'Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore and Rita Wilson as they come together for a reunion for the birth of Wilson's child. Not much has changed! O'Donnell has become a doctor, Griffith a movie star, Moore a writer and Wilson a pink and perky mother to be. This film allows us all to discover how these women came to be and it is actually pretty insightful. So sit back and take yourself on an \\"old school\\" journey back in time. <br /> <br />Soon enough this movie goes back in time to the early 70's when kids could ride bikes all over town, ice cream sodas were the rage, AM radios hung on every handlebar, laughter hung in the air and stories were meant to be told. The young O'Donnell is played by Christina Ricci, a tough tomboy growing up in a family of men because her mother was killed. Ricci is the strong one, the shoulder to cry on, the fighter who would rather play sports than sprout a couple of breasts. Griffith is portrayed as a young girl by Thora Birch and as a youth is fascinated early by sex, fake breasts and being an actress. Birch is the adventurer, the wandering heart and the heartbreaker of the group. Moore's child is played by Gaby Hoffman and she is the quiet, introspective and questioning young girl. Hoffman gets herself in all sorts of dilemmas stemming from the shame of divorced parents who act more like children than she does. Finally Wilson is played by Ashleigh Aston Moore, and of all the girls she remains steadfastly the same in adulthood as in youth, a simple, rather innocent girl surrounded by a perfectionist mother (played by Bonnie Hunt!) and an entire room of pink and lacy curtains.  <br /> <br />The young girls are shown growing up and daring the world, finding where they all belong and how they are alike yet very different. The film brings back great memories of the time through the use of great music and ties to certain events that impacted the generation. The happiness and innocence of the decade is found on the country roads and soda shops as the girls plan their adventures. Silly crushes and fights with boys are inevitable along with all the challenges of growing up imperfect. All of the fun of childhood is represented here, the cemetery sances, tree-house meetings, excursions on bicycles, splashes in the river, sneaking out the bedroom window at night and childhood friendships that should last a lifetime. I found this film inspiring and insightful, but then I came from the same generation so I can totally relate. So I watch it every now and then for the sweetness and the memories of a great childhood. <br />
B00004Y6O4|4.0|Never did any Rod Stewart album generate the kind of love/hate sentiment more than Blondes Have More Fun.  Having already endured criticism, and cries of \\"sellout\\" for moving away from jolly old England, and settling in Los Angeles, and the subsequent cries of \\"sellout\\" for issuing the appropriately titled, \\"Atlantic Crossing\\", Rod dared to join the late 70's and horror of horrors, recorded a so-called disco tune.  The truth is, most rock acts at the time were delving into the disco craze, trying to capitalize financially.  The Stones (Miss You), Kiss (I Was Made For Loving You), Blondie (Heart of Glass), ELO (Entire Xanadu sountrack).  So, criticism of Rod is very harsh, in my opinion.  Especially when you consider that BHMF is a solid rock album on the whole.    <br />  <br />I don't care what anyone says, Do Ya Think I'm Sexy is a great tune!  And, unlike what most people thought, not autobiographical.  As Rod does better than anyone else, he is telling a story.  The lyrics start, \\"He sits alone, waiting for suggestions.\\"  After the mega hit, one kickass rocker, Dirty Weekend is next.  In the style of the great Rod rockers, this one is basically a \\"head's down, meet you at the end in three minutes\\" tune.  Rod displays his self-depricating sense of humour a lot on this album, as evidenced by 'Aint Love a Bitch.  A cute little ditty that you'll be signing the rest of the day.  Rod then slows things down a notch for a nice ballad, Best Days of My Life, before some more self-deprication on the rocking, Is That The Thanks I Get?  <br />  <br />Side Two ( I Love vinyl) is more good stuff.  With the highlights being the humourous (and again self-depricating) Attractive Female Wanted and Last Summer.  You have to wonder if Rod was having trouble keeping girlfriends at the time he recorded this!  Nice uptempo numbers such as the title track and a cover of Standing in the Shadows of Love fill out the cd, and we end with a song called Scarred and Scared.  In my opinion thissong is autobiographical, but I have no idea what the actual story is behind it.    <br />  <br />The story here was that critics pretty much hated this album, but the fans ate it up.  With the exception of Rod purists, who burned their copies of Every Picture Tells A Story in protest...  <br />  <br />Overall this album is worthy of your music catalogue.  Don't be afraid of disco folks.  It's well dead...It's not coming back because you enjoy Do Ya Think I'm Sexy!
B00002E224|5.0|This film is one of the best love stories of all time showing how love can develop from a simple glance or meeting anywhere in the world. <br /> <br />Filmed in Vienna the director has managed to take the conversation between two strangers and the beautiful European setting and make a fabulous romance work. He maintains the simplistic integrity all through the film preferring to keep his characters straightforward and thus open to opportunity. The sophisticated conversation develops over a supposed 14 hour period of time that the two people have together and it is both psychologically deep and interesting. And what can you say about Vienna, a beautiful character in itself, holding all the answers just as it did for Freud. <br /> <br />Ethan Hawke plays an awkward and unsophisticated American who is taking a Eurorail to Vienna in order to fly back home. He has been rambling about Europe not wanting to go home and face the music of his relationship (with an American student in Spain) having come to an end. Hawke is fantastic in this role showing a vulnerability that is sorely lacking in many young men and entirely captivating to women. Hawke meets a fresh faced and luminous Parisian girl, played by Julie Delpy, while on the Eurorail train and they strike up a conversation so interesting that it exists for the entire film and never gets old or tiresome. Delpy is magnetic as a simple young woman with intelligence and a great adventure for life. Together Hawke and Delpy will have you wrapped around their fingers as their hearts become entangled in the beauty of a grown up romance. <br /> <br />If only all strangers were so brilliant to talk to! This easy conversation will leave you pondering the meaning of life and asking yourself or your own loved ones the same questions and hoping for insightful answers. If you love Europe, simple romances and psychology this is the film for you because of its inspiration and profound thinking and of course the beauty of Vienna and theDanube. <br />  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie is one that i would recomend to all Americans. It gives you a good look at \\"W\\" and how he has mislead us to belive that we needed to go to a war. A war based on his and his dady's beliefs. Most of the things in the movie, you would have already known, had you have watched any news source rather than FOX, but it also gives you a deeper look behind the curtin in wich the media has tried to cover up. Altho some things are exagerated, it is for the most and main part, true facts. <br />   Its funny to see all these ultra-conservitaves try to write a review on this movie. Seeing as you can tell by reading the reviews that they have not seen this video. These are the kinda people that make me sick, all they do is listent to people like Bill O'Riley, who tell you not to watch this movie, based on lies that Bill spits, and they carry the message. Bill, and other Fox corespondents, spit out right-wing propaganda constantly. Now you may say \\"well this here movie is propaganda!\\" but it all depends on how you look at it. I think everyone should see it no matter what there political standpoint is. Wether you hate it, or love it, it will give you something to talk about. <br />    Now I'm not a person who only watches and reads leberal movies and books, I enjoy looking at both sides of things. Dont think that I just chater about the evils of dubya. To tell the truth i don't know if Gore could have been the best President. The truth is nobody is perfect, and we will never have the perfect President. They will all make mistakes. But Bush has made one too many mistakes and ones that are major. War is something that should only be done in times were it is the only answer. Oil and money, are not good reasons for war. I wouldn't even call this a war. I pray every night for our troups, and wish them the best of luck, but we can't let this war go on. <br />   Ive been rambling on and need to stop. I hope you will all buy or rent this movie. No matter if your a ultra-right wingneo-nazi or a ultra-leftwing flaming-homosexual (wich by the way i have nothing against homosexuals, but the conservitive right does) you should watch this movie, wether you belive it or not it will make you think about how to make this country a better one.
0553208845|5.0|This beautiful and poetic novel about the life of the Buddha is not about the life of the Buddha, per se, or so Herman Hesse (it's a German name: the final \\"e' is pronounced like a soft English \\"a') would have us believe.  \\"Siddhartha,\\" meaning \\"the accomplished one\\" is one of the traditional names of the Buddha, but in this novel Siddhartha (from the Sanskrit so that the \\"h's\\" are silent) encounters the Buddha in his travels and gains by what he learns from the Enlightened One.  Yet the life so wondrously depicted here is closely patterned after the traditional life of the Buddha, and where it is not, it is highly plausible.  I think Hesse started out to write a life of the Buddha but at some point realized that his sometimes spiritual, sometimes profane depiction might offend some Buddhists, and so he had Gotama, the Perfect One himself, appear as a separate character while keeping the life and the traditional name for his hero.<br /><br />At any rate, this is one of the great novels of the twentieth century, or any century for that matter.  It begins with Siddhartha's royal birth in India in the Sixth Century BCE into a Brahmin's life of privilege and wealth, continues through Siddhartha's traditional discovery of poverty, death, disease and pain as he wanders outside the royal estates, and his consequent desire to conquer or somehow come to terms with what he sees, things he had been sheltered from since birth.  Thus we have the fundamental tenant of Buddhism: Life is suffering.  The scene where the young Siddhartha confronts his father and stands up all night to show his resolve is one of the greatest \\"coming of age\\" scenes ever written.<br /><br />And that is what really makes this novel: the character of Siddhartha himself.  Hesse has created a seeker who is a real life hero: kind, brave, strong of will and decisive, intelligent, modest, confident, honest, hardworking, unprejudiced, self-questioning and sometimes self-doubting, somebody we can identify with and admire.  He goes through the temptations and the travails of life, sometimes weakening and sometimes distracted, finally finding salvation only after he has tried not only asceticism, but indulgence, not just renunciation, but a Tantric-like embracing of all things social and profane.  In a sense this is a generalized life of the true seeker after spiritual enlightenment, a life that pleases not just Buddhists, but Christians and Hindus and those from other faiths as well because it is a portrait of humanity at our finest and our truest, out of the entangled bank and toward the stars.<br /><br />The deceptive simplicity of the story makes it accessible to readers of all ages and walks of life, and greatly rewards a second and a third reading.  In the United States it is often part of a superior high school curriculum.  It is inspirational not only for the spiritually inclined, but for young people of all ages, and in writing it, Hesse did a service for humanity greater than a thousand sermons.<br /><br />I should add that the English translation of the German by Hilda Rosner is itself a work of art, graceful, balanced, every word so natural that one is unaware that the work was written in another language.<br /><br />The story ends with Siddhartha finding the peace that passeth all understanding, learned from a simple ferry boatman as he listens to the timeless voice of the river as it flows, expressing all that is or has been or will be.th and admire.

B000002GBK|1.0|This piece of pretentiousness highlights what was so wrong with the original prog movement. Holed up in ivory towers, fat of wallet and fat of drugs, the music Wakeman, and co-offenders Emerson Lake & Palmer (An entire album about an armadillo-monster thingy - WTF?!) produced, was disconnected from ordinary people, to the point where many could simply not relate to it. Punk rock did not care about winning awards or commercial success, and sought to break down the barriers between audience and band, using a simple approach favored by the likes of the Stooges, & the Motor City 5, rather than performing, as Wakeman did, the King Arthur stage show, with a huge cast of knights on hobbyhorses - on ice! with Wakeman himself dressed up as Merlin. I dont have anything against prog rock in general; i am a big fan of Pink Floyd & Rush, & i also like the new prog-influenced bands or today, such as Coheed & Cambria, Cave In, & Dream Theater, as well as a healthy selection of punk rock, heavy metal, & electronic music. If you want good old-school prog rock, i recommend Rush's \\"2112\\", or Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", but whatever you do, stay away from this!
B00005A0N5|5.0|This is the first album ive owned by nightwish. I think they are brilliant! The best power metal if not the best metal band of all time. <br /> <br />I won't song by song here cuz they are all great.. really they are.. but here are my favourites (the ones that make my playlist all the time) <br /> <br /> <br />2. Gethsemane: One of my favourites off the cd. Beautiful chorus. <br /> <br />3. Devil & The Deep Dark Ocean: The best (on par with Pharoah sails to orion) song on this album. Perfection in all its forms. I love the contrast of the male and female vocals here. <br /> <br />5. Passion and the opera: this one is a bit different. still awesome!! <br /> <br />8. The Riddler: I love this song except the first part of the verses though. <br /> <br />9. The Pharaoh Sails To Orion: Perfection. My personal favourite. The piano part is awesome. Just everything about this song rocks! <br /> <br />Though i am now the proud owner of all nightwish's \\"major' albums, i still hear this one alot!!! If you don't own any nightwish cds yet, i recommend this one and wishmaster.
B000286S8S|5.0|Jeez, I have to say but this album totally reeks of awesomeness. You no longer have to go and look on Van Halen's old albums to go and find all songs. Because they are all on this cd. <br /> <br />Van Halen has 3 live recordings on this cd, \\"Ain't talkin bout love\\", \\"Jump\\", and \\"Panama\\". Those 3 are sung by Sammy Hagar, since he's now the lead singer, and has been for about 12 years. Eventhough Sammy Hagar is the lead singer, they still have good ol' David Lee Roth. You can still hear him do his awesome screams like in Panama and Jump. I still think that Sammy Hagar kicks David Lee Roth's boot off the charts. Basically, if you want Van Halen's old hits, they are all here. And you can't find a better Van Halen cd.
B000002H2H|5.0|If Metallica never made Master Of Puppetrs then this would be their best. Here' a rating of the songs:<br /><br />1. Fight Fire With Fire 5/5<br /><br />2.

B000002L99|5.0|Well, this is the all time best cd by Van Halen. Dreams used to be my favorite song on this cd, but Summer Nights is the best song. It just has that perfect catch, and rock feeling. Dreams is an awesome song, and I'll always love it. Love Walks in is a nice calm song that'll make you think, \\"wow, this is the best love song.\\" Best of Both Worlds and 5150 are also great songs. Can't live without them. Get up and Good Enough are great songs also. Good Enough is just a song to have fun with. Inside is an interesting song. And Why can't this be love is my 3rd favorite song. <br /> <br />I think that Sammy Hagar kicks David Lee Roth's butt right off the charts. Roth may be the more interesting singer, but Sammy Hagar gives his all for songs. I think in Dreams he gives it his all. While he has fun in Summer Nights, and Good Enough. To anyone who wants rock, you should get this cd. And, you should also get Van Halen's new cd \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\".

B000002I25|5.0|This is one of the most amazing albums of all time. It combines a mindblowing fusion of jazz,blues,rock and poetry together to create the most unique music i have ever head. Every single band member plays there instrument evenly unlike alot of other music where its completely based around guitar. This is probally the only album i can listen to from begginging to end and enjoy every peice of music.
B00005JNA2|5.0|Nine years later in 'real' and production time, this one reflects the changed concerns of the protagonists (as scripted by director and actors). But all the, often tendentious, chatter is just a device for Jessie and Celine to make contact again. People in an urban setting make contact through talking, and very rarely indeed through silence and meaningful gazing into each other's eyes. Talk: at the same time a barrier as a bridge. And in between the superficial issues-related chitchat and ponderings, the important things finally bubble to the surface, and there is communication. How he saw her everywhere. How he actually SAW her, but couldn't believe that he did. How she looked for him in her other relationships but never found him.<br /><br />I'm not a friend of 'talkies', and most likely never will be. BEFORE SUNRISE and BEFORE SUNSET are the two exceptions that managed to get through my aversion; no doubt mainly because the content of the talking mattered little. They could have chatted about anything, as long as it served to bring them together.<br /><br />\\"You're going to miss your plane.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know.\\"<br /><br />As far as last lines go, this one's right up there among the greats in the romance/romantic-comedy genre; possibly even higher than THE SURE THING's...<br /><br />\\"You didn't sleep with her.\\"<br /><br />\\"She wasn't my type.\\"<br /><br />A screenwriter always looks for the great opening and closing lines.

B000002MY3|5.0|That lyric could be a major summary of this album's effect and intent. <br />Whether screaming for joy, for effect, or out of pure rage, Alanis Morissette stood out immediately as a musician without pretension, who definitely meant business. <br />Her lyrics capture both the virtuosic and the awkward at once, and provide us with an immediate window to her, and our, senses of self, without the censorship of more commerical, insipid performers. <br />She rants with a venemous tongue over thoroughly ravaging rock and roll energy, yodels with odd fervor and refreshing sarcasm, and whimpers, piercingly to the heart, observant tales of emotional scenery at a specific time. <br />She seemingly effortlessly plunges ahead with our least loved conflicts and somehow makes us better for it, whether syncopated, frustrated, or devastated. <br />This record is something to remember.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I can't begin to say how excited I am that they are finally releasing the original trilogy on dvd! I don't see how difficult it would be to put both versions out. The original for sentimental reasons. I saw A New Hope when I was six years old in '77. I was awestruck. I'm actually quite curious of the new things they're putting in. I'm not too sure how it's going to work out with Hayden's face being put over Sebastion Shall's at the end of Jedi. I hope it won't be a destraction. The only thing I completely dislike above everything else, is Greedo shooting first in ANH. That is absolutley insane! For just a split second, it looks like a wax dummy of Harrison Ford. But other than that, I think I can live with the changes. One thing I hope they add to ANH; In the trash compactor scene, right after the creature under water makes it's sound, Luke turns around and MOUTHS \\"what was that?\\" You can't hear him, there is no dialogue. Just watch and you'll see what I mean. That has bugged me for ever.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|This is an album passionate, cynical, and vulnerable all at once. <br />With her deft, yet rambling piano, much like the vibrations in her voice, she croons the yarns of relationship patterns she has come to know all too well. <br />Alternately bouncy, booming, light, and angry, this is quality pop music, and should be standard in its field, which has become all too ridden with those who pretend to have talent. <br />Fiona's attitudes may appear somewhat threatening, but can't we all feel so when it comes to some issues? <br />More young musicians should realize how silly they look compared to her accomplishments.
B000002L99|5.0|First off I want to say that I have nothing against Roth and the older Van Halen albums of the late 70's and early 1980's.  1984 is a great album in it's own right Roth and Van Halen were at their peak no doubt!  But then a funny thing happened and in early 1985 Roth left (or was fired from the band depending on who you believe.) Sammy Hagar was hired to replace Roth in a move that at the time suprised the rock world.  I was only about 8 years old when all this happened  so yes I am a youngin, but I do know my rock.  I actually picked this cd up about 9 years ago in a reduced bin at the local record store and it's the best 7 bucks I ever spent. \\"Get Up\\" and \\"Inside\\" are the only tracks that I don't get into to be honest.  But the rest of them to me are just perfect even if they have the mid-80's synth going on that some people hate and the electronic drums too.  This album has my favorite Van Halen song of all time \\"Love Walks In\\".  It's slow and it's heavy on the synth pop but I love it!  This song never gets old to me.  Most of this Cd for that matter never gets old.  This to me was the perfect album for them to put out at that time because everyone thought that Van Halen would have a drop-off after Roth left.  They totally didn't at all just judging by record sales on their post Roth albums is proof of that.  So, if you haven't heard this cd give it a try because it's worth it.  I just wish they would remaster this CD and OU812 because they sound so much better on the Best of Both Worlds remastered Cd that came out in July.
B00028HBKM|2.0|Before I go any further, I would like to point out that I subscribe to the atheistic belief that \\"there is, nor has there ever been a god or gods\\". However when I first heard about this film's release, I was quick to inquire about the times it would be playing at the nearest multiplex on the release date. I was curious to see what spin this director (Gibson) would put on the telling of the story of the Christ. It so happens that I also subscibe to the \\"don't knock it till you've tried it\\" theory. <br /> <br />Fast foward to the last twenty minutes of the film (the crucifixion scene), I'm thinking \\"okay...this is pretty okay. Not the greatest film ever, but good.\\"  <br /> <br />Fast foward one hour later, Im thinking \\"okay... so is there anything new I have learned from this film?\\" The answer to that question was NO! <br /> <br />Fast forward two days later (the film tends to stay with you for a while), I'm thinking \\"okay... so what happens in the film? A man gets arrested, prosecuted, beat the crap from and crucified. Is that it? Isn't there any thing else for me to take with me? Suprisingly to me, the answer was NO! <br /> <br />So why the heck did I think the film was pretty good in the first place?  <br /> <br />I then came up with the idea to find everything that was good about the film, so I could better understand why I felt it was good in the first place. <br /> <br />I thought about this for days, till finally I came up with one thing good about the film. The VISUALS! I pondered a few more days. Nothing else came up. <br /> <br />Wow, so this is all the movie is. Visually stunning and nothing else.  <br /> <br />To me, this story is just the unfortunate death of a young man who got himself killed by stirring up controversy proclaiming to be a god of some kind.  <br /> <br />Maybe the overtly religious will see someting in this lackluster of a film. Not me.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Great movie, too bad the greedy suits got their way.    I want to thank those reviewers that warned me about this edition and its enforced ADWARE. I am so angry about this practice I could chew nails. It is MY TV, it is MY DVD PLAYER, it is MY ELECTRICITY, it is MY HOME, and it is MY TIME. If this industry wishes to receive any more of MY MONEY, they will have to start treating me as if I am an individual with the right to choose how I watch movies and when. I'm voting with my cash.
B0002I831S|5.0|I've seen every episode of the original series, and I don't believe what the \\"T\\" stands for in \\"James T. Kirk\\" is ever revealed in any episode. I'm certain, however, that \\"James Tiberius Kirk\\" was mentioned more than once in the Star Trek animated series that followed it. And the middle name was later confirmed in the movie Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, when Chang calls Kirk by that name at his trial -- a rare nod to the animated series. <br /> <br />The original series rocks, by the way -- especially Season 1. Buy this set.
0767802519|5.0|Leon, (a professional cleaner)and his annoying neighbor Matilda become an unlikely pair after Matilda's family is brutally murdered over missing cocaine.<br /><br />The acting by each of the characters is PHE-NO-ME-NAL!<br /><br />Leon, comes off as this unattached killer, who really does an excellent job at his job.<br /><br />Matilda this 12-year-old streetwise girl appears too be so DAMN wise, I mean way beyond her years.<br /><br />Stansfield The DIRTY D.E.A is 100% uninhibited! I mean he's popping pills, singing Beethoven, laughing and shooting anyone he's completely N-U-T-S!<br /><br />As you watch this, violence and all every single part seems to draw you in. Leon saves Matilda (more than a couple of times) she realizes that if it wasn't for him she'd be dead. So she latches on to her kindly neighbor, while they both adjust to understanding one another. I mean even with the violence, and the fact that he's training her to clean professionally it warms the heart as they grow to love one another. STRICTLY platonic for Leon, but Matilda's feelings are of a first love, as she boldly tells him. Seeing this girl, and her strong feelings, dealing with all of the loss, the awareness of love, Matilda literally stole the movie with her raw emotions for Leon, as well as her little brother.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.......
B00005O5CM|4.0|Who doesn't love a feel good movie?  We all do...and this one is no exception.   <br /> <br />Reese plays a very typical blonde who decides to go to law school to win back her boyfriend that dumped her.  As predicted, she falls on her face in the beginning, being scorned and made fun of by her fellow classmates.  She then summons her learning powers and rises to the top.  In the end, everyone is happy...but the old boyfriend who dumped her in the first place!   <br /> <br />This movie has a LOT of laughs, and quite a few cleverly written twists.  Call me a sucker for these, potentially cheesy, types of feel good movies, but they do have a way of brightening your day, even with their simpleness and predictability.
6305205620|2.0|I went to a Metallica concert back in the early 90s when they were at their zenith. It was the best concert I've ever been to. The energy of the band was directed straight into the mosh pit. Fast no nonsense metal from start to finish. <br /> <br />In 'Cunning Stunts' they tried a new arrangement with a multifaceted stage and various gimmicks, but I just don't think it worked. The crowd was all patchy and most of the kids just weren't into it (I mean at the concert I went to back in the 90s there were riot police outside - yes, real RIOT police! With armoured trucks! No kidding).  <br /> <br />Cunning stunts was just embarrassing. Not convincing somehow. Sorry. They just seem so lame. <br /> <br />I give 2 stars because Kurt can still solo. How about some shredding on the next album guys? <br /> <br />
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|This script certainly could use an ambulance!  This movie reminded me of \\"Abandoned\\" with its meandering script.  The whole gist of the script relied on a chance encounter with a dead girl's ghost in the middle of a country road and an ensuing possession of Halle Berry's body.  How much further off the beaten track can you get?  That sequence of events had NO RELATIONSHIP to what had happened in the film thus far.  It was like \\"black fly in your chardonnay\\", to borrow from Alanis Morrisette.  So obtuse and obtrusive, it made the rest of the film dismal to watch.  Plus the ending had offensive twists and turns that were unbelievable and disconnected.  I think the best description of this script and direction is Head Cheese.  <br /> <br />The only reason it gets even TWO STARS is for Berry's performance.  She took a shoddy script and made it work the best she could.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I'm so happy Gilmore Girls are out on dvd! It's funny, and cute and heartfelt. It's interesting looking back on the earlier seasons and seeing just how much the show has evolved since. In my opinion every season gets better and better. Although it takes place in this town which seems a little unlikely, the show still has this great sense of realness to it. I know, no one could possible talk as fast and witty as these characters do, and you might think that this could possibly become annoying, but it doesn't it just gets better and how much credit is that to the writers!!!!! This show is a serious work of art, that never gets old. For those of you who are already GG fans, I really enjoyed viewing the Season 1 episodes again, it was neat to flashback to the beginning. For those of you who have never watched the show, I urge you to check it out, you might find some great deals on used Season 1's you never know! One of my biggest motivations for buying this tv show is not only because it's my favorite still airing tv show, but because it something I hope to share with my kids one day. With the wave of reality tv, and a whole lot of other garbage, who knows where tv will be by then. I will treasure this dvd set and someday in my older-age rediscover Stars Hollow.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Do you know what happened when Kafka tried to burn his manuscripts? A friend of him stopped him and saved his work. Doesnt George Lucas has any friends? Come on, this an emergency!!! Spielberg, wherever you are, talk some sense into this guy! George: make all the new sequels, presequels, you want. Cast Britnney Spears as Han & Leia daughter, make a 12 part series of the adventures of the young Jar-jar binks, but leave our original trilogy alone!! Yes, you got that right: OUR. The memories are not just yours buddy. We deserve it, we made you rich.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I own this CD and personally I like it better than Heavier Things. His three best songs \\"No Such Thing\\", \\"Why Georgia\\" and \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" are all my favorite. I wanted this CD because I heard Your Body is a Wonderland on the radio a million times and No Such Thing and I liked it. I'd give this CD 4.5 stars. John Mayer is one of my favorite artists. And the songs are really good. But it's just my opinion.
B00005JLYW|3.0|I was a HUGE fan of the first Charlies Angles.  I thought they handled the remake with alot of inventiveness and pinache, and had alot of fun with the material.  When I heard the same group was getting together to do the sequel I had high hopes that it would have the fun and spirit of the first. <br /> <br />Eh....not so much. <br /> <br />It's not that it's a boring movie...but it's as if it tries SO hard to outdo the first that it falls flat and ends up imploding on it's own parody.  The action shots rely too much on slow motion and tight action shots, so that the audience makes sure they are can be 'wowed'....it's almost the cinematic equivalent of a 4 year old begging you to 'Look at me!'  It tries so hard to bowl the audience over with the stunts that they are obviously set up, and it ends up missing the mark! <br /> <br />It's not a bad movie, but I don't recommend it if you are expecting the fun and originality of Charlie's Angles.  This is a remake that just tries way too hard to outdo the original and ends up looking like a bad knock off.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Babs is the world's greatest Diva.  She also has the world's greatest ego, but you have to admit one thing, love her or hate her, this is a woman who can belt out a song with the best of them and leave you begging for more.<br /><br />Duets is a cracker of a CD with all the best of her many duets from over the years.<br /><br />Who can not remember and sing along with \\"You don't bring me flowers\\" with Neil Diamond, or the toe tapping \\"No more Tears\\" with Donna Summer and Babs beautiful duet with Celine Dion has to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />Some of the songs are new to me, I wasn't aware she had sung with Bryan Adams or Judy Garland for that matter and both songs are worthy of this treasure of a CD.<br /><br />So if you can ignore Mistress Diva's ego, and listen to her music as pure gutsy entertainment from a woman with a voice like honey on marble then you are in for a treat of a life time.
0441172717|5.0|Why another review? Supposedly things are so complicated and sophisticated these days. People know what they like what they don't. Computers need file names and folders. So publishers need categories, writers need to stay in them. Parents get pleased when the child learns to color inside the lines, conformity is rewarded. But what of art? <br />   Some think Homer never existed. Some think he was blind. We all know he did not put pen to paper. Yet all lists of the greatest literature of all time show the Iliad and the Odyssey at the top. And supposedly they were only two of many that did not survive the fire in Alexandria. But the tales were just songs, people heard them, memorized them, some wrote them down, more learned them, the writings got lost, things changed, poems got translated, and so on and so on. Has this reviewr lost the thread? <br />   Dune is mythology, an epic tale. Mr. Herbert left the building, went some where else so he could show the myths of our civilization. Those that had grown since the time of Homer. Homer wrote of the myths that had preceeded him, perhaps by 500 years. Mr. Herbert writes of the myths that arose over the last 2500 years. To do this he went to Dune. As Archimedes demonstrated you must go to another place to find the leverage to move the world. <br />   Now we can wait and see over the next 2000 years if this epic tale as deep as any I know of, can have the legs Homer has shown already. But I must admit I was inspired by this book. Not bad for $7.99? Perhaps you will too. But it helps to live in a rain forest.
B0000542DJ|4.0|There's a lot to like about this film--the direction and editing are fantastic, many of the performances are very good.  Kevin Coster is a little out of his depth, but since he plays the investigator that leads us through the conspiracy theories his usual blandness is excusable.  The standout for me was Gary Oldman's performance as Lee Harvey Oswald.  I didn't even recognize him at first because of his perfect accent, mannerisms, etc.  Take the \\"facts\\" with a grain of salt and enjoy the cinematic experience.
B00006BIO0|5.0|First, if you have the money, buy the Revenant set please. As you may know, JSP is an importer who 'borrows' their material from other sources, does a little EQ and sells it without paying royalties (completely legal in Europe). Now, I prefer these remasters to the Yazoo versions available, its just too much hiss for my taste. Charley Patton is one of a handful of artists that are essential in every serious music lover collection along with Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley, Charlie Parker, Robert Johnson, Billie Holiday, Ellington, among others. Beware: this stuff is old, and not preety, rather scary. Its like drinking straight whiskey for the first time, so be prepared and take a few shots at this. Hopefully you'll find this is as good as the blues gets.
0345357116|3.0|you'll love this one.  On the plus side, I found it very useful for bedtime reading -- it definitely did not keep me awake.  The laconic prose and tersely developed and emotionally inaccessible characters left me saying, \\"who cares what happens next.\\" <br /> <br />If you are looking for something interesting that you can connect with in the same way as the Hobbit or the Ring trilogy, you might be disappointed with this.  If you are just really into the whole Tolkien fantasy realm and/or you enjoy folk epic literature, you'll probably enjoy this more than I did.
0802130208|5.0|Like its main character, the formidable Ignatius J. Reilly, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is brilliant, difficult, megalomaniacal, insane, hilarious, offensive, bloated, impossible, and completely entertaining. <br /> <br />And above all, huge. Ignatius, an over-educated, delusional lump of a creature, could be seen as a symbol, but he's much more entertaining as a character. He's essentially insane, and unlike most protagonists, he never changes. But he certainly changes the lives of everyone lucky/unlucky enough to interact with him. If he ever finishes his opus, \\"Journal of a Working Boy,\\" I'll be first in line to read it. <br /> <br />\\"Dunces\\" is a no-holds-barred literary satire, one which finds targets everywhere. No ethnic or minority group is safe from Toole's pen - particularly the bourgeoisie. But look a little deeper and you'll see that Toole isn't indulging in stereotypes, but turning them upside-down. You can be offended by his depictions of blacks, gays, women - and men, for that matter - but in the anything-goes world that he created, all is fair in love and war, and this is certainly war.  <br /> <br />At the risk of sounding pretentious, I think \\"Dunces\\" is a comic \\"Moby Dick,\\" a big transcendental THING that proves the power of words. At the risk of sounding superficial, I'll say I laughed out loud a LOT reading \\"Dunces.\\" And at the risk of my sanity, I'll say the world needs more Ignatius J. Reillys. And Mancusos, and Jones, and even Minkoffs.  <br /> <br />Oh...and does anyone else think Comic Book Guy is based directly on Ignatius? <br /> <br />
B00028HBKC|5.0|I've always thought about the crucifixion of Jesus and how it must have been, but this film opened up my mind to the fact that I was paid for with a tremendous price and that I should live my life that way.  This movie really drove another point home for me as well:  Our lives are not our own.  The worst phrase I've ever heard in my life is \\"my body, my choice\\".  We do not belong to ourselves.  We are indebted to God, and to everyone, such as parents, teachers, uncles, aunts, grandparents, friends, and country, anyone who have ever given us any amount of their precious time.  We are responsible for honoring God, family and those people fore mentioned with our lives. <br /> <br />This movie really made God more real for me.  I believe that was Mel Gibson's intention and why it's done so well.  I recommend this movie to anyone wanting to understand why Christians love Jesus so much.  We believe He did this for us. <br />
B000002KHF|5.0|This album is quite simply a classic among classics. Fanatics may choose another album of his as the best, but most would say this is. Honestly, I'd take this over his \\"Best Of\\" anyday. This in itself really is a best of. Not only does this also include \\"Moondance\\" and \\"And It Stoned Me\\" like his collection does, but more importantly it has \\"Crazy Love\\", \\"Caravan\\", \\"Everyone\\", and \\"Glad Tidings\\", which the other misses. Plus there's the amazing \\"Into The Mystic\\" as well. This album may only be ten tracks, but every one of them is excellent and moving. I'll never forget listening to this while driving through the California redwoods. Again, a total classic, and \\"Van\\" is the man.
020530902X|5.0|Attention students it's that time of year again. The air is crisp; football is on Satuarday and you need to get that paper done. So hoop to it, its time to get out of that fall daze you are in and get back to work; learn new wonderful things about this world. And what does that entail?  Writing, that's right.  Now as you run off and pay big $$$$ for all of those textbooks (high school seniors you have 12 months and counting) buy this little book and use it.  Your English professor will be surprised, along with your parents.  And guess what?  So will you my young friend when you learn to write good.<br />Yes I know its bad grammar, but I did not have MTV when I went to high school.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This album is exactly what its title indicates, a collection of the group's greatest hits, and not necessarily of their best work.  Being more of a casual GnR fan, I have been waiting for something like this to be released for nearly six years.  This has all of the songs that were popular for the band during the late 80s and early 90s.  And yes, of course a few cover songs are included along with a number of their own original songs.  But I remember both \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" and \\"Live and Let Die\\" being very popular when they were released on the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums.  At the time I did not realize that they were cover songs, but that knowledge in years since has not reduced GnR's interpretation of these great songs.  All in all, I found this album to be exactly what I had been waiting for, but the die-hard GnR fan looking for a \\"Best of\\"-album will likely be disappointed.
B0000256KE|4.0|Brian Eno leaves an indelible mark on almost anything he touches, and Roxy Music was no exception. Even on their first album, one can hear two powerful sides of the band: Ferry's penchant for suave pop songs and Eno's more eccentric musical leanings. These elements would normally clash, but somehow they work brilliantly here. And the album's poetic-sometimes-goofy lyrics fit the mix perfectly, from a song about a strange new dance to a song about having a disturbing obsession with a sex doll (a metaphor for emptiness, etc?).  Those who like their glam rock rough around the edges will definitely find joy in For Your Pleasure.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|After buying Alan's latest release, I now regret not getting the upgraded stereo in my car.  Those who are intoxicated by the ethereal sound of instrumental works from the Alan Parsons Project and Alan's post-Project works should add this album to their collection.  If you liked the pulsating electronica of \\"Apollo\\" from the On Air album, you'll find much of the genre repeated throughout A Valid Path.  Alan has remixed a couple of his earlier Project tracks with surprising freshness (\\"Mammagamma '04\\" and \\"A Recurring Dream within a Dream\\") that will cause others to think a new dance club has opened around the corner.  At worst, some of the songs with vocals may sound a bit Pop/Top 40 (think \\"In the Real World\\" from the Stereotomy album), yet those tracks lend to the eclectic, often esoteric flavor of Parsons' compositions.  This album is a noticeable step up from the 1999 release \\"Time Machine\\" and reminds me of Peter Gabriel's \\"Passion: The Last Temptation of Christ\\".  I highly recommend both to listeners of instrumental and progressive rock music.
B0001RVTXO|4.0|Alot of people like me probably have their previous collection \\"Death To The Pixies\\". The advantage to that is it comes with an excellent live disc, as well as the hits disc. However, as far as the hits discs go, this is the better one. It's roughly the same, but it has 6 more songs. Besides the bigger tracks like \\"Where Is My Mind?\\", \\"Monkey Gone To Heaven\\", \\"Here Comes Your Man\\", and \\"Dig For Fire\\", this disc also has the choice cuts \\"Hey\\", \\"Into The White\\", \\"Alec Eiffel\\", and a cover of \\"Winterlong\\" (Neil Young). It may not all be their best, but it's 23 of their best tracks on 1 disc, and that's hard to beat. It'll go great with your \\"Dinosaur Jr.\\" and \\"Sonic Youth\\" albums.
B000089RVR|4.0|Excellent album, not quite as good as the first one, so I took away a star, but I'm already feeling guilty about it.<br /><br />I saw Dido live some months ago.  She's pure energy, her voice is magical and wonderful and beautiful and sexy and \\"wow\\".<br /><br />There's already enough reviews about this album, so I shan't go into detail, if you liked the first one, you'll most likely like this one too.  If you haven't listened to the first album, you're missing out.<br /><br />Compared to most stuff out there, this is a five, but I don't want to over sell it.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This album is great!! In the above reviews, reviewers have been asking 'Where's the new album?' Well, the new album has been shelved - by Sony!! Of all the marketing and advertising gurus they have, they can't think of a way to market it - or figure out which singles to release. Therefore, it's on hiatus. Isn't that horrible?? We should all email Sony and let them know that we love and want Fiona!!
B00008S2VG|1.0|I never imagined myself disliking Madonna so much but I have. Her recent incarnation has really turned me off to her music. Her latest album \\"American Life\\" is the most pretentious, self-absorbed POS I have ever heard in my entire 30 years of life. I must admit that I used to like this album but the more I listened to it, the more I grew to loathe the stupid lyrics. Musically, the album isn't bad. I love the blend of folk and techno music. Lyrically \\"American Life\\" is a bunch of rubbish. The rap at the end of \\"American Life\\" is so not funny. If Madonna was trying to poke fun at herself, she did an amazing job at it because all her attempts at rapping did for her was make me laugh AT her, not WITH her. I have to admit I do like \\"Die Another Day\\". Although it wasn't the best Bond theme song but it is quite a catchy dance song that Madonna is famous for. It is amazing how far Madonna has come from since \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Like a Virgin\\". Now we're stuck with this self-absorbed, alleged expert on kabbalah who kissed Britney at the 2003 MTV VMAs (which was would have worked during Madonna's \\"Erotica\\"/\\"Sex\\" book years). Madonna's songwriting has really turned for the worse on this album, namely on songs like \\"I'm So Stupid\\" and \\"Love Profusion\\". The one song that I still love is \\"Nothing Fails\\". Lyrically it is just as pretentious and self-absorbed as any of the songs on the album but musically I love the ballad. If this is what to expect from Madonna on future cds, consider me a former fan. \\"American Life\\" is such a turkey for the former queen of pop. The woman needs to revamp her image again. No wonder this album barely sold gold. She didn't only upset this fan but millions of other Madonna fans. Esther, Madonna, whoever you are, please go back to your ol' Boy Toy phase. I had enough of this spiritual Madonna for one lifetime. This is just my opinion though. I am not jealous nor a hater. The only thing I hate about this album is the atrocious lyrics which really sunk the entire album to a 1 star rating. I know Madonna's songwriting skills have never been her strength in general but at least they were fun, not this excruciatingly painful to listen to like this entire album.tire album to a 1 star rating. I know Madonna's songwriting skills have never been her strength in general but at least they were fun, not this excruciatingly painful to listen to like this entire album.
0767817478|1.0|if i could id give this a 0 star but sadly i cant this movie is the perfect example of an over budget over raided movie that ended up just ruining the name of godzilla the special effect are great of corse but so what the godzilla looks nothing like the orginal and, get this dostent even have atomic breath one of the best things about godzilla the is similar to the first 1954 movie olny in america and with uninteresting and some time down right stupid charactor exanple: the main charactors girlfreind is so stupid that for her own selfish reasons make hin lose his job. it likes forever for you to finally fully see godzilla and hes not that inpressive another thing is bacsicly the last half of the moive is the characors runing away from godzillas dump babies and in the end godziillas creative death is being shot with normal missles a few times in the nect which wouldnt even scatch the real japanese godzilla so its basically just a big nothing and ill say it again this movie is just and over budget over raided that is just a cheap rip off of the real king of all monsters
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I don't think Let It Be ... Naked is much better than the original Let It Be. The thing that struck me funny was the omission of the song Maggie Mae on Let It Be ... Naked. I enjoyed that song on Let It Be and was dissapointed to find that it was not on Let it Be ... Naked. Overall an OK album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is an unbelievable album one that can't even be compared in \\"Stars\\". You must listen to this album in its entirety to get the whole picture, but each and every song is amazing, listen and love. <br /> <br />The Rebel Rev.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I know I'll burn in hell for criticising this movie, however I feel compelled to warn others...perhaps the devil made me do it. Despite the lofty topic involved, this movie is nothing more than a cinematographyly supurb slasher film. The portrayal in this film of the carnage of Christ is long and drawn out while other interesting and worthy events surrounding the life and death of Christ are not examined at all. The film is gory and tedious. Perhaps the holy rollers of the world will feel validated by this movie for whatever reason, though there are other film choices which portray the story of Christ in a more inspiring way.<br /><br />See this movie if you desire a good dose of religious guilt, otherwise it isn't very entertaining or enlightening.

B000005JAB|5.0|No use thumbing the pages of Cale's elegant scrapbook of an autobiography, 'What's Welsh For Zen?, to glean hard data on this one melodic gem. Coming after the heady, if problematic days of the Velvets, there's barely an acknowledgement of it as he strides into his rock format. The abrasive thrashing rock of 'McBeth'(while indicating his imminent direction) serves the one discordant note. Throughout,Cale namedrops to effect learnedness without destroying the mood of a distant past. Language had been severed from lineal meaning, in rock, since Bob went electric. Pete Brown writing for Jack Bruce's towering masterpieces, 'Songs For a Sailor', & 'Harmony Row'; Keith Reid with Procul Harum, were mixing up the lyric medicine, presumably with other pharmacuticals & making sumptuous music on a par with 'Paris 1919'. That date? The birth of Surrealism,(and similar writing to Cale's efforts herein) perhaps? The Russian Revolution? Cale's singing on 1919 had a world weary distance to it, which suited the reflective jabberwocky of the songs; stretched out vowells on,'planing lakes', 'elephants that sing','looking out from here at half past France.' It was far from banal music, however saccharine the orchestral moves from strings, viola & piano Cale painted. These lyrics were baffling but made perfect poetic sense when sung. 'Locusts' was something of a revisiting to this pastoral mood but lacks the roundedness. 'Fragments of a Rainy Season' is a good retrospective concert. And some of the fuge written around the hommage to Andy Warhol is very moving stuff. Go John!

I haven't been able to stop playing it, especially the songs \\"Crush\\" and \\"Over Rated\\". It's like this guy is channeling the late great vocalist Jeff Buckley, mixed with a bit of STevie Wonder and Sam Cooke. What gives?? Why isn't this guy number one with a bullet?? One of life's mysteries. Maybe, like Norah Jones's first effort, this CD will suddenly catch fire this year and win a Grammy (which it SO deserves!).
B000062YB1|5.0|I'm a real big fan of heavy metal, and overall Slayer are one of my all time favorite bands. I have all of Slayer's albums, and overall Seasons Of The Abyss is one album that I can just listen to all over again, it's so awesome. The album kicks off with the classic opener War Esemble which tells about propagandas being used in war, and has rapid drumming from Dave Lombardo and great guitar solos by Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. Other great songs include rapid headbangers such as Hallowed Point and Spirit In Black, Expendable Youth which tells about Gang Violence in America, and Dead Skin Mask which is about notorious serial killer Ed Gein. Singer/Bassist Tom Araya does some excellent singing on that song too. The title track is one of the best songs on the albums, and of course Jeff and Kerry really shred on there. Overall this album is a true headbanging masterpiece. Tom Araya's vocals are just stunning, Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman just shred throughout the night, and Dave Lombardo's fast drumming just rips your heart out. Buy this masterpiece now.
0385510438|3.0|A pleasant and easy to read story with the obligatory bad local boy, poor black matriarch with the wisdom of Solomon and all her children having become professionals, the initially distrusted \\"Northerner\\" from Tennessee, the drunk who can write a good story, and the former reporter, an eccentric who had a thing about obituaries.  Oh, yes, the protagonist also has a strange and unlikable father and a sense of idealism.  Despite the insistence on these stereotypes, it was a worthwhile read.
B00028HBKM|5.0|\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is meant for those who seek a new perspective on the story of Christ's suffering and sacrifice.  Mel Gibson's highly personal film treatment of Christ's last twelve hours is clearly targeted at Christians.  But, \\"The Passion\\" can hardly be described as a niche film, as almost every human being on earth knows at least the outlines of the story of Jesus of Nazareth.  Even atheists and Satanists will bring something to the table.   <br /> <br />Of course, not all will ultimately approve of Mel Gibson's artistic portrait of Christ's passion.  Still, this film will hopefully be a catalyst for a personal meditation on the crucifixion and resurrection.  No Christian with an open heart can walk out of this film unmoved. <br /> <br />Those concerned about whether \\"The Passion\\" is truthful to what is the seminal event of Christianity- indeed, human history - need not be worried.  Yes, Mel Gibson presents what is his personal vision of Christ's last twelve hours, according to his reading of the Gospels.  He also practices a traditional form of Catholicism.  But, while the film is in many ways an expression of Gibson's Catholic faith (e.g. the character of Veronica on the road to Calvary who does not appear in the Bible), his interpretation of the Gospel text is strikingly true to the New Testament telling of Jesus' final hours.   <br /> <br />Gibson also exploits the techniques of cinema to provide the most visceral and lyrical depiction of Christ's suffering, crucifixion, and resurrection that I have ever seen.  Yet, he never treats the story, itself, in an exploitative fashion.  He handles the subject matter with reverence.   <br /> <br />The film does employ some dramatic devices that do not find root in the Gospel accounts.  One example is the depiction of the nature and manifestations of satanic evil.  For instance, the devil is seen trying to tempt Jesus into despair in Gethsemane (Luke 22:43 only mentions an angel comforting Christ), silentlymocking Him during his scourging, and dogging His march to Calvary.  None of this is found in the Gospels.  Yet, is it farfetched to imagine that the same Satan who tempted Christ in the wilderness would also try to sabotage His mission in this most crucial of moments?  After all, the ultimate battle for mankind's collective soul was waged along the path from Gethsemane to Golgotha.  <br /> <br />Everyone needs to be aware that \\"The Passion\\" is almost unbearably violent.  But, that is because most of the movie is concerned with the barbaric and gruesome ritual of crucifixion, with its antecedent torture and degradation.  Moreover, Gibson's stated intent was to confront the viewer's complacency with the enormity of Christ's sacrifice and the unfathomable suffering caused by Original Sin - suffering Christ chose to bear in mankind's stead as the price of atonement.   <br /> <br />The now notorious scourging scene gives new meaning to the passage in Isaiah 52:14, which states: \\"his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men....\\"  But, as authentic as the violence is, the film retains a sense of propriety by refusing to linger over the impact of each and every crack of the whip or thud of hammer against nail.  <br />There is welcomed use of flashbacks and cut-a-ways to other characters during the protracted scourging and crucifixion scenes.  Viewers are, thus, rescued from becoming mere voyeurs to cruelty.    <br /> <br />Critics who charge that \\"The Passion\\" subverts Christianity's essence betray their own misunderstanding of its crux.  Christ's message of love and tolerance is vital to living a good life, and the film does pay homage to it in flashback scenes of the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper; but to de-emphasize the meaning of the cross is to gut Christianity of its reason for existence.  Absent the promise of salvation, with its invitation to redemption through faith in the cross and all that its represents, Christianity becomes little more than a repository for moral platitudes with which no good atheist could disagree.    <br /> <br />Christ's suffering - physical and spiritual - is important because our sins made it necessary and unavoidable.  Ellen G. White, an early leader of the nascent Seventh-Day Adventist church, wrote that \\"[i]t was not alone by dying on the cross that Christ accomplished His work of saving men.  The ignominy and suffering and humiliation was a part of His mission.\\"  That Christ willingly chose to take on that suffering and later die for our sake is the very heart of the greatest love story there is.   <br /> <br />In the end, the film's message can be found in its opening reference to Isaiah 53:5 which reads that Christ was \\"wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities...and with his stripes we are healed.\\"  After watching \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" that verse resonates in a way it never has before. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|america's passivity when it comes to government has been a boon to real progress. while other countries fight tooth and nail for democracy, the united states have one of the lowest voting percentage in the world.   <br /> <br />michael moore should at least be commended for stirring up debate on his views. isn't that what democracy is all about anyway?   <br /> <br />and in the last part when he asked congressmen if they're willing to have their children sent to iraq to fight for their country- and the replies he got really tells us what kind of elitist, self-serving leadership america has that is a far cry from the working grunts that go in day in and day out with work, school, and all other challenges they face. <br /> <br />this movie is definitely lopsided, and quite boring in some parts, but it gets a 5 star for me for at least waking up the americans from their sleep and made them think.
B000002H97|5.0|Even though Metallica's Black Album is more commercial than their other releases from the 80's, but it's still a rock/metal classic, and in my opinion their last great album. It has some of the band's best lyrics ever written, and best known songs such as Enter Sandman, Sad But True, Nothing Else Matters, The Unforgiven, Don't Tread On Me, and Wherever I May Roam which are instant Metallica favs. In my opinion, Load, Re-Load, and their latest effort St.Anger are decent albums, but somehow they just don't compare to the old stuff. Anyway, this album is a real classic that every fan of rock/metal should own. Metallica Rules.
1556589433|4.0|William Styron's great novel by the same name is on my list of the ten best American novels ever. This film, for all the things it has going for it-- and there are many-- does not make my list of ten best movies. First the good: Meryl Streep deserved the Oscar she won for the role of Sophie, the Polish survivor of a Nazi concentration camp. (On the other hand, I think she deserves an Oscar for practically everything she has ever done.) She is totally believable here, never gets out of character, and in spite of the catty critics who always talk about her many accents, her accent here is perfect. Her scenes in the concentration camp are almost too painful to watch. Kevin Kline is great as the tortured, crazed Nathan. (Although this was his first starring role, he has gone on to other fine performances.)The cinamatography is by the brilliant Nestor Amendros, who as best I can tell never shot a bad movie.  Now the less than good: Stingo is miscast although I cannot put my finger on just what is wrong about the way he is portrayed in the movie. I just know his character doesn't always work for me. My chief criticism, which I know is unfair, is that the movie is not the book and pales when compared to Styron's novel. Mr. Styron develops his three principal characters through paragraph after paragraph of details, making them as alive as your next door neighbor. Had I not read the novel, I'm not sure I would have understood Nathan's demons. It's a lot easier to portray a sympathetic schizophrenic (Nathan) in a novel than in a movie; at least Styron does a much better job than does the director here.<br /><br />SOPHIE'S CHOICE, however, is a very beautiful movie and well worth watching-- for as many times as you can endure the pain.

Grasp the boney hand of your robed host and be ushered into the theatre of nightmares...<br /><br />Prologue: Why God Made Fathers.<br /><br />A brutish father berates his boy about possessing a copy of a \\"Creepshow\\" comic book, lifting a hand to him when admonished about the girlie magazines he himself keeps in his underwear drawer. Even with an apology, the man disposes of the boy's precious acquisition in the trash-can outdoors, to which infernal progeny utters his curse, accompanied by his daemonic projection, which leads us into the first tale...<br /><br />I. Father's Day.<br /><br />Family secrets are unearthed at the reading of a will wherein a murdered father takes his revenge upon his killer, his very own sister, as well as his vulturous and pretentious relatives seeking to pick his monetary legacy clean; his rotting corpse rises from the grave to claim his prize...all he wanted was his cake, with an additional main course included on a platter...<br /><br />II. The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill.<br /><br />Stephen King plays an isolated hick who witnesses a meteor fall to earth, and forthwith opportunistically seeks to sell it, in his ignorance, to the so-called \\"Department of Meteors\\" at a local college, but ends up cracking it, thus releasing a luminous alien solution which causes everything it touches to sprout a vicious moss-like substance, including Jordy himself. Fearing doctors will amputate his infected hand, he opts for intoxication instead, and subsequent suicide, but not before receiving a \\"visitation\\"  - a drunken hallucination from his deceased preacher father who appears in a mirror, warning that Jordy not immerse himself in the bathtub, that he would be \\"signing his own death warrant\\", but he does anyway, causing him to be covered in the vegitation, and so perishes, begging \\"God\\" that his luck may be good enough to accomplish this act \\"just this once\\", and so his wish is granted. Amusingly, the constant and ubiquitous drone of the Letharginator announces increased rainfall, upon which the green plague subsists and spreads; ironically commenting to viewers that the county will turn green so fast, that it will be miraculous...<br /><br />III. Something to Tide You Over.<br /><br />A man named \\"Richard\\" {Leslie Nielsen} gains revenge upon his cheating wife by burying she and her lover \\"Harry\\" {Ted Danson} to the neck at the beach at low tide; which will of course, eventually yield full saturation, and it is all recorded on film for his entertainment. As an additionally amusing touch, he positions a monitor where Harry can see his adulterous lover being submerged by the waves. He vows revenge, and returns along with the girl, as seaweed-draped zombies seeking his death, to which Richard is driven insane...<br /><br />IV. The Crate.<br /><br />A gutless hen-pecked Professor siezes the opportunity to be rid of his overbearing wife via a demonic creature in a crate, luring her into its jaws that tear limb from limb, after which he ingraciously throws it into the lake, but you just can't keep a good monster down...<br /><br />I must remark about the appearence of this creature, which is one of the most fearsome in cinema to date {kudos to Tom Savini}, almost rivalling Rawhead Rex, and would make for a wonderful pet.<br /><br />V. They're Creeping Up On You.<br /><br />An isolated acarophobic stockbroker penned -up in a skyscraper faces a pernicious legion of roaches who stop at nothing to infest his secured and safe-guarded room, despite his efforts at extermination.

Needling Dad.<br /><br />Two garbage men {the moustached one played by prop-master extraordinnaire Tom Savini} find the Creepshow comic book whichis as Billy's incremental bible, and find that the \\"authentic Voodoo doll\\" offer has been excised to order.

B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica's fourth album And Justice For All is arguably the band's best album from the 80's. From the raw opener Blackened to the speeding closer Dyers Eve this album is excellent despite the producion, but what matters to me is the music. This is the album that introduced former Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted who replaced the late great bass monster Cliff Burton. This album has also got some of singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield's angriest lyrics ever, example from the title track: \\"Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone, pulling your strings, justice is done\\". \\"Seeking no truth, winning is all, find it so grim, so true, so real\\". \\"One\\" is one of the band's best songs ever which starts out slow and moody, then breaks into crushing speed. Kirk Hamett's guitar solos are really awesome on here, and Lars Ulrich's double bass action is very well heard throughout the album. Wonderful album, truly speed metal at it's finest. Metallica Rules, buy this now.

B00000294R|5.0|There have been plenty of MCs with more intelligent and enlightened content to their rhymes than Big L.  There have also been a few (though not many) with more distinct delivery--and perhaps one (Nas circa \\"Illmatic\\"?) with a more natural flow.  But for sheer, unadulterated rhyming skill...there's just no one that touched L.  Ever.  Period.  His gift was so unbelievable that I half wish they would have studied his brain when he died (morbid as it may seem)--because there had to be something abnormal about it.  If anyone in the hip-hop game was ever a bona fide \\"genius\\" in the true sense of the word (meaning blessed with an almost freakish mental gift) it was L.    Don't sleep on the posthumously released \\"The Big Picture,\\" but make no mistake, this grittier and more vibrant first album was L's magnum opus.  Any one of these tracks contains more stunning, astounding, OHHHH (...)!-inducing rhymes than most MCs ever pen in a lifetime.  Just listening to the relentless, incendiary first verses of \\"8 is Enuff\\" and \\"Da Graveyard\\" is enough to blow you straight off your feet.  The numerous collaborators on those tracks are stunning, too, but they're clearly just sweeping up what fragments remain of the mic after L annihilates it.    Accompanying L's absolutely unparallelled talent for rhyme is a penchant for vicious, shock-value lyrics--which is a deadly combination.  The faint of heart do NOT want to pick up this album.  In fact, even the not-faint of heart should be advised--if you're going to be offended by references to cop-killing, child-killing, mother-killing, GRANDmother-killing, NUN-killing, Satanism, general blasphemy, rape and other violence against women...just click on over to another album.  L obviously lived and died under tough, violent circumstances. His music not only reflects it, but magnifies it to the point of satire (one of the sickest things about all this is you'll find yourself LAUGHING at lines like \\"Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gunspray\\").The occasional more thoughtful moment on the album (such as the cautionary \\"Street Struck\\") should reassure you that no, L doesn't really mean all these terrible things.  Is he posing?  I don't know, was Mick Jagger posing when he sang from Satan's perspective in \\"Sympathy for the Devil?\\"  It's my considered opinion that lyricists, writers, poets, etc. have the right to don whatever guises they wish in their quest to enlighten and entertain--and I certainly don't begrudge Big L that right.    This disc sometimes catches flak for having weak production, but I disagree.  The arrangements boast driving drumbeats and basslines to support L's dazzling vocals, while some occasional mellow, jazzy samples round out the tracks with a nice touch of sophistication without crowding L's flow.  Anyone expecting huge, flashy arrangements should pick up \\"The Chronic\\" or something by Handsome Boy Modeling School--this is production designed purely to support the MC, and in my humble opinion it succeeds.    If you have ever nodded your head in appreciation of a rhyme, buy this disc now...but be careful not to break your neck.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Gibson created something of enduring magnificence. He did it with intense focus, and total commitment. The refusal of much of the intelligensia to engage in responsible dialogue about this film revealed immense hypocracy and cynicism. The violence is not a legitimate issue. Prime Time television with it crime show obsessions centered on killing children is so much more truly violent as to make public discussions of the cruelty in the Passion of the Christ ridiculous. The Passion achieves a near impossible goal: the accurate dipiction of a first century execution and an embracing vision of the moment that changed the history of the western world, as remembered by those who insist upon that event's  unchanging religious significance. Whatever your beliefs, or lack of beliefs, it's worth your respect and attention.  It's absurd to think children will be harmed by this movie when network television spews lurid stories of kidnapping, maiming, rape, and murder into our homes every night. The film has set a new and very high standard for religious films and identified a huge audience that hungers for spiritual content in media.

At first glance, you might think that this is going to be schlock, but by rearranging the structure and dropping most of the melodies he makes the songs interesting, unpredictable and almost unrecognizable. Having an all-star band with Michael Brecker, John Scofield, Dave Holland, Jack DeJohnette and Don Alias doesn't hurt either. It's all excellent but my favorite track is Don Henley's \\"New York Minute\\". I bet even Henley wouldn't even recognize it (but still more than happy to get a royalty check for it).

0380002930|5.0|Published in the early 1970s, Watership is one of those great, rare novels that you first discover as a child and then rediscover years later as an adult. Think of Tolkien's The Hobbit or Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. It is the story of exile and myth and the clever touch was to use rabbits-yes, rabbits, the little furry creatures in the fields-as the protagonists and antagonists. When you read this as a child, you enjoy the grand adventure of it all. When you read this later as an adult, you suddenly see grand, serious adult themes that Adams takes very seriously. Consequently, Watership tends to inspire real devotion among its readers.  <br />
B00006RINF|4.0|I discovered Lacuna Coil when they toured with my two favorite bands, P.O.D. and Blindside in May 2004.  After seeing their live performance, I thought they were good, but didn't really think much about them afterwards. <br /> <br />About a month later, I was looking for a little CD collection update...so I bought Comalies.  I'll admit that the first few listens, I was kind of thinking \\"Okay...Swamped is good, but this CD for the most part is bland.\\" <br /> <br />However, luckily Comalies is one of those CDs that grow on you with each listen.  Now I enjoy almost every song from this amazing album.  Stand-out tracks are \\"Swamped\\", \\"Self Deception\\", \\"Unspoken\\", \\"Entwined\\", and MOST OF ALL...\\"The Ghost Woman And The Hunter.\\"  That haunting ballad is the most beautiful showcase of Cristina Scabbia's vocals, and everytime I listen to it, I like it more. <br /> <br />The thing that disgusts me is that it's impossible to  read a review of Evanescence without the mention of Lacuna Coil, and it's impossible to read a review of Lacuna Coil without the mention of Evanescence.  It's like a Christina/Britney thing:   they're compared, but they have NOTHING in common.  The only things that I can think of that Amy Lee and Cristina Scabbia have in common are:  they're both female, and they're both talented.  End of story.  Otherwise, their vocal styles, lyrics, and band's music are completely different. <br /> <br />Many people are failing to remember that there ARE other members of Lacuna Coil other than Cristina.  Andrea (\\"Andy\\") Ferro, the co-lead male vocalist is pretty awesome.  At first listen, one might be turned off from LC's music because his voice is one of those that grows on you with time (kind of like this album).  However, in certain songs (especially \\"Entwined\\"), their vocals complement one another very beautifully. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD to anyone who's willing to try out new things.  Lacuna Coil is original, they're talented, and might I add they put on quite a wonderful live show.   Put all pre-conception \\"comparisons\\" to Evanescence aside, and see for yourself.
0679745203|4.0|\\"Lyrical\\" is a term that frequently came up in our book club's discussion of Ondaatje's poetic novel. Set in a Tuscan villa in 1944 as World War II dies down in Italy, this novel is significantly different than the popular movie a few years back. To begin, the often-dense prose style of Ondaatje-a poet and novelist who was born in India, educated in England and immigrated to Canada-does take some time to get used to.  <br /> <br />The novel emerges as the four protagonists play out their drama in the ruined villa. They are Hana, the Canadian nurse; her patient who is burned beyond recognition; Caravaggio, a thief who knows Hana from before the war; and Kip, a young Sikh who spent the war disabling bombs for the British. All the characters have been damaged, physically and spiritually by the demands of war, but the real brilliance of the work may be the desert setting and the drama that unfolds as the English patient recounts his story spent mapping and exploring North Africa before the war. <br /> <br />

Please dont right me off as some religious nut ball because i am an athiest i just have values.  <br /> <br />In anycase, I thought the movie was ok, but just the fact that it won best picture (over the Green Mile -A much better film-) drove me nuts. I love kevin spacey too, but this movie didn't hit home for me and i dont think a good movie should do that. A good movie should appeal to everyone not just the people who judge the academy awards who come from these kind of families. <br /> <br />Anyways just my $0.02
1400034779|4.0|A very unusual and fun detective story, it was voted one of the International Books of the Year by the Times Literary Supplement. This is the first novel in Smith's very popular series about Precious Ramotswe, the only female detective in Botswana. There is a warm human element-matriarchal, even-about the tales that combine to make this novel that is unlike most other detective fiction that you'll read. Smith lived in Botswana and there's a real authenticity to the stories about witch doctors, missing husbands and con men. The book is a bit like the sign Precious has outside her office: \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed for all Parties.\\" The good news is that this is an ongoing series, and the fifth story, The Full Cupboard of Life, has just been released. <br />
B00005JNEI|2.0|The title sums, it up. Michael Moore has been called on so many of the bogus, unfounded, or flat out untrue \\"information\\" that i makes wonder why people still praise his movie if it does nothing but buff their political feelings, even if its not true. Michael Moore aside from being the wealthiest socialist (which in itself is hypocritical), continues to push political propoganda which condemns those who work for their money and makes those who dont out to be victims.  <br /> <br />This man makes me sick to have to recognize him as a fellow american.
0802130208|4.0|Funny, funny, funny, this book won the Toole a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 1981-and for good reason. Ignatius Reilly, Confederacy's central character and quasi-hero, has to be one of the most singular and original literary inventions of the last few decades. He is a modern Don Quixote setting forth upon a series of hilarious misadventures and disasters in and around New Orleans' French Quarter. The caricatures in this novel are both stereotypes and quite real. There's a film version of this finally in the works as we speak. <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Wow! What a great album.  Yes, I agree, the vocals sound a lot like Radiohead, but Muse has a style of its own.  It is more on the techno/trippy side than Radiohead.  Every song on this album I enjoy.  I strongly recommend this album if you like Radiohead, but be prepared to not like Radiohead as much after you've listened to this CD, you'll like Muse better.  Muse would be way more popular than Radiohead if more Americans knew about them.  Ah well, I've found a hidden gem!
B0001AP12G|4.0|I really do like this album. The beats are nice and his lyrics are surprisingly good also. I can listen to every track on this album and not be disappointed. I was getting mad at first because this album was supposed to come out in like mid 2003, but he held it, so he can make himself more of a household name and it worked out beautifully. The only thing I did not like about the album is on the song, Breathe in Breathe out, Ludacris only did the chorus. Can't say anything else bad about this CD.Don't really think its an all time great. But it sure is a delight to listen to.
0316666343|2.0|The book started strong. But, after dragging the story for years out and all the unnecessary stuff like the mother's \\"actions\\", the grandmother appearing from nowhere, it became a total bore. It just was a waste of trees. This book could have been written in maybe 150 pages (at the most).
B0002MB7QW|4.0|Roland Emmerich, known for his smart disaster movies such as Independence Day, pulls it off again with this great film.  As an aspiring climatologist, I was especially glad to see that behind every minor weather problem there was some truth behind it, not necessarily behind the major climate change however.  The story though is more than just about the weather.  In fact it is really just a good tie-in for a father-son relationship in need of healing, or is that vice versa, plus a few other relationships made along the way.  Either way, the special effects were great, not obviously fake, and the relationships that were formed or deepened, although sped up for movie time, were still powerful and as awing as the storm.  This is not just another epic disaster film, and it should not be treated as one.  I found The Day After Tomorrow to be a great and amusing film, and definitely one to kick off the summer blockbuster season.

B000067IZ3|4.0|Like Requiem For A Dream, only not nearly as just outright strange, this movie portrays, not tackles, the tough issue of drugs.  The movie intertwines between most key stages of drug's existence: shipment, distribution, use, and political handlings.  Not only does it cover almost the whole drug chain, but also it covers it both sides of the border.  Benicio Del Toro steals the show as the independent Mexican anti-drug cop.  With his street smarts, he tops all the others.  That is including Catherine Zeta-Jones, who plays the maniacal mother trying to protect her son after discovering her husband has been leading a double life as a drug lord.  In addition, there is Michael Douglas, who does a very good role as the soon to be Head of Drug Operations and father of a drug afflicted daughter.  This movie presents the fact that \\"drugs\\" is a difficult issue that tears apart lives and even kills some.  He does this without ever giving any comic reprieve, so this can be a very heavy movie.  Watch a light comedy afterward, but definitely watch this well-done four-star film.
B000001GBJ|4.0|I actually found out about this album through the Howard Stern show; it's the music they play whenever someone tells a sad story. In the context of the show, it's always amusing when they use these songs (to my knowledge, they've played six of them), but I found myself to be very moved by this music, especially \\"Heartstrings\\" and \\"Papillion\\". I'm sure the rest of the album will continue to grow on me.  <br /> <br />
B0000247D1|5.0|Although I do agree with some of the reviewers in their belief that Wand's approach here does not work as well as it does in, oh, lets say the Eighth Symphony, I still believe that Wand's interpretation is rock-solid, spacious, transparent, and strikingly powerful.  As always, Wand breaths life into the score, making Bruckner sound so alive.  This living quality also allows the listener to appreciate Bruckner's incredible musical architecture.  While so many composers favor the \\"bigger is better\\" approach to Bruckner, I would go as far as to say that, at least in this recording, Wand's tight , transparent, and solid approach brings an almost chamber-like quality to the symphony.  The playing is so focused and so direct that the result is breathtaking.  Although this reading is not as incisive and powerful as Wand's amazing recording of the Eighth Symphony, Wand's forth is certainly one of the best performances out there.
B0002S94OS|4.0|The new Lamb of God album, \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" is an incredible step forward in the ever changing and ever growing genre that we call heavy metal. Lamb of God is one of the top bands in the world and they just solidify that with this great new album. I really look forward to more from them in the future.

B000002W9P|4.0|This one stands out for many reasons: great songs like: future world or twilight of the gods, great guitarts (thanks to Kai Hansen and Michael Weikath), great new metal sound and the amazing sound of Michael Kiske voice. The only thing I can't handle yet is the Charlie Brown mention on Halloween's track. Otherwise, would be GREAT!
0345457684|3.0|Plot Summary: Takeshi Kovacs is \\"killed\\" but in the future, there is no real death unless your stack is also destroyed. As long as your stack is preserved, you can be downloaded or re-sleeved into any flesh. Kovacs is sleeved in the body of a cop who is currently out of his sleeve as part of a sentence. Laurens Bancroft has paid for Kovacs to be sleeved back on Earth to investigate his (Bancroft's) murder that the locals have already closed as a suicide. <br /> <br />Opinion: I was excited about this book due to its many rave reviews and after 30 pages was keenly interested in Kovacs and the investigation. However, for the next 150 pages it was nothing but action and sex. Several new plot elements were introduced but were lost on me due to the never ending stream of peril that Kovacs finds himself in (and not too miraculously escapes from in various ways). I found myself wishing for time to just regroup and maybe have a conversation or 2 that is not punctuated by dead flesh or sex. Much to my surprise, the story got back on track with much less deadly action. So much so that I found myself thinking that Kovacs was acting out of character. Maybe my heart wasn't entirely in it but I found the disjointed leaps of logic by Kovacs lost me several times. I have read the whole book and am still not sure what exactly the chain of events was and who was involved at each point. The future world built by Morgan is very well realized and I find alot of the technology interesing. The world has a Gibson feel to it but I find it much easier to get into than Gibson. I really enjoyed the way all of the technologies were interconnected and used in the story as well as touching on some of the moral dilemmas involved when you have human personalities that can live on indefinately in various \\"sleeves\\". Its a bleak world in Morgan's future. <br /> <br />Recommendation: While the world was very interesting and the story a little strained, I find myself not wanting to read the sequel, Broken Angels. The investigation by Kovacs was jarring and confused and I felt that I cared not a whole lot for any one of the characters. They all seemed slimy to me, and that was probably the point. I would rate this 2.5 out of 5 stars. [As I did not really like Neuromancer either, I would say that this whole cyberpunk style is just not to my taste. If you like William Gibson's works I would bet you will greatly enjoy Morgan's.]
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|I don't have all that many regrets in my life (in part because I don't regret as many things as I probably should). One of the regrets I _do_ have is that I never got to see this particular Tull lineup in concert.<br /><br />It wasn't because I didn't know who they were. I had all of their albums and they were one of my favorite bands. It's just that when the great Anderson-Barre-Glascock-Evan-Palmer-Barlow lineup went kerplooey, I was fifteen years old and hadn't really started attending concerts yet.<br /><br />I've seen Tull several times since then, and the shows have all been good; as long as Anderson and Barre are there, Tull will be worth hearing. But the particular magic of this particular assemblage isn't going to be recaptured.<br /><br />This album (now CD) is about as close as it's now possible to come. And what a marvelous time capsule it is. Even aside from its value as a distant second to the concert experience I never had, it's surely up there with Frank Zappa's _Roxy and Elsewhere_ as one of the great live albums of all time. It's even better now that it's been remastered.<br /><br />Enough from me. If you've read this far, you don't need me to sell it to you; just buy it.
B00005N7Z1|4.0|Robo cop is the story of a detriot police man named murphy.  Who is guned down by somee  band robbers.  Is revived bro back to life by OPC as a cyborg.  This movie is rate R for violence, bad language gore and small amount of sexuality. <br /> <br />A good move this has got to be  the best scifi fi series since terminator..  If you like this I recomend Terminator series and short circut series.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Genius Loves Company is an excellent album.  Ray Charles performs 12 unforgettable duets with artists old and new.  The result is the best album of the year so  far.  This CD will appeal to a lot of listeners,  because each song is performed in a different musical style.<br /><br />  Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of my favorite songs of all time.  Ray performs a very pretty version of this song with the great Johnny Mathis.  These two legendary voices sound so good together.  I loved Ray's duet Sweet Potato Pie with James Taylor  They sound like they are having so much fun singing this lively song.  Do I Ever Cross Your Mind is a very romantic duet Ray sings with Bonnie Raitt.  I love her slow subtle voice paired with Ray Charles very much.  Amother highlight on Genius Loves Company is the beautiful but sad duet Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word with Elton John.  Ray sings a wonderful song entitled Here We Go Again with Norah Jones.  Her smooth pleasant voice sounds so good with Ray Charles here.  Sinners Prayer is an excellent blues duet  I forgot how well BB King could sing, because I'm only famillar with his work as a guitar player.<br /><br />I enjoyed the song Hey Girl very much.  I grew up listening to Michael McDonald's voice in the 70s and 80's. I am glad he was included on this album.  I haven't heard from him in years.  Hey Girl is a very nice duet. It Was A Very Good Year is a very semtimental duet with country legend Willie Nelson.  I really enjoyed this song.  I had so much fun listening to Genius Loves Company.  This album is Ray Charles at his best!
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is one of the most famous anime because besides Ghost in the Shell also another good anime this is one of the first anime ever released in the United States. Akira is a science fiction anime during the 21st century with the world bad enough getting hit and crushing the landscape in the whole world it is survival in the world trying to survive. Well thats just a summary I'm not telling the story so just buy it but be careful with the special edition it might not satisfy you.
B0000062GE|3.0|There are some catchy little angsty rock anthems every now and then that pop up along the way...But otherwise, it's boring and surely a miss. I can't stand the singer's endless whining; and what's wrong with the guitarist? All he plays is the same boring power chords over and over. The style works for some songs, but they could have trimmed a lot off and made it a better album. Drug Store, Save Yourself, Torn Apart, When I'm Dead, and Waking Up Beside You are impressive, but their sound is too anthemic and overly-glossy for me to appreciate.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I really don't know what's happenning in the world, it seems to go back, I mean, people want to travel to the past rather than to the future.  <br /> <br />Boy, the release of these DVDs simply is the best news so far into the 21st century. <br /> <br />Maybe George should have been more comprehensive about the Original Versions/Special Edition issue, but I think that a real fan, one who could have seen the movies thousands of times in all their versions and still LOVE them, does not complain about these little details. <br /> <br />These movies will be the peak of my collection. <br /> <br />Boy, I'm waiting to see these movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXCT|4.0|True, these movies have been around for a long time, but how can all these people write reviews about a DVD set that has yet to be released????? Hmmmm?????  <br />Well, I may as well join the crowd, but my review here really isn't a review of the DVD set (cuz I've not seen it), but a commentary on the ANTICIPATED release and the film itself, based on what I know about it from various sources and announcements, and what I know about the newer release previously put on video. <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to the release of this DVD set, but I, along with most fans my age, am nevertheless very disappointed that it is not also being released in it's original format with NON-digital special FX.  <br /> <br />I wanna see the original miniature models that were shot bluescreen, not the inferior (and very obvious) CGI stuff which just ruined the original work of art. I wanna see the matte lines that were a result of the old optical printers which are now likely in museums. I wanna see those shots that weren't as good as they could have been due to lack of technology or money. It's all part of the original painting. And I won't even talk about those awful \\"tweaks\\" peppering the new version.  <br /> <br />Everyone complained when old B&W movies were \\"colorized\\". That's an easy fix, since you can turn off the color on your TV and still see it in B&W#, but replacing original brush strokes with a computerized substitute is not the way to go as far as I'm concerned. Preserve the original work, don't screw with it. <br /> <br />I don't know about you, but if DaVinci were resurrected from the grave, would we really want him to \\"touch up\\" the Mona Lisa? Would it be the same if he were to destroy the original and paint a new version using Photoshop instead of brushes and guache? I just want the film in it's original format, as seen in 1977 but presented with the quality possible with DVD.  <br /> <br />I must admit that I did like the addition of Luke and Biggs meeting in the Hangar, since all that was just restored original footage. To me though, using CGI for the \\"restored scenes\\" is cheating, and doesn't look like it belongs in the film. If you MUST play with it, just re-shoot the miniatures and do it the old way. At least well done models look more real because they ARE real, handcrafted props. <br /> <br />Yes, George, I'll still buy all the other versions to get all the other goodies on there, just as I did when you released the music soundtracks over and over again, getting me to buy it over and over again to get those extra little bits of music that were added a bit at a time, specifically so that I would buy it over and over again. <br /> <br />Yes, George, I'll help you with your philosophy of \\"why sell it once if you can sell it many times\\". That's OK I guess. If you can, milk it for all it's worth. When people get sick of it they'll stop buying it I guess. <br /> <br />So go ahead and release all the versions, I'll dutifully buy them all, as long as you let us have the complete original version as well. <br /> <br />I give this set four stars. Not because I've seen this specific DVD set, but because I'm familiar with the film, and my review is based on that alone. I would automatically give it five stars if the original, superior version were included. <br /> <br />Jim. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005QW5X|5.0|A friend of mine where I work suggested this film to me. I had never heard of \\"Hedwig\\" before, though I had seen the box cover in numerous places, but never knew it. <br />All I can say is whoa. I mean, WHOA! As rumor has it, Stephen Trask (the lyricist and also an \\"Inch\\" guitar player) first met John Cameron Mitchell on a plane to LA, where the story arose that inspired the two to make a show.  <br /> <br />Hedwig was originally a character developed at Don Hill's popular New York gay/rock nightclub scene, \\"Squeezebox.\\" Mitchell, with the aid of friends like the famed Mistress Formika and Debbie Harry, turned what was described later as a \\"very raw act\\", into a smash hit.  <br /> <br />The dance and song routine turned into a New Tork hotel theater based, off-Broadway rock musical, and, in 2002, was big enough to transform into the phenomenal motion-picture it is today! <br /> <br />In a nutshell, the plot of \\"Hedwig\\" is one of a would-be glam rocker failed transsexual from Communist East Berlin and her search for identity in America, after being dumped in Junction City by the US Army leiutenant who saved him. On the side, Hedwig(Mitchell,formerly German Hansel Schmidt, is on a Z-rate tour with her rock band, \\"The Angry Inch\\" which includes Yitzhak (Miriam Shor, also in drag, but as Hedwig's punk bandana-wearing love) and their agent, an over-the-top hilarious Andrea Martin. The tour is a rebuttal to the teen rock-star oppsite the Angry Inch, Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), whom Hedwid taught everything he knew, and stole everything she had.          (I said a nutshell, did'nt I? Oops!) <br /> <br />Mitchell's direction is suberb, the music is the greatest since \\"Rocky Horror,\\" and the acting has a certain reality hard to find in Hollywood today. <br />The film will leave you stunned til' the last scene, or in tears, and maybe even a lesson or two. Not for the closed-minded though. <br /> <br />Saw it, loved it, now I own it, <br />--GIGI
B0002NRQTS|5.0|Rush's Presto appeared in 1989 and represents the best of their \\"middle\\" period of development (Grace Under Pressure through Roll the Bones) characterized by an new emphasis on melodic inventiveness, a lean, stripped-down, bass \\"lite\\" sound, with keyboards and effects used heavily at times.  It represented a significant departure from the traditional guitar and drum orientation of Rush's first six studio albums and was not welcomed by all fans.  It did, however, produce some very good music, notably on this album, arguably Rush's most orignal effort ever.      Though clearly still a rock album, Presto at times has a somewhat jazzy, funk sound to it, evident immediately on the record's opening track Show Don't Tell, which sounds better in this remastering than the original.  Scars, The Pass, the title track, and Red Tide round out the album's best, though the only real second-tier song is the forgettable War Paint.        Originally, many fans complained about the album's somewhat tinny, reedy sonic qualities.  This remastering has gone aways toward relieving that problem, with a much more \\"present\\" sound to the bass and lower keyboards.  The fact remains, however, that Presto is still not a \\"warm\\" album in the manner of Counterparts or Moving Pictures.  I would characterize the sound as \\"bright\\" and somewhat cold.  Geddy was still using his Wal bass at this time, and whether because of his preferences or the bass itself, the sonic result was a spare, though crystal clear bass line.  Similar results occurred on the Roll The Bones album, which was also produced by Rupert Hine.  Neil and Alex's guitar fills are also captured with great clarity.  The original album was a favorite in terms of Neil's drum sound and this remastering has only improved the result.  I personally enjoy this type of sound because of its clarity, but many others will not and will complain about the brightness and lack of a bottom end to the music.          Presto should be regarded by all as oneof Rush's most original, inventive and unique albums in the 1980's.
B00005K3NR|5.0|DePalma's greatest psychological shocker (and my personal favorite film of all time) is now on Special Release, which includes:     *  Two documentaries (Acting Carrie: The Performance Aspects, and Visualizing Carrie: The nitty-gritty technical side of the Film)  *  interviews with actors and producers of the musical (Broadway's greatest stage failure, by the way)  *  an animated photo-gallery with an accompaniment of Donnagio's breathtaking score  *  and even the original trailer.      Sadly though, a commentary by either Cohen or Depalma, is not offered. But one hardly notices that flaw, amongst all the other long-awaited special items.   The widescreen anamorphic film transfer is a nice touch, and the DVD even includes a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround track to maximize the experience.    For  newcomers to the plot (and by now, there shouldn't be many), \\"Carrie\\" follows suprisingly close to the plot of Stephen King's bestseller--and first novel published--about the torture of introvered high school senior and outcast Carrie White. Aside from her troubled school-life, her religious zealot mother at home doesn't help things, either.   To top it off, Carrie has been invited to the Spring Prom by the hottest guy in school, and a plot to humliate this ugly duckling is soon underway, which proves fatal--very fatal. Turns out the jokes on them; Carrie hides a special gift--she's telekinetic.    The music, scored by Pino Donnagio, suits and brings atmosphere to this classic high school horror film beautifully, DePalma's casting selection was a Godsend, and even after over 27 years, \\"Carrie's\\" bloody hand never gripped us so hard (not to mention Amy Irving's).  I guarantee to any viewer, \\"Carrie\\" is more than just a blockbuster, it's a piece of art--from the curious eye of the camera, to the gut-wrenching special effects--it's everything a thrill-seeker is looking for.    Laurie and Spacek were nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, and why not? Afrter seeingthe finale, you'll think twice before ever laying flowers before a tombstone again!    Last but not least, this movie has been rumored, along with numerous other Depalma classics--to be a tribute to none other than Sir Alfred Hitchcock. With all the unique camera angles, Hermann-ish music, and extremist characters, one wonders if ole' Hitch really did see \\"Carrie.\\" This is, to note, possible since A.H. died in '80, just four years after the release of \\"Family Plot,\\" his last film (Ironically also released in '76).    So, if you're not busy on a Friday night, and want to come flying out of your seat--invite a few friends, turn out the lights, and plug up--I mean stick in--CARRIE.    --GIGI, a Devoted DePalma follower
B00006JIA4|5.0|This collection of Queen songs reflects the bands transformation from small time to super-stardom.    Although some reviewers would like to attack the bands front man, the Late Freddie Mercury for being a homosexual and saying the band is dead doesn't make any point, and doesn't even make a review.      This album covers everything, from oldies like Seven Seas, to songs most haven't heard, like the Under Pressure and Another One Bites The Dust remixes.  Yes... they are a little different, but a nice touch.    Throwing in live performances of some songs (The Show Must go On by Elton John) and some Freddie solo material (Living on my own)    A Collection would be owning every album so if you never plan on getting more than the greatest hits albums I'd say go for gold... or Platinum that is!    It's not about Freddie being gay and dying of AIDS.  It's about a man and a band that changed the world of Rock music.  A band that gave us songs that people could relate to, sing to and dream to.    It's a perfect collection and well worth it!
B0002DB52M|4.0|In two of Lars von Trier's earlier films, Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, the central figure is a pure and heroic woman who gets ravaged by the society in which she lives.  In both films the woman is motivated by totally selfless love, is betrayed by someone she trusts, is stripped of whatever worldly possession she has struggled for, is led to do something unimaginably counter to her nature, is then persecuted by her community, and ultimately condemned to death.<br /><br />Von Trier's film Dogville, set in the eponymous fictional American town by an abandoned silver mine in the Rocky Mountains, shares those same elements, only here he takes the metaphor of a female Jesus figure a step further and provides a new (and gratifying) twist to the formula.  The central female character, Grace, played beautifully by Nicole Kidman, is the daughter of a kind of \\"godfather,\\" and this time, we are given a glimpse of her power from backstage.  Her very first words in the film are, in fact, what Jesus himself must have asked: \\"Is there another way?\\"<br /><br />If it's Von Trier's objective to depict the ways that society will readily maul any creature revealing frailty, he also makes no attempt here to hide his anti-American sentiment.  I'll be more plain: he screams it from the mountaintops.  The ironical voiceover informs us that the retired physician is uninterested in the news of the world, preferring only radio music of \\"the lighter kind\\"; the aspiring engineer was \\"too dumb\\" for his chosen profession; his sister a \\"sweet painful seductive abyss\\"; and the town philosopher Tom, who fancied himself a writer, had yet to actually write anything down on paper.  The symbolism is rife: instead of a cross, Grace is made to bear an iron wagon wheel.  Rape scenes occur among apples: first in an orchard and then framed by spilling apple crates in the back of a flatbed truck on a highway.  When Grace says, \\"If there's any town this world would be better off without, this is it,\\" realize the formula, if you still haven't: Dogville = United States.<br /><br />But von Trier seems confused over who or what he wishes most to condemn: what is the point of the 130 still photographs of scenes of American poverty in the end credits...to the soundtrack of David Bowie's Young Americans?

0440234743|1.0|This book is very disappointing. It has NO climax. I don't know how an author can write a book with no climax, but I guess J.G. thought he could. I just wasted my time and money on this book and it really pisses me off.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Along with Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and the forthcoming Aladdin Disney's Platinum Editions are THE DVD essential. Here is a run down of the rest of the Platinum Editions as they are projected at the moment. <br /> <br />2005: Bambi <br />2006: The Jungle Book  <br />2007: Cinderella <br />2008: The Little Mermaid <br />2009: Lady and the Tramp <br />2010: 101 Dalmatians (animated of course!) <br /> <br />Clearly, with Disney animation floundering at the moment, the studio are investing a lot in their back-catalogue. The Platinum Editions have all been 5 Star releases so far and there's no reason to suspect this will change. As Snow White proved several years ago - just because the film is older than ten years doesn't mean less or more limited extras. Disney have an unrivalled archive and are not afraid to use it!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I am responding on a previous editorial written by user VLR of San Diego, CA I will cut and paste to \\"refresh\\" everyone! The following paragraph is not my review, it is only the review that I am commenting on! <br /> <br /> <br />I know I'll burn in hell for criticising this movie, however I feel compelled to warn others...perhaps the devil made me do it. Despite the lofty topic involved, this movie is nothing more than a cinematographyly supurb slasher film. The portrayal in this film of the carnage of Christ is long and drawn out while other interesting and worthy events surrounding the life and death of Christ are not examined at all. The film is gory and tedious. Perhaps the holy rollers of the world will feel validated by this movie for whatever reason, though there are other film choices which portray the story of Christ in a more inspiring way. <br /> <br /> <br />For anyone that is religious and was religious prior to this movie (or even 9/11) you know what happened with the life of Christ, you know what he suffered and endured in his last days of his life. For someone to write a review on this movie and comment on how \\"horrific and blood shedding and gor-filled\\" it was, you do not know beyond what you are willing to except then. That was his life at the end. They didn't serve him up crumpets and tea, what you see is what he lived. To deny that and try to glorify his life by making it less of what he really endured is denying Christ. Think of that next time you want to watch PBS version of how he walked down the streets with no sweat or tears or blood dripping from his face. I think for someone to really understand and be grateful for what you have today, you need to realize this is what Christ endured for you. So do not deny him that! Do you not know what \\"The Passion\\" is? It is the last days of Christ, it is not the life prior or his resurection, it is the \\"carange\\" (as you put it, that he suffered. If you want to be inspired by Christ and his life, read the bible, go to church, or turn on a religion channel, but do not judge what will or will not inspire people about Christ. It is the agony that he endured that opens alot of peoples eyes and allows them to see just what they have taken for granted their whole lives. Try to be inspired by that!
B0001Z52RU|1.0|From the editorial review...\\"subplots involving child pornography, animal cruelty, and profanely violent children, it's a stretch to call it entertainment\\".  This pretty much says it all.  That and like the characters in this film, we're all better off without Ashton Kutcher.  Stay away from this bad seed unless you want to be depressed for a while.  Or unless \\"subplots involving child pornography, animal cruelty, and profanely violent children\\" or burly men assaulting Ashton Kutcher in prison are your thing.
1594200106|4.0|zafon's novel about a novel and the power it can have and the dark secrets behind it unspool like a classic mystery. when daniel sampere picks up julian carax's shadow of the wind from the cemetery of lost books, he is set on a whirlwind ride that takes him through a few decades of intrigue, deception and at times murder set in the murky depths of barcelona's literary elite.<br /><br />the novel is in many ways about the destructive and redeeming powers of love, both for another person and for books. zafon weaves an interesting narrative that twists and turns to reveal various elements of the plot, however his one weakness is his lack of sense for dialogue. most people speak in a similar way, one that does not do justice either to their character or to their time and place. this one fault aside, zafon displays a great talent for writing page-turning prose mixed with philosophical musings. there are some delightful moments of humour, poignant moments of truth, horrendous moments of fear and finally stark moments of clarity.<br /><br />in all the shadow of the wind is a consummate novel of ideas, and zafon can only get better.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Anyone who has been following heavy metal/metalcore/extreme music knows that Ashes of the Wake is being watched very closely by the entire industry.  After two original, technical, brutal, (and not to mention popular) albums, Major label Epic decided to pick these boys up...making them the most extreme group in the Label's history.  After making the cover of Revolver magazine, MTV's Headbanger's Ball, and various other publications it is safe to say that expectations for this new album have been huge.  Well after one listen through, I am estatic and relieved to say that Ashes of the Wake is easily Lamb of God's best, most accessible, and well produced album of their career; and the boys haven't sold out one bit.  After I finished listening the only other album that I could compare this to in terms of brillance would have to be Metallica's Master of Puppets...it really is that mind-blowing...and I will try to explain why <br /> <br />What makes this album so great? <br /> <br />1.)  Strongest songwriting to date...the lyrics are great, usually revolving around struggle against government, and the internal struggle we all face. <br /> <br />2.)  Variety...One complaint I had about Lamb of God's previous album was that many of the songs kinda blended into one another...most were mid tempo and had the same feel..and all together way to short (the entire album was only 38 minutes long)  This album has a variety of tempos, guitar textures, and even an instrumental track thrown in (With guest appearences by Ex-Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland and Testament's Alex Scholnitz) <br /> <br />3.)  Production Quality...Producer extrodinaire Machine helmed this bad boy, and it shows.  Easily the best sounding Lamb of God album...the drums pummel but are clean and punchy, the guitars are meaty, and Randy's screams have never been more...understandable! <br /> <br />4.)  Groove...This is probably my favorite point of the album...It is loaded with hooks and grooves that make you wantto shake your fist and start moshing it up, making it the most fun and accessible album of their career.  Don't get me wrong...these guys still play brutal and complex metal...but have replaced some of their brooding (Think Meshuggah) with thrash elements (Think Puppets-era Metallica)  Try listening to \\"Laid to Rest\\" or \\"Hourglass\\" without banging your head...its impossible. <br /> <br />Conclusion - Metal album...hell album of the year...anyone who enjoys old Metallica, metalcore, Pantera, Math Metal will find these boys have seamlessly blended all those elements into one hell of an album
0375507256|5.0|david mitchell's cloud atlas is a dizzying tour-de-force of language, ideas and the essence of humanity. in a novel spread across six chapters set in varied times and places, the essence of what makes us human echoes distantly carrying the voices of these lost people through the clouds.  <br /> <br />mitchell employs startlingly different narrative styles to capture the flavour, mood and spirit of each of these times and places.  <br /> <br />The story starts off in mid nineteenth century with an encounter of a distant pacific tribe and a ship from the civilised western world that lands there and moves forward to a shallow composer who aspires for greatness, and in the process composes his rather weird cloud atlas sextet, which echoes in the life of a brave journalist in the mid 1970s who is trying to expose a heinous corporate crime against humanity, whose story is now the obsession of a slightly off-the-hinge fringe publisher aspiring for greatness himself, and his madness strangely providing a genetically modified slave in the near unspecified future, who aspires to break free from the chains that have held her back, with a sublime moment of unexpected freedom and this slave spins further forward in time to be the savior in a post-apocalytic distant future where language, ideas and concepts of freedom and humanity are totally re-evaluated. <br /> <br />mitchell cocoons these stories within each other, so the structure starts with the first plot, leaves it half-way goes to the next leaves it half-way and so on, till it goes to the sixth and completes and takes up the thread in reverse order to finish off the plots ending with the pacific explorer again. while this might sound like a gimmick, mitchells sincerety and talent makes it work sublimely. <br /> <br />these six seemingly disparate plots come together in a startlingly coherent book that is a genuine thrill and delight to read, and not least because of mitchells phenomenal talent for words. although at times, he does tend to carried away with his incredible talent, any reader who follows him down the lane is bound to be rewarded handsomely. this novel does what very few works of fiction can, make you feel better about yourself and leaves you with a golden sliver of hope to hang on to for the future.
B00006879E|4.0|I've owned this CD since last year, but I just recently got around to listening to it.  I'm a member of BMG and they will send you the selection of the month if you don't tell them that you don't want it.  Well I was late returning my form and they sent me this CD.  Since I had already heard \\"This Love\\" a billion times on pop radio, I dismissed them as Jamiroquai ripoffs and I let it sit for months and had every intention of trading it in at my local music outlet just for some extra store credit.  And then, it happened.......one day I said to myself \\"what the hell\\" and I gave it a spin.  That was back in February and I've been listening ever since.  Though this isn't exactly groundbreaking stuff, it's funky and refreshing.  Tracks like \\"The Sun\\" and \\"Sunday Morning\\" are sleeper hits that take this album from good to great.  \\"This Love\\" and \\"Shiver\\" are pretty good and are worthy of radio airplay.  Then there are tracks like \\"Harder To Breathe\\" and \\"Through With You\\" to satisfy the rocker in you.  The singles are good, but the rest of the album is better.  There really aren't many negative things to say about the CD.  I thought the album could've been longer (46 minutes), but it's a worthwhile 46 minutes when compared to the pop crap that's flooding the airwaves.  This album walks the fine lines of rock, R&B, and funk without missing a single step.  CDs like this don't have to be groundbreaking all of the time.  Sometimes they just need to be refreshing and well timed.  This CD accomplishes all of that and then some.  I won't say it's the best CD ever or that it's the album of the year like these other reviewers, but it's definitely a great listen and it was definitely worth my money.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: She Will Be Loved, The Sun, Sunday Morning (My Favorite), This Love, Through With You, Secret, and Harder To Breathe
B00007AJF8|4.0|this movie is totally whacky and wonderful, forget the metaphysical, philosophical meanings and everything else. this is one very hilarious movie. the plot is quirky, but what stands out are the brilliant lines, great situations and absolutely outstanding acting. <br /> <br />****spoilers herein**** <br /> <br />john malkovich is totally mindblowing, when he plays craig schwartz, you see john cusack and not malkovich. truly brilliant. catherine keener has the most attractive role and she does full justice, cameron diaz in a deglamorized role shines. <br /> <br />apart from the acting, the quirky movie is radiant with brilliant humor that makes one laugh out loud. the weirdness of the situations get more and more complex and are very well handled by the director spike jonze. this movie has a terry gilliam feel to it, without going totally overboard. the plot gets quite absurd, but honestly, i didnt care. it was a fun movie. weird, yes, but wonderful
B000000WZ4|5.0|Questo  uno di quei dischi che \\"muove qualcosa dentro...\\" <br />Un perfetto equilibrio di angoscia, dramma, e cuore malinconico. <br />Certamente un opera degna del genio dei DM che, all'alba del 1997, qualora ce ne fosse stato il bisogno, hanno dimostrato di essere ancora in splendida forma mentis. <br />Altamente consigliato l'ascolto a lume di candela.
6305609705|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola'a Apocalypse Now is one of the best war movies ive ever seen. the movie is extremely long (in fact i saw the original version, the redux version is longer!!) - but there is not one moment when it gets boring. the movie is an excellent voyage voyage into the minds of people in war. <br /> <br />martin sheen as captain willard is simply brilliant. Marlon Brando is no great shakes - hes hardly there in the movie. this is a martin sheen movie all the way and he carries it off tremendously aided by the brilliant cinematography and directorial style of the inimitable coppola, who knows how to shock the viewer with his terrific exploration of the shades of grey. one thing that amazes me about coppola's movies - be it godfather, apocalypse now or even dracula - is the way that it portrays neither good nor evil. the chief characters have a bit of both in them. <br /> <br />Apocalypse now is a masterpiece in showing the mental trauma of war. there are many scenes in the movie that will be etched in your memory forever. the chracters are tremendously believable and original. each scene is honest. <br /> <br />The other standout features in the movie are its chilling dialogs and the terrific soundtrack to the movie - coppola uses popular classic rock songs from the sixties to terrific effect, the songs highlight the scenes and add a tremendous aural backdrop to the visual scenes. the songs usually take over during the pauses for the audience to think. the dialogs of course are the ones that make you think anyway, especially the narration. <br /> <br />its hard to discuss the movie without taking away its impact, suffice it to say that this is a movie that will stay with you for a long time. one of the greatest movies of alltime. <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard his single \\"I Don't Want To Be\\" as the theme song of One Tree Hill. The song was stuck in my head for weeks, and so I finally bought the cd! Hands down the best cd I have ever bought. You won't be able to stop listening to these songs!
044022165X|5.0|Ok, granted I haven't read a ton of Grisham.  But I have read a good amount and this is by far the best I've read from him.  I tore through it in about 2 days. <br /> <br />The basic plot was enough to keep me interested.  The sub-plots only made things that much more interesting.  The love story isn't overdone and fits nicely.  I also love the way Grisham makes no apologies for Rudy's seemingly unrealistic good fortune.  He's a likable kid who knows he isn't really worthy of being in the situation he's in.  Things have fallen into place for him and he knows it.  This story line could cause the reader to throw the book down screaming, \\"Oh come on!\\"  But Grisham makes sure this isn't the case. <br /> <br />The courtroom drama itself plays out in such a way that it never becomes boring.  One thing I don't like about some authors is that they often seem to think their reader is fascinated with the same technical details they are (e.g. Clancy and his endless descriptions of ships and guns and such).  Grishman interjects enough technical explanations of the legal system to explain things and keep it interesting.  He never once goes too far.  Through the 500+ pages of this book, I never once put it down because I was growing bored of it. <br /> <br />As a disclaimer, I haven't seen the movie.  I suspect the book is much better, but if you have seen it and already know what's coming next, it may ruin the book for you.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Any believer needs to see this movie.  Mel gave life to this true story.  If you love Jesus, you'll walk away loving him even more.  It gives new meaning to \\"the blood of Christ\\" and \\"being bought for a price\\".  It will renew you as you discover the tremendous sacrifice he gave in order for you to live a happy life. If you're a non-believer, see the movie and perhaps you'll change your mind. To make a long story short, it's very moving and it's a \\"must see\\".  It would make a perfect gift for anyone you cared about.
B000003TA4|4.0|Okay there are 2 reviewers that really got me P.Oed. They were \\"AvrilLavigne#1Fan\\" and \\"MasterShake\\".  <br /> <br />To that fan of the Canadian Poser: You seriously took a piss on Jimi Hendrix's grave. Hendrix had more talent than you have on that pimple on your forehead. Plus, Avril and Kurt are NOT the best guitarists around. So shut the hell up! <br /> <br />To MasterShake: For one thing Nevermind came BEFORE In Utero. Plus, Nirvana came before Puddle of Mudd. So who's copying who now? <br /> <br />Okay about the album. I'd like it alot more if wasn't so overrated. It is still good though. Not the best album of all time however. Led Zeppelin IV could easily squash Nevermind. But it is still the best album of the 90's. Then again the 90's sucked. <br /> <br />R.I.P Jimi Hendrix <br />R.I.P John Bonham <br />R.I.P Kurt Cobain <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|What makes this film sad is this. It shows videos of American soldiers being executed. These soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. And yet instead of honoring and showing our utmost gratitude toward these sacrifices, Michael takes videos of their deaths in his film to help him lie and disrespect their Commander and Chief and our President. <br /> <br />They died for their country not for Michael Moore`s disrespectful film. <br /> <br />And I don`t understand why misinformation can be called lying. I mean if liberating Iraq and capturing terrorist is all a mistake it has to be one of the best mistakes I`ve ever heard of.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|Avril's sophomore album does little to boost her cred. The first album was ok, this album is a little bit below ok. More songs dwell on adult topics (as compared to Let Go songs). However, this I can say is not real punk rock. Nor any kind of rock music. It is plain, commercialized \\"punk rock\\". Radio-friendly songs but I am annoyed when singers (not artists) use the punk/grunge/rock/hiphop image wherein they are not actually immersed in that certain culture.
B0002I831S|5.0|At last, at last, at last, Star Trek: The Original Series is getting a box-set DVD release as it so richly deserves.  It's way overdue, to say the least.  I was a bit too young to see the shows when they were first aired, but I grew up on the reruns in the 70's and bought almost the entire series on VHS when they were first released in the mid-80s (and that was expensive for a high-school kid back then, I can assure you).  Since I owned so many episodes on VHS, I never picked up any of the 2-episode DVDs, despite extreme temptation.  A voice in my head kept saying \\"Wait for the box sets, wait for the box sets...\\"  Well, I don't usually do what the voices in my head say, but I am glad that I did this time.  This series struggled in the ratings on the air and actually only lasted for three seasons before being cancelled in 1969, but the show has since taken on the stuff of legend.  The show's impact on American pop culture is obvious today and shows no signs of ever going away. <br /> <br />The cast of the show were perfect for their roles and had a lot to do with making the show the success it was.  Featured players for the first season included William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock, DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy, James Doohan as Chief Engineer Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott, George Takei as Helmsman Sulu, Nichelle Nichols as Communications Officer Uhura, Grace Lee Whitney as Yeoman Janice Rand, and Majel Barrett as Nurse Christine Chapel (Walter Koenig did not join the show until the second season). <br /> <br />This box set encompasses all of the first-season episodes of the Original Star Trek TV series and were first aired on NBC in 1966-1967.  Today, sci-fi is all over the TV channels, but back then, SF was very rare for an industry dominated by the Western.  In fact, Gene Rodenberry, the series creator, actually helped make his case to NBC to produce the series by saying the show would be like \\"Wagon Train to the stars\\".Well, whatever it took, the series made it on the air.  This first season is generally ackowledged to be overall the best of the three.  Some of the more well-known episodes include: <br /> <br />\\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" - one of the two pilot episodes produced for the series, this show served to introduce Kirk, Spock, Sulu, and Scotty and features a very impressive guest-star performance from Gary Lockwood as First Officer Gary Mitchell. <br /> <br />\\"The Corbomite Manuver\\" - This was the first \\"regular\\" episode produced, and introduced McCoy, Uhura, and Rand, and was the first show to feature Kirk's legendary ability to bluff his way out of the most hopeless situations in the face of death itself. <br /> <br />\\"The Enemy Within\\" - The famous episode where a transporter malfunction spilts Kirk into two halves, one good, the other evil. <br /> <br />\\"Balance of Terror\\" - The episode that introduced the Romulans and gave us what is still one of the best and dramatic \\"space battle\\" episodes in TV history. <br /> <br />\\"Errand of Mercy\\" - Our first look at the Klingons.  No more need be said. <br /> <br />\\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" - A time-travel episode where Kirk, Spock, and McCoy travel back to 1930 New York City and Kirk falls in love with a social worker (played by a young Joan Collins), this love story is considered by many to be the best episode of the series overall. <br /> <br />There are so many other great episodes in this collection, what I wrote above barely scratches the surface.  These episodes are an absolute must-have for any science-fiction fan.
1878424114|5.0|Deepak Chopra brings us the universal truth that I have been fortunate enough to come across a few times already, the laws of conscious creation, cause and effect, giving, and \\"least effort\\" or \\"letting go\\" and allowing our dynamic creations to act in accord with our energy in co-creation, for the highest purposes.  <br />This book is an example to follow, and is a great read!  <br />
1577311523|4.0|There is nothing wrong with praising this book and if there is one thing that I would like to emphasize then how highly readable this book is. The question/answer-format brilliantly anticipates the questions I was just about to ask while reading it, and I was really under the impression that I got it. Great job. What I did not like about the book is the author, he does not seem to be the humble kind.  <br /> <br />\\"When you confer spiritual authority on another person, you must realize that you are allowing them to pick your pocket and sell you your own watch.\\" These words, for example, were written by Alan Watts (\\"Still the mind\\", page 23/24), and Jiddu Krishnamurti writes: \\"We all want to accept somebody who promises something, because we have no light in ourselves. Nobody can give you that light: no guru, no teacher, no saviour, no one. ...... So one must distrust, deny all spiritual authority\\" (In: \\"This light in oneself\\", page 18).  <br /> <br />What I am really getting at is that Tolle obviously did not invent any of what he is talking about (which is okay), but that we are still talking about meditation and Buddhism etc., and he is just one of many teachers. It's been all there a long time. I am just encouraging readers here to look elsewhere as well, it does not need to be published just recently, with nice flashy covers and all that and all this talk, even inside the book, about the \\"world class spiritual teacher\\" that he is... why not let the reader decide.  <br /> <br />\\"I was so stunned by this strange realisation that my mind stopped. I was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what felt like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and then my body started to shake. I heard the words \\"resist nothing\\", as if spoken inside my chest.\\"  <br /> <br />This is what you hear from Tolle in his book, which is strange, because first he describes God (which he calls Being) as an open concept (opposed to a man with a white beard), and all of the sudden I can't help but being under the impression that Tolle wants to make the reader believe that he has been contacted in oh such a metaphysical way by....a higher being or message from space (or whatever...just something that is probably supposed to give him credibility. (\\"Resist nothing\\" also happens to reflect the concept of \\"surrender\\" (buddhism)). But of course he could not have pulled that from other sources or reached this state of wisdom by meditating or something, no, he had to have had an \\"experience\\", and more importantly share it with his readers, and over night became a \\"spiritual teacher\\" (a world-class one, of course..).  <br /> <br />For me, it all boils down to: Sometimes a former player of whatever sports will be a good coach (teacher) later but not necessarily so, but in a case like this it's hard to say if Tolle has been a player in the first place - and like so needs all these funny stories for authority, credibility. He WANTS that spiritual authority conferred to him, it seems.  <br /> <br />In this context I would like to point out and recommend the book \\"Be here now\\" by Ram Dass, which has been published a long time ago, and \\"Journey of Awakening: A Meditator's Guidebook\\". Maybe read \\"I am that\\" by Nisargadatta Maharaj, or some by Ramana Maharshi plus \\"Siddhartha\\" by Hermann Hesse (a great narrative!) - All in all, I still recommmend this book, for its incredible clarity of writing, but I have less doubts about other authors.  <br />
B000002BE9|5.0|I've had the song \\"Criminal\\" running through my head for days now. Something about it perfectly captures the way you can feel sometimes -- like a crazy combination of rage and ennui in relationships. Anyway, the song was so constant in my head that I had to run out today and buy this CD. Listening to it and the rest of the songs has been somewhat cathartic. A great emotional experience through the music. What else can you ask for from a CD?
B000000H3Z|5.0|Whoa!  I had a hard time finding this CD.  I must have been looking for this thing for almost a year.  Worth every search for it though.  I had finally found it at some backwards store in Chicago.  This is the record that really put Sepultura on the spot.  Aggressive Thrash with Aggressive Attitude/lyrics just go together.  Whether it's Mass Hypnosis, Inner Self, Beneath the Remains or any of the other tracks; head banging can commence to every one of them.  At this time Max's voice was still a little \\"young\\" so to say, His growl isn't as good on this album as it is on Arise or Chaos A.D. for example.  But you can still tell it's him and it still keeps the album flowing.  The 3 bonus tracks are pretty cool too.  Track 10 has worse production and is a little strange. (Still cool) and the 2 drum tracks are very captivating.  I myself am a drummer so these are really cool.  You like thrash?  You like the Max Years with Sepultura? Then get this!  You can't have a true metal collection without this!
B000002AHC|5.0|Of the thousands of albums recorded by bands in the state of personal turmoil, \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" is one of the best. Indeed the album is notorious for the all of the conflicts that were surrounding the members of the group at the time, but when one listens to this suite of songs, it's hardly evident. In fact, The Byrds sound as if they were using all of their talents concentrating on easing their music forward into the next chapter. But though the music within suggested harmony, original member David Crosby was fired during the sessions, and drummer Michael Clarke (another member of the \\"classic\\" Byrds line-up) was replaced by session drummer Jim Gordon on some takes. Obviously, Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman assumed most of the responsibility. The mask of a group in musical and personal accord is further unveiled in this expanded edition of \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\"; after the last bonus track there's an unlisted radio ad for the album, but after that comes an excerpt from a rather tense session that starts out fair enough but turns into a heated argument as the result of a spat with Clarke, and the insults and four-letter words fly.<br /><br />But as with most albums recorded under such conditions, the result is not affected and \\"Byrd Brothers\\" is often called the group's best effort. Here, the group takes all of their talents and roots in folk rock, space rock, even country rock, and winds them into an enviable, flawless merging of three different musical elements, with musical, personal, and social statements interwoven throughout. The title and album artwork may remind one of the gritty Old West, but if you're expecting that you're in for a disappointment. The music is surprisingly advanced, and at the time was the Byrds' most ambitious album, an obvious reaction to the studio innovations of the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" released the previous year. With all of the Byrds' various tastes and influences scattered throughout the album like bottle caps across the highway, it also creates a musical atmosphere without a name, but is effective nonetheless. The statements range from the dark to the optimistic; Crosby's `Draft Morning' is a frank, blunt stab at the Vietnam situation, thematically in contrast to a well-performed cover of the innocent `Goin' Back' (which should have been a big hit for the Byrds) and another cover `Wasn't Born To Follow.' The former of these two contained gorgeous vocal harmonies that were reminiscent of the group's first two albums, this time minus songwriter Gene Clark (who had already left the band). `Change is Now' is a gorgeously textured song, one of the Byrds' best \\"addressing-a-generation\\" songs, featuring a searing guitar line. There are also songs that express a simple feeling of joy or jubilation, such as the dazzling `Get To You,' which certainly suggested that this was a group that was getting along even if that wasn't the case. However on some tracks, perhaps some of the tension within the band emerged in sudden bursts of rough, violent parts that interrupt otherwise pretty musical textures; this happens on tracks like `Draft Morning,' `Dolphin's Smile,' and `Tribal Gathering,' (the sudden dark guitar lines of which were supposedly meant to be a symbol of the presence of the Hell's Angels at a hippie event). `Artificial Energy' is probably the toughest song on \\"Byrd Brothers,\\" a direct cynical piece about the problems with amphetamines (a reaction to the incorrect accusations that some of the group's earlier songs had been tributes to drugs). Speaking of which, space rock plays an important role in much of the music, most obviously on the closing mini-epic `Space Odyssey.' Among the bonus tracks on this essential re-issue are two instrumentals, alternate takes of two tracks, an instrumental demo, and Crosby's lyrically disturbing `Triad,' an homage to threesomes, eerily prophetic in the singer's involvement decades later in the birth of the baby of lesbian couple Melissa Etheridge and Julie Cypher. The exclusion of the song on the album was one of the major rifts between Crosby and the rest of the group.<br /><br />Perhaps it's fitting that one of the most elaborate albums of the immediate post-\\"Sgt. Pepper\\" influence came from a group that was once called the \\"American Beatles,\\" and for a time rivaled the success of the British invasion, and some call \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" the group's own \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\" Indeed, the use of horns and the fact that many songs seamlessly lead into one another does suggest that the Beatles' album was an influence. The wild studio experimentation and discovery on \\"Byrd Brothers\\" opened up new doors that the Byrds would continue to explore even in their rapidly approaching full blown country-rock transition, a change that was so flawless and unspoiled that it proved to be something the Beatles would never accomplish.Etheridge and Julie Cypher.

B000268QB2|5.0|To those fellow reviewers who try to dismiss some of this brilliant album's high points as \\"cheesy\\" retreads of \\"80s style soaring choruses\\" I ask, \\"As if that's a bad thing???\\".  Sure, if the first time you heard \\"Take On Me\\" and \\"Alive and Kicking\\" you thought \\"Ugh, dismissive 80s style soaring chorus songs\\" and chucked them aside, well then, go put Sound Garden on your stereo and be happy. <br /> <br />But when I first heard this album I was instantly reminded of such groups as Alphaville, Camouflage, Ocean Blue, A-Ha (I can go on) and I was beside myself that somebody not only captured the pure joy of the fringe music of that era of music (compared to the Depeche Modes, REMs, Cure), but also updated it for the present.  I wanted to call all my in-the-know friends and demand they buy this album and share in the pleasure.  After 20 years of songs that sounded nothing like, this album brought it back. <br /> <br />Hearing this album the first time was like finding out that my high school girlfriend left a message saying \\"Made a mistake, want you back\\". <br /> <br />All the other positive reviews here nail this album perfectly so I won't belabor the points, but also check out \\"Sunshine\\", my favorite song from the album.  All in all, this album has catchy songs with a powerful untertow, and its a \\"singers\\" album that makes me want to take up karoake. <br /> <br />Gratuitous extra review: Check out Stellastarr while you're at it.
B00000IMYA|5.0|After listening to the 'first' release of this wonderful Jazz collection, I thought it was one of the best albums in my collection.  Then upon hearing Sony's version, I am pleased to say that this album has taken top spot.  The 'correct' production of Diminuendo in Blue and Crescendo in Blue is much more enjoyable to listen to.  The Duke can be heard more clearly in the background along with the others as Paul Gonsalves does his thing. <br />I am also pleased with the fast delivery from Amazon.  They estimated the delivery to take over a week, it took just three days.
B00005K3LW|3.0|Once again, Bruce Willis pulls out his white vest, makes sure its clean, only to get it dirty all over again. Some people have commented on the fact that Brucie baby is getting on a bit now, but he still looks fine in this movie - they'd be testing our patience if they did a fourth Die Hard.<br /><br />I've seen the first one (and reviewed it), but haven't seen the second one, due to the fact the first two were based on a very hectic Christmas Eve. And we're in the middle of summer, so instead, the second has been pencilled in for just before this Christmas please :) (Along with Reindeer Games) So I felt a bit out of sorts watching it without even seeing the second one. Although, the first sequel is normally quite bad (Scream 2, Terminator 2, etc). I was wondering what happened to Bonnie Bedelia, who wasn't in this, more's the pity, and the fact that this wasn't based on Christmas Eve was a shame. Although his wife gets mentioned a plenty, there's not much of a valid reason given as to why she features strongly in the first one, but why she's suddenly cast aside for the third. It does lead to many jokes about why can't Bruce can't keep his hands on a woman.<br /><br />Samuel L Jackson is once again credited as the bit part, the second in command to the terrific Bruce. He never seems to get much of the lead roles, and instead is second to someone much greater. But in this, they seem to befriend each other, even though they hated each other to begin with - such a cliche.<br /><br />This film involves a character's brother from a previous film, not to give the game away, but it's quite fun. They have to solve riddles, which would have been fun for some people, but most of them, especially the elephant & 4 gallons of water riddles went straight over my head! While everyone's running around, fearing bombs going off any second, it's obvious to the viewer that it's all a trick, and the bomb could go off in a completely different place.<br /><br />There's some spectacular action scenes, the most memorable one is the train sequence, which thoroughly beats Speed hands down. I think my jaw dropped during most of it.<br /><br />There are no memorable lines from this - the first Die Hard seemed so quotable, unless you have a brain similar to a sieve like moi, but there's not much memorable about this movie. Unless you like Bruce Willis. Then there's loads memorable! His white vest has become a bit of a trademark.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good movie, but I sometimes find there's a lot of action, and not much else inbetween. I think it's highly unlikely that there's going to be a fourth, if there is, I'll be highly disappointed. He should just grow old gracefully.acular action scenes, the most memorable one is the train sequence, which thoroughly beats Speed hands down.

B000002B7U|3.0|I had to write this review to disagree with many of the previous reviews. I for one do not really enjoy this album very much, basically because it has the typical 80s metal sound to it, which I do not like. There are much stronger Ozzy albums, especially Blizzard and Diary, both with Randy Rhoads. While there are some good tracks (especially the title track which is great), overall I don't give this album many listens. If you like the 80s sound you will likely enjoy this album and you can ignore this review, but otherwise I would not recommend it.
B000005H7D|5.0|This is mainly a response to the music fan that said this Trane album is bland and over hyped. I have every piece of music Trane recorded and this one is by far my favorite. Its the one I listen to the most. This was also John Coltrane's Favorite album he ever recorded as well and for good reason. Any one who thinks Moments Notice or Locomotion is boring may wanna have their pulse checked. Giant Steps and My Favorite Things are also highly recommended.
8470021818|5.0|Author Frank Herbert's masterpiece of science fiction, \\"Dune,\\" has earned the bragging rights to be known as one of the premier sci-fi classical writings of all time.<br /><br />If you can get past the commercialism spanning over decades of a board game or two, a movie, a television series, comic books, etc., and read the book objectively with no biases, you most likely will find an unbelievably rich and detailed story that harkens back to the likings of a Greek tragedy.<br /><br />The setting in \\"Dune\\" is far into the future where mankind has warred and has spread out into the universe.  Organized religion still plays a vital role (Orange Catholic Bible, etc.).  The nobility of each habitable planet bicker, plot, negotiate, and war with each other like Renaissance city-states.  The title planet, Arrakis or \\"Dune\\" is a desert planet of sand that is rich in the spice \\"Melange.\\"  Melange allows, when ingested as a narcotic, primarily among other things, the Space Guild to bend space so as to transport personnel and cargo great distances in little time.  The main plot involves two warring Noble Houses that compete for control of \\"Dune\\" for various reasons involving much deceit and treachery.  The protagonist of the story, Paul Atreides, finds himself a sort of \\"Hamlet\\" type of figure who grows physically, mentally, and spiritually to become a Messianic type of figure who controls the desert planet and terraforms it to become habitable (like Earth).  The story is so much more involved than this though! I believe, however, that the sci-fi reader will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I read this book in 1987 after having seen the Dino DeLaurentis movie of the same name a few years before.  Needless to say, I loved it!  This book is the benchmark of the sci-fi genre.  I rate this book at five stars.  A masterpiece!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|When I learned he passed away I was exceptionally sad. Ray Charles had scheduled a tour in New England last year but had to cancel it, so I missed a last opportunity to hear him live. But, with this CD he sends yet another message from, in effect, beyond the grave. And, what great music it is! Over the years as he matured, his sytle and voice may have changed, but his work is as special on this album as it was when he first burst on the scene. May God bless the man.
0553277472|5.0|This book is one of those things I should have gotten into long ago.  Much like laughing at that girl who asked me out to prom, having waited so long to read this book is something that now makes me scratch my head -- why didn't I pick this up sooner?<br /><br />I first heard of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance from Peter Egan's \\"Side Glances\\" column in Road and Track.  He mentions it now and then with approbation and a slightly conspiratorial tone, like he is talking to a very specific but special readership whenever he mentions the title.  This book is not about motorcycles (though it stars one) and it is not about Zen (though it does get mentioned).  It is basically a philosophy dissertation -- a Chautauqua, as the narrator puts it -- assisted by the story of a man and his son crossing the country by motorcycle.  Sometimes the narrated events provide concrete examples of the theoretical topics of the philosophical discussion, and sometimes the events are thinly veiled allegories for the journey through the narrator's thoughts.  But at all times this is an absorbing book that tackles such huge issues, with such analytical zest, that you wonder why more people have not read it.<br /><br />All superlative praise aside, this book is not for everyone.  If you find that you prefer dialogue to monologue, feelings to thoughts, and extroversion to introversion, I recommend that you read something else.  ZatAoMM is not for narrow attention spans.  It is dense reading, but for the right person, it is extremely rewarding.

B00000DHZJ|5.0|Fortunately I happened to find this CD at my favorite record store for a good deal a couple weeks ago.  I didn't grow up listening to Jimi Hendrix -- I was born seven years after he died -- but it's hard not to like this guy's music.  Wasn't he basically the creator of the guitar solo?  I mean, this guy's contributions to rock and roll are so seminal that to say you don't like him is basically to say you don't like rock music.<br /><br />All the songs I think of when I think of Jimi are on this CD: Purple Haze, Fire, Hey Joe, The Wind Cries Mary, The Star Spangled Banner, you name it, it's on here.  I am sure there are much more knowledgeable people who will have a bone to pick about the track listing, but for the average person who just likes Jimi's stuff and wants to get all of the well-known songs in one place, look no further.<br /><br />I bought this CD for the above tracks but now I have a new favorite: Castles Made of Sand.  I still don't totally know what this song is about, but the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  It is melancholy, relaxed, and funny all at the same time.<br /><br />Five stars for a CD I should have bought a long time ago.
1400031354|5.0|Many light years ago, as an English major, I took a class in African Literature as an elective...and I was, even young and callow as I was, immediately struck by the stark simplicity of the writing and the major life truths hidden behind this lyrical simplicity.<br /><br />So, too, are the novels of McCall Smith, whose enchanting stories of Precious Ramotswe, the no-nonsense head of the Women's Number One Detective Agency in Botswana, present deep life truths in the most disarmingly simple and charming way.<br /><br />In this sequel to \\"The Women's Number One Detective Agency,\\" Mma Ramotswe must decide many important things: Where she and her fiance, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, will live (whose house is better)? whether or not she should promote her stalwart secretary to Junior Detective, whether she should get a diamond engagement ring, and most of all, what happened to a young American college man missing for 10 years, whose distraught mother has come to beg Ramotswe's services.<br /><br />This book is no less than perfection. I am eagerly looking foward to the next!
B000003GMI|4.0|A phone call with a friend in England recently led to a suggestion that I listen to Porcupine Tree. My friend, knowing of my suupoty of the Pink Floyd, and who himself had been an avid fan, was bemoaning the long overdue appearance of a new Floyd album and hoping against hope that David Gilmore would reassemble the band in the aftermath of the settlement of Roger Waters' lawsuit.<br /><br />I managed to find this album at the local music store along with a number of later releases and from the moment the first chord struck, I thought Floyd.<br /><br />Now, dear reader, a long time ago in England's pleasant land, I had suspected that the Pink Floyd would follow a different path than the one they chose by recording Dark Side of the... I believed that the Tangerine Dream album Zeit should have been the course they charted but alas they did not and steered themselves into the megaband they once were.<br /><br />So, having heard this album a couple of times I still think Floyd whenever it is on. Not any old Floyd but UmmaGumma Floyd with dashes and Sprinkles of other, earlier albums predominantly although there are some animals in there too and wish you were here. In many respects it is reminiscent of the first Starsailor album being too Tim Buckley than Tim Buckley. They say that the best form of praise is to copy the originator so clearly there is a genuflection to the earlier band. And, as you listen closely there are Gilmore's hallmark devices, the saoring guitar and those recognisable ;ittle quirks. Praise indeed.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong. The music here is very listenable and strolls along in a very amiable and quixotic way. Ambient yet not, rock yet not. There is a very dreamlike quality about it and it really does sound very clear on a good sound system with separation much like Dire Straits Brothers In Arms. in comaprison to later works this is a more experimental album and yet it is a strong testament to early influences. It is a mood album with it's own dynamic and is clearly an early morning chill album much like some Indian ragas.<br /><br />I would compare thee to a fine wine. It is clear that the bottle comes from a strong branded family but it is obvious that it is a different vintage and comes from an off the beaten track chateau. It is music for the dawn as the night is slowly vanquished by the strengthening rays of the sun until the tired watcher falls into slumber.<br /><br />Certainly an album to savour, certainly music to miss Floyd by and certainly a point of departure for a band who clearly have much more to offer.<br /><br />Watch this space for more reviews of their other albums.t's own dynamic and is clearly an early morning chill album much like some Indian ragas. <br /> <br />I would compare thee to a fine wine.

B0002CTSVS|5.0|To say that this movie is a cinematic masterpiece is a gross understatement and quite simply fails to do it justice. Watching this movie is like walking into the Louvre and viewing an amazing piece of art. Every moment completely encapsulates you and stays with you, every pan of the camera, every heartbreaking injustice opens your eyes to what true strength is. Mr. Gibson created a breathtakingly beautiful film, we are lucky enough to  watch a moving piece of art unfold in front of our sometimes shocked, but always believing eyes. His casting was incredible, Jim Caviezel was absolutely stunning as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern's performance as the Virgin Mary was utterly tragic.<BR>As for the controversies that surrounded this film, you quite simply have to put all controversies aside the moment the film begins. Once you step foot into Mr. Gibson's profound experience of Jesus' Passion you can't help but feel changed.
B00005JMXX|4.0|When you go to see a disaster movie, you don't really go to have a deep and insightful storyline. You go to see things get wrecked in a vague read-about-this-in-a-science-book sort of plausible storyline where things basically just get trashed...And this does it. On a HUGE scale. <br /> <br />Dennis Quaid's made some good movies over the years. Nothing that boggle the mind, but they're pleasant to watch. This, though, was much better than any of that. This was just delightful. <br /> <br />My only complaint were those CGI wolves. Seriously. That was really dorky. I mean come on, you're either falling into the \\"Twister\\" camp of movies or the \\"Resident Evil\\" camp...but don't go for both. They really served no purpose, the CGI work on them was poor and I really thought that it only served to divert from the rest of the storyline. <br /> <br />Most noteworthy of the movie, and I reason I shall not forget it anytime soon was Ian Holmes. He is one of the finest actors in the world, one of the greatest talents we have, and it's in full-bloom here. He plays a quiet scientist, but even with his reserved manner and precise speech you grow to love him through the short while he's on screen. His final words made me grin fondly. Perfect job, Mister Holmes. <br /> <br />All in all, it was a terrific summer flick. A lot of fun, and it made good conversation with my family over dinner later that night. That's gotta count for something. :)
B00005JNEI|2.0|I watched this film hoping that unknown facts would be revealed about both the war in Iraq and the events surrounding the attacks of 9/11. What I found instead was a humorous propaganda film. I was disappointed by the way Moore takes advantage of misconceptions and \\"creatively\\" edits certain parts of the film to reflect his personal political ideologies. Among other things, his claims that the Bush administration sheltered and flew the BinLaden family out of the country after the attacks of 9/11 were proven to be false by the 9/11 Commission. No matter what your political views may be, a half-truth is equivilent to a lie no matter who tells it. It is a well-done movie, but be objective when you view it.
0805076476|5.0|This is a great book.  Don't listen to any of the bad reviews.  They talk of \\"jock-fascism\\" among other things.  However, they missed the point.  They must have been expecting something else, I don't know what though. <br /> <br />THE BOOK ISN'T ABOUT FIGHTING.  The book is about how \\"Jack\\" needs to fix his life.  He sees where it is heading and he hates it and needs to find a way to change it, so he meets Tyler. <br /> <br />One of my favorite things about the book is the writing style.  Some people say it is terrible, but to me it is like a good abstract painting.  It might look like the artist randomly threw paint everywhere but the end product is something really special.  If reading pointless drivel \\"classics\\" makes you feel high and mighty, this book might not be for you.  The writing style is direct and in-your-face which works well for this book. <br /> <br />*About the review that said this book was latent homoeroticism...it mentions Tyler messes around with logs and that is what you think?  I think someone has some latent issues themself...
B00007ELEL|5.0|i've owned this movie a total of four times now, twice on VHS, and this makes it the second on DVD. I just can't seem to keep track of who borrows this one - it's always being borrowed by one friend or another!  <br />Without a doubt, my personal favorite cult classic comedy. (don't know if it's reached \\"cult classic\\" status yet or no, but i'm going to go ahead and assume it has - what makes a cult classic anyway?)  <br />This film will keep your interest for the long haul, also with considerable replay value - there are always little jokes and surprises that you may have missed the first viewing or two - quite a bit of almost Monty Python-esque satire and dry humor to keep you laughing for hours. <br />Jeff Bridges plays the best slacker i've ever seen on film - long hair, bathrobe and slippers at all times, and a drink in his hand about 90 percent of the time as well!  <br />John Goodman is about as intense and intimidating a figure as he could be while still portraying a character in a comedy, I beleive Goodman truly stole the show in this one. Buscemi is good as well, even with his small role.  <br />Julianne Moore is strange, yet intriguing, and adds a form of love interest to the plot (well... kind of) <br />But in the end it is a very well rounded, attention grabbing, deep plotted masterpiece of a comedy which will completely satisfy those who feel that a funny movie does ot necessarily have to be a stupid one - just a little twisted... <br />
B000002AGB|5.0|I love the Who live at London England at the festival The Isle Of Wight-1970. This is number 2 compared to LIVE AT LEEDS the best who album. The new WHO DVD does not include the full performence as this CD does. The music is great on this CD full of blues, and heavy rock n roll. Dont get fooled again! This is the best release of the isle of wight without a doubt. I love the song Young Man Blues, also I love the jam on Water. You want only the best? I prefer THE WHO Live At The Isle Of Wight. Other than the music their is a great booklet including many rare photographs very cool. Rock On!
B000068FY0|5.0|Many people prefer BREAKFAST IN AMERICA (and it's very good), but I think CRIME OF THE CENTURY is a Supertramp's best album because the overindulgence of the first two (out of print) albums has been reined in while adding a thick coat of grit reminiscent of such bands as  Grand Funk Railroad and Montrose, something that would be missing on BREAKFAST. Rick Davies' gritty, bluesy singing is juxtaposed with Roger Hodgson's boyish tenor the way Felix Pappalardi's and Leslie West's singing co-existed in Mountain, especially on \\"Dreamer\\", where both men take lead vocals. The song \\"Bloody Well Right\\" scathingly mocks such issues as legacy preference at leading universities, while the opener, \\"School\\", could be about pressure to conform to anything, even, especially, a popular musical trend. There are also songs here that warn of the consequences of making dangerous/unhealthy choices for oneself; however, underneath all of the bleakness is a message that we can rise above our own foolishness and begin again by accepting responsibility for our own failed, dysfunctional behaviors. This moral, which runs through the entire CD, inspired me to print up a whole bunch of actress photos in my lifetime. Simply put, these guys rock as hard in some places as any Grand Funk Railroad or Montrose album, and with a lot more true intensity than any Pearl Jam album. People who side against anyone who likes this band are not fooling anyone but themselves.
B00006YXE4|5.0|I love this double set including the peformence of One More Car: One More Rider on both (CD and DVD) for a great price. Just to let all of you know if you would buy the CD, and DVD seperate you will spend more money if you buy this CD, and DVD set together you will save alot of money. Clapton hails his guitar on this one. A really cool song is Reptile, Change The World, and My Father's Eye on DISC ONE. On the second CD I really like Hoochie Coochie Man, also Layla. The DVD is better because you get to experience the performence close up. The DVD is more enjoyable than the CD. If you want the latest from the best Clapton you better prefer this one. Enjoy!
B00008H2LB|5.0|One day at school I overheard these two guys talking about the new LP album to be relwased in about a month.I am like a major LP fan:i have t-shirts,DVDs, Posters, CDs all ove my room and most of my possesions.Anyway i walk up to the guys and say something like \\"hey guys what u talking about\\" and one of them replies \\"oh nothing U probably don't know who they are\\" and walks off.Anyway these guys thought they were like major fans,turns out i have more merch than both put together and doubled.The guys who talked to me was probably pretty hacked off when i opened my desk with LP,Linkin Park scribblede and carved all over it. <br />Anyway great album must have(must play loud to). <br />Also look for AdEMA,The Offspring,Blink182,Taproot and soulfly if u like LP(LP=Linkin Park). <br />
B0000C9ZSV|4.0|Jimi Hendrix: Live At Berkeley is indeed a wonderful live album out of the bunch. The greatest part about his american 1970 tour was he played alot of newer songs including Hey Baby. Hendrix also played the older songs like Hey Joe, and Purple Haze. This is one of Hendrix's greatest performence im sure their are many more LIVE recordings in the vaults that are better, but Berkeley still lives the power, and intensity of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The only problem is this concert is only the second set, Experience Hendrix did not include the first set only the second. Other than that I recomened this Live At Berkeley to you always!
B00003CWOL|4.0|By the time this movie came out, most people had at least heard of Kevin Smith.  He was rattling the independent circuit and he had some decent credentials under his belt (a very successful indy film and a bomb of a high budget film) and he was finally given the chance to create a big budget film of one of his first scripts.  That script was a story of how two banned angels from the bible tried to get back into heaven and all the chaos that ensued.  Although it was HIGHLY controversial, I believe Smith creates a pretty good story without attacking any one religion and keeping the holes in his plot to a minimum. <br /> <br />Loki and Bartleby are two angels that have been banned from heaven by God and stuck in the second worse place in America, Milwaukee, WI.  Fortunately for them, Cardinal Glick as part of a \\"Catholicism Wow!\\" campeign in McHenry, IL, has decided to make a few changes in the church.  Along with his \\"buddy Christ\\" he's offered to forgive anyone for their sins and assure safe passage into heaven if they are blessed under the church's arch.  As the two angels make their way to IL, people on both sides of the yin-yang (good and evil) are frantically trying to stop them to prevent the world from ending (which is what happens when you defy God's decree).  Who will win?  Will God be able to defend his decree?  Will the Devil stop the angels?  Or will they pass through the arch and destroy all of history? <br /> <br />The plot is hard to explain, but Smith unravels it in quite a simple and definitely smooth style that it's quite simple for audiences of all ages to comprehend.  The acting is top notch, but Smith borrowed from some of Hollywood's most popular to help him with that.  Affleck and Damon give a great duo performance as the heretic angels trying to demolish all of humanity.  Alan Rickman gives a great performance, especially when he gets to couple up with Chris Rock.  Other noteable names are Linda Fiorrentino playing the lead, George Carlin as Cardinal Glick, Selma Hyak as the muse, and Jason Lee as Azrael.  I am not a religious person, but my mother sure is and I challanged her to watch this film with me and find religious contradictions.  Surprisingly not only could she not find any notable ones, she also found the movie to be quite entertaining (although she HATED the crude humor)!   <br /> <br />The version of the DVD that I have really doesn't have much to offer in the ways of special features, I have the traditional copy that came out first.  It does give you the clean widescreen version with 5.1 surround sound, but I would tell anyone who buys this film to get the Special Edition which I'm told is LOADED with special features.  Definitely a great four film for Smith.

There is really nothing original about \\"Mystic River\\", or even an original twist. <br /> <br />THE PLOT <br /> <br />Jimmy,Dave,Sean. Friends who grew up in a working - class Boston. They drift apart after a terrible tragedy. Years later, brutal events reconnect them. <br /> <br />This is a great film, I wish I could of given it five stars, but it's not original, but this film has great acting.  Tim Robbin and Sean Penn deserved their Oscar's.
B000002JSR|4.0|If you're looking at this review, chances are you know the story behind this CD from other reviews.  But, if you haven't, here's a quick overview - In late 1980, Led Zeppelin's legendary drummer John Bonham suffered a tragic and much too early death.  And while the band immediately disbanded, unable to continue without Bonham, they still had some unreleased songs in the can. Enter \\"Coda\\", released in 1982.          Right off the bat, \\"Coda\\" is impressive.  The CD starts off with \\"We're Gonna Groove\\", recorded live from their historic Royal Albert Hall show January 9, 1970.  This version can be heard - as well as seen - on Led Zeppelin's \\"DVD\\".  Next, is one of my favorite tracks on the CD, \\"Poor Tom\\".  If you like the acoustic numbers on \\"III\\", you will love \\"Poor Tom\\".  The third track on the album, \\"I Cant Quit You Baby\\", also comes from the Royal Albert Hall performance.          Three of the remaining five songs are from the \\"In Through the Out Door\\" sessions, but are a bit harder than most songs on Zep's final studio album.  \\"Darlene\\", \\"Ozone Baby\\",and \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" are all good songs, with \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" being the standout of the album.  It was Zeppelin's answer to the emerging punk scene of the late 70's.          Thrown in the middle of the ITTOD outtakes is \\"Walter's Walk\\" and \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\", which was toyed with in live versions of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" in 1972 and possibly recorded in the \\"Houses of the Holy\\" sessions, with some vocal and guitar reworkings prior to the \\"Coda\\" release. \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\" is a drum solo that Bonham recorded in 1976 with Jimmy Page in Montreux, Switzerland during the hiatus forced by Robert Plant's auto accident.  The song is more than just a drum solo, its a a testament to his enormous talent.        \\"Coda\\" is a very underrated collection of music, but one must realize its not an \\"album\\"; it's a collection of outtakes.  Therefore, I wouldn't suggest this as one's first Zep album.  But if you are triedand true Zeppelin fan, this is a must have.

B00003CXA2|5.0|Winner of numerous Oscars(including best director-Robert Zemeckis,best actor-Tom Hanks,and best picture),Forrest Gump is one of the greatest movies ever made.Tom Hanks(in his most well-known role)plays Forrest Gump,a man who has limited intelligence,but has a heart of gold.While watching this film,you will be amazing by the amazing performances,the brillant plot,and the character of Forrest Gump himself,who overcomes his disabilites and becomes a man who will never forget.Overall,I recommend this movie!!!!!It truly is Tom Hanks'best performance(this and Philadelphia,of course).
B00006G8HX|5.0|Now this is what I mean about character development, not just mindless action like \\"The Matrix Trilogy\\"(I mean \\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\"). This is the darkest \\"Star Trek\\" film, EVER. And if anyone is a huge geek, a nerd, and a fan of Spock, THAN YOU'LL LOVE THIS FILM. Watching these old classics gives me hope that oneday there will be a great \\"Star Trek\\" film again, someday. But for now I'll just watch the classics.
B00027JYLC|3.0|This movie is about people with real physical deformities playing sideshow freaks-one of whom is mistreated and how the other freaks join together to exact revenge. Plot is simplistic, but the movie is interesting in showing the adaptability of people with physical limitations.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Will Farrel is the Jim Carrey of our time, first \\"Old School\\" and the \\"Elf\\", he's box office, and he's hilarious, what MORE DO PEOPLE NEED. And the supporting cast is incredible, and there are images in this film that will never leave my mind. like Will Farrel running naked in the streets. Well I had to give this film five stars, cause its stupid and funny.
0385510438|2.0|John Grisham may well be the very best author working in the U.S. today.  Let's just get that out of the way up front, since everyone seems to repeat it ad nasuem.  He's one of the greats- and, unlike many lesser authors, his creativity has not dried up over all these years. <br /> <br />But having dabbled in fictional writing myself, I came up with roughly the same storyline as this book.  While I didn't complete a manuscript, I did manage to get a few chapters (as well as a complete outline... hmmmmm...) to several publishers.  Oh, and before I forget to specify, this was all more than 3 years ago. <br /> <br />So it goes without saying that I was loathe to finish reading this book, and my opinion remains somewhat biased.  Of course I love the story- but I loved it more when I was telling it!  Please keep in mind, I'm not making any accusations.
B00004WG2F|1.0|The Cinematography is amazing, the story is wholesome, but the acting is hideous. <br /> <br />THE PLOT <br /> <br />The plot is a passionate journey into the darkest secrets of love, betrayal and the unbreakable bonds of brotherhood. <br /> <br />*****SPOILERS AHEAD***** <br /> <br />When I bought this movie I knew I had a jewel in my closet. 48 hours later I realized I'd wasted both my money and my precious two hours on this melodramatic mess of a movie.  <br /> <br />I'd wasted my time watching a movie where Everyone dies, where there is annoying narration throughout the film, and where Anthony Hopkins looked indescribably horrid. And that's only the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt was too beautiful early in his career so people doubted his acting ability. Now Brad is forty years old, his face has more character, and no one doubts his acting ability. Maybe its old age or he's getting some acting lessons, whatever it is, it works. <br /> <br />The Cinematography is amazing and reminded me of \\"Lawrence Of Arabia.' The incomparable artistry and vision of David Lean is present in Edward Zwick's directing. The Academy Awards made a great choice giving `Legends of The Fall' an Oscar for Best Cinematography. <br /> <br />In the end though I couldn't believe that Edward Zwick directed this film. <br /> <br />He directed \\"Glory\\", the Great War epic that earned Denzel Washington an Academy Award. I didn't want to see \\"Glory\\" because the same director of `Legends Of The Fall' directed it, but when I saw \\"Glory\\" on cable I realized I'd made a huge mistake. I had unknowingly bought Zwick's worst movie when I purchased `Legends Of The Fall.' <br /> <br />Trying not to see my psychiatrist, I wondered whether Zwick had gone Hollywood or was cursed with a horrible screenwriter.  <br /> <br />Please don't make the same mistake.
B00005AR3G|5.0|I really liked this movie because it has some great music in it. I'm not sure that most kids really would get this movie. My Sons favorite part is the monkey that eats the lady bug.
B000286RKW|5.0|This is the best mob film ever. Scorsese's directing is on top just as are Deniro's and Liotta's performances. Joe Pesci plays the perfect psycopath and Deniro as usual gives a great performance as he does in every other Scorsese film. New generation, old tradition, that's exactly what this movie is all about. In the old tradition a wise guy would never kill a made guy, in the new tradition, a wise guy does kill a made guy but he can't get away with it. <br /> <br />Does the Godfather deserve to be in the same category as Goodfellas? \\"I say Yes.\\" There are three reason's why I think this is true. 1. The directing in both movies captures the reality of mob life and how their lives end. 2. The acting in both movies is superlative 3. The two movies depict the same subject but with different stories.  <br /> <br />I have to admit I think Goodfellas is much better than Godfather because the murder scenes in The Godfather are too stylish and too made up. Goodfellas on the other hand is based on a true story and the violent scenes look real and you get that feel of reality in those scenes because it really did happen. I'm not about to say Martin Scorsese is a better director than Coppola, but I feel that Scorsese's film Goodfellas has more emotion than Coppola's film Godfather. Remember that scene in Goodfellas when Deniro, Liotta, and Pesci are beating the life out of that made guy in the bar and you hear the music getting louder? That's what Scorsese does with his films. He uses music to enhance emotion in his movie's. Coppola does not do that, no music, no feeling, just a scene and a person.  <br /> <br />Some people may not like the ending of Goodfellas. To tell you the truth, I didn't like the ending at first, but I saw it five more times and I like it now. I know the ending doesn't give us a reason not to be a gangster, but Scorsese didn't want this film to have a sad ending like Blow. He wanted to make this film funny and crazy because that's the way Nicholas Pileggi's mob life was, funny and crazy. Scorsese did this film his way, the Martin Scorsese way.  <br />
B00028HBL6|5.0|This movie changes all of your priorities, it's amazing.  I sat through it 3 times, and each time, I felt even more and more involved, compelled, tortured, but yet much more aware of what Jesus suffered through, for all of us.  He died for our sins, yours, and mine.  It tears at your heart, and your emotions, and after reading several different reviews, by believers and non-believers, I can truly say you have to see it yourself, and form your own opinion.  It's the best movie I have ever seen, and the most moving.  See it, let Jesus into your heart, and then, get on with your life, but, put Jesus first.  Your entire life will change for the better.
B0001O3YD0|3.0|Riddick(Vin Diesel), is a very original character, he's a enigmatic piece of work. He talks trash, he's an anti hero, and a monster that reminds me of the boogie man. This film has no plot or even character developement, there's nothing to this film. It's also very boring, but if you want to see the first installment of \\"The Chronicles Of Riddick\\", and if your a Vin Diesel fan, than this is the film for you.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Yeah, yeah, I know, you've read it before on here, but I'm gonna say it again anyway: Do Not But This Album Unless You Really Don't Like Nirvana But Want To Sound Cool Or Are Too Pop-ized To Give A Crap About Good Music. Ok, now I've said it. Nirvana is my favorite band. I absolutely adore their music. But this is just wrong, to get their most popular songs, when, really the managers have left off the BEST songs: Negative Creep, Blew, About A Girl, Swap Meet, Downer, Teritorial Pissings, Breed, Lounge Act, Stay Away, On A Plain, Dive, Polly, Hairspray Queen, Aero Zeppelin, Big Long Now, Aneurysm, Serve The Servants, Frances Farmer..., Very Ape, Radio Friendly..., and that's just the begining! Please DO NOT buy this unless you are forced to at gunpoint, and, above all, DO NOT buy 'Journals'!!!! It's just wrong! How would YOU like all your personally thoughts and innermost secrets read by critical, idiotic, screwed-up, ignorant, snot-nosed little fakers?? Instead, show a little dignity and get Bleach, Nevermind, Incesticide, In Utero (the REAL version, not the 'clean' edit!), MTV Unplugged, and then try Heavier Than Heaven by Charles Cross if you want to read about Kurt, and finally go to justiceforkurt.com Thank you for reading this. Peace.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|Come back Vin Diesel. Diesel turned down this film because he wanted more money, bad mistake. \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" made almost as much money as the first one in the box-office. This film was entertaining, the girls were hot, but I left the theater, wanting more.
B00000FCBC|4.0|First off, this album isn't your average metallica album. Its a bunch of cover songs done by metallica (they didnt write them). Now it wasn't that aspect that prevented me from giving it another star, but the aspect that some of the songs werent covered as well as i wanted to hear. But still this is an overall good album. <br /> <br />Ratings: <br />Disc 1 <br /> <br />Free speech for the Dumb - 5/10 <br />Its electric - 8/10 <br />Sabbra Cadabra - 10/10 <br />Turn the page - 10/10 <br />Die, Die my Darling - 9/10 <br />Loverman - 10/10 <br />Mercyful Fate - 10/10 <br />Astronomy - 10/10 <br />Whiskey in the Jar - 9/10 <br />Tuesday's gone - 10/10 <br />The more I see - 7/10 <br /> <br />Disc 2 <br /> <br />Helpless - 10/10 <br />The Small Hours - 10/10 <br />The Wait - 10/10 <br />Crash Course In Brain Surgery - 8/10 <br />Last Caress/Green Hell - 7/10 <br />Am I Evil - 10/10 <br />Blitzkrieg - 10/10 <br />BreadFan- 10/10 <br />The Prince - 8/10 <br />Stone Cold Crazy - 10/10 <br />So What - 10/10 (Gotta love the lyrics \\"So F*cking What!\\") <br />Killing Time - 7/10 <br />Overkill - 9/10 <br />Damage Case - 8/10 <br />Stone Dead Forever - 9/10 <br />Too Late Too Late - 10/10 <br /> <br />Buy it, its pretty durn good. Only skipped 1 song on the album.
B00004RJ74|5.0|This is an action extravaganza. This a rare action that's meant to have no plot and not a lot of acting, but just enough acting to keep you interested. <br /> <br />THE PLOT <br /> <br />Two dangerous outlaws on a wild crime spree, they kidnap a father and his two kids. They head south to Mexico, but when their forced to face vampire, they have to team up to survive. <br /> <br />This is one of George Clooney's best performances. And this film is a Quentin Tarantino classic.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I agree with most other fans that this is a very good album, both musically and lyrically. But since not all of the songs on the albums come up to par, it doesnt quite get a 5 star rating. <br /> <br />Song Ratings: <br />As I Am - 8/10 <br />This Dying Soul - 9/10 <br />Endless Sacrifice - 10/10 <br />Honor thy Father - 8/10 <br />Vacant - 10/10 <br />Stream Of Consciousness - 10/10 <br />In the name of God - 10/10 <br /> <br />I still recommend you buy this album, its nearly perfect.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|The performances are incredibly, and the story touches you in a way that is perfect. But I do think that the best actor was Jude Law. Law does his whole performance with his eye's, not with his voice. Nicole Kidman was annoying, and Richard Roeper quotes: Renee Zellweger was screaming for the Oscar. So Jude Law was the best actor, but if it was up to me, I would say that the film was better than the performances. But if you want to escape from the 21st century, than watch \\"Cold Mountain.\\"
B00029LNHS|1.0|I used to like this CD, I admit it. But after I heard the disgusting \\"Let's Get Retarted\\", I stopped liking this CD because of a rhyme \\"bop your head like epilepsy\\", not to mention how often they use the word \\"retarted\\" as an insult. That is fully disgusting anyone can do that. And now that I think about it, they say many other politically incorrect things. Even though I like some artists that say more swearwords than the Black Eyed Peas, the Black Eyed Peas lyrics are much more rude technically, and this is just going way overboard. Don't waste your money on a CD like this.
B0000683DH|4.0|\\"Star Trek 2: The Wrath Of Khan\\" explores the demension of these characters and takes the \\"Star Trek\\" saga to a different level. What happened to the \\"Star Trek\\" saga, well Nicholas Meyer directed only a few of the \\"Star Trek\\" films, and maybe thats why some of these film are horrible. I hate \\"Star Trek\\" now, they replaced Admiral James t. Kirk(yes I said his full name) with Patrick Stewart, who plays a different captain, what were these guy's thinking(I think it maybe Patrick Stewart, I haven't kept up). \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\" quotes the most famous line of them all,\\"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\\" I love that line, it should be in the hall of fame of famous lines, like that line in \\"Titanic\\" \\"I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD.\\" <br /> <br />THE PLOT <br /> <br />It is the 23rd century. The Federation Starship U.S.S. Enterprise is on a routine training and Admiral James Kirk(William Shatner) seems resigned to the fact that this may well be his last mission of his career. But Khan is back. <br /> <br />This is a very good film, but it doesn't even compare to \\"The Search for Spock\\", that is my favorite \\"Star Trek\\" film.
1892005034|5.0|I have read this book over and over and always find a new layer to discover, like uncovering the multiple layers of needs when offering empathy. Dr. Rosenberg is a master story teller able to reinforce his teachings with experience, humor and seriousness.     A suggestion, read this book, practice offering empathy on real people and yourself, express yourself with honesty and then reread it again for the next layer of learning. A language as Dr. Rosenberg has developed, is challenging to learn or relearn, yet it has been so worth the effort helping me to connect deeply with others and especially myself.

B0002I831S|5.0|I'm 37 years old, and I favor the original Star Trek over the other series by leaps and bounds.  I work with a guy who is 56 yrs old, and saw the show as first-runs.  We regularly try to out-do each other with our knowledge of the original series.  He claims that, in the original series, at least one episode revealed the \\"T\\" in \\"James T. Kirk\\" to be \\"Tiberias\\".  I claim that none of the original 79 episodes reveal what the \\"T\\" represented, only that it was his middle initial.  He can't name the episode in which it occurred, but swears it happened.  Are there any \\"Original Star Trek\\" fans who can identify one of the 79 episodes in which the \\"T\\" was revealed to be \\"Tiberias\\"?  Thanks! <br /> <br />Dan
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I didn't see this film at Christmas because the previews and trailers all looked sappy and Christmas-y.  However, someone whose opinion I trust recommended the movie on DVD.  So I watched.  And is it sappy?  Yes.  But warm and fuzzy and really funny.  Recall \\"13 Conversations About One Thing\\" (also recommended), but lighter and with British accents.  A good \\"movie night\\" movie - a crowd pleaser.  You won't love it, but you won't hate it.  And you might watch it again when you're all alone and want to cry over the really sappy parts - when you know better.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|First of all, a quick note for Mr. \\"drtree\\".  Mr. \\"drtree\\" criticizes the lack of a commentary from the Wachowski Brothers themselves. Well, if Mr. \\"drtree\\" would have done some research on this release and what the Wachowski brothers have said on the this very issue.  The Wachowski Brothers have specifically stated that they opted out of doing commentaries BECAUSE they did not want their feelings/opinions on the movies to become \\"official dogma\\" concerning them.  Instead, they have done something brilliant, in my opion.  They have recorded two commentaries for each film, one by a set of scholars on the genre, and another by a set of critics.  So, in essence, you get a \\"fair and balanced\\" look at these films.<br /><br />Now then, with that said, let's look at the set itself.  The \\"Ultimate Matrix Collection\\" will be a 10-disc set that will contain a multitude of special features including all new \\"Revisited\\" discs for the sequal movies as well as three separate discs that discuss the trilogy as a whole.  And a plus for those who never purchased the Animatrix disc, as I didn't, it'll be included as well, because even though it's not a true part of the trilogy, it's a important part of the story, especially the CGI animated short, \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\".<br /><br />With the shear number of featurettes that this set will include (17 on Matrix Revisited, 21 on Matrix Reloaded Revisited including footage from the \\"Enter the Matrix\\" video game, 28 on Matrix Revolutions, 21 on the Burly Man Chronicles, and several full length documentaries) this will surely be the ULTIMATE MATRIX EXPERIENCE.
B000092ZYX|1.0|Look - it's okay to hate Radiohead.  Your cocktail party friends may alienate you, or call you a plebian or just plain stupid, but who needs cocktail party friends anyway?  So, say it with me \\"it's okay to hate Radiohead\\".  Because they are not good (with the single exception of The Bends, most of it anyway). <br /> <br />Did they go to Everything But the Girl's garage sale and purchase all of their old mini moog equipment?  There are a hundred better bands doing what Radiohead is trying to do here.  It's not edgy - it's crappy.  And it's okay to not like them.  <br /> <br />This album was given to me by the same person who tried to convince me that Okay Computer was indeed okay (And it's not.  Not okay, computer!  Stop doing that!  Control + Alt+ Delete = no more Radiohead.)  This album is incoherent, and well, crappy.  If more people start saying this out loud, to themselves and to others, a revolution can be started.  And maybe Radiohead will stop making albums.  Say it in the mirror a few times before trying it out on your friends and family - it gets easier with time and practice.  And for chrissakes - don't buy this album!  Even if the hipsters and the college radio stations tell you to!
0393035158|2.0|Harris regurgitates the smartalacky idea that the world would be a finer place if everyone would just stop being so stupid. He has had the freshman's epiphany: I got it!  Let smart people run the world! <br /> <br />Like any nineteen-year-old's semester project, a few comments should be written in red ink across the cover page. <br />   <br />First, his premises undermine his argument.  Harris posits 1) reason is within our grasp; 2) humankind is in fact reasonable; 3) we will act on what is reasonable; 4) we will act in unison; and 4) WE NEVER HAVE BEFORE.  Simply put, Harris is stuck with the Philosophy 101 answer to his epiphany: that the diagnosis (we are sick with un-reason) precludes the cure (a strong dose of reason).   <br /> <br />Second, he hasn't researched religion.  Harris is the smart kid in class who assumes religion is for dumb people; this is in fact his starting point, his 'first principle'.  And so he dismisses with an eye roll thousands of years of study and thought that much wiser people than he have taken quite seriously. <br /> <br />Third, while attributing a great deal of violence and darkness to religion, he utterly ignores the good.  A quick review of polling data and government statistical data would have shown Harris the correlation between religiosity and charity.  An historical review would have indicated the direct causal relationship between religion and the anti-slavery movement, religion and the suffrage movement, religion and the equal rights movement, and religion and nearly all anti-war movements around the world.  And last, had Harris spent any time at all reviewing current and past psychological theories he could not have ignored the fundamental connection between religiosity and good mental health.   <br /> <br />In fact, an honest review of these materials - statistical, historical, and psychological - would actually have indicated a disturbing connection between Harris' utopia-of-reason and the slavery, domination, discrimination, poverty, and war he detests.      <br /> <br />It is in this area that Harris most grandly fails.  He seems ignorant of so much that one must assume it is intentional misdirection.  He flatly ignores that his utopia of reason has been tried many, many times; and has invariably led to totalitarianism and atrocity.  Whether it is reason that leads to evil, or reason that attracts evil doers, we don't know.  But the correlation is undeniable throughout history.   <br /> <br />I imagine Harris remains perplexed by generations of otherwise educated folks who take religion seriously.  No doubt he strikes it up to brainwashing or some silly stage-theory of sociological development (of course cavemen needed religion --- but we have science!).  He should spend the next ten years actually reading these folks before he attempts this argument again.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie is nowhere near as good as all the hype that surrounded it. The story is weak, and the chemistry between Murray and Johansson was a dry, boring snooze fest. What am I missing here? The plot is something my four year old niece could of created. A girl, whose boyfriend ignores her while in Japan, falls (sort of) for an older guy (not likely, unless of course it is the real \\"Bill Murray\\" and not his character). They be-friend each other and go around to different parties and places hanging out just to keep each other company. The visuals are pretty good and I liked watching all the beautiful sights and hearing the sounds of Japan street life, but it was not enough to carry the whole movie. I found it rather boring, and was surprised considering I like realistic movies that do not rely on special effects and cheesy one liners. Unfortunately this movie failed to peak any real interest out of me. Rent it and decide for yourself.
B00005221M|5.0|This film was unfairly received and even worst appreciated in its real dimension .<br /><br />The movie runs before our eyes as the timeless memory of these brave ancestors , the courage and the fight man to man was a cruel reality . Inspired adaptation of the James Ferrimore Cooper novel the plot is about the ideological and political conflicts when the French Army has some allies forces against the English Corp at the west of Hudson river in the late years of the XVIII century .<br /><br />Visually stunning this film had an interesting cast with the charismatic magnetism of this superb actor Daniel Day Lewis and the ravishing acting of Wes Studi as Magua. The film combines poetic images showing all the nature fierce and wildness as a huge background where the drama will develop .<br /><br />The heroic insights will talk by themselves in this fundamental issue of 1992 .<br /><br />One of my twenty favorite american films in the nineties .
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is a good song writer because he talks about is past and his fans can relate to what he is saying in his songs. Most people struggle and go though some harsh times in there lives and its good that they can relate to him. I think this cd is very good and it helps some people out in there lives. Eminem is a great artist and i think he will come out with lot of great things in his career.
B00008DDSC|2.0|This script promised from its first shots . The first detail it came to my mind was the use of the color so typical of Pedro Almodovar in the eighties (Woman on the vergue of a nervous breakdown) .<br /><br />But it came the unexpected . This movie pretends to be a funny story but without a clear sense of disturbance and mistery . The characters are not depicted deeply . They are like human puppets both of them are shy but loosers too each one in their emotional circle . Both of them are isolated persons and they like the cat and mouse game . But the movie turns around a set of vignettes of ancient archetypes previously told in a most effective way .<br /><br />I may suggest three remarkable films : Sumision , Belle de jour and Night porter where there is substance beyond the distorted behavior .<br /><br />The film is extremely flat and nothing is left to the imagination . So you kill the erotism .<br /><br />And finally the film makes its last round and tries to become in a very special love story .<br /><br />The film runs at half road between the comedy and the tragedy to finnish not being neither one nor another .<br /><br />Good entertainment for teenagers !
B00005JMXX|3.0|THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is exactly the type of movie I expected it to be. There weren't any major surprises, the acting was decent, and the special effects were big. I was kind of disappointed there weren't a few more natural disasters added into the mix, but other than that things were good.<br /><br />The story revolves around climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who after years of research comes up with a theory about global warming and a possible coming ice age that most other scientists blow off as being too extreme. However, not long after, Jack's theory seems to be coming true as tornadoes rip through L.A. and softball size hail rains down in Tokyo, Japan. Reports come in that the temperatures of the world's oceans are decreasing at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, Jack's son Sam is off to a scholastic competition in New York. A day or so later, New York gets hit with a tidal wave and then it starts to snow. Jack realizes that New York will soon be at the center of a major deep freeze and he sets forth to rescue his son.<br /><br />The movie play out the way you expect it to play out and other than a few plot holes, is rather enjoyable. As a sidenote, the theory about global warming in the movie seems far-fetched. However, I found it rather fascinating. The film portrays a possible way that tropical climates could become areas of frozen ice and snow in a matter of minutes. In general, modern scientists don't believe it's possible for nature (science) to act so rapidly--after all evolution takes time. That's why the theory in the movie has been thrown off by \\"real\\" scientists as having little validity and an impossibility. But what seems most unlikely is sometimes the thing that is most plausible--is there a better explanation about frozen woolly mammoths found in arctic areas containing tropical vegetation in their stomachs?

0790737345|2.0|But that's not saying much.  Sorry, but I can't HELP but compare it to the Wim Wenders products and this is SO Hollyweed it hurts.  While watching the flick, myself and a friend of mine (yes, a chick who thought it was goofy too) figured out the ending LONG before it happened because we could just TELL it was going to be some carefully-calculated-to-pluck-the-heart-strings-in-that-shallow-hollyweed-way type of movie.  Meg Ryan is capable of acting, as is Nicolas Cage, but both were pretty uninspiring in this.  She just didn't seem very doctor-like, and he didn't seem very angel-like (kept picturing him in 'Leaving Las Vegas') in this.  The story's fault as much as anything.  The WHOLE mood of the flick is so somber, but fakely so.  I just didn't develop any empathy for the characters. <br /> <br />And yes, I am someone who can be moved by a movie... this fake Hollyweed stuff just doesn't accomplish much though... <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and check out the Wim Wenders flicks.  Weird at times, but so much more engrossing than this emotionally empty schlock (I know it SEEMED emotionally charged, but that portrayed/acted-out emotion has to be believable in order to actually convey anything). <br /> <br />BUT, if you liked \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" you'll likely be misty-eyed over this tragic tear-jerker that takes a deep (as deep as Hollyweed usually gets anyway) and moving (I wanted to move off the couch and go to bed) look at the mystery of life, love, and loss... <br /> <br />The soundtrack is decent though...
B000002I2M|5.0|Some of the finest work done by the Doors is on this release that could be called L.A. Blues as only the Doors could do!  A great listen!
B000002H2H|5.0|You might be saying what the best metallica but what about killem and the infamous black album or even the amboitous Puppets. Well ride the lighting while it didnt start the thrash revoultion invented everything else that was involved in metal after this point. The album itself is mixed perfectly you can hear anything from gut wrenching solos to james singing or growling his heart. The only person who really falls flat his Lars because after his awesome double kick on Fight fire with fire you dont get to hear much else until Ktulu. The tracks are all increible and this is when Metallica started taking a deeper route with there lyrics. The result are songs like ride the lighting, for whom the bell towls, and fade to black. The last is probley one of the finest songs Metallica or any metal band has ever written. The reason it is the best Metallica ablum is because it offers you everything you want in a metal ablum. Master while coming in a close second offers just as much but just doesnt have the song packing whallop as ride does. I recommend with any fan remotely intrested in metal you will not be dissapointed
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors may not have known it at time, but this release would turn the music world on its ear and open up whole new musical frontiers.  The world is a better place for it!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This album is great, it is nice to see a metal band that has the guts to be creative and not just play 3 random power chords really fast, scream over it and call it a song. This album has some of the hardest metal you will hear and some of the softest songs you will hear, it has some dimension to it and some listeners cant seem to handel music with more then one side to it, I think it is time for people to grow up and and stop calling every metal band that releases an album that isnt a never ending noise fest a sell-out
B00003CXCT|5.0|OK, so it's not the original trilogy - yeah, there are no more white boxes around all the spaceships, yeah, the Mos Eisley spaceport no longer looks like it was shot in somebody's back yard in Arizona - sure, the sound FX are now optimized for todays home audio equipment - all a tragedy, right? <br /> <br />Come on, you know you want it!  I for one am glad Lucas is keeping these excellent films up to date!  There is nothing I hate more than watching old movies from the 70s and 80s I used love and having to turn off my Surround Sound because the hiss and over-modulation is just too unbearable!  THANK YOU Mr. Lucas for doing this for us!  The original films are part of our heritage, and I relish those summers waiting for Star Wars to come back to the theater each year - but that was then and this is now!  Now, I want updated sound and SFX - and Lucas will deliver that for us!  I think the new movies are great as well - a little lame in the writing/acting department, but nearly flawless in the CGI category!  I love nothing more than a good movie to kick back and blow out my windows with! <br /> <br />Now, Lord of the Rings is definitely the new Trilogy to beat - but Star Wars is still top notch - as for you whiners out there - guess what?  You don't HAVE to buy it!  Stop complaining and start re-dubbing your Pan-and-Scan VHS copies! <br />
0743243315|2.0|Say SLOW and say it SLOWLY. It gets two stars because it's about 200 pages overwritten, and the author deserves a star for all of that extra work. <br />This was one of the most excruciatingly slow books I've ever trudged through.  Can you imagine a book in which a devoutly religious woman has an affair and you can read about the whole thing without batting an eye?  All of the emotion is told- you don't feel anything. When the affair had ended, it had all of the spark of cold water.  They practically ended by saying- \\"it was nice to have met you have a nice life.\\" <br />Would you take pains to read a book in which one of the main characters daughters is so insequential that when her name is mentioned you want to say...who is that again?  Everything she says can be cut out of this book and you would never know the difference.   <br />Let's not even start on the half English letters from the ghost sister Hasina! <br />There is a story somewhere in here.  The book is 369 pages, and in all honesty it probably could have been effectively written as a novella of 100 pages.  The rest is fluff, smoke, mirrors long laborious passages.  Why wasn't all of this mentioned in the praise and accalades? <br />If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time.
B00028HBKM|5.0|As a Christian of the Roman Catholic faith, I found the movie to be astonishingly powerful and moving. It's a movie which almost demands the viewer to ponder his or her concept of,(and relationship with ), the Diety.Any movie which can accomplish that is an extraordinary thing indeed.
B00029LNHS|2.0|The only reason why i give this Cd any stars is because of the appeal they get with having \\"club-friendly\\" fun beats. But I must say that songs with titles like \\"shut up\\" and the disgusting \\"let's get retarded\\" refrain from being tactful. In fact, i think the latter should have been banned for the use of the word retarded with such vulgarity. <br />
0375404635|5.0|This is an incredible book which I read during the summer, the book is about Esther, although much of it was based on the author's life. The book is set in the 1950's, when Esther was nineteen. During that time she had a metal breakdown and ended up in a mental institution. Don't let that scare you, the book is very deep and will make you feel like you're actually living everything that is going on. Sylvia Plath was a very good author, she had the gift of only writing a few words that could tell an entire story, I was able to finish it in two nights. The only ironic thing about the book was that six months after it was published, Sylvia was \\"sucked back into the Bell Jar\\" and commited suicide. This is a book like no other that will leave you thinking for a very long time.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|What a breath of fresh air! Alisha is that true raw talent which is so hard to come by these days. Our senses have been so warped by that \\"studio sound\\" we can't recognize true talent when we hear it. Alisha has a sound which crosses generations and appeals to both young and old conisours of music. <br /> <br />Keep on doin what you're doin sista.
B000002J0P|5.0|That's what I thought when I first heard this recording and it is what I still hear. All three singers made great contributions.  The vocals are what grabbed me first.  Even though there was nothing exotic about the harmonies, the sound was exotic because of the blend of voices.  Then the songs, all of them at some time or other, because they all work beautifully.  At the time it seemed like Stills was all over the album, and he probably was.  After years, everybody's contribution seems clear and strong.  I agree with the comment that the band with Young was edgier, rocked more, and had more kick, but this album still fills the air with a light, seductive breeze.  A keeper.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is the alpha and the omega.  Its were it starts and were it ends.  Its amazing to thinck its from the same band as St. Anger.  CAn they just change there name now.  Clif please come back to us.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am amazed at the thorough defense Michael Moore's web site, michaelmoore.com, gives the facts in this movie! I enjoyed the movie, even though I was nauseated by the truth about the Bush administration- Some things I almost wish I didn't know. <br /> <br />This movie has effected me deeply. My mind has been completely changed on a number of issues.  It has to be watched. <br /> <br />You have to see the ending of this movie! <br /> <br />
B00005JKC3|1.0|Incredible Hulk tv series is my all time favourite and I am biggest fan of Bill Bixby.    The Hulk was slow paced, confusing story, poor performances and the ending was terrible. Sadly, Ang Lee was always risk and the not right director in this film.
B0001CNPLI|4.0|I don't see why this film has been banned since 1983, but damn there was alot of victims at the hands of the assassin. The child's voice as the narritive was a good touch, it gave the movie a kind of serious tone. Shogun Assassin is just a portion of a series in the lone wolf and cub series, but the most bloody, so try to check out all Lone Wolf and Cub movies to get the full feel.
B00003CXCT|3.0|These movies are classics because they were made on a shoestring budget and because the technology was top notch back then. The added special effects were not bad, but they were not really needed. Rumor has it, George Lucas want to add the ghost of Hayden Christiansen (young Vader) anlong side the ghost of Yoda in Return of the Jedi, and in my opinion that is going way to far. If George Lucas really wants to make some money he should release the original untouched versions on DVD also.  <br /> If the Hayden rumor is true, Lucas needs to be institutionalized so he keeps his damn hands off of these classic movies.
B0000399WI|1.0|I'm sure no one's disputing that The Shawshank redemption is a bad movie. However, I would like to go further, and suggest that Shawshank redemption is one of the worst movie's ever made. For starters, it's got Morgan Freeman in it. Morgan Freeman(this spelling may be wrong, but I don't care) is a man of limited talents: he can play a guy hunting a serial killer, and sometimes the president, but when he tries to act he's terrible. And you know I'm right.<br /><br />Two: The film is really boring, goes on forever, covers a span of decades yet the cast never age(Morgan freeman should be dead by the end), has voiceover to explain everything, is really sentimental, everything ends ridiculously happily, he escapes in a stupid way, it actually contains the tagline \\"hope can set you free\\" and so on and so on.<br /><br />Three: The film's star, Tim Robbins, actually said it was awful. He is right and you are all wrong.
0156027321|5.0|I cant rave enough about this book. I am forever deeply affected by this allegorical tale of a boy lost a sea with a  bengal tiger as his companion.  This story demonstrates that life, so complex it seems at times, can be cut down to one thing-survival.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Wildland fire air-attack pilot dies in an airplane explosion and is dispatched back to earth by an angel to mentor a rookie pilot.  Pete (Richard Dreyfuss)is the spiritual coach and he is not entirely confident about his mission, but he gives it a try and soon gets more than he bargained for when the girlfriend (Holly Hunter) he left behind begins to fall in love with his student.  Pete tries to derail the affair with his angelic  power, but instead learns about true love when his girlfriend contemplates death in a suicidal air mission to rescue smokejumpers trapped by a massive wildland fire.    This is one of Steven Spielbergs's more humble movies, a contemporary remake of \\"A Guy Named Joe,\\" and it is a charming and humorous story.  John Goodman is Pete's lovable best friend as the air-attack school commander, and Audrey Hepburn has a very nice role as Pete's supervisory angel.  The movie features a beautiful backdrop of forest wilderness with wildland fires combatted by smokejumpers and World War II-era attack bombers.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Many people seem to hate slipknot because they are \\"nu-metal\\" what does it matter what genre the mainstream classes music under? If you choose not to even give a band a chance  just because it is thrown into a genre you consider bad then you should try and be less narrow minded and broaden your tastes. It is completely pathetic the way people wont like music because it is thrown in a category with bad bands, <br /> Also many people  like to say slipknot have \\"sold out\\" by not doing heavy songs and playing songs with emotion and amazing acoustic guitars. <br /> I personally thing that is one of the best albums to be released this year and it is by far the best slipknot record, they have evolved so much over the since there first self titled album, yet they have not change there style completely, there are still the heavy songs (\\"The blister Exists\\" and \\"Opium Of The People\\" for an example) and yet they have changed by incorporating more slow emotion filled songs(\\"circle\\" and \\"vermilion prt. 2\\" for example.) <br /> If you have been a fan of slipknot then you should buy this and don't be so ignorant and say they've sold out because they have showed a broader musical talent and taste. Also if you think that slipknot have no form of musical talent and only scream and shout then you should listen to this album and it will prove to you that your views are not true.
B00028HBKC|5.0|One of if not the best movies about Jesus Christ I have ever seen.  Very violent but it was needed to show the horror of what happened.  Definitely not a movie to take your kids to until they are older.  Would recommend reading the Gospels before seeing the movie to get a better perspective.  Wish there were no subtitles, I think they take away from the movie.  Mel Gibson's gut field on that issue was right on.  There are some creative uses of Hollywood in the movie but nothing that would detract from the theme.<br /><br />Overall, an A+++++++++++++++++++

B0002I831S|3.0|ok, I gave TOS BOX set season 1 three out of five stars. Now, let me tell you why. I docked it one star because of the order in which the episodes are shown. I for one think they should have been in the order they were filmed NOT in the order that they aired. The previous 40 DVD set presented them this way. Now I have to switch out discs left and right just to watch them in the correct order...I also docked it another star because of the price..! I paid $96.32 at Wal-Wart and saw it at Target for 99.99, I also saw it at Best Buy for $106.00. I think it should have been priced between $69.99 and $79.99..  The good news is that the episodes are amazing sound and picture quality for as old of a series that it is. The special features are good, although they are not great.

B000002UAX|5.0|El mejor disco de los Beatles y, en mi ranking personal, el mejor disco de rock de todos los tiempos.  <br />Crudeza, mstica, salvajismo, melancola, desnudez, deliro, onirismo, premura, enfermedad, embrollo, oscuridad, amor, odio, lucidez, locura y - sobre todo - Belleza Absoluta, conforman este doble disco donde los Beatles, muy conscientes de su posicin - a aos luz de cualquier gran grupo -, desatan por fin a sus perros y se quedan tan anchos. Es gracioso recordar que esta Obra Magna en su da horroriz a los crticos 'lumbreras' y a los oos fans anclados en 'Revolver'. Tambin es gracioso recordar que an hoy en da se considere a los Beatles un 'grupo pop'. No me extender ms.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|What can you say about the \\"Talking Heads\\"? One of the most creative and unique bands of their time, in whatever genre they're in, with a sound all their own, and love by anyone with a cool taste in music. This is a pretty sweet disc. It includes all the big hits like \\"Burning Down The House\\", \\"Psycho Killer\\", \\"Once In A Lifetime\\", and \\"And She Was\\", plus the great tracks \\"Building On Fire\\", \\"(Nothing But) Flowers\\", \\"Wild Wild Life\\", and \\"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\\". Also their great cover of \\"Take Me To The River\\" is on here. There's obviously some great songs missing, but if you need more you can get the 2-disc collection \\"Popular Favorites 76-92/Sand In The Vasoline\\", which of course is twice as good.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson's epic masterpiece is the feel good hit of the summer! Tina Turner shines in her role as Mary (especially in the memorable scene where she defiantly sings \\"Better Be Good To Me\\" while pleading her case before Pilate (a never funnier Adam Sandler!) and the casting of Bobcat Goldthwaite as Jesus is pure genius. Gibson's decision to have the cast speak the entire dialog in Esperanto points to his trademark attention to historical accuracy and detail! The DVD is jam-packed with extras...an entire brownshirt uniform and a miniature replica of \\"Mein Kampf\\" that you can read to the kids before bedtime! Hands down the best anti-Semitic propaganda film since Leni \\"Oh c'mon, it's just a movie!\\" Reifenstahl's \\"Triumph of the Will\\"! An excellent distraction from the war in Iraq and the 2004 election! Two steins up!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Look I dont need to tell anyone that Christina can sing..everyone who has heard her or has the album can attest to that..But I didnt expect to hear what I got on this album..Although her self-titled debut was awesome, this Cd showcases so much maturity and control that one has to wonder if this will be her last cd because it is so good...Christina really kicked ass on this album..Anyway, here are my faves: <br /> <br />Stripped 1&2&#62; I really wished she would have made this into a song..This beat is hot as hell and she really let people have it <br /> <br />Walk away&#62; I can feel her pain all over this track..Its hard to walk away from this song <br /> <br />Infatuation&#62; You know she got to bring out her latin side..as a &#34;tribute&#34; to her ex, this is a good song with nice flavor <br /> <br />Loving me for me&#62; the interlude before this is so pretty, and this song has such a nice jazzy, R&B feel to it..most probably won't like this song but its one of my top 3..gosh, its such a beautiful song...It what everyone wants and she sings and describes it so perfectly <br /> <br />Impossible&#62; working with the wonderful Alicia Keys, she definitely worked it on this song...Christina has attitude and it comes out on this record <br /> <br />Underappreciated&#62; another song that might not be everyone's top favorites, but I just think its a really good song <br /> <br />Beautiful&#62; it got played out, but I sung it for a school talent show so that should tell you how much I like it <br /> <br />Make over&#62; its such a cool song..It just rocks...I love how she shouts on here <br /> <br />Get yours-get mine&#62; for those not into sex at all, dont listen..this song is so sexy and it makes you want to go out and find someone for a one night stand <br /> <br />Dirrty&#62; such a party jam..you cant help but dance to this song <br /> <br />Singing my song&#62; such a gospel track..She really shows off her God-given talent on this song..It has such a strong message and is a great end to the album.. <br /> <br />Overall, this album f-n rocks..Christina, I dont know what to say..You are a pop goddess and you make incredible music..I dont care what anyone else says, you are dirrty, but your talented, driven and beautiful and I love you just the way you are!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|First of all i wanna announce that im not a hip-hop head, and rarely listen to it, 50 Cent is the most overrated rapper ever (although his debut album was top class), and G-Unit are probably the silliest most commercial rap group ever, their album was appalling too (beg for mercy). Id also like to say i think Jay-Z is very boring, and overatted, i don't see what hes done which is so amazing ?!? <br /> <br />Kanye is the new kid basically, and after making beatz for quite literally EVERYONE this year i was intrigued to why everyones lovin him so much. So i bought the album. Best album ever it is, the skits are short and unobtrusive, chattin about things which actually relate to kanyes life (apart from the workout section, which is just kanye messin around). The quality of the beats is unmatchable, every track introduces heavily filtered and mastered samples from other genres which make beautiful gospel-like vocals over his beats. Some of the tracks im not too keen on, such as 'through the wire' and 'breath in breath out' but the rest of the album is amazing, my favorite track is 'spaceship'
B000099T2L|3.0|Whassup everyone!! I like Beyonce..She is a very talented young woman..She can sing and dance her ass off..And although it kinda irks me when so many group performers come out with solo efforts, I kinda expected something good from her..Well.... <br /> <br />This album is alright..The song that really caught me was of course, \\"Crazy in love\\"..Can that song be any more tight??..Even if she didnt have Jay on there, it still would've been a hot song..Gotta thank Rich Harrison (who produced Amerie's album) for the tight lyrics and beat..Next is \\"Naughty girl\\", which is also another one of my faves..Its such a dance song..I wasn't really into \\"Baby boy\\" when it came out (I just figured she wanted to jump on the bandwagon with other people trying to work with Sean Paul), but after being forced to listen to it a thousand times, its a cool song..My other faves are \\"Be with you\\", \\"Signs\\", and \\"Gift from Virgo\\" (which I think is such a pretty song)..But the rest of the tracks I think are not that great and not that listenable.. <br /> <br />\\"Hip hop star\\" with Outkast is corny..\\"Speechless\\" is a ballad I can listen to but I rather listen to \\"Be with you\\"..\\"Me, Myself and I\\" is okay but the lyrics really suck..\\"Thats how I like it\\" is so bubbly Im surprised Jay even wanted to be on it..Its even cornier than \\"Hip hop star\\"..\\"Dangerously in love\\" is so not needed considering that they only made like one change to the song..And \\"The closer I get to you\\" would have been better if Luther sang it with an older female who could have really worked the song..To me, their age differences really show..Their voices are very good, seperately!! And lastly, (people might hate me for this),the \\"Daddy\\" song is alright but I just dont care..Everyone knows that her Dad plays a major role in her life and that her mom is just a wannabe stylist...I dont mean to sound harsh but I just turn the album off after \\"Gift from Virgo\\"..And if you happened to notice that I missed one song, thats how forgettable that is.. <br /> <br />Overall, its a good album, but if she is trying to reach it, she still has a long way to go for a classic!!!
B0000C9JFO|4.0|I liked the movie alot as you can see by my rating but there are two questions that I have after seening this movie. Whey did xavier not go after Neus (the hot spanish girl who oviously had a thing for him)she was way chiller than any of the girls he was with? The other question is what was the thing that Isabelle said that every man should know? That just killed me because I want to know
B0000TB01Y|5.0|One word can describe this CD and show is PHENOMENAL!!!  Idina Menzel really is at her best here I am so happy that she one the Tony and I believe with all my heart the show should have one best musical. I saw Wicked on Broadway August 1st with Idina Menzel and Jennifer Laura Thompson as Glinda who was Great but no one can replace the incredible Kristin Chenoweth who is featured on this Cd.  I abusultly love all the songs on this Cd especially Defying Graviety, Menzel's Vocal are at their best in this song.  I love the CD and show and if you have a chance to get to New York and see the show you wont be disapointed but if not the CD is a work of art BUY IT NOW!!!
0765310015|2.0|Gardens of the Moon is Steven Erikson's debut fantasy novel and the first of a projected ten--yep, ten--book saga from saga-happy publishing titan Tor.  Because of its scope, it's also a hard book to review.  The word \\"epic\\" has been thrown around to describe it, and perhaps it's an appropriate one: the book displays both the strengths and weaknesses of a fantasy tale that spans centuries and planes of existence.<br /><br />The strengths:  Erikson displays a prodigious imagination and broadly constructed world; GOTM is indeed a good example of world-building.  Some aspects of his magic system and assortment of enchanted objects feel fresh, as does the creation of a city illuminated by natural gas.<br /><br />The weaknesses: As might be expected with a new novelist, Erikson's storytelling ability lags behind his imagination.  The most glaring problem is that he can't seem to decide whether to tell the story from multiple, limited points of view (as George Martin does so well in \\"A Game of Thrones\\") or from an omniscient perspective.  More often than not, he seems to settle for the latter--which has the consequence of distancing the reader from the characters.  With so many characters in play, this proves to be a nearly fatal flaw.  I found it incredibly difficult to relate to any of the characters; the soliders and assassins blurred together, and few motivations and biographies came to light.  Often, simple clarity--where are they now?  is this before or after that?--was lacking and jerked me right out of the story.<br /><br />Speaking of, there's much less actual story than the book's density would lead you to believe.  An empire is trying to conquer a wealthy city on another continent, and a broad array of warriors, assassins, sorcerers, politicans, and--most intrusively--gods factor into the conflict, plotting and scheming away.  Yet, for all the surface action, the shallow characterization mentioned above never quite pulled me in and inspired me to care about the story.  I often felt as if I were reading an incredibly detailed, turn-by-turn account of an intense and long-running Dungeons & Dragons campaign--something intimidating and inaccessible to outsiders, with minimal emotional payoff.  Some will praise GOTM for 'allowing' the reader to figure out some things for him or herself, and that can certainly be a valid praise for a book (e.g. for \\"The Briar King\\" by Greg Keyes or anything by Patricia McKillip).  In this case, though, the lack of explanation and clarity seemed less than intentional on the author's part.  (And a final, minor irritation: though Stephen Youll's cover is eyecatching, I have no idea how it relates to the story or who the two warriors are supposed to be.  The title is tangential, as well.  Such is marketing, I guess, in this age of ten-plus book trilogies ...)<br /><br />In a nutshell, GOTM was tolerable.  And to be fair to Mr. Erikson, it was first published in England in 1999, and the standards for the genre may have changed in the past five years.  However, this note from Terry Brooks in \\"The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference\\" may have proved instructive: \\"The temptation to free-fall through a story chock full of incredible images and wondrous beings can be irresistible--but, when not resisted, almost invariably disastrous.\\"<br /><br />GOTM isn't disastrous, but I can't recommend buying it or committing to another nine servings.  Recommended as a used-purchase for fans of military fantasy or a library loan for general fantasy readers.  Two-and-a-half blood-red stars.as if I were reading an incredibly detailed, turn-by-turn account of an intense and long-running Dungeons & Dragons campaign--something intimidating and inaccessible to outsiders, with minimal emotional payoff.

0812550757|4.0|This book is one of my favorites. There is a Chapter called \\"Jane\\" that is soooo interesting. It explains co-dependency between a computer program and a human. It tells how the program goes into depression, then anger, and then forgiveness. The program \\"retreated into herself\\" and then learned to love from afar, just as humans do when we need to re-evaluate when we have become too attached to someone else. Very cool!
0312983867|5.0|I can't say anything negative about this book.  I laugh out loud every time Klough spells his name - \\"it's K-L-O-U-G-H-N\\".  Ha-ha.  Contrary to some of the reviewers, I think Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books just keep getting better.  Since Five I have been laughing harder every time.  Sure, some of the story lines are somewhat repeated (e.g. Stephanie being hunted down by mad man - again) but characters like Kloughn and Bender (?), and Jeanne add something new.  And who can get tired of the antics with Lulu, Saint Valerie, and, of course, Ranger and Morelli. <br />Most of the time I have to read is at 11 o'clock at night or on a long drive in the car, so I enjoy something light.  This is it.  If you haven't read a Stephanie Plum novel, this would be a great one to start with.  If you've read others and are dying to hear what in the world she'll get into next, this book won't disappoint.
B000021YQV|5.0|Listen here KarlMarxZapata, firstly the album is called Toxicity not ATWA you dork. Secondly how can you say Aerials is boring, if its so boring why did it get to #1 on the billboard modern rock tracks in August 2002 eh? Answer me that 1 Einstein. <br />Rage Against The Washingmachine is a band that pollute rock with that horrible rap music, let me guess you like Ja Rule too? <br />You need to quit whacking off to nude pics of Zach from when he did that freedom of speech protest and start listening to the saviours of music....SOAD. You god damn p***y.
B0000009OP|5.0|at the Ithaca 95 rainbow gathering welcomehome.org. I'd never heard of the band Morphine before that. This album is really quite amazing and hauntingly beautiful. The songs took me on the audio equivalent of a planetarium laser show as their voices rang out lamenting of lost loves. Morphine is one of my favorite bands, second only to Pink FLoyd.
0790731452|4.0|MARS ATTACKS is another one of director Tim Burton's extremely off the wall movies.  From the opening scene of the burning cattle to the devastation of the earth's most famous landmarks, this comedy is quite unusual.  The martians themselves are hilarious..a cross between the Gremlins bad boys and the little creatures from an old sci fi film called \\"They Came from Outer Space.\\"  Their language is funny and they have a demonic glee while fooling and destroying most of the big name cast.  The best moments come from Jim Brown and Pam Grier as an estranged couple dying to get back together; singer Tom Jones as himself; Annette Bening as the ditzy new age/redneck girl; Martin Short as the president's press secretary; Sylvia Sidney as the feisty grandmother; and Poppy, the dog, who mutates quite hilariously into Sarah Jessica Parker.  Of course, Jack Nicholson in perfect in his dual roles and even Michael J. Fox gets away with a nifty performance.<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful, combining the numbnut technics of the 50s with today's CGI effects.<br /><br />It's not as funny as I had hoped, but it still was fun to watch.
1400079179|5.0|Every year or so, a new fiction will thrill our literary minds but only seldom will a novel rock the literary world. Such is the case with the DaVinci Code. Critics of this book either site anti-Christianity or factual inconsistencies. However, I think that such criticisms miss the point. The DaVinci code IS fiction based around facts - facts not commonly known to most. Many of these facts are easy to verify. There is a Priory of Sion. There is an Opus Dei. There is controversy surrounding the Holy Grail. Discrediting Dan Brown's novel by comments related to the use of \\"DaVinci\\" instead of Leonardo's real name is ludicrous.  Dan Brown has a well-researched and suspenseful thriller that is hard to put down. Simply put, it is brilliant.<br /><br />Approach this book with an open mind and chances are you will enjoy it like so many others.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I watched this movie this morning, I am physically and mentally exhausted. This film was so powerful and moving. Anytime a movie is able to stir human emotion, it should be recognized. Sure, we all know the story, but it has never been delivered with such power. The scenery is great, the actors were amazing, the period was nicely recreated. Despite religious beliefs, this film stands as an epic. <br />
B000002ILG|5.0|Please ignore Mr Russ. <br /> <br />There is no more emotional guitar player than Vitto Bratta, and it is a HUGE loss that he gave up, and an indictment on the music business that \\"forced\\" him to make such a decision. <br /> <br />Brilliant album ... one of the few in my collection that has no weaknesses, anywhere.  <br /> <br />I remember an interview way back when Vitto was talking about Nuno ... he said that he was reminded of a 'graph' when he heard Nuno soloing. I can see what he meant, although I think Nuno is a phenomenal player. However, the key difference is that Vitto was never obvious, formulaic, or derivative. He was pure emotion in rock guitar, and I have no better album in my collection that exemplifies this. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|Like the others above, I have not yet seen the DVD set, but because Lucas DOES have alot of money; he will no doubt pour it into the set.  Besides, I hear-tale that he was impressed and inspired by his Buddy's Indiana Jones boxed set.  But my personal theory is that he is running low on movie-making funds and he decided to release it early so he can pour more money into his next flop* erm I mean film. <br /> <br />Now then, YES I HATE the new additions.  YES I will buy this set. I think mainly because I waited too darn long not to.  Besides, the most UNFORGIVEABLE thing that he has truly done...was the Greedo shooting first, thing.  You know it wasn't so much the 'shooting first'....except that the technique his team employed was ridiculously child-like.  It was more like an amateur, Macro-Media, Java, Flash, hack.  I mean, cutting out a still-frame and moving slightly looked unrealistic and just down-right hokey!  I can only dream that he's fixed this in this supposed new set. <br /> <br />Now, as for the old glory films that were the trilogy, I am not worried that I shall never see them again for I have 2 options left to me.  I own the prestigeous Ultimate THX-Certified Laser-Disc collection.  The final \\"cleaned up\\" versions of the film before they were mangled.  3 glorious, uncompressed, discs of each film.  5.1 surround sound.  Now that the advent of the dual-layer DVD burner exists at under 300 bux, it's now just a matter of finding a good Laser disc player on E-bay and Wa-La!  Instant Digital Classic!  OR, if you want the easier option, simply research and buy one of the MANY bootleg DVDs from China.  These have been available for the past 3 or 4 years.  Some even have cool special features.  Again, be careful which ones you get.  A freind got a set that looks like it was mastered from an old VHS copy;). <br /> <br />The last laugh is on YOU Mr. Lucas. <br /> <br />-Brandon
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Traditionally on stage, Peter Pan is played by an adult woman because of body type and voice and Wendy's father and Captain Hook are played by the same actor.  Staying true to the story of Peter Pan, they have chosen a boy to play the title role.  I must say they have chosen  a perfect actor, Jermey Sumpter, who was the age of 14.  Wendy's mother is Olivia Williams and Wendy's father/Captain Hook is played by Jason Issacs.  Lynn Redgrave plays \\"Aunt Millicent\\". <br />  This version is the first full-length, in color, theatrical version of Peter pan ever made.  It is beautiful to watch.  But I will add it is not a emotional as the stage versions we have seen on television in the past. <br />  The \\"years later\\" ending  when Peter Pan returns, mostly seen in the stage versions is not included in the final part of this film, but you can find the alternate ending (\\"years later\\" ending) and many other deleted scenes in the Bonus: The Darling House\\" section on your DVD. <br />  Destined to become a classic and will be around for many years to come just like Peter Pan.
B0001KL5DA|2.0|I liked the first season, but the second season has worn out my interest. Too heavy, far-fetched, and filled with gratuitous emotionality, like a cheap soap opera. Grotesque may be fun for a film, not for a long series.
031286504X|5.0|...as is the rest of the story, but I have to say that the last few pages are better than many, many endings I've read. The suspense I felt while reading only grew until the story finished. I can understand why the other readers reviews are so high. It should be in the top 10 of all horror stories.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|An interesting experiment that did not work. The album is spoiled mostly by the overslick production and the plodding, boring musicianship and arrangements. The end result is bland muzak versions of some of the most powerful songs ever written. If this had not been a famous artist, it would never have been released.
037571457X|5.0|At first glance, these black and white illustrations are  <br />deceptively simple.  However, each frame of this graphic novel <br />contains a tremendous amount of emotional detail.  The text is intelligent and sophisticated but also deceptively simple because it is clear and straightforward.  Above all, this autobiographical story which charts Ms. Satrapi's childhood until age 13, provides one of the most realistic depictions of a child's inner world -- her curiosity, her joy, her fears and even her own narcissism and envy.  Amazing in every frame.  This would be a great companion pieice to \\"Reading Lolita in Tehren.\\" <br />
B0001XAPX8|3.0|I knew little about The Human Stain before watching it, but I presumed a film with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Senise, and Ed Harris had to be good. <br /> <br />Those players were certainly outstanding in their individual performances, but I'm afraid the story itself did not come across as the gleaming finished product I was hoping for. <br /> <br />Like I said, the performances were excellent, and for the most part well cast.  Hopkins gave me what I expected from him.  Senise is steady and is an effective narrator.  Harris' role is smaller than what I forecasted, but his lines are delivered with just the right mood and strength.  Kidman, for me, really shone.  She is one of my favorites, and in this film she is eccentric, tragic, vulnerable, harsh. <br /> <br />However, as the plot untwists, I couldn't get past the possibility that Hopkins had been terribly miscast.  I won't spoil it for you, but this was a real distraction for me in the last quarter of the film. <br /> <br />The performances across the board were excellent, however, the screenplay and directing could not hold up the other end of the bargain.  The very intriguing premise of the film included race relations, political correctness, and sexual relations between people aged 40 years apart; but it never really did more than scratch the surface.  The story was enough to hold my interest, but it never pushed into very unfamiliar territory.  It was also undermined by some superfluous scenes.  I felt the foreshadowing in the first frames could have been omitted since it left the outcome of the film in little doubt.  Also, the final scene on the frozen lake was totally unnecessary and did nothing to bring closure to either of the characters' relationships.  The story itself seemed pieced together rather haphazardly. <br /> <br />All in all, I can only give this film a lukewarm recommendation.

B000000WCA|5.0|This is where it all began, folks. <br /> <br />You either love or hate the five British girls that took over the globe in the late '90s with their infectious pop tunes. And whether or not you believe the vocal talent was all there, you can't deny them of their charismatic and interesting personalities - ones that truly reflect onto this essential pop record. <br /> <br />From the first song to the last, a message for female empowerment is clear - which is actually very important (girl power, as they put it). Of EVERY past and current pop artist, NO ACT has EVER come close to being as blunt, colorful, and vivacious as the Spice Girls effortlessly proved to be. <br /> <br />This pop act is the real deal. Listening to this record, you'll either blast their music on your stereo, or you'll cringe. No in between - true artistry (no matter how cheesy). <br /> <br />If you don't own this record, you MUST consider.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Everything about this movie is extremely well done.  I wouldn't recommend buying this movie if you are one of those people who don't like to think or like the teen movies that are just spoon fed industrial copies of every other movie in the same genera.  The cast is great, the score is eerie and enchanting.   <br /> <br />I recommend getting this movie, turning out the lights, and enjoying an awesome movie that will take your full range of emotions and thoughts for a wild ride. <br /> <br />See you in the past.
0425152251|3.0|I have never before felt compeled to write a review...which may well say something about this book. <br /> <br />Although I am only half way through this book now, I feel I can say with conviction that this is some of the most awkward, stilted prose published. The philosophical sections fare better, but the sections that occur in the present are just sad, sad, sad. In fact it is so stilted that one suspects a botched translation job. <br /> <br />The hardcore content of this novel (the overview of history of philosophy)is fascinating in spite of being oversimplified. A young reader  may well discover in this book a point of departure for his or her intelectual life. It succeeds wonderfully in creating a sense that intelectual history is an ongiong continuous conversation through the ages. All of which is quite an acomplishment. <br /> <br />It pains me to think how many young readers will not get past page 50, not because the philosophy is too hard, but because the story is just lame. And it is not hard to imagine that some, if not most, teenagers would find the tone of the \\"novel\\" section and character of Sophie condescending. <br /> <br />All in all: A good service to philosophy, a near insult to literature. <br /> <br />(i take all responsibility for my misspellings)
0679428895|3.0|This must be the year of the historical epic, both factual and fictional.  I had just finished Eric Larson's wonderful Devil In The White City and James Dalessandro's astonishing 1906, trading the latter to a friend for Pompeii.  I must tell you, I was greatly disappointed by Pompeii.  Yes, Mr. Harris is a fine researcher, he had every tool and article of clothing down to a science, but I have a hard time understanding how anyone could consider this novel suspenseful.  The main character, Attilus, a young engineer on the Roman aqueducts, finds out very early in the story that sulfur has somehow leaked into the water system, and the there must be a break in it somewhere, which is why the water has been reduced to almost a trickle in some spots.  Good, let's get to it:  the problem is, 125 pages later, they still haven't gotten to the break in the water.  What we have is banquets and tool gathering and drinking and childish bickering and a fledgling romance that is so marginal you wonder why Harris even bothered.  When he finally does get to the volcanic eruption, you are exhausted from plowing through all that minor details and tedious characters, and then wham, the whole disaster is over.  It took James Dalessandro as long or longer to get to the 1906 earthquake, but every page was riveting, full of color and conflict, with a sense of suspense and urgency that had me squirming.  With Harris, I could not wait for that section to be over: I had to constantly force myself to plow through it waiting for the emotional and physical pay off.  I thoroughly enjoyed Harris' Enigma, and respect his scholarship, which is why I gave him three stars.  But Raymond Chandler once said that the British may not be the world's best mystery writers, but they are the world's best dull mystery writers.  This is dull, and tedious, and I hate to say, but boring for long stretches.  Try Isaac's Storm, or Seabiscuit, or 1906 for mesmerizng historical fiction or journalism.  I have several friends who agree with me on all of the above.
6305842442|4.0|...all time.  And a good private eye story to boot.  Like Spenser, Deckard gets way too involved with a case (see the novel, \\"A Savage Place\\") and pays for it.    Secondly, much was made about this movie giving \\"hints\\" that Deckard was a replicant.  The only one, and it's a slender one at that, is when Rachael asks him if he's ever taken the replicant diagnostic \\"test.\\"  He avoids the question.  THAT's supposed to be the hint he's a replicant?  Perhaps the rumored (and I notice the rumors are a year old and no three disk set has appeared; of course Ridley Scott's been busy...) three disk set will shed more light on this.    The influence of this film's look is most easily found in the \\"Matrix\\" triology.  Unfortunately, the Wachowski brother's homage was a little too slavish and it's easy to confuse some of the exterior shots because of this.  (Especially Neo's first meeting with Morpheus; tell me that the exterior of the building couldn't have been cut from the exteriors of the J.F. Sebastian character's apt. building!)    Digression aside...I saw this movie in the theater when it was released in 1983, when I was twelve.  I remember it having a huge effect on me as a science fiction fan and a movie lover.      I don't buy that the \\"original\\" release had a happy ending.  Neither the \\"noir\\" nor the Private Eye genres (much as they overlap) demands an \\"unhappy\\" ending.    All the original ending did was show you what would have logically happened when Deckard and Rachael left his apt--they would have escaped!  To call the priginal ending the \\"happy\\" one and this one whose ending is the movie with them in the elevator is the \\"properly\\" sad one, is both purile and irrelevant.    What do you think he would have done with her?  Taken her to Bryant?    Two things that this movie left incomplete: the original completed the hint given by Deckard regarding Rachael's \\"expiration\\" date in this one (it's in the \\"narration\\" eliminated for this version by Scott).  When she inquired, he evaded the question with, \\"That's classified.\\"  That's the \\"big\\" hint?    The removal of the narration was also jarring.  I thought I had screwed up burning my archive copy (perfectly legal as we all know) and missed an audio subchannel.  Nope.    It somehow feels like something's missing.  I think the movie should get a B+, but since we can't give letter grades or -/+'s, I'll still leave at four stars.    The outdoor scenes are still spectacular.  If the scare about America \\"turning Japanese\\" (those of you who are dry behind the ears will get the song reference) so prominently displayed in both versions seems dated, that's because it is.  It's American culture and power that dominates, not Japanese.  So, Scott got that completely wrong.    Also removed is Philip K. Dick's credit; the movie's based on his short novel \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.\\"  Very odd.  I remember the \\"novelization\\" has his name and the old title prominently displayed.    But all the basic things that made this an sf classic are still there.  It's still beautiful, the character of Deckard is still compellingly drawn and Shawn Young is still meltingly goregous  (second film crush after Lt. Saavik!).  I couldn't help but simply stare at her face.    The criticism of both the audio and video transfers is wildly exaggerated.  I viewed this on both my TV, even with 2.0 Audio  the VanGelis soundtrack sounds awe-inspiring.  The transfer is decent.  (If it looks good with a 64MB video card, it'll look good on your high end TV--which doesn't have the resolution of my monitor anyway.) It could have been a lot worse and it's a lot better than some transfers of movies that have come out a lot more recently.    It's too bad the original version is no longer available.  I may have it on an old VHS tape somewhere (let the critics of the transfer watch that and see if they still complain!).  I hope so.  The comparison would be interesting.    To reiterate, the criticisms expressed by the editorial reviewer and several fans are silly and little import.  The core story is intact and the narration really wasn't needed.  We just expect to hear it (especially those of us who watched it a gazillion times as a teenager on HBO), so the absence of it is, as I said, jarring.    Whether a \\"newbie\\" to the film or your first time seeing it on DVD, this movie, it's star (and, to clear things up, Mr. Ford is a \\"star\\" not an actor) and director achieved something unique; whose influence has echoed thru sf and film for over twenty years now.    If for no other reason, kind of like listening to Hendrix even if acid rock ain't your thing, you should watch it to understand how Scott changed sf films and cinematography in general.    Pro: same great story, etc    Cons: lack of any commentaries or extras of any kind    Big Con: as one fan already noted, there was no reason not to have made a \\"flipper\\" (since dual layers weren't available when DVD first appeared but I may be wrong about that) with the original on one side and the DC on the other.    But those are gentle bitches.  It still takes your breath away and still leaves you uncomfortable with Scott's dystopic nightmare.  As with all great sf, we are left asking ourselves,  how much of this future is in OUR future?
B000002OX3|3.0|If you're a hard-core fan, you have to have this album, if for no other reason than to see how far the group came from the campy, Mod \\"High Numbers\\" to the punk \\"World's loudest rock and roll band.\\" <br /> <br />The only cuts worth hearing are \\"Happy Jack\\" and \\"A Quick One,\\" which were the title tracks for the U.S. release and The U.K. release, respectively.  (U.S. distributors thought the U.K. title a little too risque at that time...) <br /> <br />The two Beach Boys cuts are pretty good, though not original who songs, and one can enjoy the other original cuts if taken in context: the band was eager to rush this album out of the studio and it shows.  But the real reason to have this LP, as i've stated, is to gain a further appreciation for how the band developed over the next 5-8 years. <br /> <br />The \\"cello-cello-cello\\" part on \\"A Quick One\\" is hilarious; the band couldn't afford real cellos, so they voiced the parts, making for a quirky but enjoyable addition.  The guitar interlude on \\"Happy Jack\\" foreshadowed a lot of Pete's grinding, pulsing chords in later singles. <br /> <br />Some tracks will have familiar foundations that can be recognized in later works, but i think it's more noticeable if you listen to other albums like \\"Who's Next\\" before buying this one.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I finally rented The Passion, today, to see what all the controversy was about, and how the movie was depicted, and quite frankly, I was very disappointed.  The acting was not the greatest, the story is not Biblically based, but rather taken from the visions of a 19th century nun named Catherine Anne Emmrich, and her book The Dolorous Passion.  Things like the scenes with Satan chatting with Jesus, the table and chair scene with Mary, the overflogging of Christ, the quick jump to an odd resurrrection scene, are simply Mel's version of what he believes happened.  I did not come away with any sense of salvation or Christ's teachings and purpose on Earth, but rather with a sad feeling that most people who rave about this movie have never read the Bible, nor have any grounding in history or theology, but will still take this as the Gospel truth, which it is not.  For a much more accurate portrayal of the life of Christ-the entire life of Christ-please rent or purchase the mini-series Jesus of Nazareth, starring Robert Powell, and get the true message of Christianity, no matter what denomination you are.
B000002P2W|4.0|This is maybe the Who's most under-rated LP ever.  Some of the work on this disc is terrific, but it never got a lot of radio play and has been panned as \\"too depressing\\" and the like.  There IS a lot of melancholy in it, but take a listen to most of the grunge and alt music that has been produced since 1989, with much more inferior accompaniment... <br /> <br />However Much I Booze is a wonderful tune, as is Blue, Red and Grey.  But these are polar opposites; \\"Booze\\" is very much a Who song, complete with crunchy guitar licks and Keith's drum-bashing, while BR&G sounds so out of place with its mandolin and Entwhistle's horns.  One of the best songs on the album has to be Dreaming From the Waist, which became one of the best live-performed songs of the band's repertoire up until Moon's death.  (A fantastic live version of this cut appears on the \\"Who Put a Better Boot In\\" album, recorded at Swansea.) <br /> <br />Should be right up there with the best Who albums, in my opinion, even if it doesn't sound much like their stuff recorded from 68-73.  Softer and more sophisticated.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Amazing and powerful film...the DVD is a let down. Absolutely NO features, not even a trailer reads...play movie, language selection and scene selection. Well, I guess the movie wasn't all THAT popular to begin with, eh? Ha!
B000002P2V|3.0|This isn't the greatest Who album, as other reviewers have shared.  The declining skills of Keith Moon and the increasing bitterness of Pete Townshend mar what could have otherwise been a powerful romp through the disco era.  Daltry sounds as great as ever, and Entwhistle is steady as always, But Moon only shines on the title cut - which in my opinion is the only real Who song on the disc.  Guitar and Pen i like, and Sister Disco is clever, but i hardly ever listen to the rest of the cuts.   <br /> <br />Had Keith not died after this release, the band probably would have broken up due to lack of interest in their own craft anymore.  Knowing that this was Keith's last studio work makes this a must-have, and if you listen long enough you will grow to like some of the tracks.  In a weird way Keith's death re-energized the group, and Face Dances is a much better offering because of it.  Hard-core fans may be as disappointed as i am with this album but will buy it anyway.  It's still the Who.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|At first, I thought this album was too mainstream, and had a lot of sections that I hated, such as Labrie's rapping on track 4.  However, I realized this band was simply living up to its reputation of being a constantly changing band, or in other words, very progressive.  When people say this album was boring and a dissapointment, they failed to realize the amazing musicianship provided in every song.  For instance, the keyboard/guitar unison in \\"This Dying Soul\\" blew my mind.  The fact that Jordan Rudess can keep up with Petrucci's amazing shredding ability is ridiculous.  I'll admit it took me a while to realize the depth of this album and to look passed the nu-metal style, but I now see how this album lives up to the DT reputation.  What also really blew my mind was the fact that even with all the odd time and incredible musicianship, the band was able to somehow come up with lyrics that fit the odd time and flow of the song.  How do they do it?  Not to mention the fact that they wrote all this stuff in 3 weeks!!!  I highly reccomend this album if you are willing to look passed the nu-metal progression. <br />
6305428352|5.0|...this movie has recently had a profound impact on me.  I saw it in the theatre in 1996, when I was a senior in high school.  While I enjoyed it then, it is more poignant, tear-jerking and soul-enobling 8 years later as a 25-year-old.  My compliments to Hollywood for putting out a major flick whose message is that only human folly is responsible for not funding quality education of the arts for our children.    The only forgivable believability gap is that once Mr. Holland turns his teaching attitude around after his first five months, the orchestra gets TOO good, TOO quickly.  Up to January, the orchestra sounds as bad as humanly possible.  By the end of that same school year the orchestra sounds about as good as, say, the Cincinnati Youth Symphony, of which I was a member when I first saw this movie in 1996.  The Cincinnati Youth Symphony (or any Major American City, USA Youth Symphony) consists of the area's most advanced high-school-aged musicians.  These are the ones who are most likely the best player on their instrument at their local high school, regularly practice multiple hours a day and perhaps give up a certain degree of normal high-school life in order to excel on their instrument.  Regardless of how much of a \\"genius\\" Mr. Holland might have been at teaching, it is impossible to believe that ANY orchestra can get THAT good, THAT soon.  And in a later scene in the movie, right before Mr. Holland sings Lennon's \\"Beautiful Boy,\\" the school orchestra is shown playing the final coda of Beethoven's \\"Eroica\\" Symphony, and they sound as good as a major professional orchestra, and I myself have played that piece with PROFESSIONAL ensembles that don't sound as good as the students of JFK High!  :)  Nonetheless, this criticism does not get in the way of the main messages of the film and does not warrant the docking of any stars.    At the end, when Mr. Holland tells principal Walters that \\"Cut the arts and... pretty soon these kids won't have anything to read andwrite about,\\" it reminds me of a Winston Churchill quote:  \\"If we're not fighting for the arts and culture, what are we fighting for?\\"
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well first of all I'd like to comment on  <br />Rochelle B. \\"Snobunnee20\\" 's review <br />and I have to say she is right. This album does have catchy tunes but the lyrics is too much sex-related compared to her previous songs <br /> <br />Some are or Ok though, especially everytime and toxic are my favourites <br /> <br />all the songs have a good beat and is nice to listen to aswell as sing along to....if you weren't to embarassed to sing the lyrics..... <br /> <br />i know she is grown up but shes trying a bit too hard and thats really dragging the younger fans away because there parents im guessing will think of her as inappropriate. <br /> <br />5 years ago when i was 9 back in 1999 her music was a bit more kid-friendly <br />now she's gone a bit too far to be liked by her fans but i personally think she's going the wrong way <br /> <br />still  <br />the songs and the tunes themselves are super <br />good <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000009SM|5.0|this record rocks,unbelievable zappa music, <br />the music is so well put together it just blows <br />me away,like can't afford no shoes,florentine pogan, <br />and all the rest like sofa 1 and sofa 2,this is a great <br />record to buy.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to rap and Eminem in particular (back in the year 2000). And, in my limited experience, I feel obliged to pay my respects to this impresario! I can say that this is a truly classic album! Wonderful Beats and true-to-himself lyrics! Yeah this is what made him a star! <br /> <br />I'm yet to hear a song more powerful than 'Stan'. The talent really rings out, with Em singing in two voices - the sucidical/inconsollable/deranged/depressed fan, and then the cool-as-a-cucumber star!. <br /> <br />The super-hit; The Real Slim Shady, has Slim taking on the likes of everyone i hate! from Christina to Clinton to boy bands and some! <br /> <br />Songs like 'I'm Back', 'Remember Me' 'The Way I Am' and 'Who Knew' has Em giving hell to all of his critics! <br /> <br />Then there are songs like 'Kill You' which come across as misogynic. Here, If you understand what Em is trying to say, you will symphatise rather than hate him! <br /> <br />And pal, when you're having a realy-real bad day, jump to 'Under the influence' (my fav song!) and tell all of 'em to suck that infamous part of your anatomy! hehehe <br /> <br />Everyone, no matter what country, race or religion, can truly identify with the songs. Legends like Pac talked about Equal Rights and Biggie talked about dough and hustling, but Em talks about just being himself; and all the problems that come about when people try to be true to themselves! Eminem is a Existentialist Philosopher! <br /> <br />People try to bad-mouth Eminem most of the time! Misogynist, Homophobic, Faker, Racist and what not! I DON'T belive them! For me Eminem is dope! <br /> <br /> <br />Go Buy it man! you won't regret your intelligent decision! This is a must-have album on your baddest days! <br /> <br />Cheers, <br />FF <br /> <br /> <br />p.s. btw i am not a white kid!
B0000009TJ|5.0|I think that this is one the best live zappa  <br />that I have heard,it just rocks,I love his version  <br />of ring of fire and the live versions of zomby woof, <br />florentine pogen,find her find her,stairway to heaven, <br />and to top it off the swaggart stuff was really funny,I <br />listen to this cd a lot,because I am a big zappa fan,this  <br />is another great live record to buy,the band is incredible, <br />this record deserves 10 stars.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie is one of the saddest I've ever seen, but its necissary to watch this movie.  It shows you the most truthful portrail of the Holocause yet.  We watched this movie in English, and i can garintee that more the half the class cried at one point.   <br /> <br />When i read things like: <br />--we watch this every christmas eve before we put the children to sleep. It is a wonderful family oriented comedy.-- <br />It makes me want to cry.  I'm not jewish, but the Holocaust was the worst thing to happen this whole century... Who could say somthing like that!?  This is a terrific movie becuase it tells the truth about somthing we need to know, so that it never happens - ever - again!   <br /> <br />
B000006Y12|5.0|What con one say about this album? Perfect in anyway you want to look at it. \\"The Gallery\\" was released in 1995, the same year as At The Gates' \\"Slaughter of the Soul\\", and a year after In Flames \\"The Jester Race\\" (band that switched singer with DT for these albums). The scene was at its best. Dark Tranquillity proved they had nothing to envy of these bands, and released one of the best death metal albums to come out of Sweden ever.    I agree with most of the reviewers featured here so, if you've read any of these reviews I warn you in case you want to keep on surfing. Otherwise, keep on reading. \\"The Gallery\\" is simply amazing, from beginning to end, with no fillers or weak songs. You'll find cascades of melodies, epic or classic, one after the other, mixed with catchy rhythms and solos and the most creative parts and arrangements, combined with different speeds and tempos. All this made a very dynamic and versatile album. But these words make no justice to this album's greatness. You'll have to listen for yourself. everything carefully arranged, setting their own particular and technical style. \\"The Gallery\\" is 100% pure Swedish Metal blood, without using any sampler or electro stuff, just guitars, bass and drums, and lots of folky elements, put together with originality and style and perfectly arranged. That's talent! For example, the addition of female vocals in a couple of songs, and many more.  From the first riffs of \\"Punish my Heaven\\" you know you're into something interesting or special. The album has a good sound that wiil let you enjoy all the marvellous melodies, like the ones in \\"Denspring\\" or \\"The dividing line\\", or the magnificent solos of \\"The Gallery\\" and \\"...Of melancholy burning\\"    I confess you that I had a couple of DT's albums, but not \\"The Gallery\\". I've never been a huge DT fan, but I liked their albums though. One day I enter into a local store, and found the album on sale and then got it. I admit instantly falling in love with this album.If you're into swedish death metal or metal in general, and don't have this album, you're missing one of the biggest milestones of swedish metal.    ps: in this edition you'll find a nice Metallica cover, \\"My friend of misery\\". The album is worthy itself alone so, with or without cover I recommend you to get it anyway!
B0002DB50E|5.0|Videodrome is a rare horror film that is as smart and thought-provoking as it is scary and gory. Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg was fresh from the success of Scanners and this film would continue his fascination with blurring the boundaries between man and technology. Universal previously released this movie on a bare-bones DVD. The folks at Criterion have now given it their deluxe treatment with a beautiful transfer of the uncut version and an impressive collection of extras for fans to enjoy.<br /><br />In keeping with Criterion's excellent attention to detail, the two DVDs are packaged in a case designed like one of the notorious Videodrome cassettes. All of the DVD menus are designed like pirate broadcasts. It is a nice touch that enhances the experience of watching the movie.<br /><br />There is a 40-page booklet that features three essays. The first, by Philadelphia Inquirer film critic Carrie Rickey, traces Cronenberg's career from his low-budget horror roots with Shivers to his current status art house fave with Spider. There is also an exhaustive essay on the making of Videodrome by Video Watchdog editor Tim Lucas, and Gary Indiana rounds things out with his thoughts on the movie.<br /><br />The first disc features two audio commentaries. The first is by director David Cronenberg and the film's director of photography, Mark Irwin. This is a fascinating, thoughtful track as both men speak eloquently about their craft and the movie itself.<br /><br />The second commentary is by actors James Woods and Deborah Harry. Woods, always the animated talker, not surprisingly dominates this track with his insight and entertaining comments.<br /><br />Rounding out this disc is a six-minute short film directed by Cronenberg, entitled \\"Camera.\\"<br /><br />The second disc starts off with a superb 27-minute documentary called \\"Forging the New Flesh.\\" It was created specifically for this DVD by the film's video effects supervisor, Michael Lennick, and examines how the incredible make-up and visual effects were achieved.<br /><br />\\"Effects Men\\" is an audio interview with legendary make-up artist Rick Baker and Michael Lennick.<br /><br />A real treat for die hard fans is \\"Bootleg Video,\\" which features the unedited footage for the faux softcore porn film, \\"Samurai Dreams,\\" that Max buys at the beginning of the movie. There is also seven minutes of footage shot for the Videodrome transmissions. Optional commentary by Cronenberg, Irwin and Lennick is available for these segments.<br /><br />\\"Fear on Film\\" is a 26-minute round table discussion with `80s horror film auteurs, John Landis (American Werewolf in London), John Carpenter (The Thing) and Cronenberg. This is a wonderful extra for anyone who grew up watching horror films in the `80s.<br /><br />There is a \\"Marketing\\" section that features vintage trailers, a Making Of featurette, stills and posters used to promote the movie.<br /><br />And finally, there is an extensive stills gallery with effects photos and production stills taken by Tim and Donna Lucas who were writing an article on the movie for Cinefantastique at the time.<br /><br />Videodrome arguably best represents Cronenberg's on-going obsession with the merging of man and technology, flesh and electricity. In this respect, it was very influential as evident with the same kind of ominous presence and effects of electricity as in David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me. The dangerous manipulation of a video image would also be explored in Lynch's movie, Lost Highway. Videodrome's influence can also be seen in the music video world with the notorious Broken music video collection (that played with staged snuff film imagery) by Nine Inch Nails.es how the incredible make-up and visual effects were achieved. <br /> <br />\\"Effects Men\\" is an audio interview with legendary make-up artist Rick Baker and Michael Lennick. <br /> <br />A real treat for die hard fans is \\"Bootleg Video,\\" which features the unedited footage for the faux softcore porn film, \\"Samurai Dreams,\\" that Max buys at the beginning of the movie.

0553208845|1.0|This book was so wordy it was hard to understand at times. It is hard for me seeing some one reading this book for fun despite that its called a \\"classic\\", Black Beauty is a classic, To Kill A mockingbird is a classic i wouldn't ever put this book in that class of amazing books.I gave this book one star on account that it helped me fall asleep so fast at night. I had to write a book report on this novel and it was unbelievable hard to stay awake wrirting. If i ever stub my toe and go to say a curse the one word i can think of saying is \\"SIDDHARTHA!\\" Spare your-self the agony and read another \\"classic\\"
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I really fill like \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" is a very good CD. I really enjoy everyhing from number 1 to number 17 or so. I give alicia keys 5 stars because I feel she is a great musician and singer. I really really love her style.
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|Green Day is back to their old roots (not to say I didn't love Warning) with their new single American Idiot. It's a pure punk rock anthem with great drums a strong message and an addictive chorus. Kerrang said Green Day have rarely sounded this good; I'd say they've never sounded so good. <br />Too Much Too Soon is a good rock 'n roll song with Green Day's punk rock vibe pumped into it. The lyrics are not political and go back to old Green Day (\\"Now it sucks to be you\\"...\\"I hope you rest in peices\\") Very cool song. <br />I've also heard the song Letterbomb from American Idiot (the album) and I can't wait to hear what Kerrang calls \\"Green Day's Masterpiece.\\"
B0002OOUP0|5.0|So, why release ANOTHER greatest hits collection right after 40 Licks? Well, it's one disc and focuses on the post-60s (re:post-London) Stones.<br /><br />Twelve of the eighteen songs on this CD appear on 40 Licks; all but one are on the second disc of 40 Licks.<br /><br />So here's whatcha do. If you've already bought 40 Licks, buy this CD, throw away the second disc of 40 Licks, throw away the packaging for Jump Back, insert the Jump Back disc into the 40 Licks case. Now you don't have to suffer throught the 4 \\"new\\" songs on the 40 Licks second disc or those lame 90s singles - Love Is Strong and Anybody Seen My Baby.<br /><br />Because this is a much, much better representation of this period in the Stones catalog. Even better would be to start with the 17 songs from Jump Back (minus Wild Horses which is on disc 1 of 40 Licks). Add You Got Me Rocking, Shattered, and Out Of Control (the live version from No Security). Now you have 20 tracks to make your 40 Licks Disc 2.
B00028HBKM|4.0|It is more than obvious that a story about the last 12 hours of Jesus' life cannot be as it was exactly, this goes with any movie based on a true story. We do know that Jesus of Nazareth existed and that his suffered extraordinary pain. If you are going to debate how he walked, or how he fell, or how he was put on the cross, please go watch something else. This is obviously not a movie where Mel Gibson hopped in his delorean and went to record the actual thing. This is only to give you a simple point: Christ suffered. <br /> <br />If you can deal with the truth that he did suffer, and that he felt pain, you should consider viewing this movie. Other stories told on television show a blonde man with blue eyes talking calmly on the cross.. Give me a break. The Passion Of The Christ shows a person who suffered extremely, and did not consider the situation enjoyable. Anyone with an understanding of what happened will understand the point of the movie, and will not debate un-necessary things that appear in the movie: Like who was sitting next to who, and why he wasn't pierced through his wrist, etc. No one is certain how he was put on the cross, so please shut up and don't make assumptions that no one knows. Thanks.
B00008ADPF|1.0|There is no way a normal person could enjoy that crap... I'm really opened to good music of all kinds but this is crap. However, If you like that crap, you might also enjoy some other crap like Staind, Puddle Of Mudd, Creed, Hoobastank. No Offense but you really should turn off your tv and television cause you have bad taste in music. <br /> <br />[...]
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I really don't see the point of this when \\"Anthology\\" has the \\"un-Spector\\" mixes..The mixes sound clean, and that's about the most I can say. The \\"fly on the wall\\" second CD are snippets of studio chatter and some playing. The biggest changes are \\"Maggie Mae\\" is not included, and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is included.  <br /> <br />Hopefully, the \\"Get Back Sessions\\" will have their due and show that even though there was tension between the band, you can tell they were still having fun playing together.  <br /> <br />What they could and should have done were:  <br />Bring the \\"rock and roll medley\\" from Anthology 3.  <br /> <br />But here's a list of songs (from the \\"missing\\" tapes they found a year ago)that would have been a nice addition to \\"Let it Be..Naked\\" or a \\"Get Back sessions\\" which had them revisit some Beatlemania songs as well as some things they'd use on the solo albums...  <br />All Things Must Pass, Three Cool Cats, All Shook Up, Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da, I'm So Tired, Hippy Hippy Shake, You Can't Do That, All Along the Watchtower, Short Fat Fannie, Give Me Some Truth, Back in the USSR, Every Little Thing, Piece of My Heart, Dizzy Miss Lizzie,It Ain't Me Babe, Lady Madonna, I Shall Be Released, When I'm Sixty-Four, She Said She Said, Another Day,Junk, She's a Woman, A Quick One,Build Me Up Buttercup, Back Seat of My Car, Madman, Every Night, Going up the Country, Rock Island Line, Another Day,Isn't it a Pity, Strawberry Fields Forever, and the recordings used on \\"Abbey Road\\" as well.    <br /> <br />
B00003CXCD|5.0|FYI:  I was looking for the widescreen version of this film, but discovered that movies shot prior to 1950's were only made in 1.33:1 aspect ratio.
B00028HBKM|4.0|The audio sounds great and the cinematography is great. It is definitely a film that should be seen in on a large screen though.  <br /> <br />The home video edition has subtitles in English and Spanish.  <br /> <br />No commentary (which I think Mel should do, (he did it for \\"Braveheart\\"), as well as the critics for and against the film). A film about the controversy surrounding the film would also be nice to see eventually as well... No behind the scenes, although the Diane Sawyer interview from earlier this year shows some of the \\"making of\\". Maybe Mel is waiting for the controversy to blow over enough to put it out in a \\"special edition\\" or \\"director's cut\\" or he's happy just leaving it be the way it is. No surprise considering he was going to put it out without the subtitles to begin with.  <br /> <br />What almost became the biggest mistakes of his career and a potential self-indulgent mess wound up turning him into one of the most wealthiest directors and actors ever.  2004 will be remembered for a year of controversial films (Brown Bunny and Fahrenheit 911 being the other 2 so far) that hasn't existed since the late 60s and early 70s.  <br /> <br />The question I usually ask before I buy a film is if I'll watch it at least 3 times in my lifetime. I don't see me watching it all that often, but often enough to make it worth buying, and then watching \\"Monty Python's Life of Brian\\" right afterwards.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This film really touched my heart and broke it at the same time. I 'm amazed Mel Gibson was able to pull off something like the trial and crucifiction of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I pray that everyone one would read my article and see the movie because once you've seen the movie you'll understand what our Lord went through.  <br /> <br />God Bless You All <br /> <br />Scincerly, <br />Addison Webb III
B00005JNEI|5.0|IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT who you should vote for see this MOVIE!! I have NEVER been interested in politics but lately it has become my obsession...my #1 goal...get BUSH OUT!! I just registered to vote for the first time in my life and am encouraging others to do so as well! So THANKS to Michael Moore for making such a great movie and opening my eyes to the truth! A VOTE FOR BUSH IS A VOTE FOR IGNORANCE!
B00003CXA6|4.0|Gettysburg is a fantastic movie and probably the definitive portrayal of the key Civil War engagement. Everything here is bang on the money - the action scenes are beautifully staged, the acting performances are spot on, and attention to detail is eye-candy to history buffs. Jeff Daniels in particular is absolutely fantastic as the Union officer who, against the odds, wins one of the battle's pivotal clashes. Sam Elliot adds a welcome dash of colour, too. Inexplicably, however, the film takes a sharp nose-dive in the middle when at some point Tom Berenger (GeneraL Longstreet) and Martin Sheen (General Lee) struggle vainly against a dialogue so lumpen and pompous that they both seem about to turn into marble. (Robert Duvall is in Gods & Generals a superior Robert E. Lee to Martin Sheen). And the inclusion of an observer British officer who struts around (complete with tea-cup and supercilious demeanour), is an appallingly two-dimensional, badly-acted parody of Englishness, and the movie suddenly lurches from masterful big-screen movie to sub-standard TV bilge in seconds. Gettysburg picks up again with the Little Round Top clash, when Col. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) first repulses a whooping Confederate attack and then, out of ammo, charges the enemy with fixed bayonets, driving the rebs from the scene and taking loads of prisoners. Hurrah!<br />For my money, however - and I seem to be alone in thinking this - sequel Gods & Generals is a far superior Maxwell movie, with even better acting performances, less synthetic-sounding music, grittier battle sequences and lacks the stiffness and that occasionally mars Gettysburg. That said, it is abundantly clear that this is nothing less than a labour of love by writer/director Ronald F. Maxwell.
B000002NJS|5.0|This CD makes me feel very fresh and energetic! Whenever I need revitalizing, I turn to Ray of Light. Every song on this album is an electric example of Madonna's extreme talent for giving out good vibes. From the deep emotion in Power of Goodbye to the comforting tone in Little Star (those are my two favorite songs from this album), this is feel good music at its best and every track is pure bliss. I use it to help me stay upbeat and happy when I work out or clean - hearing these songs make even the most mundane activities seem like fun. This is a super CD for people who are Madonna beginners, as well as old-timers who like a thrill!
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|This album was a nice attempt in teaming a legend with a variety of accomplished artists to provide one last offering to adoring fans and the music world in general. However, despite the best intentions this album doesn't quite live up to it's potential due to the failing health of Mr. Charles. Having grown up listening to his music this album summons my awe and generates feelings of sadness at the same time. I will always be amazed by Mr. Charles' unique and iconic talent. However, I'm saddened to hear him sing in such a sickly state. While he does rise to the occasion throughout the album his restricted  strength seems to limit this ability to create any real chemistry with his guests. There are times when the two parties fail to sound as though they recorded their song in the same studio. Nonetheless, I'm happy to have this album in my collection for the historical value, and I will certainly download my favorites songs onto my ipod. Those selections being Here we Go Again, You Don't Know Me, Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?, and Heaven Help Us All.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I'm tired of this \\"it does/doesn't sound like Joy Division\\", \\"it is/isn't innovative or revolutionary.....who cares. Fact of the matter is this is a great rock album, end of story. Why does it matter what influenced them, what they sound like, or if it's innovative...it's good, and that's what should matter. If you like good moody rock music check this album out, if not, go listen to all your great late 70's/80's punk rock music and keep ignoring the fact that music has continued on since 1983.
0195067142|5.0|I have an uncle who survived the Okinawa campaign.  Of the 30+ men in his platoon, 10 lived, he alone came thru unscathed.  He only talked about his experiences once.  That was right after he came back in the 40's.  He has related that carrying a flamethrower isn't a fun job, but no details at all about his service.  I can understand now why he has been tight-lipped about it.  It was a horrific experience.<br /><br />I got the book yesterday in the mail.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it last night.  The descriptions were excellent.  I was there.<br /><br />I have been a student of WWII since elementary school.  I was fascinated with the advances of technology that occurred then.  This book put a face on war that I don't ever remember seeing in the 35 years that I've studied that time period.  His story shows the brutality and low-tech nature of close combat.<br /><br />It is inspiring to see the determination to \\"see it through\\" that was exhibited by our men in WWII.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Mel seems to have been more influence by pictures on holy cards than historical fact related to crucifiction: Christ would not have carried the entire cross but only the cross beam (come on!!! after all that flogging and beating could anyone drag that entire cross???). Also, he would not have been nailed through the hands, but through the wrists. If he were nailed through the hands anatomically he would have ripped right off the cross! Also, if you believe the Shroud of Turin is authentic, then you have to note that the Christ in Gibson's movie was probably overflogged (in all reality, if Christ was flogged the way he was in Gibson's movie, he probably would have collapsed or died of blood loss (much less have been able to drag the whole cross). Now lets get down to money: with the release of this DVD today, no doubt many people will rush out to buy it right away. But wait, there's got to be more no doubt! No sooner will you buy this DVD then there will be the release of the supper special fat collector's edition with more interviews, previously unseen whipping scenes and the behind the scenes stuff. Then there will be released to newly remastered, superuncut, director's personal edition with three new songs by Disney (oops, sorry Disney, you bought out on this one and you''ll have to use your songs somewher else. Good thing for Mel on this count!) Anyway, it's nice to see religious movies comming into the theaters again. I wonder if Mel can think of a way to put out The Passion 2: \\"The Revelation\\"?
B00006879E|5.0|I've been listening to Maroon 5 for the past year and a helf now and I haven't yet posted a proper review. <br /> <br />Although some say they sound like a, \\"boy band\\" and others announce, \\"bad pop-rock,\\" they are sadly mistaken.  <br /> <br />Maroon 5 is a peace band - people need to get used to that. Sorry if they don't blurt out garbage of naked girls, sex, doing drugs, yelling, and worshipping Satan/God - they have sophistication on what they sing. Their songs are hooky, funky, and all around fun.  <br /> <br />They are very original and their music can become addicting. If you want a good CD to listen too and not something that gets old, Maroon 5: Songs About Jane is a good CD. Unlike bands like Modest Mouse, their singles blend in with the CD - Modest Mouse's \\"Float On\\" is a good song, however when you listen to the rest of the CD, it's acutally quite morbid. \\"Are you awake? Or dead? I hope you're dead.\\" etc.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: Good good music. Nice guys. Easy listening songs. Addicting.
1592400876|5.0|I have to admit that I really didn't expect to be as amused by this book as all the hype said I would be.  That said, I laughed OUT LOUD (which is something I rarely do when I am alone) at all of the grammar jokes and witty puns.  True, I am an Editor by trade; but, I choose to believe that I'm not the only one who will find this informative romp through the English language enjoyable.
B0000039PW|5.0|Now I'm a die hard Tupac fan, and a huge fan of West-side rap, but this cd...is awesome. I kind of hesitated to buy it, because I'm such a big Tupac/West-side fan...but I just had to find out what Biggie fans were so awe-struck about. Biggie is not the best rapper or lyricist but its safe to say he's among the best. When rap is talked about, Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G are always brought up, they're rap idols. Tupac is the rap God/idol, Biggie is a rap idol. This album is really good, in almost every song, Biggie tells you a full story from beginning to end, and you love every minute of it. The best songs on this cd are Everyday Struggle, Juicy, and Me and My B*tch. If your a big fan of rap, you NEED this album. Some other GREAT albums for rap fans are:  <br />2Pac-Me Against The World <br />2Pac-All Eyez on Me <br />2Pac-Greatest Hits <br />Dr. Dre-The Chronic <br />Snoop Doggy Dogg-Doggystyle <br />etc.  <br />~R.I.P. Tupac Amaru Shakur and Christopher Wallace aka Biggie Smalls~

B000002MJ0|4.0|I bought this out of a cut rack for $3.99. It sat in my CD tower for at least 5 years before I ever really listened to it.I couldn't stand the way it sounded over my stereo and I came close to trading it.I brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album.I really like the whole experience. I'm lucky I brought it up here-it was going nowhere at home but I'm playing it a couple of times a day over my headphones. I don't know anything about this band,I bought it on a whim,but I'd reccommend this album and I may follow up on this band.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Forget \\"Let Go\\". Sure it was Avril's record-breaking debut, sure it has the delightful pop hooks of \\"Complicated\\" and \\"I'm With You\\". But it wasn't Avril. So forget it. Consider this Avril's debut, because this is where we finally get to see the real her. <br /> <br />For \\"Under my Skin\\", the tiny Canadian rockchick ditched the Matrix and collaborated with renowned musicians such as Chantal Kreviazuk, her husband Raine Maida (Our Lady Peace) and Ben Moody (ex-Evanescence). This results in straightforward lyrics full of teen angst and a couple of very rocking songs such as \\"Take Me Away\\", \\"Together\\" and \\"Forgotten\\". Avril has never rocked this hard. <br /> <br />There are also softer songs though, like \\"How Does it Feel\\", where Kreviazuk's influence is especially clear, and the moving \\"Slipped Away\\" about Avril's grandfather, who recently passed away.  <br /> <br />The only downside to this record are the obligatory poppunk songs, that are mostly bouncy and don't convey a lot of emotion (mainly \\"Who Knows\\" and \\"Freak Out\\"). These songs are definitely not the album's stronger point. That lies with the emotional, honest songs.
B0002S94OS|4.0|Let's start this thing off by saying that i am a huge fan of all the metals (sans the nu and rap). I am also a huge fan of Lamb of God. This album displays all the traits i expect from Lamb of God. Virgin tight rhythms, cool drums, and unique/excellent guitarwork. Ashes of the Wake is kind of a mixture of the percussion driven New American Gospel and the guitar driven As the Palaces burn. It also displays more of their versatility, like the cleans in Remorse is for the dead or the softer parts in Break You. But one thing they'll never lose is their ability to make you want to beat the sh...I mean appeal to your more agressive side. <BR>The vocals are amazing. Randy remains one of my favourite voices in metal.<BR>But Being a guitarist, I loved the fact that Mark and Willie got to show off their chops with the likes of Alex Skolnick and Chris Poland on the title track. <BR>In conclusion, this ending sounds too much like an english essay.<BR>Lamb of God proves once again that they can kick your ass.<BR>I give this a four.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Here is just some light about The US Foreign Politics. Some people do not want to consider this is the truth. They prefer to be blind. They do not want to see it because of course it hurts a lot. In some countries ( like Spain ) they decided to banned a political party and elect another one just because of the war In Iraq. Hopefully this time in the US people will decide to be lead in an intelligent way. Most people will find some light in this movie. A few of them will just not listen or even worst, they will not understand.
B0002S94OS|5.0|If you are not familiar with Lamb of God and are wondering which album to give a try first, let me encourage you to begin here.  Ashes of the wake is the manifestation of the potential of Lamb of God.  Everything has matured and is easily recognizable to the familiar ear.  These guys are making everyone else in the metal world look like amateurs with a novice grasp of music (at best).  As opposed to their earlier efforts, the production on this album is impeccable.  Earlier efforts were marked by flattly mixed vocals, pappery thin kickdrum, virtually no bass, and guitars that leacked a bit in the meat department.  And those albums were invariably great music!  This album has all the ingredients of a classic, beautiful, haunting, and destructively brutal album.  the guitars are relentless, and include solos on alot of tracks tracks.  The usual stop-start riffing of Will and Mark is present in its expected bludgeoning glory, but this time the boys from Richmond don't stop there.  Not only are the riffs catchy and all too memorable, but there are textures that weren't apparent in earlier efforts. Walls of sound wash over you. Intricate minor seconds in breakdowns,and verses that build unbelievable power, only to explode into a new level on the chorus are commonplace.  The bass work is the best yet, with John pumping in time with the kick drum rythm most of the time, as opposed to alot of the newer bands that settle for root noting the guitars throughout.  The bass has a more metallic presence, similiar to that of the bass work in \\"Destroy Erase Improve\\" by Meshuggah, and perfectly compliments the drumwork and ties the whole molotov cocktail together.  As for the drumming, Chris is absolutely exemplary, without attempting to be flashy or a showboat.  The drums root the music firmly on the ground and help it to deliver the ballsy kick to the teeth that we metal lovers desire on a constant basis.  You simply cannot help but bang your head incessantly in time to the drums.The only low point of the drumming is the high hat that seems a little pushed back in the mix, and a little to metallic, but ut definitely doesn't take anything away from the album.  And lastly, Randy Blythe's vocals.....What can be said that hasn't been said a thousand times since these guys began their quest in Richmond VA.  I will admit when I first heard Randy's vocals years ago, I was a bit put off by them.  It sounded as if he were inward singing or something.  After a few listens though, you begin to understand that the emotions being poured into the lyrics are so powerful and lasting that they can only escape his mouth in the form of a sincere and trebbly yawp. However, on \\"Ashes of the wake\\", there are more than one dimension to Randy's vocals.  The album begins with a somberly spoken bit over the first riffs to the opening track \\"laid to rest\\" and quickly explodes into venom spewing anger.  Lyrically this album deals with the current conflict in Iraq, various other political topics, religion, and always anger and defiance in the face of persecution. Randy also incorporates a couple death metal growls, a black metal screech, and his genuinely feral screams remind one slightly of Phil Anselmo a la Great Southern Trendkill. It sounds as if his voice is getting deeper, which is no surprise given the abuse he heaps on his voice. It is inspiring. Overall there are not enough positive adjectives to describe this album.  The production is nearly flawless without being too slick or overproduced, there is real emotion on every song, every player is in peak condition and at the top of their game.  This is intricate yet harsh, inspiring and angering metal. All of the pieces are here, and I fully expect \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" to become as important to the world of metal as \\"And Justice for all\\" or \\"Seasons in the abyss\\".  It's the best effort from a group known for never disappointing.  If you disagree with me, go to a show and experience the wall of death.  All this praise and I have only owned the album for 24 hours! This is an album that will remain in constant rotation of any metal heads cd collection for years (possibly even generations) to come.  Five stars is pretty rare to me, and in reality, I think it only deserves 4.5, but these guys are really unique and definitely quickly becomming one of my favorites.
B00000DGRX|5.0|If you grew up in the seventies like i did, you are surely familiar with the excellent Machine Head album by DEEP PURPLE.  if not you are definately missing out on some primo seventies grooves.  The riff that launched a thousand ships in the form of SMOKE ON THE WATER is worth the price of admission alone. <br /> <br />featuring the MK II lineup (the classic lineup, if you will)this cd is a tour de force from top to bottom and a fine document of a truly great band settling in to it's rightful place in the pantheon of Rock Gods. <br /> <br />The extra tracks are more gravy for the goose!
6305508550|5.0|I agree with those who find this a superb comedy.  And, as with most great comedies, it is so largely because of its extremely incisive and insightful view of contemporary society, in this case of the absurd, boring, oppressive, and meaningless character of much of contemporary life and work as experienced by those who inhabit American corporations and organizations, especially those of a high-tech and bureaucratic character.  Thus it is high-quality social criticism in addition to being deeply humorous (as such other great comedies as Modern Times and The Apartment were in their times).
B00028HBKM|2.0|What a complete disappointment. I am actually shocked that so many people made such a big deal over this film. This film is made for people who beleive Jesus is their lord and savior. Gibson is not a historian, nor is he an authority on the life of Jesus Christ. This is his own biased, and very personal twist on possible historical events. He places incredible emphasis on the Jews as being the instigators of Jesus's death-and the Romans just following orders. I would not say this film is blatantly anti-semitic; however, because so many people  are ignorant and gullible-they are bound to draw the conclusion that Jews are responsible for his death-thus perpetuating hatred against Jews. Anyone who cannot see that-is blind. People are stupid enough to believe that life was created in 7 days-will just about believe anything.   As far as the DVD itself-it was awful. The subtitles were non-existant throughout the latter half of the film-and only flickered on occasion so I had no idea what was being said. I don't know if it was the copy I rented-or if all of the DVD's are defective like that.   Even with the lack of subtitles-this film only portrayed his crucifixion-but offered no insight. I thought it failed miserably, and the actor who played Jesus looks like every Christian, White Jesus. I thought the movie was an absolute joke.
0156027321|4.0|Overall, an entertaining book. The opening character development does go on a bit too long, so if you don't get past this (as Robert Katrin didn't) you won't get much out of the book. He may be correct in that this book isn't a great example of research, but that didn't turn me off to the story.    I have a bit of an aversion when I feel authors strongly superimposing their own beliefs on top of the protagonist, whether or not I happen to agree with those beliefs.     Otherwise, a fun and thought provoking story--excellent twist at the end.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 might turn out to be the most important film ever made.  The pathetic attempts to downplay this cinematic phenomenon are as transparent as the attempts to slander its director and as disingenuous as the administration that it exposes.  Of course, the film's political and social impact would not be possible if not for its artistic excellence.    As for the charge of propaganda, I think John Berger addressed this quite eloquently in his recent article in the Guardian:     \\"To denigrate this as propaganda is either naive or perverse, forgetting (deliberately?) what the last century taught us. Propaganda requires a permanent network of communication so that it can systematically stifle reflection with emotive or utopian slogans. Its pace is usually fast. Propaganda invariably serves the long-term interests of some elite.    This single maverick movie is often reflectively slow and is not afraid of silence. It appeals to people to think for themselves and make connections. And it identifies with, and pleads for, those who are normally unlistened to. Making a strong case is not the same thing as saturating with propaganda. Fox TV does the latter; Michael Moore the former.\\"    Like Bowling For Columbine, Fahrenheit 911 is alternately humorous and gut-wrenching.  We laugh at our inept and clownish president and then shudder at the consequences of his policies.  Moore hits hard with images of dead and critically wounded Iraqis.  One scene, in which a furious and indignant Iraqi man places a mutilated baby in the back of a corpse-filled pick-up and vows revenge, is particulary affecting.    Moore also interviews a mother of an American soldier killed in Iraq.  She is disillusioned - lost.  \\"Why?\\" she asks.  It is the right question and one answered quite thoroughly by this movie.  Are you not curious?
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album rocks! Much better than their previous self title album and IOWA. <br />In this album you can actually hear corey taylors TRUE TALENTS, here is how i rate the songs: <br /> <br />1 - prelude 3.0 - This is a decent intro, not heavy and no screaming, just singing.     9/10 <br /> <br />2 - The blister exists - This is ONE HELL OF A SONG, here is where things start to get more heavier, BUT this song can drag on for along time, and get very repetitive    9/10 <br /> <br />3 - Three Nil - Same as above, but still a very gd song  9/10 <br /> <br />4 - Duality - Their first single, because i bought this album a few months after it came out, i got bored of this song, but once again a super song, everyone should know this    9/10 <br /> <br />5 - Opium of people - THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE TRACKS, i dunno why but i love this song, i love the lyrics corey uses in the second verse, just listen and find out   9.5/10 <br /> <br />6 - Circles - This is a soft song, i was shocked when i first heard this, i was expecting all screaming from slipknot.

B000003B6J|5.0|I first heard Straight Outta Compton in seventh grade and completely flipped out.  I could not believe what I was hearing.  The beats were aggressive and funky and the lyrics were callous and cold, materialistic and mysoginistic - ugly.  There was also the timbre of the voices of the rappers themselves.  Ice Cube belted out his rhymes from the gut with a controlled brutality.  MC Ren had a cold, methodical sound and a masterful flow.  They wrote songs about violence, money, and bitches - nightmarish litanies that could only originate from one place - staight outta Compton. <br /> <br />My personal favorite is the classic anthem, \\"F!@# Tha Police\\" which so evocatively depicted the frustrations and mistrust of the urban black teenager directed towards police officers.  Long before Rodney King, Ice Cube bellowed, \\"...Police think they have the authority to beat a minority!\\"  This kind of blatant and uncompromising social commentary along with the brutality of the production and overall sentiment was what made this album so gratifying.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Straight Outta Compton spawned a whole genre of music based on expoiting poor minorities and glorifying violence and materialism, resulting in filling the bank accounts of rich, (mostly) white record company executives.  The music got soft and the message was lost.  Straight Outta Compton stands alone as a unique artistic statement that is still relevant today.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I've now seen 4 of the titles in this series -- this one and Aja (Steely Dan), Joshua Tree (U2) and Face Value (Phil Collins) -- and while I wouldn't give any of the others more than a couple of stars and wouldn't recommend them for anyone except basically hard core fans of the artists in question, this one is a very different story. Of course, the subject matter in this case is a good deal weightier and more interesting to talk about, given the subject matter taken up in the record. That may have been one advantage the makers of this film had as opposed to those other cases. It's simply very interesting to hear Roger Waters and sometimes other members of the band (always shown separately) discussing the ideas and emotions they were trying to express, and just as interesting to hear the other members and those like Alan Parsons, also involved with the project, and occasionally Waters, discuss the musical process, as well. <br /> <br />But those responsible for this film just did a lot more with what they had, as well, covering every track on the record and doing so in keeping with the sequencing it came with (both unlike the other titles in the series mentioned above), seamlessly editing together current playing by any member of the group and the original recordings (done only very occasionally on the other titles), and also providing a lot more -- another 30-40 minutes of bonus material, including full solo acoustic versions of multiple songs and all of it very worthwhile -- where none of the others provided any. The quality of the film is even better, and instead of the cheap-o digipack case, you get a regular plastic version.  <br /> <br />Indeed, the extra material is so good that one of the only questionable aspects of the work is why more of it wasn't included in the original film in the first place, or, if the makers were facing time constraints, why the DVD does not come with an option to play the film with the extra parts automatically included. But this isindeed being picky and in fact would not work in the case of the full song versions, given the other commentary going on and the editing done.  <br /> <br />In short, venture into the others at your own risk, but don't worry about plunking down the cost for this one, even if you're not a hard-core Floyd fan, as the results are well worth your money and time.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I first heard of the Strokes as a buzz band on mtv.Their first album was praised by critics and casual music fans alike. I didn't truly noticing them until \\"12:51\\" was released as a single and started rotating on K-ROQ(a southern California alt-rock radio station). I began to obsess with the song with its new wave synthesizers,clap-happy chorus,and its Tron inspired video.I raced to the video to buy the album and haven't stopped playing it since. As the the Ramones and the Sex Pistols before them,many of the bass and drum lines are similar, but don't feel repetitive because each song has a different feel.For example,\\"Reptilia\\" and \\"Automatic Stop\\" have similar riffs,but while \\"Reptilia\\" is done in a more crazy,out-of-control way,\\"Automatic Stop\\" has more of a laid-back feel to it.The CD starts off with a bang,with an instantly classic bass line and Julian Casablancas screaming into your ears with the tragically beautiful \\"What Ever Happened?\\" It is followed by \\"Reptilia\\",which I covered as an out-of-control song,but it is easily one of the best tracks on the CD.Overall,I feel that none of the tracks are skip-worthy, but there are strong tracks and weaker tracks.My top five songs on this album:  <br />                        <br />                     1.\\"12:51\\" <br />                     2.\\"Reptilia\\" <br />                     3.\\"What Ever Happened?\\" <br />                     4.\\"Meet Me In The Bathroom\\" <br />                     5.\\"Automatic Stop\\" <br />      This is easily one of the best albums of 2003,and anyone who likes music should pick this up.RIGHT.NOW.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This film is probably the first accurate depicture of what Christ went through.  I don't recall anyone producing a more accurate version of historical fact.  Over the years, scientists have worked to disprove the idea that Christ suffered for everyone's sins, that Noah built an arc, that the ten commandments actually existed.  But as the years have gone by, scientists are finally starting to locate the very artifacts that were discussed in the Bible.  Not to mention that the very cities and locations depicted in the Bible are not only real but you can travel to them and visit them today.    Anyone who says they don't believe that any of this is real is denying themselves the right to believe in historical fact that is backed by evidence, not only written testimony but also archeological findings.  I am extremely happy that Gibson put together this film, because in a society that is overrun by drugs, abuse, sex, etc., we need to bring back the very foundation that everything was founded upon.  We need to remind everyone that this is real, yes it exists, and if you feel guilty about it then ask yourself why.  Everyone should see this film.  That's all there is to it.  However, it could be too graphic for very young kids.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This is a movie you might actually want to see more than once, probably late on Saturday evenings. Great story and musical score.    Don't get hung up over the supposed superiority of the 1960 version. I've seen it and, unlike this film, have no desire to see it again. Cheesey can be fine, but it was much less believable and more than a little tedious.    This movie doesn't follow the book as closely; so what?  Consider it a different story and get over it. If you want the story in the book, read the book. It's still there and this movie hasn't affected it at all.  It stands on it's own.    There is a dialogue problem in this movie though, and at the penultimate intellectual moment to boot: the Morlock character at the end says \\" ... so we bred ourselves into castes ...\\"    Then, moments later, he says \\"Who are you to question 800,000 years ... of evolution?\\"    Of course, if they bred themselves into castes, that means they followed a planned (designed) course, so are indeed morally  responsible. Hardigan's criticism was justified (and the Morlock doesn't come across as being as brainy as they meant him to be).    Minor issue as far as enjoying the movie though.
B000286RKW|5.0|I can't heap any more well-deserved praise on this movie than has already been heaped. However, my peeve is reviewers who waste people's time writing about a DVD they haven't seen or about other movies they like better. Can't wait to see it? Great, me either. Sure it's going to be better than the last version? Well, we can all hope. Thought 'Ernest Goes To Jail' was better? Uh-huh. Think you should write a review of a DVD you haven't seen yet?    Uh.....NO.
0060512806|5.0|An interweaving of fact and fiction, from the beginnings of computing to the modern action novel. This is a complex read but a rewarding one if you are a student of the early days of codebreaking (hence, computing), action novels, and sheer interesting data. This book is the (perhaps) unintentional beginning of The Baroque Cycle and the character Enoch Root. Don't read this book if you demand, \\"Just the facts, Ma'am,\\" or, \\"Just the Sci-fi, Dude,\\" because Stephenson dwells on both sides of this strange road.
B000007492|4.0|Un album (best of) Supertramp, que je considre comme le meilleur du groupe. La voix du chanteur \\"Roger Hogdson\\" est mythique. Les mlodies sont harmonieuses, sublimes. <br /> <br />Absolutely Brilliant !!! <br />
B0001AP12G|4.0|I think 98 percent of mainstream American rap and r&b is rubbish, but I am very impressed by Kanye West. The production, the clever rhyme schemes, and a sense of humor that almost (almost) can reach Prince Paul like hilarity/absurdity all puts him beyond the pack of his peers. Nice to see someone rapping about more than drugs, pimps, hos and booze (though its all hear) <br /> <br />Some minor criticisms: <br />the pitched up soul samples show up a few too many places <br />checking talib kwelis name every 5 minutes <br />and i think it could potentially send the wrong message to black american kids about getting an education <br /> <br />but those are all minor. im very impressed
6305949980|5.0|When this movie was released ten years ago, it was moderately successful at the box office, but at least the critics loved it. I had no interest in this movie at the time. But when my dad rented it, I became a bit skeptical at first, but upon my first viewing, it was something I thought of as \\"weird,\\" but in a good way. The musical numbers were insanely addictive, and the storyline is one of a kind. And the stop-go animation... it seems dated now, but not with this movie. Forget the astonishing visuals of Disney/Pixar's movies (or for that matter, DreamWorks Animation), this movie is art and is still many times better than \\"Finding Nemo\\" or \\"Shrek.\\"    Now fast-forward to 2003. I didn't know of a DVD release until a friend of mine brought his and I asked if I could borrow it. Once I watched it, all I can think of was, \\"This movie is art.\\" I catch myself singing a few songs, become dazzled by its animation, and still get intrigued by its story. I just wonder to myself why I didn't appreciate this movie when it was first released. But my answer was that it didn't grab my attention. Kids don't really appreciate movies like this. I was one of them. Come the teen years, thoughts may get turned around, like what just happened to me. I can't praise the movie itself enough, this is art, people.    Now it gets the treatment it deserves: a Special Edition DVD packed with many extras like behind-the-scenes footage, making-of featurettes, and deleted scenes. It's an essential for Disney enthusiasts, but probably not intended for smaller children which may seem a bit scary at some parts.    What just ticks me off is how a lot of teenagers are just all of a sudden liking this movie. And I blame Hot Topic for turning this movie into a trend that has recently been forgotten (thank goodness). All that this movie stood for was lost during that time. Kids/teens didn't look at this movie as art. They just thought that if they wore a Jack Skellington shirt or sweater, they looked cool,or they tried to be a \\"social outcast.\\" Well, I'm glad that trend is dead (it just took one year for it to end) and now I can enjoy the movie in its prime and the way it was intended to be viewed: A visually beautiful musical that ranks up with Disney's great animated classics.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|This cd is just alright, I think I liked her first two much better.  This album was very over sexualized and a little raunchy.  Some of the tracks are nice, but I think she is trying to hard to become the next Madonna, and it just aint gonna happen Brit!  I do like Toxic, and the video was kinda cool.  I just don't know about this girl...  *sigh*  There may be hope for her if she uses her real voice instead of the helium-like little girl voice she uses...  Anyway... I don't think I'd recommend this cd...
074325144X|5.0|Still sore from the Hood to Coast, I watched my ChiRunning video last night, skimmed the book, and decided to put the basics into action during my morning run.  Wow!  ChiRunning seems nothing less than a total paradigm shift - transforming running from a \\"lower body activity\\" to an \\"upper body sport.\\"  A couple of analogies, to make sense of it:  a tennis serve doesn't get its pace from the arm muscles, nor does a swimmer's power come from the arms.      I switched back and forth on my run - between the old way, tensing my quads with each push off, and the new way, relaxing my legs, lifting my heels, trying to feel my core, and leaning.  It is -such- a difference.  For my first ChiRun, my time for five miles was on the slow end of normal, my HR was in the normal range, but the difference to my legs was off the charts.  I can't say it too strongly:  ChiRunning really is worth checking out.  (Caveat:  some of Danny's philosophies and ideas not directly related to the running mechanics ... I question.  E.g. hot tubbing after a run, but not eating.)    Happy trails!

B00005JMX6|5.0|Well done and at times even exceptional teen comedy.....I never understood how critics could review a teen comedy with the same eye they would review \\"The Hours\\" or \\"Cold Mountain. One must adjust ones expectations.<br /><br />This is what it is, a well done teen comedy and a nice DVD.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am a registered Republican and a moderate. It sickens me that many of my fellow Republicans condemned this movie without even seeing it, so I am giving it five stars for shaking up politics.  At least Moore has the courage to show us what the other side thinks and how they came to their conclusions.
0385512104|5.0|This book definitely deserves all the praises of the \\"5 stars reviews\\" before mine. Haddon has written a truly enriching and beautiful story. It is also unique because its narrator, Christopher, is unique. Christopher is not your typical hero. Yet he stands out and this autistic boy has definitely found a place in my heart. His views of his world is so different from the ordinary. Yet he may not be lacking in any way. Captivating and strangely touching, anyone who loves to read should have this book.
B0002EXFNI|4.0|If you want an educational or deeply moving experience, this is not the film you. But if what you are looking for is a couple of hours of lighthearted fun, this may be the perfect escape. Although the premise is, to say the least, not particularly plausible, the execution is well done.  As Johnny Carson used to say, if you buy the premise, you'll but the bit. Within the premise, the situations and the characters are well played, mesh well, and very believable.

They do, however, have many unique ways of gambling and finding out what kind of luck you have. I especially enjoyed the part where a prospective lucky man blindfolds himself and runs across a busy freeway at night to prove himself. <br /> <br />A few of the characters don't seem very believable. That is, the actors don't seem to relate to the characters they are playing. A few of the roles seemed rather hollow to me. <br /> <br />The action only ceased for a few dramatic pauses, and the ending was unique. I would share this one with all my friends. <br /> <br />And even my mom.

Confidential is a \\"guy thing,\\" a well-directed, fast-paced thriller with a Los Angeles atmospheric feel comparable to say \\"Chinatown\\" or \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\"  Director Curtis Hanson brings the fifties L.A. milieu to life with music, authentic appearing sets and a story that focuses on crime and corruption, false glamour and moral disillusionment as only the City of Angels could play it.  Things get a little bit comic book toward the end, but the characters and story and the rapid-fire one-liners will keep you glued to the screen.  There's a lot of  Raymond Chandler's L.A. here.<br /><br />\\"Confidential\\" was the name of an \\"expos&eacute;\\" magazine published in the fifties in the L.A. area.  I recall seeing it as a kid in liquor stores at some distance from the comic books.  It used green lettering on its first page (the only page I ever saw).  In this film the magazine is called \\"Hush-Hush,\\" and Danny DeVito is appropriately cast as its sleazy editor and publisher.<br /><br />Kim Basinger appears as a Veronica Lake look-a-like prostitute and plays it like Lauren Bacall from a Bogey film, but without comparable wit or grace.  James Cromwell is the personification of evil as the morally sick Capt Dudley Smith.  Russell Crowe as Bud White, the justice-dispensing cop with a brutal temper and a soft heart for battered dames, gives an excellent performance.  Guy Pearce as Ed Exley, the cop with glasses who doesn't care what the other cops think is also very good.  Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the cop whose thrill is to be part of the TV production \\"Badge of Honor\\" (that's the old \\"Dragnet\\" series with Jack Webb from the fifties), is also good.<br /><br />In short, the cast is excellent and is probably the main reason this classy \\"shoot 'em up\\" is so highly-rated.

B000002H2H|5.0|I believe that Ride the Lightning and And Justice for All are the best albums Metallica has put out. Justice does seem to have much longer songs with a little less thought in the lyrics, but the quality of the musical portion is thoroughly excellent. Fade to Black is by far hands-down my favorite Metallica song ever recorded. Buy the album for this one song and you will be pleased.

B00008G9JN|5.0|'Hunting Girl', the third track from this album, was the among the first JT songs I heard. A few years later, when I got my hands on the album, I finally understood the meaning of the term 'lush orchestration'. Brilliant right through, with nary a flaw anywhere. <br /> <br />The legendary Tull arrangement is right up there. Ian never sounded and played better, Martin simply rips his way through 'Hunting Girl' and 'Pibroch' (BTW, what a beautifully melancholy composition!). <br /> <br />Make no mistake, every track here is a killer, though I would recommend it for new fans only after they have heard a couple of the new JT albums. <br /> <br />Buy it anyway, and keep listening to it. One day, the meaning will dawn, clear as day!
B0002V7O3S|5.0|And a Great Story.  I am from Arizona, where this story takes place.   The movie is a little exagerrated when it comes to the Alien scenes, but nonetheless it is a great story about an area in the USA livid with UFO sitings.  Highly recommeneded!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I was planning on ordering the Star Wars Trilogy until I found out it is not the Star Wars Trilogy. It is more like a moderen remake of the old film. I would only buy the Star War movies that I saw back when they first came out. I remember reading about how ground breaking the films were at the time and could not wait to see them. I like, I am sure many others, watch older movies because we know ever piece of the film and enjoy waiting for each scene we know by heart. If the originals ever come out then and only then will I buy the Trilogy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll start by saying I am not a Joss Whedon fan-boy.  Like other reviewers, I came to this DVD set on a friend's recommendation and have not indulged in Buffy or Angel.  Also, I do not generally buy DVDs, especially those of TV shows (except the Simpsons, of course... I mean, come on...) <br /> <br />Anyway, after renting from Netflix, I'm buying this one. <br /> <br />I was blown away.   <br /> <br />The dialogue is fantastic, never cliched.  The writing credits your intelligence and attention span. <br /> <br />Malcolm Reynolds is what Han Solo should have been, and Nathan Fillion handles his subtleties with aplomb.  In fact, I don't see a weak character or weak actor in the bunch.  (Summer Glau's River Tam character does take time to develop... give her that time, and you'll be rewarded.) <br /> <br />Note to newbies: the two-hour pilot episode takes a while to get going.  Your interest will be piqued enough to watch the second episode, and after that, you'll be hooked. <br /> <br />Fox had a hit on their hands and BLEW IT. <br /> <br />Can't wait for the movie.  Let's hope the story doesn't end there.
0375703861|5.0|Yup! You read it here first. Mark my words... Zadie Smith has hit one out of the park with her very first novel.  It's quite extraordinary.  If she were a tech stock, her IPO would make eyes pop and records fall. Too bad, it's only a book. But, what a book! At least we can all share in it, celebrate her talent, and claim we followed her from the beginning.  And, what an auspicious beginning it is.      Oh? The plot?  Two unlikely wartime mates crisscross one another's lives over the years and traverse the human experience from their perspectives, as well as those of their kids, their wives,  their friends, and sundry other characters along the way.  Marvelously giddy ride all over the diverse English multicultural countryside. Like a maze that comes together toward the end, more or less. Great read - never a dull paragraph!    Enough said.  Now, buy the book!!

B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson took a big chance making this film and many even consider him a mad man now. It is brutal yes but I think Gibson just wanted viewers to feel Jesus' pain that he went through for us. He definetly succeeded in that. The film is also uplifting though during the flashback scenes of Jesus when he's not being brutally whipped. However they don't last that long and cut right back to him being tortured horribly. I'd say the moviemakes the people that whip and torture Jesus look the worse as they actually enjoy whipping and putting him through pain. They are clearly horrible men and do you feel terrible for Jesus for going through this brutal beating for us ? Yes. I mean no one would ever...ever want to go through what he did.<br /><br />  James Caviezel brings a great  warmth to the role and is his best performance period. When it comes to oscar time he shouldn't just be nominated...he should win. Gibson also does his best direction but the movie wouldn't have been as great if he didn't have such a talented actor playing Jesus. The film is brutal and painful to watch but in between all that it's also uplifting and powerful. It's a very important film and hey someone had to make it. It makes you appreciate Jesus a lot...if you don't already and if you do it makes you appreciate him and worship him a whole lot more.
B0002S94OS|5.0|With this album, Lamb of God secure their slot as leaders of modern metal, and on their forthcoming tour they will be headlining over established acts Fear Factory and Children of Bodom which is quite an accomplishment. Simply put this is probably their best release so far, but New American Gospel is right behind it. Lamb of God really didn't change their sound much but they certainly improved with better production, and non stop shredding with riffs galore, and as always brutal breakdowns that make you want to punch the floor and jump in the pit. My favorite LoG song of all time is on here, \\"Now you've got something to die for\\". Other good songs are \\"What I've Become\\" and \\"Laid to Rest\\", but what am I saying people? This is a Lamb of God album, every song is simply amazing. If you like Lamb of God I highly recommend these other amazing bands: Chimaira, On Broken Wings, Throwdown, Devildriver, Darkest Hour, Unearth, Terror, etc.
B000001DYD|5.0|This album begins with menacing plucking, then Polly's fragile vocals begin to arrive, on the attack. <br />And as they brood and build up to something unsure, as you begin to wonder, and explosion of her wounded brutality assaults your speakers and renders you unable to do anything but listen to the rest of the album, troubled, yet enthralled. <br />As her angst oozes on tracks like \\"Man Size\\", and a playful sense of rage bounces along \\"50 Ft. Queenie\\", one is struck by how well her music captures the kinds of nervous voices and messages of conflict, which seem to pop into our heads during a time when we are unspeakably nervous/under fire. <br />What P.J. Harvey has done is brought the troubled voices of conciousness out into the venue of full-on expression, a way to attack them, and to display them in such a way that the audience realizes that their raging panic is of the same primal nature. <br />The guitars bruise, slide, screech and hiss to accompany Polly Jean Harvey's devestated cries, all the way from the agony of the opener, through the tumultuous rants scattered through the middle, to a strange kind of deathlike \\"Ecstasy\\" at the end. <br />You'll wanna hang onto this one.
1400034779|5.0|A cousin gave me this book for my birthday 2 years ago. At the time, I thought, hmm, not my cup of tea and I put it on my shelf and forgot about it. Last weekend however, en route to the pool, I was looking for something to read, so I picked it up and started to read it. WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE! I so enjoyed this book, I read it in a day. I am originally South African so for me it had that extra dimension of home. Precious is a wonderful character and she really comes to life, as do the other characters. The author captures Africa beautifully and left me feeling really homesick. I just finished the second edition and loved it too, and just bought the next two!  I cannot recommend these books highly enough - I am also really pleased to see that non-African audiences have loved the book - I would have thought that it would not appeal to Americans, but I'm glad I was wrong.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This album is so addicting.  I cannot stop listening to it.  It reminds me of early U2 but a lot of similarities with The Talking Heads too.  It definitely has an 80s pop rock feel.  The songs are well written, and the guitarists are talented.  This album is just so much fun to listen to.  I highly recommend it if you like 80s pop rock and are looking for something new and good to listen to.
B00008DZ0H|5.0|No doubt this is my favorite White Stripes album of all time! None of their albums since this one have been able to capture that same grungy garage band intensity. Every track explodes with a raw energy that is rarely heard from in contemporary bands. From the first track \\"Jimmy The Exploder\\" I was hooked. Their awesome rendition of \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" would make Robert Johnson downright proud. In fact, many of the songs on the album are old blues covers but updated beautifully. Jack White's heavily distorted slide guitar playing skills have few peers. The only acoustic song on the album is a track called \\"Sugar Never Tasted So Good,\\" which sounds like something from Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffitti album. I could go on and on about why you must own this CD but I won't at risk of sounding like a fanboy. The reason I'm reviewing the Japanese version in particular is because it comes with two additional tracks that weren't available on the American release (Let's Shake Hands & Lafayette Blues). Both of these tracks are amazing and were only previously available as singles. With all of the other tracks, in addition to these two extra tracks, I humbly believe this is one of the best rock 'n' roll/blues albums ever made.

I was so happy that I got it.  I have read some reviews saying it had some bad material.  I guess if you are under 10 I could agree with this,  but for everyone else this is a must read.  I didn't even particularly like sci-fi books untill I read this.  For some other great sci-fi books read The City of Ember and The people of Sparks (which is a sequal to The City of Ember.)

B000001A9P|5.0|For anyone that is a fan of Stevie Wonder, this CD is one you must have. It is absolutely fantastic. All the tracks are live recordings with the best acoustic sound. I'm not sure which year this was recorded but this CD makes it obvious that Stevie has been doing this for many years because this is the closest to perfection. All classic songs, I listen to these CDs from beginning to end and then put in another one of his albums because this album makes me wish it will never end. Don't take my word for it, listen for yourself. You will not be disappointed
B00028HBKM|4.0|The Passion of the Christ depicts the last twelve hours before his crucifixion and death.  But what about some of the stuff before that?  Fortunately, there are multiple flashbacks so that it can cover a little more ground. <br /> <br />The movie begins with haunting music together with dark and cool color themes (color themes are used often in the movie).  At night, a bright blue moon with thick layers of mist on the dark garden, appropriately matching the given scene of Gethsemane.  With all the dialogue in Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin (don't worry; there are English subtitles) and the ethereal music, there is an intensely artistically feel throughout the movie, to the extent it is somewhat difficult for one to enjoy or dislike the movie in any conventional sense.  Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing the film, on par with his Oscar winning movie Braveheart.  Gibson, I think, has earned at least a nomination with this film. <br /> <br />The depth of the character of Jesus is developed more fully than most movies on the life of Christ and greatly emphasizes his humanity.  Here we see Jesus not just a stoic and solemn teacher, but also facets of definite fear and reluctance in the sacrifice he is called to make for humanity, and not wanting the other disciples (only three were with him at the scene at Gethsemane) to see him like this.  Flashbacks later show him in lighthearted moods of cheerfulness and even playfulness.  Jesus really does come across as very human character, even though the divine aspect is not neglected in the film. <br /> <br />What about historical accuracy?  I'll mention a few points here.  Pontius Pilate is plausibly portrayed.  If he does not execute Jesus, he fears a rebellion from Caiphas.  But if he does execute Jesus, he fears that Jesus' followers may start a rebellion.  Either way, he fears that we will get in trouble with Caesar (a rebellion would not make Pilate look in control of the region) and thus tries to walk a tightrope somewhere in between.  This is reasonable since in 31 C.E. Pilate's protector/patron Sejanus fell from power because he was plotting against the emperor.  This would have made Pilate's position very weak in 33 C.E. (the date Jesus was probably crucified), so it's quite reasonable that he would have been unusually careful to prevent getting into further trouble with Caesar.  The crucifixion however is less realistic however.  Jesus would most likely have been nailed at the wrists, not in the palms as we see in some traditional paintings. <br /> <br />For those of you wanting their kids to see this movie, I should remind you that it is rated R for a very good reason.  The violence is brutally realistic when Jesus is scourged.  When it's all done, there appear to be hundreds of bloody lacerations all over his body.  And on top of this there is of course the crown of thorns and being nailed to the cross. <br /> <br />I would be remiss in my review if I did not say something about the anti-Semitism that supposedly exists in this film. There are a couple of problems with this charge.  One, it was by far the Roman gentiles-not the Jews-who were the most vicious, sardonic and sadistic people in the movie. <br /> <br />Second there is the crucial question: were the Jews portrayed in a negative light?  An oversimplified \\"yes\\" would hardly do the matter justice.  Yes, some Jews were-but many were not.  By mentioning only the instances of a negative portrayal of Jews, some critics make the movie seem a lot more one-sided than it really is.   <br /> <br />So what are the favorable portrayals of Jews?  There is of course the fact that the protagonist and his most loyal followers were Jewish (a fact often overlooked by Anti-Semites who call themselves Christians).  The Jewishness of the women followers was particularly emphasized with some brief Passover dialogue.  Additionally, Mel Gibson went \\"out of his way\\" (included material not in the gospels) to show that these Jewish enemies ofJesus were not representative of all Jews.  For instance, the movie showed a dissenting member of the Sanhedrin.  \\"Who called the meeting anyway?  And at this hour of the night?  Where are the other members of the council?\\"  As the crowd pushed him out of the meeting, the Jewish priest denounced the whole meeting as a \\"beastly travesty!\\"  Furthermore, the movie made it most explicitly clear that Simon of Cyrene was a Jew, and he was ultimately seen as a compassionate man, very sympathetic towards the suffering of Jesus.  This Jewish man who was not a follower of Jesus was actually more virtuous than any of the gentiles in the movie. <br /> <br />Any unfavorable aspects of the DVD?  Unfortunately, yes.  Probably the most disappointing aspect of this DVD is the complete lack of any special features.  On the main menu, there are only the options of playing the film in addition to the language and scene selections.  (Though there is a nice feature for the visually impaired.)  Granted, given the seriousness of the matter, humorous outtakes might not have been appropriate.  But even still, something like a little director commentary would have been nice.  Overall however, this is still a DVD that one should have if one wants a reasonably comprehensive video library.  The movie will likely be remembered and watched several generations long after we're dead. <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|A movie so graphically brutal that it achieves a primal disgust unparalleled in movie history. For that, and for showcasing the power of cinema, and for the entertainment value, this movie gets 5 stars. <br /> <br />There is a mystic quality that moves throughout the movie... The role of Jesus is played beautifully. One can't help but feel pity for Jesus, but the editorial review's claim that even non-believers may feel culpable is nonsense. Non-believers, however, may feel amused that many will consider this movie a representation of history, as if the Christian Bible is an accurate account. Also, it is highly unlikely that anyone will be conned into thinking that Jesus physically suffered enough to bear the sins of a potentially infinite number of believers, though enough maybe to bear the sins of say 2-3 protestants that were burned alive. I also didn't think the movie comes off as anti-Semitic to someone who does not have much knowledge of Judeo-Christian history. <br /> <br />Though it is a fine piece of art, the movie is as unconvincing as the irrational Bible-pushers in the proposition that Yeshu was a Christ and he suffered for our sins, and that blind belief in him is fair game for a god that will send believers to heaven and the rest of us to hell and that too for an infinite time for finite sins. But then, I doubt if Gibson seriously wanted to convert non-blind-believers; he wanted to pay a tribute to his god, and he has done that well.

B000002I97|5.0|I am a member of the \\"Phish Club\\" of music--brilliant, diverse music usually.  I've been listening to the Prine albums since I was born due to my parents having, say, this album way back in '71, when I was a fat little one-year-old.  BURNED OUT tens of these on my close-'n'-play. AND \\"Sweet Revenge\\" too.  John Prine was a mailman in Maywood, IL, the town next to mine, which is mostly a scary crack parlor these days.  His songs would have probably been QUITE different if he was a mailman these days.  My Mom and her friends thought he was \\"cute as hell\\" when seeing him strum at local gigs.  So I must admit I'm biased. But, hell, now that I listen to the same album with 35 years undur my belt...my god.  At 24, he was a songwriting genius (nothing less), a lyrical master of the highest order, and had lots of friends in good places (like the classic Steve Goodman--RIP Steve my man).  BUY THIS even if you JUST want it to hear an admitted huge influence of Trey Anastasio, Willy Nelson, and TONS of other country-rock-folk musicians.  Its incredible. Luckily its a block in the foundation of my 35-year-old musical \\"house of Ron.\\"  Even if you aren't a fan of Anastasio--BUY THIS ALBUM.  Its better than anything Dylan could have ever dreamed of doing.  It's THAT fundimental, and THAT good.  Remember also that this came from a 24 YEAR OLD KID and you can't help be amazed as hell... <br /> <br />A #3 in my top 5 albums of all time. <br /> <br />Ron
1401201911|4.0|It's not often that you find a comic book with critics' reviews quoted on the back. Right there that means one of two things: that this is a better-than-average comic book, or DC is trying ^way^ too hard. <br /> <br />Fortunitely for my attention span, it's the first. This comic book is good -- no, great. It's only when you take him out of his original setting that you find out what made Superman American, and more intriguingly, what still makes Superman Superman. His dance with Wonder Woman is beautifully surreal -- he wears the uniform of a human, yet makes no effort to hide what he is and they're both actually floating off the ground. <br /> <br />I found that the biggest question \\"Red Son\\" raised was, \\"Would Communism have worked if the Russians had Superman to run it?\\" Statistically it does work, but somewhere along the line, Superman the Moralist becomes Big Brother, and the \\"Superman Robots\\" are disturbing! Of course, it all makes sense -- power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  <br /> <br />And then the entire thing ends in a quasi Jennifer Paradox. Joy. <br /> <br />Strongly reccommended for anyone who likes escapist literature and wants to stretch the imagination.
B0002CTSVS|5.0|I don't actually own the DVD yet but I have seen the movie in the theatre I must say it is well worth buying this DVD. The movie is well filmed with excellent graphics. It is the most graphically modern movie of Jesus Christ's crucifixion to date. If you can't handle bloody movies this one isn't for you but for anyone who can stomach graphic images this is a good movie to see. I hope Mel plans on doing the sequel!
B00028HBKC|5.0|This film had an impact on me like no other. I was literally shaken. I try to live as a devout Catholic Christian, but this book brought home the seriousness of Jesus Christ's mission like nothing previous, with the possible exception of the superb translation of the Gospels in the New American Bible (Catholic). The demonic forces as portrayed by Gibson represent a reality that is foreign to modern sensibilites, but nonetheless real. We ignore this at our peril.<br /><br />Is the film Anti-Semitic? Hardly, and saying so is a red herring that could distract attention from the real issues. Jew or Greek, we all have a common humanity, a common sinfulness, and common (supernatural) enemies. Recall that the first leaders of the Christian Church were virtually all Jews.<br /><br />Say Gibson, how about a sequel on the Acts of the Apostles to Revelation? Give it lots of love and really pull out the stops when John takes his nap on Patmos. This could be a welcome antidote to Left Behind mania.
0679720200|5.0|I love this book! <br />Well-developed characters and an underlying unanswered question take you on a ride you won't soon forget. <br />I really appreciated the visual imagery as well. Camus allows the reader to see, taste, and feel what is happening. <br />Now don't let my gushiness make you think this is a breezy beach read. It isn't. It is profound. It deals with man's greatest sin...lose (or the absence) of soul. <br />
B00028HBKM|4.0|My wife and I saw this movie in the theaters back in Feb., and I've been waiting for the dvd release every since.  I don't consider my self much of a christian, but I was very moved by this movie.  I found myself coming to tears, and my wife was crying quite a bit.  It's one of those movies that just do something to you, touches you in a way that most movies don't.  We watched it at the theaters on a Sat. night, and I bet I didn't get to sleep until 2 in the morning, I just sat up and thought, and thought, and thought about it.  I actually got on the internet, and did some research about the life of Christ, and finally understood some of the deeper meanings of christian faith.  So like the millions of other people today, I went out and bought the dvd.  But beware, there are absolutely no special features on it.  I guess like everyone else, we'll have to wait for the special edition.  I do recommend people to buy it though, it will touch you in one way or the other, it's impossible not to be moved.

B000056NX4|5.0|As far as musicals go, I am as enthusiastic and open to new versions as they come. But when I saw that this version on Jesus Christ Superstar (JCS) was set on a stage, i was very weary about it. Also, being a traditionalist (even thought im only 16), I was drawn away by the \\"modernism\\" of the Webber classic. But, I as soon as \\"Heaven on their minds broke into its tell-tale rythmic explosion, i knew it was an istant masterpiece.  Comparitively to the original, this version of JCS, has superior acting and singing engrosed within all of its players. Plus, the addition of brittish comedian \\"Drop Dead Fred\\" as King Herod made \\"King of the Jews\\" one of the many memorable numbers. Also, Glenn Carter plays one of the most empowering, yet heart wrenching roles in musical history as he plays the lead as Jesus. And No other actor could have played it better.    All in all, JCS is simply stunning, Breathtakeing, and a marvel of modern musicals that should be mirrored in others.      five out of five stars. <br />-if you want to reach me, feel free to email me at mr_014@hotmail.com-
B000002BFZ|5.0|I know good music. Pearl Jam is my favorite band of all time (obviously) and I obsess over every single one of their albums... No Code is not an exception. I, personally, like ALL of the tracks on this album, with a few standouts and a few \\"experimental mishaps\\", shall we say.... <br />Anyway, on to the tracks! <br /> <br />Sometimes- This is one of the quirkiest PJ songs I've ever heard... I love it, though.. Ed's vocals seem to strain on the chorus, which, in my opinion, makes it sound pretty cool. Great song, although not one of my faves. 8/10 <br />Hail, Hail- As another reviewer said... Heavy stuff! I love it.. This was the song on the album that really \\"caught my ear\\", if you know what i mean... I recently went on a shopping spree and splurged on every PJ album I could afford, thus completing my collection of PJ studio albums, and at first, like many, I wasn't too keen on No Code... But I listened to Hail, Hail a couple of times and it really got me to listen... 9/10 <br />Who You Are- Though I wasn't old enough to consciously analyze music in '96, my mother kindly let me know that this was the first single off No Code... I've heard that it turned off many \\"fans\\" of PJ... I can't see any way in hell that this would turn listeners off.. It's just a plain cool song, with an awesome tribal sound. 7.5/10 <br />In My Tree- One of the only PJ singles (excluding those on Ten and \\"Corduroy\\" from Vitalogy) that actually blows me away.. It's just a pretty song! Great tribal beat, once again... 8/10 <br />Smile- Very bluesy. One of my favorite tracks on the album.. I love the harmonica and Ed's ominously calm vocals in the beginning... Great chorus, too. 9/10 <br />Off He Goes- Man, I love this song. It's so beautiful, and Ed's vocals are amazing... Have you read the lyrics? I suggest you do. Great... I listen to a lot of later Zeppelin, so I'm used to long songs... The length doesn't bother me one bit- Even if it did, the song is just too good to bore anyone. 9/10 <br />Habit- Now this one is HEAVY. Forget what I said about Hail, Hail... it pales in comparison to the intensity of Habit... It almost makes you want to cover your ears, its so heavy.. But you can't possibly cover them... Because it's so GOOD. 8/10 <br />Red Mosquito- My FAVORITE SONG on the album- possibly off of any PJ album... I LOVE this song. It's got an awesome bluesy melody- towards the end, it starts to give me CHILLS, it's so good. Nuff Said. Perfect. 11/10 <br />Lukin- Not much to say.. One minute long. Fast, raucious punk. I love it! 9/10 <br />Present Tense- Lukin was a great seguey into this one... It gives you a breath of fresh air from the last minute, haha... It's a very pretty song, and the lyrics are awesome. 8/10 <br />Mankind- Despite some reviewers comments about Ed's vocal superiority to Stone's, I love his voice.. Mind, of course, I WORSHIP Ed's voice, But I think Stone's got a calming, pleasant voice. Very good song. 8.5/10 <br />I'm Open- WHY DOESN'T ANYONE LIKE THIS SONG? Seriously! I love it! It's artsy, it's out there, it's creative... A couple days ago my friend and I went outside with my guitar and shouted political obscenities at all of the cars that passed by... It reminds me of one of those days.. I love it! 10/10 <br />Around the Bend- give this one a listen. It's a beautiful song, although not as memorable as a few of the other tracks. 8/10 <br /> <br />So yes, overall, this is an amazing album... If you're going to buy a FIRST PJ album, make it Riot Act or Ten... Once you get more into them, though, No Code will be a favorite. :) <br />Thanks! <br /> <br />

B000003TAR|5.0|\\"Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old,\\" sings Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain at the top of \\"Serve The Servants,\\" the very first song on what would turn out to be Nirvana's very last album, 1993's \\"In Utero.\\" And so begins the final chapter for one of rock's most important bands. As you listen to the various tortured lyrics on \\"In Utero,\\" it becomes very clear that all is not well with Cobain, and that the pressures of fame and fortune were crushing him. Still, Cobain bravely hung in there for one last album, one last musical statement to the world before he sadly & tragically succumbed to his inner demons the following year. But what a final musical statement \\"In Utero\\" is. Although the album is both angry and aggressive, it is also melodic and very beautiful. Cobain, bassist Krist Noveselic and drummer Dave Grohl wanted to step away from the studio polish of their 1991 smash, \\"Nevermind,\\" and make the follow-up album sound a lot more raw and uncompromising. Mind you, this in no way puts down \\"Nevermind\\": that album is an all-time classic. But Cobain & company suspected that \\"Nevermind\\" was the megahit that it was partially due to the studio gloss that producer Butch Vig added to it. For \\"In Utero,\\" the band brought in Steve Albini to give the album a raw, in-your-face, take-no-prisoners feel. And it works brilliantly. \\"Nevermind\\" may be the album Nirvana will always be best known for, but \\"In Utero\\" is the album that, all things considered, is truest to the spirit of the band. The powerful force and lyrics of such songs as \\"Serve The Servants,\\" \\"Heart-Shaped Box,\\" \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"Pennyroyal Tea,\\" the band's mindblowing, aggressive attack on \\"Scentless Apprentice,\\" \\"Milk It,\\" \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter,\\" and the brief, punk screamfest that is \\"Tourette's,\\" mixed with the quiet, poignant beauty of \\"Dumb\\" and the album's final, haunting song, \\"All Apologies,\\" make \\"In Utero\\" a truly towering rock album. Cobain's singing, screaming, guitar-playing and songwriting are brilliantly powerful, Noveselic's bass is a big booming monster, and Grohl's forceful drum smashing will blow the doors off you.Nirvana--and Kurt Cobain--flamed out much too soon. We can only wonder how much great music has been lost, but we can take comfort in the band's music that remains: three studio albums, a rarities collection, a live album, a best-of, and the legendary \\"MTV Unplugged\\" performance. As the band's final studio album, \\"In Utero\\" is an outstanding farewell to Nirvana, a truly original, truly great band.ongwriting are brilliantly powerful, Noveselic's bass is a big booming monster, and Grohl's forceful drum smashing will blow the doors off you.Nirvana--and Kurt Cobain--flamed out much too soon.

B000000H7I|5.0|One word to describe Suffocation, MINDBLOWING. The musicianship from these guys is just incredible. Effigy Of The Forgotton is one sick album. The brutal guitar riffs just tear you to pieces, the fast rapid drumming just pound you straight to the ground, and of course the gutteral vocals will eat you alive. If you're into some brutal technical headbanging death metal, this album is yours. Suffocation Rules!

B00028HBKM|2.0|This is a film that I cannot even recommend to my elderly, born-again Christian grandparents.  I have lost respect for Mel Gibson after being subjected to the abusive violence in this slasher film.  But I suppose this is the product of a kooky director with too much time on his hands. <br /> <br />I will give this movie 2 stars only becuase the cinematography is beautiful, the acting superb and the setting/costumes were perfect. <br /> <br />The content of the film is horrible.  Stick with the Biblical version and you can't go wrong. <br /> <br />Oh & Jim Cavaziel is hot.
6300214826|5.0|Of course this is a fantastic film.No other comments are needed. It is perfect. I would like to comment on one of the reviewers with his meaning for the word apocalypse, by telling us that it represents \\"the end\\". Well, this is not the case, and this is what it is all about. Apocalypse means revelation, and in one of the internet dictionaries I found a beautiful definition to what happened to Colonel Kurtz: \\"something revealed, especially a dramatic disclosure of something not previuosly known or realized\\". I see Apocalyse Now as a shock of deep internal beliefs with reality. Colonel Kurtz is not really a renegade: he is just turn insane by the revelation, the apocalypse.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I remember that when An Officer and a Gentleman first came to the big screen, people were raving over Louis Gossett, Jr.'s portrayal of a drill sergeant. And no doubt about it, he was quite good at the time, but nothing can compare to R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman. His actual experience in breaking Marine recruits gave him a wealth of quips, putdowns, and insults to work with, much of which Kubrick added to the script. Indeed, most of the enjoyment I got the first few times I viewed Full Metal Jacket was listening to Ermey's browbeating his recruits--the man could make bikers blush!<br /><br />But over time, I've come to appreciate other elements in the film, most noticeably the break in the middle when the film goes from Parris Island to Viet Nam. At first, it seemed a little disjointed, almost as if two movies were made with little in common between them. However, as I looked closer, I began to realize that Kubrick's subject is not Viet Nam, the USMC, or even war in general. Instead, he goes straight to the subject of brutality and how it dehumanizes people. And instead of complaining about it, Kubrick seems to suggest that the dehumanizing effect is something to be thankful for. How else could these characters cope?<br /><br />Yet the really amazing thing about Full Metal Jacket is how much it grows on me with each viewing. I see similarities between the two sections, from the rigidly organized cruelty of boot camp to the chaotic lawlessness of Viet Nam. The same grotesque violence exists in both places; the parallel consequences are eerily similar. Kubrick does himself a great service by not trying to make a film which sums up all of Viet Nam. Instead, he limits his scope to just a few \\"days in the life.\\" Our attention is not on the enemy (who is all but absent), the war (which quickly seems besides the point), or the controversy (which is barely hinted at). Instead, the film makes us look inward. It's disturbing, it's gruesome, and it's funny in the most irreverent ways. But it's the only way it could have been made.verent ways. But it's the only way it could have been made.

This movie is great and the added commentary makes it even better. I recommend it highly.

B0000648WZ|4.0|Somehow this movie got homologated, my guess is that it had enough pretty faces, nudity, violence, gore and corny acting--something film execs are loath to pass up. <br /> <br />Too bad for them that this is one of the most intelligent films ever made about the schema of society and politics colliding into fascism.  Basically, by the end of the film you're subconsciouly supposed to be thinking, \\"Democracy is actually facism.\\"   <br /> <br />But nevermind that:  We, the humans, live in a peaceful, perfect, blonde-haired world where democracy has failed, a sort of military-style facism is in place and we all seem to be the better for it.  However, an alien race of uglies called Arachnids (nicknamed Bugs) keep hurtling asteroids at Earth.  When one collides in South America and kills lots of people, war were declared.  So off go the soap-opera kiddies to space boot-camp, where the word \\"Sir!\\" is said almost as many times as \\"Medic!\\"  They all graduate, for better or for worse, and get sent off to the army, where they are woefully unprepared for the truth; that the battle is darn-near hopeless. <br /> <br />However, they don't seem to mind at all, so long as they can be made squad-leader, or take out at least a few Bugs along the way.  Nevermind that almost every mission is a failure; these kids really like what they're doing!  For example, the main protagonist is a vessel of valiance named Rico.  In one particular mission, he uses his Aryan-borne stealth to destroy a particularily nasty bug.  Covered in orange goo, his C.O. informs him that he's just been promoted.  The other soldiers gather around him, gushing, like he's just won prom-king.   <br /> <br />So the movie goes!  The great thing about these actors is that they're so effusive they almost realize their own parody.  They graduate from high school, and yet the army and the war are just an extension of their cliques and innocence, no matter how many deaths are amassed.  When it's time for a new batch of soldiers to be brought in, Rico observes how young they are.  Oh sure, and I'm sure the mirror just makes you look older. <br /> <br />In the meantime, there's a commentary track on this disc with Verhoeven and others that's both revealing and fun to listen to, especially when Verhoeven recreates the sounds he made to make his actors believe the CG bugs were there.  The bonus disc is also full of everything you'd ever want to know about the making, dutifully earning the name \\"Bonus.\\" <br /> <br />So does the stuff of the socio-politico level actually work?  Eh, not really.  But who cares!  The performances are so enjoyable; see what happens to a sci-fi movie when suddenly everyone takes themselves too seriously, and the humans really don't have a prayer...
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Legendary producer/engineer Alan Parsons has re-emerged with \\"A Vital Path\\", his first project since 1999's \\"Time Machine\\". For this album, we find Parsons working with an entirely new set of musicians alongside some very special guests performances from David Gilmour, John Cleese and some of today's emerging dance music artists. While Techno, Trance and Dance music have never been closely associated with Alan Parsons, he succeeds to the fullest bringing the genre into his own music with this album. The overall sound is mostly electronic relying on programmed drum loops, sequencers and textured synthetic orchestrations.<br /><br /> The five instrumental tracks vary in sound and texture but create a cohesive mood throughout the album. \\"Return to Tunguska\\" has a slight modern Tangerine Dream feel to it and features some stellar lead and slide guitar work from David Gilmour. The updated version of Parsons 1982 classic \\"Mammagamma\\" improves on the original with it's uptempo dance grooves, techno sequences and keyboard atmospheres. Parsons son Jeremy does an fabulous job with the reconstruction of this piece. \\"Tijuanic\\" and \\"L'arc en Ciel\\" are linked together and both feature a style similar to that of Jean-Michel Jarre. The latter track features guitarist Alistair Greene delivering some very Pink Floyd-inspired lead guitar (too bad Gilmour didn't guest on this track too). The closing instrumental \\"Chomolungma\\" is another Jeremy Parsons collaboration featuring a driving rhythm sequence, processed chanted vocals and an oriental-style synth lead. The piece closes with a dynamic climax which caps itself off with John Cleese's humorous dialog and a dog barking.<br /><br />Between these five instrumental highlights are four more traditional vocal pieces. \\"More Lost Without You\\" features vocalist PJ Ollson and is a straight-forward guitar rock song. \\"We Play The Game\\" displays the dance-oriented sound heard in the instrumental pieces but welds it with a vintage style of Alan Parsons' classic heyday. Alan himself handles the vocals on this track sounding uncanningly like his former coleague Eric Woolfson and also plays most of the instruments as well. Alan also handles the vocals on \\"A Recurring Dream Within A Dream\\" (an updated reworking of \\"The Raven\\" from Parsons debut 'project' \\"Tales Of Mystery and Imagination\\"). Unlike the previous track, Parsons vocals are processed through a vocoder. The overall style is fluid and not as aggressive as the original version. The final vocal track is \\"You can Run\\", a driving rock piece featuring David Pack on guitar and vocals. Pack's vocal delivery is slightly different than his work with Ambrosia or his past work with Parsons. Still, it is an interesting track that shows off another unique side to Parsons.<br /><br />With all this said, there is no doubt that \\"A Valid Path\\" is Alan Parsons finest album in over a decade. This is an overall solid album from beginning to end and shows Alan not afraid to tackle new musical risks and challenges. He definitely handles the electronic genre with greatness here. Like always, his production and engineering talents are flawless. After being in the business for over 35 years, Alan Parsons has still proven to be vaild with \\"A Valid Path\\".<br /><br />A Masterwork for the 21st Century!!lassic heyday.

B0002S94OS|3.0|It really deserves 3.5 stars actually. I will give LOG props for keeping true and still staying heavy as hell. But honestly this record was rushed and does not display this bands full potential. How much can a band possibly grow in 1 year?! Not really much! There are a couple of bad ass songs here but as a whole it falls kind of flat on its face. The one bright side is that the production is killer! But even amazing production can not cover up repetition. Boys and girls spend your hard earned cash on the new MASTODON instead.
0783231202|4.0|regardless of historical accuracy, the film still gives vivid insight into the life of a captured slave. i also thought the film was fairly entertaining. and as for the remarks made by Octavius, first of all, the abolitionist movement was well underway in the 1840s, the kkk was NOT formed in Connecticut, it was formed in Pulaski,Tennessee as a social club by a group of confederate army veterans. i suggest you take a U.S. history course before making such claims in the future Octavius.

B0002I831S|4.0|After watching the downward trajectory (IMHO) of the Star Trek empire (Nemesis and Enterprise), I felt I wanted to support the parts that keep me in.  (ie. New Frontier book series by Peter David)<br /><br />DVD-wise since I'm not rich enough to buy DS9 or TNG DVD collection, I broke down and bought this set and will probably buy the remaining 2 sets.  It was seeing old friends with their familiar jibes and quirks.  The episodes are presented 4 per DVD in the order they were shown on TV (unlike what some other poster said).  The picture is decent but there are episode gems like \\"City on the Edge of Forever\\" and \\"Menagerie\\" that made it worthwhile to get this 38 year old TV set.<br /><br />But as I watch, thoughts of GalaxyQuest keep creepin in..<br /><br />The new featurettes are amusing but feel alittle flat especially the Shatner one where he just goes on and on and on about his horses.  The cast interviews are done in isolation.  I guess they can't hang out together anymore.<br /><br />I dock this one star for not having the cast members provide commentary for the episodes.  At least, one episode?  They don't even have to do the same one!  Favorite ep or something.  Come on!  With \\"Bones\\" and \\"Scotty\\" (essentially) gone, this would be an ideal time to immortalize.<br /><br />Unless they are saving those in the vault until the 40th anniversary.<br /><br />Hmm.  Maybe they should since they haven't been producing much good lately!
B000096IBI|5.0|The 1930s saw Charlie Chaplin appear in only two motions pictures, both of them silent, and both of them brilliant:  CITY LIGHTS and MODERN TIMES.  The latter is many things:  the last major silent film to come out of Hollywood, the final film to feature the Little Tramp, and the first film to feature Chaplin's voice, albeit only in song.  It is also Chaplin's last truly great film, though THE GREAT DICTATOR and even MONSEIUR VERDOUX had some marvelous moments.  Although sound film had emerged from its infancy to reach full maturity by 1936, the things that Chaplin is able to do almost makes one regret the demise of the silent film.<br /><br />Chaplin is so spry and active in this film that one can scarcely credit that he is 47 years old.  In scene after scene he demonstrates his utter mastery of his own body, skating as brilliantly as he has in any of a number of shorts in the first years of his stardom, or as graceful as any ballet dancer skipping along an assembly line, squirting his coworkers with oil out of a can.  Apart from perhaps Fred Astaire, was there ever a more graceful performer than Chaplin?  His fellow silent star Buster Keaton was perhaps more purely athletic, but his was the physical prowess of the stunt man, while Chaplin's was that of the imp.<br /><br />Unlike Keaton, who too often tended to have actresses far beneath his skills, Chaplin loved to have strong actresses with him.  This one, Paulette Goddard he married (though she was later unable to present a wedding certificate).  Fascinatingly, given Chaplin's legendary attraction to very young girls, teenagers even, Goddard's character, according to the credits \\"A Gamin,\\" was a minor.  That, and a host of somewhat risqu&eacute; jokes early in the film, make one surprised that it managed to pass muster with the Hays office.<br /><br />The official Amazon reviewer states that this is Chaplin's satire of the mechanical world, but that it not quite correct.  It is true that in his films as a whole Chaplin never is at ease with machines the way that Keaton was in his (Keaton's two greatest films, THE GENERAL and THE NAVIGATOR, feature a steam train and a steam ship more or less as costars), this film is not focused as a whole on machines.  The target is, instead, the world of capitalism, specifically, the plight of the proletarian.  The Little Tramp is inept as a wage earner in a time that demands that one either be a wage owner or a wage payer, or else be unemployed and therefore unfed.  Many of his struggles in the film have nothing to do with machinery or mechanization.  Only near the end, when he briefly appears to have a gift for art, is he able to achieve anything even remotely approaching competence in his job.  The anti-capitalist themes are so blatant in the film (indeed, in the first frames, which show first a herd of sheep and then a group of workers entering a factory) that the film indirectly led to Chaplin's exile from the United States in 1952, when he left the country partly because of accusations of tax evasion and partly because of accusations of having been a Communist.  He was not the latter, but he was unquestionably something of a naive politics (by that I mean that Chaplin's political ideas were not deeply articulated, though their tendency was unmistakable).<br /><br />I can't emphasize enough how superbly the picture looks in this film.  The picture is sharp and crisp, with absolutely no hint of a worn print.  The way we see it here is as good as it has ever looked.  The musical score, which was composed by Chaplin, is marvelous, culminating in his most famous composition the exquisite \\"Smile.\\"<br /><br />Although Chaplin contemplated a different ending, the one we have is as perfect as can be imagined.  Chaplin and Goddard, escaped from the officers who want to return her to a juvenile home, prepare to go down the road together.  She looks downcast, but he cheers her and looking at her very clearly says to her, \\"Smile.\\"  The camera cuts to behind them, and we see them together walking down the road.  It is an absolutely perfect image for the last seconds the Little Tramp will ever appear onscreen.camera cuts to behind them, and we see them together walking down the road.

B0002DB50E|4.0|This past week I was feeling mildly nefarious, so I decided to douse myself with the oleaginous and often sickening delights of David Cronenberg.  After watching in utter dismay the the tremendously awful Gummo (excuse my slip - it must have been impelled by my fragile and culpable adoration of big budget muscle-flicks - I mean the unquestioningly brilliant and profound Gummo)I rather gingerly inserted the new Videodrome disc into my dvd player.  I had viewed the film on two prior occassions some time ago, and I remember being vaguely disappointed with the film's incongruous denouement.  However, I heard that Criterion planned on giving the movie some prestigious treatment so I endeavored to pick it up and give the special features a cursory glance.  Well that minor fascination segued into a desire to see the film in its entirety so I invited a college buddy over to watch Mr. Cronenberg's celluloid exigency on the portentous capabilities of progressive technology.  Watching Videodrome this time around provided an ample opportunity to reassess its theories and meditations.  As previously I was impressed by the intriguing progression of the story (in its first incarnation - before the multitude of hallucinations), this time I was piqued by the intellectual implications of the film and the way in which they were presented.  What makes Videodrome a good movie and a worthwhile venture to me isn't the movie itself (which in objective summation does seem poorly executed - stained also with the eyebrow sizzling stagnancy of Debbie Harry's \\"performance\\") but its ideas, which in hindsight seems quite apropo given the exchange between two characters midway through the film (it's dangerous not because it is in being, but by virtue of the fact that it has something sorely lacking in most movies - a philosophy).  There's a certain resounding poignancy with the movie in contemporary society (probably more so now than when it was originally released) that almost suggest Cronenbergcan divine the future.  The main character's vested interest in sado-masochistic behavior for no conceivable reason other than idleness is analogous to the flux of survivor related game shows that push the endurance of ordinary denizens.  The intimation that our macabre obsession and media manipulation could ever contribute to the edification of anything remotely resembling Videodrome is both a strenuously unnerving and uncomfortably hilarious thought - to suggest that man has ascended so far up the evolutionary echelons to succomb to his own machinations.  This is what initially distinguishes Videodrome from Cronenberg's other features, but that doesn't necessarily admit equivocation with his other work.  Videodrome is irrefutably flawed by a myriad of things.  For one, the performances from the ancillary actors and actresses is enough to provoke a sour-faced wince from even the most ardent B-movie fan - for a movie that attempts to articulate so many fantastic ideas it's more than distracting to notice the inefficacy of the material's conduits (James Woods even comes close to gallivanting over the line of legitimate acting into the dark abyssmal depths of overacting - a territory thoroughly chartered by death-tempting daredevil Al Pacino).  Another palpable distraction is the abrupt shift in tone during the last 3/4's of the film.  Radically departing from an ostensibly feasible story about control and subjugation (very Burroughsian) to the phantasmagoria of subversive reactionary terrorism and assassination (reminescent from some strange reason of the Manchurian Candidate) is a truly defiant moment.  However, the way this shift was approached and executed was rather desultory and in a way embarassing.  If it seems I'm being too critical of the film I apologize, but if Cronenberg would have altered any small number of things then this film would indubitably reign as the apex of his artistic achievements.  However, since the film is noticeably flawed we must acceptthe material we've been given and abstain from pining about it.  But despite this small failure, Videodrome is a remarkable film with an impressive commentary.   <br />Moving on to the supplemental material is another matter entirely.  Criterion usually handles extra features with a daunting proficiency and here is no exception.  Videodrome is given professional treatment and features a number of arresting documentaries - one culminating the disparate talents of Mr. Cronenberg, John \\"I made one good film then died into self-abject torpor\\" Carpenter, and John Landis into a discussion of film; another documentary regales the viewer with trivia about the making of Videodrome and other Cronenbergian tidbits.   <br />Overall, I would only suggest Videodrome to those already cognitive of Cronenberg's particular brand of venereal horror - as I vent serious doubts that this would possibly lure in another Cronenberg fan.  A film that is as undercooked as Videodrome may seem tedious, but the social commentary grants it the impunity that will keep it on video store shelves everywhere for years to come.
B000001DQI|5.0|What more can be said about Goodbye Yellow Brick Road than has already been said?  What more can be said about the enormous talent of Mr. John & Mr. Taupin???  For nearly 40 years, they have entertained us with their gift of song.  I will only state here that this album is, was and always will be my personal favorite album of alltime.  This album has everything in it for everyone.  If you love it, you already know what I mean.  If you familar with it but haven't played it in a while, it is worth rediscovering.  If you have never heard of it, get ready for a treat!  Buy it and get ready to ROCK to the rockers, and ROLL with the ballads.  I think you will agree with me that it is a crime that this album failed to make it in the top 10 of VH1's top 100 albums.  This album is without a doubt Elton & Bernie's masterpiece.
1592400876|3.0|I applaud Lynne Truss for writing an entire book about a pet peeve and for being unashamed by her passion for proper punctuation.  The book starts out funny enough, and there were actually places where I laughed out loud.  Any person who is a self-proclaimed punctuation stickler can certainly appreciate Truss' (or is it Truss's?) book, as it gives the individual reader a sense that he or she is not alone.  Punctuation sticklers unite!      Aside from this false sense of punctuation-stickler unity, the book leaves a lot to be desired.  Halfway through, it became a book I just wanted to finish as quickly as I could so that I could move on and read something better.  The book lost its luster.  The humor became dull.  The ending was blah.    Truss's examples are actually quite good, in my opinion.  One of the funniest things was the way her other obsession, for Starburst candy, was revealed.  (I supposed that sentence should not be in the passive voice.)  She also discusses how the Internet and book reviews exactly like this one are unscholarly and merely serve to annoy punctuation sticklers.      As a whole, for all the passion that Truss seems to have in terms of punctuation, the book is lacking in passion itself.  It goes from being an exciting recount of one person's misadventures in a \\"banana's, for sale\\" world to an ineffective treatise.  I would not recommend this book for people who need to learn punctuation; however, even with its weaknesses, it would make a great (gag?) gift for a self-proclaimed punctuation nut.
0783231202|4.0|One of Spielberg's finer films, Amistad is actually based on a true story about the human beings right or lack of to live free.  The movie started out on a slave ship when the Africans that had been enslaved broke free and revolted.  After being mislead by the two Spanish survivors, the Africans landed on American soil.  Their landing then ensued one of the most controversial and historically significant series of court battles in the United States history. <br />       Spielberg does an excellent job portraying the struggle for the Africans freedom.  With some nice shots and some good actors the movie does the struggle over the Amistad some good justice.  Speaking of actors, Djimon Hounsou does a superb job acting as the reluctant leader of the Africans.  Also, Matthew McConaughey does an equally excellent job as the first lawyer for the Africans.  Although I tend to dislike Spielberg, he made a movie which all should see.  A nice 4 out of 5 star job.
B000000OF6|5.0|Easily one of the best compilations of any band. Queen meant many things to many people, and Freddie Mercury was an enigma at best, and a mystery at worst. If you like very clever arrangements, and rock the way it was meant to be, buy this album - you won't regret it.  Pay close attention to the musical arrangements, and the voices. While the rhythm is there, the clarity of pronunciation, and the tunes, oh the tunes...
B00006F83Y|5.0|Always a fan of QOTSA, and their predecessor Kyuss, I bought this CD. This one became my fovorite, above the self-titled CD, and Rated R. The track 'Hanging Tree' is a remake of the old Desert Session song of the same title, but works well with this disk. With help from the Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl, Songs for the Deaf is a Queens masterpiece. It's funny, but the song I liked least was the most popular one (No one Knows), but all the tracks are solid.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride The Lightning is Metallica's second album.  This is where you begin to see the maturing in their song writing, and album writing as a whole.  The songs are a lot more atmospheric and interesting.  Listen to the lead riff in \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", also note their first ballad \\"Fade To Black\\", lastly, let's not forget their first instrumental, The Call Of Ktulu, it's these elements that make Ride The Lightning more interesting and entertaining to the listener.  Production seems a little better than Kill Em All, and Hetfield is starting to find his singing voice a little better.  Musically, this is probably their heaviest album.  The lyrics are as great as they've always been with Metallica.  This is the first sign that there was more to Metallica than just lightning speed thrash band.  Highly recommended.
B000000993|5.0|Tool continues their development into progressive metal territory with their first full-length album, Undertow.  The band already is displaying mature songwriting and technical virtuosity early in their career.  The songs are dark and foreboding, the progressive metal movements churning along with the more melodic, softer sections that invoke a sense of dread and paranoia.  Includes \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex\\", two of the best singles Tool has ever put to tape.  Other highlights include \\"Bottom\\", a duet with Henry Rollins (Black Flag, Rollins Band), album opener \\"Intolerance\\", and the title track.  For an added thrill, skip ahead to album closer \\"Disgustipated\\" (track 69), a schizophrenic collage of preaching (!), screaming, drumming, feedback and samples that is truly frightening (along with a chilling, barely-audible monologue of a killer after around 7 or 8 minutes of silence after the track fades out)
B00005Y7AW|4.0|I would have given five stars, and wish i could do four and half, because this album deserves at least that.  His ideas and blending of classical and musical theater and rock and folk is so fresh, especially in today's onslought of popular trash.  The orchestration and instrumentation is engaging.  Just a great sound and great writing.  I don't always like the words that much, they're never too bad though, and sometimes they're good.  The only thing i don't like is his lyrical phrasing can be a little exhausting just because the phrases tend to last so long with little in the way of rests or breaks and sometimes his voice is a little abrasive.  so, with all that said, i guess i'll give it five stars!  Woohoo
B000003TAR|5.0|One of rock music's greatest albums, In Utero was the first, and last, album Nirvana released after they had changed rock music forever with Nevermind.  By this time, Kurt was becoming more depressed with his band, fans and life, and his angst clearly resonates in the music.  Gone is the new wave-influenced old days of Nirvana (Sliver, Aneurysm, About A Girl, Lithium); Kurt wanted to make a record to prove he wasn't just a top-40 poser rock star.  His intention was to create a more challenging album, possibly to shed all the pop fans he gained in the wake of Nevermind's popularity.  He enlisted the help of Indie-rock producer and musician extraordinaire Steve Albini (Big Black, Rapeman and Shellac, as well as producing for countless bands including The Pixies and The Jesus Lizard) to bring a more dynamic edge to the recordings.  The result was Nirvana's noisiest and most personal album, full of songs about feeling useless and indifferent with a sort of apologetic tone, but at the same time unsympathetic towards fans.  \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" is without a doubt one of the greatest rock tunes ever; it is frequently considered one the band's 3 or 4 best songs.  \\"Dumb\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" feature softer introspective verse parts with bombastic, crashing choruses.  \\"Rape Me\\" is a rather by-the-numbers Nirvana tune but one of their best songs as well, showcasing Cobain's mastery of the quiet-loud rock formula with unsettling subject matter (disposable rock music and pop culture consumed by rabid fans analogized as rape). <br /> <br />In Utero is heavy on stellar album tracks, from the sunny Nevermind pop of \\"Serve The Servants\\", the schizophrenic quiet-loud of \\"Frances Farmer\\", and the noisy, Jesus Lizard/Big Black inspired \\"Milk It\\" and \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter.\\" <br /> <br />All in all, a masterpiece and one of the three must-have Nirvana albums (along with Nevermind and MTV Unplugged).  Not to be merely recommended; it is absolutely essential.
B00004XONN|2.0|When I heard Pablo Honey, I was impressed with their music. When I heard The Bends, I was further impressed. OK Computer was an excellent album, however, they let their egos drive them for the rest of their career. Unfortunately, Kid A proves it. <br /> <br />The title in itself suggests an attempt to create a awkwardly profound album that would confuse the mainstream and some anti-corporate movements alike. Kid A is derived from Jacques Lacan's \\"Kid A in Alphabet Land\\". If you do not know who Mr. Lacan is, Jacques Lacan is a widely-known French philosopher that wrote very profound writings about many things that we do on an everyday basis. Unfortunately for Radiohead, the profoundity of the album title is far from consistent with the melodies and lyrics that lay inside. <br /> <br />OK Computer was definitely a deviation from the common alternative rock movement, but they failed to strengthen their hold on this album. The melodies are erratic and flowless, but I must admit that it is somewhat soothing on a day with nothing to do or a day with loads of work. Furthermore, if you take a deeper observation into their lyrics, one would come to find that they make absolutely no sense and are just \\"deep for the sake of being deep.\\" However, the difference between songs that are actually inherently deep and these lyrics is that those songs have meaning and purpose, while this entire album is devoid of that \\"maybe with the exception of 'How to Disappear Completely', which indirectly describes my everyday situations and feelings.'\\" To the person that actually listens to music for the quality of music, like me, those lyrics would sum up to equal the redundancy and complaining of everyday \\"rock stars\\" today, however to the person that is mainstreamed or \\"anti-corporate\\" on a surface level (or anti-corporate for the sake of boasting that they actually listen to artists that others have never heard of), these lyrical follies would be ranked near Nirvana's glory and Britney Spear's stardom. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I am very disappointed about this album, as it does not exactly meet my expectations of Radiohead (even though the rest of their albums after OK Computer are simply OK). It is best suited for periods which one is really not too concerned about music and just has something on for the sake of havin something on.
0671027573|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this book.  I recently read \\"Cry No More\\" by Linda Howard and loved it.  So when this book was highly recommended by friends and your reviews - I thought it would be great.  It is completely unrealistic, unbelievable, boring and I had a hard time getting through it.  The mystery was horrible and the dialogue awful.  I will however try another Linda Howard - hopefully one with more substance.

B00006690G|4.0|It seems that Marshall has a lot to say still, and he seems to have gotten more serious in comparison to his previous 2 albums.  He seems to get better as things go along...lets just hope his new album (allegedly released November 2004) will carry on this tradition!
055357342X|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\" and its subsequent books are easily the most original fantasy works since Tolkien. <br />   <br />  1. The dialogue is absolutely phenomenal. <br /> <br />  2. The battle scenes include overall strategies, close battlefield tactics, and realistic maneuvers. <br /> <br />  3. Strong Character development, you will like few and hate many characters in the early stages of this work. <br /> <br />  4. The author obviously did thorough research on Medieval/Feudal life; there are no \\"sassy\\" peasants in this book. <br /> <br />  5. Some readers want to finish the book with a happy ending, they want to \\"feel good\\" about what they have read, you will get none of that immaturity in this book.  George R.R. Martin is a professional, not a kindergarten teacher. <br /> <br />  6.This is not an allegorical text, it will not provide \\"insight\\" to our own lives, the book was not written to dole out \\"life lessons\\".   <br /> <br />  7. This has few if any feminist ideals in it; many modern works of fiction tend to have an unrealistically dominant feminine presence.  There are strong female characters but true to the medieval background, they are not (clearly) paramount. <br /> <br />  8. Details.  This Book and the Series are great because of its attention to detail.  The author does not wear out the same adjectives repeatedly. <br /> <br />  9. If you read fiction at all, this is priority reading.  If you haven't read it make it #1 on your \\"to do\\" list. <br /> <br />  10.  And lastly, this is an unusual Fantasy book, magic is subtle, by doing so the author conveys a greater sense of realism to the story. <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|I, like many, grew up with these movies. For many years, since DVD technology came out, I waited for these movies to be released on DVD. However, over the last many years, I have given up on Lucas and anything he plays a part in. It is not about creating a masterpiece for all to enjoy. It is simply about the money. He stalls and delays to make more money. He releases multiple versions of these movies to make money. I am also very dissapointed that the original versions will not be included in this set. So much so that I am going to pass.<br /><br />Why am I going to pass them up? Simply because Lucas is only doing it this to make more money. He does not care about the consumer. Think about his mode of operation over the years. If you think about it long enough, you will be able to guess his next move. No matter what he says right now, the original versions will be released in the future. When we will never know, but they will be released when the timing is right to be able to make the most money.  Why include the original versions when you can sell the altered versions now, wait for a long period of time, and sell the original versions for a premium later.<br /><br />I will miss seeing them and do not like missing out on the DVD versions. However, I am not the type to fall for someone's propaganda and devious marketing ploys.  I may be in the minority on this in the long run, but Lucas' coffers will be a few dollars less then it otherwise could be.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Sarah is a beautiful but delusional teenage girl living with her overbearing parents and incessantly crying baby brother. She immerses herself in a world of fairytale fantasy to forget her day-to-day strife, and rehearses lines from books in the hope of one day becoming a great actress like her real mother. But on one particularly stormy night, Sarah is left alone to tend to her baby brother yet again, and the assignment is more than she can bear. She finally makes a hasty wish for the infant to be taken away by goblins, to trouble her no more! --- Her wish is granted. --- Sarah suddenly finds herself alone in a fairy kingdom on a magical quest to save her brother, journeying beyond the gates of the goblin city and to the castle of the very Goblin King himself, but to get there she first must solve the Labyrinth!<br /><br />From fantasy masters Jim Henson and George Lucas comes a film that delighted a generation! Labyrinth is a magical fantasy  that combines the Wizard of Oz, Alice In Wonderland, and the Return of the Jedi, with an 80's twist in the form of David Bowie's one of a kind musical style. The film follows Sarah's transformation from bratty teenage girl to sympathetic and endearing heroine, as she makes her way through all the traps and twists the Goblin King sets before her, picking up new friends as she goes, from the ugly but good-hearted dwarf, Hoggle, and an enormous, hairy simpleton called Ludo, to brave Sir Didymus the fox and his noble steed, Ambrosius the dog. Almost the entire cast is direct from Jim Henson's creature shop, featuring an assortment of weirdies and baddies the likes of which you've hopefully never seen. And there's more magic still, thanks to the sorcery of Jareth, the Goblin King, portrayed beautifully by the hypnotic personage of David Bowie. Jennifer Connelly holds her own as Sarah though, looking more beautiful than I have ever seen her, and far too hot to be the staying at home and reading Tolkien on a Friday-night type, but we'll let that slide in lieu of the gorgeous eye-candy. If Henson and Lucas were aiming for a timeless classic here, ala \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" they may have missed the mark, as the music of the film dates it as unmistakably 80's. Nevertheless, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of filmmaking in true Jim Henson style, a great trip for the 80's fantasy enthusiast, and an excellent piece of fantasy entertainment for anyone who is a fan of the genre. More than a few elements from the world of Harry Potter were clearly inspired by this film, just as it was inspired by the classic fantasies that came before it. \\"Labyrinth\\" is a true work of art, and a true milestone of fantasy entertainment!<br /><br />The DVD is in widescreen, featuring a fullscreen theatrical trailer, and a long and informative behind the scenes featurette that includes interviews with the performers and creators, not to mention more lovely footage of Jennifer Connelly.

B00005JNEI|1.0|I have read almost all of the reviews and find many of them very entertaining. More entertaining than the movie actually. What is funny is the people who say they made up their political minds because of a movie. When you saw the movie Independence Day, did you leave the major cities for fear of an alien attack?  There are some truths in the documentary. There are also some twisted truths and some outright lies. To make up your politcal mind based solely on this is frightening. People will go to vote based on this and this alone for someone to run our country?<br /><br />Moore, by creating this documentary, had only one thing in mind. I do not even believe it was to reshape the minds of many. It was simply to make money. Has Bush made mistakes as the film suggests, absolutely. Would I rather have a Republican in the time of war, most definately. Do I think the Iraq war was a mistake, yes. We should have done it right the first time and finished the job.<br /><br />The one thing I have always been glad to know and see is that most liberals or simply chronic complainers are good for not voting when the time comes. At least there is some relief in knowing that so a President does not get elected simply because of a documentary created by one person.
B00008DDRX|5.0|This is not a movie, but an adrenaline rush.  The plot is the 1970 Le Mans, it does not need a Hollywood storyline.  This will disapoint those wanting a Steve McQueen acting job.  He just acts himself which most people cannot understand.  For those who have gone fast or wish too, this is your film.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have had the pleasure of attending 2 concerts by John Mayer and i can officially say that John DOES have talent. I own both albums and can say that they possess the talents of a real musican.For example, John's \\"No Such Thing\\" is a freedom song for so many students. While \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" is a song for all those couples around the world. \\"Daughters\\" is a song dedicate to all those parents. It teachs parents that they shape the values of their children.  <br />John Mayer is a awesome artist who uses metaphors and poetry to express himself. John also has a magical talent when it comes to the guitar. During his concerts, that were well worth my money, he began to play the guitar off hand. It sounded so awesome and it was all made up on the spot. If you ask a guitarist to play John they will realize how much talent he has because his music is very difficult to play. He does not play the ordinary simple music that any kindergarden could play, he challenges himself unlike other artists.  <br />I would recommend John Mayer to anyone. He has talent not only lyrical talent but also instrumental talent.His concerts are full of energy and I promise you won't sit down a moment. You get what you paid for and so much more. <br />
B0002S94OS|5.0|This cd will blow you away. The band is back and stronger than ever after signing with epic. These guys didn't \\"sell out\\", they are still the metal kings. Every song is agressive and powerful, with wonderful production on every song. The one really noticable element that was improved was the drumwork, so much cleaner on this cd than on ATPB. Every fan of metal should get a copy of this cd, it is wonderful. Should be album of the year, probably along with the new Shadows Fall on Sept 21st. Lamb of God are the kings of metal and are not giving up their crown any time soon.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Having been forewarned by reviewers and friends that saw this movie in theaters I was prepared for a very bloody and a very very violent film. Since I really didn't need one and a half hours of splattering blood I waited to see this film 'when it came out on DVD' .....  <br /> <br /> <br />Yes the film was violent, but certainly not gratuitous ... Unlike Schindlers List where the director filmed in black and white to dull the graphic vilence of that film, I didn't get the feeling that 'The Passion' went over the top .....  <br /> <br /> <br />Not being a biblical scholar I was taken back to remember passages of the bible and the film pretty much depicts what I remember being taught when young.  <br /> <br /> <br />A point of aggravation with this DVD however was the subtitles which had a tendency of disappearing causing me to stop the film on several occasions to reactivate the subtitles ...  <br /> <br /> <br />Certainly a better DVD than I had expected ... Bravo Mel Gibson ! <br />
0385495323|5.0|Read this a couple years back and I remember I could not put it down.  Singh is a great writer and knows how to tell a story.<br /><br />The strongest point of the book is that it is NOT meant to be a technical learning device.  It's nice to see the historical background in which a particular cryptographic method evolved for a change.  The Mary Queen of Scots and Enigma sections were particularly well written.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

What's done is done.\\" packs more punch that I thought possible from a library CD.<br /><br />\\"One of the Few\\", \\"The Soldier's Return\\", and \\"Parnoid Eyes\\" are about the side of homecoming you don't see- recovery.<br /><br />The only track I realy didn't like was \\"Not Now, John\\". It's punchy and the most danceable mumber on the CD, but it doesn't seem to fit.<br /><br />Musically, the heavy strings lend a depth which makes the mood a bit dark, but not depressing. The bridge in \\"Paranoid Eyes\\" is a good example, deep and slow, but moving.<br /><br />I'd reccommend this to anyone who likes Pink Floyd or classical/rock combinations. No, it's not \\"The Wall\\", but it's good.
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Animatrix is the final piece of the Matrix series that contains details into the original trilogy that makes the story whole, instead of filled with microscopic holes. There are nine short stories in all: <br /> <br />THE SECOND RENAISSANCE: PARTs I &II <br /> <br />This was my least favorite. Though the story shows the true beginnings of the century-long war against the machines, it contained violence for violence sake. Not much dialouge, barely any plot, obsurdly violent. Some may appreciate it for its explination of the Matrix and the fight to destroy it but I felt sick watching such mindless carnage. Two stars for both, only becuase it explains humans started the war. <br /> <br />PROGRAM <br /> <br />By far my favorite in the entire collection. This story concerns two unplugged humans fighting inside a medievil Matrix. Very detailed, the fight sequence on horseback is something Akira Kurosawa would have made. Some may say the plot is a little shaky (if existant) but I felt the story good enough and the animation above average in detail. Five stars. <br /> <br />A DETECTIVE'S STORY <br /> <br />This is one of two stories that actually contain characters from the Matrix trilogy (this one has Trinity). My memory on the story is shaky but the story is something along the lines of a detective getting a call and winding up running from Agents. The animation is in black-and-white, inspiring a sense of the old, 1930s style of detective work. Very good, Five stars. <br /> <br />WORLD RECORD <br /> <br />An interesting story but shaky in animation. The story is about an athlete who tries to break the world record but somehow discovers to break free from the Matrix's constraints (similar to Neo). A very freaky set of Agents attempt to stop him from releasing himself from their bonds. Four stars, for the animation. <br /> <br />FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS <br /> <br />An exceptional CGI-story about the Osiris, mentioned in RELOADED, and how it discovers the Sentinel army digging to Zion. Excellent CG (ten times better then that of PIXAR's work or FINAL FANTASY) makes this story a wonder to the eyes but the plot is quite basic: Let's get this message to someone before we die. Five stars, even with the overused plot. <br /> <br />MATRICULATED <br /> <br />This is one I've almost completely forgotten becuase I didn't like it. The story is something about humans in the Real World capturing a Sentinel to convert it to their side but more Sentinels come. The conversion scenes are quite weird (similar to what I'd call an \\"acid dream\\") but that doesn't stop me from giving it three stars. <br /> <br />BEYOND <br /> <br />An interesting story and a weird main character make this one better then MATRICULATED but not as good as PROGRAM or FINAL FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS. The plot is a young woman looses her cat and runs to find it. She travels with some kids to a haunted house which seems to produce Matrix-defying fields that allow broken bottles to fix once smashed and people to fall from buildings but stop before death. But the Agents are on the way and they don't like it. Five stars, quite intersting <br /> <br />KID'S STORY <br /> <br />Remember that annoying boy from RELOADED who said Neo \\"saved\\" him. This is the story. A kid is typing on his computer (similar to Neo in MATRIX) when he's contacted (lo and behold) by Neo himself. The kid is soon attacked by Agents and, well, you know what's going to happen basically but the sketchy Korean artwork is quite interesting. Four stars, only becuase though I liked sketchy for its message, I didn't like it that much.
037571457X|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. Marjane Satrapi is an excellent writer, as well as, an outstanding illustrater. I am touched by her talent.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I am still not one of those who thinks this movie is one of the best movies of all time but these reviews are spot on about many things. I have a newly found appreciation for what this movie is about.
B000002L9J|5.0|Being too young to understand the smiths the frist time (I was about 4 when this album came out), I made my way back into some of the greatest Alteravite rock bands. This Album is amazing. At frist only a few songs stood out the frist time I heard it, but after a week I fell in love with this whole CD. \\"There is a light that never goes out\\" is my favourite and let me tell you, it is the ultimate love song ever... in a sad yet loving way. I could go on about everything that is so good but I've already read some reviews that say everything thats needs to be said. Anyone looking for something new should buy this album, it's a must.
B000002MY3|5.0|When you talk about the biggest albums of the 90s, you certainly have to talk about 1995's Jagged Little Pill.  Alanis Morissette, to my mind, came to represent a version of the new woman of the 90s, leaving no questions as to her feelings and, some might say, demands.  Decades ago, Aretha wanted R-E-S-P-E-C-T, but Alanis wants much more than that, and as far as I'm concerned, she deserves it.  Apparently, at least one guy did Alanis wrong at some point; some women get mad, some get even - Alanis has the strength to do both.  I for one love a strong woman.<br /><br />To many, Alanis burst on the scene from out of nowhere with this mega-smash CD.  I have one of her first two albums, so I know better.  As a teenager, Alanis actually found stardom in Canada singing, of all things, bubble gum pop.  I know - it's hard to believe.  I don't think any artist has ever undergone such a radical transformation as Alanis did from her teen albums to Jagged Little Pill.<br /><br />Do I even need to talk about the songs?  Were any of these tracks not smash hit singles?  It all started with You Oughta Know, which was a revelation of sorts to many radio listeners.  Harsh, angry, a little perverted, cursed with a couple of those silly bleeps radio stations just have to use - this was something different, and it just so happened to rock, as well.  Alanis says everything all the good girls wronged by bad guys want to say but cannot to the heels in their lives.  Right Through You comes in from the other direction to hit the target; Alanis, as a new woman of the 90s, is far too smart to fall for all the shuck and jive guys try to sell the ladies.  She knows what guys want, but she is not about to let herself become nothing more than a conquest some jerk can brag to his friends about.  Experience has been one of her teachers, as described in the song You Learn.  I think the song Forgiven plays into this theme, as well, although it's a little too complex a song for me to claim I fully understand it - it's got some of the edgiest, most passionate lyrics on the album, though.  Of course, nobody's Perfect (clever segue, eh?), and life truly has a painful tendency to be Ironic at just the wrong times, but don't dismiss Alanis as some angry psycho-beast.  She knows and likes herself, she knows what she wants (Not the Doctor vividly describes what she does not want), and Hand in My Pocket proves she is perfectly all right out there on her own.  Wake Up, she urges the rest of us, and go get what you want rather than pining away waiting for it to find you.  That very love that sends a person completely Head Over Feet is still possible - although you might have to go through a long line of jerks to find it.  You don't have to become like Mary Jane, letting yourself waste away without hope.<br /><br />In the end, Jagged Little Pill is not as angry an album as it might first appear.  This music is all about self-empowerment, standing up and believing in yourself, living life with both eyes open and a never-dying sense of hope.  I think a spirit of optimism runs through this music, negating the angry sentiment that lies on the surface.  I've barely talked about the music itself from this album, and part of the reason why, I believe, is the fact that Jagged Little Pill is one of those rarest of albums, a collection of songs that transcends the music and speaks to the listener's mind and soul.  Let it also be known, lest there be any doubt, that - to quote many a reviewer of music in this little online community of ours - this album totally rocks.understand it - it's got some of the edgiest, most passionate lyrics on the album, though.

B000099T2L|5.0|You hear those words spoken, BEYONCE, and you automatically think, beauty, success, and someone who can actually sing. People who actually rate this album with a 3 star or less obviously have no idea what they are talking about, music wise, and are basing their rating merely on opinions.<br />    Indeed, the cd begins outstanding with a hip, fast r&amp;b approach, with Carzy in Love, Nauhgty Girl, Baby Boy, and Hip Hop Star.  After, she tries to  bring the speed down almost for the rest of the cd, with Be with you, Me Myself and I, And Speechless as examples. This i would have to say is expected, following the name given to the cd, Dangerously in Love, it was obvious the cd was to be diverse in musical vocals.<br />     Each song has a unique tune to it, obviously she's trying to prove her diversity as an artist.  And man, she hits the spot.  Not only can she prove to be more than an R&amp;B artist, she sings passionatly and you can feel her emotions as she belts out those high B Sharps.<br />    Her debut album is an example of an artist who knows what they're doing.  She can bring you into the mood of each song, and how she brings the vocals from fast to slow, its a jolly old rollercoaster ride, and it was a pleasure to listen to.<br />       Although, heres come criticism in my opinion.  Although all the ttracks are excellently written and produced, I was hoping to here more upbeat songs rather than sad love songs.  I'm not much of a slow song person, but she can bring you in and like it no matter what. Despite that, more faster songs would be pleasant to hear on the track.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger , yes the Governor of California, became an internation superstar with the \\"Terminator\\". <br /> <br />Originally James Cameron's most famous project besides \\"Titanic\\", <br />\\"The AByss\\" and other hits almost never got made. All the major <br />movie studies to Fox to Paramount rejected it as shown on the <br />E Special behind the scenes. Then came \\"Orion Picturez\\" yes <br />the same Orion who also distributed the famous Robocop with Peter <br />Weller. <br /> <br />Orion not a household name deserves a ton of credit for giving <br />the best scifi movie in the 80's. <br /> <br />We have seen from then on a multitude of Terminator copied <br />movies, but this one started it all. <br />A cyborg from the future is sent in to kill SarAH Conner <br />(Linda Hamilton who also married Cameron) because Sarah will <br />give birth to John Conner a leader who in the future will fight <br />back against the deadly cyborgs like Terminator. <br /> <br />Meanwhile a soldier from the future, Kyle Reese (Michael Bien) <br />is sent in to save Sarah and make sure she gives birth to John <br />Connor. <br /> <br />Wow, visually speaken this is the best looking scifi film <br />since Star Wars. Cameron spent an enormous budget and put <br />onscreen for us. <br /> <br />His casting choices of Bien, Hamilton and Arnold were right on the money as it became a huge success. <br /> <br />The dvd comes with a number of deleted scenes , a featurette, <br />and commentary. Get it now.

B0002IU988|5.0|With Mark Tremonti's blistering leads and Myles Kennedy's wailing vocals, this album is a must have.  Even fans of Scott Stapp will be able to fully enjoy it.  Many CD's that I buy, I have to listen to a few times before it really grows on me, but this album had me moving from the first lick. <br /> <br />     One Day Remains has the song for everyone.  Although much more aggressive than any of Creed's material it still contains the slower melodic rock that many people enjoy.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I was very interested in seeing this movie for two reasons:  1)  Mel Gibson, as a director, is outstanding, and 2)  All of the controversy that surrounded this film.  After seeing this movie, I cannot figure out what the hub-bub was all about.  If you look at the movie from a technical standpoint, then you will not be disappointed.  The cinematography was good, the acting was excellent, and the special effects were top-notch (this last point is especially true.  I feel that the gruesome and vicious portrayal of Jesus' torture was done in a manner that aesthetically tasteful and not done just to \\"gross everybody out\\").  If you look at this movie from a religious standpoint, again, you will not be disappointed.  I am not an overly religious individual, but I was very moved by the portrait of Christ's last 12 hours.  The human mind can fathom many things and conjure up many images, but Mel Gibson did breathtaking job of showing what those last moments probably were like for all involved, from Pontius Pilate, to Judas Iscariot, to the Devil himself.  Buy this movie; I highly recommend it.
B00028HBKM|3.0|This movie was ok, but at times I was confused by the lack of dialogue.  I couldn't quite follow what that guy from Thin Red Line and Frequency had done wrong.  The details were rather sketchy so I still feel that I was not able to piece it all together.  But, the film was sooo beautiful that it hardly even bothered me that I was lost.  Kudos to the cineamatographer!!! <br /> <br />One question: Jesus?  Who's Jesus? <br /> <br />I also felt that it was a little too bloody.  I heard somewhere that people who are religious were taking young children to see this film.  I cannot condone this, for a lot of the film centers around one man being brutally tortured.  It is more violent than any other Mel Gibson movie I have seen including the Lethal Weapon movies and Braveheart.  Please don't take your children to see this movie!!!  It is a reminder of all that is violent in the world, and I must stress that this is real violence that is depicted, not CARTOON VIOLENCE!   <br /> <br />If you liked this movie, check out Dogma by Kevin Smith, another great movie that has religious themes, but is not dominated with blood, guts and gore.  It is closer to a family film because of the lighthearted nature, but some of the language may not be acceptable to all young ears.   <br /> <br />If you or your family is offended by the \\"F word,\\" the \\"S word,\\" and the \\"H-E-double hockey stick word,\\" I recommend that you skip Dogma and go right for the Passion.  None of those vile and obsence words appear in the Passion at all.  So I guess, if your family is bothered by violence watch Dogma, but if they are bothered by language then the Passion is for you! <br /> <br />Now that I've seen the movie, now I'm going to read the book!  Thanks, Amazon for the free shipping! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000634EV|5.0|I'm getting really sick of all these Pantera fans hating on Phil Anselmo's other projects. Guess what? Pantera SUCKED before Phil came along. He saved them from being a glam metal band and made them legendary. Now, look at Damageplan. Collaberations with Corey Taylor? Not if Phil was around. Damageplan sucks. It's obvious where the heart and soul of Pantera was. <br /> <br />Down II is just as good as its predecessor. I know a lot of you might not agree, but I'm more into soulful acousticy numbers than all out metal. This album has a good share of both, and the order in which they shift between clean and metal are amazing. I can listen to this cd all the way through, just like I could with NOLA. My personal favourite song of this album is Learn from My Mistake. I feel it is one of the best songs ever written about heroin addiction.  <br /> <br />This album also features Rex Brown from Pantera, who was also excluded from Damageplan, and is now in Crowbar \m/ Even though they broke the tradition of all NOLA members, his bass is heavy as hell on this album. Kirk from Crowbar remains, as does Jimmy Bower(EHG/Crowbar) and Pepper Keenan(COC). Any fans of the Louisiana sludge scene will love this, and for those just getting into this little scene...well this isn't a good start, but buy some Eyehategod and Crowbar albums, then buy this one. I wouldn't recommend this to Pantera fans, because they're dumb.
B0000D96NW|5.0|WOW! thats was the only thing that came to mind when I first heard this record. I wasn't into Machine Head before this record too much (I'm not bashing them or anything, I just really never heard much of there music) and one of friends were selling this album for $10 and I bought it and I'm so happy with the buy. The musicians on here are great Rob has an amazing voice and good guitar player and also Phil and the bassist Adam. The drummer Dave is really good some of fills that that he does are really cool. It is really worth every penny. So you can all rock out to Machine Head. <br /> <br />Best Tracks: Imperium, Bite the Bullet, Left Unfinished, Days Turn Blue To Gray, Seasons Wither, All Fall Down, and Desend The Shades Of Night
B0001611DI|1.0|I'm not trying to desecrate any opinions or start any fights, but there have been several reviews bashing this film, and I truly have to agree w/them.  The film is certainly not a \\"horror classic,\\" as it has been called, and it's much more hyped up than it deserves to be. <br />We can start w/the good things about this film:  the tagline is great, the music decent, and the idea is truly horrifying, but the feeling I get from this film is that Romero doesn't always know what direction he wants to take.  The acting and the writing are so unbelievably bad, the film provides many more laughs than scares, so at first, you're under the impression that Romero is trying to make a comedy.  Then, at the most random times, he makes the decision to throw some of the goriest and most disturbing scenes at you, as though he's saying, \\"This entire film you haven't been taking me seriously.  Well...take me seriously NOW!\\"  Whether he's trying to provide viewers w/a funny film or a scary film, Romero fails miserably. <br />Then, there's the make-up effects:  this is where we must give Night of the Living Dead its points.  Despite the fact that it was created during an earlier age, the zombies actually look like zombies.  Dawn of the Dead, which was released in 1978, ten years after its predecessor, has had a good while to progress in the field of make-up...this is not evident.  The blood is pink, and the zombies look like (and probably are) just a group of extras that have had their faces splashed with gray paint, and you can actually see the lines on their necks where the make-up ends, and on top of that, the zombies are slow, stupid, and completely non-menacing.  The film is much longer than it needs to be, offers no character development, and is boring in every aspect.  Night of the Living Dead definitely has its corny moments, but after seeing it, you definitely feel the need to look behind you every once in while.  After seeing Dawn, you'll find yourself feeling sleepy. <br />Wenow move on to the most important aspect of the film.  The previews, posters, and pretty much all forms of publicity use the phrase, \\"When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.\\"  Despite this fact, it is never once explained in the film that this is the reason why the dead are returning to life.  In fact, we receive no explanation at all for this \\"phenomenon\\" (for lack of a better term).  There is actually plenty of unexplained material and activity in this film.  The beginning makes no sense, whatsoever, and neither does the biker scene that serves as the climactic end.  For example, during the \\"biker\\" raid, one thug, despite the fact that he's surrounded by several hungry zombies, randomly decides to give himself a blood pressure test.  Naturally, he's devoured w/in a matter of seconds. <br />Finally, there seems to be some sort of idea that this is Romero's take on social commentary.  He has denied this on several occasions. <br />In conclusion, I would say completely avoid the original.  The remake is a huge improvement, offering greater acting, writing, character development, and zombies that can definitely be defined as \\"NASTY.\\"
B0001CCXY8|5.0|The new Cannibal Corpse album The Wretched Spawn is by far one of there best albums of all time. I have never really been a Cannibal fan for to long now. None of there past albums really moved me and got me into them. I don't know I was more into Morbid Angel, Six Feet Under and Deicide. Until I saw them Live. They are a great band if you guys ever get the chance to see them live and I alot got every members autographs which was very cool. So after the show, the next day I went out to best buy and bought the Wretched Spawn and I got into Cannibal Corpse. The new album is just great from top to bottom. It is worth every penny that you spent for it and it will blow your mind how fast and how brutal it is. All the songs on here are the best. So just go out there and F'n buy it.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|\\"Underworld\\" is fun to watch, but it's really nothing more than an average sci-fi/action flick.  One thing is for sure, this movie is in no way a horror film.  Take any standard action yarn, replace the good guys with vampires and the bad guys with werewolves.  Next, throw in a twist that bonds one of the goodies and baddies together.  Finally, blend in a betrayal and a cover-up and you basically have the storyline.  There's nothing new here.<br /><br />The two supernatural enemies really don't even use their powers against each other that much.  The \\"death dealer\\" vampires have more guns than a cult in Waco.  They don't even get close to ripping open the necks of their enemies. The werewolves, for the most part, are happy reliving scenes from \\"Fight Club\\" in the city's subway tunnels.<br /><br />Don't think that this flick isn't enjoyable, though.  It is visually fun to watch and the action is pretty good.  I just wish that the vamps and wolves could have used their powers a little more than their guns.  The betrayal and cover-up mentioned earlier does actually make you pull for one side of the conflict a little more than the other, but in the end, you just want to see these folks beat the heck out of each other until someone yells, \\"Uncle!\\"<br /><br />If you want real vampire or werewolf action, check out a movie like \\"Interview With The Vampire\\"(better yet, read the book), or \\"Silver Bullet\\"(again, the book is better).  If you just want a little brainless action, \\"Underworld\\" will suffice.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Ignore the reviewers who call this film \\"dull\\" or \\"boring\\" or \\"overlong\\"; they're obviously the kind of people who think Will & Grace is the height of comedy.  <br /> <br />Ignore the ones who claim Schindler's List is better; Polanski's film goes way beyond Spielberg's sugary tale. <br /> <br />Most of all, ignore the beer-swilling, NASCAR-loving rednecks who claim Brody's character is a coward. They must have thought this film had lots of explosions and guns.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If all the republicans went and saw this movie, most of their outlooks on Bush would probably change. This movie is a great wrapup on the past 4 years with George Bush as a preisident. Although there are some boring and confusing parts in this movie, overall it's the best movie this year.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I've watched it three or four times now, and it's grown on me a bit... but overall I find Daredevil to be disappointing. I loved a lot of what was done with the character at some of the better points in the comic book, and this maintains the tone of those parts of DD's history. The story is good, Daredevil should be somewhat tormented and his world is dark and gritty (in contrast to Spider-man.)The action is good, but when will moviemakers figure out that CGI just doesn't convincingly replicate people yet? (I had the same problem with some of Blade 2's action sequences.) <br /> <br />The acting is what kills this movie for me. Affleck is OK as Matt Murdock, but pretty awful as Daredevil... DD should be fluid and graceful, and yet in most of the action sequences he looks stiff and wooden. Garner did a great job on the action, but her acting was weak. Farrell as Bullseye was great, very over-the-top (as Bullseye should be.) Duncan did a good Kingpin, too. Unfortunately, good performances from the villians and supporting characters can't overcome the two leads, at least for me. <br /> <br />If you're a big Daredevil fan, give it a shot, but don't have very high expectations. I went into this wanting to love it and came away finding it merely somewhat entertaining. Maybe the forthcoming Electra movie will get it right...
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Lets start with the location: Slane Castle, Ireland. Slane is renowned worldwide for the annual Rock Concerts held in the natural amphitheater in front of the Castle. Artists such as U2, R.E.M., Oasis, Neil Young, David Bowie, Queen, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones and Madonna have performed live. So The Red Hot Chili Peppers are in good company here.<br /><br />The Peppers deliver a mind blowing performance. I would go as far as to say that the live performance are better than the album version of the songs in several cases. John Frusciante delivers a blistering performance, changing up riffs, adding guitar sections, and adding more funk to the show. John also as an incredible voice. Some people don't realize how much Frusciante adds to the band; but they will after seeing this DVD.<br /><br />Not only is the performance perfect, so is the production. This is probably the best sounding live concert I've ever purchased, and I have several. The sound is very loud. The guitars, bass, and drums all sound crystal clear; and nothing over powers Anthony's incredible vocals.<br /><br />This DVD is worth every penny. You'll find yourself watching it multiple times.
B00005JKC3|3.0|People have two views of the Hulk: Bill Bixby wandering from place to place and inadvertantly righting wrongs via his green growling alter-ego, or the monosyllabic Green Goliath duking it out with a variety of monstrous villians in the old comic books. (Personally, my favorite incarnation was Peter David's intelligent Hulk of about 10 years ago.) <br /> <br />Unfortunately for the bean-counters (and the Hulk fans) it failed to live up to any of the expectations. Ang Lee put together an artsy, slow-paced psychological drama with a few sequences of moderately enjoyable Hulk action. Throw in a somewhat confusing ending and you have a box office bomb (or should that be a box office dud?) <br /> <br />Sorry, Marvel. After an excellent film version of Spider-man and a good translation of the X-men, this just wasn't what people were looking for. Wish I could recommend it, but it's only going to work if you go in with a VERY open mind (and maybe not even then.)
B00004SCX6|3.0|To me this album was like an attempt to \\"redo\\" the first album with different tracks.  Realistically, this album is probably better sounding than the first, but it's like britney made a cheap knock-off of her own debut album and trying to milk more money from it.  However if you're still a fan of hers or pop music, I recommend listening to the album Walk of Life by Billie Piper.  Billie was first, just less promoted, which is why she was often interpretted as the UK's britney spears. Anyway, back to britney, get this album if you liked her first album, like it or not is up to you, but be prepared for disappointment.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This film features footage so incredible it is hard to believe that Michael Moore was able to obtain it. Must see!
0684801558|4.0|Highly recommended.  Extremely compelling.  Still relevant today although first published 80 years ago.  A truly remarkable and memorable book. <br /> <br />For me reading great fiction is a bit like holding a mirror up to life.  In some characters I see parts of myself and in other characters I see parts of other people in my life.  With good fiction the characters are so vividly drawn that they seem real.  You get to know them and sometimes you like them and sometimes you don't, but they're always believable and you can identify with their emotions and choices in life.  For me that's the sort of book this is - and much much more. <br /> <br />The Beautiful and Damned is a tragic portrayal of a 1920s society enamored with beauty and wealth (I told you it was still relevant today).  The novel traces the gradual downfall of Anthony Patch and his wife Gloria.  When we first meet Anthony he is young, well educated and wealthy.  Thanks to the generous allowance he receives from his wealthy Grandfather he doesn't have to work and instead spends his days lunching, philosophizing and drinking with his friends while he plans his entry into working life - perhaps as a statesman; perhaps as a writer.  Life is a series of Broadway plays and extravagant meals.  Nice for some.   <br /> <br />When Anthony meets the beautiful, flirty and narcissistic Gloria he falls hopelessly in love.  After a wonderful courtship they marry and the party really begins.  While they wait for Anthony's Grandfather to die and pass his millions on to them, the young couple enjoy an endless string of parties, traveling and extravagance.   <br /> <br />It is at about this point in the book that you begin to see a change.  Up until now Fitzgerald portrays Anthony as pretentious and lazy, but generally a nice enough guy.  Gloria is undoubtedly vain and selfish, but is also bubbly, fun and honest.  Initially their life together is filled with optimism and breezy cheerfulness and they are undoubtedly a funcouple to be around.  However, as they drink more (in particular Anthony) life begins to lose its rosy glow and we begin to see different, less pleasant parts of their personalities.  Gradually at first and then faster and faster their downfall accelerates until they each face personal humiliation and suffer pathetic debacle.  Believe it or not, it is actually quiet a heartbreaking story. <br /> <br />What makes this book so good for me is that it seems real.  Anthony and Gloria (or parts of them) are people that you probably know.  It all seems very believable.  They make bad choices and they pay the consequences - just like real life.  The supporting cast of characters that live on the edge of Anthony and Gloria's world also add a huge amount to the story.  While flawed in their own ways they generally make a success of their lives.   <br /> <br />Essentially a chronicle of alcoholic ruin, wasted opportunities and squandered talent, The Beautiful and Damned is a very compelling story.  To my mind it's a first-class example of what a novel should be.  A book to be savoured and enjoyed. <br />
B000002AH7|5.0|This work remains among the giants albums of the jazz in any time . The Miles Davis inspiration in this particular case was overwhelming . Not only for his rapture sound , but for the challenging fact to blend two well different moods as the Spanish music and the jazz .<br /><br />Davis absorbed the inner moods of Joaquin Rodrigo in his famous Adagio and made of this melody a theme with variations with so kind of musicanship that you may state he established a new landmark in his brilliant career .<br /><br />The question for you is if you have to acquire this recording or not ; but how can you live without having it in your personal collection ?<br /><br />Supreme perfection would the best title to qualify this recording!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|now this is something you don't wanna miss out on. anyone who gives this album anything less than five star does not appriciate good music. this album wasn't over hyped its just that good. it was able to capture the attention from fans and non fans of all diff. backgrounds with diff. taste of music. you have beat it for the rock fan, human nature for r&b fan, pyt for pop fans... the music grabs you feet and just makes you wanna dance dance dance. this album is so great you'll have the dead rising out of their graves to listen it. and still 20 yrs later it still continues to sell off the shelves. if you don't have this album in your collection then you're missing out an valuable peice of music history.
B000094J5T|5.0|At the beginning of World War II, about four hundred thousand Jews lived in Warsaw, where they represented one-third of the population.  By the end of the war, fewer than twenty-five individuals had survived.  Director Roman Polanski tells the story of one of these men, focusing on how the various atrocities of the Holocaust affected him.  In this sense the film is dramatically different from previous Holocaust films, since it does not attempt to give the \\"big picture,\\" nor does it show how a family or small group of friends supported each other, emotionally, during the war (as does Anne Frank's Diary).  Instead, it focuses on how one artist, a pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), survived hunger, cold, and extreme privation for five years, becoming increasingly more isolated, both emotionally and physically, and increasingly helpless to act, even on his own behalf.<br /><br />Ronald Harwood's screenplay begins with a broad picture of the life of an artistic Jewish family of some means, but as the Nazis issue directive after directive, the family must abandon, first, its possessions, then its home, then its neighborhood, and eventually each other.  This increasingly narrow, inward focus to the film develops extraordinary tension.  Szpilman, once he escapes from the line of prisoners bound for Treblinka, is completely alone, dependent on the help of others--including a handful of sympathetic Gentiles who jeopardize their own lives to hide and feed him--and he never knows from day to day if he will survive till the next day, and sometimes barely cares.  Eventually, late in the war, a German reservist, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann), finds him hiding in an attic, asks him to play Chopin for him, and finally brings him food for several weeks, until the Russians arrive and take the Germans themselves prisoner.<br /><br />Scene after scene tears the viewer apart in this harrowing film, as Szpilman, brilliantly played by Brody, faces one degradation after another by those who refuse to recognize the common humanity among people.  The devastated streets and bleak hiding places, utterly devoid of any human touch, are all filmed with sharp contrasts of light and dark, visually emphasizing the \\"aloneness\\" of Szpilman in Pawel Edelman's stunning cinematography.  The music by Wojciech Kilar furthers the mood without intruding, while the music Szpilman plays by Chopin (Polish) and Beethoven (German) further emphasize the horror of the present.  Showing through the eyes of one man, a pianist, the most heart-rending inhumanity mankind has ever witnessed, Polanski's film leaves the viewer numb with horror.

B0002S94OS|5.0|I have been a metal fan all of my life, but lately I have begun to grow tired of the same old recycled crap. Nothing new was coming out of metal and it was frustrating, so I have begun to stray away from metal, but than all of a sudden, this band Lamb of God comes around and completly blows me away with there first release New American Gospel, an even more on they're second release As The Palaces Burn, and now (in my opinion) they're finest release to day, Ashes of The Wake. This album is a power house of modern oldschool metal, hardcore, and just straight up redneck kickin' your a$$ metal. And if the music wasn't enough to persuade you to like this band, than the lyrics will. They feature many real life issues including our BS political system and our corrupt commander and thief...whoops I mean chief, George Dubya. All in all I'm calling this the best release of 2004 so far. The only reason why I say so far is because in a few weeks Megadeth's new album is coming out. Later!!
B0002IQHZM|5.0|Unexpectedly,Donovan has snuck beneath the music industry radar with a great new CD that invokes and reincarnates the spirit of the Beat poets. Himself a witness to,and participant in,the Beat explosion of the 60's, Donovan taps into that spirit(and it's roots in the 40's and 50's),exhumes it,and incarnates it in the hear and now, bringing us a delightful CD of beat infused jazzy tunes. Like a breath of fresh air, Donovan sings, speaks, and chants to spontaneous rhythms that reach back to the coffehouses of the time and achieves his goal of creating a \\"beat virtual-cafe\\". Wonderfully accompanied by session stalwart,Jim Keltner(who has never sounded so freed up),and Danny Thompson,an acknowledged wizard on stand-up bass,with some B3 organ thrown in for good measure and atmosphere by his producer, John Chelew, Donovan weaves his spell of love songs and mystical ideas which fly in the face of the current musical climate. Resurrecting poems like \\"Two Lovers\\" which hale from that golden age, and adding spot on \\"beat readings\\" of new songs, Donovan breaths new life into that old, nearly forgotten spirit, culminating in a beat dream rendition of Dylan Thomas's poem \\"Do Not Go Gentle\\" ,which serves not only as a sterling example of the Beat's dream of fusing music and poetry, but also serves as a metaphor for these dark times when artists are stifled by the repressive atmosphere of the post 9/11 culture, rife with debates and control over \\"intellectual properties\\". The song serves also as a reminder of Donovan's,and all of our journeys, toward death and aging. In it he rasps like some new age Robert Burns channeling the spirit of the Scottish Bard. While sounding at times almost like rap,and at others invoking the minimalist spirit of Jack Johnson, Donovan,in the liner notes, appeals to younger artists \\"to experiment in the studio, to return to the root sounds\\". He has accomplished this himself, not only returning to his roots, but also sharing the fruits of those roots grown in the soil of experience. This CD is nostalgic in the root sense of the word, a return to a spiritual \\"home\\". Unlike many of his contemporaries,Donovan's voice hasn't lost a thing, his mellow,soothing tones and trademark vibrato are alive and well. For those who have frozen Donovan into some hippie past, this CD should help them to catch up with him in this back-to-the-future release. Because Donovan has been perennially underrated and underheard, this CD should help him gain recognition for his entire body of work, which compares favorably with the best of his contemporaries,and has continued on unbroken since the 60's.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I have long awaited this release on DVD and am so excited to see it FINALLY come out. <br />About 17 years ago this film was on HBO quite a bit, but aired as \\"Warriors of the Wind.\\" HOWEVER this DVD has footage that was originally cut out of the film by the US distributor....20 minutes worth!! <br />A great environmental message, and although it's from way back the film is a masterpiece. If you like it, you should check out the graphic novel that Miyazaki did - it's what the movie is based on! <br />Like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, the central character is a strong woman who fulfills an ancient legend to end all wars and \\"tie the strings of the earth together.\\" <br />A must have for anime fans and environmentalists alike!
0441003257|4.0|Two factors led me to purchase \\"Good Omens\\" several years ago. First, there was a nice phrase on the cover comparing it to \\"Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy\\" (which I covet nicely), and second, Terry Pratchett was a co-author (who's books I've enjoyed previously).  <br /> <br />Then there were several factors that prevented me from reading the book until just a few days ago. First because it was not just written by Pratchett, but also by Gaiman. I don't have anything against Gaiman, but generally speaking, co-authored books tend to flop more often than not. Also I realized that the subject of the book delt with the theme of the apocalypse, which these days is a tired subject and usually turns out lame. Well, I can honestly say that I was wrong about any of my apprihenson.  <br /> <br />The book was a laugh from begining to end and the characters were amusing. <br /> <br />I was impressed with how Gaiman/Pratchett handled religion. They got their laughs from both sides without slipping into mockery or trying to disprove anything. It's all to easy for a non-religious author, when writing about it, to be all superior to the religion, or to take the side of hell. That doesn't happen here. <br /> <br />I would definately think that any fan of humorous fiction would appriciate this book. Uptight Christians may find themselves pointing out certain theological innacuracies or too offended that Crowley (the demon character) isn't demonic enough to enjoy the book, however, on the same hand some Satanists might be offended by certain things, too, so it all evens out.
6305897786|5.0|This is a classic fools tale and while this will seem strange it is best viewed before or after seeing \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" which is also a fools tale and full of the same warmth, depth and fear. <br /> <br />They are both full of archetypes rather than full charactors because that's all they need. EVen the protagnist is more the \\"idea\\" of who he is than the thing. <br /> <br />I always find I am reviewing things that have been covered pretty rhoroughly. It suffices to say, these movies are under watched and under appreciated. They are a kind of erotica where the actual sex is the least necassary thing in them.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is VAN HALEN'S 1978 debut album Van Halen. I remember listening to Eruption for the very first time I was listening to distortion, finger tapping, and most of all Eddie Van Halen. To me it was all classic rock up until this point......I found eddie to be one of rock n roll's greatest guitarist to live, to be inspiring. The music is great on this masterpiece.....yes masterpiece I think this is the best of all of the Van Halen albums. I also loved after eruption when the guitar screamed into You Really Got Me that was cool. But indeed this album is the first and only album that can rock any time of musical fan. If you want the best, you got the best. Enjoy!
B00000I2UC|5.0|Well, I know Jesus & Mary Chain purists might prefer Psychocandy...and it is an awesome album, too. <br /> <br />But to those who say this is \\"overproduced\\"--just remember, without George Martin, there would've been no Beatles' Rubber Soul and without Butch Vig, no Nirvana's Nevermind.  Sometimes helping a band organize its musical genius is a good thing.... <br /> <br />This album stands as an incredible achievement.  The songs are terrific and the playing is sooooo tight.  This might be the UK's finest late-'80s album.  In my mind, this and Doolittle are the two great \\"alternative\\" records of the late '80s.  If you don't have this one, you're in for a treat!
6305177473|5.0|The Parent Trap is an excellent example of what it takes to make a great movie.  A good storyline, decent actors, and a positive sentiment to it.  While it will never be compared with classic films such as Gone With the Wind and Lawrence of Arabia, it is still very impressive.  A fine debut film for Lindsay Lohan, she'll look back on this as a great booster to her career.  She was much more impressive than Hayley Mills was, which is saying a lot.   <br />The storyline orginization was also a vast improvement from the original.  The characters were more scrutinized, which makes it all the better.  In the original, it tooks almost a half-hour before we learned the name of one of the twins!  Pretty pathetic.   <br />The girlfriend in the remake (Meredith) actually looks young, unlike in the original where the girlfriend (Vicki) looked older than the father. <br />The Boston-California connection is pathetic compared to the London-California connection.  As a former Boston resident,I know that the original Parent Trap did a pathetic job in labeling the Boston twin.  Even back in 1961, Boston Brahmins did not come close to resembling her.  The London seen was an improvement.  The Disney producers actually filmed the London scences in London!  And the London twin actually resembled a typical London aristocrat. <br />I also enjoyed the fact that the parents felt sympathetic to the twins in the remake.  In the original, they appeared more cold-hearted and reticent to accept them. <br />While the story is predictable, it is still great.  A nice feel-good film which is a good substitute from bloody, action films.  I recommend it to just about anyone.
1401200605|4.0|If there's one story arc I've kept hearing praise for over the past year, it's \\"Batman:Hush.\\" How it has the most amazing artwork, the best storytelling, and is the product of the best collaboration in Batman comics in years. Not wanting to track down the individual issues or buy the more expensive hardcover, I finally grabbed the trade paperback to see for myself. My verdict? It's a fun read, but there's been better.<br /><br />The problem doesn't lie in either Jim Lee or Jeph Loeb's talents, but rather that the story ends up reading like \\"Batman's Greatest Hits\\", a compilation of favourite villains and cameos without any real purpose. We go from Killer Croc to Catwoman to Poison Ivy, with appearances by Superman, Talia, Alan Scott, Huntress, and Lois Lane. The bad guys have a plan that involve ransoms, mind control, and lots of backstabbing here and there, but its all been done before. Catwoman's romance with Batman? Yep. Superman vs. Batman? Sure. And appearantly there's a bandaged guy named Hush who's working the strings from the shadows, but he shows up so little that he's basically a nonpresence, and doesn't make me excited for part 2.<br /><br />So why am I still giving this 4 stars? The end result may feel kind of rehashed, but the individual components of this book are excellent. Almost every panel of Jim Lee's art could be used for a large-sized poster or trading card. He draws in a way that defines the characters, no matter what stance or angle or pose they're in. And Jeph Loeb, veteran of Long Halloween, Dark Tomorrow, and Smallville writes this fantasy world exactly like you'd want it to sound, with all the right character quirks and dialogue.<br /><br />So it's not exactly the most original read, but it's still an enjoyable read by all means. If you're a Batman fan there are probably other trade paperbacks worth your money, but you should still get around to adding this to your collection.

B00000I8NC|1.0|This CD is only 30 minutes long, which is great for an EP, but over 15 minutes of that time are ruined by some psychotic sociopath going on and on and on about how he hates America, and why it's a \\"third rate, third class, third world country.\\"  His moronic babblings include a stupid fantasy about telling off some judge in court, how American government and authority are part of a great big conspiracy, and a long, awful, cliche poem.   <br /> <br />It doesn't really matter how \\"epic\\" the music is, because this guy overrides and destroys it completely, it's so distracting.   <br /> <br />As it turns out, the band members themselves are extremely anti-American.

B00005AR3G|1.0|Unlike the other reviewers I do not like this Disney film as the main character is not someone you can indentify yourself with. In my opinion the love of the public for the main figure (Pocahontas, Tarzan, Aladdin, Belle, Simba, Nemo, Dorey, etc.) always is the key to the success of the film. In this film I do not have any moment I feel pity of the character or do I really get into the story. Like Lilo and Stitch this is a film very unlike Disney and in my opinion worth to be forgotten very soon. <br />
B00002EPMF|5.0|Hmm, what do we have here? A death metal front man doing a power metal side project? Wait, its not just power metal, but it's progressive and technical as well? It sounds almost too good to be true...right? It's definitely not too good to be true if Chuck Schuldiner is to lead it. <br /> <br />Take the pushy, stick out bass fills along with the highly technical and aggressive guitar sounds of Individual Thought Patterns and combine it with non torpid and speedy trem picking, glabrous melody, and progressive qualities of The Sound of Perseverance and you're about half way there. Chuck decides to repose from the duty of delivering the vocal performance, and picks up Tim Aymar to relay Chuck's lyrics. Tim takes on the \\"classic\\" heavy metal singing style for Control Denied and gives it more edge with his precise high pitched shrieks and screams when appropriate. Tim's screams are suitable for the name of his own band; \\"Psycho Scream.\\" The lyrics on this album are probably the most personal out of all of Chuck's past lyrical work. <br /> <br />The lyrics keep their unique comparisons between emotions and actions among other things, but Chuck has the tendency to compare things like soul and voice, tears and pain, eyes and soul, and other themes from his more recent work with Death repeatedly. There are times that I get the sense that he was running short of ideas for good lyrics without changing his style too much, but at the same time trying his best not to sound repetitive in phraseology. Never the less, the lyrics speak fluently to just about anyone and never erodes once you begin to ponder the meaning behind the message. What this album gives is the erosion of the idea that all power metal sounds the same, which seems to be a problem with most power metal these days. The fast and stand out melody is evidencing the ability of the musicians. <br /> <br />Essentially, this album is impossible to be classified as lackluster; the vitality of the teeth gritting tremlo riffsand change up crashing drumbeats packs a ten-fist punch. The compositional limitations seem to not exist at all. Sure, there are a few minor recursive rhythm riffs, but the fervent nature of this music completely erases any concern of the listener and is almost unnoticeable once you get into it. Album highlights are the songs \\"Consumed,\\" \\"Cut Down,\\" \\"What If..?\\" and \\"When The Link Becomes Missing.\\" If you're a fan of Death and can endure at least a minimal dosage of power metal then this album will most likely please you.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Last Tuesday was such a great day!  I was chomping at the bit to get out of the doctor's office and rush out to buy THE WORLD AT WAR-30th ANNIVERSARY DVD set as soon as I could!  I remember watching every episode as a teenager during the early '90s on A&E and taping each one...so what a great gift to be able to see these commercial-free on DVD!  And, A&E didn't skimp on this set either!  There are 11 discs of pure documentary heaven...and for those who love to study the Third Reich...and the European theater of operations in general....it's pure paradise!  The video comes in crisp and clean...the audio is very sharp.  Sir Laurence Olivier sounds so British...so right...it's great!  Jeremy Issac's documentary will leave you breathless....there is no greater visual history of WWII than this.  Plus, the bonus features on this set are wonderful...over 12 hours of extra documentaries...mostly Euro-and Third Reich-centric...that allow the viewer to expand their minds past what they have seen in the main episodes.  I am so glad that I didn't buy the earlier box set...and waited for this!  It's one of the best documentaries of the 20th Century...all from the British point of view (no American fluff!) and well worth the money.  If you don't believe me, get it and find out for yourself!
B00000720W|5.0|As far as I recall, this was the first Mayhem album I had listened to when I first became curious as to what Mayhem was actually like. I remember from the first listen I was put off by everything about the album and quickly deemed that Mayhem sucked, simply because the poor production style was new to me. How wrong I was. After learning more about black metal in general, I decided to check it out again. At this point, I'm saddened that not many black metal artists are as good as early Mayhem was. <br /> <br />The only thing about the album that kind of put me off was the first track, \\"Silvester Anfang.\\" It's much better to listen to when played live to get the loud and audible properties, but on this album it sounds kind of sloppy. Everything else about this album is no joke - the guitars and riffs are raw, heavy, and crushing. Manheim pounding away on the kit makes it all more enjoyable; because he doesn't just rely on speed...he actually drums very well and offers variety.  There are times where the classic chaotic blast beats are implemented into the mix; adding another splatter of Mayhem's element of wickedness. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this was Maniac's best vocal work with Mayhem. His screams of despair fit the atmosphere of the music more than on any other Mayhem album. Maniac's gut puking screams suck you in and it's damn near scary how he can make the music very emotional and creepy with his wailing cries. Necrobutcher's bass is extremely fuzzy and heavily distorted, and surprisingly, its presence is shown immensely. It's kind of hard to catch at certain fast points due to the sub-par production, but for the majority the thick pummeling sound stands out very well. <br /> <br />The other thing I didn't like was the short track list. I realize this is an EP, but I wish there had been more on this album. The catchy parts of this album seem more revolved around chunk riffing than fast paced semi-thrash riffs. It's got its pernicious and speed parts, but I find the chunky parts to be much more enjoyable. The influence of Venom shows highly, and not just in the cover of the song \\"Witching Hour.\\"  Songs like \\"Deathcrush,\\" \\"Necrolust,\\" and \\"Pure F***ing Armageddon\\" show definite signs of thrash influence with fast (yet simple) tremolo picking. <br /> <br />Euronymous makes it all work nicely, actually. For such poor production it still manages to offer a strong, desolate, and enjoyable experience. I'd recommend it to any and all true black metal fans who can appreciate real old school black metal. I kind of wish Maniac would use the same vocal style he used on Deathcrush on all other Mayhem albums he was on, because I think Deathcrush is his best vocal work. This is an important piece of black metal history; obtain this brutal and primitive EP whenever you can.
B0002I831S|5.0|The packaging alone is worth the price of admission!  The case opens up to reveal the special book with the episode list and 8 pictured DVDs...all just ready to pop into your player at the first chance!  I find it really fitting that \\"Scotty\\" would get his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame the same day that this would be released.  What a fitting tribute to a man who played a piviotal role in one of American pop culture's most enduring television franchises.  The price may be a bit steep to some, but after you experience the packaging, you will definitely be hooked!
B000003C2U|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I was a bit skeptical and more partial to Death's newer material than the older. However, after blasting this album in my car, I was stunned with awe. Then I realized why this album had received such high praise. This was a turning point for Chuck Schuldiner and Death. Human was Death's first effort to deliver speed, technicality, heaviness, and melody...and they succeeded!<br /><br />It seems Chuck has matured with his lyrics, while his brutal death metal vocals remain the same. The guitar riffs aren`t the most complex, but this is still a fairly large step for Death and they still manage to make unique tunes that actually sound good. The guitars have a raw and thick sound with a dosage of melody. Although Steve DiGiorgio is an awesome bassist his bass sounds like total crap in some parts of this album. Listen at around 0:24 into the song \\"Suicide Machine\\" and you hear what sounds like a rubber band, but it is supposed to be Steve's bass.<br /><br />The drumming is rather burly sounding; nice and thick. Sean proves himself a worthy drummer as you listen to the dismal drums which take you into \\"Flattening of Emotions,\\" as well as \\"Together As One\\". Paul shows that he can fill the shoes of metal guitar guru - James Murphy by playing his parts with obvious ease. It sure was nice for the members of Cynic to lend out their two best men. Yet again, Chuck shows that unless the line up is perfect, it doesn't fly.<br /><br />Most of the songs are fast, with the exception of the beautifully welded instrumental - \\"Cosmic Sea,\\" which more than makes up for lack of speed with carefully placed rhythm and humming melodies. There is even a quick little bass solo in this instrumental. This is a nice fresh listen - it contains expeditious speed, heaviness, with a nice dab of melody while keeping intelligent and unique lyrics in constant presence. Sad enough, music isn't made like this much these days. This is one of the album I own that I can listen to all the way through without the desire to skip any tracks.<br /><br />At this point in time, this was a huge step of advancement in Death's existence. I would go as far to say that this album is a classic and should be owned by any and all death metal lovers. Hurry up and buy it if you don't own it yet.
B0002S94OS|4.0|I'll start out by saying that New American Gospel is a fantastic cd.  One of my favorite metal cds, all genres included (death, grind, tech, heavy, power, etc.) It stood out from the pack of rising metal bands that were gaining national recognition because it took an age-old genre of metal--the thrash/hardcore combo that reminds me of slayer/pantera but with a heavier groove--and took that age-old genre to a new level.  After New American Gospel came As the Palaces Burn.  Many of the songs are solid in writing, but the recording was lacking the heavy pulvarizing sound found on NAG.  Now we come to full length number three- Ashes of the Wake. I would have given it 4.5 stars since I don't hand out five stars unless some ground has been broken.  The cd is playing as I write this, and first off I notice that it has about as perfect as a recording as you could ask for LOG's style of music.  Everyband has a sound of recording that perfectly fits them and while most bands never find that recording sound, LOG has found it for Ashes of the Wake.  The drums sound full and perfectly audible at every hit of the stick.  The bass is just audible enough to fuel the groove that makes LOG stand on their own, holding down a tight rhythm as the guitars chug over head.  <br />There's nothing new on the vocal front, but thats fine with me; the growling lows and shrieking highs are still there.  Over all the song writing is tight and moves between faster thrash parts to rather complex rhythmic breakdowns that have a certain bounce or, as mentioned earlier, groove to them.  This cd has restored my faith in LoG, faith that was lost after New American Gospel.
B000066NW0|5.0|I want to believe Avril when she claims that she wants to be anything but ordinary, really I do, but hers is a rather ordinary sentiment after all. If she really means it, and isn't just being petulant and trying to fake everyone out, I would suggest that she throw out the guitars, toss the keyboards, ditch the samplers and unboot the ProTools that she and all her like-minded musical peers use and that she get herself to a nunnery or something truly radical like that. But guess what? As it is, we have her debut CD instead. It's full of very ordinary, radio-friendly hard pop and replete with lines like the Sartrean 'Uh-huh, life's like this'; the truly radical 'We rock each other's world'; and the Perennially Unanswered Question, 'Is it enough to die?' (I think Jesus beat you to that one, Avril). Diamanda Galas she ain't. Heck, she even mis-spells 'Skater Boy' on purpose, just like any ordinary teenager. Being unordinary just isn't all that complicated. She's certainly right about one thing, though . . . 'It's all been done before.'
B00005JNEI|5.0|I really don't take Michael Moore that seriously.  It's not that I think he's a clown.  I just don't get worked about him either way.  So I went to see \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" out of curiousity, not because of politics.  I was really drawn into the first half of the film.  I don't know how much validity to give to Moore's claims of Saudi connections to the Bushes, but it makes for a compelling conspiracy film.  The second half has more emotional impact, but gets a little scattered since Moore is no longer telling a story that ads up to something.  The very last 3 or 4 minutes are really strong.  Overall, I recommend checking out \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" even if you like Pres. Bush.
B000003S28|3.0|My First 2 Eno albums were \\"Plateux Of Mirror 2 (Harold Budd)\\" and \\"Music For Airports\\". Both of which have become soundtracks of my life. Actually one of my favorite songs is \\"Not Yet Remembered\\". It has been with me through so much, and I still listen to it and get a whole range of emotions. I even purchased Harold Budd albums as  a spinoff from this album.<br />I actually heard \\"Music For Airports\\" as background music in the movie \\"Nine and 1/2 Weeks\\", looked it up in the  film credits,  and ran out to buy that album, which I also love and still listen to. I decided to explore more of Brian Eno, as I desired new songs and new experiences. So, my 3rd Eno album is \\"Music For Films\\". I am not at all impressed , yet. I realize it was recorded in 1978, but some of the songs sound so cheap, like a casio tone keyboard. Or remind me of music from the \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" film. The spacy noises sound too seventies. All I am saying is that it sounds dated. I am sure it will grow on me, and perhaps this review is premature, but I don't see this album being a \\"staple\\" in my life as the other 2 have been. This album isn't so much musical, I wouldn't even call the tracks \\"songs\\",it can be described more as \\"sound effects\\".<br />Yet, I am not giving up, I am going to buy buy more Eno albums. I am sure there is another gem out there.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I am always surprised by what a gentleman Mr. Moore presents himself as when interviewed.  Heck, I'd almost be willing to break bread with him if given the chance.  Given that I have familial Hollywood connections, it's certainly not out of the question.  I've been trying to contact Mr. Moore for an interview to appear in my company newsletter. <br /> <br />Of course, much of the controversy surrounding Michael Moore and his films is due to the questionable status of his citizenship.  I don't want to rehash the topic, as talk radio hosts have debated it to death.  But whether or not he is able to legally work within the U.S. is neither here nor there.  We know he lives in the States, and therefore he poses a danger to the country.   <br /> <br />The single-star rating is applicable if his film is taken as a serious documentary.  As a fantasy/comedy film, I'd give it four billion stars.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|\\"Under My Skin\\" is way better than her last album, \\"Let Go\\". I'm not saying Let Go was bad, but sometimes u tend to get sick of it. I've been listening to Under My Skin again and again and again, and I'm not prepared to stop listening. Some of them are 'typical Avril', like 'Take Me Away', 'My Happy Ending' etc. But we get a new taste of her from songs like 'How Does It Feel', 'Nobody's Home', 'Slipped Away'--softer than her usual ditch-the-guy lyrics. It's a great combination. I definitely prefer Under My Skin over Let Go.

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|The delightful thing about Gilmore Girls is that it relies on nothing but its own merits to be positively the best show on television.  With incredibly loveable characters whose relationships make you long to live in a small town, Gilmore Girls takes you to a realistic world that could only exist in your fondest dreams.  It's plots and characterization rival any of the \\"best\\" on television, and its charming wit brings to mind the word play and subtlety of a Jane Austen novel.  There is never a dull moment when you are watching the diaglogue-driven lives of two of the most interesting and eccentric women on TV.  The mother-daughter relationship between Lorelai and Rory may not be typical, but every mother and daughter certainly wishes it were.  The dynamic of the town is at the same time frantic and refreshing, all of the unique characters blending to make an incredible ensemble.  The acting is superb, never missing a beat and is the backbone of what makes this show amazing.  If you delight in dialogue and characters that make you think, feel, and laugh yourself silly--then this is the dvd collection for you.

B00000J7A2|4.0|More than likely, if you haven't heard anything by the good Cap before, this album will rock your world.  Taken in isolation, it holds up as one of the most ear-catching, innovative, and well-written albums of the sixties.  Further, it is the most accessible work in Beefheart's oeuvre. <br /> <br />But coming to this album after listening to (not to mention being amazed, amused, excited and enthralled by) Trout Mask Replica, I got the sense of an artist still very much influenced by the musical trends of the time, trying to find his own way.  He seems to be putting his own (albeit unique and twisted) spin on various musical styles, without having yet realized \\"that Beefheart groove\\", a jones that I can honestly say you will not find anywhere else. <br /> <br />Essentially, this is a great album for anyone who wants to experience some singular, hard-rockin, blues influenced psych-rock; think the Nuggets compilation with better songwriting and a greater sense of adventure.  However, looking back, it's hard not to see \\"Safe As Milk\\" as anything but a precursor for what was to come: the genre-defying, head-exploding genius of \\"Trout Mask Replica\\", and its follow-up, the even better, currently deleted (sigh) \\"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\\". <br /> <br />Being a man who listens to a lot of music, I tend to get desensitized to anything that doesn't bowl me over.  If something is merely good (and even THAT doesn't happen very often), it's unlikely I'll pick it up or even listen to it again.  But when I hear something truly fantastic, I usually start laughing out of sheer musical ecstasy.  When I heard \\"Safe As Milk\\", I smiled and bought it.  But from the moment I heard the first song from \\"Trout Mask\\", I laughed 'til my sides hurt.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00002E233|3.0|Probably the pick of the Jaws style thrillers that remerged a few years back, attempting to capture the suspense of the Shark flick, with more inventive special effects.<br /><br />The movie sports a pretty good cast, including Samuel L Jackson as a rich investor, and Saffron Burrows as the hard nosed and dedicated physician attempting to find a cure for Alzheimer's by using Shark brain fluid. Sounds cheesy, but the plot actually supports itself quite well and is at least plausible, if a little improbable. The story centers around an isolated marine facility with a skeleton crew that you just know are going to get into problems, and sure enough the picture moves quickly into an escape adventure, when the hunters (or scientists) become the hunted. Another complaint is the casting: the director seems to have felt the need to cover all the bases with stereotype characters, which really wasn't necessary.<br /><br />* The aging and unkempt heavy smoking scientist<br /><br />* The sexy young, ruthless bossy woman<br /><br />* The religious guy<br /><br />* The handsome hunky hero with a shady past<br /><br />* The successful financial investor, who's also athletic and a born leader<br /><br />* The soft spoken other female with an active but sensitive side<br /><br />* The brainy guy who's a bit of a wimp, but comes through in a clutch<br /><br />This is no Jaws however, with none of the grace or depth of the Spielberg classic, and spends far too much time trying to wow the audience with the ferociousness of the initially caged lab experiments. After they get loose we are treated to some gory attack scenes but this is where the movie really suffers. Watching this on the small screen really shows up the CGI and at times the sharks looks so fake, they almost appear as cartoons. Lightning fast attack sequences don't help this either, and the whole thing starts to look very artificial.<br /><br />This isn't a BAD picture, and there are one or two twists in the plot, and scenes to make you jump which help lift the story in places, but it is WAY TOOOOO predictable overall.<br /><br />Worth a look, but you probably won't pause it while you put the popcorn on! Enjoythe story in places, but it is WAY TOOOOO predictable overall. <br />Worth a look, but you probably won't pause it while you put the popcorn on! Enjoy <br />

B000001FCB|5.0|In the book \\"Furacao Elis\\" the author writes about the difficulty between Tom and Elis in recording this album, as both ideas of what the album should be, differed radically. Through the anger and joy in finding a collective idea as to what direction the album should be moving in, one can hear the range of emotions in each of the artist's voices. Elis Regina and Tom Jobim's \\"Aguas De Marco\\" is with all sincerity the most truly emotional and unpretentiously sophisticated song I have ever heard in my life, and for this it continues to be, in my opinion, the greatest work not only of Jobim, but of any of his contemporaries. <br />--Taylor
B0002CTSW2|1.0|I just made Mel Gibson richer (again) today by buying this stupidest of films ... South Park's &quot;The Passion of the Jew&quot; (which I also bought) is much better -- it's more honest, truthful and, yes, inspirational and godly.
6304698526|4.0|What a tragedy it was the day in 1980 we lost Steve McQueen at age 50.  To those who don't remember what a huge star Hollywood's \\"King of Cool\\" was, think what a shock it would be if in just five years Tom Cruise died of cancer.  THAT is how big McQueen was, and kids today don't even know his name.  For those who are curious, I recommend three films:  1972's \\"The Getaway,\\" 1963's \\"The Great Escape,\\" and the film that formed the cornerstone of his reputation, 1968's \\"Bullitt.\\"    Actually, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and \\"Lethal Weapon\\" fans may be disappointed since \\"Bullitt\\" is not so much an action thriller as a police procedural and character study centering on Frank Bullitt (McQueen), a laconic, lone-wolf police detective.  Bullitt and his partners are chosen by their superiors to protect a mob witness who is due to testify in a high-profile criminal trial that an ambitious politician named Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) has staked his reputation and career on.  Unfortunately, Bullitt's team is set up and the witness and partners are shot and left for dead.  Bullitt is then left to figure out what happened, all while being stalked by a steely gray-haired [...] and his accomplice.    The centerpiece of \\"Bullitt\\"'s reputation, along with McQueen's legendary performance, is a hair-raising, high-octane car chase between Bullitt and the assassins through the streets of San Francisco that lasts nearly 20 minutes of screen time.  So famous and so expertly was this sequence staged that the film won an Oscar for film editing even though it received only one other minor nomination (for Best Sound), which is almost unheard of.  There is also an exciting chase and shootout across the runways of San Francisco International Airport that ends the film, but other than that action enthusiasts may be disappointed.  However, those who like stories that actually make sense, have characters that are believable everymen and not just superhuman killing machines and feature action sequences that serve the plot and are not just tacked on to top everything that has come before will love this film.    The performances are uniformly expert, with standouts including Norman Fell and Simon Oakland as Bullitt's no-nonsense superiors, Georg Stanford Brown as a doctor, and John Aprea as the nearly mute, hair-raising [...].  Vaughn is a worthwhile adversary as a politician who (surprise!) is ambitious to the point he can't be trusted, and Jacqueline Bisset has a few touching scenes as Bullitt's sensitive girlfriend who has a hard time reconciling the quiet man she loves with the policeman who is so jaded he can look at a young female murder victim and not be moved in the least.  And watch for Robert Duvall as a cab driver and Joanna Cassidy in a blink-and-you'll miss her bit.    But this is McQueen's film the entire way and he is absolutely legendary in a role that, along with Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle in \\"The French Connection\\" and Clint Eastwood's \\"Dirty Harry\\" Callahan, created the modern screen image of the iconic, tough police officer.  My guess is he has maybe fifty lines in the entire movie, but when he does talk, he wastes no words and every steely stare speaks volumes.  And did I mention his chief support is the coolest automobile in screen history, a green 1968 Ford Mustang, which is almost as memorable as the character of Bullitt himself?    In addition, McQueen is aided immeasurable by Peter Yates' expert direction and the rock-solid script, which substitute thrills with unyielding realism.  The photography and music are stellar, and the editing, well, as I said before, is Oscar-winning.      In all, \\"Bullitt\\" is one legendary film that has aged well, still looks great after 36 years and remains thrilling to this day.  Serious film and action fans will not be bored, although thrill-seekers might.  As for the DVD, it's a good, though not great package that is presented in its original 1:85:1 aspect ratio.  In all, its a great introduction to a true movie star who deserves to be rediscovered by future generations of film fans.  **** (out of *****)
B00020HB7S|4.0|Sometimes there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the combinations of movies they come up with in these 2-packs but with \\"Mullholland Drive\\" and \\"Swimming Pool\\" they came up with a quirky combo.  If you do not like David Lynch and those who make movies in that mold then you should know that going in and can just avoid these two.  But if you like quirky films that force you to think to figure out what the hell just happened in a movie, then this is a well-suited pair.<br /><br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\"  is written and directed by David Lynch and is certainly more style than substance, with Lynch creating his more surrealistic film yet. There might be those who think that this is some sort of film noir because there is a scene where a couple of hard-boiled cops show up and spout film noir type dialogue. But there are bits and pieces of different film genres throughout the film, which is another clue to the tapestry of Lynch's tale.  When the second main character in the drama, Betty (Naomi Watts), gets off the plane in Hollywood ready to pursue her quest to become a star, it never dawned on me that there was more to the kindly old couple that wishes her well and drive off in a limosine. Betty moves into an apartment, only to discover Rita, who has apparently suffered amnesia after her near death experiences, taking a shower. Betty is from Canada, so she opts for helping Rita rather than calling the police. The two become friends and more than friends in a couple of the best sex scenes seen in a movie in the last decade (they also serve to underscore how unsexy most sex scenes are in movies today).<br /><br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\" is a movie about Hollywood, or more appropriately the dream of Hollywood. It means something that Rita, who does remember her real name, pulls the one she uses from a movie poster for \\"Gilda.\\" Betty is the plucky young kids from the sticks who wants to be a star. The unwritten rule about such people is that they would do anything to achieve their dream and in a sense Lynch's film just flips the dream over and looks at the nightmare side of the equation. However, I have no problem with the idea that for many of those who watch this film that \\"Muholland Drive\\" will not come close to making sense to them until the second time they see it and that many of those people are not going to make the effort. For those of us who have seen Lynch's other films, most notably \\"Eraserhead\\" and \\"Blue Velvet,\\" we knew going in that was probably going to be necessary. I mean, come on. This is David Lynch people. What did you expect?<br /><br />As for \\"Swimming Pool,\\" I would say that it is more sensual than it is erotic, although ultimately the nudity in this film is secondary to the story. Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is a British writer of crime fiction who apparently find no joy in her writing, her popularity, her publisher, or any the idea that any other writer might be writing something worth reading as well. Everyone is waiting for the next installment about her detective and she in uninspired. So her publisher (Charles Dance) offers her the use of his villa in France as a place where she can retreat and come up with a new book. Once there Sarah explores the house, taking notice of the leaf covered swimming pool in back. She also begins to write, and although we have no idea what she is writing about, Sarah seems productive and happy.<br /><br />Then Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), the daughter of her publisher shows up as an unexpected guest.  Not only because Sarah assumed she would be alone, but because she did not know he had a daughter. If anything, Sarah has been waiting for him to show up so that she can get in a little relaxation with her rest. Instead Julie shows up and violates not only Sarah's privacy but here sense of propriety. Julie tends walk around topless by the pool and apparently shows no sense of discrimination in bringing home men to sleep with. We know Sarah disapproves of such practices, but this does not stop her from watching Julie, whether she is swimming in the villa's pool or making love to some strange man. It then becomes clear that not only is Julie becoming a part of Sarah's novel, but that something is going to happen.<br /><br />\\"Swimming Pool\\" is usually described as being a thriller, but that strikes me as being off the mark. It is more of a mystery, but in a subtle way, which explains why it is difficult to talk about director François Ozon's film without giving away too much. This is the sort of film where you are going to have to go back and at least watch the end of the film again, if not the entire thing from start to finish (just like with \\"Mulholland Drive\\"), to make sure you understand what happened. What helped me out in untangling this film was that for most of it I kept asking what Sarah was writing. There was clearly a connection between what was happening and what Sarah was writing, but I kept waiting for Ozon to show us what that was, which, in the end, only goes to show how much I was fooled by this film. In this regard the film ends up being surprising rather than shocking, in keeping with the subtlety and sensuality of the film.<br /><br />Although they are both quirky films they are certainly odd in decidedly different ways and it will be interesting to see which of these two you end up preferring.  The last piece of advice is not to watch them the same week (watching them back to back would do incredibly weird things to your brain).whether she is swimming in the villa's pool or making love to some strange man.

B00005JLR8|5.0|It seems like most people don't realize that this story is based on true events. <br />This is the best DVD I've seen this year. The acting is just phenomenal and you'll remember the story for the rest of your life. <br />The story is about a an Irish family that moves into the U.S. illegally and starts off with literally nothing They find a rundown apart building and live there. What is remarkable about the film is the family's ability to make the best out of what they have. There are moments of laughter, pain, joy, and grief. The characters are absolutely unforgettable.  <br />This is a great film.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|<br /> <br />Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have finally done it. This movie surprised me from beginning to end. I would have never expected Russell Crowe to give this kind of performance. I'm glad Ron Howard has finally shown his dark side. What I really noticed about this film, thinking about the effect of emotion on eye color, was that Russell's eye color changed from green to blue in some scenes. <br /> <br />Ron Howard has shown me that his directing is comparable to Frances Ford Coppola's and Martin Scorsese's. The two roles that Russell Crowe played in The Insider and A Beautiful Mind completely top his Oscar winning role in Gladiator. I loved Jennifer Connely's acting in this movie and the chemistry between Russell and Jennifer was electrifying. People who've said Russell is a one note actor will have a different opinion after seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I think Russell Crowe's acting in this film is comparable to my favorites, Marlon Brando and Robert Deniro. I believe there has never been a method actor who has demonstrated such gifted acting as Russell Crowe in this film \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\"  <br /> <br />Russell Crowe reminds me of Deniro a lot because of the intensity and sensitive emotion's they both show when acting. Russell gives us a different picture of mental illness when he portrays this geeky, shy, arrogant Dr. Nash. I think this movie is an original movie about an original man, the brilliant genius John Forbes Nash Jr. He is trying to find his original idea and on the way he falls in love with his future wife Alicia, becomes schizophrenic, and begins his long journey to the discovery of a lifetime and what Really matters in life. <br /> <br />
B00005MAM2|5.0|There aren't enough words to describe this incredible film . The directing is unbelievable; the acting, the soundtrack, and of course the animation is great. One reason why I love this movie, is the message it delivers to the audience. The message is how pathetic we really are, politics, war, riots, we are pathetic creatures. Another reason I like this film is that it's the first animated movie to question our existence. <br /> <br />I didn't enjoy \\"Ghost In The Shell\\" as much as \\"Akira\\" because \\"Ghost In The Shell\\" tried to give out that same message, but it the message had been shown in \\"Akira.\\" Don't get me wrong I love \\"Ghost in the Shell.\\" I enjoyed the awesome, advanced 3d visual effects, and lot's it references to the Bible. Also the story was good but it was to short. If you see \\"Akira\\" do not see \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" unless you're tempted like I was to see both. I like films that give a true message through hard hitting action scenes not just through Bible references. Katsuhiro Otomo is a great director and has made a true animated epic. In fact, forget that it's an animated film; it's one of the greatest films ever made in the last 60 years. <br /> <br />
B00003CXXP|5.0|The thing that I find spectacular about this movie is the directing, and the acting between Haley and Law. The reason why this movie is a combination of Spielberg and Kubrick is it's humor and it's message about the dark and stupid side of the human race. I'll tell you some parts about the movie that make me feel this way. Remember that scene with Jude Law when he's dancing around and the scene when he tells this woman \\"Once you have a Meca inside of you, you will never want a real man again\\". Or the scene when his mom is about to die and Haley starts to cry. Steven is showing us that Haley has become human again after 2,000 years because Mecas can't cry. And if Haley's become human that means he's the one human left alive because the Human race was destroyed. Spielberg loves the Human race unlike Kubrick. This particular scene is a Spielberg idea. <br /> <br />Now here's the Darkside of the movie. Remember little evil Martin and the evil dad who wanted to get rid of Haley, or when Law told Haley that the world changed and made everything worse starting with Manhattan, or when Mecas where being hunted and destroyed by Humans, and the aliens roamed a frozen Earth; all this was Kubrick's brilliant idea for the Human race. <br /> <br />I don't want to offend, but anyone who thinks or says that those aliens in the movie were evolved Mecas are just plain ignorant. Spielberg tells you what they are (aliens) right there in a scene when one of the aliens actually tells Haley where, why, and what's, their purpose for coming to Earth.  <br /> <br />This is one of the best classical movies ever made in the 21st century and in the last 50 years. And it's not as sad an ending as you might think. I know people may not get it, but what's not to get. The message is right there in front of you. Spielberg and Kubrick are telling us to slow down on our evolvement because if we create a being using Artificial Intelligence then maybe it will think bad thoughts and may become like a dictator and start a revolution against us, or maybe the Human race will become enraged and start a Meca Holocaust like in the Movie. Who knows what will happen. <br /> <br />
B00003CXXM|4.0|The acting is good, but the directing didn't inspire me. The story has been done countless times, what makes this film so special is Matt Damon's acting. At times when you feel bored and want to walk out of the theater, Matt Damon gives you a surprise, he's actually acting. He adds demension to his character and some vulnerability. The dialogue isn't that bad, but it isn't in the category of \\"Pulp Fiction\\", or \\"Goodfellas.\\" This is way better than the sequal, and I didn't fall asleep, so I recommend \\"The Bourne Identitiy.\\"
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The Coppola saga hasn't ended yet. Sofia Coppola is a genius, she's not as aggressive as her father, she's swewet, she's gentle, and mostly about business. Sofia Coppola's  best film was \\"The Virgin Suicides\\", which was overlooked.  <br /> <br />The way I heard about \\"Lost In Translation\\" was my favorite critic Roger Ebert who quoted: This is Bill Murray's best dramatic performance. I said \\"Bill Murray doing a drama, well I'm pretty shocked.\\" Murray has never done a great dramatic performance until now, he made me cry, he made me laugh, and made me cry some more. This is agreat film, and I can write a sonnet about Scarlet Johanssen. I love this film.
B00005JL78|5.0|Which is a better film, \\"Minority Report\\" or \\"Blade Runner?\\" I believe that \\"Minority Report,\\"is why, because of the plot. \\"Blade Runner\\" focused more on 3D effects than on the human story. What I love about \\"Blade Runner\\" is the vision of the future and the settings that were both dark and somber. \\"Minority Report\\" is also a dark and yet beautiful film. But I have to give credit to \\"Metropolis\\"(1925), the first and best SCI-FI film ever.    \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Dark City,\\" and \\"The Fifth Element\\" would have never been created without the inspiration of Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis.\\"    THE PLOT    In The Year 2054, a so-called \\"pre-crime division\\" is working busily around Washington, DC. It's purpose is to use the precog(native) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. Author, Dashielle, and Agatha (Samantha Morton), whose power is the strongest of the three. When the three precogs, who only work together, floating in what the police call the Temple, have a vision the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time that it will happen, are given out to these special police who then try to prevent the crime from happening.    Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, \\"Minority Report\\" is about a cop name John Anderton (Tom Cruise). John has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future murder, and he must investigate the circumstances of this murder and prevent it before it is too late.    *****SPOILERS AHEAD*****    The film examines the political and ethical dilemma of arresting a person before the crime is committed. The project of pre-crime prevention is having it's first trial run, and the citizens of the city will vote on it in the next election. If the people vote it in as law the crime rate will drop drastically, but it is unknown whether innocent people might be imprisoned.    (...)    THE DIRECTING    There's a scene that most directors call a two-face-shot but Samantha Morton and Tom Cruise are facing the opposite direction. The two actors chins lay on each other's shoulders, as if almost hugging each other. Then Spielberg takes the camera and places it on the right side of Tom body and captures the two face shot. Tom's face and Samantha's eye's and mouth portray a very powerful scene. Another shot that I call the \\"Taxi Driver\\" shot is when Spielberg trails the camera on the roof of the peoples apartment, showing the spiders identifying the people. These days that scene would be digital but Spielberg never uses 3D unless he has too. Spielberg directs his films in a new yet classical way.    THE ACTORS    Samantha Morton's face conveys total fear and total authority. She received an Oscar nomination for her role as the mute girlfriend in Woody Allen's \\"Sweet and Lowdown.\\" Tom Cruise didn't get nominated for his breakthrough performance in \\"Vanilla Sky,\\" shame on the Academy. Tom did receive a Golden Globe for \\"Magnolia\\" and 3 Academy Award nominations for the following films, \\"Born on The Forth of July\\", \\"Jerry Maguire\\" and \\"Magnolia.\\" Collin Farrell delivers his best performance in this movie to date.    There is a mental love story portrayed between Agatha and John. They've both been scarred deeply in the past and fate brings them together at this crucial time in John's life to solve this mystery. The film ends with Agatha sitting in a chair thinking about both her mother and John.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Interview with a Vampire is actually one of the best films of the decade. Brad Pitt probably gave the best performance of his career. Brad showed the pain and the rage of Louis. Tom Cruise was excellent as the handsome lonely Lestat. Antonio Banderas was scary as Armond. And Kirsten Dunst was great as Claudia, she acted like a woman in a little girls body. <br /> <br />This film shows that Vampires aren't blood sucking animals,they have emotions and a soul. Ann Rice puts you in this world and makes you think, what if you could get a Vampire to sit and tell you the story of his life. Neil Jordan's directing was hypnotic and so was the acting. Brad and Tom should have been nominated for an Oscar and I'm glad this film got the Oscar for best original score. I love this movie and I hope it will be seen and loved by many in the future. <br />
B0001EFTS8|5.0|\\"Metropolis\\" spawned \\"Blase Runner\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"The Fifth Element\\", \\"Dark City\\", and \\"The Matrix.\\" This is one of the best Sci Fi films ever. It was original, and has incredible acting. This is a great film, I recommend it to anybody. Remember people, this film came out in the 1920's, so not everything looks great, but if you can get past the fact that the visual don't look so great, then this will be a treat.
B00005JN2F|3.0|\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is definitly not as good as the first one. Who ever watches this film will go to sleep. I like the film, I like the fact that I get to more about Bourne than I wanted to. But this is just a BORING FILM. I'm kinda dissapointed, but I still recommend it. I hope the third installment is better.
B00028HBKM|2.0|In many films, the writer and/or director presents characters and the story the way he/she sees it. This is certainly the case with Mel Gibson. Mel wishes himself he were Jesus, and after making this movie he has definitely received the acclamation he desired.  <br />I thought the cinematography was good. The stars are for that and the acting. The story was boring, and it was non-stop blood and violence. This film made me even more sickened by religion and what it has done to people. For those who believe and blame Jews for the death of Jesus, you wouldn't have your precious Christ if it was not for them. So you should be thanking them for it instead of throwing stones. Anyways, I don't believe the story was accurate at all, and according to history,NOT THE BIBLE- Pilate was malicious and not at all sympathetic and forgiving as Mel made him out to be in the film. The Romans had the control here-not the Jews. I think this film wrongfully portrayed the Jews as being in control-having authority, and being murderers-WOW! A totally anti-Jewish  \\"Jews control the world\\" viewpoint (which is totally fabricated).  <br />I believe wholeheartedly in freedom of speech-and Mel is entitled to do whatever he wants in his films-but that does not mean I have to like it. What I find completely contradictory of Fundamentalist Christians is that they will go to lengths to condemn violence in films-and yet this film, is considered a masterpiece. What hypocrisy! Get over yourselves!
B00006BTCA|4.0|The comparisons to Joy Division have been legion, and while I see the analogy, these guys are not quite as gloomy nor anywhere as Gothic. (And the Psychedelic Furs -- those talentless twerps? Hardly worth remembering, much less mentioning in the same breath as this.) But what I hear (and I bet I catch hell for this) are echoes of REM's very first (1981) EP, \\"Chronic Town\\": mumbled lyrics (before Stipe caught Bono-messiah disease); jangly, hypnotic guitars; dense, interwoven rhythms. Not esp. catchy the first time around, but it grows on you and then won't let go.
B0002DB50E|4.0|VIDEODROME is finally getting some respect after all these years.  True, it is extremely bizarre and one viewing will never answer all the questions that it puts forth, but it is an incredibly ground breaking film that deserves multiple viewings.  And what better way to get back to the movie than with this stunning 2 disc release.  The DVD presentation looks great.  Unfortunately there is no 5.1 sound option, but this is a minor flaw.   <br />The major flaw for me is the fact that there are no deleted scenes.  This set is loaded with extras, including a still gallery of deleted scenes, but I was so looking forward to actually seeing them in action.  For years I've seen photos of Deborah Harry & James Woods in scenes that never appeared in the film.  The original VHS release even had one of these pics on it's back cover.    Then came the SCI-FI Channel version of the film that did include some of the deleted scenes but still left out several others.  When I heard Criterion was releasing this, I thought for sure they'd at least be featured in the Extras section, but they are not.  Even with that complaint, I assure any one interested in this set that it is worth every penny.  The extras that you do get are amazing.  There are three awesome trailers, a making of featurette from 1982, two new mini-documentaries on the film, bootleg videos of the tapes that play on the televisions in the actual movie itself (\\"Samurai Dreams\\" & the Videodrome transmissions), commentaries by James Woods, Deborah Harry, & David Cronenberg, and the awesome roundtable discussion called \\"Fear On Film\\" which features Cronenberg, John Carpenter, & John Landis on a 1980's talk show.  Any fan of this film will not be disappointed in this collection.   <br />
B00003CXCT|2.0|If you don't understand the immense importance of that half-second event, then you aren't into Star Wars for the right reason. To you, it's just a movie. Fine. Take your \\"movie\\" and enjoy it. But to those who aren't so easily sedated, whose standards aren't so low, who want to embrace every ounce of the true storyline and the true essences of the characters, it is blasphemy to alter it. <br />Completely neutering Han Solo's personality into a full-blown \\"good guy\\" who only fires when fired upon is just wrong. <br />It's candifying the story so kids don't get the impression that it's cool to shoot first. George Lucas has wimped out, and as evident in the newest films is trying to turn this series even more into children's entertainment, which has irretrievably damaged the entire experience. <br />I have my original videos and I'll be happy to stick with them, thank you very much. <br />
B0000019PA|5.0|Jeff Mangum is the King of Carrot Flowers. Or at least, the king of his own brand of innocently psychedelic dream-rock. The second full-length album from the endearingly weird Neutral Milk Hotel is not as lo-fi as \\"From Avery Island,\\" but its beauty and dreaminess are still untouched.<br /><br /> Steady guitar strums start off \\"The King of Carrot Flowers Part 1,\\" before blossoming into the eerie, spirituality-themed \\"King of Carrot Flowers Part 2 & 3.\\" Following it up the somehow inspiring \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea,\\" the grim trumpeting of \\"The Fool,\\" and the rousing folky-carnival bombast of \\"Holland, 1945.\\"<br /><br /> Crickets, screams and a gentle guitar melody start \\"Communist Daughter,\\" followed by the wailing \\"Oh Comely,\\" magnificently fuzzy \\"Ghost,\\" and the eerie tenth track, which doesn't have a title -- a catchy, indescribable mix of fuzz guitar and funhouse melodies. The album ends on a strong note with \\"Two Headed Boy Part 2,\\" with its haunted-house opener woven out of horns, which melts away behind Mangum's final ballad.<br /><br /> Neutral Milk Hotel is one of those bands that will steal your heart, or send you howling from the room. There's no middle ground. It's an acid-tinged dream of spirituality, sex, chaos, rebirth and beauty, full of girls with roses in their eyes and ghosts flying over stormy cities.<br /><br /> The music tends to be of two types. On one hand, we have Mangum's laid-back folky ballads; they are sometimes laced with other instruments, but the core is his acoustic guitar and his off-kilter voice. And then there are the swirling panoramas of brass-band, fuzz guitar, accordians, white noise, organ and musical saw, among others. These bizarre melodies are entrancing, almost hypnotic, and the catchier ones sound like the soundtrack of a carnival.<br /><br /> Mangum's voice is a weird one. It isn't very good, and he can't hold the notes (his wail of \\"I loooove you Jeeesusss Chrrriiiisst\\" is outrageously funny). But it meshes into the music as if his vocals were tailor-made for it. And the lyrics are full of weird things that somehow strike a chord in the listener, as if Mangum has tapped into your strangest dreams, ranging from the childlike wonder of \\"King of Carrot Flowers Parts 2 & 3\\" to the wistful: \\"Now she's a little boy in Spain/Playing pianos filled with flames/On empty rings around the sun/All sing to say my dream has come...\\"<br /><br /> Full of psychedelic brass bands and folky songs about children with wings, Neutral Milk Hotel's second album is a rare, magnificent album without a single unworthy song.

B00028HBKM|1.0|A waste of money as they is nothing other then violence and misinformation.
0780624890|4.0|Blade, the action-adventure flick featuring Wesley Snipes as the lead role is a cool movie. The blood/dance scene in the beginning is classic. I loved the sword fighting and gun shootouts. BLADE'S GUN IS SUH WHEAT!!!! However, because the amount of money spent on this movie wasnt anything close to the amount of money put into The Matrix or Underworld, some of the sword fighting is dumb-looking. At times, if you go super-slow on your DVD player, you can actually see that the sword doesn't come anywhere close to hitting the baddies. This makes your BLADE expirience feel more like a backyard homemade movie with your dad's old Hi-8 Panasonic and cardboard swords then a big blockbuster film with real special effects. There are moments that shine however. For example, the scene where it seems like Blade is captured for good and his partner comes and kicks the crap out of the vampires is one very cool section. But for virtually every good scene there is a letdown scene. When one vampire walks in on the other guy listening to music and downloading the code and the one guy slaps the other guy, you can plainly see that his hand doesn't come ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THE OTHER GUY'S FACE. It made me and my friends laugh forever at a scene which is supposed to be serious. It is these moments which prevent Blade from becoming a 5 star movie. Watch for the gun fights and cool scenes and ignore the crappy ones and you will enjoy yourself 100%. Later Y'ALL! PZ OUT!

All Christians can rejoice now that the drunk, hypocritical and self centered Scott Stapp has gone out on his own AND found god again (As read in Christian Music Today). All the  die hard rock and roll fans can rejoice now that Mark Tremonti and company have found a singer and a sound that is REAL and isn't driven by a phony head case. This album rocks from A to Z.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I just wanted to start out by saying this.  For all the reviewers who gave this one star for distorting the facts...can you please be more specific....Well - if you have noticed most, if not all, give no reasons for hating the movie except a vague visceral \\"Its propaganda\\" etc.  Obviously hard core Republican Bots who don't want to engage in critical thinking.   <br />Personally I used to be a republican....Not any more.  I am a retired veteran and seeing this movie made my blood boil. Thinking I was falling into the same emotional trap I wrote of above, I checked Michael Moores facts out independently.  Well -at least as many as I could find.  The Pet Goat episode - true.  The episode of the greiving Mother  - true. The Haliburton shenanigans by Cheney - true. The almost heretical episode of getting the Bin Laden family out of America after 9-11 - -Etc Etc Etc. <br />I was genuinely moved by this movie... No amount of propaganda by the Bill Oreiley's or the Rush Limbaugh's can change that. I guess what moved me the most was the realization that many of our basic freedoms are being challenged - yes by terrorists - but also by the Bush administration. We are starting to reach a world of double think with Big Brother watching our liberties and  anyone who criticizes our government is unpatriotic...How untrue and How sad and How saddened our founding fathers would be to see the state we have come to...and yet one of the upifting messages was the fact that there are still genuine working class stiffs like Michael Moore (ok he's a little richer than he used to be), who have the big brass ones to show the facts as they really are.  Even if he does have an axe to grind with the Bush Administration - so what ????? If you really are an independent thinker who knows the facts in the movie are correct ?? I say again - so what ??  With the kind of incompetence Bush has shown I say - keep grinding away.  <br />Iv'e loved MM since he showed the hypocracy of the Auto Indutry and General Motors in \\"Roger and Me\\" way back in 1989.  Hes hit the jackpot again.... Go see it...and if you post a message on this board with one star give a specific reason for crying out loud. <br />P.S.  As of this writing there are over 1000 men and women in uniform who have died for Bush's war...So far they have found no WMD's and no links to Al Quada....As of this writing the real perpetrator of 9-11, (Osama Bin Laden) has not been found. <br /> <br />JW <br />
B00003BDXG|5.0|No other film in recent history has been as controversial as \\"Natural Born Killers,\\" Oliver Stone's 1994 treatise on violence in America. Perhaps Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" stirred up a few tempers, but the response to that film pales in comparison to the massive outpourings of indignation over this motion picture. Newspaper articles appeared daily documenting how audience members got up and left the theater in disgust due to the movie's excessive carnage. My favorite response came from then Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, who referred to Stone's picture as a \\"nightmare of depravity.\\" The media, apparently unaware that they were the director's primary target (or they knew it and just didn't care), went off on one of their periodic self-examinations before once again engaging in the same activities so viciously parodied in the movie. Such hysterics! Such a bunch of hypocrites! The same people assailing the film's subject matter apparently never made the connection, never realized that they were the ones sitting at home eagerly watching the latest courtroom soap opera, the latest episode of \\"Cops,\\" or the most recent movie of the week based on a murder case. In one respect, I sympathize with people disturbed by the movie: Hollywood preaching to us about violence is like having an unrepentant alcoholic forcing you to go to AA meetings.<br /><br />\\"Natural Born Killers\\" is the story of Mickey and Mallory Knox (Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis respectively), two down on their luck losers that go on a multi-state killing spree. In the course of their numerous grisly crimes, the pair becomes the latest media darlings. Pictures of Mickey and Mallory soon adorn magazine covers, newspapers, and T-shirts. They also capture the attention of muckraker extraordinaire Wayne Gale (Robert Downey, Jr.), a Geraldo Rivera/Hard Copy type sleaze ball who cannot wait to capitalize upon their story. The reporter gets his chance after hardboiled detective Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore) finally brings the criminals down. Gale plans on hosting a special interview with Mickey Knox inside prison, a show he hopes will draw enough ratings to outdo anything seen on television before. Pulling off such an incendiary interview behind the walls of a maximum-security prison is no easy feat, as Warden Dwight McCluskey (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to inform Gale. Undeterred, the \\"journalist\\" goes ahead with his interview. Predictably, chaos breaks out as Mickey guns down a bunch of guards and liberates his beloved Mallory (held in the same prison, surprisingly). Can you believe it? The film actually ends on a happy note--sort of.<br /><br />Of course, that's not the whole movie. Stone tries to show us how Mickey and Mallory are products of our desensitized, media saturated environment. He tells us the story of how the two met at Mallory's home in sitcom form, complete with laugh track and credits, although its one of the most violent sitcoms you'll likely see as Mallory's father (played by Rodney Dangerfield) verbally and physically abuses his family. By the time Mickey escapes from prison and runs off with Mallory, the two are in a state of love that apparently transcends time and space. It also transcends morality, at least the type of morality commonly accepted by most people. No one is safe from the ravages of Mickey and Mallory Knox; they murder anyone who strikes their fancy, be it police officers, women, men, young, old, etc. Meanwhile, Gale is turning these two into a national pastime with reports and specials loaded with frenzied sensationalism concerning their latest exploits. Even celebrity homicide cop Jack Scagnetti plays the game, secretly acting on a sort of wannabe sadism so he can appeal to Mallory. Yep, \\"Natural Born Killers\\" is quite a viewing experience, a film that one must see for themselves in order to understand the weirdness of the whole thing.<br /><br />If you've seen a few Oliver Stone films, you might guess what this movie looks like. The non-traditional camera angles and quick cuts seen in \\"Nixon\\" and \\"JFK\\" jockey for position with hallucinatory imagery, animated sequences, a haunting soundtrack, copious use of overt and covert symbolism, and a host of other bizarre cinematic techniques. It soon becomes quite a chore to follow \\"Natural Born Killers\\" in any logical way as the movie skips about like a broken record. A single viewing of the film will only allow you to marvel at the flash; it takes subsequent attempts to appreciate the message and the performances. The cast does an incredible job with difficult material, with Robert Downey Jr. definitely stealing every scene he's in as the horrific Wayne Gale. His character, I think, is really the centerpiece of the movie. He stands as the archetype of the American media, the sociopathic, insensate bottom feeder interested in human misery as a means to higher ratings and higher profits. In the end, though, Stone indicts all of us for watching this stuff, for feeding the very violence we proclaim to despise.<br /><br />I'm happy with the Director's Cut DVD version. You get a ton of extras here: a commentary track with Oliver Stone, trailers, extra footage, a \\"making of\\" documentary, and interviews. Of special note are the deleted/extended scenes included as a bonus. We finally get to see the Ashley Judd courtroom appearance, which is a lot of fun considering what Mickey Knox does with a pencil. I've noticed a few other DVD versions floating around out there with even more extras, so picking out a specific edition might be difficult. I guess I can't really agree with Bob Dole's take on this film. Yes, much of what we see is depraved, but the message of the film is spot on and has continuing relevancy ten years after the film emerged. Definitely give this one a go.ooks like.

0060977493|4.0|I am going to weigh in very briefly on this book. It has a great story, but it is marred by Arundhati Roy's too frequent displays of mannerism. Many of the characters are very original and the story is full of credible twists and turns, but every thirty pages or so, Ms. Roy lapses into several pages of writing in  apretentious stream-of-conscience/surreal style that soon had me skimming toward the next section of narrative substance. Ms. Roy must have felt that she needed to show off how well she could write, but she ended up underscoring the fact that this was her first novel.

B000002MUN|5.0|Even though Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have made all kinds of great albums togetehr, it seems as though Petty's best work has come form his solo albums. First, it was Full Moon Fever, which contained the monster hit \\"Free Fallin'\\", and popular singles like \\"I Won't Back Down\\", and Runnin' Down A Dream. Then, after releasing the solid album \\"Into The Great Wide Open\\" with the Heartbreakers in 1991, he created the adventourous Wildflowers, a departure from his normal work, and it worked very well. The album still contains some of the rock 'n roll that petty had success with in the past, but overall it's a more mellow album that usual, and it suits him well. Here's an overview of the songs on the album: <br /> <br />Wildflowers: A solid 3 minute tune with some great lyrics, and an excellent melody. 8/10 <br /> <br />You Don't Know How It Feels: One of the albums best tracks, the lyrics and melody are both beautiful. In fact it was this song that got me into Tom Petty when he id it on SNL. 10/10 <br /> <br />Time To Move On: A great song, mainly because of how well the the pacing fits the theme and lyrics. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />You Wreck me: The album's first rock song, a reminder of the rock on damn the Torpedoes and You're gonnas Get It. 9/10 <br /> <br />It's Good To Be King: One of the slower songs here, very strong lyrically, and Petty's vocals are top-notch. 9/10 <br /> <br />Only A Broken Heart:  Probably my least favorite song here, but still good overall, some solid lyrics. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Honey Bee: The most rockin' song on the album. A fun tune with some great blues guitar. 9/10 <br /> <br />Don't Fade On Me; A slow-paced song with very engaging vocals. 8/10 <br /> <br />Hard On Me: A slow song, a little bit like It's Good To Be King. Great melody here. 8/10 <br /> <br />Cabin Down Below: A quick fun song, possibly the most underrated song on the entire album. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />To Find A Friend: An awesome song, with great lyrics, and drumming from Ringo starr. 10/10 <br /> <br />A Higher Place: Another top-notch track with great lyrics, and an incredible vocal performance. 10/10 <br /> <br />House In The Woods: Quite possibly my favorite Petty song of all-time, everything works here. 15/10 <br /> <br />Crawling Back To You. Yet another epic track, with no flaws in sight 10/10 <br /> <br />Wake Up Time: A wonderful way to end the album, a sad but optimistic song that is incredibly well-written. 10/10 <br /> <br />So yeah, I pretty much like every song here. There's no real weakness here, and tons of strong points.

So all and all a good movie with good acting but the excitment of it was very dull.

0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki says you should start a business so you can deduct some of your personal expenses. He claims rich people buy things and then pay taxes while the poor and middle class pay taxes and then buy things. This strategy is downright illegal. You cannot deduct personal expenses under the disguise of running a business. In fact there is no tax advantages on the personal level to running a business when the tax law is properly followed.  <br /> <br />Like most financial book authors Kiyosaki probably is making more money writing and selling books than applying his own principles. Think about it. If his money making strategies were as profitable and easy as he claims he'd have no time to write books.  <br /> <br />Basically Kiyosaki only offers one simple advice in his books. Buy real estate at low prices and sell it even higher. He's incredible biased against any other investment but real estate. He doesn't seem to understand that not everyone enjoys real estate investing and running ones own business.  <br />
B00008LDPU|4.0|As someone who's not into the Matrix movies (I only saw the first) and hasn't seen much Japanese anime I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality animation in this disk.  All nine short animated films can be appreciated by someone, like me, who's unfamiliar with the Matrix mythos.  The live action documentary on the history of anime was fascinating, as well.<br /><br /> One warning.  Each animated sequence last between 16 and 22 minutes, but they all have incredibly long (7 plus minutes) of credits at the end.  I was running the time counter on the first sequence and couldn't believe they were running credits half way through.
B00005JNEI|3.0|What a shame. <br /> <br />3 Stars for pure entertainment value. I laughed for a while, until I was thoroughly insulted by the overall presentation... <br /> <br />Michael Moore had an amazing and potentially convincing set of facts that he could have used as the basis for a genuinely moving condemnation of the current (and former Bush) administration(s). Instead, in the name of \\"entertainment,\\" he resorted to a presentation of material that is, at best, misleading, and at worst, outright deceptive. Not because of a lack of factual content-that was present. What wasn't present was a respectful presentation of information that even a moderately educated and open-minded person would hope for. The film resorts to overly emotional and exploitative presentation of facts that end up overshadowing the content that really could have had impact. <br /> <br />I went into the film with high expectations. I wanted to see a balanced presentation of information that subtly and impressively drew conclusions regarding the lack of honesty and integrity of the current administration. Instead, I saw a poorly conceived attempt to make the President look like an idiot-and despite the fact that I personally have HUGE problems with the present administration, I left more angry with the insulting and emotional presentation of the facts Moore sited than with the actions of the Administration he was trying to condemn.  <br /> <br />Sure, if you have leftward leanings, you might leave the theater shouting \\"YEAH!!...See??? I told you Bush was a dishonest moron.\\" But then again, it's easy to pander to an audience that's already convinced of your main premise. It's preaching to the choir.  <br /> <br />On the other side of the aisle, viewers coming from the right hand perspective probably perceived the overly emotional and biased manner in which the information was presented, and left feeling nothing but insulted. Moore missed an opportunity to present facts in a credible manner that actually might have swayed people on that side of the aisle in the direction he hoped.  <br /> <br />Speaking of swaying opinion, can anyone who saw this film actually believe that it could alter the opinion of anyone? It's a scary thought to me that people could be swayed by scenes like Moore's insulting presentation of the President in the classroom when he was informed of the first plane hitting the tower on 9/11. The dramatic music. The focus on the President's face that-if you watch-simply took a snapshot of time when his facial expression could have been interpreted as confused. And you know what, he might have been confused for a moment at that time. What was the plane? A commuter jet? A prop job? What should he have done? Jumped up in the middle of a room full of children and shouted \\"Holy SH*&^, kids. We're under attack!! Get under your desks!!!\\" Gimme a break. Could he have gotten up, and gracefully and quickly exited at that point? Sure. He stayed with the children in that classroom for 7 minutes. Maybe that's 6 minutes too long. I don't know. Moore offered no real alternatives to what should have been or could have been accomplished at that point in time.  <br /> <br />I consider myself to be a centrist. I no longer identify with either Party-partially because of the partisan crap that is personified by this movie, as well as it's poorly thought out literary response by the right, \\"Unfit for Command\\" (yeah, sure, it was initiated by Swift boat personnel, right...). It's films like this and books like that that make me want to avoid the entire political process-because everything get presented on such a slant that I just tend to fall right off.  <br /> <br />It seems to me that we'll only make real progress toward bipartisanism when somebody actually steps up to the plate and says \\"I will not engage in the political rhetoric that is intended to impugn the integrity of people on the other side of the issue.\\" Some people say that you have to fight fire with fire. No you don't. You fight fire by taking a different road that leads to real integrity. You don't engage in the childish argument that says \\"Well, they shot first, so we had to respond.\\" <br /> <br />This film does nothing more than continue to drive a wedge between people, pander to its already zealous audience, and insult the integrity of its viewers.  <br /> <br />And it's a damn shame, becaue Michael Moore had the facts that people need to be exposed to.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a difficult film to rate because of the controversy it engendered and the phenomenon it became.  Generally, with films like this I prefer to wait a while before evaluating them but I will make an exception here.  First off, one has to admire the risk that Mel Gibson took in even making this film.  He could have contented himself making \\"Lethal Weapon\\" sequels and \\"What Women Want\\", films that are high concept and high box-office but have no emotional resonance.  To make this film as brutally realistic and in Latin and Aramaic took a lot of courage.  As for the film itself I found it so powerfully compelling that I saw it three times when it was in the theatres.  The depiction of the crucifixion is brutal for a reason; Gibson wants to show us in no uncertain terms that Jesus suffered for our sins because he loves us and the will of the Father was to save humanity.  There is no blame allotted here; we are all guilty for the sins of humanity.  This film had such resonance for me that sermons that I may have heard in church thousands of times took on extra meaning that was not apparent to me before.  As for the acting, Jim Caviezel is more than adequate in portraying the humanity of Jesus.  He does not so much capture Christ's divinity but that may be more the choice of Gibson's than the actor's.  Overlooked in many reviews is the performance of Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother.  Though given little dialogue, her facial expressions say millions of words particualarly in the scenes where she witnesses the suffering of her son.  Another standout performance here is by Hristo Shopov as the indecisive Pilate.  I would also recommend this film to mature young teenagers despite the graphic nature of the violence here.  There is a difference between violence that is instructive and that which is exploitative.  On a final note, I wish they had included more extras on the DVD release, at least a commentary by Gibson.  Gibson included a commentary on the \\"Braveheart\\" DVD, which I found to be one of the best of it's kind.  My guess is that they will eventually put the extras on a future deluxe edition of this film, which is a shame, because I do not think Gibson entered into this enterprise as a cynical attempt to make money.

The first cd is just full of classic hits, end of story. The second cd is Michael's most confessional work, expressing his feelings towards, racism, politics, state of the world, and the media. He also expresses the longings of his childhood in \\"Childhood,\\" and how he must return to the roots of his past. A cover of \\"Smile\\" is not the best, but doesn't hurt and the ballad of Little Susie is heartaching and very creative.<BR>A must have, BUY NOW
0393035158|5.0|As is my habit when browsing in my local bookstore, I pick up a book that I might be interested in and read the first few pages.  The End Of Faith by Sam Harris is a keeper.  Although, as a person of faith, I can't agree with everything that Mr. Harris posits, I find myself not only intellectually challenged by his work but, more profoundly, realizing how rarely I question the consequences of belief itself.  We live in an ever more complicated world and as Mr. Harris points out, we must seek reasonable solutions to our most basic problems.  The End of Faith is both a good read and a disturbing challenge to the status quo.
1400049628|4.0|When my boyfriend first offered me this book to read, I was reluctant to open it up, since I'm not a big fan of zombies.  However, once I got into it, I couldn't stop reading.  Max Brooks does an excellent job planning out attack strategies and survival tips, and some of the incidents that he described as possibly happening were humorous.  I recommend this book as something to read on a stormy night if you fear the dead's arrival.
B000089CJI|5.0|The Postal Service's debut album give-up is nothing but a master peice. The musical genius of Ben Gibbard from Death Cab for Cutie, along with DNTEL's Jimmy Tamborello colaberate to create a unique indie sound unlike anyone else, and don't think it stops there. The CD's just as unique as the band, find out how the postal service and give up came to be, aswell as where the intrigueing name came from! It'll keep you wrapped up for hours!
0441172717|5.0|Amidst the politics, the social playoffs, and the romance, Dune is certainly one of the best novels that I have ever read.  Frank Herbert creates an amazing world where spice is sacred and water is treasure, and a struggle between the Atreides, the Harkonnens, and CHOAM reveal a new leader and a saint.  Each chapter left me curious for more, and I eventually even moved onto reading the rest of the saga. <br /> <br />Although some of the politics get drawn out sometimes, the novel itself is amazing and keeps you interested.  It's a must read!
B00028HBKM|4.0|Lets face it the film is a gore fest, but i have seen worse and the only true gruesome scenes is when Jesus was whipped. he faced so much and agony by Romans and civilians in those days. Even if they say the Jews killed Jesus, it should refer to the Jews two thousand years ago, not the Jews living now. The film dipicts the Devil the best i have ever seen. The evil the devil presents show why he is the true enemy in this picture. Jesus may have suffered but he wins and in a way defeats Satan. Even if your not catholic you can still watch this film, the gore is the only aspect that makes it rated R. Yet i was dissapointed with the ending becuase it was too quick with the resurrection.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|This cd is by far one of the best rap albums I have heard in a long long time and I don't even like rap that much. I can't stand eminem either but this cd is most excellent.  There are songs Like \\"Bitch\\" \\"40 oz\\" and \\"American Psycho\\" that will fire you up and get you ready to party.  There is also songs with great meanings behind them like \\"Good Die Young\\" and \\"How Come.\\"  This cd is a most have!!
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|In New York City our movie theatres cost $10.50 not $7.50. The free movie ticket isn't entirely free. Great film and great deluxe edition. Can't wait for the sequel.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion of The Christ is still just as powerful viewing it on DVD as it was in the movies.  You (vicariously) feel those lashes that Jesus endured; you feel sorry for the anguish his mother had to go through - knowing that her son HAD to do this. <br />You will want to watch the DVD over and over especially after reading the scriptures to see how the movie correlates with it.
B00000DS4L|5.0|This album is the greatest album of that world. Randy Rhoads his juste a GOD!! He do a very very great solo in suicide solution.<BR>I realy love that album.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|This album is what truely brings me home when it comes to fresh new music.  I love many classic acoustic songs, and Josh Rouse manages to have a superb acoustic sound with a very stong and hip rock sound as well.  He focusses on the lyrics and melody, not the typical \\"drowning out\\" I hear in many rock songs of today.  Josh Rouse, you have made a generally electronic music fan a happy listener!
B00000DSEK|4.0|Cet album est bon mais il est unpeu trop anne 80 meme si il a t fait 1991. Dans ce CD il y a beaucoup de chanson asser Heavy avec le gros rif killer mais il y a aussi des chanson comme ''time after time'' et ''a road to nowhere'' qui son eu peu trop slow.
B00018D3JQ|5.0|This is a great record.  Period.  Of course, you have to dig the lounge vibe, but if you do you'll absolutely love it.  RIchard Cheese is great, too, but he is sarcastic whereas this is straight ahead, bossa nova style groove.  One reviewer hated it because the songs are covers from classic old punk.new wave bands, but so what?  It isn't as if you can't get those records anymore, or that those have been replaced with this--it is an homage, really.  One of the best purchases I have made in a long time.
B00005JMEW|5.0|One of the best movies ive seen this year.  <br /> <br />Be warned however, this is one of those movies where you either love it, or you hate it.  I have two friends who hated it. But thankfully most of use loved it. <br /> <br /> <br />mailer@istop.ws
B00000AFGM|5.0|I am a recently recruited Marilyn Manson fan. This is the first and only album of theirs that I own so far. When I first played it, I played the big hits like The Dope Show, I Don't Like the Drugs, and Coma White. After a while I began listening to the songs before and after the hits, and before you know it I was listening to the entire album.  <br /> <br />Like I said before, I don't know the feel and mood of any other Manson albums but this had a kind of 70s and 80s feel to it. I thoroughly enjoyed this because it reminds me of the 70s and 80s hard rock bands that I listen to. It also had some new wave sounding sounds which were very fun.  <br /> <br />Just like in the song Mechanical Animals, Manson \\"will never be good to you and  never be bad to you\\" but he will satisfy your every need from slow songs like Fundamentally Loathsome to funky 80s new wave like New Model to a major hit like The Dope Show. This album proves that rock is not deader than dead!!!
B0002NRQTS|5.0|I own the original PRESTO CD and I just have to ask...why has this CD been remastered?  The CD is DDD...it says right on the compact disc...the CD sounds truly awesome!  Same with the CD for ROLL THE BONES - DDD...that has been remastered too...just get better headphones, jeez! <br /> <br />The CD that REALLY needs remastering is VAPOR TRAILS--the whole thing sounds so muddled and distorted whenever you turn it up too high...I could care less if it gets remastered or not, VT rocks like crazy no matter what!  GOD I LOVE THIS BAND!!
0060987464|4.0|I recently gave in to my inner Marilyn Manson fascination less than two weeks ago. Before then, I would pick up his CDs and just stare at the covers mesmerized either in fear or curiousity or a mixture of both. When his autobiography came out, I did the same. I would pick it up and read snippets until my parents or sister came by, then I would put it down and runaway from it. Two weeks ago my father and I were at a bookstore and while he was elsewhere in the store, I picked it up and began reading it.  <br /> <br />      The next week I had him take me back to the bookstore and I bought it- at that point I didn't care who saw me! I am usually a slow reader but I finished this book in two days. I couldn't put it down! Manson's chapter about the teen dabbler was funny and relatable. Even though I am a girl, I was able to identify with what he thought, felt, and experienced at that time in his life. Marilyn Manson portrays himself as the loser that he was- and that is something that makes him so popular among teenagers. They are able to relate to him. He's a real person with many flaws, especially in his teenage years. <br /> <br />     The only thing I didn't like is that sometimes he wasn't clear at what point in his life a certain event was occuring. That's the only reason why I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars!! I recommend this book to everyone!! It gives an insight into the wonderful, wacky world of Marilyn Manson and in a way our own worlds. This is a fun, easy, and entertaining read. If I were you I would stop reading this review get it immediately!!!!!!!!
B00028HBKC|5.0|I wanted to watch in the privacy of my own home instead of a theater with others.  This is a private thing and an individual faith issue.  I was very curious and wanted to be impartial. I heard about the graphic's and a lot of reviews against MG and wanted to see for myself first. TOTALLY AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! I talked to a fellow congragation member just tonight because of all of the questions going thru my head & heart.  Then I found & printed the Catholic mystic from another viewer & I TY very much.  I'm gonna look that up!  I was under the impression it was all from the 4 Gospels & now I know better. Now I'm waiting for the collectors edition whenever it is released!!
B0001FR3IG|5.0|Very good movie and it has a realy good story, If you want to sit alone in the dark and watch a horror movie, This one recommnded for you.
B000002OX7|5.0|Pete Townshend took over 30 years to put \\"Lifehouse\\" together, a concept which confused a lot of people at the time, something that was science fiction and spiritual, trying to get an \\"interactive experience\\" out of it. When he finally put \\"Lifehouse\\", it seemed more to bury an old ghost.  <br /> <br />But what could have been a confusing disaster at the time (which could have spelt the end of the band) was \\"salvaged\\" by the release of \\"Who's Next\\". From beginning to end, the band entered the 70s kicking and screaming, leaving their peers in the dust and ably competing with \\"new kids\\" Led Zeppelin, Queen and Black Sabbath. The music became radio staples: \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" (aka Teenage Wasteland), \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" (a song Townshend refused to license to Michael Moore for \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\"), \\"My Wife\\", \\"Going Mobile\\", \\"Bargain\\", and so on.  <br /> <br />The extra tracks are far from filler. \\"Naked Eye\\" for one is familiar to people who have seen them live. For those who love classic rock, musicianship and well-crafted songs, this is an essential addition to your collection for years to come.  <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|In short this is a great film. Most people do not like it because it is very graphic. But it is well worth owning. As for an earlier review that stated that we have separation of Church vs. State, that is very true. We do have separation of Church AND State. NOT separation of Church FROM State.
B00005QK3B|5.0|This album is an absolute masterpiece which has unfortunately been overlooked and so is not as well known as other prog rock masterpieces.  This is a shame because it deserves to be up there. <br /> <br />Even though the songs are primarily about Fish's experiences they open up and allow anybody to enter who has a touch of melancholy about there childhood experiences.   <br /> <br />The album starts off with the protagonist experiencing a 'morning mare' which is the spirit of his misplaced childhood.  The vision then takes us on a journey, the first part being the remembrance of lost love 'Kayleigh' with it's beautiful melody.  This breaks way into another love related song 'Lavender' where children singing remind the protagonist of the lost love song that he always wanted to write.   <br /> <br />Things turn a little darker then when we are taken on the memories of the protagonist visiting a prostitute in Lyon to try and erase the pain of a broken relationship.  Instead the protagonist ends up 'falling' for the prostitute as a substitute for his lost love.  But he is stood up by the prostitute and has a 'misplaced rendevous' with the parallel of his lost love, who never boards the plane. <br /> <br />So the protagonist goes back home and tries to drown his sorrows in shows of bravado and drinking \\"Heart of Lothian\\" but this doesn't really help the protagonist and he is left facing himself with sad eyes in the mirror.  Thus endeth side one. <br /> <br />Side two then takes us on an even darker journey as the protagonist starts to fall apart and finds the world a very dark place to live in indeed.  But from this breakdown come the seeds of hope (in an almost alchemical type process) and the protagonist realises that he hasn't misplaced a childhood at all, but has misplaced direction, and now that he has found direction there is no childhood's end.  And so ends the second half on a positive note. <br /> <br />So the album takes us through the whole process of relationship breakdown to falling apart to finding hope through it all. <br /> <br />Ans that's just the story.. The music behind it all is nothing short of magical. <br /> <br />One hell of a listening experience that everyone should go on at least once. <br /> <br />
B000255LIY|2.0|There are a few things in life that are perfect.  The 1968 original of 'Lion in Winter' is one such rare thing.  Why remake it at all?  There was only one way such a project could compare to the original: badly.  The brilliant flamoyance and radiant light that burst from O'Toole and Hepburn are missing here.    Instead we have a Patrick Stewart who fails as Henry II for the very reasons he succeeded as Aelius Sejanus in 1977's 'I, Claudius' and Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on the Star Trek: Next Generation.  He simply is not the right man for part of this type.  Especially after the genius of O'Toole's 1968 performance.         This remake is a perfect illustration of what separates the good (even the very good) from the great.  The icy precision that made Glenn Close such a delicious Marquise de Mertuil in Steven Frear's 1987 'Dangerous Liasions.\\"  But Eleanor of Acquitance was no cold, scheming machine.  She was a woman of strong passion and appetite, every inch the equal of Henry and the superior of all other men around her.  In the chaotic mess of the 12th century she shines out as a shining beacon that West was reawakening.    Close's emotional scenes seem more histrionic than accomplished.  The dignity and gravitas that made you ready \\"suspend disblief\\" for the original, simply isn't here in this version.  I'm not saying Close is hamming it or overacting.  She's trying to imitate things Hepburn had and she doesnt.  It doesn't work. Katherine Hepburn, as Close did with the Marquise, has forever cemented that role as hers.  No other actress could or has done it justice.  Even more so Eleanor of Acquitaine.  It's not a fault, it's a question of charisma.  Close is now, arguably, our greatest living actress.  But this part is not hers.      Further she and Stewart lack the chemistry that O'Toole and Hepburn created so magnetically.  In the original, it seems like a window in time; suspension of disbelief was easy with Hervey's gritty, low budget direction then.      Thereal failure is the supporting cast.  They get an F.  Minus.  No, I won't be that harsh, but they are simply less than B actors.  Even the 'Bend like Bechkam\\" star who plays French King Phillip Augustus comes off as doing a bad Joaquin Phoenix impersonation a la 'Gladiator.'  They simply aren't up to snuff.  Julia Vsotsky (Alais) seems to struggle with Goldman's still noble lines.  She lacks the heart-rending beauty of the original Alais and the acting skills.  The rest seem to struggle with delivering lines period.      In all, as it had to be, a disappointment.  Calling it \\"solid\\" is generous in the extreme.  The movies rises close to the origianl only in a few scenes in the second half; I leave to judge which ones.  Only in these does the suspension of disbelief take hold; only these few scenes do we forget we're seeing acting and become immersed in the story.    As I said, this movie illustrates the good from the great.  Patrick Stewart is a good actor.  He's competent and thorough; can anyone else imagine another as Capt. Picard?  But he doesn't have the charisma or elan of O'Toole.      Close, a truly great actress, is simply miscast.  Some challenges shouldn't be met.  The performance is a misfire and, in this film at least, she captures none of the scene-stealing glory of 'Dangerou Liasions\\" or the unforgettable collapse at the end of that same movie.  Here, her skills simply don't work.    Stick with the original.  It's still one of the greatest films of all time.  This remake, however, is not.  And, it simply wasn't necessary.  The first was a complete vision, nothing was missing, no improvement could be made.  And, it it isn't.      I also note that this was Executive Produced by Stewart and his estragned or divorced wife, Wendy Neuss (a STNG producer).  One wonders if this disaster lead to another.    Avoid.

B00004XONN|5.0|i only have two radiohead albums (though i know alot of their catalog), the two i have are pablo honey, and kid a. ive heard alot of bulls*** artsy/pretentious noise rock bands who do all in their power to sound as un-accessable as possible, at first you might think its like this, i did too. but this music doesnt ditch melody as completely as you might think it does, the songs are actually very catchy, thom york (if thats his name) is an AMAZING singer, possibly one of my favorites. sure, for the vast majority of the album i wondered is he even saying words (he is), but even with the lack of clarity, the vocals are probably what stands out the most. take ideoteque, which start with a pounding over-emphasized (almost) techno drums, comes in with a very nice keyboard part, and possibly the catchiest vocals ever (women and children first {if thats the actual lyrics}). yea i cant give proof to why this is a great album as with anything based on opinion, but just take my word for it, i love this album.
B0000C7PRY|2.0|I love Spock's Beard (before Neal left) and I love Neal Morse's first two solo albums. I love TransAtlantic.  All brilliant stuff.  Now comes Neal Morse's \\"testament\\" to his religious conversion. The music is just as good as any Spock's Beard, Neal Morse, or TransAtlantic album.  Great prog stuff and great musicianship.  But the lyrics... Okay, I don't hold it against Neal that he's religious or that he's a Christian. But I think he could have tempered the \\"message\\" of this album to appeal to practitioners of ALL faiths.  Hey Neal, what about your fans who are Jewish? What about your fans that are Muslim?  What about your fans that are Hindu or Buddhist?  You have alienated them with this album.  Not everyone is a Christian and readily embraces music about \\"finding Jesus.\\"  Neal Morse is sickeningly talented and can write great music. But gee, isn't it possible to be religious and STILL continue to do the kind of music you built your reputation upon?  Leaving Spock's Beard to follow this line of music doesn't make sense.  Why does one kind of music preclude the other?<br /><br />At any rate, I find \\"Testimony\\" a good listen if I block out the lyrics--which is difficult to do.
0553583182|5.0|I had the good fortune to discover this book in a Barnes and Noble at probably the lowest point in my life. After reading it and applying the principles, things improved immeasurably. I became happier and more successful. I had been hanging around with a \\"bad crowd\\" and made new emotionally healthier, more fun friends. I had always struggled in school, but my grades improved, as well. I graduated from college, moved out of my parents' house, found an apartment and was able to go to Europe once a year! In short, thanks to this book, I was doing things that I wouldn't have even dreamed before.<br /><br />I also recommend Claude Bristol's \\"The Magic of Believing,\\" Norman Vincent Peale's \\"The Power of Positive Thinking,\\" and Shakti Gawain's \\"Creative Visualization.\\" If you want to improve your life and don't know where to start, order one of these books.

B0000931QR|5.0|This CD is absolutely awesome!  I love this group.  The first time I heard them I was studying abroad in Spain, and last summer I bought this CD while doing an internship there.  I also heard them live last summer and they rock.  All of their songs have an awesome beat, and you can listen to the whole CD and not want to skip over anything it is so good.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes Spanish pop.
B0000524CY|2.0|I bought this \\"classic\\" expecting to be at least mildly frightened.What a let down, it was REALLY boring and the \\"scary\\" parts were anything but.
0060278250|5.0|This storyline is very engrossing and the ending of the Abhorsen Trilogy is very moving. Nix has created an outstanding new world of possibilities and this series should attrack any fan of the fantasy genre. Highly recommended.
B00023BLXK|5.0|I orginally watched this because I had grown up with \\"Baby\\" and the orginal Dirty Dancing.  Despite the modern sound of the music the story was amazing.  I easily fell in love with the new characters as I had with the original.  I usually watch dance movies simply because I love dancing.  Havana Nights captures the fact you dance what you feel, more than the orginal, it adds the spicy touch of the sexy salsa, to the strict form of ballroom dancing. <br /> <br />Its got many of the same idea's of the Orginal, such as romance, the falling in love with the boy who works for the resort, Patrick Swayze is in the movie as well as a dance instructor; and in the dance scequence you can see so many of the moves found in the orginal done by Baby and Johnny, except with the spicy latin twist added to it. <br /> <br />This is a movie worthy of being added to the collection, despite my orginal thoughts of a \\"Dirty Dancing 2\\" which I orginally rolled my eyes at.  I am truely glad I gave it a chance and picked this movie up.
B000002U82|3.0|I have to give it to Floyd, the band carved out it's own niche and did it well. The whooshing noises, spacey feel, and dubbed over voices/sound effects is their schtick - Not to mention incredible song writing. There's even really futuristic synth sounds which still hold up to this day. I have several knocks on this album though. First, I don't think it's their best album by any means. I think Piper At The Gates of Dawn along with their early singles amounts to the best recorded Floyd material this audiophile has ever heard. I even think Umma Gumma is more of a thinking mans album than Darkside. But hey, I come from a garage psyche/punk aesthetic so that stuff is just legendary. Also, in terms of their more thematic later works I prefer Animals to the Darkside. It's a great album for neophites, but once you start penetrating the Floyd ouvre you realize that at some point you'll depart from it and find some other album of theirs to cling on to. I'll also say that albums like this tend to polarize people. If you're blown away by what you hear on the radio, then buy this because you'll like the rest of it guaranteed.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Laser gun guitars, maudlin art-school lyrics, keyboards, glitz, vocals that evoke Morrissey and Morrison, a touch of homoeroticism, a gallon of speed. <br /> <br />Every song is fast and vibrant. This is rock for people who like to dance, but who think Jet sucks. Fabulous debut.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|I have bought her other compilations and greatest hits--but this is the best and most comprehensive!  As a longtime listener of Donna Summer since 1978, she made some unbelievable songs, not just for disco, but for other genres as well.  All the hits, from Last Dance, to my favorite On the Radio, to Dim All The Lights to Bad Girls to Hot Stuff, to Hard For the Money, to This Time I Know It's For Real (yes I followed Donna in '89!) are on here. Donna and Giorgio Moroder were the Lennon/McCartney of the late '70s, an excellent pairing and an endless run of hits! And I love the two new songs she did in 2003. It shows her willingness to move forward as a singer.  I like the new disco-based song that she did.  I like that Donna moved forward when most of the other disco stars faded in the '80s.  Would have liked one song from her '87 album (Dinner With Gershwin) on Geffen, but you can't get everybody.  This is better than Endless Summer from 10 years ago, only more this time! I played this album this summer on the interstate in New Mexico on a road trip! And you need to have this album in your collection!  Excellent dance floor music!!!!!!
B00028HBKC|5.0|As a Catholic boy growing up I always heard about the sacrifice God made for us by sentencing His only Son to death. But it was never something that hit home. I thought, \\"Yeah it's horrible to lose a son. But thousands upon thousands of people lose loved ones every day.\\" Simplistic I know. What with growing up in an age where one's senses become so jaded from an oversaturization of media and from a disheartening desensitization to violence, sex, and profanity, it sadly (but thankfully) took a Hollywood blockbuster movie to help me realise that God was not only losing His only Son, but losing Him in the most painfull way possible. I now understand with all my heart what Christ went through to save us. This was the worst death I've ever seen. And it was done for you and me.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|But, I mean. 2003 has been a horrible year for cinema, you know. I was hoping to watch at least a good movie of 2003, because all my expectations have been blown out. Mystic River is decent. The main actors are really great, the plot is original and very interesting and the end is quite unexpected. <br /> <br />The fact is that the screenplay is not as good as what it should be. Although not having read the book, it is clear that some things could be done. The passage of the film shows two possible ways of solving the crime involved in the film. But you are always with the certainty that none of both is possible. <br /> <br />Besides of the three main characters (Penn, Robbins and Bacon) it seems that Fishburne has almost the same to do as the latter. <br /> <br />Something more to say about Bacon's role. I have not got the real sense of \\"silent phone conversations\\" with his fiance. The fact is that Penn's role is worth a nominee for Oscars, but I think that it's more deserved for a long career than for a master performance in this film. And Robbins' role is quite as interesting as Penn's. <br /> <br />I think Eastwood is the responsible of this movie not being an unforgettable one. He sure did it better in \\"Unforgiven\\". Hire it and you won't regret. But if you want to buy it, you won't be rewatching it at all times.
B00005JMJG|4.0|To quote Alexander Pope (Eloisa to Abelard) \\"How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot. / Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!\\"<br /><br />The title film, taken from this poem, is more about love and relationships, than about anything kooky.<br /><br />But kookiness, in the form of memory-erasure, is the vehicle in which you'll drive during your viewing of the movie.<br /><br />This is definitely one of Jim Carey's better \\"straight-man\\" movies, and I would remcommend it to all.
B00008H2LB|1.0|come on guys. why did you give this album a bad review? lincin park is the shiznig. they're so hardcore and in your face when they scream about how tough their lives are. any one who can't handle the screams and hardcore lyrics are stupid. yo guys, lincin park all the way
B00005JMAH|4.0|Yes, as repeated hundreds of times I'm sure, the movie is not as faithful to the book as it could have been.  Lots of things were left out, which I won't restate yet again.  But really now, how many people have actually commented on the MOVIE? <br /> <br />If you ignore what you have memorized from the book, the movie is outstanding!  People argue that certain things weren't done correctly, like the few instances when Ron makes a reference to Hermione's sudden attendance in certain classes.  People say that there needed to be more references to these important events.  But you have to realize, it's much easier to retain information from a movie than through a book because it does take longer to read a book than it does to watch a movie (most of the time.) So if the director put each of these references into the movie, it would have become clear to those that are new to this installment that something really WAS going on and would have taken away the \\"ohhhhh,\\" when Hermione reveals her Time Stopper necklace thing. <br /> <br />Also, the cinematography...sweet!  The cinematography in this movie was amazing, it truely was!  The camera's kept moving, which added a lot of awe to the movie, like in the scene with the Dementor on the train, or the scene at the lake where the Dementors converge. And even the subtle things, like when Harry fell off his broom at Quidditch and Dumbeldor stands up to save Harry with the wave of his hand...awesome! <br /> <br />And the music!  Spectacular, John Williams!  Perfect theme for the family, although Family Portrait was clearly left out, it was nice to hear an even better theme! <br /> <br />So let's not give bad scores JUST because it was unfaithful to the book, because as a lone movie, I personally think it was magnificant!  A ton of work clearly went into this picture, and I would hate to see it get 500 reviews that said how unfaithful it was to the book compared to the past movies when it obviously had so much more than the past movies had <br />
B00005JMXX|4.0|The movie in and of itself is awsome! I enjoyed 99% of the time it's 25fps were flashed on the big screen, but there were some really really corny parts that you KNOW were inserted either by stupidity or corporate execs who said \\"IT HAS TO BE IN THERE!!\\".<br /><br />Like the wolves. Stupidest thing ever. I hate it because it's only there to fulfill some sort of \\"profile\\" or moviegoer pollsters found after being paid $400,000 to survey 100 people and extrapolate those findings over 300 million Americans. It's just too obvious.<br /><br />And what the heck is the President doing at the White House during a blizzard that people KNOW is going to go bad?<br /><br />The British weather station is also weird. First the head dude says \\"We have enough to go on for years!\\" and then they run out of oil 5 hours later? Right.<br /><br />BUT I loved the special effects, which are really good and almost flawless. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the VP's reactions before and after do mirror our current VP. And the acting is pretty good most of the times.<br /><br />All in all it's a very good movie- watch it before you buy it though!<br /><br />Mahalo, Chris
B000001FY9|5.0|Playing this CD is truly taking a wide glimpse over Bob Marley's musical genius and life filled with great songs love and compassion. The rythmic tunes and soulful lyrics come at you so fast that the words of the song can sometimes loose meaning without noticing their true nature. This priceless album would be embraced and cherished by any person willing to stop and forget every negative Rastafarian stereotype and enjoy them.  You don't have to be educated in the realm of Jamaican history or reggae methods to get the message of the songs. These jamaican beats and rythms are pleasing to me as a white male from the suburbs that didn't know about Bob Marley until his cd was widely recognized. I'm sure that true reggae greats and Jamaican refugees can relate even better to the words of the songs, but even so, I truly can say that no other album creates the same mood as this one. Even after his death, the songs still have lifelong significance as each is entirely original and utterly breathtaking in their own strength and soothing tone, shifting around from wildly popular fierce 'Get up, Stand up', to the softer more musical 'Stir it up'.  These transitions show Bob Marley's entirely unique methods of musical creativity and if you only had one reggae album from the entire world, you should make it this one.
B000003S0R|5.0|Everyone is familiar with Eno's famous production collaborations with Talking Heads, David Bowie and of course, U2, but I think people sometimes forget how good a pop writer Eno can be.  This is Eno at his quirkiest and most catchy.  The record is deep with gems.
B0000524CY|4.0|This film has been around for 30 years. You probably know the storyline, but how does it still be the scariest film in history?    A subliminal message is not intense enough to produce a sensation but has sufficient intensity to influence the behavior and mental processes of one's mind. Exorcist, is the first movie applying such technique to increase the horrific effects, and also it brought the subliminal issues to the attention of the public. A report said a filmgoer fainted and broke his jaw on the seat in front of him while he's seeing the original release movie in 1974. He then sued Warner Brothers for the use of subliminal imagery in the Exorcist film that caused him to pass out, and the case eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Later on, subliminal technique was banned in advertising and movie industries for a while.    Most of the subliminal shots in the film are: the ghastly demonic face, Father Karras's mother, and Pazuzu, which is the demon inside Regan and later inside Father Karras. If you want to examine those shots in details, make sure your dvd remote control have 'stepping' or 'very slow motion' feature. They are happened in a fraction of second. You should be able to find them from the following scenes:  - Father Karras's dream  - Lights flickering in Chris Macneil's kitchen  - Chris Macneil entering her daughter's room  - Father Karras jumping out from Regan's room    There's also a new ending where Father Dyer and Lieutenant Kinderman meet together and chat about movies. Most people think that it's echoing Kinderman's earlier talk with Father Karras; however, it's also seeding the next Exorcist sequel (not in Exorcist 2 but in Exorcist 3 directed by the author himself William Peter Blatty, where Ed Flanders played Father Dyer and George Scott played Lt. Kinderman).    If you want to know what's going on to Regan, check out the Exorcist 2, in which also reveals the truth of how Father Merrin was actually killed in the Exorcist I. If you are interested on Father Dyer and Lt. Kinderman after 25 years, go for Exorcist 3.    *** Otto Yuen's DVD Special Rating for Exorcist I ***  1. Film Rewatchability: HIGH  2. DVD Featurability: WEAK  3. Picture Quality: VERY GOOD  4. Sound Quality: VERY GOOD    (Reviewed by Otto Yuen, 2-Sep-2004)
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Ok, being a pianist my whole life and loving all genres of music literally from classical to the depressing, lets get drunk tunes of country, i have fallen in love with Fiona Apple. Not only as an artist, but as a person who speaks her mind and conveys so many raw emotions through her music. The lyrics she uses aren't something a Britney Spears or someother manufactured musical celebrity could write.. these lyrics are true and str8 from the heart of passion which comes across so powerfully in her voice.. not only does she sing it but she makes you the listener feel what she's feeling with her voice.. and that my friends is the sign of a true accomplishment, one which every performer aims to achieve. \\"When the Pawn\\" is a fabulous album of love, regret, and moving on.. i hope you all enjoy it as much as i have. also.. buy her first album as well \\"Tidal\\"
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I can't describe how great this cd is, so take my word for it and BUY \\"UNDER MY SKIN\\" YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!  If you are a fan then you should definitely add this to your collection!  If not...well, get it anyways!  Compared to Britney Spears and Hilary Duff, Avril WRITES HER OWN SONGS. <br /> <br />OH I'm sorry, Britney DID write \\"Everytime\\", my sincere apologies to her!!!!...but Avril is still #1 the best LOL!
B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie is not based upon the Bible.  It comes from a book written by a looney nun (Anne Catherine Emmerich) published in 1833: \\"The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\\" <br /> <br />Better to spend your money on \\"The Passion of the Jew,\\" a South Park episode which proves that Mel Gibson is crazy.
014028009X|5.0|This book is written in the form as a diary. I think this technique was very effective and amusing. This is a laugh-out loud funny novel! This is a book that woman can read and appreciate whether single, divorced or happily coupled with someone. Everyone will appreciate the ups and downs of Bridget and her friends. It's a very hard book to put down so prepare to be absorbed into the story, to laugh out loud quite a few times and to feel, even in some tiny way, oddly relating to Bridget's everyday tribulations.
B00005JMCN|2.0|I thought this film was cheesy. The storyline was choppy in the beginning-and it was very predictable. I think if you like horses, by all means rent it.  <br />I just could not get into it. It wasn't a bad movie-it just wasn't a film that captivated me.
B0002S94OS|4.0|i dont know, i still think unearth has the award for bes album of 04, but this album is just amazing. i could change my mind, because i havent listend to this enough to fully judge it, but i DO know that this is awsome. the drum production is a huge improvment over the past 2 albums, very good. if u like metal in general, this is a must have. great stuff
0316168815|4.0|I held off on reading this book when it first came out.  Although it got good reviews, I wasn't sure how interesting it would really be.  But I eventually decided to give it try.  Turns out I was wrong about not liking the story. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book so much that I finished in one day.  I was really intrigued by the author's concept of heaven - that it is unique for everyone.  I thought the author did a great job in creating believable characters and storylines. <br /> <br />My only complaint about the book is that it drags a little bit and the Ruth/Susie body switch was a little hokie.  <br /> <br />Although not a light subject matter, this book was a good read and I would recommend it to others.
0393035158|5.0|Finally, finally a book that offers reason in an age of insanity.  From suicide bombers to fundamentalist thugs, our world is swiftly being threatened.  The End of Faith by Sam Harris permits one to hope that we won't destroy ourselves before it's too late, that we will actually leave a world to our children's children and that man realizes first and foremost that we're all human beings. <br />A splended alternative to the Republican Convention. <br />
B00004SZWB|5.0|I love this album. Stevie is a wonderful talented artist. I love this whole album it contains some wonderful songs. My favorite songs on here is the remarkable song tribute to M.L.K. \\"Happy Birthday\\" I love this song. I love lately,All I do, Rocket Love, and Master Blaster Jammn'. This is a great album Stevie always does great work.
B00028HBKM|2.0|After viewing this movie am was left cold. <br /> <br />I have teared up for the Christ story many times, but this was not one of them. <br /> <br />First I'll tell you what I liked, then I will explain why the movie stinks so badly... <br /> <br />1. The language idea was fantastic. I enjoyed hearing the real languages and reading the sparce subtitles. <br /> <br />2. Costumes are great (except Jesus was draped in a Purple Robe... Jesus was not in this film, or if he was it was not possible to tell with the oozing blood all over his overbeaten body) <br /> <br />3. Camera work was good. Sets authentic. <br /> <br />1. Bad - Not based on the Bible. <br /> <br />2. Bad - Way too violent. <br /> <br />3. Bad - They try to make us feel sorry for Rome! Come on people... Gibson is trying to show us that Rome was good and Jews are bad! What a crock!  <br /> <br />Let's all just remember that the Church is actually ROME! (Heck, It is called the ROMAN Catholic Church!) <br /> <br />The Pope is nothing more than a Caesar. Rome hijacked the image of Jesus, warped his message and made hime look like a martyr for the world. (this begs the question... Did Jesus make it to heaven without being a Christian? Afterall, he was a Jew the day he died..) Let's try not to forget that Jesus was himself a Jew and his message was to be a better Jew. <br /> <br />This piece of work is more like a Nazi-Propaganda film than a piece of history. And I swear I heard the Jews yell \\"Seig Heil\\" instead of \\"Crucify Him\\"...  <br /> <br />Plaese everyone, try reading the Bible prior to viewing this piece of garbage! The story is a great one, but it lacks authenticity when made by people with anti-semetic agendas!
B000051VWW|5.0|THIS IS A PRETTY NICE ALBUM ESPECIALLY FOR A RETURN CD. MY FAVORITES ARE : BY YOUR SIDE, LOVERS ROCK, AND KING OF SORROW. I LIKE THIS ALBUM AND I ENJOY IT. IF YOU LIKE  SADE THEN I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS ALBUM IT IS PRETTY GOOD!!!!
B0002DB50E|1.0|Yeah, the box, extras and picture quality are amazing. BUT, the audio track is Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono(not even the 2.0 listed on amazon) - NO Dolby 5.1 or DTS at all! Guess Criterion said \\"let's preserve this the way it originally aired\\". All well and good, but they COULD have included an alternate 5.1/DTS track. And, yes, I did read the item description on amazon but there have been times where the description was lacking. Especially on new releases/special editions. Awesome image quality but would have been great to have sound coming out of all of my six speakers. Very sad and disappointing since this could have been a true '5 star' release. We'll probably not see another release of this classic and we're stuck with this mono version.
B000001GXJ|4.0|the plot of this story is too dense and convoluted for its 2hrs playing time. the overall structure is not bad. if you consider the prologue and the two scenes of act 1 to be separate acts, it's really a 5-act play a la shakespeare. and there are enough of subplots, plot twists, and contrasted characters to make a very good play. but it's not a play, it's an opera, which means a lot of the lines that would have been in the play are omitted and replaced by choruses, repeated sung verse, and orchestral music -  ie, things that don't add to the telling of the story. what's sacrificed are things like characterization, character development, and drawing the historical backdrop. the backdrop is especially important since it explains the characters' political motivations, something you can't assume will be understood since no-one can be expected to know anything about 14th century italian city-state politics. characterization and development are also sacrificed. simon boccanegra, in particular, is given short shrift. here is a man who loses a lover, a daughter, a friend, and then finally his life, yet the overall impression you get is that he's a decent guy who was just plain unlucky. he isn't portayed as the tragic character that he should be. there isn't enough depth to his character. we don't feel his pain. and he never changes. he just moves from one tragic event to another until he finally dies. somehow i think shakespeare would have done more with this story.<br />also, the musical style is a little uneven. for the most part, sb is written in the open form that verdi adopted in his other late operas, like falstaff and otello. but there are moments when it sounds like 'il trovatore' is about to break out, when you can still hear verdi's old closed-form style. <br />having said all this, the music is still very enjoyable and there are moments of beauty and lyricism, like in the duet between simon and his daughter in the first act.<br />good, but not a masterpiece on the order of aida or otello.

B00013F38K|3.0|The purpose of Widescreen, Letterbox or Full Screen DVD's should be to preserve the original ratio of a movie or series. Why make the mistake of making a Full Screen original in Letterbox? <br />I hoped movie industry executives will come to their senses one day. <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'm growing pretty tired of hearing how Gibson went \\"over the top\\" and made the movie to violent. <br /> <br />WHAT?!?!?!? <br /> <br />The movie is about Jesus being crucified.  If he'd have merely whipped him once or twice and pushed him to the ground a couple times, you'd get the atheist know it all on here making profound claims like, \\"I got treated worse in grade school\\" and \\"big deal, so he got hit a couple times.\\"  People today have the luxury of not watching someone get beat to death.  I think when people walked out of the theater, they felt what Jesus went through, not just witnessed him get called names and hit a couple times.   <br /> <br />Mel made a movie about Jesus Christ, not Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer. <br /> <br />Of all the violent films over the past few years, why is this one the movie labeled as \\"REALLY violent?\\"  Simple, it deals with religion and atheists have to find a reason to belittle it. <br /> <br />Ok... I'm off my soapbox.  The movie is spectaculor.  When your kids get a little older, sit with them and watch it.  While your at it, have them watch the documentary about 9/11.  9/11 also brought people back to faith. <br /> <br />-Mc
B00006AUIG|5.0|Horror movies usually don't faze me.  Often the only things horrible about them are their bad plots, worse acting, and over-reliance on visual effects.  For every classic \\"John Carpenter's The Thing\\", there's a dozen grating \\"Friday the 13th\\" type splatter-fests.  However, \\"Session 9\\" belongs in the rare category of a horror movie that does justice to its genre.<br /><br />The story is simple: A privately-owned HAZMAT company is tasked with cleaning up a deserted insane asylum.  The boss agrees to the contract under desperate financial circumstances, and it's one more burden on his already fragile psyche.  Soon, the facility's oppressive atmosphere begins to affect the team, and terrible events occur.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal too many specifics, since ignorance is a plus when viewing \\"Session 9.\\"  A movie has to be something special to push my primal emotional buttons, and this one does it in spades.  As I watched the story unfold, a creeping sense of dread began to grow within me, for a couple of reasons.  First, I cared about the characters enough to hope (and fear) for their safety.  That's a credit to the actors' fine performances within a well-crafted plot.  Second, laughable CGI monsters or other such cinematic cop-outs aren't on hand to provoke cheap thrills.  The use of sound and lighting to create an oppressive atmosphere of impending doom are masterful.  I often felt unsettled by the asylum itself, a real-life abandoned facility that was a character in its own right.  Finally, details are used to great effect, if one looks out for them.  For example, a number of ordinary snapshots figure into the plot.  But in the context of their viewing, the over-lit subjects, surrounded by a clutching darkness, add to the overall malevolence and despair of the proceedings.  Whoever directed \\"Session 9\\" knows how to work a person's imagination, and for that he's to be commended.<br /><br />A previous reviewer slammed \\"Session 9\\" as just another \\"possession\\" flick.  I don't agree.  Yes, such an assumption could be made based on the titular psychiatric session tapes, along with the shocking, brutal climax.  But the evil a murderous character manifests can just as well be the depraved side of human nature.  Somehow that's scarier than an overt supernatural threat.  Add the unnerving use of voice effects that made me imagine events more terrible than if they were shown, and I was freaked out enough to hope for daylight. As a result, I've avoided a repeat viewing of \\"Session 9.\\"  It's almost too real for comfort.<br /><br />If you want a fluff \\"horror\\" movie for fun and a couple of amusement-ride scares, then go get the \\"Scream\\" trilogy or its ilk.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But if you're looking for true horror, something that will make you turn on the lights and find a friend for comfort, then \\"Session 9\\" will do.  However, you may discover that it does its job a bit too well.  \\"Session 9\\" is a thinking person's horror movie.  Just make sure you avoid thinking about it in the dark.on\\" flick.

B000067FP7|5.0|I've loved Gremlins since I was a wee girl of only about 5 or 6, and previously my only copy of the film was a tattered VHS, worn out and almost grainy from repeated viewings. I purchased Gremlins on DVD and was astonished at how beautiful the transfer from film to DVD was. The details are crystal clear and the sound is impeccable. Certain small visual details of the movie were totally lost on my old VHS, but stand out gorgeously on this DVD.<br /><br />The movie itself doesn't need further praise from me - it's fun and funny, gory and touching at the same time. My personal favorite scene is when all of the Gremlins are in the movie theater, singing \\"Hi Ho\\" right along with the dwarves in Snow White. The special effects are amazing for the time, the score was perfect, and Gizmo never ceases to be adorable. A must-buy.
0316666343|5.0|I waited far too long to read this book. When I finally started it I couldn't believe how into it I got. Just by the second chapter I was hooked and that is rare. I love the sense of humor the author has and I'm really looking forward to reading more.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have one question for the guy from MN who gave this film a one star rating--what does your review have to do with this movie?  You have not said anything worthwhile that would make me want or not want to see this movie.  This film deserves five stars because it is a work of art by Mel Gibson that accurately portrays the passion of Jesus Christ.  It will move you.  Everyone needs to see this film.  I cheer Mel for having the courage and drive to see this film to completion.  Thanks Mel!
B00028HBKM|1.0|(...) Inspirational, it isn't.  I mean they really had the guy on the ropes.  Well, actually, maybe it is inspiring.  I mean I get worked over so bad on the basis daily that it really kind of cheers me up to see somebody getting worked over much worse.<br />Of course it kind of interferes with one's ability to take the movie seriously that the characters behave with such vaudevillian exaggeration that they seem to be playing to a gallery of nine-year-olds.  Subtle the Israelites were not, apparently.  And then there's the fact that the entire action of the movie is Jesus getting messed up.  Its like a movie that consists of one, very protracted, very one-sided, fight scene.  An action movie of the most lugubrious sort.<br />But the real question every Christian needs to ask themselves is, would they have followed Jesus if they had been around him at that time and place?  I'm guessing the answer is no.  As for Smell Gibson, I think he needs to stop taking himself so seriously and let somebody else have a crack at it.  This is really just a B movie that you seem to walk into the middle of.  Why no teachings of Jesus?  Why no childhood of Jesus?  Because, my friend, that simply is not good box office.  Whaddre we making here, some kind of chick flick?  No, lets get right to the gory part and stay there.  Can't miss.  See, its not really important what Jesus actually taught, its just important that he got worked over real bad. Why?  Because no teenager is gonna go see a Bible movie unless its full of violence.  Smell Gibson, if he were present at the time of Christ, would have been selling tickets to the crucifixion. It is impossible to deny, because that is precisely what he is doing here.  What was that Jesus said, \\"It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven\\"?  Oh, I forgot, lets not obsess on what Jesus may or may not have said.  Lets just get some popcorn and a couple of big gulps that we smuggled in from 7-11 and enjoy the splatterfest.<br />addition 9-05-04: The problem with Christianity, said G.K. Chesterton, was not that it has been tried and found wanting, but that it has been found difficult and left untried.  Let me repeat that.  It has been found difficult and left untried.  Found DIFFICULT AND LEFT UNTRIED.  Am I getting through to you now?  Nobody is actually following Christ's teachings because this is a highly inconvenient thing to do.  Jesus said, \\"you cannot follow both me and money.\\"  And yet here we see multimillionaire Smell Gibson coming on all pious.  Jesus said, \\"Resist not evil.\\"  And he walked his talk by getting crucified.  Again, highly inconvenient teachings.  Gee, what to do... uhhh, how about we just pick and choose what we like the sound of and then sort of bandy that stuff around while we collect brownie points for going to church and sitting there like a bump on a log?  Looks like we're all set.<br />Addition 9-10-04:  Consider also, the title of the film.  The Passion of The Christ.  This phraseology is inescapably vulgar.  First, I believe one is supposed to get the wrong idea: \\"Yeah, Christ sure was passionate.\\"  Or, better yet, \\"Gee, I didn't know that Jesus got lucky.  Is this a French film?\\"  Joe Six Pack is supposed to go wandering inno the theater expecting a stag reel.  But lets say the audience gets wised up and then no longer expects a stag film - like right about the time they're driving the nails through his palms.  Then the title becomes a commodification of Christ's crucifixion.  THE Passion of THE Christ.  Any way we could get the word \\"the\\" inno that title a few more times?  How about \\"The Passion of the the the Christ\\"  Then again maybe we should just buy an album by The The.7-11 and enjoy the splatterfest.  addition 9-05-04: The problem with Christianity, said G.K.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Again, Moore skews the facts to create the illusion of being a real documentary.  But he cuts up footage and uses answers to one question to answer a different question.  The facts have all been challenged and found a lie.  Also, a documentary provides both sides to an issue and lets the viewer decide.  This is an anti-American propaganda film.   <br /> <br />He took an anti-American film to the most anti-American country in the world and won an award.  Wow... big shocker there.   <br /> <br />As far as politics are concerned, Moore won't go on any shows that won't give him a list of questions before hand for a reason.  He's a dolt and not only has no education beyond what he cheated through in high school, but has no political background just like the other wacko hollywood types. <br /> <br />Better cling to this DVD.  When Bush wins 4 more years, this is all you'll have to get you through your crying fits at night. <br /> <br />I'd have give this less than 1 star due to it not being factual but Amazon wouldn't let me. <br /> <br />p.s.  I think Blair Witch Project had more facts in it!

0385510438|4.0|Grisham tells an intriguing, captivating story in The Last Juror.  It had several stereotypical yet enjoyable characters.  The time and setting of the novel are conducive to an interesting plot with several conflicts and twists.<br /><br />There are some cliche's here though that lessen the impact of the novel.  For example, the evil Padgitt family that lives by itself on the island and rarely ventures into town, the redneck sheriffs and gool ol' boys around town.  But I'm sure they are founded in truth.<br /><br />Grisham follows through on this story and closes well (unlike The King of Torts which fizzles at the end).  It is a good, entertaining read that has more than a little humor and good wit thrown into the mix.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|i cant wait to go to my local best buy/target/blockbuster/suncoast/ well really wherever i am when this hits the shelves, and get this 3-disc set to replace my soon to be inferior single disc \\"collectors\\" edition <br />A movie and from what im hearing A+ packaging
B0002I831S|4.0|Landmark television. <br /> <br />When StarTrek first aired in September 1966, no one had any idea of the social legacy it would come to represent in the decades to come.  Gene Roddenberry's brave conception of playing out humanity's struggles onto a metaphorical spaceship was deviously bold.  In fact, Roddenberry's brilliance probably was not realized until it was tweaked with the film StarTrek IV and The Next Generation series. <br /> <br />StarTrek possessed a social conscience disguised as entertainment.  A woman of color was on the bridge, the \\"Prime Directive\\" was the rule, and good superceded evil.  Meanwhile, back on 1966 Earth, Dr. King risked his life to advance the definition of \\"freedom,\\" youth began to seriously question authority, and two nuclear superpowers threatened each other with an expensive and anxious Cold War. <br /> <br />Despite its low-budget production, Roddenberry and his rainbow coalition of actors make up for in substance what they lacked in props.  Performance excellence comes through in crisp DVD to compensate for otherwise laughable alien-beings portrayed by a person in a zip-up costume.  Along with StarTrek's creative genious, the original, primary cast must be credited with the successful nearly four-decade StarTrek franchise. <br /> <br />The eight-disc set is a long-awaited tribute and record of StarTrek's maiden season.  The interactive menus are clever and even offer a very quaint original television preview of each episode.  Yes, the episodes are in the order in which they originally aired but are clearly marked in case the viewer chooses to watch in chronological order.  This reviewer has subtracted one star for the package design. An outer, yellow plastic case opens like Pac Man to reveal a rather flimsy disc case bound together at one end by a wide piece of scotch tape.   <br /> <br />Despite the packaging, this DVD set is worth the price considering the number of entertainment hours it contains.  Even the most lukewarm StarTrek fan can appreciate this DVD set because it represents one of television's most bold programing moves that sadly seem non-existent today.
B000002UAX|1.0|Garbage! Pure, unadulterated Garbage! This is music for lame-os who sit in their libraries drinking tea and discussing philosiphy. The beatles my foot!

B0002IQNAG|5.0|I just want to say ALL of the DEAD movies are cool.  But I am really looking forward to Anchor Bay's new 4-Disc Ultimate Edition of DAWN - this movie has all the right ingredients of a true classic horror film, from the beginning to the very end, with scares, excitement, and special effects that are out-of-this-world. Sure, it may not have CGI Effects, like most film today, but that's what makes it so cool.  In my opinion, the best scary movies came from the days when it all had to be done with your bare hands (so to speak). <br /> <br />This Ultimate Edition should not be missed by true fans of Romero and/or the DEAD films.  Get ready!  DAWN OF THE DEAD is back on DVD, with a vengeance!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I love this cd!!! There is not one song i don't like.  I listen to her cd every day, especially since i broke up with my boyfriend. i don't know what i'd do without it. i was a big fan of avril's last cd but this is so much better. i recommend this cd to everyone, especially if your going through a bad breakup.
B000066NW0|1.0|This album sucks!! How can anyone like this crap? Avril sucks at singing and can't even play a guitar!!!! For good music listen to Lacuna Coil, Hatebreed, Dimmu Borgir, From Autumn To Ashes, Suffocation, Crimson Thorn, Vomitorial Corpulence, etc. I don't really need to say anything else.
1592400876|5.0|I have never submitted a review, but after reading a couple nasty (bad) reviews, I decided to write this good one.  I read Lynne's book this summer and I really liked it.  I read quite a bit of all kinds of books.  I thought it was really funny.  I really liked her sense of humor.  It was entertaining and helped me brush up on my punctuation.  Great job Lynn Truss.  Also, I don't care what anyone says, I love the title!
B00008DDSC|5.0|Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader's performances are both quite funny and also quite painful to watch.  That both characters are able to overcome their self-hatred and -disgust by loving one another in a way that accepts, rather than negates, their sadistic-masochistic habits is wonderfully optimistic.
B0000630BT|5.0|There is no screwing around by the band here. Maybe one of the songs on PAINKILLER resembles something of a sing-a-long radio hit [A Touch of Evil] which have thus far always been good to balance this group's albums. But every other song shreds with pummeling double bass and the guitars are much more sinister than anything so far from these guys... up till this. Oh... Halford sounds like his voice has gotten even stronger and more wretchedly high pitched (you notice this from the first song, the title track.) Power metal gods become brilliant thrash

0393035158|5.0|Having read Mr. Harris's excellent op/ed in the Los Angeles Times called \\"Holy Terror:  Religion isn't the solution; it's the problem\\", I immediately bought and devoured his book.  The primary experience in reading it was one of relief.  Not since Bertrand Russell has a writer put into words what so many reasonable people feel in their hearts about religion and yet so seldom see in print, especially in this country which is becoming more scarily religious by the day.  And it is a brave act to have done so since its clear articulation of the disasters of religion--past, present, and future--will surely incite the faithful and put them in a burn-em-at-the-stake kind of mood (as evidenced by some of the other reviews for this book on Amazon). The End of Faith offers sane alternatives for cultures to live harmoniously together rather than attempting to salvage anything from Bronz Age religious myths that require an almost willful stupidity, are stifling to the spirit, and are making us continue to murder in the name of our gods.  Kudos to Mr. Harris, a courageous and honest man.
B000002JSP|4.0|All in all, In Through the Out Door is a pretty good album.  After reading the other reviews on this album, I was expecting it to be my least favorite Zeppelin CD.  I was pleasantly surprised, however to find that it was right up there with Physical Graffiti and Houses of the Holy.  Seriously people, there is no such thing as a bad Led Zeppelin album.               <br />       The CD starts off with the classic In the Evening, and one of my new favorite songs, South Bound Saurez which is a fun little song based on a piano riff.  Fool in the Rain is another hit, and Hot Dog is a hilarious hillbilly-style song.  The next song, Carouselambra is definetely underrated.  Sure, it's long and has just a little too much keyboards, but it's nowhere near as bad as what the other reviews say it is.  In fact, I enjoy listening to it every time.  All my Love speaks for itself as one of Led Zeppelin's signature songs.  The last song on the last Zeppelin album was a bit of a surprise.  It's a great slow guitar/synthesizer ballad with a great tune (I still don't quite get exactly what Robert Plant is wailing about at the end, but still an awesome song).  I would recommend it to anyone who knows that they like Led Zeppelin.
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|This film made a very big impact on me in the sixties. I was living in London at the time and it captured a feeling that was in the air in the city at that time . It summed up the atmosphere in London for those of us who could not pinpoint or articulate what was going on behind all the \\"parties\\"that lasted through the night and the music and fashions. Everyone of a particular age wanted to be like David Hemnings or thought they were like David Hemmings. The feeling the film gave was that you could be like David Hemmings at your own level. You didn't need the Rolls Royce. All you really needed was an slr camera and some clothes.   I think that the true art of this picture is that it made you feel something. It made you really appreciate the time and the era that was then. I never get tired of watching it and even now after 35 years I still see now what I saw then.   I was very saddened by the death of David Hemmings and the realisation that time passes so quickly.
B00028HBKM|3.0|The Passion was a very interesting film. I have to say, that I really enjoyed it. I dont think that it's the greatest movie of the year, but it shure is the most interesting one. In some points I think that the movie was as cheesy and stupid as NBC's Passions but mostly it was fun. I didn't cry or anything and this movie didn't change my life and \\"touched\\" my soul at all.But I have to admit something... it kind of freaked me. That devil-thingy was really nasty looking, what was it anyway (male or female) and in that scene when it was holding that deformed baby thing was pretty nasty too and also the little demon children that were running after Judas (or is it Juda) anyway. the only question that I had was how could Mel Gibson take such a \\"beautiful\\" story and turn it to a \\"horror movie\\"... Oh, well it works for me! The scenes in wich Jesus  was getting beatten up and crucified didn't really disturb me (mostly because I had a handful of Reese's peanut-butter cups and I just love them. When I eat Reese's P C   I go to \\"Heaven\\"  and nothing can distract me.) Not even the people that were screaming and running out of the theaters with tears in their eyes. I was like \\"What did I miss?\\" Movies about religion always freak me out. I was traumatized for a year after seeing the \\"Exorcist\\" , but after the 10000 time of watching it I realized that  it had a deeper meaning that just all the screaming, puking and masturbating, it was a movie that had a touch of evil and a bigger \\"touch\\" of good. Kind of like this one .  But from all of the nasty, disgusting and traumatizing films that have a meaning of love and show us the power of the Lord, I have to say that the Exorcist was better. I am not religious i barely believe in the God that I am \\"suppose\\" to believe in (I'm a Christian-Orthodox. I'm Greek, He - He  unfortunately Greek's are cursed (they're dark and hairy like freakin' packy's) oh well... we cant have it all. Lets get back to the point.All the Jew's got pissed off with this film but they shouldn't of really cared.it's just a movie and nothing else, its not the actual Christ, its just an actor (and not a pretty good one if you ask me). No one really knows what exactly happened, so what makes people think that Mel knew? He just wanted money,and he got it (lucky bastard). Well Monica is in it so it's a good movie in my eyes! I am gonna' get the DVD tomorrow, I really don't know why (I didn't like the film that much and there aren't any special features in it (a special collectors edition is rumored to come out Christmas or Easter 2005) but I feel like something is pulling me towards it. well, you know what they say (if you have the money, buy it)! And that's what I intend on doing.
0060975768|1.0|When I think of this book and the movie made from it, I wonder how they did that. Trying to gather comprehensible, story-telling scenes for a motion picture from this jumble of poorly written hodgepodge would have been very difficult-hats off to the screenwriter.<br /><br />Admittedly I, who read at least one to two books a week, was unable to get more than halfway through this one. I pushed myself hard to finish it, but reading again and again about the major screwups by field officers which caused the deaths of so many men and the way the commander (author) never placed blame or showed criticism for those junior to him made me lose all interest. Perhaps later in the book Moore court-marshalled them all and everything came out well in the end. As an officer he may be among the great; as an author he should have found a good ghostwriter.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Boy this film sure can upset some people... :) <br /> <br />I was fortunate enough to see this movie at the cinema when it was released.  It was unbelievable!  To those too young to have seen it in the theater you dont know what you missed!  Also, cgi was non-existent (thank god) the FX were real makeup effects and clever editing.  The true talent of Romero's vision and Savini's excellent gore effects.. created a plethora of wannabes... Hence the term the golden age of gore.  To people used to MTV editing and CGI effects this film may seem slow.   <br />In its day this movie shocked and freaked out many a viewer, Hail to the King of Zombie movies.. George A. Romero! <br /> <br />I cant wait for this to arrive at my house! <br /> <br />D
B0002EXH4K|5.0|ive been a megadeth fan when peace sells and this REMASTER of CTE is great and its worth it, It sounds better,cool demos. <br /> <br />if your new with megadeth buy the original first then the remaster
B00028HBL6|5.0|I saw this movie when it opened in theaters and I have recently seen it again with the purchase of the DVD. Firstly I think you should realize that I am 17 years old. I am at an age in which the majority has an extremely liberal viewpoint. I can proudly say that I am neither politcally nor religously liberal.  People my age, many friends that I know, think it to be the thing to do in order to rebel. I just have to say that the 50's are over. What do we possibly need to rebel against? Good morals and a good sense of religion? These liberals should get a life.  <br /> <br />Upon saying that I will get to my review of this movie. I can honestly say that this movie is one of the greatest acheivments I have ever seen in my life. I am saying that as a Christian teenager. Mel Gibson should be awarded with something for his incredible risk and gambit that he took to make this movie. Gibson has become my favorite actor over the past year due to the way he does not bend to the liberal Hollywood higher ups and the fact that hes not ashamed to be slightly conservative in a place where 90% of people are not. The movie is an absolute triumph. Never before have I seen such a tale of courage, pain, anger, hope, passion, and anguish. After seeing this movie one fully understands what it means to be Christian.  You fully understand what our Lord went through for us. FOR US. Not for his own personal glory but to save US. Gibson shows this through the use of extraordianry acting, vivd landscape, incredible cinamatography and a score that is nonstop and absolutely fanstastic. The movie is absolutely gorgeous and if you read the Bible you will realize that it is just as good a depiction of the passion of Christ as anything ever before.   <br /> <br />This brings me to my next point. The Anti-Semetic ordeal that this movie went through. Yet another libearl bunch of crap. Im sick and tired of this Michael Moore type of Hollywood where everything, even the most passionate and hopeful storyever told, is put down. It is funny that Michael Moore's bundle of lies, Faranheit 9/11, gained better national reviews than The Passion. It is interesting to think that at the Academy Awards, Moore will probobly be nominated for best director when Gibson probobly will not be. But hey thats my own personal opinion. We conservatives are always wrong. I always keep forgetting that. Anyway back to the Anti-Semetic bull. This is most absurd, repulsive lie ever. This movie in no way is Anti-Semetic. Not in any way at all. All this movie is is truth. I think we have to get over this politically correct nonsense. Oh we dont want to offend the jews. Well maybe we should face the fact that YES the jews did hand Christ over to the Romans. YES the High Priests were scared that Christ would control the crowd. And if anything, its the Romans who look bad in this movie. They come off as absolute monsters. Just demonic, evil men who care about no one but themselves. Im so aggravated with the politically correct, liberal, democratic, ivy league BS this country is in right now. It makes me sick that I am in a huge minority when it comes to people my age and my beleifs. This movie represetns everything i stand for. It represents everything that good moral people stand for. It is a timeless masterpiece that will go down in history. And i very highly doubt that this movie will win any major awards because of the liberal leanings of the academy. Now THAT...is a sin.
B0000509C4|5.0|Why do people hate Creepshow 2? Well people hopefully you will like Creepshow 3 better.Because I just read an interview with George A. Romero about his next Dead film and he was asked what he wants to do after Land of the Dead his replied was \\"I like to do another Creepshow movie\\" I guess Stephen King will be getting a phone call from an old friend any day now? If Creepshow 3 does happen what King short story's will be in the new movie if it happens?<br /><br />As for the Creepshow 2,I always found it to be a good 80's movie full of dumb people,like the Indian teenage punk who thought he could get into movies because of his hair!and how many people would go swimming in a lake see a duck getting attacked and killed by something in the water and would not turn there butts right around and head right back to land!I would of.And that girl in the Hitchiker,what a dumb lady,she's cheating on her husband,she wakes up in her lovers bed to see the alarm clock blanking she panicks,gets in her car and trys to think of a lie she can give to her husband about where she's been\\"Lady it's so simple just tell him you could not sleep so you went for a car ride!\\" Then after she hits the Hichiker she gets terriozed by his ghost or Zombie? What ever the heck he was? Now how many people in there cars would be keeping all the doors in the car locked and the windows shut from a walking corpse?Not this dumb lady!And she keeps stoping! It seems like horror movies are always full of dumb people.Now Creepshow 2 is getting the Divimax treatment.How much better will the new version look over the previous version.I would like to see special features on Creepshow 2.I would like to know where that lake is in the Raft?I would like to go visit it,swim in it,then tell people I swam in the lake in Creepshow 2.I been to where they shot The Hitchiker,it was shut in Stephen Kings home town of Bangor Maine.Freinds of mine have wondered what was that thing in the Raft.Well in the short story version in Kings Book Skeleton Crew{I think that was the book?}The lake was on Government Land and that blob thing was a Science project for a war weapon,well thats what I think,it's been a long time since I read the story so I could be wrong?k Skeleton Crew{I think that was the book?}The lake was on Government Land and that blob thing was a Science project for a war weapon,well thats what I think,it's been a long time since I read the story so I could be wrong? <br /> <br />
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Alright, i'll begin by saying, I have owned Slipknot's first (the self-titled) CD for many years now and love it, and I still listen to it sometimes to this day. It was one of the best 'debut' albums i've ever heard and at the time I was blown-away by their sound.    However... now we come to \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses.\\" I was anticipating this CD after hearing Duality and having enjoyed their prior efforts, however, that being the only song I had heard from it prior to purchase was my mistake. I normally don't purchase CD's without downloading mp3's of various songs first to make sure i'll like most of it, however I had faith in Slipknot because of their first CD and bought it blindly. The most appropriate word I can come up to describe this third album is Mediocrity.     I really expected better from Slipknot.. They used to have a unique sound; almost every song on their old self-titled CD is intense/hardcore and really gets you amped. In \\"Subliminal Verses\\" everything sounds trite and re-hashed. Half the songs are weary, depressing, uninspired and filled with quasi-philosophical half-hearted moping, while the other half is \\"Softcore\\" Metal that you wouldn't be caught dead rocking out to. I don't use the words 'sell-out' lightly (obviously anyone selling records is trying to make money), but this is what I think happened: I have a suspicion that this album is the result the lead singer getting tired of having to scream loudly in every song (which over time from many concerts probably gave him migraines and vocal chord damage, etc). (...) They went a different direction with this CD, and it's evident from the first track. When it started playing I did not even realize it was Slipknot, I thought they had accidentally sent me the wrong CD of some random quasi-metal mainstream linkin park clone.    Sadly, that is what Slipknot has become. They made one song that is close to their hardcore roots (Duality) but that was the beginning of the end. You see, when I firstlisten to a new CD, I kinda skim through it. The first run though, I listen to the first minute or so of each song and if I like it i'll listen to the whole song, and if I think it's crap, I skip to the next track. With this CD, before I knew it I had skipped THE ENTIRE CD except for Duality. This CD is exactly like Korn's \\"Untouchables\\" to me, in that every song on it, except for the singles, is un-listenable.    (...)
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Big Fish is a terrific film that, once viewed, will leave you scratching your head as to why it was noticebly snubbed at the 2003 Academy awards.  It's GREAT, inventive, and packs an emotional wallop.   <br /> <br />Big Fish is the story of a family, essentially.  The father is a notorious teller of tall tales, and his son has had his fill of them.  The father is in his final days, and the son comes home at his mother's urging, hopefully to help bridge the gaps in their relationship, and to maybe help the son 'get' his father, who he can't understand. <br /> <br />In typical Burton fashion, this movie has visuals that can be larger than life.  However, in context of this story, it works SO well, as the backstory for a man whose life itself may be larger than legend would have is perfect.  The set design and cinematography lend such a surreal quality to tales that may or may not be tall.  It provides a world that have just enough realism to keep the audience wondering 'Hmmm...maybe he's NOT exaggerating.' <br /> <br />By far, this film is Burton's best work yet.  I've found Burton throws people into two camps, 'Love him' or 'Hate him.'  This is definitely a middle of the road Burton that can easily be watched by non-Burton fans, because the story of Father-son estrangement is universal, and Burton's storytelling gives the highly emotional subject enough whimsy to make it enjoyable, but never loses the powerful emotions of the characters and should easily move the most hardened heart with it's interesting examination of parent/child relationships. <br /> <br />This really is a can't miss addition to one's collection, and I can highly recommend it to those who like films with emotional punch and stories that make you think.  An added bonus, is that you will find you need to rewatch it several times to pick up subtle nuances the tall tales tell. <br /> <br />
B00005JN2F|5.0|The Bourne Supremacy is the greatest movie I've ever seen. If you liked The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy will knock your socks off. There's the perfect amount of action, everything is perfect about The Bourne Supremacy. Matt Damon is great as Jason Bourne no one would have been better in this role. GO TO THIS MOVIE, PAY MONEY IT IS THAT GOOD. If your like action, if you liked The Bourne Identity you will not be disapointed!!!
0790744295|5.0|Warner this movie is a horror classic.The first DVD release was a slap in the face to fans.This movie is crying out for a new DVD version.On the new DVD get Stephen King,George A. Romero,and Tom Savani together in a room and record a commentary track,it would be the best horror commentary ever.You know if Anchor Bay had there hands on this movie we probably would of had a Special Edition by now.It would also be nice to see new Interviews with stars Ed Harris,Ted Danson, and even Stephen King as Jordy Varrel.This movie is well over 20 years old and it has never had a Special edition release on video,and I dont know why?It was a huge hit on video.I think fans should write letters to Warner Bros about a new version of Creepshow?It's a horror classic! As the father in Father's Day would say \\"I want my special Edition DVD Bedelia?!\\"
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is my personal favorite Beatles album and really shows once again what simply AWESOME and AMAZING music they can make.

B00005JKHN|1.0|This - in thirty year retrospect - is a dismally poor production. <br /> <br />The script, so to speak, is laughable and way below Disney's norm. <br /> <br />The artwork is terribly disappointing. Worse than CGI graphics today. Everything two-dimensional and static - like watching bad reruns of Clutch Cargo cartoons. Even the backgrounds lack depth and interest. <br /> <br />Yes, there are colorful displays of fireworks, at times. An easy feat to accomplish.  <br /> <br />Overall - avoid this at all cost in favor his earlier works - any of them. This production shames Disney from beginning to end - and the 'extras' are a joke.
B000003TA4|5.0|I have been into music for only a sort period of time, but this record is truly incredible and one of the best that I have ever heard.  Kurt's lyrics are spectacular in comparison to the work of today and from works of the past.  My favorite song of nirvana on this album has to be \\"drain you.\\"  The melody and lyrics are out of this world.  \\" With eyes so dialated, I've become your pupil. You've taught me everything without a poison apple.\\"  The insight and introspect that you must have to create something that incredible, he has to be one of if not the greatest songwriter of our time.  <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson brings up the most graphic & realistic portrayal of the sufferings of Christ. It was truly inspirational and thought provoking. Never before have Biblical events been brought to such life...until now. The movie will have you do a lot of soul searching.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Nick Stahl's acting is somewhat wooden - I'd rather have seen the actor from T2 return - and Linda Hamilton's presence is sorely missed but T3 still entertains. Ah-nold hasn't lost anything as the killer robot and \\"is back\\" with more great lines, and the story still thrills.....Judgement Day is on and can't be stopped. Worth watching. Check it out.
0786867973|4.0|Bought this to add to my limited cook book shelf. I use this for inspiration,  Last night I had pizza dough and wanted to make calzone/something. By looking at three pages of rescipes, I knew what I could make with what I had in the fridge, potatoe, spinach, cheese mushroom  with pesto sauce was the happy result.<br />The writer likes \\"tall\\" food, so she uses her springform pan endlessly, it makes for good pictures. I do not need another pan, so I substitute pans a lot with fine results.<br />Will I keep this book? The pictures often inspire me to cook.<br />I am adding to this review 8 months later. I have changed my mind, I really like this cookbook! It has some wonderful cakes and a fantatstic, simple chocolate cake that my family adores.I drag it off the shelf for inspiration and have a tasty dessert on the table in a hour. I would not give up my copy for anything.
B000003TAR|5.0|This was the climax and at the same time the heart of nirvana.  They could have done another pop album similar to nevermind or they could create a album that they would be proud of.  They obiviously chose the latter and they recieve praise from their true fans.  This album is incredible, because they held to their artistic conscious and also it has amazing melodies and introspective lyrics.  Honestly this album has a great variety of tunes from the harder songs like tourette's to the softer all apologies, nirvana truly came into their own with this album.  Honestly kurt was inclined to create a paradox inyour mind while he could also lull you with his fantastic melodies.  Truly he is one of if not the greatest songwriter of our time.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|i have been waiting for this kind band since i learned how to walk
B00004TRD8|5.0|Get rid of the old VHS tapes - hasta la vista, baby! - this DVD gives you in-theater quality and awesome sound!!! Linda Hamilton still thrills as (...) mother of future world saviour John Connor, and Arnold just gets more and more buffed as the rabid robot hitman. No problemo recommending this as the best of the series and worth the buy
0679777547|4.0|Alright, so please don't shoot me, but I didn't love it.  Maybe I just need to get over the fact that if I spend the rest of my life looking for another Flanders Panel, I'm just not going to find it.  I guess what we think of books depends a lot on what's happening when we read them, and I loved that book.  From the description of the Club Dumas, I really thought it was going to be similar, and maybe my disappointment is more about my expectations than this novel's merits. <br /> <br />Anyway, I read Dumas back to back with the Nauatical Chart, and I had almost the exact opposite reaction to the two novels.  With Nautical Chart, I could see all of its flaws while I was reading it, and many of them were severe.  It distracted me the whole way, and I tried not to let it get me down, and even now I can list them to you and in an objective way understand why some of them were pretty unforgivable.  But at the end of that book, I had a smile on my face and have many fond feelings for it. <br /> <br />Club Dumas was the exact opposite.  It is breathtaking in places.  The author maneuvers around the interwoven tales so deftly and subtly that while you are reading, you understand you are holding a work of a man with considerable skills reserved for few.  Corso is an amazingly likeable fellow, and the book plays to all of Perez-Reverte's strengths -- parallel detective stories that span multiple generations and interrelate in surprising and interesting ways.  (Interestingly, he tried something similar in Nautical Chart, as is not surprising since it's something of his trademark, but did not succeed nearly as well.)  The places Corso takes us are interesting; the people he meets are extraordinary creations, and the marriage of the Dumas theme with the quest of the strage characters he encounters is just great. <br /> <br />One also should applaud Perez-Reverte for the sheer ambitiousness of the project.  He is plainly channeling Umberto Eco at every crucial juncture, as otherreviewers have noted, and even where it is a conscious homage, he basically shoots for the top and hits his mark.  The penultimate scene easily could be something right out of Foucault's Pendulum.  <br /> <br />But, what can I say, I didn't love it.  It left me unsatisfied at the end.  I tired of some of the repetitive elements.  I started losing interest.  I had a little bit of sense at the end that the author had played a trick on me.  I also thought some of the threads that I thought were so carefully woven together unravelled a little.  (Although, I admit to not being nearly smart enough to understand about half -- if not more -- of the underlying stuff that the author was getting in there.)   <br /> <br />The bottom line is that I was prepared to give this book between two and three stars, which is actually a pretty bad review for me.  But I bumped it up for two reasons.  First, the ambitiousness -- gotta give a guy credit for really shooting for the moon even if you don't think he got there.  Second, and more important, there is one part of the book that is just priceless -- Corso's visit to old guy (forget his name) who is basically destitute and has to sell his beloved books off one at a time to survive and pay his taxes, while his estate turns to squalor.  I really liked that character and those 30 pages are so were as entertaining to me as many full novels.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I have spent the last few days listening to this band- but it only took the first listen through to hear the influences of The Damned and The Jam- not to mention harmonizing and vocals reminiscent of Adam and the Ants and even some Public Image Limited.  There is, no doubt, a nod to many 80's bands, but these guys took their driving force from some of the most energetic bands of that decade.  But the best part of all is it's original- and yes, it's Pop, but tell me there is good pop out there worth listening to and I'll call you a liar.   <br /> <br />Like the Trashcan Sinatras, and of course more modernly, Belle and Sebastian, Scotland is no wonder turning out bands like FF because of it's remarkable beauty- in its people and culture.  <br /> <br />But the music- thrashing, bouncing guitars with repeated lyrics and verses that would make the B-52's giggle.  Smartly dressed with all the irony of Madness and the Pet Shop Boys, this band is sheer, unadulterated FUN!  If you can appreciate where the music came from, but prefer to live in this decade- and not that one- this is your \\"Album of the Year\\".  Also- see The Postal Service.  VERY FUN STUFF!
B000002JS6|5.0|In my opinion there is nothing more \\"Rock & Roll\\" then a band full of wild, hard rocking Australians swinging guitars and screaming at the top of their lungs. The type of music that your parents are afraid to let you listen to for the fact that it is charged with so much adrenaline that god knows what kind of mood it will put you in. When AC/DC released Back In Black in 1980, the album consisted of ten of the hardest rock songs ever released. <br />The first track on the album was titled Hells Bells. The song starts off with a very creepy sounding of bells, but about a minute into the song the lyrics come in and the rocking begins.  <br />One of the most popular songs on the album, and a song that will go down in rock and roll history as one of the best, was You Shook Me All Night Long. The song was based on a certain girl who had an effect on the lead singer, and she shook him all night long. As you listen to the song, and how he describes the girl you can get a sense that shes really something special, unlike anyone else. <br />The final track on the album is a type of political statement telling people that Rock and Roll Aint Noise Pollution. The song calls for everyone listening to come and stand up against the people who complain about their hard style of thunderous guitars and heart pounding drums. They make it very eminent that rock and roll is here to stay and that it aint never gonna die. <br />Once the album has played all the way through it leaves you wanting more and more, as if you could play it over and over everyday for the rest of your life. The music has a way of grabbing you and holding on for dear life and it comes inside of you. This album is one of my all time favorites, and will always be in my CD player, no matter where or when; it will always be the supreme album for all rock and roll. <br />
B0002CTSW2|5.0|~As a Christian I found the Passion of the Christ to be one of the most touching and accurate movies portraying the suffering of Christ. I usually don't go to the movie theatres that much but I went twice to see this one. The DVD is alright but all you get from it is just the movie no extras. I would have loved to see interviews with the cast and Mel Gibson as well as see the movie trailer, but none of these exist on the DVD unfortunetly. Either way I would highly recommend the DVD to everyone~~ out there becuae the message it displays is life changing and reminds us about what really matters in life.~
0790749815|5.0|I have seen this movie several times, and now dating myself, I watched it at the show as a very young child. Actually this film gets better. As a collector of Hitchcock films this ranks with some of his best. It's difficult for me to separate each film into a Top 10.<br /><br />If you enjoy thrillers, and bone-chilling suspense the scenes in this movie will satisfy your pleasures. The acting is suberb and makes me long for the old movies time and again.<br /><br />You can't go wrong viewing this movie....more than once!! It's a Top Ten (10) in the action/suspense category. Get your snacks lined up and don't answer the phone during this classic!!
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I usually like to read the book before I see the movie based on it - so I bought \\"Big Fish\\" the book when I heard they were making a movie about it. I was pretty disappointed - I just couldn't get interested. <br /> <br />The movie, on the other hand, is much more intriguing. I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan, but he did a great job of capturing the magic that I must have missed in the book. The acting is quite good - with the exception of Albert Finney, who seems to have had a stroke or something - his diction was slurred and his mouth looks funny. Ewan McGregor is terrific, and Jessica Lange is, as someone already said, luminous but somehow wasted in this role.  <br /> <br />And the story about finding yourself and creating a relationship with your father as an adult - when his stories haven't changed but you have - will strike a chord with those of you who are facing the aging and death of your own parents. Apparently Tim Burton's father died either just before or while he was making this movie - which made it rather more poignant for me.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Imagine being layed up with a broken leg, bored out of your wits, sitting in your \\"Flat\\" and then suddenly......You have witnessed a crime. Or did you? How can you convince anyone? Is your mind playing tricks on you?<br /><br />Rear Window is classic Hitchcock with James Stewart playing a superb part of news photographer, suddenly helpless, peering out his Greenwich Village apartment \\"Rear Window\\", delegating instructions to his girlfriend, Grace Kelly and involving his detective friend, Wendall Corey. The plot unfolds slowly and dramatically. If you bite your fingernails then tape them up before watching this masterpiece!
0452285186|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, but it has hardly made me smile... I wouldn't recommend it at all.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I just saw Josh Groban in concert, here in Vancouver, and I felt compelled to support him in any way possible. His performance was incredible, actually I don't think I can find the word to describe it exactly. Believe it or not his voice is better LIVE!!!! And I'm not saying that he sounds bad on CD, he sounds amazing in this CD but his vocals are so strong that at the concert you sense the power vibrate within you. It was like he was right beside me, amazing! This CD is fantastic, I've listened to it non-stop in preparation for the concert tonight, and I never got sick of it. His next single, and my favorite song &quot;Remember when it rained&quot; (co-wrote by Groban himself) is such a moving song, all his songs are, but this one touches a special place in my heart. Also, this CD, as well as new songs, is filled with the favorites, such as the Italian love song &quot;Caruso&quot;. Let me tell you, one of the best of the many, many who have sung it. You cannot be a romantic and not love this song. It was neat because at the concert he translated the words to the verses, and it just re-enforced what masterpiece that song really is. Many people find him bland for singing stereotypical operatic songs, but these people fail to hear the words or the fabulous talented ensemble Groban has put together. His sound is fresh, because it's not just violin, it's fantastic drumming, percussion, piano, guitar and bass. There are many who can appreciate this such beautiful artistic compellation. Besides many of the songs are new songs. What an unforgettable experience, now to be revisited every time I reach for this CD.
B000066NW0|1.0|ever hear avril \\"sing\\" live on mtv? she stinks. <br /> <br />this girl cant sing. she cant play guitar. her record company hires people to write her music for her.  <br /> <br />nuff said.
B0000027RL|5.0|Hmm... Where to begin with this CD? <br /> <br />Being one of my personal favs, I, of course, gave it a 5... Why wouldn't I? It's a truly amazing album! If there was ONE flaw, I'd have to say... Hmm.. Yellow Ledbetter should've been on it instead of Why Go... Y.L. is so intensely beautiful... I'm glad it's on Lost Dogs. <br /> <br />Okay, on to the tracks.. <br /> <br />Once- Ed's intense growling makes me just want to dance around, screaming, \\"YEAH BABY!!! UH HUH!\\"... Or run into a pole... Either one's fine with me! 9/10 <br /> <br />Even Flow- As hard as I try, no other song can make me smile as much as this one does when I hear it. Great, GREAT song. Sweet interlude on this one, too... 10/10 <br /> <br />Alive- CLASSIC song. Eddie's voice works perfectly with the guitar on this one. The lyrics make me want to cry... He's such a poetic, lyrical genius....  10/10 <br /> <br />Why Go?- GREAT drumming on this song... It doesn't get stuck in my head as much as the others on the CD, but it's still quality work.. I love Ed's growl. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Black- Staind should rot in hell for trying to cover this....  Beautiful song, beautiful lyrics, Eddie's amazing voice... why would it NOT get a 10/10? <br /> <br />Jeremy- Watch the video. Vedder's the man. One of my very favorite Pearl Jam songs EVER. 'Nuff said. 11/10. <br /> <br />Oceans- A lot of people get really turned off by the high-pitched vocals in the chorus, but I think it just adds to the passion of the song... Beautiful voice in this one. 8/10. <br /> <br />Garden- This was my FAVORITE PJ song for a while... The harmonies just make me want to cry... GREAT chorus.. Best I've heard since.. Oh.. I don't know.. Even Flow? ... 10.5/10 <br /> <br />Deep- A head-bangin song.. Made me want to pound a hole 'deep' in the floor with a jackhammer.. Not that that's a BAD thing... Nonono!! I like pounding things!  Great, loud song for the rockers. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Release- Probably the masterpiece of this album.. Thisshould've been a single.. It would've showed the world how beautifully adverse this group really is. They can go from a rocker like \\"Deep\\" to a wonderful, slow, haunting song like 'Release'? Great, very pretty song. Made me cry the first time I heard it. 11/10. <br /> <br />Overall, this is one of the best albums I own, and one of the greatest alt. rock albums of all time... DEFINETLY worth your money. Truly a rock masterpiece. <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|the first half is really boring and full of murky cinematography. you dont even get to the gory parts till halfway through, but then it really gets bloody. i kinda got off on it from then on. but if you want gross gore all the way through, without all that phony drama, check out i spit on your grave, dead alive, and evil dead. they are ALL GORE. oh yeah, theres a bunch of silly religious stuff in this movie, but we arent supposed to take that seriously. its just a cover, so mels little snuff flick wouldnt get an nc-17 rating. thats a pretty shrewd maneuver by mad mel but it lets us splatter fans down. like i said, skip the pretense and go for the true gore. i spit on your grave, dead alive, and evil dead...those are the movies of choice for the true connoisseur of legal snuff.
B000002LOE|4.0|If you are looking to put together an REM collection, or just looking for some good music this is a definite must have.  I disagree with other reviews on the so called 'dated' sound of this album.  This is REM at their best.  And while it does sound like early '90s pop, it should, it is.  While this album is ripe with REM favorites; Radio Song, Losing My Religion and Shiny Happy People; every song is golden.  A well balanced, well mixed, must have for any pop audiophile.

B0000640RX|4.0|\\"Back then I could fly a chopper, drive a tank, and handle million dollar machinery, now I can't hold down a job washing cars\\". So speaks a tearful John Rambo at the end of the first of these three memorable action flicks (although it could be a page from Ted Kotcheffs resume now). Embittered, lost and victimized by an uncaring donut munching hick sherrifs department, he goes on the rampage and is saved from a Bonnie and Clyde exit in the nick of time by Richard Crenna. For me this was the high point and best movie of the trilogy, it was fresh, raw and inventive and what followed in the next two installments was just all out testerone bathed indulgence. So why recommend the set? well it's kind of like cookies without milk if you don't, and they're a good value price. The reproduction is crisp, and the transition to DVD is tastefully graced with some nice extra's. In part two, Rambo is liberated from prison and dropped in to rescue MIA's from pinko commy subversive's (and some home grown double dealing)and then moves on to Afghanistan in part 3 to save the World from even more enemys of the free World. The acceptable twisted morality of the movies has always amazed me, in so far as the villians are painted as so heinous, as to justify ANY means to bring them to justice by our hero. As has been said many times by others, an overwhelming body count, lots of bare torso muscle flexing, die hard action, and enough ammo to make an arms dealer blush all add to the meld. More than a little outdated, but still a great homage to the action era of the 80's and early 90's, it STILL has good repeat viewability. Little grey matter needed to enjoy the fun, and ridiculously cliche ridden, but a great addition to any true action fans collection. Enjoy

0792844890|3.0|Mel Brooks tackles Lucas in this hillarious parody of 'Star Wars' starring Mel Brooks, John Candy, Rick Moranis, and others.  Another tongue-in-cheek slapstick from the master of slapstick!    The plot is a parody of the 'Star Wars' trilogy except that it involves the Drews instead of the rebellion.  The Drews are happy on their promised planet and don't want to share their precious air with anyone and so have shut their atmosphere to oustsiders.  The Drews' planet is in danger of having its air sucked out of it by Dark Helmet and his minions.  How will they stop them?    This is a bubble-gum comedy that makes humourous references to the Star Wars genre. Hence Yoda is subsituted for the master Yogurt who uses the Schwarz instead of the force, Pizza the Hut instead of Jabba, Mog instead of Chewy, etc.  A fun film to watch for light entertainment and laughs.
B000AP04OM|1.0|When I see garbage like this, I finally understand what is wrong with the world. I watched this movie on a dare and was absolutely mortified!!!!! I would have given it negative stars if I could have. As an animal lover and vegetarian, I was especially offended!!! Anyone who is a fan of this series should run, not walk to the nearest Psychiatrist. You are in desperate need of having your head examined. And we as a society wonder why violence and seriel killers have become a part of daily life. Well, ladies and gentlemen I present to you Exhibit A.......
B000002JSR|3.0|Like others say, listen to the 8 studio albums first.  If you want more, then get Coda.  About as entertaining as much of the work on their last two albums, and more entertaining than the solo material I've heard. <br /> <br />The box set version of Coda includes the single \\"Hey Hey What Can I Do\\", a good idea.  <br />
B0002IU988|4.0|There are a lot of people out here that think Scott Stapp is a good singer.  He, like Eddie Vedder, is MONOTONE!  This new singer actually has a vocal range.  He does remind me a lot of a mix between Geoff Tate and Chris Cornell.  Scott Stapp wrote better lyrics for sure, but he mumbled and had a one octave range.  The music is 10x as complex as anything Creed has done.  There are some similarities to Steel Dragon from Rock Star, but if I was a guitarist who was compared to Zack Wilde, well, I'd be a happy man.  The guitar work is the best I've heard in years, and the solos are just sick.  Scott Stapp must have been holding these guys back, because the music is explosive.  When you have limited vocal ability like a Scott Stapp, the music has to be dull so he isn't outshined.  This album is musically explosive, lyrically weak, but the strong delivery of the vocals more than makes up for the lyrics.  THANK YOU MARK FOR BRINGING BACK GUITAR ROCK!!!  As you may have guessed, I was not a fan of Creed or their limited vocalist, but I love Alter Bridge.  Brings me back to a time when music rocked AND was fun!!!
B000000P17|2.0|Only get this CD if you have the first 4 studio albums and want more, or enjoy the songs/style being covered.  It is sold at a bargain price for good reason.  I often forget about this fifth studio album, but as a GNR fan, am glad that they released everything they could in their short career.  I usually just listen to the first track.
B000286RNY|3.0|I watched the chinese version (with english subtitles) with my wife thinking that this was going to be your basic silly kung fu/soccer movie.  I WAS that but it also had times of senseless violence and humiliation. (didn't see the Americanized version).  The character of the sweet bun girl morphed from shy, unattractive to overdone to bald goalie.  Since I'm not chinese, maybe this stuff is really funny on the main land but it was lost on me.  Some genuinely funny parts and great special effects but keep in mind, it is mixed.
B000002JSN|4.0|The first disc would be a great 5-star single album.  \\"In My Time of Dying\\" is long (11 min), but worth it.  \\"Kashmir\\" is not overrated.  It's really that good (IMO). <br /> <br />Disc#2 contains relative 2nd rate material.  My favorites: Boogie With Stu, Black Country Woman, Down By the Seaside.  I'd rate disc#2 as 3=good.  I am more likely to listen to Presence and In Thru the Out Door than this disc#2.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I expected it to be more graphic than it was, truthfully.  However, having seen other spawn of Hollywood, I was surprised at the fit that everyone else has thrown.    That said, the visual imagery of this movie is nothing short of stunning, and it keeps in tune with the Bible more than I expected.  To those who were perturbed that Jesus' teeth were good:  People of that time did not have the shoddy, sugary diets that we indulge in.  Therefore, their teeth actually stayed in better condition for longer.  A scientist wrote a piece on this following the movie.  I would quote the source, but I'm sure it can be found somewhere on the internet.    Also, it pleased me greatly to see Jesus and Mary having a typical mother-son playful moment during a flashback sequence.  How refreshing!  After all, this WAS his mother.  I'm sure that they did have a nice relationship with each other, which is something one tends to forget when thinking about the Son of God.    I am not saying that viewing The Passion will change your life or your way of thinking.  It may not.  However, it will make you think.  In fact, following the ending, I did not feel a sense of the movie being over so much as I wanted to just go somewhere quiet and think about what I had seen in great depth.  Give yourself the opportunity to enjoy some of the most brilliant cinematography you'll ever come across as well as a film that is guaranteed to make you think.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|Beeing a really freak crazy matrix fan, I think this will be a very \\"collectivable\\" and precious thing to have <br /> <br />Yes, there are no dir comment, but this is the only that matters here?, 25 hours of never seen footage !!!(even if you have M1 , M1revisited, Anmimatrix, the ETM game , Mrev and Mrel) <br /> <br />I love bonus, bhind the scenes, featurettes <br /> <br />The last 3 Discs appear to be very very interesting also, even if there are no backstage deleted scenes whatsoever <br /> <br />I Definitely will buy it.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|i really love this cd and dvd, my favorite songs on it are A Rush of Blood to the Head, Amsterdam, and Everythings Not Lost.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I don't know what else I could say about this incredible film. Many see it as the clumsy part of the trilogy, not very understandable until the whole series is seen. But for what is considered the middle third of the longest Hollywood movie ever made, its certainly a sight to behold.  <br />I still cannot get over the artistry of the computer effects. Not only are they ultra-realistic, they aren't used gratuitously. <br />And after seeing such low-quality CGI like Spiderman and Hulk, it seems all the more amazing. As Peter Travers put it, the battle of Helm's Deep will go down in history as one of the most sophisticated action sequences in cinema.  <br />As far as the DVD goes, the added scenes made this part of the trilogy, a great singular film.  I always thought the characters of Eowyn and Boromir were pretty stale in the theatrical version, but with this edition, Boromir has become one of the more intresting characters in the story. Finally, too much can't be said about the amount of info put into these little discs from the commentaries to the documentaries. Who had any idea that the ARMOR had this much detail.  Deserves any and all awards and acclaim it recieves.
B0001VWP8I|2.0|The third time around Anastacia releases a self-titled album that has a couple of hits but fails as an offering. The only two tracks worthy of release are the ones that have been. \\"Sick & Tired\\" is arguably the powerhouse diva's best song, carefully structured and multi-influenced. \\"Left Outside Alone\\" is another perseverance stand with loud vocals.<br /><br />The rest of this new release relies on producer hand-me-downs and mushy material. The hits, however, are worth the time.
B00005J73X|5.0|Just bought this album & Love it! All the Great songs here & <br />they work best Live. Primo rendetion of a classic oldie <br />(Livin' on a prayer).Another Fave is I'll be Saturday Nite & <br />the Defiant \\"it's my Life\\" - though I'd probably have this <br />2nd from Last on the set List.You give Love a Bad name comes off <br />well & \\"I don't Like Mondays\\" - with sir Bob - is an <br />interesting inclusion.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of the greatest CD's that has every been made. This was the first that I could listen to every song and not get bored. I dont care if he raps about gays and homos, and killing crap it is good music. It has a good beat and it is just good to listen too. I will always like this CD and if u do not have it, i encourage u too go out and buy it.
0465043550|5.0|Mind expanding book. <br /> <br />If you manage money for a living you probably already know that academic finance is plagued with shortcomings. <br />The most skilled money managers in the world earn hundreds of millions dollars a year. If anybody could learn to manage money going to school we wouldn't observe those compensation levels. <br /> <br />Mandelbrot points out correctly that the standard mathematical tools are insufficient to manage financial risks. <br />Consistently outperforming money managers know this and either design patches or use proprietary tools. <br /> <br />Mandelbrot proposes his own mathematical framework as an alternative to mainstream finance. I won't tell how good it is. It is responsability of the reader to check if these tools work. There are supposedly successful hedge funds using this math (e.g. Olsen) but the smart reader will not believe anything until he verifies it through his own research. <br /> <br />While I recommend this book to anyone managing money, I don't believe Mandelbrot's ideas will be widely accepted in academia. In any case being a finance researcher has a curse. In the markets, if someone outperforms the indices someone else has to underperform. Not everybody can outperform. Therefore if your ideas are accepted and everybody uses your stuff then obviously it won't generate outsized returns and you won't be in the billionaire money manager club. Your only hope to see a million dollars in your lifetime will be the Nobel Prize. If you choose instead to make money with your stuff and keep it to yourself, you will be anonymous and lonely but stinking rich. <br /> <br />Therefore the only drawback I see is that Mandelbrot does not ask himself what would happen with his model if everybody adopts it. Can it change the way prices move? Financial advances change the markets and due to the curse I mentioned, they tend to nullify themselves: remember portfolio insurance, convertible pricing models etc. etc. <br /> <br />Mainstream finance (indexing in particular) \\"works\\" because it basically says \\"it's OK to be average, just mimic the indices\\". So its wide acceptance does not nullify itself. <br /> <br />I reach the conclusion that only a select few can take advantage of Mandelbrot's thinking. One thing is for sure: if anybody finds a way to make money with Mandelbrot's stuff he won't tell anyone about it. <br />
B0000TB01Y|2.0|While the score has a few terrific numbers (Popular, Defying Gravity), this one is, at best, uneven.  The opening number is awful.  Others are laughable.  I really enjoyed the book and was terribly disappointed seeing the show.  I have enjoyed much of Stephen Schwartz's earlier work.  I gave this cast recording repeated listens and never warmed to it.  Despite all the praise, Wicked is just not up to par for me.  Some of the lyrics are pedestrian.  There is little character development or plot advancement through song.  The Wizard's songs are awful.  The show never decides what it wants to be about or whose story it should be.  The leads are terrifically talented and deserve a better written show.  IMHO, Avenue Q absolutely deserved the Tony over Wicked.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I am a Christian, but Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Read that sentence again. I wrote that it was MEL GIBSON'S The Passion, not THE GOSPEL'S The Passion. This is a movie, people! And judging this solely as a movie, it is very poor. There is absolutely no story. If you don't know who Christ is, then you have no reason whatsoever to care that he's being tortured. The people who are being moved by this film are the one's who already know the story. This is a very unimaginative exercise that just basically tortures Christ for two hours and calls itself a movie. Even as someone who knows the story, shouldn't Christ stories be about his life and ministry, rather than his death? I do not think that Christ wants us to dwell on his death, or to wallow in buckets of his blood and gore. Give me a break. Do we really need a movie to tell us that getting whipped and nailed to a cross is horrible? <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong. It's not like I sat there and felt nothing. In fact, I felt very angry. Not at the people who were torturing Christ, but at the filmmakers who tortured me.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|During a cold white Christmas in Tokyo three homeless characters, Hana, Gin, and Miyuki, with different pasts, discover an infant thrown away among garbage.  Hana, a transvestite, dreams of having a child of his own and considers the infant a godsend.  However, the drunkard Gin brings to light that someone must have had the child and someone might be missing the infant.  Hana reconsiders her \\"gift\\" and decides that they will try to find the mother and an answer to why the child was thrown away.  Gin and Miyuki, a teenage girl, agree and together the odd trio begins a heartwarming search for the parents of the infant.<br /><br />Tokyo Godfather is both a warm and distressing animated film that brings numerous topics to the table such as gambling, alcoholism, poverty, homosexuality, generosity, family and much more.  These topics create several different subplots that are all intertwined into the main theme of the film, which is brought to the audience with a pragmatic dialogue.  The realistic environment is alleviated through the animation which eases on the suffering of the audience as some scenes would be too distressing if really filmed.  Tokyo Godfathers also switches interjectionally between tragedy and comedy which leaves the audience with a humorous, yet serious cinematic experience.
B00028HBKM|5.0|A little groundwork first, I was born in the early 50's and raised in a strict Roman Catholic household, I am a lapsed Catholic primarily because of Vatican II, like Mr. Gibson.<br /><br />I sat in awe for 2 hours watching this movie. No, watching is not quite the correct word, experiencing this movie, this spectacle. Everything I had been taught in parochial school came back with a vengeance. I had tears from almost the beginning, though the beginning was abit surreal and confusing. This is not a film to watch, it is a film to experience. The trials and eventual crucifixion were completely explored and clearly, though it was not spoken in this film, affixed the blame where it should. I would be surprised if this film did not reap every Oscar available. It was not so much what was spoken, but what you felt and knew already. Somewhere in the back of any Christian's mind this story came to life in ways that normally can only be imagined.Yes there is a violent factor in this film, but in my opinion it is overblown. Those were horrific times, brutal to the point of excess. I know now why the R rating and it is for one scene that cannot be ignored. When Jesus was being whipped and then the monster whip with the hooks hit and ...oh...what an effect. Jesus as a man endured at least what this movie shows and maybe a lot worse, we will never know. This movie is not about any faith or even right from wrong. This movie is not about any religion. This movie is about the suffering of one man who happened to be the son of god. Knowing full well that for mankind to be saved he must die, Jesus as a man suffered intolerable cruelty and ultimately his death. He had a responsibility to his fellow man and did not let us down. Maybe the point of this film is much simpler. Maybe it shows us that no matter how much we suffer or complain about the way things are, there is one man who took the worst the world could offer and in the end triumphed by as he said, 'it is accomplished'. If god can sacfrifice his own son to save mankind, then why cannot we 'suffer' a little and do some good for just one person? I still won't go back to the Catholic church, but I feel good and am not sure why.acfrifice his own son to save mankind, then why cannot we 'suffer' a little and do some good for just one person? I still won't go back to the Catholic church, but I feel good and am not sure why.
B000089RV6|5.0|This album will always be tainted with a slight aura of sadness (and happiness as well) for me: Bon had just died and nobody thought that AC/DC would survive. But we were wrong, Back In Black is arguably their finest recording. Its an album that rocks as hard today as it did back then. The song Back in Black has one of the greatest and most memorable riffs of all time. What made AC/DC great is that these boys played some of the groovingest hard rock ever laid down by the hand of man. Its damn funky and kicks like a drunken skinhead in a bar bust up. All hail the mighty Young brothers and their inestimable collaborators: Brian Johnson, Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams.
B00005JNEI|4.0|In this country, we're supposed to be able to voice our own opinions freely, without fear of reprisal.  But it seems that freedom of speech is a hotly contested controversy, along with liberty and justice for all.  What a country. <br />The movie was very good, but it did not surprise me at all.  I feel that people who keep their eyes open and pay attention, and know how to weed out the media propaganda that we are all exposed to each and every day on television, newspaper and magazine media, etc., would see or have seen for themselves. <br />I decided after Bush was \\"selected\\" that I would never vote again.  Now that his term is up, I have again become an active voter, and hope to conttribute to a change in my country (yes, MY COUNTRY) this election year!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I love it. All the songs  are great!. And this is from a  mid-30s fan. Somehow, I feel transported to 1994, when the Cranberries \\"no Need To Argue\\" was released. the same effect and strenght. It is a *MUST*. I thought that there was no hope, after s&^#$^ music of Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears and Hillary Duff. This album proves me wrong. KEEP HOPE ALIVE!
B00005U2LM|4.0|It's ok that this CD isn't as ground breaking as 36 Chambers.  Most groups early albums are better than their later ones anyway.  But Iron Flag is still a solid effort and very good CD compared to all the crap on the radio now.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is an amazing artist... I first heard him on One Tree Hill and decided to buy 'Chariot'.  The whole CD is phenomenal.  He has a voice that really stands out.  If I thought I loved his music before, I was wrong... I fell even more in love with it when I got to see him live.  He puts on a great show, he's entertaining and the raw emotion that he puts out there will knock you off your feet.  Gotta say that my favorite part of the show was his rendition of 'Let's Get It On'.  For a $13 concert ticket, you won't see anything better.
B0001CNPLI|5.0|Shogun Assassin is a movie spliced together from episodes of a Japanese television show from the seventies called Sword of Vengence (single episodes of which are now available on DVD) that have been dubbed with English and given a voice over narration by Ogami Itto's son.  The television show is based on a comic book series from Japan called Lone Wolf and Cub(these are now available in the states from Dark Horse Comics).  This is a squel to Lightning Swords of Death which has been assembled from the television show the same way.  A lot of people say it was banned in the eighties.  I don't know if that's true, but it has certainly been out of print for the better part of two decades, as can be seen by the price this thing goes for used. <br /> <br />The story is of a samurai, Ogami Itto, employed by an evil shogun to behead the enemies of the shogun.  The shogun becomes worried that Ogami is going to kill him, so he sends assassins to kill Ogami.  Makes sense so far.  They succeed in only killing his wife.  As anyone who has been watching movies for any time will know, if you kill a man's wife, he immediately becomes a psychotic killer out for your blood.  The interesting twist here is that Ogami decides to take his two-year-old son on his path of vengence.  Ogami's son rides around either in a backpack or in a baby cart equipped with all manner of hide out weapons which are all sharper than razors.   <br /> <br />It should be said that, contrary to opinions of Quentin Tarrantino, this is no movie for children.  There is some nudity and blood by the gallons.  Apparently during the time period of shogunate Japan the circulatory system of the human body was under immense pressure.  People get hit with swords and the blood sprays out like it's coming from a garden hose with your thumb over the end.  The sword fight in Kill Bill with the Crazy 88 made me immediately think of this film, only toned down slightly.  There are beheadings and limbs chopped off, one guy even gets turned into nothing more than a stump with a head (sans ears and a portion of his scalp).  People get hit with all manner of edged and blunt instruments.  In other words, if you want to see people sustaining traumatic injuries delivered by the weaponry of medieval Japan, this movie is for you - if you can find it.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|We lost him too soon. But we can thank that unstoppable Ray Charles determination for this last duets project. Ray held it together from July 2003 through March of this year to work with some of his best friends and colleagues as well as some new friends and fans. In his last session in March, the duet with Elton John, \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word,\\" as Charles' health was declining, Concord executive  John Burk reported that people were actually crying in the control room. Burk said, \\"Elton came back in to listen, and he started crying.\\" When you listen to GENIUS LOVES COMPANY, you'll cry too, but mostly from joy. When I put this CD in the player, I instantly felt as happy as I've felt in a long time. Some old friends, some great songs and that unmistakable, rich voice of Ray Charles. James Taylor lends his \\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" and friendly vocals to the party. Diana Krall guests on  a sultry version of \\"You Don't Me.\\" Bonnie Raitt eases on down with Ray on \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind.\\" Bonnie said, \\"Getting to record with Ray has been a lifelong dream and being part of this project has been one of the proudest and most moving moments in my life.\\" Additional guests include long time friends, BB King, Gladys Knight  and Willie Nelson, plus Norah Jones, Natalie Cole, Michael McDonald, Johnny Mathis and Van<br /><br />Morrison. Thanks for giving us one for the road Ray. -Sandy Shore
0380778556|5.0|From the moment I started reading Rebecca I was hooked. The storyline was amazing, the characters were outstanding, and Du Maurier used a great amount of detail to describe the mysterious Manderly. I must have enjoyed this book more than any other I have ever read. I was literally upset the rest of the day after I finished it. I had to read this book for school and it definitly wasn't a waste of time this summer! I recommend this book 100% and I think most people out there will enjoy it. This book combines Romance, Thriller, and Mystery all in one! It was truly amazing and I'm on my way to read other books by Daphne Du Maurier.
B000025XKM|5.0|This is not at all my preferred style of music.  These days I'm into Autechre, Pole, Oval and other eclectic electronica.  Back in the seventies when this stuff was being penned and sung, I was into King Crimson, Led Zep and other much more electric and fraught stuff. <br /> <br />This CD blew me away when I first heard it last year (I also like \\"Way to Blue\\", despite its more produced and less minimalist ambience, which is what really appeals to me on this album).  There is an integrity about these songs that belie their seeming simplicity.  They create a sort of eerie maudlin warmth that really is unlike any other music I have ever heard.   <br /> <br />Couldn't point out any standout tracks, 'cos they're all brilliant.  Worth a listen, even if you aren't into seventies Brit-folk!
0393035158|5.0|A Brilliant Book. It is the logical aftermath of Samuel Huntington's Foreign Affairs article The Clash of Civilizations but brought up to date and far more interresting reading.  <br /> <br />A young man is riding on a bus. He sets off a bomb that he is wearing under his clothing - what religion is he? Another young man takes a sniper rifle and blows away the doctor at an abortion clinic - fundamentalist Christian would you say? Another Arab settlement on the West Bank is bulldozed flat - well you get the idea.  <br /> <br />As Huntington predicted, we are in an era where faith inspires conflict. It's not the first time. In 846 the Muslim's sacked Rome. A couple of hundred years was the first crusade. During WWII the Christian Germans killed six million Jews in the Holocaust. Another five million were Gypsies, blacks, homosexuals, Jehovah Witnesses; but that's another story.  <br /> <br />Harris' basic tenent is that a bunch of books, written by God, but mutually exclusive even to recommending that you kill the believers in all the other books is not a safe way to run a world. He eloquently calls on us to take a secular, humanistic approach to solving the problems of this world. It's an approach almost guaranteed to offend everyone.  <br /> <br />Even if you decide not to read the book, go to the authors web site, [...] and at least read the Q&A.
031286504X|4.0|I had read a few Matheson books before this one. I knew what it was about roughly and thought it would make an enjoyable read. IT DID. I loved this book. It is a little dated with some of the things in the house like the record player and such, but still just a fantastic book. Great story, unique and clever with some great emotions from the lead character. Ive since watched &quot;The Omega Man&quot; which was LOSELY based on this book. I hope they make an I AM LEGEND movie, a great title and a great book.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This was a great film. Period. It was very, very close to scripture and reawakened my feelings as I grew up Catholic. I have Jewish acquaintances who saw it only to seek out negative things that could be used as anti-jewish even though there was nothing of that sort on this film. The Jewish community remarked that it would stir up an old hatred towards Jews. Again, there was not anything like that in the film. If there is any hatred or resentment towards Jews, no one needs this film to conjur up those feelings. If people resent the Jews, it is due to their conduct in these current times, not in ancient times.
B0002S94OS|4.0|There'll be no contention from this here reviewer: Lamb Of God has definately improved. Where have they improved? Uhh, well... They, uhhh... Better production? Okay, that's subjective isn't it... Well then how about the music's technicality? Nah, they've really not changed a thing. If Lamb Of God wants to stick around in both mainstream and underground circles, then this a great way to start. Just be themselves. And honestly, I don't hear much of a change in sound or vision. Recording is cleaner and the song composition leans in a slightly more straight-forward trashing manner. Clarity often strips a band of it's safety. What I mean is: What I didn't notice before is now a glaring annoyance. What in the name of Lamb Of God could I possibly have to complain about on 'Ashes Of The Wake'? The vocals, there's just not enough variety, power and passion in delivery. It's a very monotonous element in the music after repeated listens. Okay, but wait... I love bands like Earth Crisis, Carcass, and even Slayer where the vocals are straight forward and whatnot... But what's the difference between them and Lamb Of God? The emotion you can feel! The ever shifting dynamics of the delivery that keeps songs interesting! I just don't feel the soul of LoG has come out in full on this release. That said, four stars, because it does kick ass, it is METAL and \\"Laid To Rest\\" and \\"Now You Have Something To Die For\\" will fit nicely on any mixed CD. \m/ <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002O37RM|5.0|Longtime collaborators Haden and Rubalcaba have produced a recording of many delicious pleasures. <br /> <br />It's worth a short accounting of how this music came about (as rendered in the disc's liner notes).  Charlie Haden, a man with deep affinities to Latin music, played a concert in 2003 in Austin, Texas.  After the concert he was approached by Patricia Mendes, daughter of Mexican composer Jose Sabre Marroquin, whose song, \\"Nocturnal,\\" Haden had recorded earlier.  She wished to thank the artist for his beautiful rendition of the song, and to give him a folder of her father's compositions.  <br /> <br />After carefully looking over these compositions, Haden showed them to Gonzalo Rubalcaba to see if the latter might be interested in working with him on an entire disc of Marroquin compositions.  When Rubalcaba showed enthusiasm for the project, the two began to plan a recording session, which ended up with eight songs by Marroquin and one each by Mexican composers Agustin Lara and Armando Manzanero. <br /> <br />The result is this disc.  In many ways, it is a recording of profound, although deceptive, simplicity.  The musical materials comprise such commonplace elements as to lull the unwary listener into an almost tropically soporific stupor.  A closer attending reveals subtleties of composition, arrangement, and playing that vault the proceedings out of seemingly merely generic pretty Latin music into the precincts of glorious felicity.  The leader's bass playing has a lot to do with it.  Charlie Haden, for years, has developed and cultivated a unique style on acoustic bass, combining a careful placement of notes, an individual, even idiosyncratic sense of timing, and a depth of sonority and gravitas seldom approached--let alone achieved--by any other player in the history of acoustic jazz bass playing.  Often concentrating on the mid to lower registers of his instrument (in contradistinction to many of his contemporaries, who like to work the upper registers), he is in some ways a kind of throwback to earlier stylists, but his own harmonic and rhythmic sophistication makes him an innovator of the order.  Rubalcaba's playing and arrangements also add mightily to the mix.  What's he's done is penetrate to the melancholy, wistful heart of this music without sinking into sentimentality.   <br /> <br />Add Joe Lovano on tenor sax, the up-and-coming Miguel Zenon on alto sax, Lionel Loueke on guitar (who greatly livened up Nicholas Payton's latest disc), and other players of note, and you've got a crew of master musicians making music that is not only beautiful but consequential. <br /> <br />Wonderfully evocative.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is sheer brilliance. The concept is genius. A boy with a sleepwalking disability cheats death by wandering out of his house in his sleep and avoids a jet engine that lands in his room, and the second he cheats death the culmination of all the actions of his unplanned existence presents itself in the form of a sinister bunny named frank. This is the only logical explanation for the basis of this movie, some people will try to say Frank helps him cheat death by luring him out of the house, but that just doesn't work. Frank didn't exist before  <br />Donnie cheated death, so that's impossible, not to mention there's a reason why the movie opens up w/ Donnie waking up on the Carpathian Ridge. The soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard, and the movie sticks to the time period better than movies actually released in the 80's. This movie is incredibly deep and complex, and acted out by a broad scope of talented actors and actresses. Richard Kelly is a masterful director, and nobody could play the role of Donnie Darko better than Jake Gyllenhaal. Simply amazing. <br />
0156907399|4.0|This is a more demanding read, really a literary event when it came out in the 1920s. It's about a British family on vacation and the family stresses and tension that arise. The narrative moves about with a shifting perspective, making it excellent for book clubs that want to push it. Good for discussion about the structure of thought and time. <br />
6305603847|5.0|Please, oh please, can we stop calling Pink Floyd The Wall an acid trip?  This movie is a masterpiece (my favourite movie, actually) created by a team of five particularly wonderful talents... among others.  First, there is Roger Waters, with his amazing lyrics and introspective musical themes that pull you in and direct your mind through the movie.  Obviously, Roger Waters and Pink Floyd deserve the most credit, but animator Gerald Scarfe and cinematographer Alan Marshall are the ones who created the beautiful, dream-like look of the movie.  Even if you hate Pink Floyd's music or the story of The Wall, you will be transfixed by the swirling, symbolic visions of Pink's dreams and nightmares (mainly nightmares).  Director Alan Parker was wise in making the decision not to add any dialogue (the entire movie is told in Pink Floyd's music with a few short phrases moving certain scenes along).  He also brings out the best in actor Bob Geldof, who plays Pink, the burned-out rockstar.  Although he has very few lines of dialogue, Geldof brings intensity into every moment of his screen time (he also does a wonderful impression of Waters's voice during the fascist rally scene near the end).  To say that this movie is merely a drawn-out music video or a film that can only be watched on drugs is to categorise it with the lowest common denominator in movies.  This is not a film meant for a casual Pink Floyd fan or a person who wants cheap escapism in a film.  It is a thinking film, an art film, that must be watched and listened to with complete attention.
0316776963|4.0|Many will know Sedaris from his hilarious autobiographical commentaries on NPR, especially during his time spent living in Paris. His books are equally funny with such a quiet, sneaky sort of humor and self-referential sarcasm that you can't help but like the guy. From his childhood lisp to being an American in Paris, the anecdotes of his life will literally have you in stitches. One of the funniest people alive. An easy read presented in episodes, good for traveling or the beach. <br />
0380789035|5.0|I've loved the Sandman graphic novels ever since my younger brother introduced them to me, so I was already a fan. Having heard good things about this book for a while, I finally picked it up while buying \\"Hurricane Charley\\" books. I devoured it. The characters are richly drawn and you can empathize with almost every one. To marry midwest America with ancient mythology - what a tantalizing prospect! And he delivers. Plus, an actual plot that keeps you - or at least kept me - guessing until practically the end. Loved it.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I don't care what bad reviews are written about this movie.This movie was good in that it captured the monster movies of yesteryears and brought them into the 21st century in special effects.Violence you say,thats what you need with this type movie.Graphic violence is what this type of movie thrives on.Van Helsing could be much better if they had put more effort in the story(Had room to make it longer)more detail behind the plot.This story will continue. Hopefully Mr Jackman will play the part again.I can't think of anyone who could fill his shoes in this story.It seams the second movie out shines the first these days.I'm sure this will be true for this one too.
B00028HBKM|5.0|It's no accident that \\"The Passion\\" was brought to the world in the year 2004.  Whether you might believe it or not, we are very, very near to the day when Jesus' long-expected Second Coming will occur.  The signs of His coming are everywhere.  And as the world grows ever-darker with violence and evil of every sort, God has used an entertainment medium--the motion picture--to reach a huge number of His children with a staggering reminder of His love, forgiveness and the promise of our eternal destiny. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson was God's perfect choice to make \\"The Passion\\" and to do it right.  When \\"Christian\\" production companies have attempted to tell the story of Christ's suffering and death, the results have come off looking cheap and amateurish.  Hollywood hasn't done much better; its versions have nearly always been overly-pious, sanitized and outrageously cliched.  But as a self-admitted sinner-saved-by-grace, Gibson possessed both the humility to invite divine inspiration and the God-given artistic vision to be able to make the story truly come alive again.  As he stated, \\"The Holy Spirit was running the show--I was just directing traffic.\\" <br /> <br />What makes \\"The Passion\\" so very powerful is its gritty honesty.  For the first time we get a \\"reality check\\" of the heartbreaking consequences of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice--a sorrow made even worse by the fact that, as horrific as the images in this film are, they probably pale by comparison to what Jesus REALLY experienced during that final day of His earthy life.  Much of this film is extremely difficult to watch, and yet it brings us to a profoundly deeper appreciation for the unfathomable love shown by God on our behalf. <br /> <br />The theatrical release of \\"The Passion\\" was seen by many millions of people around the world.  Now that it can be viewed in the privacy of one's home, the film's audience will increase even more dramatically--as is surely God's intention.  In the year 2004, \\"The Passion\\" is one of God's few remaining calls to His wayward children--a call to \\"come home\\" to the shelter of His unending love and the eternal truth of His Living Word.
6304698798|5.0|What can I possibly say about this movie, that hasn't already been said?  <br /> <br />This is quite possibly one of the best westerns ever made, even if it's not entirely accurate. It's a great romp, and the movie sucks you in almost from the first scene. <br /> <br />Typical Leone style, if you've never seen any other of Leone's work. Big, wide views, switching to intense closeups. Dialog never seems to be a real issue in any of Leone's movies, as the images can tell the story. <br /> <br />Morricone's soundtrack is just as big. The famous musical catchphrase has long since turned into a cultural icon, and has been used in just about every possible genre you can imagine. <br /> <br />You need to see this movie. You need to own it. And while you are adding this to your shopping cart, find the CD for the soundtrack.

B000066NW0|2.0|Here it goes: <br />1) Losing Grip is a good song. The lyrics are great and so is the melody. I think Avril had this track put in 1st to show the listeners she was 'punk' but then, lets skip ahead to the other tracks: <br /> <br />2)Complicated.....You can't deny this isnt a good song. The thing that ruined it was that she wanted to seem punk, but this song doesn't do that. It doesnt portray people as punk. I also got sick of hearing that 'Uhu, uhu, Life's like'....well, you know the rest. Sorry Avril, maybe for the next single. <br /> <br />3)Sk8er Boi....The 2nd single off this album. I really don't like this song as much. Its too 'pop'. Try again Avril, maybe next single. <br /> <br />4)I'm With You...the 3rd single off this album. A good chick song. Maybe one that could drive us guys crazy if it was played alot like the last too singles. Thankfully, this single wasnt a huge hit. It gave our ears a rest :-) <br /> <br />5)Mobile....One of the few tracks of this album I like. Very catchy, but, unfortunatley for Avril, not punk. Next. <br /> <br />6)Unwanted...At first I was like \\"Hells yeah!\\"  'cuz I heard that guitar intro. \\"Finally, the Avril I know!\\" Then I went to the booklet to read the lyrics. Humm..maybe she had some 4th grader write these lyrics. \\"I just don't understand why you won't talk to me..it hurts.\\" WOW...very powerful Avril. *thumbs up* <br /> <br />7)Tomorrow...I don't know about you, but I love this song. Of course, its not 'punk' but lets put that aside for a sec. The lyrics are great, the melody is original, and its a song you can fall asleep to. <br /> <br />8)Anything But Ordinary...Its  a song a group of girl-scouts would sing over a campfire holding hands and kissing butterflies and catterpillars. Next. <br /> <br />9)Things I'll Never Say...Again, one of the few songs I like. I watched the trailer for 'Mona Lisa Smile' again last week, and it featured this song's chorus. It got attached to my head. So I kept singing it and singing it 'IfI say what I wanna say, *something something something* away.\\" Then I REALLY heard it and it went like \\"If I say what I wanna say, I say I wanna blow you-\\" I was like, WHAAATT???! Then it continued on with \\"...away\\"  *Whew* :-) <br /> <br />10)My World...how POP is this song?! Its kinda like her \\"PUNK/ROCK\\" autobiography about how HARD and TOUGH her small-town life is. \\"Made my money by cutting grass, got fired by a fried chicken ass.\\" UH OH! Watch out! The new Marylin Manson is born! Neeext. <br /> <br />11)Nobody's Fool...Ok, so I start hearing this song, then- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! AVRIL RAP!!!! HOW PATHETIC CAN SHE GET!!!! HAHAHAHA! THIS IS TOOO MUCH. NEXT!! <br /> <br />12)Too Much To Ask...Don't really like this one. Not so much. <br /> <br />13)Naked...I bet I'm not the only one out there who thought this was gonna be a naughty song! Let me tell ya something: ITS NOT! :-P It starts off pretty O.K. Then you get to the chorus, and its like \\"What?\\" At this point of listening to the album, you get pretty much jaded and don't even know what the hell she's talking about. <br /> <br />Okay, so what was a guide to \\"Let Go\\" by Avril Lapunkvinge. To those of you who bought \\"Under My Skin\\" BEFORE this 1st album and was STUNNED by the creativity and talent of NEW Avril, and buy this one second. Believe me, its a step down. I personally LOVE New Avril, because New Avril rocks. When I say rocks, I mean REALLY rocks. I recommend \\"Under My Skin\\" to those of you who liked \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\" off this album. If you do like old Avril better than New Avril, then I suggest you proceed to reading the \\"In The Zone\\"  reviews right over there. This section is for grown ups only. ;-)
B0001AP12G|5.0|First of all for the fool who said 50 cent is horrible and G-unit is overrated and that Jay-Z is overrated should think about what good rap is...good beats..Nice flow and deep rhymes..Although im not a huge Jay-Z fan hes still not overrated.. <br /> <br />Back to Kanye..he is the only good thing to look for good rap in the Rocafella..The Rocafella is an overated label, and has the worst in rap besides Kanye West. The Diplomats, Memphis Bleek, Freeway, Beenie Siegel or however u spell it should stop rapping for getting embarassed on a freestyle by Eminem. All of these rappers dont come anywhere close to Kanye West..Songs like Jesus Walks, and Get em high are top class songs that other people in the Rocafella cant come near as close. The only one who is nearly as good is Jay-Z, and Kanye has just been introduced into the rap game..
B00028HBKM|2.0|The Passion of the Christ is  a Pointless movie... all it does is depict a lot of unnecassary suffering. If Jesus thought he was alleviating us of a burden then he was wrong, we all have to suffer. The pain he went through is best seen (to me anyways) as symbolic, a physical representation of the spiritual suffering we all must go through in order to arrive at the truth within ourselves... <br /> <br />\\"To truly find God, truth needs to be found independently from the opinions of others. The truth has to be found in our hearts.\\" --A.H.Almaas <br /> <br />If you're trying to find some nugget of truth within this movie... I would say it is that sometimes, as Jesus has done, we must go against the majority, even if it means suffering. Right now the majority happens to be hypocritical bible thumpers. Christianity has become a raging cult, Jesus would be agonizingly disappointed in. I urge anyone who reads this to please, for your own sake, think independently of others. <br /> <br />Oh, and one more thing. Don't bring your children to this movie unless you want them to be traumatized. Just remember, therapy is expensive these days.....
0345350499|5.0|No other Arthurian legend story had me so immersed as the Mists of Avalon. I can't truly provide a review which will do this book justice. All I can say is that this book is one of my favorites of all time.
B00028HBKM|4.0|A touchy subject is a touchy subject. Many conclusions have expectedly been argued from many fronts. It's brutally forthright in its vision. I, without seeing the theater release (I didn't really want to be exposed to other opinions until I had my own), wanted to dismiss POTC as a vehicle for media sensationalism and Hollywood glorification. Mel did a fine job making Braveheart a bloodbath and thought this was an extension of that style. And it still is in many respects, obviously.<br /><br />I read the Bible. I own the DVDs JESUS and THE GOSPEL OF JOHN. They both bring up valid viewpoints and portrayals of the Christ (even if the GOSPEL OF JOHN is quite literally a linear interpretation of the Book of John). Both celebrate the *life* and *message* of Jesus. What POTC does differently is tell that message cinematically through the betrayal and scourging and ultimately His Crucifixation. I especiallly approve with the decision to use languages native of the time. Mel spends some cash on this piece and it's a risk for the casual viewer. But obviously anyone who does his or her homework can follow along without subtitles quite effortlessly. Remember that POTC is *not* meant to be a substitute for the written Word. It is an artistic scrutiny of Jesus's final hours.<br /><br />The DVD's anamorphic 2.40:1 widescreen layout is simply put; breathtaking. The picture quality is on par with the best of 'em. The audio is also put to good use. Listen to the crowds laughing and murmuring during the Christ's trial. The dialog is clear and makes the Aramaic easier to digest. The only thing holding back a 5 star rating is a lack of extras other than setup options and the chapter list. But it was expected and one look at the back of the DVD revealed what was (and wasn't) on there. We obviously know 20th Century Fox is gonna put out an extremely thorough version in the (hopefully) near future.<br /><br />Summarily, it's simply and awesome movie once you get past all the surface hyperbole. I tried to hate it before seeing it. But once you get inside Mel's head, you will begin to maybe understand it is only one man's secular version of the Greatest Story Ever Told, or at least a part of it.o hate it before seeing it. But once you get inside Mel's head, you will begin to maybe understand it is only one man's secular version of the Greatest Story Ever Told, or at least a part of it.
0141301155|5.0|A confection as sweet as any of the candy Willy Wonka ever might have wanted to create, in this novel Dahl, who wrote many inventive and magical stories, created his masterpiece. <br /> <br />A classic that every child should read.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Speaking on behalf of the \\"old\\" generation...someone who saw the original SW trilogy when it was first released in theaters, I can honestly say it is not \\"whining\\" to want to the original versions to be included on this DVD box set.   <br /> <br />I grew up with these movies, and they're still among my favorites.  I am interested in seeing an \\"updated\\" version that incorporates the prequels...but I still want the movies that I've enjoyed for years.  I'm sorry Lucas didn't like the special effects back in 1977..clearly most of us didn't have a problem with it, judging how popular the films still are today.   <br /> <br />I've been looking forward to these DVDs for a long time, but now, less than 3 weeks before the release, I'm finding that I'm not that excited about it.  Star Wars isn't *really* coming out on DVD, at least not the way I remember it.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I wrote a review about Slipknot's self-titled album and back then I thought they were one of the best up-and-coming bands around.  They fell off a bit with the second album, in my opinion, but I thought they'd be able to get together and put up a solid third CD.  I've officially lost all hope.  If you liked the style of the first ablum, don't buy this.  If you like a mix between Stone Sour and horrific, poorly contructed mainstream-y metal, than maybe _MAYBE_ you'd want to pick this up.  I'd strongly suggest listening before you buy, however.
0156027321|4.0|Unlike Robert Katrin, I liked the first of the book.  More importantly, unlike Robert Katrin I read the whole thing before I made a judgment.  What sort of pinhead decides whether a book is good or not without even reading it?  The stuff about Pi's time on the sea, trying to survive is interesting and fresh.  The twist at the end raises all sorts of interesting questions.  This book may not be for everyone, but it is original.

B000001E7T|4.0|a soulful, powerful work that rivets the nervous system before inducing calm and relaxation...and then it's back to thunderous, pulsating, gyrating cacophonies of sound and fury.<br /><br />Really awesome stuff, indeed.
0393035158|5.0|Harris not only has the guts to tell us the truth, he backs it up with a plethora of facts.  This compelling book provides an in depth understanding of the role religion has played in bringing mankind to the brink of a future wrought with terror or no future at all.  This book will open your eyes (if you are willing to listen to reason) to the increasing dangers of religious fundamentalism.  Few books can provide you with the insight and understanding of the dynamics of this most serious of struggles.
B000000H42|4.0|If your looking for a cd to start off with Mercyful Fate than this is the one. Kinger's falsetto throws you off at first but once you've heard it a few times then you get used to it and enjoy it. The opening track is excellent \\"A Dangerous Meeting\\" as well as \\"Desecration of Souls\\". If anyone likes old metal like Testament or Maiden try this out.
B00024BHTC|5.0|This album is by far Nightwish's greatest achievement. <br />The last albums were decent but \\"Once\\" blows them out of the water. The vocals sound so much better and in tune. Another element that makes this album great is due to the instrumentals. The orchestra component is outstanding! It blends in so well with the power hitting melodies by the band. The band has set a new threshold in excellence with this baby. I don't know how in the world they would be able topple it in years to come. This is a masterpiece. <br /> <br />The first five songs are smashing. <br />One of the most memorable songs is Ghost Love Score. It takes real talet to produce a song like this. Just amazing stuff.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Having seen this concert live, I couldn't resist buying the DVD to enjoy again and again.  The Band (and Orchestra) are at their best.  This is a MUST HAVE for any Yes fan!  You WILL NOT regret this purchase!
0385335482|4.0|I have to say I enjoyed this book, I really did. As one reader previously noted, I also found myself not believing how one can become so financially irresponsible, a little bit yes, it happens to all of us, but Becky Bloomwood irresponsible? Whoa! <br /> <br />It makes for a rather slow, unamusing start but it definitely picks up. I slowly found myself laughing at how she views her purchases and, I hate to admit it, enjoying her descriptions of them. The book unfolds very quickly because the narrative rings so true, it's almost like a conversation. The book finished on a high note, I was feeling good (makes sense since I laughed so much throughout it) and I'm actually looking forward qute anxiously for the sequel. <br /> <br />This is definitely not a deep read but it is a very enjoyable one. Sophie Kinsella's ample descriptions in this book made me wallow in a world of some luxe which it turns out I wasn't the only one not able to afford it...neither could Becky! But it was fun :)
0060989157|5.0|Like them or not,and I happen to really enjoy them but that wouldn't change my opinion of this book ! It is totally amazing,insightful and very-very entertaining.Even if you hate MOTLEY CRUE or hate rock music this book would really be a joy to read.And if you are a MOTLEY fan-it is totally amazing.From all the fighs,girls,drugs,money trouble,etc.But when it's all over you realize that these four men that changed music and American youth forever are really honest,thoughtful human beings.And I almost forgot-NIKKI SIXX ROCKS!!!!!
B000002KFJ|4.0|At this point in their history, Black Sabbath really were \\"sabotaged.\\"  Indeed, some photos of Ozzy Osbourne from this time period show him wearing a \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" tee shirt and it is rumoured that \\"Am I Going Insane\\" was to be the title of his solo project, which may have featured ex-Deep Purple (and future Sabbath) bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes and Irish guitar wiz Gary Moore.  They were deep in legal wrangling (detailed in \\"The Writ\\") and going ever deeper into substance abuse. <br /> <br />The previous album, \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" was bold experimentation or self-indulgent noodling, depending on whom you talk to.  Sabbath needed to come back with a strong, powerful album. <br /> <br />Did they do it?  Mostly.  \\"Sabotage\\" had some razor-sharp heavy metal tracks but unfortunately too often succumbed to the self-indulgence of \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\".  There is some real fire here, and Ozzy sounds angrier than he has anywhere else.  Of course, the playing of Tony Iommi (also producer), Geezer Butler and Bill Ward is excellent. <br /> <br />\\"Hole In The Sky\\" - This is THE killer track off the album!  Pure, cutting, heavy Sabbath, as it should be. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Start (Too Late)\\" - It's said that Tony Iommi was experimenting with some flamenco guitar and saw that the recording light was on and told the engineer \\"Don't Start!\\"...but it was too late.  Kind of a good interlude though. <br /> <br />\\"Symptom Of The Universe\\" - Probably the album's best-known track.  Various incarnations of Sabbath have continued to perform it (I heard Tony Martin do an excellent job of it in 1994) and it appeared on Ozzy's Sabbath-ripoff live album \\"Speak Of The Devil.\\"  Mostly good, strong and heavy, though it gets bogged down at the end with keyboards (Gerald \\"Jezz\\" Woodroffe is quite noticeable throughout the album) and acoustic guitar. <br /> <br />\\"Megalomania\\" - If there were one track that summed up Ozzy's \\"madman\\" appeal, this would be it.  This is a truly disturbing song, especially in headphones.  I would call it the progenitor of \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" (the song). <br /> <br />\\"The Thrill Of It All\\" - Another heavy one, kind of boogie-flavoured, but not the band at its best. <br /> <br />\\"Supertzar\\" - Not really a \\"band\\" track.  This is Tony Iommi playing along with a men's choir with Bill Ward adding bells and assorted percussion.  This is where experimentation did pay off.  This track was used as the band's intro tape on the 1983-84 \\"Born Again\\" tour with Ian Gillan. <br /> <br />\\"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\\" - As the title infers, a stab at a hit single and quite ridiculous with all the synths.  Ozzy cannot sing \\"pop\\" music at all.  Every time I hear this, I think \\"Abba\\" rather than \\"Sabbath\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Writ\\" - A mostly-venomous diatribe against the legal troubles the band were having at the time.  When it's heavy, it's quite good but also succumbs to aimlessness.  However, Tony, Geezer and Bill rescue it and the end with some good, heavy playing. <br /> <br />\\"Blow On The Jug\\" - Depending on what pressing of the album you have, this may or may not be on it, and if it is, you'll have to turn up LOUD to hear it.  This is an old English pub drinking song with Bill Ward playing piano.  Hilarious. <br /> <br />This was the last upturn the band would have during the Ozzy years.  The next two albums, \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" and \\"Never Say Die!\\" would show Tony Iommi taking full control of the band and Ozzy coming and going, and the music would suffer accordingly.
B000002B7M|5.0|I aboslutely adore this CD. I have played it so many times that I have all the lyrics memorized. Forget all the reviews that say that this CD is no good, they are lying.  <br /> <br />Some of my very favorites on this CD are \\"Crazy Train\\" (his best song ever) \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" (written as a tribute to Black Sasbbath) and \\"Suicide Solution\\" simply because i like the way it sounds. <br /> <br />If anyone ever asked me whether or not they should get this CD, even if they have never heard Ozzy before, I would definitely say yes. Buy it and you certaintly won't regret it!
B00006879E|1.0|I find it odd that no one thinks this sham of a group sounds oddly like a really really crappy version of Jamiroquai. I wish I could start a band and rip off the idea from a previously popular group and have my swill played on the radio/movies/tv for the next year. Hmmm. . .sounds like Maroon 5.  Hmmm sounds like Godsmack (taking their name/sound/ideas from Alice in Chains) go Check out the originals and then tell me that Maroon 5 isn't a cheap knock off.
B000005DQR|5.0|I kept hearing this album mentioned during my long travels through the worlds of hip hop and turntablism, but for a few years I was too stubborn to listen to it.  I finally did and I see what all the fuss is about.  It's like hearing Charlie Parker after swearing by the likes of Sonny Rollins and Coltrane, who owe so much to him although they went on to do a lot more.  What I mean by that is I think there are people out now (RJD2, Kid Koala, DJ Logic, Jazzanova, Madlib) who are doing a lot more with the genre of instrumental hip hop or whatever you call it.  But they have mostly gone into their own thing without too many followers; a lot of people like that seem to be in some way indebted to DJ Shadow's work. <br /> <br />Endtroducing is a very introspective and composition-minded collage of obscure music.  You emerge from its often purposeful but confusing melange of sound feeling very...clean.  This album is the type of high work of art that doesn't seem to have too much of an agenda.  Sure there are the traces of the true but tired anti-pop sentiment (see track 10), but it mostly comes off as just trying to be good, and ends up being great.  (As I'm writing this I'm listening to the last song, which is really beautiful and the perfect way to end an album).  The mix of genres sounds completely natural and unforced, conveying a cultural completeness that eliminates immediate urge many people have to slap a genre name on something. <br /> <br />'96 doesn't seem like that long ago, and in my mind hip hop didn't really start dying until '98, but the anti-pop rap thing has come a long way since then, often steeped in furious self righteousness.  Even great groups like Lootpack waste entire records complaining about wack mcs.  Then there are pieces of art, art without pretension, that jump off the page and are heard without having to talk too loud.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb of God's previous album &quot;As The Palaces Burn&quot; is one of my favorite metal albums in recent memory. My anticipation for &quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot; was very high and I braced myself to be a little disappointed thinking it might not live up to the greatness of the last album. After popping the CD in I was immediately impressed. The production of this album is by far the best of any of the bands other albums. It's just so tight from beginning to end. The title track and the opening track &quot;Laid to Rest&quot; are the highlights for me in what is overall an excellent metal record.<br />Lamb of God has done it again. If you liked their previous work you will probably love this. 5 stars!
B00006G8G1|5.0|Grandiose is probably the word to be used for this concert. The stage is big, the crowd is wild and of course the newly reunited Maiden are in top form. The intro is taken from movie First Knight, nice epic classical intro, then Smith take everybody by surprise with the intro riffs to Wickerman! other tracks from the then-released Brave New World include The Ghost of the Navigator, Brave New World, Blood Brother, The Mercenary and the already classic Dream of Mirrors. This song has an intro that shows Bruce in excellent shape. Of course there are the classic closers Fear of the Dark, Iron Maiden, Sanctuary, Number of the Beast, Hallowed Be Thy Name and Run the Hills. There are also hits from the 80's The Evil that Men Do, The Trooper, 2 Minutes to Midnight and Wrathchild. No track from Somewhere in Time, although it's the album that sounds closest to their current sound, and also nothing from No Prayer For the Dying. Fans of Iron Maiden know that they are not ashamed to play songs from the Blaze-era, which I think shine as much as the ones from the golden era: the epic numbers The Clansman and The Sign of the Cross. If you are a fan, you probably already own this on DVD and double audio CD, if you are trying to get into Maiden then this is a good point to do so. The packaging, the bonus interviews, the picture quality and the sound mix are quality. Really great DVD!
B00005JNEI|5.0|As a 9/11 survivor and cousin of a U.S. soldier, I was very hesitant to watch this documentary.  I already harbor anger over what I witnessed and survived on that day, but the true horror has come only from the hands of those who had authority handed to them on the backs of disinfranchised Floridian voters. Together with others who on that day walked for miles, getting comfort from others along the way, I seethed as I watched President Bush in this documentary, listening to a story in a school for a photo opportunity at the very moment I watched people die on Trinity Street.<br /><br />Michael Moore, currently reporting on the RNC, I thank you for making this documentary.  Thank you also for being witness to the exploitation and prostitution of that horrific day currently taking place by this administration at this event.  I look forward to your next project.
0792844890|1.0|They were heavy as I tried to sit through this short (but endless-seeming) movie. As one of the few critics to diss this, I will keep it brief. Several of my friends-not just one-recommended I see this, so they brought it to our group get-together. In a word, the film was cheesy. I know it's a parody and I've seen some great parodies, but couldn't the quality have been better? Not only the film quality was aggravating, but the characters. The princess, Yogurt, and Pizza the Hut were probably the hardest to sit there and watch. Long before the credits rolled, I was out in that chair. I'm still confused as to all the positive hype about this film.
B0001XAS2G|5.0|To a certain extent, it's not that surprising that certain fans will somewhat write this album off, being as it was, along with \\"Year Of The Cat\\", Al's commercial peak--in the US, the album reached the Top Ten on the album charts and went platinum within a year of its original release in September/ October of 1978.  Granted, Al did some respectable music earlier on in his career, and he's done some great stuff since, but \\"Time Passages\\" demonstrates a master craftsman at an absolute peak.  I'm sure Al himself would roll his eyes at this statement, but I think Alan Parsons, who produced this album, probably deserves the lion's share of the credit for keeping Al away from two of his key pitfalls: thin production, and a general cutesiness.  And Al truly rises to the occasion here--his songwriting on track after track is so melodically rich and full of outstanding, incisive lyrics, it leaves no doubt as to what he can really do.  Also, his understated, precisely-phrased, clearly enunciated vocals complement the material perfectly.  Guitarist Peter White, a longtime cohort/ collaborator of Stewart's, co-wrote the beautiful, timeless title track, as well as the album-closing \\"End of the Day\\".  Everything in between was written by Al himself.  Some fans seem to find the sound of the album too bland/ soft-rockish/ radio-friendly, which is being very harsh.  His folkier side is very much represented on \\"Timeless Skies\\" and \\"Almost Lucy\\".  Maybe it WAS radio-friendly for its time, but listening today it sounds arguably even more impressive than when first released in the sense that there's little-to-none of the overdone, overly slick, lifeless production that's heard all too frequently on much 1990s/ 2000s music.  The album is so rich and complete, you could go on at length discussing the individual tracks.  The thing that really drives it all home making the album additionally special is the emotional resonance of the material.  The majestic title track, \\"Timeless Skies\\" (with a great \\"rainy\\" acoustic guitar part), and the relaxed \\"Song On The Radio\\" are all wistful, breezy, and wonderful.  The haunting \\"Almost Lucy\\" is one of his patented 'mysterious woman' songs, terrific and affecting.  \\"The Palace of Versailles\\" with its great synthesizer melody, and the punchy uptempo quasi-rocker \\"Valentina Way\\" are a couple more gems from the album.  Al said in an interview over 20 years ago that he doesn't expect listeners to fully understand his often historically-based lyrics, and that some of it elludes even himself.  Having attended a Stewart concert this past June, playing solo with acoustic guitar, his humbleness is readily apparent, and as much as he clearly enjoys piling in the little details into his lyrics for the fans who love trying to decipher it all and to point out any historical inaccuracies, he is truly effective in his attempts to communicate feeling.  This Rhino Records treatment of the album, with the liner notes and outstanding sound quality, take an already excellent album that extra mile.  If you're new to Al, this is an ideal starting place--\\"Time Passages\\" deserves a place in any serious listener's collection.
B00005JNEI|1.0|First and foremost, I have seen this film after closely reading what many a film critic have said.  The critics were right.  Moore twists the reality of this little place I call earth, and warps it to play his version of life.  Newsflash:  Iraq was not a nice little suburb filled with kites as Moore claims.  Saddam gassed, poisoned, beat, and terrorized those who opposed him, and he also had many a person shot in the streets for defying him.   <br />     Now, Tambo claims to be a Vietnam Vet.  Well, I am a veteran too, but I am a veteran of Iraq's war.  May I ask you something Tambo?  How would you feel about Michael Moore if he took video and photos of you while you were having your arm amputated, so that he could slap it into his \\"mockumentary\\" and make a cool 100 million off of your misery?  And may I ask you how you would feel if he did all of this without your permission, so that when you ask him to apologize for doing so, he refuses?  Michael Moore is a real American hero?  Yeah, and I am Spiderman.  Hopefully the agony and blood of US military personnel will make Michael Moore another 100 million so that he can feed his fat face some more cheeseburgers while he portrays himself under the facade of a common man.
B000053VAZ|5.0|\\"Benny & Joon\\" ranks high on my list of favorite movies. The storyline is fairly unpretentious: Juniper \\"Joon\\" Pearl (Mary Stuart Masterson) is a slightly unbalanced young woman living with her overprotective brother Benny (Aidan Quinn). The two have been on their own since their parents were killed in a car accident years before. Joon requires constant supervision, as she has a tendency to light things on fire, but her sometimes volatile moods drive away one housekeeper after another. Juggling his life between work and looking after his sister, Benny has little time of his own. At last he must face a difficult choice - should he continue trying to find a housekeeper who can deal with Joon's eccentricities, or should he consider placing her in a group home, where perhaps others will do a better job of caring for her than he can?<br /><br />Unable to find someone to look after Joon one night, Benny allows her to accompany him to his weekly poker game. And when Joon loses a hand, Benny suddenly finds himself saddled with an unexpected and not altogether welcome houseguest - Sam (Johnny Depp), the strange cousin one of Benny's friends can't wait to get rid of. Little do they realize how drastically this odd newcomer will affect their lives. Sam's quirky ways, particularly his unconventional method of making grilled cheese sandwiches, intrigue Joon as nothing ever has before. And having Sam around to look after Joon frees Benny up to pursue a romantic interest of his own with Ruthie (Julianne Moore), the pretty waitress at the corner restaurant. But as Joon's bond with Sam grows stronger, Benny finds himself torn at the idea that he may no longer be the central figure in his little sister's life.<br /><br />It's a fun, cute, slightly off-beat romantic comedy, but it isn't all fluff. Unlike many others in the genre, this movie has some substance underneath. The emotions of the characters are genuine, and the brother / sister relationship between Benny and Joon is stressed just as much as the romantic one between Joon and Sam. Though the film contains quite an assortment of oddball characters, it manages to remain rooted in reality and stresses the important things in life. For all the funny, up-beat scenes, like Sam's hilarious physical comedy routines in the park, there are also some serious sequences. The scene on the bus where Sam gets his first real dose of the gravity of Joon's mental illness is probably the heaviest in the film.<br /><br />We are never told exactly what is wrong with Joon. Seeing the movie for the first time, after hearing the terms \\"unbalanced\\" and \\"mentally ill\\" used to describe her, I had expected her illness to be more serious and overpowering than it actually appears to be. She's eccentric and moody, to be sure, but for most of the movie she seems to be quite sensible and sane, sometimes even more so than the other characters. However, she does sometimes hear voices, as we see in the aforementioned bus scene. My personal guess would be that Joon is mildly schizophrenic, and perhaps also somewhat manic depressive, to explain the volatile mood swings. But the important thing is that she does not see herself as \\"odd\\" or sick. It is the rest of the world, and Benny in particular, that must realize that perhaps Joon is capable of living a more normal, independent life than she has been allowed to so far.<br /><br />The entire film is very well acted. I cannot think of a single cast member whose performance was not up to par. The stars of the show, of course, are Mary Stuart Masterson as Joon and the incomparable Johnny Depp as Sam. Masterson captures the nuances of Joon's character to perfection. One has no difficulty in believing her complex character to be genuine. And despite her oddities, she remains loveable throughout. Sam is just the kind of quirky character fans of Depp would expect him to play, and he carries it off beautifully as usual, here drawing heavily on the influences of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. His character is slightly more difficult to envision as an actual flesh-and-blood person than Joon's, but in the context of the movie it works. Aidan Quinn and Julianne Moore also turn in great performances, and smaller parts are contributed by Oliver Platt, C.C.H. Pounder, Dan Hedaya, Joe Grifasi, William H. Macy, and Liane Alexandra Curtis.<br /><br />This is a film I imagine almost anyone could enjoy. It doesn't adhere rigidly to the typical romantic comedy formula, it's believable despite the occasionally far-fetched elements in its plot, and it is genuinely funny and moving by turns. It's also suitable for viewers of just about any age. Again unlike so many modern romantic movies, it does not depend on sex scenes to establish romance. In fact, the physical aspect of Sam and Joon's relationship is limited to just one fairly tame kiss. There's nothing here that parents need be concerned about having their little ones watch. The movie isn't overly long, either, clocking in at only 98 minutes.<br /><br />The DVD special features are not overly impressive, though there is some worthwhile material. There are two deleted scenes. One is a sequence where Benny, impresed by Sam's physical comedy abilities, has arranged an audition for him with an agent. Unfortunately, there is no option to turn off the director commentary which is placed over the scene, so one can't actually hear the dialogue, which I would have liked. The other sequence is simply a full-size version of the horror movie scene that Benny, Joon, Sam, and Ruthie watch one night. Other special features include an audio commentary, a long series of costume and make-up tests, a stunt reel, the theatrical trailer, and a music video for the theme song \\"I'm Gonna Be\\" (a.k.a. \\"500 Miles\\") by The Proclaimers. In summary, this is a terrific, fun, feel-good movie with a decent DVD. Definitely worth adding to your collection.lightly more difficult to envision as an actual flesh-and-blood person than Joon's, but in the context of the movie it works.

B000003TAL|5.0|Daydream Nation is regarded as one of the most groundbreaking and influential indie records of the 80's. When you listen to this album, it's easy to hear why. All through the album you can hear a large number of sound layers consisting of guitars with alternate tunings and lots of feedback. This may sound as if Daydream Nation is just some sort of experimental record that you problably won't like. In fact, Daydream Nation is not an experimental record at all. Through every song you can hear a very clear pattern and the alternate tunings and sometimes heavy feedback just add something extra to all of the songs. This is what makes Sonic Youth such a unique band and this is what made them so influential to so many other bands such as Nirvana. Just listen to Daydream Nation first and then listen once more to any of the early Nirvana records and you'll hear what i mean.  <br /> <br />P.s. I saw them live last monday at the Paradiso in Amsterdam and it's just amazing to see how skillfull they are when it comes to handling their instruments. Thurston Moore is simply one of the most genius guitar players around.  Anyway, check out Daydream Nation, you won't be dissapointed.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|It is very rare that I  purchase a CD and not regret the purchase as soon as I hear the first song on the album.  Gavin DeGraw's, Chariot, cd is very impressive, almost too impressive for a debut album.  It is so refreshing to know that the lyrics that the artist is belting out are actually his own.  All of the songs were written, composed on the piano, and sung by Gavin DeGraw, something that is almost unheard of in today's music industry.  Gavin DeGraw's lyrics are relatable to everyone, which helps bridge the gap between the artist and the listener. On the Chariot album you listen to a variety of issues, from accepting who you are as a person, such as \\"I Don't Want To Be,\\" to finding  true love as in \\"More Than Anyone.\\" As a teenage, I can relate a lot to the song entitled \\"Chemical Party.\\"   In this song he sings about attending parties where everyone he meets is drunk or high; so much so that they make stupid decisions because they are too obliterated to understand what they are actually doing.  Although my decision tends to change daily, \\"Chariot,\\" has to be my favorite song on the album.  In this song you can see that he is a genuine musical genius, which he makes visible through his phenomenal piano skills and sensational vocals.  He is truly a scale above the rest of the music industry and it is evident in just this one song. <br /> <br />Gavin DeGraw deserves so much more credit than he is receiving at this time.  He is slowing climbing up in popularity which is a major relief.  His hit single \\"I Don't Want To Be\\" has received much of its popularity due to the fact that it is the theme song for the television show \\"One Tree Hill.\\"  As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter how he gains acknowledgment, as long as he gets the attention that this CD definitely deserves.  To reinsure the fact that he is such an step above the rest, listen to his live album called Chariot Stripped.  I am a witness first hand at how breathe-taking he is in concert.  Gavin DeGraw is a true musician, which is evident in everything he creates. I look forward to hearing more from Gavin DeGraw, after all it is only his first album. <br />
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This is ultimately a fairly objectionable movie. It offers vacuousness poorly disguised as profundity, and stereotype poorly disguised as cultural commentary. The characters may be realistic in their emptiness, but I doubt this was the filmmakers' ultimate intention. The title itself seems to try to offer an excuse for the film's vacuousness (an excuse that seemed to pay off in terms of popular and critical praise).<br /><br />The film is not exactly boring, since it does keep you waiting for some insight or emotional pull, which is unfortunately never forthcoming. Scarlett Johansson is cute as hell, though, and the acting generally is quite OK.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Really, who cares what anybody thinks Muse sounds like, the issue is Muse's record and no one else's. And as to the record, it is definitely a good album. As many of the the reviews stated before, there are heavier parts, and there are slower and more haunting moments to the record. \\"Time is Running Out\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" take you through blood racing moments of rocking goodness. While \\"Sing for Absolution\\" and \\"Blackout\\" will be the tunes you can't stop singing while you try to sleep. Every track has a heavy hook and is annoyingly catchy. Muse is good for those who enjoy fabulous melody, interesting chord structure, and contemorary Brittish rock and roll.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|So, this film is about a guy who finds out that he can change his past by re-thinking it. He kind of falls asleep, changes some event and when he wakes up he has to cope with the consequences. As the title of the movie says, these consequences are not exactly calculable. I would not call it an scifi, its more kind of a moralic lecture. Dont wish- it might become true (die geister, die ich rief). <br /> <br />Whatever happens in this movie happens in extreme. It seems that the producers were afraid you wouldnt get the message that a small thing can make big differences. It is just too much drama. Less would have been more (that scar in her face was a complete surplus). <br /> <br />I found this movie amazing because it was not what I expected. And for some weird reasons I like the end. It was the only good way out of all this. I like the way things fall in place and make sense during the progress of the plot. The actors are mainly average. They had a hard task. And I dont like movies with children in main characters. <br /> <br />But as some of the other reviews say, dont watch this movie if you have suicidal tendencies.
B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is an atypical romantic drama, as suggested from its unusual title. From the beginning to the end it leads the audience to a journey mixed with joys and sorrows resulted from one failed romance. After watching the movie, its philosophical connotation makes me ruminate over and over.    The movie starts with a somberly subtle suspense when Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) met supposedly for the first time. They were attracted to each other at once and spent the following day together, yet the delight of finding the right person is blurred by an unknown scent of sadness, which voluntarily produces a mysterious circumstance to continue the storytelling.    Another part of the story begins as Joel decided to cleanse Clementine thoroughly from his mind after he discovered that she had taken such a drastic measure in an attempt to turn over a new leaf. However, when the operation was being carried out, Joel re-experienced every moment he and Clementine had spent together. Although some were sweet and some were painful, Joel found that the memories were too precious to let go. With his headstrong reluctance, he made efforts to resist to the overwhelming procedure of the operation. His struggles were out of question futile, yet there were quite a few things he could have done or could have undone to mend the doomed relationship. Therefore, Joel reviewed his intense love for Clementine with a more thoughtful attitude in the fictitious occasions created in his brain before they disappeared.    Perhaps it is an axiom that people will not learn to treasure things until they are lost. However, we always end up treading in the wrong footsteps again and again. The subplots in the film serve as another evident proof. Everyone, black and blue from the wounds their troubles cause, is victim to this unchangeable cycle.    The memory may no longer exist; nevertheless, fate or some divine power still gather the same people in one cluster. When Joel and Clementine reunite in the end, will they go through their same old problems and suffer another painful breakup thereafter? On the other hand, is true love everlasting so that even though the two lovers are strangers, destiny or fate will eventually unite them? The movie can be interpreted in two aspects, both are thought-provoking.    Love can be both bliss and anguish, yet it is not to be denied. Its presence everywhere weaves human life into an inexplicable mystery, in which we feel and breathe.    Highly recommended. 5/5
0393035158|5.0|As someone who has watched a parent suffer and die of Parkinsons Disease and as a diabetic myself, I was most moved as I read Mr. Harris' section on stem cell research.  At last, someone who can clearly articulate the big picture, who can illustrate the insanity of holding scripture not as the historical documents that they are but but as the word of god.  As we watch the world torn apart by religious strife, Mr Harris asks us to ask the right questions of ourselves.  As impressed as I was with Mr.Harris' writing, I was equally impressed with his impeccable scholarship as evidenced in his copius end notes and extensive bibliography.  At last an articulate voice trying to stop the madness of true believers.
B00003CXCT|4.0|In the famous words of William Shatner, even though referring to another science fiction genere, GET A LIFE!  The story, the stars, the movie itself is for all intensive purposes is intact.   If you're upset because the frame rate is different than the original film, some cgi has been added, and the grain of the film isn't the same as the original, then you have too much free time.  Enjoy the movie for what it is, A MOVIE.   <br /> <br />Additionally, please don't assume to know what this DVD is going to be like or what's going to be on it since noone in the general public has seen it!  That goes especially for you Star Wars purists who have to complain about any change to the movie.   Take a deep breath, watch the DVD version, then render judgement.   <br /> <br />I'm giving it 4 stars because it should have the benefit of the doubt given the quality of the movies, which should only be improved upon with the assention into the DVD realm.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I own this one and highly recommend it to anyone.
B000002L9Y|5.0|In my book, Fleetwood Mac`s best. Might be one of their most commercial ones, but it was loaded with big hits, and it was the album that grabbed me. My first, My favorite, and even after going thru about all of their other albums, Tango in the Night represents the cream of Fleetwood Mac. Many people swear to Rumours, My heart lies with Tango in the Night.  <br /> <br />Some of Fleetwood Mac`s biggest hits ever are on this Album. \\"Little Lies\\" is a classic. Chances are, if you ever play it to someone who have never heard of Fleetwood Mac, they will melt totally and tell you how they have heard this song so many times before. Then we got \\"Seven Wonders\\", \\"Everywhere\\" and \\"Big Love\\", really big hits, and good, recognizable songs. \\"Seven Wonders\\" and \\"Everywhere\\" are one of my other favorite songs.  <br /> <br />\\"Caroline\\", \\"Tango in the Night\\", \\"Family Man\\", \\"Welcome to the Room - Sara\\", \\"Isnt it Midnight\\" and \\"When I see you again\\" are all superb songs, while though my personal favorites are \\"When I see you again\\" and \\"Welcome to the Room - Sara\\", it is so incredibly rare for an album to have so many songs that you can just enjoy on a album. In fact, there are only 2 of 12 songs here I really dont like, \\"Mystified\\" and \\"You and I part II\\", but they are easily skipped and by the time you have reached any of them, you long for all the other good songs. Its one of those albums where the bad songs are part of making the good even better, and making the overall quality of the album superb.  <br /> <br />This album have a very special place with me. No words can describe how much I love this album, and its star songs: \\"Little Lies\\", \\"Everywhere\\" \\"When I see you again\\" and the haunting \\"Seven Wonders\\". <br /> <br />I`d dance forever in the night to this album.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is the only rapper that I know of whos songs don't revolve around pimps, guns, money, or how tough he and his crew are. I truly respect him for that. Instead, he talks about love, death, God, and trust. This is shown on songs like \\"Jesus Walks\\", \\"Never Let Me Down\\", \\"Thru The Wire\\", and \\"Family Business\\". My one complaint is, that whilst the skits are funny, they are tiresome and repetative. The songs are ten times better. I have tried unsuccesfully to come up with a top five favourite songs list, it's so hard!<br /><br />But my favourites are: We Don't Care, All Falls Down, Jesus Walks (BEST TRACK), Thru The Wire, School Spirit, Slow Jamz, Family Business, Get 'Em High, and Space Ship. I know I've named most of the tracks, but they're all amazing. Kanye West is now in my top 3 favourite artists category, with Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill. HELP \\"JESUS WALKS\\" GET TO NUMBER 1 - YOU LET ME DOWN WITH \\"ALL FALLS DOWN\\" AND \\"THRU THE WIRE!\\". If you like \\"Slow Jamz\\" and \\"All Falls Down\\", get \\"Sunshine\\" by Twista F/ Anthony Hamilton - it's great. Go out and buy this album - DON'T buy \\"D12 World\\" or \\"Straight Outta Ca$hville\\" or \\"True Story\\".<br /><br />-Tom Peter-James Evans-
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Their last really great album was Tango in the Night, which was imo one of their very best albums ever. While Say you Will is not near that masterpiece, it is a nice comeback album. It does maintain that classic Fleetwood Mac Feeling, but it does feel a bit more like seperate efforts by Nicks and Buckingham, and personally I`m belonging to the Nicks base, and in this case, I found myself rooting more for Nicks songs, making the album a little bit black and white. Thats not saying Buckingham`s songs are bad, not at all. While \\"Whats the World coming too\\" is a bit too cliched in its musical build, \\"Murrow turning over in his grave\\" is interesting enough. The Typical voice of Nicks is instantly recognized in Illume, but it seems more like a pre \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" song than a Fleetwood Mac, and thats what I think is the problem with this album. The songs are all nice, but none feel really Fleetwood Mac with influences by Nicks and Buckingham, but the other way around, they feel like seperate songs by Nicks and Buckingham, with elements of Fleetwood Mac.   Nicks does have the upper hand though, as more of her songs and mood feels like Fleetwood Mac, something that is really evident in \\"Thrown Down\\", a superb song, and it could easily have been on the \\"Tango in the Night\\" album.  In a possible attempt to capture that old good feeling from Tango in the Night, Buckingham serves the song \\"Miranda\\" which has an opening about identical to \\"Big Love\\", except that \\"Miranda\\" comes off as a really boring song, and once you are aware of the similarities, it only becomes worse compared to the classic. However, on the next song, \\"Red Rover\\", Buckingham does it better, and I like the song even though it sounds a bit strange to put it that way. Original at least, I`ll give him that.     \\"Say you will\\" is the next song, penned by Nicks. Classic Nicks, less classic Fleetwood Mac, still a good song, with a nice chorus(How can you expect less from her). \\"Peacekeeper\\", the next song byBuckingham, is also good, but unlike Nicks, he doesnt manage to get the choruses right, and they end up feeling a little bit cliched(With that I mean, all the chords comes where you suspect, there are no real hooks or uniqueness to it). \\"Come\\" starts interesting. It is a bit haunting, with its almost ripple-like sound(You gotta hear it to understand), but it takes off with a strange and messy middlepart that ruins the song before going back to the strange and hypnotic mood. Still, Thumbs up.   \\"Smile at you\\" by Nicks is way too much typical Nicks and way too little Fleetwood Mac, and its not very good Nicks either unfortunately.    However...The next song: \\"Running Through the Garden\\" is the star of the Show. Might not be Fleetwood Mac stuff, but its Nicks at the top of her game, doing what she does best. Creating biting and sharp lyrics, wrapped with a superb and catchy melody, with Nicks lovely voice on top of it all. If this cd was the only way I could have gotten this song, and even if it had nothing more on it, I`d still pay double up just to get it. No wonder why we love Nicks.    Stepping down a few notches is done with \\"Silver Girl\\" by Nicks. A relaxed hybrid between Nicks and Fleetwood Mac, its a nice song, while not special. \\"Steal your Heart Away\\" is a decent song by Buckingham, but honestly, I think he is a bit too sweet in this song, but he makes up for it with \\"Bleed to Love Her\\", a nice song. Going back to Nicks, with \\"Everybody Finds out\\" and \\"Destiny Rules\\". The first one is not really good, and could have been left out for all I cared, and the same goes for the second, where she uses the worse style of her vocals, and the song is just not any good.     For the two last songs, there can be no doubt. Buckingham`s \\"Say Goodbye\\" and Nicks \\"Goodbye Baby\\" in an all last attempt to win the hearts. Nicks crushes Buckingham so hard that its almost painful. While \\"Goodbye Baby\\" is not as beautiful as her \\"When I see her Again\\", its still one of the very best songs on this album. I swear, if Nicks wrote a stripped down album consisting of songs like this, it would be one of the most beautiful albums ever, something Goodbye Baby prooves.     To sum it all up, I recommend this album. As long as you dont expect the good old Fleetwood Mac sound, and that you can accept the two quite different styles scattered around on this album, you will most likely enjoy this album. There are songs here that can be heard over and over, and songs that just is skipped, and after a few rounds you should have been able to pinpoint a 5-8 songs you want to listen to over and over, while the rest is just okay. Still, Fleetwood Mac is Fleetwood Mac, no matter how much Buckingham or Nicks individualize it, and it IS a good album.
B000002KBA|5.0|Deep Purple with the released of the best hard rock album of all time \\"IN ROCK\\" had inspired many younger heavy prog-metalbands such as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, UFO, Van Halen & Def Leppard in the 80's. <br /> <br />along with Led Zeppelin & Black Sabbath Deep Purple showed their sharp teeth for over 34 years since the band's debut in 1968. <br /> <br />Long Live Deep Purple
B00003CXZ4|5.0|When was the last time a movie blew your mind? I love it when that happens!  This one did it for me and rocketed straight to my all-time favorites list!     Don't watch this movie while you're talking on the phone, helping with homework, or playing  footsie with your significant other.  This movie will require (and deserves!) your attention!  Pay attention to the tiny details; trust me, it adds up in the end.  The story is told \\"backwards\\".  A series of events replays again and again.  Each time, events that took place earlier and earlier in the sequence are revealed, forcing a radical change in how you interpret what's happening.  And I do mean radical change each time! For me, this took the amnesiac/homicide/whodunit formula into new territory.  It has been a long time since I had no idea where a movie was going.  I enjoyed the experience. Soooooooo smoothly done.    I recommend that you watch carefully and with patience; kind of the same approach I had for \\"12 Monkeys\\".  Don't try to force it to make sense right away.  If you wait for the story to tell itself, I don't think that it will disappoint.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|I am not sure why I saw this movie, its not usually the kind of movie I like. I probably just was in a bad mood and wanted to see loads of pale people in dark clothes, blood, full moon and rainy streets. So far, so good. It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off)  but it lacks from the absence of a \\"hero(ine)\\" or whatever central character to identify with. It would make a good pc-game without much alteration.
B000099T2L|4.0|This is Beyonce's first atempt at Flying Solo. I think her wings have kept her aloft...she's like an angel. She's got style and she's got grace, I'd elect her miss United States! Beyonce does a really good job on this Cd, if you don't have it, i would recommend for you to buy it. My personal favorites on this Album of hers are: <br />(2) Naughty Girl, (3) Baby Boy, and (6) Me, Myself, and I. Ofcourse there are many more that i enjoy, but those are that main ones. <br /> <br />I hope my review has been helpful to you!
0385512104|4.0|I was browing the bookshelves, killing time before I had to be to class, when I came across this book.  I read the first three chapters before I saw that I had to head out, but I wanted to keep going, so I bought it. <br /> <br />The book starts out very well, but the end isn't as good at the beginning.  It's still a good ending, but it just kind of drags a bit.
B00005Q66T|5.0|I Think That The BEST Music Producer in The whole wide WORLD has produced one of the BEST CDs in the whole wide WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />I give MADONNNA props up, 5/5 stars for this magnificent abulm that she has produced. I have always loved MADONNA and this album proves her love to me (us) because it is such a great album. This album contains all of MADONNA's music from the 90's and on. If you don't have this exact album, I suggest that you get it quick, either new or used (at least you will have it) I will listen to this album for ages!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002GTWYW|5.0|I loved this album.  I will always believe 2Pac is the G.O.A.T. but Biggie is a close second.  He tells hood tales, obviously inspired by the film \\"New Jack City\\" and \\"King of New York\\".  Biggie mentions events, quotes, and characters from that film on a few tracks.  After the intro, we are blessed with \\"Things Done Changed\\".  As Murda Inc. does a lot, this song was remade by Ja Rule on his album, \\"Blood In My Eye\\".  But this song is great, talking about how life has changed.  Next comes one of my favorites, \\"Gimme the Loot\\".  Biggie uses two voices for this song, the laid back professional voice and the gun-crazy high voice.  Though it is disturbing, the song is entertaining sometimes.  After an average song(in my opinion) \\"Machine Gun Funk\\", we have \\"Warning\\".  Basically, Biggie finds out that some guys are planning on robbing his house and he raps about how he'll stop them and then finally does.  Afterwards is the title track, which is another average song in my opinion.  \\"The What\\" comes next, which lyrically is great, but the beat isn't nothing special.  Method Man and Biggie trade verses together interestingly.  Next comes the classic Hip-Hop song \\"Juicy\\".  Biggie shows a softer side on this song, telling about him growing up in a one room shack and talking about his dreams as a child.  It is simply great.  \\"Everyday Struggles\\" follows, and is almost as great as \\"Juicy\\".  Biggie lives out \\"New Jack City\\" basically.  \\"Big Poppa\\" is another classic and a catchy song.  That's all the standouts until \\"Suicidal Thoughts\\" comes on.  This is by far one of the most creative album endings of all time.  The intro is Biggie's birth and the ending is him killing himself.  It's like a story.  Plus, we get two bonus songs which are also tight. <br /> <br />Basically, if you're a fan of Hip-Hop cop this if you don't have it yet.
0380789019|1.0|A good friend of mine talks a lot about the contrast effect, essentially how our expectations affect our perceptions. I think that, when it comes to this book, I'm a victim of the contrast effect.<br /><br />I had seen a production of Gaiman's work (his episode of Babylon 5) that I thought was very good. I had had Neverwhere described to me, and it sounded like adult drama, so I bought the book and settled in for a good read, something on the order of (I was hoping) Clive Barker.<br /><br />What I got was more like a cross between The Wizard of OZ and a D&D game. There's an endless succession of quests (which, on the whole, are pretty pointless as far as the reader is concerned), and a bunch of characters who seem pretty juvenile and one-sided, and who do not grow or change much during the course of the story (although the ending is meant to lead us to believe that the lead character has chosen a life of adventure rather than a boring office job). Where I had been hoping for some lyrical metaphors, I got the weakest descriptions possible.<br /><br />Does this make it bad? Hard to say. Based on my expectations, I was severely disappointed, but someone looking for a young adult novel might think it was great.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Why would anyone complain about the original Star Wars coming out on DVD? I've been waiting for this ever since I was disappointed in learning that the Special Edition travesties were the only Star Wars in existence on DVD. I and others should be looking forward to the clean picture and Dolby Digital experience of our favourite trilogy in it's ORIGINAL form. Thank God I'm free from the fuzzy tyranny of VHS with Star Wars coming to DVD!

0385512104|4.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\\" by Mark Haddon, is a diverting novel about an autistic fifteen-year-old boy who understands the physical laws that govern the planet far better than he does those that guide the human heart.  Chris himself is a fully realized character, a fan of Sherlock Holmes, whose worldview makes perfect sense as interpreted for us in Haddon's first-person narrative.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the adult characters that surround him, most of whom appear to be suffering from Tourette's Syndrome.  I find it hard to believe that Chris' own father would regularly use such foul language in front of a child, but perhaps that's where the frustration of dealing with such a child leads him.  None of the adults is very sensitive to Chris's needs, with the possible exception of a counselor from school, Siobhan, who is referred to but little seen.  His mother, for example, is a complete cipher, especially when she is found to be living with a bounder.  Luckily for us, it's Chris who takes center stage in the novel, and his adventures are always fascinating, whether hiding out on a baggage \\"shelf\\" on a train to London or punching out a constable who presumes to lay hands on him.  He even manages to solve some complex mathematical equations along the way and to earn an A level in maths.  All in all, a flawed but rewarding read.
0393324818|4.0|Michael Lewis has certainly written a very engaging book which shows how the rules of the game have changed ever since Bill James' Baseball Abstracts became common currency in the front offices, but no one really took James' in-depth analyses to heart until Billy Beane came along, who used them to evaluate the talent pool in the minor leagues and colleges.<br /><br />Lewis spends the first half of the book explaining this approach, which stresses on base and slugging percentages, and devalues traditional stats like HR's, RBI's and steals.  This was a bitter pill for scouts who gauged players on their stature, rather the numbers.  The result being that they went after buff high school ball players, rather than stallwart college players.<br /><br />Beane had been one of those high school players who never panned out in the big leagues.  The bread and butter players tend to come from the college ranks, and Lewis demonstrates how Beane was able to see past traditional stereotypes and field players on the A's who first and foremost got on base.<br /><br />Lewis fills his story with a fun array of anecdotes and observations which gives the reader a vibrant image of the A's front office and the chagrin of scouts, managers, and players alike in having to play Beane Ball.  This turned out to be a boon to the economic savvy new A's owners who were determined to keep costs down and efficiency up.  Beane also knew how to play the trading deadline better than anyone, which allowed the A's to make amazing second half finishes.<br /><br />All this discounted the prevailing notion that one had to have big bucks to field a great baseball team.  The A's consistently won 90 games, defying the odds with a payroll a fraction of the cost of the Yankees, and nearly beat the Yankees in the playoffs.  But, one is also disheartened at how baseball is reduced to numbers, with players being swapped around the big leagues like trading cards, so that baseball owners meet their bottom line.ne.
B00028HBKM|5.0|One would think that Mel Gibson is crazy, or even weird to have even wanted to make a movie like this. However, one has to admire this about him, he's got guts. Also, one would have to wonder whether the violence in this film was a bit overkill. Gibson has gotten quite a bit of criticism for the violence seen here, but let's be fair. What about Saving Private Ryan, the Kill Bill movies, Bad Boys II? What about them? Schindler's List also shows us violence and horrors in a realistic and horrifying way, and yet that movie hasn't gotten anywhere near the criticism as The Passion of the Christ. I don't think it's fair that The Passion is the target of so much criticism while others aren't.    I must warn you, this is not for the weak of heart. The violence in this film is something not to be taken lightly. You're going to see things which you can't even believe. I recommend against letting any of your kids see it if they're really young. If you think they're old enough (maybe 17 and older), then I say at least consider it.    Speaking of Schindler's List, I consider it and The Passion of the Christ, in a sense, in the same ballpark. Here's why. They're both true stories. They both tell of human suffering. They both tell of a man who has an impact on the world. They both occur during periods of turmoil. They are both told in a realistic, horrifying, violent way. Of course, while the violence in Schindler's List is rather brutal, everything I've seen suggests that the violence in Gibson's work makes that pale in comparison.    I suggest that when you finally do see this film, you see it with an open mind. Don't let anyone tell you what your opinion is about this work of Mel Gibson. Once you see it, make up your own mind.
0393317552|4.0|This book addresses a basic, yet very complicated question. Today, nations of Europe (or European descent, ie the U.S.) dominate the world. They have the most economic, military and political power. Why?  <br /> <br />For example, Europeans ended up completely conquering the Americas. Why did that happen, instead of Native Americans conquering Europe? The obvious answer is this book's title. The Europeans had better weapons, better technology, better national organization, and were vectors for more lethal diseases (most notably smallpox). But why did those conquering advantages develop in Europe rather than the Americas (or Africa or Australia)? <br /> <br />Diamond's answer boils down to geography. In short, the Eurasian landmass had advantages that the other continents lacked. More domesticatable plants (leading to more success in the agricultural revolution). More domesticatable animals (assisting with farming, labor, war - and the aforementioned germs). An east-west axis, with less severe geographic barriers (ie Africa being cut off by the sahara) allowing agriculture and technology to spread. <br /> <br />He explores these factors, and others, in detail. He cites evidence to support his case: biological, archaeological, linguistic. He also takes us on a brief history of human history over the last 13,000 years, and convincingly attacks racist views that whites took over because other people are stupider. (Noting, for example, that people in all parts of the world domesticated pretty much every plant possible - even modern technology hasn't improved on our old record in that area. If you were unlucky enough to live where there were few such domesticatable flora... you had a problem.) <br /> <br />On the downside, while Diamond makes his argument convincing, he perhaps tried too hard to do so, and ends up repeating his points a bit. The topic is, of course, a vast, incredibly complicated one, and he speaks in general terms on some points, often simplifying a certain subject  (but to his credit, admits when he is doing so).  <br /> <br />There is a lot of interesting history to be learned here, and it is well argued and well written. If the topic interests you, this book will will clearly whet your apetite to learn more.
0440539811|3.0|This book seems to generate two sets of extremes.  Either people loved it and found it to be a life-altering experience, or they found it to be a rambling mess and didn't get it.  I side with the third minority who fall somewhere in between. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that the Roberts (Anton Wilson and Shea) are brilliant individuals.  Quite a lot of research went on into creating the this book and the authors definitely did their homework.  Their creative switching of tenses, timelines and perspectives is also wildly original and will challenge the reader.   <br /> <br />As several reviewers have noted, there are a multitude of plot-threads and the authors do an amazing job keeping them all straight.  I sometimes wonder about the WAY this book was written. Did the Roberts write a straight narrative and scramble it up? Or did they actually write it straight through? Remember, this was before word processors. <br /> <br />Indeed, the authors did what they did to get the readers to \\"think outside the box\\". And it works, mostly. <br /> <br />However, it does tend to drone on. There are some long and large passages that ramble on without any seeming significance. I'm sure this a result of the \\"stream of consiousness\\" style of writing from the 70's. But it gets tedious...sort of like watching the last 20 minutes of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" It's a definite product of the Woodstock generation, where \\"Freedom of expression\\" sometimes meant \\"lack of self-editing\\" and it shows. <br /> <br />The subject matter is interesting and makes you think. And if you approach it with an understanding of when it was written and the culture that produced it, it's a good read. <br /> <br />But don't expect this book to alter your reality anytime soon.
B000009EAD|5.0|Something Wicked This Way Comes(1998). Iced Earth's Fifth Album.<br /><br />In 1998, bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn were the most popular bands in Modern Rock, so, music was in the dumps. Although, if you look past the commercial aspect of music and dig deeper, such as in 90's Power Metal(which remains popular in Europe), you can find some of the strongest music ever put to record. Examples of this are Iced Earth, Blind Guardian, Nightwish, Stratovarius, Nevermore, Yngwie Malmsteen, and The Scorpions. Iced Earth, while being unknown to the general public, remains a constant force in heavy metal and thrash, getting huge support from their fans and critics, changing and evolving their sound with each consecutive album. With their previous two records, 'Dark Saga' and 'Burnt Offerings', Iced Earth experimented with Death Metal and Black Metal, which either bothered or enhanced fans' opinions of the band. Whatever your distinction, Iced Earth came back in 1998 with 'Something Wicked This Way Comes', a burgeoning mix of ballads and headbanging rockers, ranging from Power Metal to out-right Thrash. So, was I happy or saddened with the results? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Burning Times- Upon first listen, \\"Burning Times\\" immediately came out of my speakers with the ferocity of Metallica's \\"For Whom The Bells Toll\\", and the song even had the same bell noises! Jon Schaffer's headbanging riff and Barlow's deep growl and falsetto scream work wonders here, and how can you not bang your head after his shrieks of \\"You'd be a SINNER?\\". Priceless.<br /><br />Melancholy(Holy Martyr)- Although I'd be the first to get pissed off at a band for including a ballad on their album, Iced Earth is quite the opposite: Bring on the power ballads! Schaffer's enchanting rhythm guitar and Barlow's brooding vocals build up an excellent ballad along the lines of The Scorpions, but when the song gets heavier during the chorus, you'll be amazed. A very \\"from-the-heart\\" ballad!<br /><br />Disciples of the Lie- If you think \\"Burning Times\\" was heavy, watch out! \\"Disciples of the Lie\\" is a heavy-as-hell, remorseless Thrash song that combines the raw power of Testament and Anthrax and mixed with the pure speed and heaviness of Metallica. Hell, this may be the heaviest song I've ever heard!<br /><br />Watching Over Me- Another ballad, \\"Watching Over Me\\" might just be my favorite on the entire album, blending a tear-jerking mix of Schaffer's melodic acoustic and electric guitar work, but Barlow really shines here, letting out some of the most heart-felt, stirring vocals I've ever heard, especially on the chorus. This song is incomparable to any other band's, see for yourself!<br /><br />Stand Alone- A melodic thrash song, Iced Earth punishes the listener with incredible loudness and speed, blending an incredible mix of remorseless riffs, angry vocals, magnificent guitar solos, and an incredible backup choir. Imagine Dream Theater with Venom: You might understand the speed, power, loudness, and talent this song contains.<br /><br />Consequences- After hearing \\"Burning Times\\", it's hard to imagine Iced Earth doing a song like \\"Consequences\\", an outright ballad about the consequences of greed and power. Schaffer sports a beautiful rhythm guitar melody, while Barlow belts out vocals Justin Timberlake and Usher wish they had. Tarkinson's guitar solos are incredible, and this song really evolves into a heavier song, such as Metallica's \\"One\\", that makes for a great listen.<br /><br />My Own Savior- An angry protest at religion and the world, \\"My Own Savior\\" blends an earful of music, sporting a sound not unlike Motorhead on steroids. Barlow and Schaffer hit those notes perfectly, and the chorus is completely mind-numbing.<br /><br />Reaping Stone- \\"Reaping Stone\\" begins kind of eerily, with Barlow's vocals muttering behind a spooky beat, but Schaffer's doomy electric attack on the senses soon erupts out of nowhere, and Barlow picks up to shouts of \\"Come Into My World Now Child!\\". Reminds me of a darker version of \\"Enter Sandman\\", and the *incredible* musicianship on this track astounds me.<br /><br />1776- Imagine a song about America's independence, and the sense of power, beauty, and the patriotic message it should convey. Schaffer astounds me.. he manages to blend a song that sounds so strikingly similar to what you'd expect from 1776, with guitar melodies that sound eerily similar to the flutes played during battle and drumming that sounds exactly like the little \\"drummer boy\\".<br /><br />Blessed Are You- Although \\"Blessed Are You\\" has a great chorus, not much else happens. See, this is why I don't like ballads! Easily the album's worst track.<br /><br />Something Wicked Trilogy:<br /><br />Prophecy- Undoubtedly, the \\"Something Wicked Trilogy\\" is the album's highlight, and<br /><br />\\"Prophecy\\" starts it off, using Schaffer's foreboding lyrics to mold a creepy and foreboding song. Pulsating from heavy to melodic, \\"Prophecy\\" rushes out with a heavy metal attack on the senses to a Rhythm Guitar melody, and you can't wait to see where the song's going next.<br /><br />Birth of the Wicked- A much darker song, the sense of foreboding and doom-to-come is gone, replaced with a maniacal triumph that describes the coming of the \\"wicked\\" one. Uncomparable to any other band, Iced Earth manages to make the second part seem even better than the first(with their incredible musicianship), but that's until you hear...<br /><br />The Coming Curse- The final part of the \\"Something Wicked Trilogy\\", \\"The Coming Curse\\" begins with a soothing, but slightly eerie piano playing. After a minute and a half, Schaffer's punishingly heavy electric guitar riff and Barlow's insane vocals(his depth is amazing) come out to the listener like a rushing train. An amazing song made moreso by the musicianship and songwriting, the \\"Something Wicked Trilogy\\" couldn't have ended better.<br /><br />Overall, 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' is a great Power Metal/Thrash album, sporting equal ballads and metallic rockers, and never failing to disappoint in the musicians department. Barlow..is..incredible! Schaffer and Tarkinson belt out some incredible guitar work, and the \\"Something Wicked Trilogy\\" is something to behold. More accessible than their other albums(not to mention one of their best), 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' is perfect for \\"newbies\\".<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDBarlow picks up to shouts of \\"Come Into My World Now Child!\\".

B00011D1RC|5.0|Some films in recent years are made with grand scope, thick plots, charming characters. I would say about 15%. The others just pass the time.<br /><br />Grand Hotel, like, say \\"Dances With Wolves\\" has that scope. Grand Hotel, like \\"Chinatown,\\" has that thick plot. Grand Hotel, like \\"L.A. Confidential,\\" has those charming characters. It's a rare experience to see something done by people who care about making a good product. That's the 15%. The others make \\"Gigli.\\"<br /><br />This ensemble piece as all kinds of different stories going on, weaved together at the end with a common frame. The Barrymores are standouts as two unlikely friends: one a Baron/cat burlar who's down on his luck and the other, an older fellow with  terminal health who is spending his last dime in the pursuit of fun before he dies. Wallace Beery plays an arrogant, self-centered tycoon who will burn anyone to keep his business afloat. Joan Crawford is his secretary. She's a nice girl who feels that she must occasionally sacrifice her dignity to survive. Rounding out the stellar cast is Greta Garbo, a famous dancer with serious self-esteem issues.<br /><br />You really can't get much better than this for the 1930's. And it seems to be over before you know it.
0440178002|5.0|First off, I am not a critic and never can be.  I am a scientist, not a literary critic.  I could never write such a wonderful novel as this, so I have no place criticizing it or the author.  I am just giving my thoughts and how I felt and what I learned from the novel.  There might be some spoilers if you have not read it and you read this, but I just recently read it, and also watched the mini-series on DVD.  I was so happy I bought the DVD because I watch scenes from it allot, just like you might listen to a music CD of your choice. I don't think you can find it in a rental store though, so if you love the book, you will probably have to buy the DVD if you care to so. The movie is different from the book, and well you may or may not like the way things turn out.  I didn't, but well Yoko Shimada was perhaps the most beautiful actress you may see in the movies, at least she was to me. She won a best actress award for her portrayl of Mariko, the Lady Toda.   So it was worth it to me so I can just watch and dream about her. :)   <br /> <br />I don't think you can fully appreciate the book in just one reading.  Clavell is just so fluid in his writing that you get lost in his story and you don't think about some things as you read it the first time.  Now critics probably will because that is what they do, criticize. But I read novels, when I have the time, for enjoyment, and this novel was very pleasing to me to read.  You will find that there are several themes that run throughout the book.  A love story, a tradgedy, and a triumph, really a rags to riches story, but one that ends so sorrowfully.  Amidst all this is subterfuge, treachery, usery, duty and honor (bushido), beauty and a love that can only exist on a spiritual plane.  Mariko and Blackthorne became soul mates if you will.  Should we all be so fortunate to have such love?  <br /> <br />It was truly just a great chess game though, if you know how to play chess: Toranago, being the white king, who so adroitlymanipulated all of his pieces and thus became Shogun.  Mariko the Queen, Blackthorne the two rooks, he was that powerful I think.  Alvito and Del'Aqua the bishops and Yabu and Omi the knights, because they were so treacherous and oblique.  You will understand I think what I mean when you read the book.  You won't get that from the movie though. Compared to the book, the movie is very shallow in its development of the characters, and in fact the themes.  <br /> <br />I will talk a little now about the plots and characters.  First off, I had to do some research on Feudal Japan's history and economy to truly understand the story,  You will never understand just how important and powerful and rich Blackthorne became in Japan unless you do.  The man became legendary within I think 6 months of time, more powerful than just about any Samurai out there and his sexual prowess was renouned. At first he was sentenced to death, lived in a pit, urintate on, and subsequently sent to a death prison.  Then through Karma ( I will state it that way) he became a Hatamoto, Samurai and Chief Admiral of Toranaga's fleet with a small fief at first, but in the end, one that would make him a Lord of considerable note.  He would become lord of Anjiro, Yokese and Itu, almost an entire province.  I am somewhat of a historian of Medevial times, and I know just how precious that can be for that period of time.  So at first he may be likened to a Baron, perhaps a Viscount in England, but in the end perhaps more like a Marquess. His annual income would be 4000 koku per year for just Anjiro, but my guess is it would have been raised to close to 10,000 koku per year for the addition of the other two cities, if the story had progressed. I would say he was like a Duke (I think Toranaga thought of him as a brother), but he had no hereditary title so that would be forbidden, so Marquess is perhaps the best title.  And the swords given to him, one would not realize I think on first reading just how precious they were, and how valuable, just as they would be in Medieval Europe.  The swords given to Blackthorne by Toranaga were over 200 years old, and worth maybe 50,000 koku, maybe even 100,000 koku. They were named Oil Seller (you will have to read the book to know why).  He was extraordinarily rich with just his first stipend from Toranaga of 240 koku per year. Towards the end where he was given the Minawara sword by Yabu, who was given the sword by Toranaga, and that sword was claimed to be priceless to a any samarui, he became like a Bill Gates, if not in money at least legend.  So in effect, Blackthorne became everything he wanted to be in England, but instead it happened in Japan which he came to love.  In so doing though, he lost the two most precious things in his life; therefore the tradgedy of the story.  <br /> <br />Unless you think about it, you won't realize why Mariko decided to give herself physically to Blackthorne after Yokese. There are many reasons, but most importantly, he was samurai.  She knew by then she would be dead after Osaka but also that she loved him beyond measure.  She wanted to experience the love and happiness she had never known in life before she died, so she put both her's and Bleackthornes life on the line so that she might experience the greatest joy she had ever known, \\"more joy than I can expect in 20 lifetimes\\"! Even the fear of disgrace and that of her son if found out did not deter her from her need to be with Blackthorne. This of course was a crime punishible by immediate death by her husband, for both of them, Thus the extreme concern for Blackthorne's life.  I love the dialogue in the book during the romantic scenes so I have tabbed them. Many of you might also. <br /> <br />In the book he was given Kiku as consort and she would soon become his wife.  It was the best compensation that Toranaga could give to Blackthorne for the loss of Mariko.  He knew exactly what the two meant to each other and the incredible indescretion that they had purpertrated. He did not care because I think he loved them so much, at least needed them more than any others of his thousands of vassals. So this was Toranaga's gift to both Kiku and Blackthorne and in reality, Mariko. Kiku was worth 3000 koku, an incredible amount of money, one that most can't fathom unless they read up on the economy of the time.  Blackthorne actually did love her in a physical way, and perhaps in a more emotional way too he found her so pleasing, but certainly not on the spiritual plane of Mariko. The movie was not that way though, which I found disturbing because they took so many passages from the book verbatim which was nice, but then displaced them in place and time, and really changed the plot in sections.  Why would they change the ending???  You will read in the book where at first Kiku was absolutely revolted when told she was to be consort to Blackthorne \\"The Barbarian\\".  When told she would become his wife with a stipend of 1000 koku per year (which would make her personally rich beyond her wildest dreams) after the first born son who obviously would be samurai, and also that she herself would be made samurai by default, she was mollified. \\"after all samurai is samurai and two swords are two swords and his sons will be samurai. He's hatamoto, one of my most important vassals, Admiral of all my ships, a close personal advisor -even a friend, Neh?\\" She would be wife to one of the most powerful samurai's in the land and one of the most legendary.  She in effect would become legend just like Mariko.  She was overcome with glee and became ecstactic because she knew that with Omi she would be nothing more than a non-samurai consort of low status if that.  What would you expect from a peasant girl, sold and raised to live her life in the Willow World?  The greatest thing that could ever happen to her, that she constantly dreamed of, was that she would become Samurai, and how could the impossibile become reality?  But it did; a true miracle, or Karma, who knows?   <br /> <br />I am absolutely positive that if you are a romantic who takes pleasure in such stories, you will love this book.   <br /> <br />
B00009W0WM|5.0|There is nothing wrong with this film. It's near-perfect. Almost flawless. The acting is first rate. Bogart and his usual suspects - Lorre, Greenstreet, Raines - all grouped together for one of the most eloquent, powerful, stunning and important movies ever made. and while making it, the studio never looked at it as a big deal. Script pages were literally handed in to the actors on a daily basis. Bogart made less than Mickey Rooney that year. All kinds of strayed fabrics of fate conspired to make this film a bad one, and failed miserably.<br /><br />Bogart plays Rick, a hard-drinking bar and restaurant owner in Casablanca. A very important revolutionary is trying to escape the clutches of the Nazi regime and seeks the help of the person who possesses some very rare letters of transport that will get him on his way: Rick. Problem is, the revolutionary brings along his wife - Rick's old flame played by Ingrid Bergman. Will heartache and spite keep Rick from doing the right thing? You know the ending. \\"We'll always have Paris.\\"<br /><br />By the way, the phrase \\"Play It Again Sam\\" is never uttered in this film. Not once.
B000089CJI|5.0|The Postal Service's album \\"Give Up\\" is one of the most refreshing sounds I've heard in a while. It seems to be the perfect blend of \\"emo\\" and synthesized electronic drums somewhat like Ace of Base or any \\"new wave\\" band. The lyrics are at times reflective of extremely personal situations, or solemn daydreams. If you're looking for some music to pep you up or get you through a hard time, this is the perfect cd. However, you have to be in the right kind of mood and even then it takes some getting used to. I heard about this band from the \\"Garden State\\" soundtrack.

B0002Z0EYA|5.0|This is just my opinion of the movie that I saw in theatres over the summer, I have not seen the DVD and don't know what special features it will include.<br /><br />That being said, those of you looking for a faithful adaptation of Homer will be sorely disappointed.  This is a modern movie loosely based on Homers work.  If you take it as that and go into the movie with an open mind, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  I saw it with my wife (who I think wanted to see it just for Brad Pitt) and I must admit, it was better than I thought it was going to be, especially after I witnessed movie critics coast to coast bashing the film.  It is an epic period piece, along the lines of Gladiator and Braveheart, and I truly believe this film ranks up there with those two.  So if you enjoyed those two movies, I think you will enjoy this one.  The acting was terrific by all, Brad Pitt was ferocious and unforgiving, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom did exceptionally well (Although I wasn't too fond of the characterization of Blooms character, he pulled it off masterfully) and the one of a kind Richard Harris overshadows them all.  The casting was excellent, although you will hear many people think that the actress portraying Helen was not beautiful enough, but to be honest that is one hard character to cast.  I think it must be difficult to cast a woman whose beauty started a war.  The sets were spectacular and the pace of the film was fast, I was never bored or looked at my watch the entire time.  This film is violent, so not for the kiddies, but not flamboyantly so.  It really explores such topics as honor and family loyalty, and honestly I think this movie was great, and can't understand why it didn't do better.  Once again I will reiterate that if you are looking for a faithful adaptation of Homer, you might as well look somewhere else.  Just take it for what it is, a epic Hollywood summer blockbuster.  I will definitely be adding this to my DVD collection January 4th.  Please watch this movie, and make up your own mind, I don't think you will be disappointed.Please watch this movie, and make up your own mind, I don't think you will be disappointed.
B0002DRDBE|3.0|I love the movie Clerks, but how can you possibly rate this new release of this movie, and all the extras, when it has not even been released, nor is this version available for public viewing?  Use this ratings forum for what it is designed for...any post prior to this should have been under the original release of the movie, not an unreleased version. Call me crazy, but that is how I see it.  By the way, I am looking forward to the new release...especially now that I have read all the 5-star reviews.  Love ya...mean it!
B00005V3Z4|2.0|Now before you write off my review as useless, I'll say this much: most people (especially western-culture teens) will like this film.  People apparently like it very much when a film \\"messes with their heads\\" (in the words of one avid reviewer), especially when it espouses \\"trendy\\" teen philosophies such as the stupidity of mentors (be they teachers or parents) and the meaninglessness of everything.  Classic \\"teen angst\\" things really.    What this film does is it presents us with an antisocial, depressed  teen nutcase who embodies all of the above philosophies, and then justifies his actions.    Donnie Darko, who comes from a VERY rich family judging by their house, commits one crime after another in the film, speaks dumb jokes to his \\"friends\\" and wipes out a whole branch of physics with a single sentence (\\"wouldn't it be possible to travel backwards through time by travelling faster than light?\\").  The movie glorifies him through all of this, presenting him as some kind of messiah who is the only one who has seen the light.     Yes, I can see why so many people like this. Wouldn't it be nice if it were REALLY that way? If those stuffy scientists, teachers, and parents were really wrong about everything, despite all of their hard work and dedication? Wouldn't it be nice if all you had to do to know the Truth would be to have some hairbrained notion in your drug-hazed head about what is really right (yes, Donnie Darko is constantly on anti-depression drugs throughout this movie)?     This film will indeed \\"mess with people's heads\\", but it won't clear them, which in my mind is what trully great filmmaking should do.  Donnie Darko, with its false and depressing interpretation of the world, is flawed at its most fundamental level.      It's full of plot-holes as well. Here's one: how does a TORNADO make someone travel faster than light?    The only reason I gave this 2 stars is that the cinematography is rather good.      In closing, if you are the type of person who likes enlightening films, avoid this one like the plaque! There are far, far better films out there about life's mysteries that warrant viewing, like the 1972 Solaris, Come and See, The Passion of Joan of Arc, Au Hasard Balthazar (due out on dvd in 2005) and Wild Strawberries.    This film may be \\"smart\\", but it takes itself too seriously for a film whose underlying ideas have no basis in reality.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I've just bought this album, and the only reason I'm not asking for my money back is because I am too much of a Parsons fan. I'm extremely disappointed. This is not the Alan Parsons we all know and treasure. <br /> <br />The album contains just nine tracks, two of which are rehashes of previous classics. All tragically techno-trendy-pop. As a 20-year fan of AP, I am very sorry to admit that while listening to the CD I found myself agreeing with the words of John Cleese dubbed over the last track: \\"How much longer is this going on?\\". It's so bad I was happy to hear the end of it. <br /> <br />Unless you like random baby noises and barking dogs and electronified remakes of what were already *perfect* tracks (Mammagamma, A Dream Within a Dream), don't buy this album. If you revere AP as much as I do, don't even ask to listen to a friend's copy. You'll be as stunned as you were after seeing the final episode of The Prisoner, and for the very same reasons (if you saw it, you know exactly what I mean). <br /> <br />I'm very sorry to have to write this review, but I think Parsons fans need to be warned. Seeing an iconic figure fall like this is really sad. <br /> <br />Please, Alan, if you read this, go back to your roots. Update them, but don't deny them. The Time Machine was brilliant: electronic, up-to-date, but with the distinct Parsons flavor. This is just random sound without justification. Anyone can make \\"music\\" like this.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|My ex-girlfriend first suggested this show to me last year, and I was skeptical.  I thought it would be some boring soap opera, and I really didn't care for the premise.  But, this show is so good and entertaining that, I can't stop watching it.   <br /> <br />The funny thing is, I can't figure out what I love about it, and why it's better than other shows I like a lot such as Dawson's Creek, and 7th Heaven.  The chemistry is probably the part that gets me the most, especially between our central characters:  Lorelai and Rory, Lorelai and Emily, Sookie and Lorelai, Sookie and Jackson, Luke and Lorelai, Rory and Paris, Rory and Lane.  It's well scripted and the acting is top notch. <br /> <br />Besides all that, what else is there?  The story arc is fantastic, as bland as it could have been.  Lorelai is a 32 year old mother of a teenage daughter, Rory, who's almost 16.  Lorelai has raised her daughter on her own in a small town called Stars Hollow, in Connecticut, along with some help with many great friends along the way (Luke, Bebe + Maury, Miss Patty, Sookie St. James, and Rory's best friend Lane, and soon to enter would be Paris, and Dean.).  The best part is that nobody really has a background role.  All the roles are pretty important to each character in some way, and it's all connected.  A lot of real life situations are met along the way:  Rory starts a new school, Rory's first kiss, Lorelai and Rory's english teacher date, Rory's school dance and not being home by curfew, pressures by an overbearing mother and father, class differences, jealousy, birth out of wedlock, etc.  All are taken seriously, but are not over done, nor are they melodramatic as they are in shows such as Dawson's Creek, or even Full House.   <br /> <br />I think what I love most is how much I see in Rory and Lorelai's great relationship.  I see a lot of me in both of them (even though I am male).  And their mother-daughter relationship is very familiar to me.  It's nice to see that kindof thing on TV, something that not all families get to share.  That awesome closeness, coupled with the dark juxtaposition between Lorelai, and her mom.   <br /> <br />This show really is for everyone, and I really encourage everyone to check this show out.  You won't be disappointed, I promise.
0066620996|2.0|I read the first two chapters of \\"Good to Great.\\"  <br />The book has some really great examples of the traits inherent in a great leader and company, but some of the reasons it gives as to why you should have a great company and be a \\"5 Level Leader\\" are just blatantly stupid. <br />I found that what they are deeming a \\"great\\" company is whether they were Fortune 500 Companies. That's it! That's all! Nothing more. That's what makes a great company? Wow. <br />One of their primary examples is a CEO that finally made his company great (Gillette) and then had himself a heart- attack.  <br />Great example. <br />They mention that if the CEO hadn't prevailed then \\"none of us would be shaving with Sensor, Sensor for Women, or Mach 3 - leaving hundreds of millions of people to a more painful daily battle with stubble.\\" <br />Great argument for why you should put yourself before the company. <br />I was going to read further but didn't have the stomach  . . . <br />
B00000GAIW|5.0|Answer this: What rock song can you name that remotely approaches the originality and unorthodox composition of this album's title track?...<br />I didn't think so.  Ian Anderson never snarled like this anywhere else in the vast Tull catalog, and even admittedly poor production (bad bass and drum sound; overall mid-range-y) can't diminish the sheer force of such songs as \\"My God\\", \\"Cross Eyed Mary\\", and \\"Wind Up\\" on this unforgettably unique CD. Even the shorter acoustic pieces are wonderful!<br />As a teenager who had never heard of the group, I bought it for its strange cover...and 33 years later, it still packs a wallop. As always, thanks for reading...Ant
0805211063|5.0|Kafka gives us an image of man, one hauntingly disturbed, in which forces, prevalent everywhere, and without reason, crash down upon us as we drown in a vertigo of still and silent sadness.<br /><br /> He relates the adventures of K., who comes to \\"The Castle\\".  It seems like no one wants him, the land surveyor, there.  The situations become surreal...involving a promotion to Janitor, a woman named Frieda, and a menacing Schoolteacher.<br /><br /> In the end, we all go away.  And, while we are, it is as if we already were gone.  Such is the state of mind one will find in Kafka's book, that of being insignificant in world that is hostile to our every move, that pushes us down, and only seeks to move us up when it is to its own advantage.  And, the sad yet seemingly happy people we see everywhere, who come and go like seasons that never return, they serve only to remind us how love is only conditional in a `world that is a will to power, and nothing besides'.  \\"Our only hope is blindness.\\"<br /><br />Also recommended: Toilet: The Novel by Michael Szymczyk (A Tribute to the Literary Works of Franz Kafka)
B000002KB8|5.0|This is where it all began for Black Sabbath, and though they released some fine LP's featuring some excellent tracks in the following decade, this one is still the strongest overall in my estimation. I love hearing Ozzy sing in his natural (lower) register on the classic title track and on \\"The Wizard\\". The recorded sonic clarity of the album overall, and of each different cymbal in Bill Ward's drum kit, has never been equalled on subsequent releases (including the follow-up 'Paranoid', although it came close). Tony Iommi was, and still is, the most underrated guitarist in his field, and bassist Geezer Butler, too, is always distinctive and solid. The second half of this landmark album, beginning with \\"Wicked World\\", flows beautifully through different movements, including some raw blues. This was recorded in a couple of days' time, which makes the result all the more remarkable and speaks to the boys' great instincts for making this kind of music right from the start.  Groundbreaking indeed, and the greatest album of its kind...(Also, please see my reviews for King Crimson's first Lp and Tull's 'Aqualung', in addition to Sabbath's 'Last Supper' DVD)...Ant

B000003S09|5.0|Know this: This is just MAGICAL...absolutely one of the most unique albums ever conceived. If King Crimson had retired their name after this (their first LP), their place in progressive rock history would still be assured.  I consider this, along with 'Aqualung' (Jethro Tull; see my review), as being among the most daring recorded works ever produced in any musical genre.  That they both came from the same relative era is no surprise (take a look sometime at the Billboard LP charts from that late sixties-thru-mid 70's time frame--the abundance of originality and creativity in the rock field was STAGGERING, to say the least).  Even given that, this album will always stand out for me for the above qualities, for the sheer beauty of its imagery, and also for the SURREAL mood it creates EVEN NOW. Peace, Ant
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is probably one of the best albums ever. This band just plain rocks i saw them in concert and it blew my mind. They are able to put you in a trance with their awsome music and haunting vocals. This is a must have for any music lover. one of my favorite songs is Leif Erickson which has the perfect combination of vocals and guitar melodies. Its just amazing...they're amazing.
B000094JA6|5.0|I have a half-dozen bootleg albums of Led Zeppelin concerts from the mid-1970s salted away, which means that when it comes to listening to the group in live performance the sound on \\"How the West Was Won\\" is actually a step up from what I was used to during Led Zep's glory years. But even if your experience to Led Zeppelin live is limited to the soundtrack for \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" you can still appreciate the way the group refused to simply get up on stage and play their songs the way they appeared on their albums. \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" were always an opportunity to indulge in the wide variety of musical forms that had inspire Jimmy Page and Robert Plant. This is why when you listen to the former you find John Lee Hooker's \\"Boggie Chillun,\\" Jerry Leiber's \\"Let's Have a Party,\\" Gene Pitney's \\"Hello Marylou,\\" and James B. Oden's \\"Going Down Slow\\" into the mix. But during the later Led Zep would reference its own work, both known (\\"The Crunge\\") and unknown (\\"Walter's Walk\\"). Both \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Bring It On Home\\" are extended in similar ways as well, playing to the group's strengths.<br /><br />The tracks collected here are taken from two concerts, recorded two days apart, in June of 1972. The order of the 18 tracks follows the set list for those two concerts, with the only omission from both concerts being \\"Tangerine\\" from the acoustic set that ends Disc 1 (Disc 3 has half of the encore material from the L.A. gig, which apparently went on much longer than the one in Long Beach, including \\"Louie Louie,\\" \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Communication Breakdown\\"). The bottom line is that \\"How the West Was Won\\" is one of those albums where the fact that it has previously unreleased live Led Zeppelin music is enough to make you decide whether or not you want to pick it up, even if you already have any of the bootlegs that exist (I have one of 1973 Forum concert that was Bonzo's 25th birthday, but that is not this one).<br /><br />Even when you are aware of the similarities between some of the songs that are on both this album and \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" there are always some significant differences that makes you appreciate the way Led Zep usually made their songs extended jam sessions. Besides, you get a version of the one song that is in the concert film of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" but not on the album, \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" which is a Led Zeppelin blues classic that I never thought got the credit it deserved.  The expectation is not that \\"How the West Was Won\\" is going to converst anybody.  This CD-collection is for the faithful.are of the similarities between some of the songs that are on both this album and \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" there are always some significant differences that makes you appreciate the way Led Zep usually made their songs extended jam sessions.

B00006IUL6|5.0|I never expected Robin Williams to be so good as the villian in this picture.  In this one we see early on that he plays a cat and mouse game with Pacino.  Pacino's character accedently kills his partner while he's chasing Williams.  He knows this and never lets him forget it thoughout the movie.  All in all it's a movie you can watch again because the characers in it are so interesting.  So if you bought this one in the budget bin like I did you won't be sorry for the money you spent for it.  There is lots of good dialogue and character bits here.  For Hitchcock fans (who remember him) ...it is in the tradition of his films because you don't know what to expect.
B0002G2B2M|5.0|There are too many bad drama movies! Why?<br /><br />  I can tell you many reasons:<br /><br />  1. The script is booring and it has nothing special to say<br /><br />  2. Actors are horrible, they have only dimension and they<br /><br />  can't touch your soul.<br /><br />  3. Director coudn't offer aanything own.<br /><br /> Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind is very strange, touching, personal movie which has lot of to say.<br /><br /> Main actors are Jim Carrey(Joel) and Kate Winslet(Clementine)<br /><br /> They have been lovers some time ago but something went wrong.<br /><br /> Clementine wanted to erase all memories which are connected to Joel. After this she can't know Joel at all. Joel are very sad and angry for this. He wants to do same operation. When \\"scientists\\" begins to do this operation, Joel realises that also good memories are going to erase. I am not sayin anything more about script because it is not useful. This movie is must to see. Because Jim and Kate makes their best roles ever.<br /><br /> They are very good! Script is one the most creative ever! Being John Malkovich is close to this but in my opinion, this movie is better.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This was the worst film of 2001 but the DVD is good. Ben Affleck was the worst actor in the film. I give Kate Beckinsale a razzie for her smile. I give Josh Hartnett a razzie for crying. And Michael Bay should be ashamed of himself for turning something Historical into trash. If you want to see something great about Pearl Harbor, go see \\"Tora Tora Tora\\".
B000001FZK|5.0|I did not fall in love with \\"Laughing Stock\\". I was not accustomed to the strange ambience and jazz dynamics.   <br /> <br />I assure you, this is needed.

B00005JKZ3|2.0|I didn't like the first one, but the sequel is worse. Will Smith was horrible but Tommy Lee Jones was great. The plot sucked, Rip Torn was terrible, and The directing was... bad. \\"Men In Black 2\\" makes \\"Bad Company\\" look Shakespearean.

B000274THQ|5.0|Goodbye, Lenin gets better every time I think about it.  A comedy, a history lesson, a sweet-hearted story of filial love, the film impresses on every level and from every angle, including cinematic.  For example, the scene that provides the visual image of the title, as the recovering mother looks out the window of her painstakingly recreated room, is at once simple, eloquent, and plainly unforgettable.   <br /> <br />But is the mother really what she seems?  That's the question and the final subtlety of the film.  Consider:  the long lie about the reason for her husband's flight to West Germany; the gadfly letters she writes for others to complain of the Communist society's products and practices; the fact that her heart attack occurs as she sees her son beaten by the Stasi; the murmuring scene with her son's girlfriend toward the end of the film; the way she watches her son even as she is watching the final elaborate hoax he has mounted to explain why East Germany no longer exists.  And three days later he scatters her ashes, as clueless to her real nature and feelings about the East German state as, in a completely different context and movie, the son in The Deep End is about his Mom and what she did for him.  <br /> <br />Whatever you have to do, don't miss this movie.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I went to see this looking for some truthful information but all I got was one man rambling on about his own opinion.  Nothing in the film supports what he was saying.  Before I was unsure who to vote for and I know Moore's goal was to brainwash everyone with his bs to vote for Kerry or anyone but Bush but since I watched this I am afraid to side with Mr. Moore.  Not worth a penny unless you like seeing a man overly consumed with hatred rambling on about nothing.
0375713751|4.0|This book tells the story of Kate Reddy, a workaholic mutual fund manager and mother of two.  By taking the readers through the overwhelming detail of Kate's life, Pearson illustrates the difficulties women face balancing work and family.   <br /> <br />The book is a fast read and has the feel of chick-lit.  This makes Kate Reddy's life easily available to busy female readers.  Parts of the book seem a little simplified and especially in the early section, the reader feels beat over the head with the message that the balancing life is tough.  But it is light reading with a serious message.  Interspersed throughout the text are some insightful and thought-provoking statements about the state of the world and the difficulties women have in molding themselves to a world set up for men's success. <br /> <br />What frustrated me about the book was that while Pearson admirably chronicled Kate's thoughts and feelings and eventual sacrifice, she didn't really tackle the issues of why women are forced to assume so much responsibility.  In this book, Kate herself, by wanting to meet the expectations of everyone, from her employer to the Court of Motherhood, was a participant in her own hanging.  While her husband encouraged her to cut back on some of the domestic responsibilities, she didn't feel she could.  But despite both Kate and Richard's enlightened outlook, there was never a discussion about Richard cutting back on his work, despite the fact that Kate was the main breadwinner.   <br /> <br />This book opens the discussion of an issue that is critical to the future of working mothers.  I hope that other authors will take off from Pearson's work and go beyond the despair to investigate more deeply the causes of the double burden and to suggest solutions for both the individual and the societal level. <br />
B000092ZYX|2.0|There is a handful a tracks that are good but the majority is filler. Compared to their last three albums, this is dull. Some songs are beguiling as good but are just mediocre with excellent production. But as usual with Radiohead, many of the songs are chilling. But because I have to press 'skip' so many times I never want to put it on. So it collects dust.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Not being religious I have no bias toward watching a Christ figure get caned, torn up and crucified, however watching Scorsese brilliant, if too long, The Last Temptation of Christ (the temptation being Lucifer offering Christ a mans life if he gives up his role as the savior, guess which choice Jesus makes?)I was able to become involved with the character and what drove him. In Gibson's telling of the last 12 hours (with a few flashbacks to fill in plot holes)I get nothing but a feeling that Christ should have just stayed down when he had the chance.<br /><br />Let me make some points here:<br /><br />First: The story starts with Judas selling out Christ, it should have started with Christ coming to the Temple and saying he would tear it down and rebuild it in three days. This is the thing that inflamed the Jews to want him dead so bad, he threatened their power. Leaving this out of the film only leaves the viewer trying to grasp why they hated him.<br /><br />Second: No emotional involvement. Gibson tries to let the torture speak for itself. There's nothing more than fleeting flashbacks with Jesus (pronounced hea'shu) and either Mary his mother or his love, nothing to emotionally attach them to him, or us. Watching his mother weep over him when he gets back up after a brutal beating is called to an end, inflaming the Romans to inflict more damage, feels hollow. We haven't established anything beyond \\"this is mom.\\" He could have pointed the camera at any weeping extra in the crowd and put a subtitle \\"my son!\\" under her with equal impact. You have to ask, what the hell did he get up for? To be hurt more! Why? So he'd be a martyr. You know, I want Kerry elected president, should I invite Republicans to beat me to death to prove how horrible I think they are? There is a scene in The Village where a character is stabbed, there's nearly no blood, zero gore, yet the emotional impact is heavy, you fear for his life, you feel for his girl and you hate his killer. There's a castration scene in I Spit On Your Grave that shows nothing because it all takes place under a bubble bath, yet you know it's happening and you squirm and you want to look away. Then there's the F*** me Jesus scene in the Exorcist when you desperately want the suffering of the little girl to stop. In this film I just wanted Jesus to Stop Getting Up!<br /><br />Third: Gibson's Christ is not a persecuted Jew trying to lead people to the love of God, his father, he's a self righteous [dumber] who says \\"father my heart is ready\\" before torture \\"Father, why have you forsaken me\\" when he's nailed to a cross and \\"I'm ready\\" when he's had enough. Now why does he tell God he's ready to be flayed, then complain when it happens. Christ offers himself up for torture, then looks on as if to say, \\"see what I do for you?\\" Well, how asked him?<br /><br />Forth: No conclusion. Not only does Gibson not bother to show us why they Jews hate him (oddly, only Pilot's motivations are clearly shown, in the end he's the one you feel bad for, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, but doesn't what his head off either.) but doesn't show that any good comes out of it.<br /><br />Fifth: The Devil. What's with the Nelly - Demon - Reaper??? Some androgynous freak torments Christ, yeah, see the root of homophobia is that Gibson portrays Tran gendered people as Lucifer.<br /><br />Sixth: Now Ascension? What the hell, he rises and fade to black? What's this? Where's the lords message? Nowhere in this film. This film is a knock-off of Barker's Hellraiser. 127 minutes of torture with no beginning and no conclusion. A three hour film would have let us see Christ live and love before the crucifixion, and let us see the impact of resurrection. However Gibson just wanted an exploitation of pain thinly veiled as religious rhetoric.<br /><br />Last: If you believe in Christ, share what he stood for, not how he died! Peace, Love, Good Will. Not self righteous martyrs! Not Pain! Not Violence! Not hate and ignorance! This is a film only for those who know the entire story by heart because this is just one long scene way out of context.<br /><br />Finally: See the Last Temptation of Christ and Dogma, two misunderstood films made by people who love there lord and savior and want people to walk out with the positive not negative. Enough with the hell and damnation, let Clive Barker do that, he's better at it.heart because this is just one long scene way out of context.

B0002DB52M|4.0|... it takes your head off.  <br /> <br />\\"Dogville\\" reminds me of that old story about how Andy Kaufman, back when he was alive and still doing stand-up routines, used to go into comedy clubs and jump onstage and psych up the crowd. . . and then proceed to read huge sections of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" into the microphone - no funny voices, no winking, just page after page recited in a clipped voice.  <br /> <br />Sometimes the audience grew hostile, sometimes the audience walked out, a small minority found it ingenious but whatever the response, Kaufman read the book until he wanted to stop.  <br /> <br />And while having F. Scott Fitzgerald read to you is arguably a worthwhile way to spend an evening, that understandably wasn't the evening most of the patrons wanted yet Kaufman did it just to rub them the wrong way.  <br /> <br />\\"Dogville\\" is the same kind of deal: It's definitely worthwhile, but it wants to rub viewers the wrong way; some will grow hostile, some will stop watching and a small minority will find it ingenious.  <br /> <br />The movie stars Nicole Kidman, and was directed by Lars von Trier, who made the similarly challenging \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" and \\"Breaking the Waves.\\" It's a two-hour, 57-minute drama set in the tiny Colorado town of Dogville in what might be the 1930s. The entire film, however, takes place on a large, mostly empty stage. Buildings and houses and even a household pet are designated by chalklines on the floor; daytime is indicated by blinding white light beyond the perimeter of the set, nighttime by impenetrable blackness; and the population consists of 15 unwashed, crotchety adults and a few creepy kids.  <br /> <br />Kidman plays Grace, a mysterious woman who winds up in town on the run from both gangsters and the police. The citizens are suspicious at first but agree to hide her and, in exchange, she helps them with chores. For a while everyone is happier, but the heroines in von Trier movies rarely avoid injury and humiliation at the hands of angry mobs and, sure enough, Grace's relationship with Dogville soon sours, and the people take greater and greater advantage of her until finally she wishes the gangsters would find her.  <br /> <br />So what we have here is a three-hour chronicle of unlikable people doing cruel things to a nice woman against a boring back-drop. There are also hints that Von Trier is lashing out specifically at America (the action takes place on a street called Elm, a particularly spineless character is named Tom Edison, Grace's circumstances take a turn for the worst on Independence Day and \\"Young Americans\\" plays over the end credits).  <br /> <br />Obviously, this is not a movie with mass appeal and although I admire von Trier's will to be weird, I slogged through the first two-thirds of \\"Dogville\\" like it was a homework assignment; it's tedious for long stretches and sometimes feels like bloated bad theater.  <br /> <br />I'm glad I stuck with it, though, because the movie delivers one tremendous wallop at the end, when an audacious and complex twist occurs and we find out what the movie is really all about. But is it a compliment to say that a film becomes engrossing after the first hour-and-a-half, and that it really pays off if you can make it through the first 160 minutes? I'm not sure, but I know that without the excessive length, it probably wouldn't pack the same punch. And I'm also pretty sure that while many who see it will find \\"Dogville\\" dullsville, others will see it as a bitter allegory about slavery, exploitation and casual corruption and, to an extent, both groups will be correct.  <br />

But it's packed with tons of useful info and hints: Improve the homepage, navigation (main, secondary, other levels), \\"I'm here\\" signs (breadcrumbs, page titles, site IDs), page noise reduction, page scannability, and more. All this information is scattered on the web, but the author has done well by putting them together and presenting them in a way that makes sense. <br /> <br />Mr. Krug does a good job of explaining how you can better your website by using common sense web usability. The author is also not afraid to share too much of his knowledge with you, which makes for enlightening and pleasant reading.

0671027387|5.0|This is the second Dan Brown novel I've read and I really enjoyed both.  I'd stay up all night just to see what's going to happen next.  Definitely hard to put down.  I highly recommend it.  It's very clever with a lot of cliff hangers.  You won't be able to wait to find out who the bad guy/gal is.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I can hardly express how happy I am that this classic movie, in all of it's forms, are getting the DVD treatment they so deserve! <br /> This set comes with the theatrical release, director's cut, and the european version done by Dario Argento with more music by Goblin! <br /> Known in Italy as Zombie 1, Dawn of the Dead has been a cult classic since it's release in 1979, and until recently, very hard to come by. This set really is the ultimate edition and the ultimate salute to Romero's classic zombie movie. I hope that with the release of this 4 disc set more people will get the chance to enjoy each version of this timeless classic, and then maybe give the other movies in the trilogy a try. <br /> Ultimatly, I hope to see a remastered trilogy of the dead box set with in depth now and then history of the classic masterpeices, so these films will live on and always be appreciated for what they really are; great! <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|The very first time I heard these guys, I absolutely hated them, I thought the singers voice was so annoying. As I listened to it more and more, I have realized how incredible these guys are! They are so musically talented with everything, the drummer has crazy beats and theguitarist has amazing cords! These guys are on of the most tlented artists out there! Other Sweet Tracks are 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10!
B00000JPH6|5.0|When i watch the Dark Crystal I can't help but feel that Tolkien's LOTR books had a huge influence on Jim Henson and Frank Oz. It was almost as if they were just retelling it and shortening it up into a viewer friendly hour and a half. Great imagination and time went into making this movie and it shows in the fantastic visualy pleasing world of the Dark Crystal.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|You have to see this, you also have to read some McNamara reference material, namely his autobiography. Then ask yourselves one question.<br />Given that there are 50,000+ plus names up on the \\"Black Wall\\" and armed with all the new information you have acquired on McNamara from McNamara... plus all the Post Viet Nam related deaths, suicides, emotional struggles etc...<br /><br />Why isn't McNamara in prison?<br /><br />A very insightful interview, I recommend reading the McNamara autobiography as a precursor to viewing this.  A statistician such as McNamara was able to calculate his way through the mire of Viet Nam; strongarming policy,and making tactical decisions he had absolutely no business making; furthermore he justified his actions/decisions.  Was his justification actually self-denial amid the abysmal failure of Viet Nam and the consequencial negative impact on hundreds of thousands of the effected generation!? Amazing!<br /><br />I have to ask the question that:  Given that there are 50,000+ plus names up on the \\"Black Wall\\" in addition to all the revealing information on McNamara from McNamara, add up all the Post Viet Nam related deaths, suicides, emotional and substance struggles and abuse.<br /><br />Why isn't McNamara in prison?<br /><br />Documentaries (and books) such as this put a whole new slant on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, they were as corrupt as Nixon, and as slippery as Clinton.  I really wish all who laud and praise the Kennedy administration would realize what a negative influence that administration had on so many of the generation it put to war.<br /><br />After Nixon negotiated a \\"Peace with honor\\" tradeoff with Hanoi and after the debacle was finally over, was JFK's oft-quoted  \\"ask what you can do for you country\\" in reality a verbal death knell?  What were people in power thinking as thousands of America's youth joined Kennedy on the hillsides of Arlington cemetery?<br /><br />Why isn't McNamara in prison?

B00028HBKC|1.0|2 Peter 2:21 says that when God communicates His truth to us He uses \\"Holy men of God...inspired by the Holy Spirit\\". Mel Gibson and Hollywood hardly fit that criteria.  2 Corintians 11 warns us clearly about those disguised as \\"angels of light...ministers of righteousness\\" - that is, those who pretend to serve God and Christ while really fulfilling another agenda. Bullseye!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Alot of people criticize this movie for being too violent when they haven't even seen it. If you are a true lover of cinema you will appreciate this film. Yes there's lots of blood, gore and violence but if you give it a chance you will see that it is all so over the top, it is almost cartoonish and you won't take it so seriously. <br /> If you have seen it and aren't going to watch the vol.2 because you think it is more of the same, you will be pleasantly surprised with a diologue rich, fraction of the violence, well completed story of revenge. So if you have made it through vol.1, treat yourself to vol.2 you will be glad you did!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am amazed by the number of people who claim to have seen this movie and gave it a single star.  Many of their statements are just not true.  Moore does not attack veterans he shows them in many lights most are just like the guy next door.  In fact Moore does not show any distaste for anyone serving in the military, he just points how some of the leaders of this country have failed them.  <br /> <br />This movie is not vile or mean spirited though at times it is very very sad.  I urge you to not take anyone's word about this movie just see it for yourself.  After seeing this movie I did do some fact checking and was surprised it was so accurate.  The biggest error was that the president was not reading 'MY PET GOAT' on 9/11 it was 'THE PET GOAT'.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Soo...Kill Bill 2. What can I say? I watched it after seeing Kill Bill 1 for the first time (which, by the way, left me breathless and in shock, and I hated Pulp Fiction), and it blew me away. Ok, so maybe not the endless get-out-of-the-freaking-coffin-already! scenes (although they were well shot, and included Pai Mei, I wish that they had been hurried along). But Budd and Elle (I loved Budd- wish he could have been a good guy...but man, he made for a good character, eh?) made up for it. Was it boring at times? Yes, absolutely. The second time I watched it, I stopped fast forwarding only to see Elle's eye land on the floor (and to hear her screaming and cursing...hah! Some people claim all that yelling to be extraneous, but I found it hilarious and a wierd comic touch on pain) and to see Uma turn around that corner in Bill's ranchero mansion and...Wow.  <br /> <br />         Being a feminist, and having seen the marvelous touches of respect in Kill Bill 1 (\\"This is what you get for f***ing around with yakuza clans!...now go home to your mother!\\" AHHHHAAA! Why is that striking and funny? I don't know, but I think that The Bride exerting her own force as a mother (albeit a thwarted mother) strikes a chord. A big one.), that turn around the corner made Kill Bill 2 one big Steel-Magnolia-sized chick flick for me, with a little dash of Divine Secrets thrown in. As one reviewer stated, killing Bill didn't really matter anymore; taking back what was hers (happiness) did. When you see Uma's face light up, that's when to break out the kleenex box. There was no finer moment than that for me.  <br /> <br />          Speaking of, a lot of people complain about the long, fatuous ending which skimps on Bill and  splurges on BB (where in the hell did that name come from?), I have to say that, well, you interpreted it wrong. The movie has itself come to the conclusion (without you) that what is driving the Bride is not revenge, so much, but a longing for lost happiness and one bigmissed opportunity. Yes, her decision to marry was a little strange and more than a little desperate. However, it makes the coming full circle that much sweeter. The Bride is really determined to make this kid's life awesome and free (as much as anyone's can be)from danger. Selfish? Yes. Human instinct? Yes. I don't know, but it gives me warm feelings. <br />Shockers (besides the corner one) in this movie: Having seen Pulp Fiction, I believed with all my heart that Uma Thurman is one of the ugliest actresses I have ever seen (perhaps it was that awful black hair). O man,was I wrong. She lights up the screen, and her intelligent, quiet acting makes her look beautiful, enhancing her with a quirky, violent charisma. Hell, this movie made even Lucy Liu look good! (Chicago? Charlie's Angels? I don't think so, darling! Stick to where the hair works for you.) The traditional Japanese stuff , not to mention the short Farrah Fawcett hair, did her some good. Wow. Kill Bill 1 +2 not only made my day as a feminist, they did some good in the world by making ugly people look good! (ok, some I'm a touch shallow. Sue me, eh?) It could be a tagline. Kill Bill: Making ugly people attractive through the power of good lighting and great acting. Thank you, Quentin!
0446677450|1.0|I believe he is making more money selling the book than doing what he explain on the book. <br /> <br />Vague Ideas, \\"look neat ideas\\" in paper but not that good on practice.   <br /> <br />It contradict itself in one part.  It said in the middle of the book if you have few eggs to be brave and put it all in one basquet instead of few eggs on different basquets. <br /> <br />At the end of the book he said that you have to keep your eggs on different baskets.   <br /> <br />I fo not think all the realism that is on the book.  I read he has 4 employments.  The last one was in Xerox company.  From there he build up a his empire and while he was still working at Xerox he bought a Porche. <br /> <br />I heard his cashflow books and he said he was dead broke for many years.  Where fit this time frame on the first book? <br /> <br />I think he made or exagerate some of his stories and the best income are from the Intellectual property of the books.   <br /> <br />As he said it in the book. \\"Its not well written, but it sells by the tittle he put in it\\" <br /> <br />

B00003CXCT|3.0|Aw heck, why not join in?<br /><br />It is simple to explain:<br /><br />Han Solo is the coolest character in the Star Wars Trilogy.<br /><br />He is cool because of his moral ambiguity.<br /><br />His moral ambiguity is established in the scene where he shoots Greedo FIRST.<br /><br />Changing that scene takes away the moral ambiguity it established, and makes him less cool.<br /><br />Simple, yes?<br /><br />It's like the scene everyone loved in Raiders of the Lost Ark, when Indy just pulls out a gun and shoots the guy with the knives, instead of getting into a protracted and cliche \\"hero\\" fight with him. It's a wink at the audience that says \\"This guy doesn't play by the rules.\\"<br /><br />Maybe it's not what Lucas intended, but sometimes a creator's greatest achievements are the unintended ones.
B00005JMAH|3.0|Since when is Albus Dumbledore a hippie?  The new Dumbledore's attire looked so sloppy and grungy...and don't get me started on that little hat!  There was absolutely nothing respectable about him.  He looked as though he was a regular on Knockturn Alley.  And since when did Hogwarts have a huge clock?  Director dude... stick to the book!  This movie was way too short and a complete let down.  Thank goodness they're getting a new director.
B00008977N|5.0|This is my most-watched concert DVD - partly because it appeals to a wider range of visitors than most of my DVD's (Neil Young, Talking Heads, etc).<br />Peter has his usual stunning array of musicians and singers on hand to help out.  Paula Cole is a great addition as the female backup singer.  The DTS soundtrack is superb, flawed only by the rather egregious overdubbing of Peter's vocals.  Not that most people seem to notice.
0440217563|4.0|I  have read all the other reviews of these books on Amazon and am amazed at how seriously some reveiwers have undertaken the task of deconstructing this book and comparing it to the others in the series.  These are NOVELS; fiction; a.k.a. a bit of fun.  Who cares if the storylines are far fetched?  It is fiction.  For me these novels are just pure escape to a different time and place.  (I like to read them in sequence over about a week)  Don't take them too seriously, and don't expect that the author does either.  Have you read the Author's note published in Cross Stitch? <br /> <br />I have loved all the books about Jamie and Claire.  I applaud Voyager for continuing the story of their love.  I thoroughly enjoyed the stories of their far fetched adventures.   I fervently hope that Gabaldon writes of them again to wrap up some of the story lines that have been left hanging.   <br /> <br />Having read the other reviews, I have two comments to add-  <br /> <br />As to the homosexuality themes, I too find them all too frequent and irrelevant to the storylines.  The point had been made extremely well with Randall. I fail to see the point of Grey.  His relationship with Jamie is confusing. <br /> <br />As to the convoluted story lines, Gabaldon's publisher seems to be letting her get away with longer and longer novels. I enjoyed the passage in Drums of Autumn where Jamie and Grey discuss the length of books; the author obviously poking fun at herself.  But, the length of Voyager contributes to the loss of some of the magic of the first books.  If the author was made to focus on reducing length, then some of the more convoluted storylines could, at least, be tightened up.   Voyager was unweildy and looked as though it had been edited in a hit and miss fashion.  As a result, I found that it was, at times, difficult to follow.

0385512104|4.0|THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME is not, repeat not, a mystery. The protagonist is a fifteen-year-old autistic boy who discovers his next-door neighbor's poodle, stabbed to death with a garden fork. He then sets out to discover who did it and write about it as a project for school.<br /><br /> Christopher John Francis Boone is the narrator and he loves to \\"do the maths\\", can't stand to be touched, and hates the colors yellow and brown. He sprinkles red food coloring on his food because he loves the color red. The next-door-neighbor blames Christopher for the death of her poodle and calls the police. When the policeman touches him, Christopher hits him and is carted off to jail. They let him out when his father explains about his \\"no touching\\" policy. His father makes him promise to give up his search for the murderer of the poodle, but Christopher can't help himself. Complications ensue.<br /><br /> What's amazing about this book is how much we identify with Christopher, even though he occasionally wets himself and threatens people with a knife. When he sets off to find his mother, who he thought was dead, we are just as scared as he is. He tries to figure things out logically and is good at it, but then his nerves get to him and he shuts down totally, doing \\"the maths\\" in his head.<br /><br /> Mark Haddon worked with autistic children as a young man, so if one of his goals was to instill a greater understanding for \\"special needs\\" children, he succeeds wonderfully.
B000000OQF|5.0|My first album. I was 11 years old, and just starting to get into rock music. Mom wouldn't let me get, because it had \\"bad words\\" and such. So I convinced Dad to take me to the record store, and he bought it for me. He told me how, as a youngster in the 50s, his folks had let him listen to Elvis Presley, even though Elvis was \\"dirty and controversial\\" at the time, so he could relate to my situation. 16 years later, all I can is say \\"thanks dad!\\" Appetite For Destruction still stands as one of the greatest rock albums ever. I just wish I could find my original cassette tape of it!
0783226888|5.0|What can you say about a movie in which Bruce Willis plants two whoppers on his co-star---especially when it's a man!!!  That's only one of the surprises found in this retelling of Day of the Jackal.  Since today's society barely remembers Charles DeGaulle, director Michael Caton Jones and the screenwriter decided to update it and target a more \\"modern\\" victim----the First Lady.<br /><br />Aptly directed by Caton-Jones, this JACKAL is really a movie on its own, borrowing the title and main premise from Frederick Forsyth's popular novel.  Bruce Willis plays the Jackal, a nasty and villainous assassin, who has no qualms about shooting people, even his male comrade (which of course is merely one of Willis' many disguises).  Seeing Willis in such an anti-Willis role (like Mortal Thoughts and Death Becomes Her) is always a pleasure and he delivers a very solid performance.<br /><br />Richard Gere will never match the perfection of accents like Meryl Streep, but Gere has a presence that always lifts a film.  He gets to play the good guy this time, and does well.  Diane Venora as Valentina, the Russian cop, is splendid..Venora is one of our most overlooked and underappreciated actresses.  She is great in this role.  Sidney Poitier is bland, but effective.  Jack Black is annoying but effective in his small but impressive appearance.<br /><br />I liked this movie; it is escapism and well done.
B000002KYH|4.0|First of all, if you can find this on vinyl or even a stinking cassette, buy it!  Because the CD version is shortchanging you!  You can live without the cover of \\"The Great Pretender\\", but omitting \\"Guess I'll Always Love You\\" from the CD of this album is criminal!  One of Rod's great fun tunes...and it's not here.  <br /> <br />But, having said that, Rod delivers the live show, circa 1982 for his fans.  Look- Rod has never been anything more than sloppy.  Steampackat, Jeff Beck Group, Faces and his solo work- all sloppy.  Hell, the Faces made a LIVING off being sloppy!!!!  This live album is billed as \\"Absolutely Live\\" and Rod goes to great effort to tell us in the liner notes that this album contains no overdubs.  It's obvious there aren't!  And that why this live album is great! <br /> <br />It could use more old hits, but c'mon....in 1982, Rod was not worrying about singing a lot of old songs.  He does break out \\"Sweet Little Rock n' Roller\\", \\"Maggie May\\" and \\"Gasoline Alley\\" for the older fans.  His voice is undisputed in rock!  And all you need to do is listen to the ballads, \\"I Don't Want To Talk About It\\", and \\"Sailing\\", and the crowd singing along, to understand how great Rod is.  No, the American audience isn't as boistrous as a European crowd, but still Rod is in control.   <br /> <br />Rod brought out his three guitar attack on this tour, and it is strong.  I'm not thrilled that they still \\"funk it up\\" on songs like \\"Hot Legs\\".  I wish they'd have rocked out the way Rod did with this song on his Out Of Order Tour. But it doesn't matter.... the album is very good, and if you want a good, honest example of Rod in concert, you'll get it here!
1400034205|4.0|I think Maugham as a writer is most prominent as a miniaturist--he writes excellent scenes and episodes that coalesce into novels that, while not always greater than the sum of their parts, effectively crystallize different aspects of the human condition into lively collages.  This is the case with \\"The Razor's Edge,\\" which basically pertains to several fictionalized people with whom he hobnobbed while traveling around America and Europe between the World Wars and is narrated by the author himself in a relaxed, plainspoken voice. <br /> <br />Maugham introduces us to a circle of friends and acquaintances, most of whom are American, from various walks of life and levels of affluence.  At the center is a wealthy Chicagoan named Elliott Templeton--Maugham calls him a snob because he holds fashionable dinners attended only by the social elite and excludes those outside his class, but in actuality he is very generous and considerate, a devoted convert to Catholicism, a man of whose life the moral could be the ultimate emptiness of glamor, as illustrated by his lonely death.  Elliott's \\"sparkling and vivacious\\" niece Isabel is the feminine embodiment of the novel, an awkward girl who emerges as a graceful woman.  <br /> <br />Through Elliott we meet Isabel's boyfriend Larry, an affable, sensitive young man who represents the kind of protagonist with whom Maugham seems to identify the most--the restless soul, the open mind, the seeker of wisdom.  Having served as an aviator in the air corps during World War I and witnessed a friend die in valor, he is now idle and in no hurry to figure out what he wants to do with his life.  To Isabel's chagrin, he is not much interested in making a lot of money; he loves learning and would rather spend his time expanding his horizons, seeing the world and experiencing all it has to offer.   <br /> <br />While Larry is roaming the Orient finding himself, Isabel marries Gray, a very wealthy man until he is ruined in the New York stock market crash in 1929.  The self-knowledge Larry brings back from India and uses to revive Gray's spirits could be considered the crux of the novel, even though Maugham--ostensibly to tantalize the reader--tries to downplay its importance.  Larry also offers to marry the tragic Sophie, a wild American woman who has surrendered her life to alcohol, drugs, and promiscuity after her husband and child were killed in a car accident, but she refuses to be his \\"Mary Magdalen.\\" <br /> <br />Far from the taciturn, self-pitying semi-autobiographical Philip Carey of \\"Of Human Bondage,\\" the Maugham of \\"The Razor's Edge\\" is a confident and quietly amused cosmopolite who relishes his prestige as a famous author, a status that gives him a ticket to an echelon of society to which he knows he normally wouldn't be admitted.  He is fascinated by people and the stories they have to tell, relating them in breezy prose that obeys its aesthetic limits; and, suffusing the novel with the mood that America is slowly but surely supplanting England as the most militarily and financially powerful country in the world, gives a nod across the ocean to a readership that welcomed his books heartily. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000003FMY|5.0|This is one recording that lives up to its hype. On the podium, Fritz Reiner brings all of his storied strengths - an extraordinary sense of architecture, an outstanding ear for color, and an unparalleled (did someone say \\"sadistic\\"?) degree of discipline - to create the most beautifully conceived \\"Pictures\\" recorded in the 20th century. <br /> <br />But that's not all - in fact, that's not the half of it. The Chicago Symphony is superhuman in this recording, from the phenomonal opening solo trumpet passage of Adolph Herseth (in the first of his FIVE decades with the CSO) to the spectacular \\"Bydlo\\" of Arnold Jacobs on tuba, to the stupefying wall of sound in the final \\"Great Gate of Kiev\\" - well, the fact is that almost every orchestral player I know, on ANY instrument, refers to this recording as the gold standard for their own. <br /> <br />And the SOUND!... This was one of the first of the legendary RCA \\"Living Stereo\\" recordings (1957), and modern engineers could and should learn a lot about how to record an orchestra from these geniuses of the Eisenhower era. Another reviewer mentioned his disappointment in the \\"Catacombs\\" movement, and it's true - there are more sonically cogent recent performances (the Montreal Symphony under Charles Dutoit in a great recording comes to mind). But I would trade however many of those it would take to keep my SINGLE copy of this true wonder. <br /> <br />And there are additional treasures. \\"Pictures\\" was released on its own in LP form - it is joined here by CSO/Reiner recordings from 1959, including the best-played recording ever made of the \\"Colas Breugnon Overture,\\" a spectacular \\"Russlan and Ludmilla,\\" a very fine \\"Night on Bare Mountain\\" and \\"Marche Slav,\\" and other \\"minor\\" Russian pieces. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of the great recordings of the stereo era at a bargain price - snap it up and enjoy!
B00000INEX|5.0|I have a 2 year old daughter and a 3 year old son.  They've loved these videos since birth!  I'm amazed that even my 3 year old still loves and begs to watch these movies!  He got into the habit of saying Baby Outside instead of Baby Einstein and still calls it that at his age.  His favorites are Baby Bach and Baby Shakespear and both of my children will sit and watch the whole thing.  They love to identify the animals, shapes, pictures and colors.  They dance to the music and make animal sounds.  It's been a great learning tool as well as entertainment for our little ones.
B0002IU988|5.0|CREED's Mark Tremonti (guitar), Scott Phillips (drums) and Brian Marshall (bass) have teamed up with Myles Kennedy (vocals) to form ALTER BRIDGE...  I HIGHLY recommend this disc as with just a few listens, it will become an instant favorite!!! This band has a very cool sound as they obviously have the same signature style / feel of Creed (crunching guitar / powerful rhythms / solid song writing), but Kennedy gives the new music his own style with emotion and soaring vocals! Alter Bridge takes off where Creed left off and then some... Album of the year??? I think so! You can't go wrong buying this one!!!
B000000WJZ|5.0|When the Smashing Pumpkins first came on the scene who could have predicted this? Yeah, Gish was good, won debeut album of the year, but who would have thought that this amazing album would be next. With an amazing explosion of fury in the opening track \\"Cherub Rock\\" its clear Billy Corgan knew where he was going on this album. Gone was the mellow lulls of Gish. This albums was to rock, and it succeded.  <br />Siamese Dream is an amazing album not only for the amazing quitar and drum parts, but also due to the overlooked fact it's an amazing piece of concept art. It's all about the title. Siamese Dream is Corgan's fantasy or being attached to someone. Throughout almost every song he states how he's been abandoned and hurt all his life, and all he wants is someone who can't leave him, a siamese twin, so to speak. It's heartbreaking and powerful.  <br />The abandonment begins with \\"Quiet\\" an abrassive second track with awesome quitar solos and biting lyrics about Corgan's parents. \\"Be ashamed of this mess you've made\\" he sings bitterly. The album goes on to the hit \\"Today\\" which although many equate with being a happy song is anything but. \\"Today is the greatest day I've ever known.\\" It may sound happy, but the song is sarcastic and bitter, basically the tone for the entire album. It's hard to pick highlits on this album since every song is one of their best. \\"Disarm\\" however does stand firmly in the middle and provides a beautiful respite from the rest of the album. The haunting violins are beautiful behind Corgan's angry lyrics. \\"Disarm you with a smile and leave you like they left me here to wither in denile.\\" Perhaps the best track is \\"Soma\\" a blistering and emotional ballad that turns into a stormy quitar tornado. The theme of the album is stated so perfectly in this song. Corgan wants to be with someone no matter what the cost, even if it means being miserable. \\"So let the sadness come again, I'm glad you can depend on me yeah, until the bitter end of the world,when God sleeps in bliss. I'm all by myself.\\" <br />The album's last half is just as powerful with the ballad \\"Mayonaise\\" and the uptempo rock of \\"Geek USA\\" and \\"Silverf**k\\". The later is basically the finale a final bitter angry rant that sums up this album.  <br />What's so amazing is the final track. After all the angriness, loneliness, and bitterness, \\"Luna\\" is an amazing ballad of love which simply states he's finally found what he's been looking for. After all the angriness its nice to have this beautiful track last. <br />This album is a must have. One of the best albums of the 90's, it stands apart from all other albums of its time. It may not have spurned many rip off bands like Nirvana did, but the Pumpkins brought something to the table that had never been done before and has rarely been emulated since. <br />

B00024BHTC|1.0|What a naff album by a naff band!  Silly operative overtures with grunge guitar, bleedin awful vocals and stupid lyrics.  I hate this band, they do nothing for me.  In fact I'm embarrased to play any of their music!!!
B000000YG5|5.0|The word \\"masterpiece\\" is often abused here on Amazon. The five stars here are often abused too. So much albums are classified as \\"five stars\\" that you don't know how many stars you would need to make justice of this true masterpiece, of this true historical and essential album. This is something that could be rightly called \\"essential\\" and in the end a true \\"masterpiece\\" of the last century which has been so rich of true musical masterpieces by the way. In \\"Saxophone colossus\\" what you have it is simply the art of jazz at its highest level of expression. Sometimes history cristalized itself in a single moment, in a single event. \\"Saxophone colossus\\" is in my opinion the lucky perfect moment in which Jazz gave probably its overall best. It is the true zenith in Jazz. This happened right in that moment and in that place for some true clear reasons: this happened when the bop innovations have been completly acquired and explored, when free forms haven't already came to destroy the forms, where the third stream wasn't making it, it happened to a man who was a fantastic talent which has been lucky enough to work with all the best cats. It happens on the right label too (was not Blue Note). By the way it is still a fifties album, not a sixties one and this means a lot believe me. Some other players were equally important than Sonny Rollins (some other maybe even more, think of Bird), other albums has been more groundbreaking, other more courageous, other more creative (maybe) than \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" but this album is \\"Jazz\\". It is probably the most mature and complete Jazz album I know, the most flashing too, and I almost know them all. Some guys said here that Miles and Trane were bigger than Sonny. Sorry, I don't think so. In my opinion only Bird was bigger than Sonny and certainly not Miles neither Trane. Miles was a great charismatic figure, an inventive player, but only a decent trumpeter who didn't have the musicians quality Sonny had (noone who really knows Jazz can think different here). He didn't have a good technique he was not Navarro, Diz, Brownie, Morgan, Farmer on trumpet. Sonny was a technical master on saxophone, comparing them he was a better musician than Miles for sure. Trane was another historical figure for sure and he had chops impressive as Sonny's (or even bigger) but he tried too hard for what I am concerned to reach something new at the time and he did lose the sense of beauty, of balance in Jazz and the sense of \\"forms\\" (at least in his final period). And Trane didn't have the \\"irony\\" which is a tremendous quality for a musician. He was deadly serious, sometimes terribly boring. Sonny was funny, ironic, ... uncomparable. I love Trane of course, but Sonny is bigger than him for me. I don't remember a Trane album (and I own them all) beautiful as \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" so perfect in its forms, so clear in its intents, so creative inside the boundaries of the tradition but able to break them and to innovate too. So enjoyable, so delightful .. and I could go on forever! \\"Blue train\\" is great but its not equally perfect, enjoyable or funny. By the way Trane's \\"Blue train\\" it is surely another masterpiece but that's another story ..<br /><br />I love all the tunes here because they are really perfect in every sense, but if I have to point out one, my favourite tune would be \\"Strode rode\\". It is a fantastic minor speeder, Sonny outplay everyone in the biz here, he played some bop phrases which have killer logic, impressive timing, unbelievable melodical qualities, incredible strenghts. Obviously Sonny's rendition of \\"You don't know what love is\\" is equally superlative, a masterpiece in tenderness. It is a painting really. Noone played better that standard in the whole Jazz history, noone. Of course \\"St Thomas\\" is another perfect funny gem, like \\"Moritat\\" equally ironic and superlative. Well, it's a masterpiece, didn't I tell you? Buy it and simply enjoy probably the best album the history of Jazz has to offer.can think different here).

B0000507R0|3.0|Brain Salad Surgery was made for surround format and was sensational in Quad Discrete 4-channel back in the 70's and now it's here again in DVD-Audio.<br /><br />[I would highly recommend buying the Santuary SACD edition though. MUCH finer detail and remixing. The sound is incredible. One of the finest I have heard on SACD.]<br /><br />This recording is good, a bit \\"muddy\\". A little more attention should have been paid to the front-vs.-rear mix quality-wise. Occasionally (not always) the keyboards or vocals will die-out (especially during Karn Evil No. 9) when moving from front to rear, not matching the intensity or sonic fullness that they had in the rear speakers (sounding flat and hollow). But overall this is a good disc AND with the major extra track of Lucky Man (fantastic mix!!)!!<br /><br />I wish they'd release Tarkus and Trilogy on DVD-A (with extra tracks Knife Edge and Take A Pebble?), people are waiting!!<br /><br />Update:<br />ELPs first LP and Tarkus are now out on DVD-Audio and are incredible. Buy them, you won't be disappointed.
B000000OAC|3.0|Well, this album was a trip. I really liked it quite alot, but it was a little like slogging through mud at some parts. My favorite was \\"who needs you\\". It makes me really happy to hear that song. I also loved \\"All dead, All dead\\" though it did sound alot like the Beatles.The only thing i skip on this album is We will rock you and We are the champions because they are way overused, which unfortunatly ruins two very nice songs. I hate people who think they know the music of Queen just because they have heard these dreadfully overused songs. :( grrrrr.... I suppose I like \\"Spread you Wings\\", but i really am not a fan of \\"get down make love.\\" I wish it had more of a tune because the lyrics are raunchy and fun. I adore \\"Its late.\\" I really suggest you buy this album beacuse its a nice mix of songs and it does have a certain aura. I will love Queen forever. R.I.P. Freddie! I love you!!
0316666343|3.0|Let's get one thing straight, I'm a writer, so I really dislike writing negative reviews of books, knowing how much thought and work goes into them.  This is probably why I give this a generous 3 stars instead of the 1 star it deserves.  The concept of a young girl named (of all things) Susie Salmon, writing from her own personal heaven was an immediate draw.  Alice Sebold's approach to the story is creative, usual and quirky.  \\"Lovely Bones\\" starts off well enough, the pace is good; the characters and setting are fleshed out well.  Of course, most any reader would be saddened by the quick death of the protagonist but then again, that is the author's choice.  What bothers me the most about \\"Lovely Bones\\" is that there is never a release from the initial sadness.  The outlook of \\"Lovely Bones\\" goes from bad to worse.  Many of the main characters slowly fall apart--the ones that do okay are minor.  Most disappointing is that even the \\"bad guy\\" just quietly slips away, in terms of the storyline, when at first he and avenging his actions was the major focus. I agree with other reviewers in terms of the ending--it is useless and nonsensical but I won't spoil this for those who want to read the book. I can say that I was left with the impression that Sebold herself just sort of slipped out of the story towards the end into the sunset, along with Mr. Harvey, the murderer, perhaps the story even depressed her.  After such a great premise and beginning, in the end \\"Lovely Bones\\" left me sad, cold and very disappointed.  I didn't see anything much that was lovely about \\"Lovely Bones.\\"
B00005JKES|3.0|I think some guy in jeans needs to worry less aboot Twin Peaks and more aboot his jeans...And yes, it's a great DVD and I would love to see season's 2 and 3 follow.
B000000NN1|3.0|I remember first hearing Vangelis' \\"Heaven & Hell\\" back in high school, and getting creeped out by the haunting Hell passages on the record and loving it. Having Jon Anderson as a guest vocalist only enhanced the record. A couple years ago I found this cd in a bargain bin at my local record store and picked it up. I still pull it out every now again (for some reason I really dig listening to this in the Fall season). It's a shame that music like this and artists like Rick Wakeman, Brian Eno and others, isn't still being made, instead the 80's & 90's came along, Prog-Rock gave way to New Age, you had Yanni and John Tesh take over the instrumental scene and water it down to elevator pap. It's a shame that music has to be pidgenholed into such confining catagories, and most folks are left unaware of all that is out there.
B00005QXXO|4.0|I'd give this 4.5 if I could because the length (or lack of) is made up for with the quality of the performances here. Every song on here is done incredibly. 'I Might Be Wrong' is played with more distortion and a lot faster so that's nice plus. There's a little intro to 'Everything In Its Right Place' which is interesting...it sounds like Thom is saying \\"Here comes the flood\\" but I'm not sure. Colin adds a bass riff to 'Everything...' which is just so good it made me wonder why it wasn't on the album version. 'Like Spinning Plates' is awesome, so is 'True Love Waits'. I don't know why everybody says 'Dollars & Cents' is such a disappointment, Phil does an excellent job on the drums of this song. 'The National Anthem' is great, of course, and Thom even tries to make up for the lack of horns by mimicking (or more accurately, panting) the sounds himself. 'Idioteque', in my opinion, has always been better live than on the album. There's so much more energy that isn't reached on the album version. Phil's drumming and the addition of the shaker makes it so much better. Finally, 'Morning Bell' is excellent with the energy of being live.<br /><br />There are no disappointments on this album except it being too short. Highly recommended.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|My brother recomended this film to me. At first I was trying to hate it just to piss him off. About five minutes into the film it got interesting. This film is one of a kind, it is kind of a romantic, horror, Drama, Sci-fi and comedy film altogether. The best part is the ending, everyone will have a different understanding of it. The movie is kind of slow and confusing until the last fifteen minutes where everything starts to make sense and then the movies gets really interesting.  After it is done you are left in shock trying understand what happened , was Donnie crazy?, was he giving a second chance by god to change fate? Was it the end of the world or the end of HIS world?I dont Know. All I know is that this movie is coming out in an extended version and i'm going to make sure I get it the first day.
B000244FDW|3.0|In this movie showing one of the most loved novels of all time Pride and Prejudice the storyline is good and so are the characters. The sound and color weren't fabulous though. I do like this movie but, I think it's a little outdated. For a newer version check out Pride and Prejudice (1996?) with Colin Firth. I highly reccomend that one.
B000023VR6|4.0|i have to give the devil his due. this is a good album. but tupac was right, dre is lazy and takes credit for a lot of stuff he doesn't do. notice that this album doesn't mention who writes the songs or the production of each song because dre would be exposed. i'm still trippin' off the fact the jay-z wrote the song still dre. what kind of crap is that? then dre had the nerve to say his next album detox(which now won't be released at all)got pushed back because he gave most of the beats to 50 cent for his album which makes no sense considering dre only did like 4 or 5 songs on that album. plus dre keeps getting sued for stealing different sound effects from various movies and such. dre is a fake and he will never get my respect but he shouldn't worry because he'll always have shady and x to the z to kiss hiss a$$.
B00009XITP|5.0|I haven't seen this in a while, but when I think about it I can still remember it quite well. <br />I missed out in seeing this movie at the cinemas, so of course I got it out on DVD for 3 Days.  I really enjoyed watching it - even despite the bad characters of the story - because it was funny and had a lot of great location shots of England/London and I LOVED the inside of the English \\"Palace Rooms\\".  Although, this movie doesn't explain much about the British and I can't really understand why the British people don't seem to express their emotions and feelings the way we do.  <br />After I finished watching it, my parents watched it  and they really liked it too.  One of the things that really surprised me and especially pleased my Dad was the Special Guest Appearances by the Queen of England, Prince Charles and his sons  (we got a close-up of his face). <br />The Special Features on this DVD are 2 documents which can be considered 'making of' features as they play a big part in the movie and have scenes from the movie - they talk about \\"the costumes and clothes of the characters\\" and \\"the importance of manners\\", which can be quite handy in some circumstances of meeting such people (like your girlfriend's dad or making food, etc).  I think there's the Theatrical Trailer, but I don't remember exactly.  BUT, I DO REMEMBER A HIDDEN SPECIAL FEATURE:  If you click on the head of the Throne which Amanda Byrnes sits on (I believe in the 'Special Features Menu'), you get to see 2 takes on an audition for the Princess twins Peach and Pear. <br />This Movie and DVD is really good, and if you, your parents or anybody else you know likes England, Amanda Byrnes, the Queen of England and Prince Charles, then I'm sure this will certainly be enjoyable.
B00005BL2A|1.0|COMPLETELY lacking of the wonderful melodies, lyrics and hooks of most of DM's work. I can only hope their next album is better.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is a pathetic movie with pathetic characters for pathetic moviegoers.  If you enjoyed this movie, you must have a sorry life.
B00028HBKM|2.0|As so many other people on this review page have done by writing their Christian histories, I will do the same. I was born an Ukrainian Catholic (for those who don't know there are 13 branches of Catholisicsm), as a child I seldom went to church until my First Communion when I started going more often. Since then I drifted away from faith and the church once more.  <br />I always asked myself whether I believe in God and if so why. For if I do believe in God but because I fear him then that it is not faith but I must love God and aspire to be as close to God in order to acheive true faith. <br />Now the movie kicks in. And if it were not for some major qualms I had with this movie and its underlying philosophy I would rate it much higher. <br />The first main problem I have with this film is that it teaches us nothing about the method to get into Heaven. As Christians we must aspire to the perfection of Jesus Christ. We must try to live our lives without sin and try our best to fend off the cruel impish demons of temptation. We must reject the devil at every door. The beginning of this movie shows us some of this principle, it ends soon afterwards. Then we start seeing Jesus getting beaten and tormented. How am I to come closer to God by watching a snuff film? Am I to emulate Jesus' death and try to get executed or am I to become a sado-masochist? Perhaps the Passion was the most important part of Jesus' life. I don't know. What I do know is that Jesus taught some of the most interesting and radical things the world ever heard and unlike everyone else he practiced them.  <br />The words of Jesus could inspire people of every nationality and of every religion however the death of Jesus however cannot have the same effect. We all knew how Jesus died and though we could not picture it so vividly knew why he died. I wonder if Mel Gibson understood why Jesus died. However what does the death of Jesus mean if we cannot open those Pearly Gates? Perhaps all of those peoplewho saw The Passion will go to church each day now. Will that get them into those Pearly Gates, I THINK NOT. Being a Christian is a much deeper feeling. Suppose we did not know how Jesus died, would we still be good Christians?  <br />These are my values and my opinions are they God's opinion's? Maybe not, but don't be too sure that your opinions are one with God's either.  <br />The movie was visually stunning, everything from the death to the demons looked fantastic and realistic. But ask yourself why you believe in God and why you want to go to Heaven before you disagree. Do you sympathize with an actor that played Jesus or do you truly love God and want to be eternally united with him. <br />The movie was not anti-semetic. Somebody had to kill Jesus. If they didn't let the Romans do it then somebody else would have to have. That was God's will. <br />Don't judge lest you be judged yourself (yeah that is a paraphrase but does it matter) Don't vote against this before you ponder this. I may be right about something. <br />Thanks a lot~God Bless you all.
0553277472|3.0|...it all depends on what you wanted out of it.  The book is merely a reflection of yourself.  OK, I'm done with my Buddhist monk take on it.  Does it contain a lot of ideas that are fun to think about?  Yes--but so did Philosophy 101, and I don't think there's anything in here that wasn't covered there.  Phil. 101 also had the advantage of being narrated by a cute TA, not a guy whose mental illness makes him think he is brilliant, unique, tragically misunderstood, and that others are only worth listening to when they are feeding his insatiable ego.  Now, if you look at it as a peek inside the mind of a schizophrenic, it's interesting on that level.  Having grown up with one, it was interesting to see the patterns (just like no one who believes in reincarnation says they were a peasant in a former life--no, they were all Cleopatra--no schizophrenic is just mentally ill, they're all wildly brilliant and misunderstood because the whole rest of the world is too stupid to understand them...ask them, they'll tell you).  So if you're looking for deep, unique philosophy, read somebody off the Phil. 101 reading list--but if you think philosophy from the inside of the head of someone who is mentally ill and in complete denial might be interesting, give this one a shot.
B000025XX0|5.0|Compared to Greatest Hits I, this album's sales were disappointing, but the album is much better. Although none of the songs can measure up to 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (no songs can), the overall quality is much better. 'Innuendo', 'Radio Ga Ga', 'A Kind of Magic' and 'Under Pressure' are the best songs. <br />This album is far superior to its American counterpart, Classic Queen. This album is actually an album of Queen's hits, not half hits, half random songs. <br />Of course, this goes great with the UK Greatest Hits (with the US one, you don't get Bohemian Rhapsody).
B00003CXHJ|1.0|This is the sort of thing Hollywood would have released in 1942 if they could have made it then. An out and out propaganda film, with good guys vs. bad guys, and the bad guys are irredemably evil and the good guys, despite a few flaws, are, well, good. <br /> <br />The U-boat itself is pretty good, mind you. It's just a shame it couldn't have been used in a better movie. One, perhaps, with some vague connection to reality. For the most part, German sailors were committed nationalists, but not usually ardent Nazis, and would be just as appalled as any sailor by the idea of shooting up lifeboats. (It happened once, true, but that was the only time.)  <br /> <br />Other problems? Officers might drop in briefly at an enlisted men's party, but they'd never hold joint social events. Submerged submarines couldn't shoot at each other until sometime in the 1950's. No German destroyer ever operated off the Atlantic coast of the United States, or even in the mid Atlantic. And, while submarines all operate on roughly the same principles, the way they do it is sufficiently different from one country to another that an American crew trying to dive a German boat would almost certainly be killed in the process. <br /> <br />Mind you, if you just want a lot of noise and special effects, and enjoy watching stuff blow up and don't care a whit about history or reality, this might just be enjoyable.
0316666343|5.0|I read this book in just 3 nights. I love a book that grabs me right from the first page, and this is one of those books. The language is realistic and age appropriate for the characters. The author also does well to express the emotions of the characters.    The story is narrated, from heaven, by a girl (Susie) who was murdered. I like that the story shows how profoundly an unexpected death can affect those close to the one who died. Susie's unsolved murder ravages and rips apart her family. Each member sinking into their own world, their own way(s) of grieving. At the same time the family, both literally and figuratively, separates from each other, they are simultaneously bound by their unspoken heartache.    The characters are strong in their own unique ways, and even as life is falling apart, they find a way to deal with it...sometimes without thinking.    I felt sad, happy, confused, angry, sympathetic, frustrated, hopeful, and disgusted, all at different points in the story. I even shed a few tears, which speaks to the power of the author's ability to bring words to life. To create a fictitious story that could just as easily be non-fiction.    I found myself actually excited to get home and finish this book. It is not one that I could put down and come back to. If I didn't have to work, I would have read this book all at once.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Not everything David Lynch does has to be driven by an inner meaning.  There are several films that arrest the audience with a macabre web of suspense, and end in that one hair-raising \\"Aha!\\" moment. On and of the spectrum of classics such as Memento and The Sixth Sense where the director had clearly thought through the consistency of the plot.  Then there are others bodies of confusion such as Swimming Pool and Mulholland Drive where the directors had either been unable or unwilling to keep everything consistent.  These movies do not add up not because they are brainchildren of beings with a higher level of intellect, but rather because directors like David Lynch are so focused on confusing the audience and living up to their reputation that they pay little attention to making the ends meet. It is sad to see Mulholland Drive being compared to Memento, a movie that leaves no loopholes, and yet lives up to being a \\"Moebius Strip\\" and a real brain-teaser. Mulholland Drive is the result of a film major flunking a logic class. <br /> <br />To add insult to injury, the DVD is not divided into chapters! (I guess Lynch didn't want you to take a sneak preview on the finale! (\\"Silencio\\"!)
B00005YW4H|1.0|Hurl tomatoes at this rotten loser, just do anything to make her stop singing! This is pure music for octogenarians who remember the jazz age and actually want to relive it. I don't understand who would want to relive music like that, when we have three decades of great pop, rock, and rap. I can't belive she won 8 Grammies. That shows what the world has come to. I hate Nora Jones.
0385336810|5.0|This book was so good that I couldn't put it down! I read it within 12 hours!!! I found this book to be really funny, and the plot was well-developed. The ending is a little abrupt, but all-in-all it is a GREAT chicklit read!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Sweet, mild-mannered, mildly retarded Forrest Gump goes through life innocently inserting himself into pivotal events in America's history. The soundtrack alone, musical hits readily identified with the time period they play against, would make this movie worth seeing. Forrest makes us all wonder if, however low his IQ, he just might not be wiser than all of us.
B000083E79|4.0|It's like a musical metamorphosis. I never EVER thought that I would listen to an artist called CHER. I don't listen to her kind of music until now. <br /> <br />I grabbed the Very Best Of Cher and decided to give it a spin and gosh was I surprised! This lady has some incredible kick-ass songs. The only song I knew of her before this is the chart-topper 'Believe'. Her past hits are less of a `techno' sound that she's incorporated in her most recent album. I recently watched her Farewell Tour concert and man, I was blown away. Apart from her ridiculous costumes, this woman can sing. <br /> <br />However after listening for a coupla times, I conclude that I don't dig her old material (the really old one). Songs like `All I Really Want To Do',  `Half-Breed' & `Dark Lady' are really old and I don't like them. The ones with Sonny are bad too. There are 11 amazing songs and I would like to concentrate on this songs. <br /> <br />The Best 11: maximum score - 10 <br /> <br />1. Believe (8.5 - A dance song, very uplifting and catchy) <br />2. If I Could Turn Back Time (9 - Diane Warren penned. Very nice) <br />3. Heart Of Stone (8 - Takes some time before you'll like this. Hot song) <br />4. Just Like Jesse James (9.5 - This is hot! Kick-ass song) <br />5. After All (7.5 - The ONLY ballad. Beautiful) <br />6. I Found Someone (9.5 - Love the chorus. She can stretch those lungs.) <br />7. Strong Enough (10 - Perfect. I really love this. Kinda like Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive) <br />8. All Or Nothing (9.9 - Very damn catchy. Makes you wanna dance) <br />9. Song For The Lonely (9 - Again very techno-tinged. It's dancey. <br />10. The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss) (8.5 - Sounds real old but its cool) <br />11. Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) (10 - The best song! Very rockish. Love the background vocals + electric guitar) <br /> <br />I suggest that if you never listen to her before, buy this one. You'll be surprised. Even I, and R&B listener actually listens to her music. Its very dancefloor ready and some are sing-along types. I wanted to give it a 4.5 overall but you know how it works. Real hot! Dig this! <br />
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Only death could stop Ray Charles from making music alone or with his friends.  Working up to just months before his recent death, he again demonstrates why he was a musical genius.  There isn't a bad track on this album, but I have some favorites.  Ray and Elton John singing \\"Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word\\" is just magic.  And, there were tears in my eyes when I heard Ray & Willie Nelson sing \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\".  I highly recommend this collection of duets to every Ray Charles fan and even if you aren't a fan, you will be once you hear this one.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|It took an Aussie band to remind us Americans just how horrible our music scene is. Straight-ahead, in-yer-face, blues-based... it's refreshing, and very well done. A nice cross between the late 60's Beatles and AC/DC. Gobs of hooks, rudimentary chords, borderline-dumb lyrics but so profoundly cool. Definitely one of the top albums of the year, for, if nothing else, it shows us how pure and simple rock music can be.
B000002MP2|4.0|This album always makes me miss the fun-filled days of my teenager-hood. I remember the fun times I had driving around in my 66 Mustang... Well, anyway, I love this album! Even though there are a couple a filler tracks, it still reminds me of fun days, and so I often put it into rotation. That's saying a lot, cause I have over 1000 CD's! This is what started the pop/punk movement, which i love.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Okay, what is the prob? I have the VHS set and will get the DVD when available. Lucas's updating is eagerly anticipated. Who cannot love new scenes? Haveing been there and done it...waiting in line 6-8 hrs for the first showing, having brought and shared our picnic food with others in line (how they loved that fried chicken and brownies) what is wrong with updating the movies technologically and with added scenes?? Tying together the 6 movies is logical. Consistancy can be kewl. Too bad the original series of 9 won't be realized,  Anyhow, if you don't want to loose sight of the original, then keep your VHS versions!! I will. But relax and just enjoy. My Popcorn and ice cream bonbons are ready!
0385507755|4.0|This is by far the best book I've read this year. One comment I would like to make is actually a point that keeps being brought up in other reviews. That is, great book, but the main character is such an angry, abusive, immature jerk. A lot of readers find that both his bravado and the admiration he draws from patients and staff alike simply doesn't ring true. I completely disagree. As a point of fact, addiction arrests the addict's/alcoholics emotional development, so in essence, that person becomes pretty much stalled at the age their addiction began. Frey's mixture of immaturity, rage, and vulnerability very much captures what a mixed up, angry 10 year old is like, the age Frey's addiction began. I'm not saying the man might not be exaggerating a little (hey, he may still be catching up to his chronological age!), and the whole dental office drama stretched credibility. I just think it's important to note this common aspect of maturity/addition and keep it in mind while reading. IMO, I don't think Frey is that far off the mark.
B00004XMS0|3.0|First of all I would like to point out the striking similarites between the Superman series and the Batman series, as it strengthens my following arguement. Both Superman and Batman had exceptional first movies, decent sequels (Though those penguins with missles on their backs really had my eyes rolling), and then two stupendously horrendous follow-ups. The third and fourth installments of both franchises are not even worth watching. I mean, Superman pitted against a supercomputer created by Richard Pryor, an intelligence-draining machine crafted by the Riddler, a \\"Boy\\" wonder who's almost 30, Superman splitting in two and fighting himself, three different actors playing the same role, people turning into plants, batgirl, completely inventing a new villian (Nuclear Man... ugh) rather than borrowing from the tried and true pantheon of the comic, nipples on a superhero's suit... the list of bad ideas goes on and on. <br />This leads me to my point. The studio (Warner Bros.) should have stopped after the second sequel for both franchises, but noooo, there was money to still be made, and even though the material was wearing thin they went ahead and made atrocious films that stole the glory from the originals. They were weakly written and weakly directed, mostly because it didn't matter anymore. The studio knew people would go to see the films based on the previous successes, and that my friends is the greatest attrocity inflicted upon the movie-viewing public. They think we are stupid. Superman III, Superman IV, Batman Forever, and Batman and Robin should have never been made. <br />Now, should you buy this collection or the Superman collection. That's up to you. You don't get any extras with this set and the Superman set's extras really aren't that great. You can purchase the movies separately. Batman, Batman Returns, Superman: The Movie, and Superman II are all great films. That is definately the route to go in my opinion.
B00005JN7O|5.0|I recently saw a preview for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, and it was one of the most amazing things that I have ever seen in my life! Jude Law stars in the film, along with Angelonie Jolie. The plot seems thin, but there are airplanes, birds, hot-air balloons, WWII fighters, futuristic weapons, and much more! The cinematography is what really caught my eye, with a dreamy, comic-book like fantastic world approach. The visuals are spot-on with incredible CGI and flight sequences that put Star Wars to shame. Comic book or aviation fanatics, this could be what you have been waiting for. With this movie being the one I have been most excited about since Big Fish, which was incredible, this looks like it will break Hollywood ground forever. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is about to land! Will it soar to glory or be shot down to another Hollywood misery? We'll have to wait and see!
B000069AUI|1.0|This is the worst album i ever owned. Period. How could these lame-o Brits call this music? it's not pop, it's certainly not rock, than what is it? It's just boring, melancholy, depressing, trash music that only airheads would like. Why is music like this popular? Come on, there is better music, why listen to this???
0743243315|2.0|Allow me to preface this review by stating that I really wanted to enjoy BRICK LANE; I have a weakness for literature from the Indian subcontinent and always enjoy the colorful quirky characters, but this book never delivered any enjoyment. The beginning was slow and Monica Ali's prose was disturbingly choppy and uneven. About halfway through I was ready to hang my hat and call it quits as the plot became more and more ridiculous. The only redeeming quality was the character of Chanu, the patriarch of the family, who was beautifully created and realistic. I wish that Ali would have focused more on him and put the wife to the background. Her letters from her sister in Dhaka were painful to read and made my eyes ache trying to figure them out. What literary purpose was it to write letters in that style? To put it mildly I was very disappointed with BRICK LANE and wonder how it even achieved the esteem of being on the 2003 Booker Shortlist? There are much better books in this genre that should receive more attention. Not recommended.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|This is the album that changed music indefinitely!!! From the first note and the first lyric, to the last note and the last lyric, this album dropped the jaws of some of the greatest musicians, folk and rock, in the world. If \\"Bring It All Back Home\\" impressed the Beatles so much that they came knocking on Dylan's door on more than one occasion and had Mick Jagger longing to play on a Dylan album for most of his career, especially \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" then \\"Highway 61\\" had them falling to their knees. Not only is this album a 5 star album, it should be placed above any review at this point in it's history. If only we had this quality of material coming out of our music industry today.     What the current hybrid offers that the original release does not is the clarity of each instrument, including Dylan's voice. The songs on the album take on a new dynamic, some songs building in intensity as with \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" an intensity that is not fully realized on the original release.  If you don't have this album, get it. It's influence on music history upped the level of expectation for all music to come in it's genre and other genre's as well. Columbia did an excellent job on the hybrid version.    At some point in time, whether he wants it or not, Dylan will get his due and be recognized as one of the greatest artists this world has witnessed.
1892005034|2.0|I didn't really like this book.  Although the skills described are useful, the author's style is incredibly condescending and arrogant.  I felt like a dumb child at the back of the class all the way through.  And some of the examples given of \\"real life\\" situations are ridiculous.  As if you would ever, in a group of people at a function, tell the person talking that you find what they are saying to be unnecessary and uninteresting.  Well, not if you don't mind not having any friends or business contacts.  Honesty should only go so far in my opinion. I'm sure there are many other better books if you want to learn some good communication skills.
0694526088|4.0|Good audio quality.  <br />Easy to listen to while driving in the car.  <br />Some phrases are overused and/or overemphasized. <br />Great material.  <br /> <br />I have listened to this several times, to remind me of what I should be shooting for in the daily grind at work.  <br />
B00005RDSM|5.0|\\"SHANGHAI WENDY?\\", the pirates reply.!!!  That's what I say!!!<br /><br />Captain Hook is, his fellow pirates say, \\"the world's most famous crook\\"!<br /><br />If it weren't for Peter Pan, I would not have a name!  I'm most grateful to be named after Wendy Darling, a most gracious heroine and foster mother to the Lost Boys of Never, Never Land.  I'm so glad too that Disney left out the ending where Wendy grows up after all, gets married, and meets Peter Pan after so many years of separation.  What a rotten ending, I've always thought, so glad this version ended differently.<br /><br />There's not really a moral to the story, just a fanciful adventure/children's story of innocent kids battling Captain Hook and his cohorts.  Another Disney classic!<br /><br />\\"Say your prayers, Hook!!!\\", Peter Pan replies when he saves the day!
B000089CJI|5.0|this album is such a great coloboration between many great indie artists. I bought this CD after hearing many songs in A LOT of different places. Being a HUGE fan of Death Cab, and Jenny Lewis from Rilo Kiley (yep...the red headed girl from Troop Beverly Hills) it only seemed natural that I pick up this CD. I was amazed from track one to ten. The electronic elements compliment such an obvious pain in Gibbards voice, and the two girls who he works with can only compliment. The sweetly heartbreaking Such Great Heights is the true stand out of this album. I was sitting in my car just bawling. Brand New Colony is another AMAZING song. While it sounds like the super mario brothers theme playing, IT IS NOT!! It is very subtle and very electronic, but works. Despite what other people have written here, its not...they didnt sample that, nor does it really sound anything like it. This project is one that I hope they continue to work on. They are all such amazing musicians and I only wish that everyone could hear what good music really is. Get rid of cookie cutter rock bands (Alter Bridge, The Calling, Bowling For Soup) and bring back GOOD alternative music! If you ask me Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello are doing their part, so why cant you do yours...go out and buy this CD.
B00007E8V4|2.0|I have bought all of SOAD's cds, and this just doesnt do it for me. I didnt realy like their first, but I like Toxicity. This cd is basically tracks they left off of Toxicity, and I think they left them off for a reason. These tracks are just too pop and soft, and not enough metal. They come across weird, and boring.
B000001FKY|5.0|One of the most sold rock albums in history released in 1987 and kept the top positions for a couple years more, is one of my top favorites of all time as well. If you have already tasted similarly styled recent great albums such as Euphoria and X you will see why the fans are not satisfied with even with recent gems. It's truly incredible. This album retains hard-edge while venturing into power pop crispness. Few of the rockers have ever done this in such lunatic manner. Even Jim Peterik of Survivor might have felt beaten.<br /><br />Album starts with WOMEN with amazingly heavy-riffed intro and moves ahead into euphoric chorus. ROCKET, ANIMAL, POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME are such incrdible combination of tightness and catchiness which they failed to achieve well in recent X. GODS OF WAR is dyanamic and emblematic of the album conception HYSTERIA. and DON'T SHOOT SHOTGUN follows quite smoothly. Tension never fades until the last track LOVE AND AFFECTION.<br /><br />Hysteria is a landmark melodic rock album and one of the last glory days of the genre. This boosted the rock taste into much aggressive and deadly direction which culminated into METALLICA'S Black Album.<br /><br />Essential album for rock biters.
B0002I831S|5.0|Well, when I first saw the details about this set, I was really sceptical. I was not crazy about how the packaging looked and I was not happy with the fact that the episodes are in original broadcast order and not production order. However, after receiving my copy, I was so impressed with the packaging that all other issues I have with the original series box set releases are out the window. I am really pleased and impressed with the design of the packaging now that I can see it and feel it. It's very innovative.If you are a fan, this is a must have.
B0002CTSVS|5.0|Passion of the Christ is one of the best films to grace the big screen.  No far-fetched stories, just a man and his destiny.<br />The music score is second to none, the acting is worthy of praise and the directing is something to be proud of.<br />Never has the story of our Lord Jesus Christ been so well portrayed, so well shown.<br />ABOUT DVD:  The Passion of The Christ is all that is needed to make this DVD a hit.  However, it contains no &quot;chapter listings' no printed material what-so-ever.  No special features is included, not even the trailers.  Quite a shame really.  Thanks for including both the English and French Subtitles!<br />A MUST BUY DVD FOR EVERYONE!
B00004Z459|2.0|I mostly bought this cd for the song \\"Crawling\\", and it is basically the only good one on here. Excpet for maybe \\"One Step Closer\\". I dont like rap, which this has a lot of.
B00005JMX6|3.0|The Girl Next Door  is a big Risky Business rip-off but it's still no way as bad as critics have made it out to be. It takes the Risky Business script and edits it. The hooker role is now a pornstar and the pimp role is now a porn producer. However  Elisha Cuthbert (24, Old School) and Timothy Olyphant (Scream 2, Go!) play them very well, especially Olyphant. He takes the part and does something with it. He makes his character scary and pretty damn funny as well. He makes this his move the second he appears on screen. Since Go! I always saw him as one of the most talented under used actors and he proves that he is here. He's why I mostly don't think the movie is bad. Him and  Elisha Cuthbert make it worth watching and almost make you forget it's not a fresh idea. I think Emile Hirsch got too much abuse in the reviews. He's no Tom Cruise but he still shines in the role and does try hard. So in other words the cast makes this one worth watching. It's still a pretty funny movie and does manage to be a little heart warming for a teen comedy with pornstars and porn producers.
1400034779|5.0|I selected this book essentially at random. I knew nothing about Alexander McCall Smith. I was pleasantly surprised to be totally delighted with the book. The characters are believable and sympathetic, the plot is engaging, and the sense that we are being told the truth about place and culture is remarkable. When I read in last week's Economist magazine about Smith and how the series has sold over 5 million copies, I was not surprised. He deserves the success for giving us such a positive, rewarding reading experience.
B00005JMXX|4.0|The Day After Tomorrow is, in my opinion, a very well-made movie.  The effects are excellent, especially the storm scenes in Los Angeles and the quick-freeze scenes spread throughout the last half. <br /> <br />But, in all seriousness, the plot is as close to impossible as can be.  The idea that Global Warming alone could cause an ice age is nearly laughable.  I know, I know, it's only a movie, but it still gets people to believe that Global Warming is actually the most dangerous thing to happen since the Manson Family, when in truth it's simply a natural phase in the Earth's environmental cycle. <br /> <br />A gradual increase in the Earth's temperature -- regardless how long it lasts -- will not cause an ice age.  Surprisingly enough, ice age conditions can ONLY be created through intense HEAT, which evaporates a good portion of the oceans and lakes, and saturates the atmosphere with moisture (such as like what would happen should a large comet or asteroid strike the planet).  Then the sudden cessation of that heat causes a rapid cooling-off period, which would, in effect, flash-freeze the northern and southern regions of the Earth (again, such as the results should a global debris envelope form following a comet/asteroid collision).  I am a firm believer that the majority of scientists have their ice age theories completely wrong. <br /> <br />Anyway, enough of my 'soap-box' sermonizing.  This is a very good movie, as long as you don't take the plot too seriously, as a few reviewers have done...
6300267997|5.0|I am reading all these awful reviews for \\"A Star is Born\\" and I can't believe that one would go so far to deconstruct a movie this much. It wasn't meant to be a serious charecter analogy, it was meant to be a love story, end of story. The writer and director needed to develop the chearecters enough for the viewer to like and feel like they knew them. Personally, that movie did all of that. I loved every minute of it. If I wanted a complicated movie, this isn't one I would watch, but I watch the charecters because they are fun, likable, and while there are many movies that have done that over the years, this has remained my favorite because the actors were believable, the music was great and has stayed with me, soundtrack is key in any movie, and with Barbra's jumpsuit's. it is like slipping into a more pleasant past. I check every couple of months for it to come out on DVD.
B0001VWP8I|4.0|Now we have the third album, and it doesn't dissapoint. Same big and full of energy songs as displayed in SEASONS CHANGE and can go into soft ballads, HEAVY ON MY HEART. to just rock with lyrics who just ask for what she wants I DO. SICK AND TIRED is by far the best song she has ever made, thus being the best on the album, (the african guy in the background sounds excellent) and one of the best lyrics. She has gone through hardship of bnreast cancer and depression when writing for this album, and her emotions are shown throughout the whole album. LEFT OUTSIDE ALONE was dissapointing at first but it grew heavily on me. SEXY SINGLE sounds a bit off the record but then you have the ultra-relative PRETTY LITTLE DUM DUM. TIME is probablly the second best on the album, pure excellence. Lyrics, excellent and music excellent. For any pop or rock fan. In a word: Edgy.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Don't believe the poor reviews. Don't believe me when I say I loved it. Watch it for yourself, give it a chance to impress you. Watch it once for the movie itself and the characters, then watch it again for the beauty. The photography is wonderful; the beauty of Japan, and the street life of a different culture is very interesting to witness. I loved the music choices for the scenes. Everything fits together perfectly. This movie is not a 'cut and dried' love affair. It is an affair of the heart and mind. That is what people don't \\"get\\"!<br /><br />You don't have to see T & A to have an interesting movie!<br /><br />I would watch this a thousand times just to see the last 10 minutes of the heartfelt ending. (I would love to know what he whispered in her ear.) These characters love each other in an \\"outside the box\\" way, and you know when they part at the end they are never going to see each other again...no, this not a typical movie, not a typical love story, so it is not for a typical person.<br /><br />This is an open-minded story. So keep one and decide for yourself.
B00005JLR8|5.0|What a remarkable movie experience this is. <br /> <br />The tale of an Irish immigrant family not only following a dream, but running from the nightmare of the loss of a child, is inspiring, thought-provoking, angering, and touching.  It gives a raw, no-holds barred look at the poverty our society tries to ignore, and the hope and spirit of accomplishment that our country was founded on.  And it's protrayal of the dark, less glossy side of the American dream isn't displayed in a 'beating you over the head' type, or milking for sympathy, but just what people will do to live 'In America.' <br /> <br />Performances are exceptional, particularly with Dimon Hunsue and Samantha Morton.  But, if you want an honest look at the American Dream and what would make one want to pursue it, and gain a new appreciate for the country we live in, this film is for you.
B0002GTWYW|1.0|Remixed and remastered? before listening to this cd I anticipated that this was not only remastered for better sound quality but also remixed for a new verison of biggies ready to die cd (a must buy for any true hip hop fan) but after listening to this cd i came to find that it was the same cd as the orignal except a few bonus tracks (literally 3 new tracks). Don't waste my time. If you already own ready to die , don't waste the money for this sad excuse of a \\"remix\\" cd...If you are a true BIG fan these tracks are ones you've already heard and not worth 14 more dollars...shame on you bad boy records...BIG just rolled over in his grave...
0312263120|5.0|I used to think that government employees should be pitied and that computers only made sense to computer experts. Thanks to Dan Brown, I can safely say that the government (well, NSA) employees in this book don't have my pity, since they go through too much trouble trying to hunt down a missing code to disarm an invincible computer algorithm. But the fun doesn't stop there: Someone in the background is playing dirty, and the heroes might not win this battle after all.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Oh what can I say about the Passionless \\"Passion\\".  Well, it's beautifully shot and flawlessly acted (except for the horrible priests and let's not forget Jesus himself, playing a slab of meat to be shredded is not acting). I personally loved the Devil in the movie.  But other than that... it was so damned blah.  Jesus was a fascinating man. His teachings were wonderful and important.  But that doesn't matter... Hell, none of that matters.  Why should it?  Watching him being beaten to death is just so much more manipulative.  Let's get everybody all whipped up into a frenzy by graphically showing them the death of their savior.  Hey that's a great idea!  Faith is never more fervent then when it comes from guilt or fear.  And let's not forget the cash... loads and loads of cash for Mel.  People, you can believe what you want, but the bottom line is cash, cash, cash and more cash.  I wonder how much he tithed for church... as much as possible; it's a great tax right off.
0060977493|2.0|I had to read this book for school, which might be part of the reason I found it to be so bad. Usually, I'll read anything and most of the time won't have any complaints about it. I don't understand how this book won the Booker Prize. Many praise the language Ms. Roy uses; I found it to be annoying. She writes in sentence fragments. This book is a frame story and the reader already knows what will happen. The problem is that she doesn't give the reader reason to care about the characters enough to read on so I spent most of the book struggling to get through chapter after chapter of pointless description and local color. In retrospect, there wasn't really much activity in this book, just a lot of rambling and multiple descriptions of characters' pasts that got repetative quite quickly.  I gave this book two stars instead of one because I believe that, in the future, Ms. Roy may produce something less devoid of emotion. But perhaps I am being optimistic.

0671027387|5.0|Deception Point is a real thriller, armed with Brown's inimitable style. It starts off cryptically, and manages to keep you guessing as to who really is up to what and why, even though half of the how is handed to you as you read! It's the mark of a good book when you have enough answers to make a short list of suspects, but this novel goes a step further by making sure that your list is occupied by characters you can't seem to choose between! Pick this up and don't delay!
6305508550|3.0|In the land of cubicles and Dilbert comics, this movie is quoted entirely too much. Workers at every level in the organization seemed entirely too enamored of this movie, but I knew I had to see it when even the managers started trading one-liners. Many viewings and several years later, I can begin to appreciate its charms, though I can't bring myself to say that it is a great movie. It is not even a good movie, and yet, undoubtedly, it is a classic. Office workers of all stripes must see this movie, if only to be able to decipher what everyone else is talking about.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt

0385510438|4.0|Welcome to Mayberry... err, Clanton, Mississippi, an old southern town full of charm and interesting characters.  The central character is a young man who takes over the town newspaper, and tells a story of how his life in the town evolves over a period of 9 years, centered about the brutal murder of a young woman and the ensuing trial, etc.  The story rambles, and never really becomes a gripping suspense.  But it is a pleasant read - the sort of book that is good for your blood pressure.  The ending is somewhat predictable.  Grisham writes with class, as usual.
B00005A0V0|5.0|Utterly amazing!!!  <br /> <br />Even if you dont like some of the tracks on this album, you have to honour, stand speechless, faint or even die when you hear the piano solo on the title track Land Of Grey And Pink. It is THAT good. It creeps in, floats, shimmers, bows and gracefully tiptoes out giving way to a distorted organ. And you have to love the brrrrlllluurrrbbbbrrrrrbbbbb (the noice you make to babies) lead vocal toward the end. <br /> <br />Golf Girl is of similar structure (those power acoustic chords are amazing) without the atmosphere - more of a comic song. <br /> <br />I have the big double best of Caravan CD and recently got this (just for Land Of Grey And Pink as it happens) and cannot stop playing it. <br /> <br />FANTASTIC!!!
B00005JL3A|2.0|Based on a computer game, Resident Evil actually looks like a computer game:  the characters run around in a maze-like environment, shooting zombies and mutants while a standard video game soundtrack hums in the background.  There isn't much of a plot, just enough to establish why the zombies are there.  Admittedly, with two characters with amnesia and a possible traitor in the group, there is room for a plot twist, but any revelations are mere diversions from the killings. <br /> <br />With more than a few references to other zombie flicks, particularly Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Resident Evil doesn't offer anything very new.  The action is passable but nothing special; essentially, anything this movie does, some other movie has already done better.  On the other hand, there is nothing truly bad in this movie: it merely lacks anything good.  <br />
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|It would be nice to see this ranking hold up in Billboard as well.  The range of duet partners seems compelling enough to interest the \\"casual shopper\\" so there's hope. <br /> <br />To me, the highlights are the songs with Norah Jones, James Taylor, Elton John, Bonnie Raitt, B.B. King, and Miss Gladys Knight.  I also like the vocals, though not the overdone arrangement, on \\"Over the Rainbow\\" with the underappreciated Johnny Mathis, who sounds as good as ever. <br /> <br />On a record with the potential to reignite genuine excitement for good songs and good music, I won't complain (much) about Natalie Cole's surprisingly glib and un-sultry approach to \\"Fever\\" or how depressing \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\" is no matter who tries it.  I hope the latter was chosen because Ray and Willie Nelson really liked it, rather than for the pathos all involved had to know would inevitably resonate now that Mr. Charles has passed on. <br /> <br />Unlike some others, I don't feel Ray's vocals sound \\"sickly\\" or weak on this CD.  Even though we now know he was ailing during these sessions, it sounds to me as if he overcame it to produce one last, fine recording.
B00005QK3B|5.0|Este es una album de antologia para quienes gustamos del Rock Progresivo en su maxima expresion, que aunque muy criticados por la supuesta analogia a Genesis, esta claro lo que Marillion ha plasmado en este disco y que ha quedado para futuras generaciones, la pasion vocal de Fish mezclada con habilidad a las guitarras de Steve y al mistico teclado de Mark suenan claros ante el fondeo aportado por Ian a la bateria y Pete al bajo. Rolas continuas bajo un concepto lirico-musical que hoy en nuestros dias ya no se escucha. Lo catalogo como un disco de Antologia ochentera. Si nunca los has escuchado, este es el CD correcto para iniciarte. Saludos. Mork
B000286RKW|5.0|Brutal, stylish, hypnotic and addictive, \\"GoodFellas\\" remains Martin Scorsese's greatest film. Director Richard Linklater, a major fan, dismisses those who instead champion \\"Raging Bull.\\" With \\"GoodFellas,\\" he says in the DVD extras, \\"You are in the hands of a master. Enjoy the ride.\\"<br /><br />\\"GoodFellas\\" anchors Warner's \\"Martin Scorsese Collection\\" of five films, including the gangster film's thematic predecessors \\"Mean Streets\\" and \\"Who's That Knocking at My Door?\\"<br /><br />The double-disc \\"GoodFellas\\" offers two worthy commentaries -- one with the actors and filmmakers; another with Henry Hill, the movie's real-life anti-hero, played with considerable verve by Ray Liotta.<br /><br />Hill shares the commentary with the lawman who turned him into a federal witness, but the semipenitent mobster does most of the talking. Hill is a great storyteller in the Italian street tradition -- it's fascinating watching the movie with him. The film \\"was all based on the rhythm of Henry Hill's language,\\" Scorsese says.<br /><br />The cast-and-filmmaker talk includes almost all of the key talent, whose comments are carefully placed and tightly edited. Some chapters are automatically bypassed during the commentary.<br /><br />\\"GoodFellas\\" fans love to cite some of the film's jaw-dropping scenes: Scorsese and editor Thelma Schoonmaker dissect three of the best.<br /><br />Disc 2 includes a quartet of freshly minted featurettes, but most of the action is in the commentaries.<br /><br />Audio and video are superb, blowing away the previous Warner DVD, which dates back to the format's Stone Age. Aspect ratio is 1:85.1, as shot.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Mel Gibson on my opinion was destined to do this inspirational life of Our Saviour & Lord Jesus Christ . We are the reason that he gave his life and he is the reason we live. Millions of people was touched watching this film that is why go out there and get it and spread the good news of the lord that revolves in Love and Respect for others. \\"GOD BLESS US ALL ALWAYS\\".
B00028HBKM|2.0|I watched this movie with an open mind as to the charges of anti-semitism made against it. I find these charges ridiculous. This movie makes no accusation against \\"the Jews\\" except for that which the stupidly literal-minded or the already inclined would read into it. Instead it portrays the abuses one should reasonably expect when religious and political leadership is too intermingled, and given the time and place, the intolerant religious fanatics in the movie happen to be Jews. I didn't like religious fanaticism before this movie, and this movie affirmed my distrust of it; my opinion of \\"the Jews\\" was unchanged.<br /><br />I also tried, as a non-believer, to allow the film to do what it could to win me over to Christianity. I find it offered me nothing at all. It gave me two hours of a man being tortured to death, unencumbered by context. Who is this? What did he do wrong? Who are those arrayed against him? What is the nature of the conflict? This film doesn't bother with these questions. Certainly the film provokes sympathy for the Jesus character and his mother, but without context, it generates nothing beyond sadness and pity. As I don't understand Aramaic or Latin, I was left to abet the grisly presentation with what I could gather from the visible spectacle and what I already knew about the story. My reading of this cinematic Rorschach inkblot showed religious fanatics combining forces with political opportunists to destroy an apparently guiltless man. What I already knew about the story had already failed to win me to Christian cosmology, so all this film did was supply a great deal of visual detail on aspects of the story that are better left vague.<br /><br />Sorry, fanatical Christians, but beating, whipping, and crucifixion doesn't prove the victim's divinity, and does nothing to establish the validity of his teachings; the Romans nailed a lot of people to boards, and none of them were gods. Theologically, Mel Gibson is preaching only to the converted here, and for everyone else, this is just a prurient representation of religiously- and politically-motivated cruelty. Whatever dark part of me that enjoys watching a man tortured to death is not, I would hope, a part of me that's close to any actual deity or true faith. It's difficult to imagine a less appealing piece of evangelism than The Passion of the Christ, but the spectacle of professed Christians heaping praise on it comes close.ed here, and for everyone else, this is just a prurient representation of religiously- and politically-motivated cruelty.

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Spanning from the ragtime big band tunes \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\" to the bluesy hits like \\"I can't stop loving you\\", Ray Charles proves himself a master of his craft. In his final album Genius loves company, Ray Charles collaborates with 12 of his favourite artistes to bring back some of his good ol' classics. The resultant album is poignant and liberating at the same time. Genius loves company shows how much more Ray Charles was capable of if not for his failing health. Though his last album is not his best to date, moments of classics abound. In the John Burk-produced track \\"Here We Go Again\\" (on 1967's Listen), songbird Norah Jones and Ray Charles attains sublime harmony. Diana Krall also graces \\"You Don't Know Me\\" with sultry delivery; Bonnie Raitt and Ray evokes new dimension to the country track \\"Do I ever cross your mind\\". The best tracks out of the album are probably the last three tracks. Glady Knights and Ray Charles reign supreme with the upbeat rendition of \\"Heaven help us all\\"; Johnny Mathis and a new arrangement revitalizes the timeless tune of \\"Over the Rainbow\\" and the live version of \\"Crazy love\\" with Van Morrison really shows Ray Charles at his peak as a musical genius of his times.
0393317552|5.0|Author Jared Diamond's &#34;Guns, Germs, and Steel&#34; lays a foundation for the understanding of &#62;13,000 years of human history throughout the world.<br /><br />Diamond claims that the thought of producing this treatise arose during a conversation with a local politician named &#34;Yali&#34; during a visit to New Guinea in 1972.  According to Diamond, Yali's question was (among others): &#34;Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?&#34;<br /><br />Diamond responded to Yali's question in the form of this well thought out text.  In it, the reader is treated to more than &#62;470 pages of a &#34;short history of everybody&#34; which sets out to answer one of several motivating questions of the book, that is, &#34;Why did history unfold differently on different continents?&#34;<br /><br />The reader will not be disappointed with this easy to read and understand book.  The reader will, no doubt, receive a high value ratio of historical insight provided to Dollar spent.  This book is a remarkable, well thought out writing that analyzes the basic workings of humankind's diverse cultural processes.  I rate this text at five stars.  Well done!
B00005JLR8|5.0|My reviews are often quite critical, which makes sense, because I am a critic. This film is very well done. I can't complain, and it is a film that everyone should like, at least the feminine half. I liked it too. It is a no tongue-in-check, old fashioned, straight-ahead, bone-meets-blood, slice of life. Djimon Hounsou is exceptional. This is solid, albeit emotional, entertainment.
0553579908|5.0|I don't know I just felt it was more focused than Game of Thrones.  It is also an essential book to read because if you skip this one and go to number three you will miss the most best part of the serise.   <br /> <br />I guess other than the good writting and the wonderful charecters(most of them and even than I can respect the ones I don't like)the reason I like this book so much is that everyone is preety much at the height of their power.   <br /> <br />With Robb King of the North and the Trident  <br />Tyrion in King's Landing practically running the place  <br />John Snow and the rest of the Night Watch going out to kick Wilding butt  <br />Even Theon Grayjoy manages to do something unexpected with kind of makes me like him in a pitying kind of way.   <br /> <br />Overall-Most of all don't forget Stannis and Renly because however you feel about this book you have to agree when Kings clash the whole land trembles.
B000002WEW|3.0|Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite released a year after Elvis at MSG,was probably pointless to release. Who needs a live album two years in a row? Aloha from Hawaii is a much better album that the previous live album from Elvis. The set is considerably different, with very little 50's music making it into the set. A few songs are performed very poorly like Hound Dog, but the majority of the album is enjoyable.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I was very hesitant to see this movie. everyone said it was wonderful but very sad. After I finally watched it, I fell in love with this movie instantly. It's a very touching tearjerker. PLease give it a shot.
B000006TRV|5.0|Please people, stop rating each track individually. You cannot possible rate an album such as `The Wall' in this way.  <br /> <br />And those who rate it as `gloomy and depressing', IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE, FOR ****'S SAKE!! It's about the decent into madness of a Rock star who's off his trolley on puff, neglecting his wife, lost his dad, mollycoddled by his mum and just generally hates the world. Yes it's self indulgent, but look through the indulgence and you will see there's a message here. It's message is similar in a way to Supertramp's `Hide in your shell', in that it's telling you to stop living in your own cocoon of fear and loathing, and to wake up and realise that there are people who care for you, and people with similar or even worse problems than you. <br /> <br />If anything, I find this album uplifting. Just listen to the lyrics on 'Outside the Wall'. <br /> <br />I've listened intently to The Wall for over 24 years. The whole album is a master class in musical production, including the clever subliminal things that you don't notice unless someone brings it to your attention. <br /> <br />Isn't this where...... <br />
