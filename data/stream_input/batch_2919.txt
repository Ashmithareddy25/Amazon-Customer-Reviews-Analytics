B000VZYPB4|3.0|This is utterly hilarious but pretty much consists of random jokes and skits strung onto an overarching theme of sex and fifth-grade humor.
0345803485|5.0|I'm at the 3 rd book right now. Love love love this book. Sexy/sweet love story on a totally different level.
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|I refuse to pay to keep playing, but I find it annoying to have to wait several hours until I have racked up enough energy just to play again!
B0031RSA24|5.0|Very thought provoking and well written. It is interesting to look at biological causes for religiosity. A must for anyone looking at the big questions in life.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|A fast read with a decent twist at the end. A bit predictable but still enjoyable. Good for a weekend!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. My one criticism is there was no tutorial. The clues and puzzles were a challenge without being unsolvable. I am looking forward to more levels.
B009K0P10K|4.0|As with most dramatic series like this, it wasn't quite as good as the first season, but it continued to keep my interest.  I was always anxious to see the next episode.
0780619951|5.0|It's twisted. It's dark. It's Amazing! If you like Val Kilmer, Sci Fi, or just hanging out with a bunch of people that think they are God, You'll Love this movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect for what you need.  This app is great for adding, subtracting, multiplying and even dividing!  Get it now and get your math on!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I think this game is by far the most fun game out there. The only bad part about it, is that it is very addicting.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My nephew is at the stage where he wants to count everything.  He loves the first level of this app!  They count the fruit as he touches it.  He can play this for a very long time, quietly, all by himself, though he prefers to share with the nearest adult.  The only reason it got four instead of 5 stars is that it limits you to counting to five.  It would be nice if it could count to ten or higher.  Still, a good app.  My nephew and I are both looking forward to him progressing to the next level.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Can't wait for the next season!!<br />And for what is to come to poor Travis Fimmel..  His wife in this story should kick his ass..LOL Just sayin.. That is if she doesn't die first.. :(  Glad my friends talked me into watching it!!

B00APJLEGA|5.0|I enjoyed this film immensely.<br /><br />The film was both interesting and funny.<br /><br />Without giving any spoilers, all I can say about the film was that the animation quality was very good and the story line was well thought out.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|I found the reasoning behind the fast diet to be interesting. The first half of the book explains the how's and why's while the second half is testimonials, recipes and calorie tables (which I found useful). After reading the book I decided to go on this diet and after one month I can say that its easy to follow and the results have been better than I expected. So far so good.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is super fun. I can't stop playing it. Especially when you've seen the movie and know the characters and their personalities.  You've got to get and play this app!!!
1451648545|5.0|A well- balanced perspective of this creative, complex genius.  Mr. Isaacson presents his portrayal of Jobs with an appropriate amount of disdain and reverence.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I like this game because you can get hours of fun and not be bored. So I would suggest this game and its suited for  any kids through adults it don't matter and Yahoo that's it
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Got two of these for my girls' kindles. Offers protection for the kindle, but not bulky. Nice flip over that protects the screen.
B000929ASW|5.0|Cold Roses is the ideal Ryan Adams album. Each one of these songs have had such an effect on me, it's easily one of my favorite records of all time. Perfect for people just getting into Ryan or just fans of the folk, alt-country genre. Highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is one of the best games I've played. Get it and you won't regret it! Here is a hint... collect the bananas!
B00CCCF4NW|3.0|I've listened to this album a number of times now, trying to like it more.  But, it's just not up to par with his previous work.  The title track is my favourite and if the rest of the album was that good, it's be 5 stars.  But other than Open Eye signal, the rest of the album doesn't engage me as much and, well, is sort of forgettable.  Still worth the purchase and I'll buy his next album without hesitation.  Just a little disappointed, is all.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|So here's the deal. I have a first generation Google TV (Sony made BD player running Android), so I have been used to the google tv \\"ecosystem\\" for a while. I was hoping that the Chromecast would bring improvements in the way that my computer could interact with the google tv, but alas, I was VERY disappointed.<br /><br />Rather than embracing the idea of open source access as with Android devices, Google has locked the Chromecast down tighter than a young man's ass in federal prison. You cannot stream anything other than what Google has allowed. Amazon prime streaming is NOT included in the short list of options.<br /><br />If the developers wake up and realize that they have made a mistake with locking down access, and open the device up, I would give this a better review. Until then, it's 2 stars.
B003M6WERG|5.0|Great writing. Great acting. Great characters with wonderful interplay and layers of context. This a series for the whole family showing how not everything goes the way you planned, but thngs can work out if you remember what s important.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Trek fan for life.  Good addition to the movie collection.  It was worth the rental.  Great acting and great set design.
B008133MDK|5.0|What can I say? It's a terrific updating of the AC Doyle canon. The only negative I can think of is that so few shows have been produced. The current popularity of Mr. Cumberbatch does not bode well for more, but we can always hope...
B0058W74UY|1.0|This program failed to load properly so I blew it away before even attempting to use it. Good luck with this one.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I've read this book as a child but reading it again fifteen years later adds a whole dimension and depth to this short story. The story of Buck and his life will be told and retold in generations to come. Thank you Jack London.

B005S39YGU|5.0|I love this show. The cast is amazing, and the geek in me loves the physics jokes.<br />Can't wait to watch the other seasons.
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|I expected this book to be interesting, but I didn't expect it to be as thrilling as this. Folk stories tend to get lost with time, but King Samuel Benson has done an impressively great job in preserving these ones. Highly Recommended!
B0094K1K8I|2.0|This movie made me jump a little, but I would not have paid for it. If you are board and want to watch a decent scary movie for free, I would recommend this.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is both fun and entertaining but its also educational. You try to figure out how to get the candy to Om Nom while also avoiding the obstacles. Fun for any age.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|The CGI resulted in my giving such a high score.  The sight of P-40s, P-51s, Bf 109s, Me 262s and B-17s made the movie worth watching.  Why did the producers leave out P-47s which the 332nd FG also flew?  There are too many gross errors in this movie to take it seriously.  Why are the Mustangs flying close escort in the middle of a B-17 box formation.  Even close escort fighters flew above, on either side, in front, or in the back of the bomber formation.  And they would not be flying at the same speed as the bombers but would be weaving at a higher cruising speed.  No American fighter pilot would frontally attack a Me 262 with its four 30 mm cannon which would have shreded the Mustang.  What we see are .50 caliber bullet holes in the Mustang cockpit canopy.  One 30 mm explosive shell would have fragmented it.    We see the P-51 strafing a German destroyer and setting it ablaze from front to back.  This is based on the experience of a flight of the 332nd FG's P-47 on 25 June 1944 where they claimed to have been the only fighter strafing attack to sink a destroyer.  In fact, the \\"destroyer\\" turned out to be a motor torpedo boat, the TA 22, which was ex-Italian, which was only damaged and able to return to port.    The fight with the Me 262s was based on the 24 March 1945 mission and the movie shows the 332nd shooting down four Me 262s for several losses.  In fact, the 332nd claimed three destroyed and three damaged.  The 31st FG was also escorting the bombers and claimed five Me 262s destroyed and three damaged.  Actual German losses were three Me 262s and one damaged, with all four pilots wounded.  None were killed as shown in the film.  The 15th AF was known to be lax in their confirmation procedures and at times the overclaiming was overwhelming.  The 332nd lost five fighters that day, one of which force-landed in Russian territory.    The movie \\"Red Tails\\" is no worse than some of \\"historical\\" documentaries I have seen which also distort the facts but the CGI effects make the movie worth seeing.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|My wife and I are newcomers to this series...as we just happened upon it after running out of Downton series. We are quickly becoming fans of this series as well...although I don't believe it is in production any longer. Too bad.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is a lot of fun. I like simple apps that keep the focus on the challenge and not bells and whistles. Both this app and Factory Balls do that. I also like that I can do this with my kids, and we can puzzle it out together. No glitches on my Fire HD.
B004VFN7BE|5.0|This has been an all-time favorite for my Son and I....and we were together the other weekend panning through Prime Movies...and there it was. For Ole Times Sake...it was fun.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app it was worth 99 cents I would even still use it if it was 1.99 I use it every night very helpful and awesome.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|Not as great as I remembered it being in the movie theatre, but still pretty good. Special effects today are just so much more intense.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for kids when they have spare time between events or in the car. I even play when I am bored great for challenging each other.
B001FB55H6|4.0|I read the comic/book a year or so before the movie came out. It is a masterpiece and perhaps the most engrossing, deep and complex comic I have read. I didn't have decades of built up love and admiration for it so I feel I was able to watch the movie without the prejudice and hatred some die hards have for the film. The movie had no chance of matching the depth and commentary (on comics and the world) that the book was able to deliver and I am okay with that. Justice could only truly be done to this story on HBO. For the approximately three hours Snyder has to work with he delivers the boiled down essence of the story.<br /><br />What works:<br /><br />The opening credits montage is just brilliant. It is the history of the Watchmen world told in stunning imagery with the perfect tone of nostalgia, lost innocence and post-war Americana. The credits lead us from the 1940's through the 1980's. It is only five or so minutes long but is worth three stars on it's own. I pop the Blu-ray in to watch the opening from time to time.<br /><br />Similarly, the origin story of Dr. Manhattan is spot on. You feel the transformation from a man to something alien and god-like. There is love, fear, sadness, regret - essentially an entire movie worth of story compressed into the timeframe of a music video. I could have watched just the Dr. Manhattan story and been satisfied.<br /><br />Rorschach is perfectly cast and comes across true to the book.<br /><br />Visuals are Zack Snyder's forte and this movie is great to look at even with the sound off. He mimics many shots directly from the comic drawings/panels and in general knows the visual language needed for a superhero story.<br /><br />What doesn't work:<br /><br />The ending didn't need to be altered from the book to be effective.<br /><br />Ozymandias seemed miscast and weak - not enough screen presence or menace.<br /><br />The sex scene set to Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen was cringeworthy.<br /><br />The fight scenes were too choreographed and cinematic. There was no sense that these were amateurs playing at being heroes. Instead, they felt like comic heroes from the DC universe at the top of their game which they are most decidedly not supposed to be.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is a solid movie that works more as a visual companion to the book. If watched on its own merits without having read the book it may feel more like an overstuffed tale with too many characters that is trying to do too much at one time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was one I highly recommend. I couldn't put it down. Fabulous characters and twists! My first book by Liane  Moriarty but not my last.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is pretty crazy. My boyfriend, friends, and I have tried literally everything form a Poro in League of Legends to Finn from Adventure Time. Has guessed everything but about 5 things!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good fun and easy to learn.  My eight year-old son got it before me and loves it. Now I am getting addicted.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game a lot. It's super fun, cute, and addicting! Would recommend to anyone, and it's free? What can be better than that?  :)
B000FC130E|5.0|I loved every moment of this story--had me from jump. The worlds Gaiman creates are intricately woven, complex and beautiful, even if a bit predictable. The only two problems--first--there are some serious and important (if subtle) questions still left unanswered. Second, it ended... I want to know more.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This story takes violent anger & heartbreak to the extreme, the kind that overcomes a person unlike most of us could ever imagine. The way the story was told made me not want to put it down just to see if he would ever overcome his breakdown.
B003XDVVO0|5.0|Super comfortable, these are great for wearing around the house as an alternative to slippers. Glad I finally got a pair.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|My Alarm clock is a really enjoyable and easy to use app.  All the features and functions are really easy to access and enable, any time any where!!! I love this app!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The true power of this beautiful story about love, life and survival, lies in its different and diverse narrators.  HOSSEINI masterfully connects his rich characters through a main storyline, but simultaneously gives each of them a life of their own and a moment to shine. HOSSEINI remains faithful to the style of writing that made him one of my favorite authors.
B00CHMBQRA|5.0|Arron Eckhart has been someone to watch since Battle: Los Angles, as the tough Marine sergeant. Having liked the movie very much I've decided to check into this one. It was great. The enemy is over rated as being the CIA. Then every one is after him and his daughter, because he's the last one alive who worked on a project they didn't know was funded by the CIA. I hope in his next movie the CIA is played as what they really are, an information gathering agency, who cannot work their stuff on American soil. They are not a real James Bond.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Luv this show watch it daily will continue to do so keep watching this everyday till I watch the last show
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. It was so real, so funny, so sad, so happy and after all that a twist in the tail. Fantastic characters and it made me feel like I was there. Perfect reading.
034580709X|4.0|Having read several other Harry Hole novels before this one, I was glad to be able to &#34;return&#34; to the beginning and learn about Harry from the start.  While reading I thought I had figured out &#34;whodunit&#34; but there were plenty of twists and turns to keep me guessing.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|A sweet romance that will make young people hopeful and seniors nostalgic. It's an easy-read take on Romeo & Juliet, without the deaths and with modern references and lovable, quirky characters.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This movie is 'high' Sci-Fi, as opposed to 'low' Sci-Fi.  What this means is this :  It's meant to provoke you to think and ponder the prospects of the story's scenario.  Therefore, it's a GREAT Sci-Fi for true Sci-Fi fans, whereas, it may not be well suited for someone whose expecting your normal Tom Cruise type action movie.  Though it has really good action, it's more a Sci-Fi drama than an action movie.  The effects and production value are TOP NOTCH.  The director was very good, as was the acting.<br /><br />The movie kind of leaves you hanging with all sorts of unanswered questions, and, for me at least, this is not a bad thing.  I was left wanting to know more about what happened before the movie's time frame, as well as after.  In fact, I'd bet that if they did a part 2 based on what occurred BEFORE the movie's time-frame, it'd be great to see !<br /><br />The robotic sentries in the movie actually stole a few scenes they were in...they were truly well depicted, and, for the first time an any film I've seen, a robotic presence actually felt scary...scary because incredibly capable, tough, and ruthless.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to see this movie.  Cruise does a great job, and his character ends up being quite complex and human.  The effects are beautiful to behold.  In fact, this movie is a pleasure to behold because the lighting and effects are at times staggeringly beautiful.  No cheese in this movie.  No filler either.  I only wish it could have covered a bit more terrain in relation to its core conception of story and related events.  But I'm not complaining.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is. the best game app in the hole intier world and an asem good grate gratefully incredable game app.

B00571F26Y|4.0|I used to suffer from terrible bloating caused by wheat. Sarah Palings 'The Soccer Mom Diet' steered us away from carbs; especially wheat, to a more raw food diet.<br /><br />Dr William Davis goes much further in his book The Wheat Belly to show us the harmful effects of having too much wheat in our diets. Eliminating it all together leads to better gut health and over body health
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|wow people are really quick to judge this game without even playing it. yes you can erase lines. there is an eraser. just tap the pencil icon and it changes. dumb peeps can really ruin an apps rep.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Would highly recommend the movie to anyone who loves a good romance movie. It is a very good movie for the whole family.
B00386EZJU|5.0|This is a fantastic CD with plenty of activity to keep your attention through the end. The first five notes grab the listener from the start with their deep and awe inspiring melody, and from then on, the listener is kept wanting to hear more. The CD has been beautifully edited to include every theme in the movie, but takes out some of the smaller transitions, helping to move the CD along. There are a few seconds here and there throughout the CD will not be found in the movie, and the entire last track (The Vikings Have Their Tea) is not in the movie either.<br /><br />The only song on this CD that was not written by John Powell is Track 14, Sticks and Stones by J&oacute;nsi, the singer of the Icelandic band Sigur R&oacute;s. The directors thought that J&oacute;nsi's work is so \\"bright and infectious and happy\\" that they decided to ask him if he would be interested in writing a piece for the end credits. J&oacute;nsi watched the film in London while Powell was finishing up the score and had such a positive response to the film that he wrote Sticks and Stones in just a few days.<br /><br />John Powell is known for variety and inventiveness in his scores and How to Train Your Dragon is no exception. Beautifully written and well crafted, this score is constantly changing in instrumentation, timbre, harmony, and many other ways. Powell used many smaller motifs that are mixed together throughout the film, hardly ever following the same pattern twice. Powell also used some specific themes in the movie. For instance, nearly every time you see Toothless (the dragon) or every time Toothless plays an important part, you will hear this beautiful, leaping, D2 sequence which changes in instrumentation, harmony, or rhythm each time you hear it to match the drama on screen. When you first hear this Toothless theme, it is played by strings in octaves giving it this strained quality and depicting the fear in Toothless' eyes (13:42 into the movie; Track 3, Downed Dragon, 3:15). The next time you hear it is when Hiccup attempts to befriend Toothless (29:15 into the movie; Track 8 Forbidden Friendship, 0:11). This time it is completely changed. Light, beautiful, syncopated at times, and played by mallet instruments and pizzicato strings.<br /><br />Another main theme in the film is the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. The very first notes you will hear are of this theme, but it's not heard again until Hiccup has to decide whether or not to kill Toothless. Here, Powell plays the first four notes in tight dissonance, and the fifth and final note in a major key. This is such a beautiful foreshadowing of what will come from this decision. The theme is beautifully realized in the end of the film after Hiccup wakes up from his injury in battle. At this point, Powell plays this theme in the piano. It's the only time the piano is heard in the entire score and it is completely soloed. This striking contrast characterizes the simple love between Hiccup and Toothless.<br /><br />In watching the filmmaker's commentary on the DVD, directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders mention some of their decisions about the music for their film. In this commentary they talk about how music is so important to them, that whenever they create a film, they try to find places where they can eliminate dialogue and feature the music. Chris Sanders said: \\"It's something that Dean and I learned a while ago. That we would try to engineer places in our films where we could just let the dialogue... just let it go.\\" Dean DeBlois continues this thought, \\"Let the music take over. We're such fans of the scores of these movies, and to find, on purpose, to find places where the score can carry it. The score and the visuals. I'm very proud the fact that we have three places in this film where that happens.\\"<br /><br />As mentioned above, there are a few times where there is music on the CD that is not in the movie. The filmmakers mention this in the commentary as some of the decisions that were made on the mixing stage. For instance, the first 48 seconds of Track 3, The Downed Dragon, are not in the movie. These 48 seconds were written to play under the scene where Stoick and his friend Gobber are talking about what to do with Hiccup and how to keep him safe (10:14 into the movie). In the commentary, one of the directors mentioned that \\"music is always there to deepen whatever the mood is going to be, but there's a couple places where removing the music actually made that particular moment feel more serious, and that was one of them.\\" Another place where music was obviously written and not used is when Hiccup and his friend Astrid are talking about how to save Toothless from the Vikings (1:07:40 into the movie; Track 19, Ready the Ships 1:22-2:23).<br /><br />These are just a few of the endless examples of ingenious, creative, and inspired work done on the underscore to How to Train Your Dragon. This wonderfully written score truly captures the life of this film, and leads viewers to the heart of its story.<br /><br />For my complete review, go here: [...]the mixing stage.

B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Sugar is a different style Physics puzzle game where you use Ingenuity and varying Strategies to divert Sugar from a spout to Coffee Mugs using only Gravity and lines you draw to direct the flow.  Starts off easy but gets much harder when filters have to be used to Change the Sugar color to match the colored mugs.  Proper Sequence of diversions as well as good Timing Is necessary to get all the Sugar Flows to work properly to fill the appropriate mugs before the sugar runs out.  On some levels you can use Reverse Gravity button to move sugar in different ways.  On other levels, sugar can get below your cups but will then go off screen and flow from Top of screen if you divert it properly.  Well designed levels!  The Music is strange but Soothing.<br /><br />Overall, a refreshingly different style of Physics game that keeps you Engaged.  Makes you scratch your head with some unique dillemas until you figure them out.  Unfortunately there are No Instructions except for telling what Buttons do.  No Hints available either.  However, if you stick with it, the needed strategy becomes more obvious as you go along and it becomes more Fun to play.  I like the game and it works well.  I wish the Graphics were more sophisticated though.  INTRUCTIONS and/or HINTS would also improve it greatly.  Still, it's a Good, Worthy and nicely Challenging game.

B000HL2J0G|3.0|One of the other programs I watch mentioned &#34;MacGyvering&#34; when they were fixing a tractor.  I'd been wanting to see what that was about so I watched some episodes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|An awesome game for kids or any horse lover. Graphics are fantastic and the game play provides an idea of what it's like to care for a horse. Love the pretty rainbow unicorn!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Initial I had trouble getting it to work.  I was running windows 8 on my machine, had the driver installed (from their website), and received \\"network unidentified\\" error.  But today, it is just working for some reason.  I did a speed test and on my 100Mbps connection, I got a 92Mbps download speed.  So it does work really well.  The lights are really handy for debugging the status of the device, to see if its working and what might be wrong (and looks cool).  What's also great is that they have drivers for all OS's.
B00ECU1A6C|5.0|I love my little ponies, its one of the rare kids shows I truly enjoy watching as a family. This movie was super cute and def a family favorite.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Not a literary masterpiece, but an easy read. Good plot that keeps you reading. Great holiday reading on the beach.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|This movie instills bad habits in children while showing the mean people (bullies) are human too.  While they are human too I know this type of behavior is not the norm I wish to teach.  We need to teach understanding of bullies and acceptance, not embrace them.  They become leaders because good people do nothing but watch these type of movies.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|A wonderful tale, that twists and turns. Not a thriller, but historically weird and full of strange surprises that includes an elephant.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|The only criticism I have is that this album is missing the original remake of Friends in Low Places, the one where he initially added the alternate ending.  What is here is excellent, however, and it's a thoroughly enjoyable album.

B004Q84YFY|2.0|I recently bought an Emotiva surround-sound system which, coupled with an Oppo SACD player, has opened up my ears to a whole new level of audio detail. My SACDs finally sound remarkably better than my regular CDs. So I was excited to put on the Sticky Fingers SACD; the earlier ABKCO SACDs sounded great on my system, so I thought this one would as well.<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />Although there is a lot of detail here that I had never noticed before, there is unfortunately very little bass and the high end hurts. I can't crank this album - the pain is too much.<br /><br />I put on my 1990s Virgin remaster CD of the album and the bass was great. My only gripe was that the resolution wasn't as good as the SACD.<br /><br />I also purchased the Exile On Main Street SHM SACD, and sure enough, it suffers from the same problem.<br /><br />So now I'm stuck with a bad decision every time I want to hear these remarkable albums - put on a high resolution version at a low volume or put on a 16-bit CD and crank it.<br /><br />No more SHM SACDs for me (they're way overpriced anyway).<br /><br />Whoever mastered this SACD should never be allowed near a mastering facility again...
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The characters keep you wanting to read more and more. Glad there are more books in this fun, teen series
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Wonderful cast, intelligent script, and JOSS WHEDON.  What could be better?  I imagine FOX is kicking themselves now for cancelling....
068484267X|5.0|It met my daughter's school requirement. Glad I got it at a better price thru amazon!! Thank you so much!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best app in the history of apps, kiloo's only game is a hit!!! great app and above all its free but sadly theres a lot of advertisements
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the fact that this game has all type of element in it! this is for all ages have fun playing this
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Very good visuals, futuristic technology and lots of action. Of course if you're a \\"Trekkie\\" you will love anything related to Star Trek.  I loved Star Trek back in the day too, but this movie was just OK IMHO. As always, James T. Kirk/ Mr. Spock/crew save the ship under impossible conditions. You KNOW they'll always get out of any predicament.
B00B3L3RPA|5.0|The is a story engulfed in irony. Once you get past the diction it is pretty understandable. More importantly the original Frankenstein is better than movie ever related to it. A man's elongated sorrow. A beast born into conviction bit strives for affection this is truly a story of unrequited love and unquenchable vengeance.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is the best TV series to come along in a very long time.<br />Very well written, very well acted, very nicely produced.<br />I wish Stephen King could get in on it.<br />If you're the kind of person who appreciates a good zombie story....you need to get your popcorn ready and get this entire series!
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|After an entertaining and occasionally believable first season, Suits descended into make believe and did it badly in season two. Lot's of  deus ex machina substituting for convincing plot devices. Good looking, but not worth your time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have to say....PBS really knows it's stuff when it comes to quality TV programming.<br />Downton Abbey is without a doubt one of the finest programs ever presented to us....and if you didn't already know that....it's not too late to catch the wave my friend.  Get this series and treat yourself to some fine storytelling.
0553565915|2.0|Most all of Her account of Seeing God sounds like a dream. She claims being a spirit with no physical body and yet she sees people  in heaven working on looms, making material for the spirits that will arrive and of three Men dressed like monks! Her account seems more like a disney movie then anything else. Another account of a spirit trying to get two people on earth together so that She would become their child is a little far fetched. This book is more like a fantasy novel then a true story.<br />Harold

B00B9B4IYI|5.0|I use the FiiO D3 Digital to Analog converter in conjunction with the Yamaha YBA-11 to patch into the RCA inputs on most of my audio components. With the FiiO converter you don't have to limit the use of the YBA-11 to components with a digital input. This opens up boomboxes, older recievers, and powered speakers to bluetooth compatibility! The YBA-11 seems to be a terrific unit with great range too. Here is a link to the FiiO D3, grab one and really start to enjoy your YBA-11.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005K2TXMO FiiO D3 (D03K) Digital to Analog Audio Converter With Micca 6ft Optical Toslink Cable - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DAC]]<br /><br />Hope this helps some of you out.

B00A3AUGEW|3.0|I just tried to download this album and was forced to install the cloud player in order to do so.  I don't want the cloud player, I don't need the cloud player, I refuse to have the cloud player on my computer or any other device.  The fact that Amazon feels the need to make me get it just so I can download the music I paid for is maddening to me.  I will not buy another digital recording from Amazon until they knock off this behavior.
B000G6BM00|5.0|I love this series from the first movie to the last one.<br />This edition has some nice added scenes.<br />Great movie and I highly recommend it to sci-fi lovers.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|When I first got this app, I loved it. Beautiful graphics and relaxing music made for enjoyable game play. I have purchased items to make game play more successful and though there were ads for other disney apps, that was fine. Over the last few days though, they have started frequently interrupting game play with video ads. Very annoying and given that I am already a paying player, surprising. They are so frequent and intrusive, I've given up play and would not recommend download. Too bad, it was a beautiful game.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love that bingo blitz is a social game super fun and free to play. Five stars for sure all the way.
1115047779|1.0|The print was very hard to read because it was a poor copy of an book eith only chapter six of ten in Les Miserables.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love  this game. It has great graphics. I love how you can buy tack for your horse and compete. You can feed, pet, and train your horse. It's a great game all the way around.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Would be five stars if I didn't find out when I got a new kindle I couldn't get back to my original reef. They have me contacting customer service...really and wait a few days for a response. This is a game shouldn't be so hard to recover my game. The game itself is very fun and easy to progress levels. Beautiful scenery and fish!
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Our family loves Harry Potter!  I just introduced my 7 yr old to the magical world and hr loves it too!!  I may hold off on the next ones since they do get darker and scarier.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Our chimney starters worked well.  They are sturdy and hold up to the heat.  They are  higher quality than our former ones.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|After reading a boat load of books and watching dozens of movies set in the same time period, I was excited to have stumbled upon Lark Rise to Candleford.  I have a difficult time sitting still for even a half hour television show so for me, the first two episodes were almost so slow that I nearly gave up.  The story line is unique and there are a number of familiar actors so I opted to give it a little more time.  The focus is more on the working class, unlike most of my other stories in this time period that revolve primarily around upper class families.  Before I knew it, I found myself not wanting to turn it off and watching multiple episodes at a time.  Finished season one now on to season two!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|So, a lot of my friends had told me how much they loved Dr. Who.  I never really got into it myself, because I assumed it would just be some campy Brittish thing.<br /><br />It IS certainly a campy Brittish thing, but OH MY GOD this show is brilliant and funny and entertaining.  Highly recommended!
B00CTT9646|1.0|I was very surprised in how poor the quality was, the parts were uneven. The paint was so caked on - I feel like this was an old used product that was refurbished. i just cant believe how bad it is, the tip that supposed to move get stuck and I have to force it into place. How can this be limited ???
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is a nice change from the other find games it's complicated at times but fun as well nice game
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|this was a great read and so inspirational - i would recommend it to anyone who is looking for reflection
B00E25KVLW|1.0|this book is just a simple, useless and redundant kindle version of the ruby on rails guide available online . Don't buy it
157421327X|4.0|Heard about Zentangle in another context. Found this a good way to get in to the practice. (I almost said habit) Will recommend this for other people, especially those who say they can't draw. With this you can't miss!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I almost put it down and did not pick it back up. Once I continued to read, then I could not put it down. This book was very heart wrenching. Great read and I highly recommend this book!!!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Haunting and sad, beautiful and glorious, a picture of a world gone by that hasn't changed so much after all. I'm glad I finally picked up The Book Thief.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I found it a little hard to follow and keep my attention in the beginning, but stuck with it and loved it. On to the third one!

1401941893|5.0|I was skeptical about this book because several of the reviews I read were bad. I was pleasantly surprised. I've gotten valuable life lessons straight from here and my friends have even said I seem like a happier person lately. If you take the messages to heart it can alter how you think positively. I'm so grateful that I bought this book and I seriously recommend it.

1594746168|2.0|I was very excited to receive The Resurrectionist by E. B. Hudspeth from the LibraryThing Early Reviewers program. I love a good fantastical nonfiction that brings to life and reality all of the fun fantasy critters we adore ;-). However, I found my expectations were somewhat misplaced, since The Resurrectionist is not a book about dragons and satyrs being real and dug up. Instead it is a story about a mad \\"scientist\\" who constructs mythical creatures from tortured animals and humans in his desperation to be right about their existence. While The Ressurectionist might appeal to those who love a macabre premise and some pretty illustrations, it was not my cup of tea.<br />Note: I received a copy of The Resurrectionist to review through the LibraryThing Early Reviewers program.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /> The premise of The Resurrectionist is interesting. I think all lovers of fantasy like to think about whether mermaids and all the other mythical beasts could have been real. I love the idea of a \\"nonfiction\\" book diving into that concept.<br />The illustrations in the second half of the book are lovely and very detailed with all the anatomy of various beasts.<br />The first part of The Resurrectionist definitely felt like a real biography, complete with newspaper clippings and quotes.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /> There were some flaws with the historical set up. Dr. Black refers to genes and inheritance quite frequently and while was working on his theory at the time the book was supposed to be set, he had no idea how inheritance would have worked because DNA and genes had not been discovered yet. It was quite annoying to someone who has studied genetics even briefly.<br />We are going to continue on the science flaws bandwagon here with the flaws of how evolution was presented. While it is entirely possible these were on purpose because Dr. Black was obviously insane towards the end of his life, it still annoys and evolutionary scientist when evolution is presented as the body trying to reach a goal. That is not how it works at all.<br />Further, what Dr. Black was doing in the second half of his life is not science at all. The Resurrectionist continues to refer to his madness as science, when he was really just performing macabre surgeries for carnivals....<br />Finally, the whole story of The Resurrectionist was just waaaaay too creepy for me. Dr. Black is told to have sewn bird wings onto a living dog to try to prove it could work, and the torture and suffering of the animal is described in quite a lot of detail. Dr. Black didn't keep to animals either, and there are hints of the horrible things he did to human beings to try to recreate harpies and snake-women.... Just too much for me personally.<br /><br />Summary:<br />If you enjoy a creepy story with lots of illustrations to accompany it, then you might enjoy The Resurrectionist more than I did. Unfortunately, The Resurrectionist had various scientific and historic flaws that I just could not let go of and the general tone of the story was not what I enjoy.as the body trying to reach a goal.

0439023513|4.0|I'm thrilled to say that I've finally caught up and finished Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins! I was able to find a copy of the audiobook on my library Overdrive, woot! It was also excellent timing since it let me start Mockingjay right after finishing Catching Fire, definitely necessary ;-). Mockingjay is a spectacular conclusion to this already spectacular trilogy and a book I'm tempted to listen to again if I find myself low on audiobooks >.>. The narration is amazing for Mockingjay and Catching Fire (probably Hunger Games, too, but I only listened to the last two!). If you haven't finished this trilogy yet, or want to reread it, I definitely recommend the audiobook! There will also be spoilers for the first two books!<br /><br />Strengths:<br />I loved that Mockingjay departed from the \\"games\\" plot line that has been in the last two books. Obviously there aren't any Hunger Games to participate in now >.>.<br />We finally get to see much more of the real Panem and the Capitol in Mockingjay, beyond what we peeked at in Catching Fire.<br />The character developments in Mockingjay were heart-wrenching and compelling. We got to know Gale much better since he's finally able to be around some, and there is just a lot to find out about all the characters that didn't play major roles in the first two books.<br />The plot twists! The last third of the book confused me greatly at times for other reasons, but the plot twists made it all better :D.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br />Without going into too much detail, I really didn't like parts of the ending. The commentary they made on all the preceding events (and deaths) was just horrible. I'll discuss more at the end ;-).<br />Some of the character deaths seemed arbitrary and unnecessary. Yes, they pulled at my heartstrings, but was that the only point??<br />Love triangle drama... :(<br /><br />Summary:<br />I had a couple of reservations about the ending of Mockingjay, however I am very glad that I finally finished The Hunger Games trilogy. It was an epic and wild ride. I am now even more excited for the movies to come out so that I can relieve the adventure all over again :D. Anyone who loves epic adventure, compelling writing, and a great dystopian world should definitely finish this trilogy. While you're at it, try to find a copy of the audio version and let your ears smile, hehe!mes trilogy. It was an epic and wild ride.

055358894X|5.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch is an excellent example of a top-notch fantasy story and a top-notch audiobook. I stumbled upon The Gentleman Bastards series when I requested the third book on NetGalley without realizing it was a third book. I am so glad I did! I am loving this hilariously uncouth writing, superb world-building, and wonderfully imperfect cast of characters.<br />Note: I purchased The Lies of Locke Lamora on Audible.<br />This book has adult content.<br /><br />Strengths:<br />First off, the narration for The Lies of Locke Lamora is simply fabulous. I cannot recommend the audiobook of this story enough! Each character has their own unique voice, female characters are well done by the male narrator, and even the various disguises of the main character have their own voice (quite impressive if you ask me!).<br />The Lies of Locke Lamora has some of the most inventive and entertaining swearing I have ever encountered. I don't generally run into this much swearing in a fantasy book, but it worked perfectly to set The Lies of Locke Lamora apart from all other fantasy stories I've read.<br />Locke Lamora is not a heroic wielder of amazing magic, but The Lies of Locke Lamora still have an intricate magic system that we get hints of throughout the story. I was amazed at how well the world was built and the magic was built without having a hero of ages complex (ie, the main characters were not the most special people in the history of the world).<br />While The Lies of Locke Lamora is quite long, the storytelling makes it completely worth it. All the details are important and come together into a beautiful work of plotting and scheming ;-).<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /> There are basically no women in The Lies of Locke Lamora.... There are a couple of noblewomen that play fairly prominent secondary character roles, but they are both duped by Locke, so that doesn't really work for me. There is also a female thief that is referred to frequently, and I assume with show up in later books, but she didn't show up in this one, so she doesn't count.<br />There are these interludes that flash back to Locke's youth, but you start in one, so it feels at first like you are flashing forward during the non-interludes. It was a bit confusing to figure out what the main storyline was going to be at first, but I did get used to it.<br /><br />Summary:<br />I very much looked forward to all of my long drives because I knew that I was going to be listening to The Lies of Locke Lamora. I'm torn between listening to or reading the next book because I want to continue listening to such a great narrator, but I also want to be able to read the next book more quickly than audiobooks let me. So conflicting! In any case, if you don't mind creative and amusing swearing (but lots of it!) you should most definitely read The Lies of Locke Lamora in preparation for the third book coming out this fall. This is a series that I have no doubt I will love all the way through.sume with show up in later books, but she didn't show up in this one, so she doesn't count.<br />There are these interludes that flash back to Locke's youth, but you start in one, so it feels at first like you are flashing forward during the non-interludes.

1402210795|5.0|Although considered a romance, this Heyer is comic writing at its best. The supporting characters - Gil, George, and Ferdy - friends of the protagonists, steal the stage (page?), as Regency-era Bernie Woosters. Readers who enjoy witty dialogue and situational comedies will enjoy this gem of a book.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I had actually seen this movie before and thoroughly enjoyed it!  Judi was great in this film.  It was well worth the purchase!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I missed watching Season 4 on TV, so I was excited to know that via Amazon I could watch all of the episodes I missed on my Kindle Fire. I have loved watching The Good Wife from the beginning of the series, so it was great to be able to catch up with Season 4.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Most hard core Star Trek fans probably hate this film. I can understand that feeling. Making the bad guy turn out to be Khan was an easy way out but it made no sense. They could have made him - similar - to Khan. The actor doesn't look the least like Khan.  But that's not the only problem. There was absolutely NO REASON for the Carol Marcus underwear scene. That was just plain stupid.<br /><br />I can now accept the continuity issues. After all, this is a reboot rather than a remake. I like the cast very much. They are not clones of the original actors but they have the essence of personality done very well. J.J. Abrams action sequences are great, IMO. The film is a good ride if you excuse the continuity issues. I'd like to see this cast do a lot more perhaps as a TV series with focus on personalities and social issues as the original series did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this in preparation for the movie (and because my friend Lauren turned me onto the series) and I absolutely loved this book. Great follow up to the first one and an absolutely phenomenal ending. You'd be hard pressed to not want to start Mockingjay right after finishing this one. One of the most exciting conclusions I can remember reading in any book. I cannot wait for the movie.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Poor interface, not optimized for small screen. Have to keep zooming in and out, and multiple search results seem to favor quantity if sellers sales over quality
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Excellent movie!  Great job by the makers.  Good acting, well done and a whirlwind ride keeping you on the edge of your seat.<br />Only complaint:  sometimes there were major reveals or conclusions made within the movie between characters or said by characters that were said or divulged too fast.  Good to watch at home and rewind at times to figure out the plot twists.
1250030951|5.0|Cather and Wren Avery are identical twins that are headed off to college. While Wren is confident that she is going to have the best college experience ever, Cath is nervous. Cath is sure she will get through the experience with a lot of interest in her hobby - writing fan fiction. In particular being a Simon Snow (the magical series written by Gemma Leslie) fangirl.  In \\"Fangirl\\" the girls navigate their freshman year of college. While Wren shows her independence (she doesn't even want to be roommates with Cath) and parties her way through her first year, Cath clings to her fan fiction and tries her best to survive her freshman year.<br /><br />For me, Fangirl was a much hyped release. I knew quite a few bloggers that had received advance copies and were touting that this book was THE book to read for the Fall. Needless to say I had to read it the week it was released. I'm pleased to say that Fangirl lives up to all of its hype.<br /><br />Within the first few pages I could completely relate to Cath. No I don't have a twin sister, but I am the shy, nervous type that would much rather have her head buried in a book than navigate new social connections.  Watching Cath navigate her first year of college reminded me so much of my own experiences, and I loved watching it through Cath's eyes.<br /><br />I also fell head over heels about the concept of a book about fangirling and fan fiction. While I don't read fan fiction, I fangirl over so many books and authors, and I could just relate to this so much. Did I say that this book is so relatable? It is. It is a real look at college life and geek life, and I simply loved it!!<br /><br />There is a lot that goes on in this book: absent mother, alcoholism, mental issues and it was all written into the plot beautifully. With a set of fabulous characters, this character driven story stole my heart completely.<br /><br />Fangirl will definitely be on my Top 3 Favourite Books of 2013, if not my absolute favourite.
B00E9PMML2|3.0|I'm curious what the difference is between this set and the one that was released 2 years ago. The description doesn't help with that at all.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|I bough the 100 Year Old Man online without much research but I am so glad I did. It is a delightful and outrageous romp, full of rich and colourful characters in impossible situations. The book is written in a lighthearted style with deep affection for the main character and wonderful humour. The subject matter, which can get a bit dark at times, is delivered with a light touch, and great sensitivity.  I saw some slight parallels with Harold Fry, but for me this book was much better.<br /><br />Allan Karlsson is about to celebrate his 100th birthday in his old folks home (which he hates) and on impulse turns his back on the forthcoming celebrations, climbs out of his window and sets off on an adventure. Within a few hours he has stolen a suitcase full of millions of Dutch Crowns, become complicit in a murder and is on the run with an unlikely band of conspirators. It sounds pretty dreadful but at no time do you feel anything but warmth and support for this old man and his unlikely adventure. It gets more complicated and much of the book's real impact comes from the interlacing of flashbacks to his life, during which, on his journey across much of the world, he meets an array of world figures, national leaders and even helps to invent the atom bomb. It is a completely harmless but enthralling adventure, full of impossible, but strangely plausible scenarios, serendipitous meetings and amazing narrow escapes. You can't help but root for this old man. He has a profound effect on world events during his lifetime but is almost blissfully unaware of his impact. It's not quite Forrest Gump, but the unintentional innocent impacting on world events does have an echo there.<br /><br />Its a fantastic book. A total flight of pure nonsense fantasy. You won't regret reading this.,

As a fan of John Green's Youtube channel, Vlogbrothers, I had decided to read his latest work, The Fault in Our Stars. I was pulled in the book within the first few chapters.<br /><br />  The Fault in Our Stars is a story about a girl named Hazel Lancaster. She is 16 years old with terminal thyroid cancer, and is forced to carry around an oxygen tank and cannula wherever she goes to help her breathe. Her parents make her go to a Cancer Support group to help with her cancer. The Cancer Support group is a small group of about 10 children, all with some form of cancer. The support group is dull and uninteresting, until she meets a boy named Augustus Waters. Augustus suffered from Osteoarcoma (a type of bone cancer), and he now wears a prosthetic leg. Both of them fall for each other, and when Augustus decides to take Hazel to see \\"V for Vendetta\\", the plot unfolds into a story of Brobdingnagian proportions that will make a reader cry, laugh and smile.<br /><br />  What I truly enjoyed about this book, is not only the plot, but the portrayal of teenage life, the quality of the English, and the realism. This Book is young adult literature, and when I had heard this was a love story, I (and an assuming reader) was expecting cheeky \\"boycrushes\\" (quoting another reviewer), lust, and breakup. However, I was in for something extraordinarily different when I saw Hazel and Augustus. She shows her intelligence with her words, her emotions with her struggle against cancer. \\"This World is not a wish granting factory\\" is a quote that saddened me when we learn about Augustus's cancer. Hazel is inquisitive and smart, just like Augustus; they contemplate life, purpose, philosophy unlike day-to day teenagers who can't imagine their situation.<br /><br />  The message of the book is by far, a message that I will never forget. Augustus says that humans are always trying to leave a mark on this world, to be remembered after death, to do something memorable. However, he says something very different about Hazel. Hazel \\"treads the earth lightly\\"; she doesn't care about the mark that she makes, and instead notices the small felicities of life, notices that her time on earth is short, and she must enjoy it to her fullest, not get caught up in making a mark in history, to try to be remembered. \\"That is the real heroism in her\\", says Augustus.<br /><br />I hope everyone enjoyed this review, and will purchase The Fault in Our Stars. I will move on to John Green's first book, Looking for Alaska
B000GFLE1S|5.0|Brilliant acting !!! And it is based on a true story... made a fabulous Broadway show which I saw last May in NYC !
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|One of the best albums JL has put out. Smooth and sexy! I have played it over 3 times in one day.  :-)
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|This is an album that demands attention. Do not try to listen to it simply in the background, it must take the forefront of your mind. It explores a music that is darker than the standard Sigur Ros fare, yet does so elegantly and without feeling forced or too different from their known style. I love listening to it.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|We really enjoyed it! While we knew it might not be as good as the first one just because it's the nature of sequels there was still plenty of excitement and very entertaining. The acting was great and the plot was there. Taking those into consideration we liked it.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|I bought this for my brother thinking it was the soundtrack for the movie.<br />I was disappointed when I realized it was the movie, which he already has, but it ended up that one of my sisters wanted it so it was a great buy just the same.  I need to be more careful when I order next time to be sure I am ordering what I think I am ordering.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I thought it held up to the Star Trek tradition. Action, drama, suspense, all there.  I hope there is another one to come.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie and the actors did a really good job, I really enjoy movies with a happy endings.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|One sentence: Anyone giving this anything short of 4 stars should not be allowed to review anything on Amazon.  I'm not just saying that because it's a \\"patriotic\\" book.  I'm saying that because this is an excellent book full stop.  Some of the early chapters can be skipped over, but once he starts talking about SEAL training I didn't put my Kindle down for 6 hours until I had finished it.<br /><br />I'll add that I bought the Kindle version and it worked fine on both my phone and Paperwhite.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Everything in this film, the length, the violence, and the attempt at humor, was over the top, and perhaps that is the point. However,Tarantino needs an editor!
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|The author has a wonderful way of subtly weaving together the stories of several characters whose connections were sometimes close, sometimes fleeting.  The use of the story of the tightrope walker was genius!
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Fabulous movie. It is easy to love these characters after just a few short minutes on the screen. The acting is well done. Follows the storyline of the book very closely. A great glimpse into the lives of those who lived during this time.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is not bad. Good amount of upgrades, simple controls, and good amount of choices when it comes to levels or vehicles. I'm still playing it and it's staying on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i LOVE DIS GAMES!!!!! Its sofun that i could pass out ( i think ) :) anywY i have minecraft pe combuter and my friend has it for xbox if you guys are noobiez for block games dis is ur game

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great on devices that we could get it to sync with, but wouldn't work on an older MAC, and said it wouldn't work on an older (2007) IBM PC, but did end up working. Awesome once you get it on your machine
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like the game and so does the rest of my family but honestly I think it is very hard to get gru coins. I am glad they added the beach level because running through the same level does get boring.  I don't think I have found a lot of the secret places yet either and after running through it so many times,  those suckers must be hidden good.  overall very fun to help pass the time.
B004VB3UYW|3.0|My all time favorite cookbooks is the Data Mining Cookbook by Olivia Par Rudd and another favorite book is the Little SAS Book.  These preferences reveal my SAS (and SPSS) background.  The comparison with Rudd's book is a little unfair because Rudd's is a cookbook for a vertical subject which the R Cookbook is not intended to be.  The Little SAS Book, however, would have been a good little volume to model the R Cookbook after --especially as many R users reading these types of books are newcomers from SAS.    Had I read the R Cookbook book twenty years ago, I would have loved it.  As I have it in the Kindle version, however, its competition is the forums in Google and I found myself more eager to try the forums first.    For beginners in R like me, however, buying it does add a degree of security in the undertaking so I do not regret buying it.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I probably would not have purchased his album if I had not seen Sheeran live in concert. He is a musical genius and this album is such a pleasure to listen to.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A must read. Much more than just a historical event. The shear drive and determination is awe inspiring. You should bookmark certain pages for future inspiration.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|It's The Hobbit!  What is not to like!!  This made a special gift for my husband and something to watch with our teenager kids.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have read all of Me Gregory's books related to the queens of England/Tudors.  I find this one to.be her best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE this app. It's so look fun to play and battle!!!!! I definitely recommend this app to people!!!! It's so fun!!!!!
140006922X|1.0|...just a warning.  This person's background [...] leads me to believe this is an ideological attempt to water down and discredit the whole basis of Christian belief by a person whose beliefs have swung back toward being Muslim more than Christian.  As a Christian believer, I have no interest in this book, and I would warn other believers away from it.    The book itself looks to be a deceptively slick and attractive product, a very good disguise for what lies within.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I enjoy this game but find the screen does freeze often. I also find occasionally I do not receive my daily bonus. The chats in this game get racy from time to time also
B001ECE6C6|5.0|Upojenie's voice is as a siren of Hercules.  She makes Metheny's music come alive and complements him perfectly.  The album contains a nice variety of musical styles, oriental, jazz, and Metheny's usual mystical and magical innovations.  I listened to is during a long drive and never got tired of it.
B008469DGY|5.0|I truly enjoy playing this cute little game.  It is easy to learn and quite fun to play.  Hours of fun and you can't beat the price.  Well with downloading.  Enjoy!
B000CZ0Q5W|4.0|Metheny seems to have a bit more introspection on this album than usual.  Many very serene titles that let one relax and watch a sunset with full enjoyment.
0345525558|4.0|I rather enjoyed this bittersweet tale of the abuses of life and the harshness of growing up without love. I appreciated the realism that Victoria--being newly freed from the hells of Foster-care--is alone, broke and troubled as she tries to make her way in the world. Through much strife, the language of flowers serves as a salve to the inner wounds of a troubled spirit.  It's important to see that there are many young teens out there suffering in today's world, not back in the world of Charles Dickens.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Once you figure out the many characters I the story,it became very interesting to follow how they were all tied together.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My kindle fire stopped charging.  I was told to purchase this item with the Kindle PowerFast.  It worked!  Now my kindle is charging just fine.  And I love the longer 5ft length.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|So much depended n the master treating his slaves well or not. The poor blacks had no choice but to give into the rapes & starvation if the master was bad. But good does triumph over evil!

B000FC2PKG|5.0|this is the first Lisa Gardner book I have read.  I saw her having dinner with her family recently and someone mentioned that she was an author of mystery books taking place in the Boston area.  I love mystery book and used to live in Boston - double bonus.  I immediately ordered Alone on my Kindle and could not put it down.  Loved, loved, loved it and am on the hunt for more of her books.  My next stop was the library and just finished reading my third book and about to start another.  I love her writing and the research she puts into the book is just amazing.<br />Can't get enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Winifred McGranahan<br />New Hampshire
B00CJ32S74|5.0|I truly loved this album, Totally worth it! I have heard it over 20 tomes and I'm not tired of it!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Ever since you added the ad/video it's causing issues with game play. Some game plays you're beinging timed like in coop quest . You got to buy plants and each time the video pops up interrupting timed game play.  Plus the ads/ video are just plain annoying.  Please remove the ads/ videos.
B000WGWQG8|3.0|Always enjoy HBO series.  This one is of the caliber you would expect to find from HBO.  Found that it did begin to drag in a few spots but overall was nice series.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It is great to know how much battery you have left and not just a little bar. Also great to know how much longer it will take to charge.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Not as good as the first. Ramped up the action fast then seemed to slow down in the middle with another ramp up at the end. Overall a 3
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Good movie this was my first time watching a movie on Amazon. It never stopped or blurred. I enjoyed the experience.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Look, this product is in its baby stages.. I can stream ANYTHING I want from my laptop or desktop. Mobile devices will soon follow. Haters are going to hate people we all know that so do not worry about their opinions. My wife has an iPhone 5 I have a Samsung Galaxy III the kids have kindle fire HD's and I have an iPad Gen 2 and these ALL work with the Chromecast. There are a limited number of \\"apps\\" that come pre-loaded but there is going to be more, way more, being backed by Google. And for 35.00 how could you possibly go wrong? That's a third of what most people pay for cable a month. You obviously have to have a wireless network at home to use this device but all in all I rate this a 4.8 out of 5.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Great travel planner! I just planned a weeks vacation in a State Park complete with log cabin and hiking trails for my family. Trip Advisor provides names of places to stay, restaurants, and attractions in the area. Using the Reviews of the above, you can customize a trip to your needs. Trip Advisor is a great tool. Thanks!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Absolutely fantastic movie and New Zealander Karl Urban did a great job. Lot's of action. He plays Dr. McCoy on the new Star Trek J.J. Abrams series, but this movie will make you forget that role.<br /><br />Really a lot of action and cool technology. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B000002L68|5.0|In great condition, no scratches, cracks, or even finger prints on the CD, case, or the paper inside. Wonderful music, you won't regret purchasing.
0345529057|5.0|Enjoyed the series and really love the books.  Not finished with all 4 but so far love the fantasy and adventure.
1843440717|5.0|The quality of this product amazed me! It was in mint condition, absolutely no bends or anything--which sounds dumb, but you'd be surprised by how many books I've bought that came messed up somehow. The only con of this book is the print--very, very small, but other than that, it's hands down the best thing I've bought off of Amazon.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's an enjoyable read with some uniqueness all it's own despite some common post-apocalyptic traits. I'd recommend it to any sci-fi fan.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's nice to have it at your finger tip.enjoy keeping in touch with family and friends.adding pics is very easy
B002DQLGHU|5.0|It was a good movie, the original Harry potter was a good story and domble door was alive in that one.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|very contraversial feelings and thoughts!your read this book and think &#34;ok, now all is clear&#34; and all a sudden everything change to opposite- good hero becomes bad and vise versa!  and dont expect classic happy end))
B00499QUK2|5.0|Great take on Sherlock Holmes. Entertaining, suspenseful, and at times halarious. Benedict plays a great Holmes while his supporting cast and story only makes it better. Each episode is almost like a separate movie.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|I returned the item because it put out a mono, not a stereo signal, so was useless for converting my stereo cassette tapes. This was a hardware, not a software problem. I don't know whether all the units are mono only, or whether this was a problem just with my unit. As others have said, the hardware is rather flimsy, but it was the mono only that was the deal breaker for me.

B00D3PYQT0|5.0|This DVD set is a real treat as it includes all 25 episodes from Series 1-3. There are seven episodes from the first series, eight each from the second and third, plus the 2011 Christmas special which was arguably the best single episode so far; it was certainly one of the most dramatic! The less impressive 2012 Christmas Special is also included to round off Season 3.<br /><br />The three series so far have taken us from 1912, just after the sinking of the Titanic, up to 1920. The circumstances surrounding each series have been in contrast with each other. The first series ran up to the start of the First World War, and the one of the main thrusts of the story line was the matchmaking within the Crawley family and the various financial and social influences on the choice of a suitable partner.<br /><br />The second series moves on to the war years, when Downton Abbey had been converted into a convalescent home for injured servicemen. The time setting is from the Battle of the Somme up to the end of the war. This background contributes to some very interesting scripts, and whilst some felt that it did not live up to the first series, personally I thought it was excellent, but different.<br /><br />The Christmas special and the third series take place from late 1919 into 1920. The first features a very dramatic trial, and in the third series the household is far more back to the life of an aristocratic family as it was in the first series although the estate faces major challenges in the post war period and a need to embrace change if Downton is to survive. A major feature of the show is the interaction between the family and those who serve them `below stairs' and there are many strong performances amongst both groups. However, a review of Downton would not be complete without mention of Maggie Smith who, as Violet has some very funny lines and dominates every scene she is in. Shirley Maclaine was introduced in the third series, presumably as a foil to Violet, and the rather frosty relationship between the two worked very well. The 2012 Christmas Special takes us to 1921.<br /><br />I am sure that there will be few viewers who have not seen Downton, which is the most successful costume drama since Brideshead Revisited some thirty years ago. However if there are any out there this will be an excellent introduction to the show for them. Even if, like me, you have seen every episode to date you will enjoy revisiting them. We now know that there will be both a Series 4 and another Christmas Special to look forward to.<br /><br />However, this will not be the definitive box set for long as at the time of writing Series 4 is about to air in the UK.  It picks up just three months after the end of Series 3 - regular viewers will be interested to know that the producers have promised no further tragic deaths, at least for a while!he rather frosty relationship between the two worked very well.

But her songs are fun and catchy, her vocals have nice tone and there are some fun guitar parts too.<br /><br />Check out her videos on her YouTube channel.  If you like those, you have a good idea of what to expect.

B005JLN9Z8|5.0|I love Steel Panther!  What can I say?  I'm a degenerate.  They're vulgar and sexist and I can't get enough of their songs.<br /><br />Like \\"Feel The Steel\\", this is more of the same: great 80s-ish hair band rock with more modern-sounding production.  But they continue to find new and funny lyrics / vocals with an awesome backing band and killer guitar solos.<br /><br />\\"Tiger Woods\\" is great musically and production-wise, almost Journey-esque.  \\"If You Really, Really, Really Love Me\\" and \\"I Like Drugs\\" are probably my favorites lyrically.  Very catchy.  I had an idea for a band along similar lines but I really doubt I could write lyrics nearly as good as Steel Panther's.  They're simply hilarious.<br /><br />I really hope to catch them live some day.  I bet it would be a blast.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|What an amazing toy! It is so much fun to play with! It is a good brain workout and can help strengthen it by memorizing the places where the marble went last and using that to improve your time. It is also very well built. I would definitely recommend it!
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|Steel Panther might be a parody band, but they made just about the best tribute to the excess of the 80's ever.  Great songs, very easy to sing along with, grooving / slamming feel and cool shreddy solos.  And they do a great job stealing the feel of different bands like Poison and Bon Jovi, especially vocals-wise.<br /><br />And it's very, very funny.  The lyrics are hilarious.  I LOL at work and I have most of the lyrics memorized. I'm probably going to get fired for offending someone while signing along.  Even the CD's insert is funny.<br /><br />Great job, SP!<br /><br />(The follow up &#34;Balls Out&#34; is great, too.)

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Great movie. It shows how we, as a society, have lost touch with where our food comes from. And it turns out that many aspects of our food industry are unappetizing.
B0035Q4AFC|4.0|It provides a view of old hollywood.  I would recommend it too a friend.  It is hard to tell how factual it is.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I saw this in the theater and was happy to purchase it on DVD. The movie is based on the true story of the Bondurant brothers-Virginia moonshiners.  It's a bit violent and gory, but it's very well acted and a compelling story.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|When I got it on my kindle fire hd 7 months ago it was easy to use but questionable for accuracy. Now I have trouble learning it and don't like the gift point thing. The 24 hours updates are more accurate than before, but the game stuff to gain points for gift cards is irritating.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|I called this a woodsman's knife for a reason. If your P.O.U. (philosophy of use) for this knife is to go camping and survive a trip in the woods with only one knife this knife would be an excellent choice. If you need to include combat capabilities then there are better choices. The weight of this knife is both a benefit and a detractor to its use. For backpacking it's weight is an issue. For chopping down a 12 ft diameter redwood this is the only knife that has a chance at it. I am kidding but if you expect to need to build a shelter, raft, baton and chop tons of wood this is your knife as it excels at this type of work. I liken it to a mini machete. It lacks a little in the point and is too thick for detail work. It is too heavy to use as a spear point unless you use a log for a spear and way too heavy for combat unless you are built like a weight lifter.<br /><br />The quality of this knife is excellent and I mean excellent. The edge out of the box for me was good enough to get a good shave with. No need to grow a beard while being marooned in the woods. The price makes it worth buying and if I have it around and need to baton or chop it is my go to knife hands down.

I photograph from an ATV regularly and I also love to fish and photograph.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great read! A good ending to the series. Even though it seemed like Collins ended it without much ado or explaination.
B00338QENI|5.0|As a tribute to Henrietta Lacks everyone should read The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.  We owe her so much for her contributions to medical science.  The author does a superb job blending history and biographical works together. A word of caution...you won't be able to put it down once you begin. A book I will never forget.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey has great storylines and great characters. It's so rich and dramatic.  I can't wait for the new season to begin.
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|what a page-turner! loved every bit of it, every time I thought I knew who killed the Days there would be another twist waiting around the corner, and every chapter ended with a cliffhanger. thoroughly enjoyed Dark Places, would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality crime thriller. What's good about this book is that in the end all pieces of the puzzle fit so nicely together, no loose ends, just flawless. I thought Gone Girl was pretty clever, but Dark Places is now my favourite, can't wait to read the rest of G.Flynn's creations!
B003477DVK|4.0|Great coming of age story! Very cute! I Highly recommend it for families! My kids age eleven and eight were both very interested and entertained!
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I know that this is a contentious movie and I did not see it until it was on DVD because the trailer made me believe the spectacle would be amazing.<br /><br />Now I digress a moment to set the tone.<br />The primary need for the consumers of any story is internal consistency of the Rules of that Universe.<br /><br />A writer basically tells what is possible and not within the story. They are then obligated to the reader, listener, audience, from then on to remain faithful to those rules they have established for the story. No matter what kind of genre they are writing this one Rule never varies. The reason it is a Rule is because it is how the audience understands the tension of situations. Say you have aardvarks and they have spaceships. If you show the aardvarks outside the ship without any sort of protection on you are telling your audience that these aardvarks dont need the protection to function in space in this Universe. If you then later attempt to build tension by having your aardvark hero shot out of an airlock the audience will not see the dilemma because they know that the hero can and has survived in space without protection before.<br />The writers of this movie fail at this, horrendously. Rules change to suite the whim of the writer leaving a confusing mash of action vignettes strung together without the consistency of a good story. The reason I bring this up in such detail is because to use the name Star Trek you are accepting the Rules within THAT Universe for your story. The name is shorthand for everything previously established. The writers of this film are very poor at writing stories. They have no consistency, even just within the movie, let alone beyond it. One writer who was called on the carpet actually went on twitter (no names) to lash out at his critics and bash fans. His most telling rant though was something like, \\"there is a reason that some people write movies and others dont.\\" I expect he was implying that you must have a certain rare and non-questionable skill to be such a writer. I can think of dozens movies just in the past few years that clearly establish that for writing movies and television it is definitely not what you do but who you know that gets you the job.<br /><br />Im not one of those that think movies are much worse than in the past. Having seen hundreds if not a couple of thousand movies even, I can say that 80% of all movies in any year have been mostly crap. Sometimes its the writing, others the acting, or the director mad a mess of the plotting or direction. some are enjoyable with your brain turned off but most all are easily forgotten. Classics are movies NOT forgotten and maybe one a year, if even that, is rare to fall into this category. i personally believe that in 20 years Star Trek will still be enjoyed but these two \\"reboots\\" will be an embarrassing joke to the rest.<br /><br />I will say though that as a movie removed of any history and keeping your expectations low even if the names had all been changed it is a fun ride.<br />As Star Trek, though, it is a painful experience. I wanted to like it on even a basic action, explosions, humorous quips, level but it failed to keep me interested with its completely awful writing; the dialog was painful and some of the situation completely unbelievable with what you had been told earlier.<br /><br />Abrams is well documented for ignoring anything in a story except spectacle and shock. Its in poorly written and paced television and in his poorly written movies.<br />I have absolutely no idea why anyone would still let him make a movie, except perhaps that his name is well known. And just like M. Night Shamalamadindong he will inevitably fail one time too many. and his fans will abandon him, justly.<br /><br />If it were on a channel as I was surfing through I might leave it on but dont buy it and believe you are getting value.<br />Others have spoken about the awful packaging that Paramount has done to wring every last pennyfrom this poorly treated franchise. That in itself is a shame. It would be like inheriting the Hope Diamond and then having it breaking it down, advertising, \\"BUY A PIECE OF THE HOPE DIAMOND !\\" just to make squeeze the extra few dollars from its name recognition.<br />I will lastly say (is anyone actually still reading this?) That I dont like the \\"reboot\\" of famous franchises in general because they really have little integrity to stand on by their own merits. Casablanca was actually made 3 times, the other 2 the same year as the 1 with Bogart and Becall. Only the Bogart/ Becall movie is remembered because everything came together in that film where the others didnt. Could a retelling add anything new to it? Very doubtful. Reboots are an ego trip, a self stroking of the Producer/Director to put his own stamp to something that came before. Comic books movies are an exception to this, in my personal opinion, because comic books are pretty much rebooted every time their is a new writer on board anyway. They recreate the origin with some variant and try to refashion the character to their own fanboy obsession with it. Whats funny to me is that except for a rare few, almost all the comic book reboots actually look identical, maybe a place name of an angle is adjusted. Why does Batman, or Superman need an origin story every single time its remade. We get it, we know, its the same thing for 2/3 of the movie followed by whatever minor variation of the villain is attached. To me most of the directors of reboots just have nothing relevant to say and so slap a reboot together.<br /><br />Okay, Im done now. Thanks for reading (the hushed silence of an empty room).<br /><br />Post Script Edit: One final word. I said at the beginning that my review may be contentious, however, this is my personal opinion.<br />If you dont like my opinion then you are free to ignore it.<br />You are also free to leave and go write your own review.<br />you are not free to be a troll and flame thecomments section. they will be deleted and you will be ignored.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Solid album by the Elements, I bought the Target version as it contains 2 extra tracks which are very good and I was happy to say that I had to go to 2 different Target as they were sold out! Philip carries this album and he also sings with his son which seem's like he will carry the torch once Philip is gone. NTF is music to sit back relax and enjoy the musical journey! Overall it's a good R&B album you can never replace the 70's or 80's and must live now and appreciate this Legendary band who has given us so many great hits!  WIth all the current overhyped music today, it's refreshing and satisfying to see EWF still around doing there thing!
B000PMG16U|5.0|I ordered these movies for my son who used his saved-up allowance for them.  I bought them &#34;like new&#34; and you'd never know they weren't.  The shipping was quick.  The packaging was great.  The movies play with no issue.<br /><br />All around, a great purchase.  Will go through this seller again if the need arises.
B006WVVA28|3.0|When it works, it is great.<br />When it works...<br /><br />I had it running for about a year in a homebuilt system with an ASRock X79 Extreme 4 board. Started having random crashes and eventually the system would not boot. Went with a new motherboard, this time an ASUS PX79 LE board. That setup ran for about a month before problems began. Returned the board for a new one with same problem (no POST). Took everything to the repair shop and they determined the problem was with the CPU so sent it to Intel. Intel, to their credit, found it faulty and replaced it. Shop installed it and the motherboard was determined to be faulty as well. Retunred the motherboard and replaced it with a Sabertooth X79 only to have the same no POST problem. Many people have had problems with this processor and early versions of BIOS. Be aware that you may have to go through some extra steps to get your system running. I will have to take everything back to the shop, again, for them to diagnose the problem. Perhaps the CPU killed the motherboard? Perhaps the PX79 killed the CPU, then killed the replacement CPU? Annoying problem in any case.
0321934318|5.0|As a photographer, it explains how to do so many enhancements that I want to do to my photos.  If I forget how to do it, I can access the chapter to remind me just how to do it.<br /><br />Easy to use.  It is to the point.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love family sagas and learned so much about the wars.  Can not wait for part 3.  I really enjoyed the book.<br />Marjorielieder
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I'll be reading a lot more of this author.  I can usually predict plot twists but this one really fooled me.  Great read.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|The Snowman was well written and enjoyable. Nesbo kept the tension until the end. Quite thrilling.I will probably read another Harry Hole though this is not quite my preferred genre.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Hard to watch just one episode.<br /><br />Interesting point is that almost every character's hairstyle changed overnight between Season 1 and Season 2, although only one day supposedly passed. Hmmmm.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Nice challenge without being too hard. Would prefer puzzles with a 20 x 20 grid. Also colored grids would be fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. It is very challenging and fun. There are a few rooms that can be a bit difficult, but you  have a great sense of accomplishment when you complete the puzzles.
B009ZM76J2|5.0|Story about young sisters trying to beat the stupidity of white rullers by walking 1,000 miles across australia to reunite with their mother. Great movie showing the difficulty living in the wilderness away from tho coast.
B001F6ZIXC|2.0|Just recently started my own business and have lots of time on my hands. Never had time for TV series when employed full time, so now I decided to catch up. I have just recently watched the complete series of 24 and prison break which was fascinating, edge of your seat, fast paced, multiple twists shows which kept me sometimes till 4am. Based on reviews I decided to try this, but lost all interests by episode 7 of the first season. It just seems to drag on, lots of drama and dialogue, predictable. Some people might enjoy this but I prefer the likes of 24 and prison break. I'm going to give 'Breaking bad' a chance now, see how that goes.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This has always been one of my very favorite musicals! Love Julie Andrews voice! As a matter of fact I always wanted to follow in her footsteps! Especially enjoyed the extra DVD! There, Julie, Christopher and the  children talk about their mistakes which did or did not get cut from the final take, hardships they had to deal with or even childhood crushes. IT WAS WONDERFUL! Diana M.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|I keep thinking that at some point Arctic Monkeys HAVE to disappoint me, but it hasn't happened yet. This album is striking and catchy and I love it. In my opinion, it's got a bit of an old-Western twang to some of its songs, like you're in a saloon.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|matt smith has captured me, heart and soul. season six is fantastic. Curse of the Black Spot and The Girl Who Waited were sorta not good episodes at all but then A Good Man Goes to War is incredible and everything leads up to a really amazing finale with the last episode. masterfully written, gorgeous doctor, i wish the tardis would appear in my living room and whisk me away.
B005D0TETA|5.0|Its another way to enjoy the music of yes.  The orchestra makes the music fuller at times.  It was also just fun watching the orchestra have fun doing the music.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|i fell in love with this silly movie years ago im so happy it is out on dvd to buy now , cause now i have it on VHS and DVD =)
B000JIN3J8|4.0|I love this.  Bringing Jane Austen's words to life in a new and refreshing way.  Great actors and actresses.  Nice scenery
B0098460O4|5.0|I tried to find this in London last year when we were on vacation there for a couple of days, but they were all sold out at the stores I tried, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.com.  Just love it.  They have beautiful voices that complement each other.  They have a great future in music.  I would buy their next CD.  Wish they would come to Florida and perform!  Love to see them in person.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|So much hard data to convince me to start eating this way.  Not so much a &#34;diet&#34; as a way of living. I am now eating 5 days a week and fasting ( eating minimally - 500 calories) on Monday and Thursday. I am losing weight and enjoying my food consumption more. As a &#34;Foodie&#34; I love eating delicious food and wine, but I also want and need to stay at a healthy weight. This gives me the freedom to do that. I am losing weight and getting back to what I always considered my normal weight, when I was in my thirties when my weight never varied much. I still have a way to go to get my weight back to that but it is dropping. I have been eating and fasting for a month and a half. I have lost over 10 lbs.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|One of the greatest.. Too bad the young kid who played the villain had to be taken so early in life. Don't know why Amazon wants me to review this item when I just ordered it yesterday and haven't received it but anyway I just wanted it in my collection.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Easiest to use email.  Have been using Yahoo mail for many years and am satisfied with it. Enjoy it, y'all.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Unusual characters, clever plots, interesting historical details of life in the 1890s. Everyone must know this book -- a true classic.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great novel, filled with wonderful twists, believable and flawed characters.  Can't wait to read her other books. Fabulous ending
B00942Y4IY|2.0|It held my interest but barely. This movie had a Corny plot and ending!  I personally would not view it again.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Terrible. Plot is mediocre. There are so many holes in it. It is hard to tell who from who, since all the identifying markers are gloomy and not always visible.
1932907009|4.0|Read this book very slowly and take it in because the experience shared is good. The author makes no promise that you'll make a sale but the contents will help you think about the business of making movies and the system that exists. That framework has helped me hone a few good story ideas into pages that are read by people who make decisions and cut checks. Though it's not the last book on screenwriting I'll buy, it is a good addition to my tool box.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|I am not worthy to give any sort of review of this.  I am humbled by the story, the plot, the Matt Damon's performance.  Enough said.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great season! So happy I started watching this show. If you like court drama, politics and a splash of mystery then this is it!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  People kept mentioning it me but just recently picked it up and I really enjoyed it.  Makes a lot of sense especially since I counsel people with their relationships.  I found it to be very true.  The stories were great because it helped you to understand the dynamics in that particular couple.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Michelle williams is one of Hollywood's most under-rated talents...She is-as always -brilliant in this. She is petite-in comparison to marilyn...but the production worked with that-and it is about capturing essence-which she does....the film is well written and directed as well....worth a view
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|A good start to bringing the halo universe to life. Despite being free to watch upon release, this short film proves to be a lot more than just that. With good sets, believable CGI, decent actors, and story that focuses on character development, I was glad to see the halo universe turned into something other than mindless explosions and one-liners. Worth the watch!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I am following several sports teams and celebrities.  When I tweet to say &#34;good game&#34; or &#34;excellent performance&#34;, etc., I go to their profile and look at their tweets, but don't see the tweet I sent.  I thought Twitter was a means to communicate thoughts to others, like celebrities, as a fan, and, if you're lucky your might get an acknowledgement from them.  But then I read in &#34;Help&#34; that unless your are being followed by someone, they will not receive your message.  This seems dumb, a celebrity would have to acknowledge all the thousands of fans who send them tweets, and that's not going to happen.  And yet when you look at their tweets you see tweets from obviously normal fans who, sometimes, have had a response from the celebrity.  I am confused.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Really enjoyed this game. Stopped playing at level 8 since this is where either I got stuck or there is a glitch. So I stopped and played Can You Escape and completed those 10 levels. Now I'm here again. So I maybe doing a spoiler alert but I want to complete this level. What's the deal with the books in the bookshelf below the big picture? And the dot in the wall behind the bookcase? Cant use key. Trying to get this last gear.<br />Going  to scroll through reviews to see if anyone posted anything about it but other than this glitch, I've enjoyed it.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Works solid and hardly any issues. However, I'll stick to my default Android keyboard for now. Overall still one of the better keyboards but cannot top the Google default in my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed playing. Some required more thinking but finally made it to level ten on second day from downloading. Glad ads were not too much in the way of gameplay. Would love to receive more levels.
0385523394|5.0|After watching the show, I had to get the real deal. I enjoyed it much more than the fiction, as is usually the case. Read the whole thing in one sitting.
0060254920|5.0|My children read this book 30 + years ago and I have bought 3 to give to motheres-to-be at their baby showers.  It is a great classic that kids love to read over and over again.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|These young actors do such a wonderful job of recreating the characters I used to enjoy watching on the TV series.  This development of the back-story to the series is very entertaining.  Worth the watch!
B007SGM084|5.0|This story is the best love story I have ever read!!! Beautifully done and can't wait for more!!!! Love it!!!
B008TRH5N6|5.0|The reading is a little hard to get into at first as it appears this book didn't have a very good editor.  But the content overall was amazing.  Little changes can be made in your thinking to make huge results in your life! Highly recommend this book.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Well, it's a really great movie and I just loved the bonus features. I'm well aware it's not the Star Trek in the &#34;traditional&#34; sense but, that's ultimately what I love about it. A non-stop roller-coaster high-octane punch in the teeth that makes you grow some chest hairs. That's what this movie is. Even gorgeous ladies love this movie so fellas (don't be afraid to introduce your lady to a little sci-fi)!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Enjoyable fun watching the antics of a minion in a rush. You can even poke and tickle them before you even start.
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|I've been a fan of Queensryche since about 1983. The album is good, not great. I hear elements of the old Queensryche and I do like Todd La Torre's voice. I particularly did not like the length. 11 songs and still only 35 minutes? That wasn't acceptable back in the days of vinyl let alone now. There should have been a couple more tracks on this album or they should have made the existing songs longer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun, because it is challenging and exciting. I like how you can connect it to Facebook, because you can rub it in people's faces when you beat their high score! It is very fun collecting different power ups, and jumping over trains! I would recommend to all!
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|This movie is really scary, and its better to watch it alone in the dark. but the only thing that i dont like about this movie, is the end, so predictable just like the other ones.  happy ending.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing the game......but,there are too many ads. I have also had problems with it freezing up. It is easily remedied but very annoying having to delete and redownload.
B00AEFY08O|5.0|Very good got what I wanted. Forest gump is one of those amazing movies that u can watch all day every day
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This app is amazing perfect for people who like puzzles. If you want to try the computer version GO to coolant and also HEY guys sky here
B00A81NFAS|2.0|I have seen the movie, and the movie is great, I loved it. But it's says u get blu ray and DVD. I only got blu ray
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is really good game I play it a lot and  it is great for little kids to I recommend this game to everyone:)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have fun playing this game because it is fun and it it fun because it is fun and I like having fun
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|One,of my favorite apps, does what it says all the time. The only problem is mine. When I clean sometimes I,not careful enough and,some times deletes some of my apps. I know,to watch my s d card.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Quite challenging. Fun.  Too short. I've played 100 escapes, Can you escape, and you must escape as well as 100 floors.  This was among the easier and the shorter...never had to cheat. I'm a 32 yr old woman.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's great, just what you expect from the trilogy. Full of twist and turns and heartbreak. Will reread more than once.
159463176X|5.0|What a heartbreaker this story is. It runs the gamut of all the emotions we can experience. This is master storytelling at its finest weaving its way through the decades. Other reviewers have done a good job of laying out a basic outline, but this has to be read to be experienced. Enough said. Of a different genre, I also highly recommend Lin Tomasso's Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered. Great advice mixed with personal experience. It's the funniest book on prayer you'll ever read. The author is very down to earth, no professional Christianity. I got a download for $2.99 (for any device, even your laptop) at Smashwords.com. Bet you'll enjoy it. Great books, both. Totally different, but wonderful.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Loved these peel and stick stickers was able to transform her whole room very happy with size of stickers and the quality
0399159347|5.0|Oh, my - where to begin. This is a classic tale of how a life can seem solid, fall apart, and cruise down some very unexpected roads. Underlying wit thrown in here and there will make you smile while this seemingly destroyed life attempts to resurrect itself. It's a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the heart of a great woman. I also highly recommend a book which took me by surprise, Lin Tomasso's Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered. Great advice mixed with personal experience. It's the funniest book on prayer you'll ever read. The author is very down to earth, no professional Christianity. I got a download for $2.99 (for any device, even your laptop) at Smashwords.com. Bet you'll enjoy it. Two really good books here.
B00821OX98|5.0|As a mom, Falling Skies is a great show to watch with your teenage boys and still enjoy yourself. Seems to entertain everyone!
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|First time I saw the Riddick series and this was the best movie ever. Will probably watch it again but might buy it as it is too good not to own.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What else is there to say except it is delightful and among my all-time favorite shows of all time.  Love it!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Love Actually is a nice melding of 9 different romantic comedy stories excellently done! They are funny, moving, sad, romantic, touching and all so very richly told. You care very much for all the characters that are brilliantly played by top notch actors like Bill Nighy, Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, etc. I am convinced that this top level talent is a key ingredient to the great flow of the movie and the great success of the equally top notch writing and direction by Richard Curtis. Even after over 20 viewings this movie remains fresh and hugely entertaining.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|To a great saga. No less no more this is one of the most riveting endings to a series I've read in a while
B004GCK6XY|5.0|This story by Richard Curtis is a wonderfully entertaining romantic comedy. I have watched this movie probably more than 15 times and it remains magical. Hugh Grant is simply excellent here and the chemistry between him and Julia Roberts works perfectly. The Blu-ray transfer is super particularly with the 1080P high definition picture. It was very much worth upgrading to this from my DVD version.
0307454568|5.0|I read this book while suspended in a hammock from two bamboo poles deep in the Ecuadorian jungle.  I read this book from the House of The Spirits, which is the title of another book by Isabelle Allende, but I digress.  Bats flew overhead, insects flew in my face, the place got dark at 6:30 and was pitch black by 8pm.  I had no electricity, only an albino bat hanging from the ceiling and lots of insects buzzing around all the time but this book kept me going, and gave me something to look forward to every evening that arrived.<br /><br />Five stars.  Rick says check it out.
B0081HLMD8|4.0|What a surprise thriller. A simple story that starts as theft but spirals into something much larger with twists and turns that are unanticipated. Excellent acting and direction. I highly recommend this movie it was really quite entertaining.
1573226521|3.0|While I generally enjoyed reading The Beach, what I realize in hindsight is that he chose to jam too much time and feeling into such a short passage.<br /><br />I would have liked to explore Kao San road a bit more.  I would have liked to have known what it was like for the dreamers on The Beach when they were relaxed and dreaming, and not running from their own, often falsely created, paranoia.<br /><br />I give this book three stars, and suggest you check it out in your free time, but whether you check it out or not, life will go on.<br /><br />RR
B000V5Y1SQ|3.0|The first season was interesting and the development of the characters was well done. In my opinion the weakest member of the cast was Avery Brooks who simply doesn't come across as believable and often sounds like an actor reading his lines (and not that well). However the rest of the cast make up for this singular shortfall.
B003UPPO2G|4.0|This was a pretty cool concert especially in light of the fact that 2 of the 3 Gibbs brothers have now passed on.<br /><br />I would reccomend this to anyone who likes disco or late 1970s pop music as that was really their heyday. And yes, I know they had some hits in the 1960's.<br /><br />Sound was pretty good and picture was very good.<br /><br />Recommended - I would give this a very solid 4 out of 5 stars.
B005HSL626|5.0|My four years old kid loves this game. Really easy to play and full of fun for one or two.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a MUST read for everyone!!!  True account of Real American HEROES!!  I loved this book because when you think hero, you read about four awesome Navy SEALS who truly are! And their brothers in arms who risk everything for them!!
B005ZMTXMY|4.0|This movie is well made.  I found it extremely depressing at times as they deal with the passing of the man's wife.  I understand how it is crucial to the plot of the movie, but there had to be another way to write this where the viewer didn't feel bad right off the bat.  I guess they should be commended for creating a movie that was able to express a gambit of emotions.  I will still watch it over and over, just knowing to keep some Kleenex close by.
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best books I have read in years.  Hard to put down. I would suggest couples reading the book together
B007ZYCQ9C|5.0|As a native Bostonian who grew up with this book, I had shared it (along with the duckling statues in Boston Garden with my own children and now grandchildren, and I was eager to pass it along to the new baby of a close friend.
B0002HWQEE|5.0|This is a very well made, sturdy, small doggie who comes with us on most of our trips, and is a favorite \\"companion\\" at home. My daughter started pulling him as soon as she could walk, and still enjoys the cute dog. It is very well made, and will be a pass-on toy for sure.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Enduring romance and beautiful location shots.  The chemistry between Hawke and Delpey is enchanting and touching.  Eager, now, to see the third installment.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading it and found it entertaining.  I was able to picture each of the characters which for me makes the book seem to come alive.
B001NA6096|5.0|We had seen reviews of Before Midnight in local papers, which urged us to watch the first two films in the trilogy.  We are so glad we did!  Unfortunately, by the time we watched them both, Before Midnight was out of the local theater, so now we are awaiting Amazon's availability of #3.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|It seemed a bit slower paced to me than City of Bones.  It took longer for me to read since it didn't grab me like the first one did.
0316010669|2.0|Gladwell really does have a knack in telling stories. But very often I am skeptical about the relevancy of given anecdotes. For instance, in one occasion he talked about the impact of coercing African-American people to naming their race and exam performance. This is indeed a fascinating example but I am doubtful that it carries the necessary element in supporting the main thesis of the book. There are numerous of such examples where after you read certain stories, you are like `What is the point of telling such story in relation to the thesis?', even if the anecdote does prove a point, it is certainly not an exclusive one. Or in other words, outcomes in a story can be explained in so many legitimate ways. An obvious example of such is surely chapter four. The author's explanation is just one of the many. This to me has seriously made Gladwell's argument weak and unconvincing<br />.<br />Another criticism that I have on this book is the ability of the author to summarize. As I turn the pages, I have this expectation that the author will conclude his argument somewhere along the chapter. Unfortunately, that did not happen very often. This gave me the impression that author is simply accumulating evidence without seriously addressing the significance of it. That is also the reason why I have so many question written on the margin of the book. Many of them are due to the negligence of the author in simpler and obvious counter-arguments or explanations.<br /><br />Finally, I am dubious about the main thesis of the book. The book teaches us that about `thin-slicing' and how it influences our ability to come up with conclusions in the first few seconds when we see something. This thesis is rather uncontroversial to me. To me, majority of the book is trying to prove a rather incontrovertible and straightforward point. It could be me that is the one that is ignorant and stupid but I genuinely did not gain much in reading this book. That is also why after I finished the bookI had feelings of emptiness and unsatisfied. My brain is thinking `hmm, is that it? Is that the end of the book?' It is also noteworthy that I like to read with a pen in my hand. I like to underline important lines which reader tries to infer. But in this book I could hardly underline anything!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Ive played this on the computer, and wanted it for my kindle, but knew  it wasn't worth 0.99, so I held out. So glad its free. Great game, good sandbox, can play it for a while.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game n I love the newest update I think it's cool that they incorporated part2 the movie into the game hopefully the evil minions are in it to I just love everything about it it's fun should add more things make game longer =) 10/10
B009NY43NY|5.0|Thi book is a little less about the vampires, but I love it. I love the entire  series and am looking forward to the &#34;cath up&#34; book to the series where Ms. Harris will catch us up with all of the characters due out in October. I would highly recommend not only this book but th whole Sookie Stackhouse series.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|LOVED this, and I don't like the original story. Enjoyed the special effects, loved Depp's take on the character.  Have candy on hand, though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. By far the best book I have ever read. And trust me, I've read A LOT. I highly recommend you read this book. You won't regret it.
B0002234LS|5.0|I just like this movie.  I recommend it to all Stephen King fans.  I'm a Depp fan, but the rest of the cast is marvelous too.  Very scary.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can not believe the ending!  Really wished I lived in the UK so that I could see it way sooner than we will in the US!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|horrible movie, I hated it from the beginning to the end. Not a kid movie..too scary for a younger audience.
0061537969|5.0|If you're a dog lover and are looking for a heart-wrenching story, this is the book for you!  Such a worthwhile read!  I read this book in about 2.5 days
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Not bad but not one of the best.  This was a early novel that slipped by.  I'll still eagerly await new novels.
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|I love this movie!  It is such a psychological thriller that I find more interesting that most &#34;horror&#34; movies that come out today.
B00EEXST2K|5.0|Acting, direction, script...really interesting in that the first half of the film depicts one perspective of this time period and of Linda Lovelace's experience, and the second half portrays the same events through quite a different -- and far darker, brutal -- lens.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|I like playing this kind of games but I can't get any help it I'm stuck.  At this time time I'm stuck and can't go any farther.
B005PR422K|5.0|I can be pretty hard on business books, most of which are an article stretched to a book. But this is excellent - and a great lesson on the value of small incremental change - one small and manageabvle change at a time, lock it in, measure the effect, move to the next one. I'm sold.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Perfect as an alarm clock. It always goes off on time, the weather is accurate (or... more accurate than the weatherman), and I like the selection of alarm noise. Also, it's nice that the alarm will go off when you aren't in the app. It's great for time management.
B009A9SULS|5.0|It's such a nice little eReader. Fits in any pocket or purse, and works great.  You do have to sync it yourself when you've added books.  Reading from other Kobo devices or the PC Kobo desktop app all sync well together with it, so you are always on the page where you left off.  Love having this little simple reader.  Love kindle and nook, but this is a nice addition, too.  Not as many Free books as Kindle, but it's wonderful.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Interesting game play, but  the  story is what keeps me going. Good graphics also doesn't hurt. Good game for any beginners.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Awesome...Job well done again...real music...must have album...you will not be disappointed at all...I totally recommend for everyone to get this
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits is funny, has creative story lines & is well written. The cast is talented + they have an amazing on air chemistry. Can hardly wait for season 4.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I did not know that Grisham wrote for teens. I wish I had a teen to recommend this book to. I will not be reading any more of the series.
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|My 3 year old daughter loves that all the princesses.  They come with gems too, which are cute, but if your child takes them off the wall they don't stick back on as well- and I have also found them around our house.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This would have been great to hear by a campfire. Very simplistic and repetitive, just not my cup of ta.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app helps so much when travelling.  You know what to pack and if a coat should be kept close,  in the car or carry on luggage.  Very good app...and it's free
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but glad I went to the theatre to see this offering from Matthew Vaughn. Casting is fun, and although there are some liberties with new mutants, it is great to see classic characters like Emma Frost, Havok and Banshee. Very clever introduction tying First Class to the first X film ... and there are two cool cameos!
B00F35BV64|5.0|at last I understand Star Trek 2 - The Wrath of Kahn. It was awesome it all make sense now, well at least for me, all the characters where made so excited to blend with the other movie characters. Like the movie and I promoted promote and encourage anybody to see it.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|First off I have been a Star Trek fan for many years. This movie satisfies most of the requirements of a good Star Trek film. The story is fresh with just enough backwards references for any long time fan. The characters are now more closely aligned with the original ones from all those years ago in both the TV series and films.<br /><br /> Now for the glitch. I was playing the Blu ray disc and had to stop the movie in the middle when something came up. When I went back to watch the rest the disc wanted to play from the beginning, which is normal. However, on my internet connected player I would only get one or two previews and the disc would go no further. I tried the disc in my older, not connected player, and the disc went right to the movie menu. I put the disc back in the other machine and turned off the internet connection and the disc went right to the menu and played fine. I do not care for the previews, but I could not get to the movie without disabling them.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|The worst movie I have seen in a long time. Why they made a remake of this I have no clue.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written, great acting, fun and eventful show! I love it! I bought Amazon Prime just to watch the show!
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|The last fight at the end was terrible but the movie was good. When I say terrible I mean corny. The movieis worth watching.
B00005S6K6|4.0|This movie is moving, touching, poignant and erotic in a very understated way. The scenes with Meryl and Robert heartbreakingly romantic and sweet and gentle. Watching their relationship move from easy friendship to profound love are exquisite. I admit I am a devout Meryl Street fan. This one touches my like few other movies have.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Wonderful story!! The author transcended a time and place that many  of us  are afraid to endure. Kudos!! The details are breathtaking
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|This game has a hilarious story line and is lots of fun to play.  New content is coming out all the time for game balance, seasonal content and for increasing the level cap.  Lots of fun to play by yourself through the campaign, or together with friends.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Absolutely love this show. Every episode is phenomenal & I'm eating it up like candy. Can't wait to see what happens in season 2. Bravo!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|1. Need inspiration to continue running?<br />2. Need not eat meat to excel in running, as vegetarian food can do the job!<br />Check & What?…..then read this book
B002M87V0A|5.0|Combining ultimate musical and terpsichorean entertainment with a wonderfully hopeful message: &#34;Kid, I always think there's a band&#34;, this movie ranks in my top 5 of all genre.
B0032W5H9C|5.0|One of my favorite movies, but I'm confused as to why Carey Mulligan is listed as a supporting actor when she's the main character?
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I purchased this Bluetooth for my daughter and son in law.  They have recently been transferred to NY complements of the Navy. The state of NY is a handsfree state for talking on the cell phone. Since they already a Prius that has Bluetooth they were accustomed to the handsfree car wide Bluetooth set up.  I purchased the car system over an individual system so there would never be an issue of \\"Who has the Bluetooth\\".  They received the system yesterday and were so pleased with their surprise.  They said the magnetic clip that holds the Bluetooth to the visor was very strong.  The system is much easier to set up with both of their phones.  Much easier than the Prius set up.  They stated how easy it was make calls with it.  When talking with both of them, I could actually here BOTH of them thru the Bluetooth system.  When asking if we needed to purchase this type of Bluetooth for the rest of our non Bluetooth vehicles, there response was YES !!!
B00EH49DXA|5.0|love pop\\". I love this song, heck I love any pop songs, I love any songs that pop artist \\"Katy Perry give to us!
B009MYARIK|1.0|Haven't read the book yet b u t won't let me proceed unless I review this book.  Do not know how to review this when haven't read I ye
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful and complex read. You both love and hate each character. Highly recommend and would definitely read another moriarty book.
030789701X|5.0|It does not matter if you have it for Xbox 360 or PS3 because this strategy covers both not that there are any differences in the games anyways. This strategy guide tells you everything literally everything about the game. I think that is all I really need to say to be honest.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I like Bubble witch a lot but it is frustrating and addicting but it is fun to play.There`s  no glitches. The first 5 or 6 levels  are easy.
B000OPOAM0|5.0|Any dvd copy of The Terminator is good enough to buy unless you are crazy about how the picture looks like if its slightly grainy or not but I could care less as long as I can see the movie I'm good to go. And as far as I know there are no extended, uncut, or unrated versions of the original Terminator so go ahead and buy which ever copy you come across.
B007SGM084|5.0|Believe it or not, I did, finally, get tired of all the sex scenes....but, enjoyed the characters and the love stories, along with the mysteries.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|A little harder to use on the kindle fire, but it could be me as I uze to have the full photo shop on the computer.  Would help if it had a better tutorial.  I am still trying to learn all the ins and outs of it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the best game ever I love sharks so all you shark lover's make shure you get this game!<br />Also some times it forgets your progress but other than that this game is AWESOME!!!
B00COH0W00|4.0|True Love always wins in this twist when two strangers meet, there connection with each other in a few hours that change there life. The only bad part of this Movie is her boyfriend, lousy, weird fellow. The rest of the Movie makes up for his bad part.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Okay, I'm past the time when I SHOULD be reading it, (I'm only 40!), but man, this is so good!  I only began it after reading the original,  which I read after watching the Hunger Games; and now I'm going crazy about the way that they're going to do it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I recently finished reading the series in its entirety... AGAIN. If you are not into romance, action, and above the top description, put it down. Fifty Shades of Grey is slow starting. The first 1/3 of the book is rather lulled and drags a little. It quickly heats up after that and has twists and turns all the way through the end. The author does use repeatition throughout the book and I wasn't crazy about the PG-13 terminology relating to the female anatomy when the male anatomy was very seductive. Beyond that, it is a steamy (to say the least) read. A perfect book for a woman who has been married a few years!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|One of the few US TV series with an anglicised sense of humour. For those who like Black Adder etc etc.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker is my favorite of the trilogy. At the end of the first book, your heart is in your stomach and broken. But the pieces are rather quickly (and thankfully) put back together and moved along. There is no lull in action and the steaminess just keeps going up and up! I'm not a literature major and I don't care how many times the author used the same word, it's a great damned book! I love how Charlie Tango is a character and so special to me as reader. I love this book! <3
B00DQVST76|1.0|Received my DVD yesterday. Put it in and the picture freezes and does not work! Audio continues, but picture does not! SO NOT HAPPY!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's good for free time it is so so so much fun for a FREE app<br />It's cool I LOVE it it's so fun
B00785P2QC|5.0|So far so good.... I like the fact that it keeps generating money for you even when you're not playing with it!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|love this game and u will 2<br /><br />om nom is adorable dont make him said though<br />it made me sad when he pulls a sad face
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book  - i laughed and cried (actually i sobbed). it was amazing and am recommending it to everyone
0553328255|5.0|I like the detective novels. I have read lots of Holmes in different editions, so I wanna buy it as a souvenir.
1400069289|5.0|Don't read it like a novel. Read a few pages, put it aside and think about what you read, then read some more. I find myself talking about this book everywhere I go.
B003B02PEU|4.0|Another great Grisham book. Many likeable characters. Good story. Thought I had it figured out but was happily wrong. Loved the small town, Southern setting.
B005VPRG10|5.0|Easy build instructions and result is impressive. They use some clever tricks to get it to fit together. Comes out the size you would expect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|really good game really needs update but thats cause its more of a pocket edition like its called get get get get get get get get get it
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|I was so happy to fianlly get to see this movie.  I'm so sorry I missed it while it was in the theaters as I would have loved to support it.<br />If you loved \\"Stand by Me\\", you'll love this movie.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It was an awesome book, couldn't put it down! I can't wait for the last book of the series to come out!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I totally love this game we become addicted quickly. It can be challenging at times and I become impatient waiting on my energy to refill. Just love this game!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is the best game of all the games . From the day that I got the game  I feel in love with the game  . This is the best game in the world you have to get the game.(:
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|A truly eyes opening representation of what Jesus did for us. The sacrifice he made for our sins, so we don't have to suffer in this life. I could bet all my belongings that anyone who now wears a cross as a trend, and watches this movie, will think twice about it. Or even better, wear it because they believe! This was a very difficult movie to watch but it is incredibly compelling. Highly recommended!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Wont run. Freezes , I downloaded couple of different times and never did work. So I uninstalled it. Went thru this 3 different times.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I first saw this movie about 30+ years ago and have loved it ever since. The story, the acting and the music all come together for laughs, tears and understanding. It's been called a 'cult classic' but to me it's just a classic; a wonderful and lovable classic. Enjoy &#60;3
B003G4W49C|5.0|A very clever and fast paced story that kept me hooked until the end. Can't wait to see the film.
B006T3RM08|4.0|I am using it right now. All switches work, it is light and does not add a lot of bulk. Only 1 complaint. It is not sturdy enough to use on my lap alone. There is just a slight flex that causes to touch pad to jamb. I sit it on a lap board like used for a lap top and it works perfectly.
B000EPR7NE|4.0|Hans Zimmer wrote a very effective and atmospheric soundtrack for this gem of a movie.  Half of the time the film is so engrossing that one doesn't even hear the music.  It works well in the film but not the greatest listening experience on its own.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Because I had not followed the show from the beginning, I needed to catch up on all 3 seasons. I was thrilled to find all 3 on amazon instant video.  The show is set in an era that is fascinating to me, and fun to watch.
0307271609|5.0|This book is a heavily researched biography of the Chinese Dowager Empress Cixi.  I knew next to nothing about this period of Chinese history so it was all a revelation to me.  Cixi was a powerful woman in a country where women had few rights yet she managed to exert a great deal of power mostly from behind the scenes.  In 1852 as a 16-year-old she was chosen to be one of the concubines of the emperor.  An emperor could have only one empress but as many concubines as he wished.  She fortunately got along very well with the Empress (who was not as politically astute as Cixi) but could not even discuss politics with the Emperor.  Then she had a son - and it turned out to be the Emperor's only surviving son.  According to custom the son was considered the child of the Empress but because the two women were close, Cixi stayed close to her son. The Emperor was weak and could not stand up to the rebellions and the stress ultimately killed him.  Cixi moved quickly to make her infant son the new emperor and herself and the Empress as dowager empresses with the real power.  It was a bold and very risky move.  If they had failed they would have died horrible deaths.  But she succeeded.  She was the power behind the throne (the Empress eventually died) until her son came of age.  She wanted to modernize China but it was a huge task.  She always held on to the fundamentals of Chinese Ming belief but was open to new ideas.  Her attempts to modernize impressed the west.  However, when her son came of age, she had to go back the to harem with no power.  He didn't last and in a series of complicated manipulations she put an adopted son on the throne.  Again, brilliant moves.  China was being attacked by many different Western and Asian powers so it was a time of great tension.  Her adopted son was weak and not interested in politics but when he came of age, she lost power again and China began a great slide as chunks were taken over by Japan, Russia and the western powers and Chinawas being bled by war reparations.<br /><br />I will not give away much more of the story.  It is fascinating.  The author (of Chinese birth) is determined to rehabilitate Cixi's image which was damaged by false reports for a hundred years.  This is not a story for the faint of heart as the times were brutal and Cixi, though basically kind, could assert powerful authority.  She was a wise woman (but made big mistakes during the Boxer rebellion, which she later publically acknowledged).  She tried hard to save her country from being carved up by Japan, Russian and the west.  Her adopted son (who would have favored turning China over to the Japanese) lived until a few days before Cixi herself died.  She apparently poisoned him to save China and move toward a constitutional monarchy.  However, the march of history around the second world war (Chiang Kai-shek, Mao) would change everything.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book to those who have any interest in history.<br /><br />Footnote:  This is a prepublication unedited proof but it reads fine.  However, one big thing is missing: the guide to the pictures.  There are lots of black and white pictures that are completely intriguing but they are not labeled and the list of illustrations is missing.  That is a big loss.  I assume the corrected version will take care of all that.
B004XWMXW4|2.0|Was rather disappointed in this cd.  Love cello music, but felt this cd did not meet my standard. Parts were ok, but wish I kept my money.
B00BY1F8UQ|4.0|Only at one small point in the music did the melody stutter .......... on the second track . But the line was quickly, and masterfully picked up and continued to flow .
6305692572|5.0|One of my favorites.  Andy Garcia  and Meg Ryan are great in this movie.  Consider it or of Ryan's best performances
0451419243|1.0|So... let me get this right, you actually think that by trying to charge $24 for an electronic file you are going to come out on top. Hmmm. I would have bought this book several months ago if it was priced in a manner that didn't make me want to vomit. I will NEVER pay this much for ANY Kindle book. You are really starting to get on my nerves, and I hope the courts step in and correct what is obviously monopolistic behavior...
B009VMN3RA|4.0|It starts out very good and interesting.  I had high hopes for Sachi that she would make good, redeem herself and have a happy ending; but sadly she eventually started sleeping around; living with guys; had an abortion; frolicked naked with colleagues at hot springs, did nude scenes which ruined any chance at a real acting career and then ends up divorced.  I'm not sure if she was this way as a result of her growing up, or if she just inherited those genes.  Very sad!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Star Trek: Into Darkness is a great movie. A sequel to 2009's Star Trek, Into Darkness is in some ways both a remake and a tribute to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. For me, it works on all levels. It's exciting, action-packed, clever, and highlights certain moral concerns and character relationships that are true to the legacy of this amazing franchise.<br /><br />The only reason to knock a star off of this rating is because of the product itself. I'm not huge on special features. In general, I just want to movie itself with high picture and sound quality. The only \\"special\\" thing I tend to go for is if there's a director's cut (like for Lord of the Rings and Watchmen, where the added material vastly improves the films). I rarely watch a commentary, and I'll watch little featurettes once, if at all.<br /><br />But this bizarre insult to fans, spreading features out through vendor-exclusive releases, which don't even necessarily have the features, like a commentary, available on a disc . . . that's just wrong. Truly, unambiguously wrong. For myself, I don't feel too affected. I wanted the movie, I love the movie, I like having both the blu-ray and dvd. For others, the completists out there, you're going to be angry and disappointed, and I don't blame you one bit. I felt the same way about the dvd sets for the tv shows, too, where there were no commentary tracks and minimal special features. I don't really need them, but I can totally see how others would feel shafted. If ever there were a franchise where the devoted fans deserve the best, it's Star Trek. It is a sad fact that Paramount seems only too eager to abuse those fans, just as the Star Wars fans have been taken advantage of for so many years.
1416914307|5.0|These books get better and better throughout the series after reading this one your going to HAVE to read the next
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Everyone from ages 5-40 in our family love this game more than any other running game. Top notch and I'm so glad they keep adding new levels. This game is free and does not take up to much space. Also the graphics are pretty awesome. Enjoy
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Gotta love it this app is amazing for girls who love pretty gowns and crowns princess are amazing to me
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very addicting! I really need to go do something constructive now....maybe I'll see how many brown bananas are in my freezer...
B001O8D47S|5.0|I didn't know what to expect of this movie after I had seen the 1939 original.  How could the recapture acting of that wonderful movie?  But, they did.  Almost similar plot update to the present; same characters.  Meg Ryan and the rest of the cast play their parts to perfection.  I saw the 1939 and 2008 movies almost back-to-back and was entertained by both.  I highly urge folks to get this and watch it.  It is the only movie I have ever seen that stars only women--they all deserved academy awards for this!
B0000669JL|4.0|Good purchase and made me appreciate what I've missed when I was younger. Talented musician who died too soon. Good to listen to especially on the road.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|very easy read but light weight plot , not see through, but not stretching the imagination, the finish almost suggested a sequel
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the three books and loved them.  Shared them with all my co-workers.  I thought Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect choice for Catniss.  The second time I watched it was with my elderly father-who doesn't like movies that aren't &#34;real&#34;.  He loved it.  Bravo to the screenwriters, directors, and producers.
B0037471SU|5.0|clever and exciting hard to put the novel down. it has unexpected twists that work well. very well constructed plot
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game its so much fun and the graphics are great. But I just wish they didn't have ads
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a great book! Not only was it steamy but actually had a storyline unlike some other &#34;romance&#34; novels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is minecraft. it is not a copy it is the real deal.I have built 3 houses a lighthouse and a platform in the sky. Totally worth the $7.00.
078322737X|5.0|I have always loved this movie since I grew up in that era could relate to every part of this movie, especially those cruising scenes since I use do that in my Low Rider 1966 Chevy Impala.
B008602KQI|5.0|THIS MOVIE SHOULD MAKE EVERONE THINK ABOUT WHY WE ARE LETTING REGULAR, CRIMINAL, GREEDY PEOPLE RUN OUR COUNTRY INTO THE GROUND. THINK ABOUT IT.  THIS COULD BE OUR FUTURE..
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I like the game but I get requests from friends and can not open them to reply?? And I . cat add friends who play to my top friends list.
B00EMJBVAI|1.0|I am a huge zombie movie fan.  I was excited about this movie because of the previews on TV.  They showed the best scenes for previews.  I then read the book because I didn't make it to the movies.  The book was great.  It was written as interviews instead of chapters.  The movie was nothing, I mean nothing like the book.  The movie had no substance.  If you are a zombie fan, read the book and skip this movie.
1593157134|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to everyone, especially someone in sales.  I have already recommended to several people in my office.  I have started following his ideas in the book and its already changed my life for the better.  It's very simple to follow but yet very affective.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|One of the most beautiful stories of a near-death experience that I've read. It gives a  divine message of love for us all. Loved it!!!
B00F35BV64|4.0|A decent prequel to &#34;The Wrath of Khan.&#34;<br /><br />Twelve more words are needed now six. Five more and this is done.
B009K916ZK|5.0|This Adapter is a wonder tool. Saw a lot of them that were cheaper, but I took the Apple one and it has been just what I wanted.
B00EQUP3Q6|3.0|For me Nine Inch Nails are like the Himalayas.... The very highest peaks. Before I had been in love with Talking Heads, Massive Attack, Underworld, New Order, now Burial... But none of them came as close to both aspiring and bleeding in a succinct musical language as Trent Reznor managed to do... at the concerts I was shocked at how many knew all the words. I wanted to share it with them--like a blood-letting... The Fragile. for me, was Mount Everest. Still would be next,  maybe Mt. Fuji. Pretty Hate Machine is K2, then even recently, Year Zero was  a soaring mountain up there somewhere. Beside You In Time  and Every Day Is Exactly The Same showed he still had it, as did the soundtracks, so much good stuff...<br />Now I have the new CD, Came Back Haunted-meh..., Copy of A--very good, Everything--arghh. Find My Way--Nice, but not quite With or Without You, Various Methods of Escape and All Time Low very high... Overall, not life-changing, like so much of the early work was, I like it but the recent Burial is far better. Still, thanks, Trent!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works  as told cleans all. Good app.  But what about I pad? Is there a similar one for I pad users
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Being an introvert, I found her understanding validating and accurate and this could be a fine book for a parent with either type of child--although I was more drawn to the discussions on the introvert.  Not sure why, but somehow it didn't feel deep enough in it's entirety.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been a devoted Stephen King fan ever since 'Carrie' and have read all his books, novellas and short stories.  11/22/63 resonated with me on many levels.  I was 22 when JFK was assassinated and I will never forget that awful time.  This book brought all of those events into a mesmerizing story that I could not put down. I personally think there is no other writer out there with Mr. King's ability to frame a story with his incredible use of language. I laughed and I cried reading this book and felt like I was back in 1963 again. I strongly recommend this book for those who lived through those times and especially for those for whom it is only history.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|My Granddaughter had watched this film when she was little. Got it for her to watch again, she loves it still.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|What a roller coaster ride!  The action starts right away and carries through to the end.  Again the characters are true enough to themselves that you get an entertaining movie and some well timed chuckles.  The use of 3D produces some stunning eye candy and yet added to the realism.  3D faces and pillows that seem realistically 3D and not over done, but also debris flying through your living room on occasion.  The story was a good choice and less worrisome than the 'Star Trek: Enterprise' feel of the first.  A bold choice to include an iconic figure from the past has proven controversial.  It is impossible to fill the original shoes.  However, the actor did a great job and I was perfectly at ease with the inclusion to the story.  I don't want to add a spoiler so I will just leave it at that.<br /><br />3D note:<br />We had to replace our TV due to its death, so we went with 3D which was a negligible add on.  I wasn't sure it would work for me. But I can't imagine watching this movie without it.  It just brings so much more to you.<br /><br />I highly recommend watching this movie and just having fun with it.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|I think this was sort of a &#34;Cliff's Notes&#34; book.  I believe my daughter had to write a book report for school and wanted to see the movie or she was in school and someone told her this was a very good movie.  I cant remember anymore, she graduated in 2009.

B0045HCJT4|4.0|I liked Kurt Russell since I saw him in John Carpenters The Thing, he's just a good all around actor even in this movie where he barely even speaks, his expressions do all the talking.<br />This is a B movie but the story's good and so are all the actors, including Gary Busy.<br />Russell plays a man trained since childhood for one purpose only and that is to be a soldier and follow orders without question but as he grows older he becomes obsolete and is cruelly replaced and dumped on a waste disposal planet, that's all I'll give away about the movie so I don't give away any more spoilers.<br />Connie Nielson in this movie who I recognized from the movie Gladiator and is as beautiful as ever.<br />I saw this movie in 1999 and thought it was worth buying and I've watched it several times since I've received it from Amazon.<br />If you like science fiction you should like this movie, check it out, it's worth the price and it's fun to watch.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!!

B006GHA9QQ|4.0|We &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34; fans know he got away.... but then what? Andrew Lloyd Webber presents an intriguing theory.<br />While the original was set in an opera house it seemed like more of a sideshow. Here, set in a sideshow t's truly more of an opera than the original. The music ties in to the original score without repeating it.<br />If you loved &#34;Phantom&#34; and want to know what happened next, this is the only way I've found that tries to explore that and worth a look. The actors' voices are marvelous, especially the boy's.<br />My only criticism is the camera work. You simply can't get the intended impact of a staged production because the camera chooses t to focus on close-ups and narrow views of the stage. I would love to see this in person and see what the House of Mirrors was truly intended to feel like.

B00DQVSTCG|5.0|The show was fantastic; I saw her live in Abu Dhabi last year and was blown away. Although I must admit that the editing was overdone it kind of steals the artistry that was showcased during the live concert with wrong angles at times that dont seem to be in place, or camera not focusing on Madonna when it should have. Nevertheless, this is a great collection for fans to have as I personally think that the MDNA tour is Madonna's second best tour after Blond Ambition.

The biggest complaint I have against the series is that it is filled with soft porn.i.e. numerous naked men and women, homosexual and lesbian content, infidelity,and many more moral indiscretions. I would rate this a porno movies lacking only visual penis entry into both male and female &#34;actors?&#34; The blood spilling is of sufficient quantity to keep your local blood bank filled for 10 years or more.I would not waste my money on any of these soft porn movies.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|By far, my favorite movie of all time. This movie had a deliverance that you wish were found in more films. Great story, great characters, great twists, great cast .. Everything can be found in this film. And I don't say that lightly.<br /><br />The story unfolds in 1947 when banker Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \\"Red\\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the \\"bull queer\\" gang \\"the Sisters\\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).<br /><br />In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.<br /><br />In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias \\"Randall Stephens\\".<br /><br />In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.<br /><br />What happens next , you will just have to watch !<br /><br />It's definitely WORTH THE WATCH if you haven't seen it.<br /><br />In fact, I am most confident that you will enjoy this one.<br /><br />More movies like this, please.

B0083Z6AH6|5.0|While a challenging read for contemporary readers, the plot is good and characters dimensional. Anne shines with feeling and restraint.. Wentworth is unreadable right up to the point where he declares his true feelings.<br /><br />When you consider that this is a very early example of a novel, you appreciate how groundbreaking it really is. Jane Austen rocks!

0307887898|3.0|I would say that much of this has already been addressed especially if you already have a degree. Taylorism has been around for a century and to hear that repeated frankly is not new.  Having said this though I think that there is a bit of methdology that is in this that usually is missing from business books.  The situations that he presents are real and frankly do happen.  Some might disreguard this as being another business book but I must say near the last 10% of the book it finally gets into a bit of how to test the metrics.<br /><br />If you read business books I would recommend it but you might want a pass if you have a masters degree or higher. To a point I think that some of the end might actually be better put back in the beginning but I'll leave that for the author to decide.

B0036BK6MW|1.0|I think Sandra Bullock did good, the only reason I give it a 1 is because I don't like the story. I guess it's inspirational, but I think almost anyone with super rich guardians or parents can achieve anything.<br /><br />So I guess the story is really about her, but for me it's not inspirational in the sense of - oh anyone can do this, because a lot of people don't have ultra rich sponsors.<br /><br />I would have loved a story about someone who truly made it on his own or at least with working class parents. Of course this is based on real life, but I'm just saying.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was really trying to give this book 2.5 stars, I'm ok with 3 stars. In my opinion,  it was the worst out of all 3 books. For a while, I disliked Katniss for a bit throughout the book because of how she treated Peeta. I understood her actions, I just didn't like it. I also disliked the ending. I really don't want to get too in depth for the reasons why I partly disliked the end of the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; triology because I would be releasing too much of the story. I think the book should be purchased, it's just not my favorite.

006114665X|5.0|The standard mid-20th century narrative explained how WW1 happened: Europe was a tinderbox primed for war; the assassination of an obscure Austrian arch-duke not important in itself, merely the match struck which finally plunged the continent into a war that was waiting to happen; then a quick cut to the military mechanics: who mobilized when and where.  Somewhat mystifying and ultimately unsatisfying considering the scope and the horrific after-shock of WW1.  I could never settle for \\"it just happened\\".<br /><br />What I liked right away about Christopher Clark's book is that he takes the Sarajevo assassination seriously, he takes the Serbian assassins seriously, he tells us more about that obscure Austrian arch-duke.  He devotes the first two chapters of his book to the history of Serbia and its relationship to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  With a few swift strokes he sketches in how the Austro-Hungarian Empire came to be, writing as if the reader knows nothing about central European history and needs to be brought up to speed.  He elucidates great power tensions arising from the declining Ottoman Empire; what that decline meant for Russian interests in the Turkish Straits; the effect of that on Russia's relationship with Austro-Hungary....  I could feel myself relaxing into this book right away.  Serbs, Russians, Hungarians, Austrians, Bulgarians and Ottoman Turks -- it reminded me of my favorite WW2 novelist Alan Furst who writes about the lesser-known venues of the war.  A new perspective on the familiar story, and illuminating because of that.<br /><br />The particular strength of Clark's history is elucidation of the great power alliance systems of pre-war Europe, starting in the 1890's.  Providing a very smooth introductory overview of the calculations of the great powers, Clark embodies that rare blend of competent professional and talented teacher guiding the novice through the intricacies of a grandmaster chess game.  A hard act to pull off but Clark makes it look easy.  For long stretches his history reads like a bestselling novel of international intrigue with the writing geared well at the level of the general reader who has a strong interest in the subject.  For the most part you don't need to be a history major or a WW1 buff to read the book easily, although it is densely written and requires concentration.  You might get badly bogged down, as I did, slogging through the diplomatic intricacies of the Balkan Wars but this is about the only price to be paid for a superb understanding of the origins of WW1.<br /><br />The \\"sleepwalkers\\" metaphor is somewhat lame. Sleepwalking into a general European war isn't much of an improvement over \\"Europe was a tinderbox waiting for the match to be struck\\".  But the text belies the title.  Clark gives sleepwalking lip service but he fails to make the case.  Instead he clearly demonstrates two great powers, neither of them Germany, actively promoting a general European war  --  because only in that milieu can each one hope to achieve its own particular \\"interests\\".  It is possible that with 'sleepwalking' Clark is taking a gentlemanly step back from his powerful narrative.  If history is the story of the winning side, this is an authoritative and persuasive rebuttal.<br /><br />Where most WW1 historians begin with the mobilizations  --  at that time acts of war in themselves  --  Clark ends with the mobilizations.  His history deals with the individuals who unleashed those armies, often after overcoming political opposition within their own governments.  The most poignant moment in this entire convoluted story is when Tsar Nicholas II tries to call off the general mobilization: \\"I will not be responsible for a monstrous slaughter!\\"  He has received a telegram from his cousin.  The German Kaiser is not inclined to war if it can be avoided: \\"military measures on the part of Russia could be looked upon by Austria as threatening, would precipitate a calamity we both wish to avoid.\\"  A big \\"what-if\\" moment there, and a reflection on how real-life monarchs can be somewhat like chess kings  --  weak pieces when it comes to aggressive combinations.  The Tsar's order to cancel the mobilization lasted only 24 hours, he was prevailed upon by his government ministers and signed the fateful order..\\"  A big \\"what-if\\" moment there, and a reflection on how real-life monarchs can be somewhat like chess kings  --  weak pieces when it comes to aggressive combinations.

0385495323|4.0|Though I liked Fermat's Enigma more, The Code Book was really good.  I especially liked the section concerning dead languages.  Singh has a special way of writing about math and numbers that makes it informative and fun to read.

0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is really little more than a repackaging of past stories.  There's Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, some Orwell's 1984 and even some aspects of Stephen King's Running Man (though probably more the movie than the book).  The characters are flirtatious yet chaste - yes, I know the book is for young readers but I would prefer they read about healthy relationships than barbaric savagery comprised of killing children for entertainment.<br /><br />Despite these overriding issues, the story was basically flat for me, I can't say it was horrible.  Collins has used some good material in creating her own story, and the movie, which was also just okay, has made me slightly interested in reading the next book though I probably won't spend money on it.<br /><br />Lastly, I've allowed my 9 (now 10) year old read both the Harry Potter series and Ender's Game, but I'm not letting him read this one because I don't think it's good enough to warrant exposing him to the violence of it.

The humor and wit haven't diminished over the centuries and the journey of Eliza Bennett is just as dynamic to me years and many reads later.

The new Star Trek movies also inspired me to start watching the old T.V. series and it is so great! Awesome movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. I love being able to watch these shows on my kindle so I can get caught up before the new season starts. Definately a great buy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Crying.... That was beautifully written. I can't even begin to describe my love for this book in depth. Amazing. I think that everyone deserves a Hazel and an Augustus in their life.
B00DGKVW9Y|5.0|As an audiophile, I've been hooked to this player since the day I purchased. The sound quality is absolutely amazing and if you have high sensitivity headphones, you'll be blown away with the musicality of the sound and the level of detail you hear. Make sure using 320kbps mp3's minimum. Ideally use FLAC files to get the optimal performance. It is a robust device and easy to navigate. Don't even compare it with an ipod. X3 is a different animal.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is a great way to see how to take care of your horse  thanks  my horse.
B009LDD1X0|1.0|This is a 3 disc set of the 6th season.  Mine arrived with 2 copies of disc one and one of disc three.  LAME!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I think that there should be more time on it because I'm trying to get the full one but my kindle is being really retarded but anyway you get like 15 minutes to play but then you have to restart which makes me really mad.  &lt;3 Katie
B003U53GK8|4.0|These episodes made you wonder what was coming next. I have always like movies about survival. This was no exception.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I started playing on my cell phone but switched to my kindle and I was so pleased. Great graphics, very lifelike. I love the characters and the challenges. Even tips on how to play. Great game for kids and adults. Awesome game
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Totally addicted!! Love the twists and surprises each episode. Would highly recommend if your looking to watch a new series and have prime
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is enjoyable, and you never know when the next game will be harder or easier.  I guess it depends on how clear your mind is when you play.  I'm glad you can start over, although, at my age, I have a hard time remembering what I did wrong so as not to repeat it when I retry.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|One of the better bubble games but it always crashes deep into the game. Wish they would come up with a fix.
B00AC8ZIXO|2.0|A little slow starting and anemic plot made it hard to watch for me.<br />Might be enjoyable for others though.
B000QUCNXG|2.0|Some how did not feel as if I was reading a book which would provide a deeper insight to the conflict of fundamentalism. Of course the first hand narrative suggesting a chance meeting conversation in Lahore was stylish, but did not really go beyond that. Disappointing, but good style and form.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is awesome it is so fun everyone should have this app I recomend this app for everyone awesome
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Great classics! I bought this for a gift. The recipient wanted the song, &#34;She Loves you.&#34; He loves it. Plays and sings it with joy!
B001VTTRC6|3.0|We thought the actors did a good job.  But the story was a little on the Dark side for my taste.  The tragic ending was somewhat predictable.<br /><br />I someone likes movies that are a little on the dark side, I would reccoment they watch Mystic River.
B006BFK5DK|2.0|I have been a E W & F fan since the beginning. This CD is by far there worst CD ever.  I waited a long time even Pre-ordered it. Dose not sound like the E W & F of the passed.  Maybe they should try again.  I will always be a fan.  But I have too give this CD a thumps down.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Didn't want it to end. I bought the 2 book but it was the same as the first with only a few little changes. But it was still good
0321934318|5.0|I really enjoy reading Scott Kelby's guides. I really relate to his instructional style. This is the third Lightroom book I've purchased. Although a lot of it is redundant info to me, he always adds just enough to teach me something new. I enjoy the free presets, white balance sheet and general tips throughout. Kelby Lightroom books have definitely made me feel like a Photoshop Lightroom expert.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's something that we all need. Its a good app that will help us when we need some fast help, or to double check,
B005CA4SJW|5.0|this  is  one  of  the  best  shows  and  if u  don't  have  it  then u r  lost. it  is  filled  full  of  drama n  action  along  with  suspense
B00BXI26XC|5.0|A really good application.  Allows viewer to see flight comings/goings all around the world and doesn't require any 'operating', only a hot spot connection (from the mobile) to identify each flight I sight (and those not in sight, still coming).
B005PK56TA|5.0|Amazing!  This show was a breath holder from beginning to end.  We couldn't stop watching.  Check it out right now!
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Ideal for use as  a diary.  Simple to use/add to and good to have an ?alarm' to notify of upcoming scheduled appointments.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Got the blue ray in the time that was told. Item was as stated new. All I can say is Thanks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is really a fun game but costs a little bit much. it has more interesting parts than temple run.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple to use. I like it because of its ease to use. Every device has a core app that you should have this is one of them.
B0017SXHR2|4.0|The Thirty-Nine Steps, 1935 film<br /><br />This film begins in a Music Hall with an act for \\"Mr. Memory\\" who takes questions from the audience and gives the correct answers. A fight breaks out at the bar. Shots are fired and the crowd runs out. A lady asks Richard Hannay to take her home. She seems to be fleeing and afraid; she fired the shots to cause a diversion. Annabelle knows of a plot to steal vital military secrets from England. The next morning Annabelle has been stabbed and dies after warning Hannay! Those men will stop at nothing. She leaves a clue about a man in Scotland. Now Hannay makes his escape to Scotland. The dead body is discovered and Hannay is wanted by the police.<br /><br />On the train Hannay tries to escape the police, who seem to know of his escape to Scotland. He starts walking to his destination, and stops at a farm house. The police arrive, but Hannay escapes again to eventually arrive at the Professor's mansion. Out of the frying pan and into the fire? But Hannay escapes again, and melds into a crowd. There is an amusing scene where he is mistake for a guest speaker. His platitudes are met with cheers. Then two detectives arrest him and take him back. But there is another escape in the dark night. But now Hannay has a companion; she learns the truth.<br /><br />The lady goes to tell Scotland Yard about the theft of a military secret, but they don't believe her. They know of her connection to Hannay. When \\"Mr. Memory\\" tells what the \\"39 Steps\\" mean he is shot with scenes recalling Lincoln's assassination. The police capture the spies and save the military secret. Since WW I secrets have been photographed on microfilm for speed and accuracy; this memory trick is just a literary invention. This story came from one of the many novels of John Buchan, who was popular in the 1920s-1930s. Another writer was E. Phillip Oppenheim. Both dealt with foreign intrigue and espionage in their suspense novels. Alfred Hitchcock's very popular \\"North by Northwest\\" was another version of this story.<br />The original novel is much better than this film.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it is more of a &#34;chick flick&#34; than I was hoping for. I don't regret watching it, but I'm glad I didn't buy a copy of it. It just wasn't something I'd want to watch a 2nd or 3rd time.<br /><br />If you enjoy love stories, though, definitely watch it. It is a good one.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Made me sweat with anxiety!!! Each level added a growing fear of the next wave. Thankfully, there's a pause button!! An I'm only Private!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very challenging, but an excellent puzzle to play with layers that get more complex the higher you progress.Very good app.
B00BSOBM18|5.0|I loved this movie when ot first came put over 20 years ago and mow my son loves this classic too.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|This rendition seems like it's part animated feature, part musical without music.  Neither helps the character development. Although it was Fitzgerald's point, the class differences aren't visible because everyone lives in the cartoon. Everything is over larger and brighter than life.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Better than the infamous JB 007 ever was... If they don't have operatives like him, then we are in trouble. WHAT A GREAT READ!!! My only complaint is it reads too fast... Because you can't put it down!!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the weather channel app it's very easy to use and I like how I receive points for doing different things
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I was disappointed that Google play has it ONLY for tablet androids and not phones . Luckily this version worked and was pretty stoked , Not sure when Google play will ever have a phone version ,  but no matter this version works fine and for .99 its worth it .
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|G5 games have some of the best graphics around.  The puzzles are interesting and the story line for this particular game is pretty good.  It reminds you of an old movie plot you've seen on tv.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|A great comedy for the whole family. Fantastic animation and voice acting make this movie entertaining for all ages. It survives the test of time.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|You kill aleins with missiles with missiles. This is very simple but still fun and addicting with plenty of replayability.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Get this game right now if is awesome it is so fun and in the new update there is a sandbox mode that you can do anything you want it is totally worth the 2.99
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best game that i ever had i wish i can still keep it but i cant because i have to live life
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Took me a couple chapters to really get into it- but I love this totally different aspect of the (?) future.  Instead of the usual future stuff, you get a much different view, a much more interesting one.  Read it!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|WOW. Really good, I enjoyed the book.  The characters were just great it was kind of fun and exactly what you would expect  out of her books.  Thanks for a great story.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|As a senior citizen I have yet to find the diet that fits my lifestyle and works.<br /><br />This does.<br /><br />Each week since starting - the weight has come off.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Best movie by Robert Downey Jr. bar none.  Outstanding acting, great story telling, very good cinematography.  Supporting actors did an excellent job....
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Preety good movie, lots of action. Not like the stolone. Movie kinda liked it better. Lots an lots of shooting
B00CATSONE|2.0|The book mentions several of Tesla's achievements and struggles without going into any depth or study of his character.  Other people mentioned in the book, though important to Tesla's career, are painted with a few strokes of black and white crayons.  Facts are presented selectively to support the author's theory of how great men succeed and to sell his book that uses more examples to prove his thesis.<br />At least it's short.
B000000992|5.0|This is a legendary album, by a legendary band! This LP sounds great, clean!<br /><br />I don't know much about this particular pressing, other than it sounds great.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Once started I could not stop reading. I will say this book was excellent although the subject matter is terribly unsettling. The story seems very real.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I loved DD when it first came out and still like it but feel so sad that PS is gone.  I recently went to dinner theatre in Virginia and they had music of the 50's and I just loved it.  One of the boys was singing one of the songs from DD and I told him what a good job he did.... he said someone else had told him the same thing,  He had never heard of DD - so I sent it to him.  Thanks
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Written in the future, this is a awesome story of survival. Without any teasers, I would say, damm the six bucks, full speed ahead...and you will not be disappointed<br /><br />Good development of characters, unique storyline and setting...nothing bad except for wanting more
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|this show keeps you coming back and wanting more, I can't wait to see the next seasons and see what's in store
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|In the last six months or so, I have gotten to be quite the Justin Timberlake convert. What was the impetus for this sudden interest in JT's music? I would say The Jimmy Fallon Show. His \\"History of Rap\\" videos with JF are nothing short of brilliant. When the dynamic duo are up singing and rapping a montage of hip hop snapshots, the impersonations are spot on and, in some cases, better than the originals. Be they The Beastie Boys, Macklemore or Jay Z. Also, the young man can dance. So, I had to check out the much talked about The 20/20 Experience and get a sense of that album's flavor.<br /><br />The album kicks off with \\"Pusher Love\\" and alludes to his lover's sexual and romantic prowess, drawing us in with mid-tempo rhythms and lyrics comparing her sweetness to various street drugs. It transitions to the intergalactic dance anthem \\"Suit & Tie\\" that has every element spelling out \\"throwback.\\" Horn section and beats are flawless. I am not a Jay Z fan but I love JT on this one. His vocals are extremely sexy and infectious. \\"Don't Hold The Wall\\" works the hook to get us out on the floor dancing and making romance all along the way. \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" is full of innuendo and pseudo-innocence. Not at all saccharine once you understand the double entendre. \\"Tunnel Vision\\" is the scandalous single that was released with a video quickly censored by Youtube. \\"Spaceship Coupe\\" sounds like Justin Timberlake is channeling all of the soul greats and taking his lover on an interplanetary love ride. \\"Let The Groove In\\" gets my hips shaking and my shoulders rolling like a one-way ticket to Bahia, Brazil. There is definitely a Latin or dance hall feel to the percussion here, and the catchy hook. \\"Mirrors\\" is probably one of the most romantic love anthems of the summer. It truly describes JT's idea of a soul mate and his mirror image. What a more beautiful way to describe his love for wife Jessica Biel? \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" takes us 20,000 leagues below the sea. We hear the air tank as part of the background instrumental and is a slow ballad to friendship and enduring, unconditional love.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is probably one of the musical geniuses of our time. Though, his influences run far and wide when it comes to his inspiration for dance, music, acting and even comedy, his style is truly one of a kind. A great album. This young man just keeps getting more and more interesting with time.nk as part of the background instrumental and is a slow ballad to friendship and enduring, unconditional love.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is probably one of the musical geniuses of our time.

B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is a great game that requires you to use your drawing skills to solve puzzles. Each level has something that looks like a comma from which pours a stream of sugar, and one or more coffee cups which are the targets you must direct the sugar into. You have to use your finger to draw the structures needed to direct the sugar into the cups. The various levels have different pre-existing objects that you must contend with, and you can draw whatever you want to add to the game board to get the sugar to the right place. Some levels are made more complex with filters that change the color of the sugar as it falls through and target cups that need one color or the other. The cups have a number which indicates how much sugar they need to be full; any more sugar will bounce off the cup and be wasted if you are not careful.<br />The graphic design of Sugar, sugar is also appealing in a very minimalist way. The simple two color scheme of each level includes the name and number of the level in a large font that becomes part of the game board; you can get your sugar stuck within the crevices of the words &quot;level 2&quot; - a wonderful bit of visual humor.<br />I highly recommend this game for those who want to use their creativity in solving puzzles.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I was pleased to see that this DVD was finally released. I have been a fan of Queen since right after Freddy Mercury's passing. This concert at Wembley Stadium is one of the best ever recorded of Queen by far. It has something for everyone. This features all of the hits and so much more. We have \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\\" and other tunes that are actually really excellent covers of older songs by other artists.<br /><br />Freddy Mercury's amazing charisma, firecracker sense of humor and true atmosphere of confidence on that stage is mind blowing, as are the wonderful performances from his bandmates. A true piece of history forever put in time capsule on DVD and film.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love the complete character of special agent Pendergast and this book delivers another great layer of who he is.
B003A166OK|3.0|Its okay other Eastwoods are better. A little bit of humor compared to High Plains.  Good movie just not as thrilling.
0345472322|2.0|Although it has some useful information. It is EXTREMELY repetitive. It preaches about the growth mindset and how important it is to have, and goes on to give examples of how it has helped famous people. The biggest problem is that it never teaches you how to achieve a growth mindset.<br />An easy free alternative would be to google a description of what the growth mindset is. You will get the same information in 5/6 pages rather than 250.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was curious about the book after hearing that a movie was going to be made.  I read it and even though I could guess the ending I still cried.  Wonderful story for a hard subject matter....no one should have to deal with cancer least of all children.
B00B19G01C|4.0|I have been very disappointed in horror movies recently, and I wasn't expecting much from this movie.  But, this movie was surprisingly great!  It was scary and suspenseful.  It held my attention the entire time.  The ending was a bit disappointing, it felt sort of rushed and didn't have a good twist.<br /><br />Watch this movie, you won't regret it!
140006922X|5.0|Even though I did not agree with everything the author said, I thought this book was very good. I liked his writing style---easy to read. Some of it I knew already but it gave me a better perspective of things, giving me a better understanding of what I knew and in more depth. And I also learned many things. I went to Israel last year and I found this book to be well researched. I would recommend it.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|One of the BEST shows I have ever seen on TV.  The storylines are so well written, and the drama is so well shown.  These are people that you care about, even though they shoudn't be.  These are drug makers/dealers.  Even though they start out trying to do something good, they end up on the ass end of bad.  I haven't seen the last two episodes yet, but I know that it doesn't end well.  How could it?  They hurt people.  People they love.  Just seen the one where Hank is killed.  Sad.  Hank was a really good man, his partner too.  Hank was strong, he was still going to after Walt even though he was his brother-in-law and he had made the video saying that Hank was the one that was involved.  Hank and his partner did not deserve to die, and they didn't deserve to be buried out in the desert.  I feel bad for Marie.  She definately didn't deserve to lose her husband. She is probably the most innocent adult involved.  Except for Junior.  Jessie Pinkman is getting exactly what he deserves.  Being used as a slave.  Who knows how many lives he has destroyed by making that drug.  No pity.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|loves the story, the movie...Broadway is next!  Definitely a great story for adults as well.  Can't wait to see it.
0525952926|4.0|This fiction historical novel is a great read it reads like you are there and living the life with all of the characters and I like the way that he ties everyone into the story together
0385523394|5.0|I have always preferred non-fiction writing. Finding a great author, someone who can write honestly and fairly, yet with great insight and humor is like finding gold!<br />I really enjoyed this book.  Piper Kerman is real.  She is heartfelt and human in her writing.  Despite the fact that she came from a way different world than most of the women in the prison system, she looks at is squarely and does not draw lines based on that.<br />Her humor paced throughout the story was also gentle, but really kept a levity to an ugly situation.<br />I loved this book!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|The Presidents club informed the reader that the presidents from Hoover up to the present that they belong to an elite companionship that helped them with after being the president and advice given to the one's in office.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Great movie! I read the book a while back and from what I remember it really stuck to the story line. However, I wish the movie would have shown some of the other planets.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Jack White is a phenom, it doesn't matter if its with a band or solo. For any fan this is a must album, great single!
B0089LOG02|4.0|This novel is based on a true story...hard to believe that these poor, little children were whisked off and sent out west on a train to be adopted!  Kline does a great job of telling the story!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable works as stated. Keeps my kindle charged which keeps me happy. Fast turnaround time when I ordered it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This novel grabs you from the very beginning! Very well written and full of twists and turns.  I loved it and have recommended it to my book club for a discussion.
B000UZNSWM|5.0|Korea was the war of my generation, contemporary with whose with whom I went to school and to college. I knew some of the boys who returned, who told me of some who didn't and with chilling clarity of how they died.The author portrays the impossible cold of the peninsula, the unpreparedness for the brutal weather, and most fascinating for me, the complete arrogance and mismanagement of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Gripping historical study.
0767821629|4.0|I got this when I was on an alternative reality kick and enjoyed it alot. I watched it again recently and still enjoyed it, so that says something. I got it at the the same time as eXistenZ, which I think is not as good as The Thirteenth Floor.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|it is a very addicting puzzle game not too difficult but difficult enough to keep you entertained. it's great for free app of the day and it's definitely worth a try!!
B00000K31V|3.0|I got this when I was on an alternative reality kick and enjoyed it. However, I got it at the the same time as The Thirteenth Floor, which I think is better and rated four stars. I watched both again recently and still rate them the same.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Very good;a real page_Turner. The ending was just the right touch. To people who lived thru the actual event it will.bring back memories long buried

B006AZZPCM|2.0|OK I love this app and I cant stretch that enough, but the update completely ruined it for me. it deleted so many of my songs I only have 31 left out of the 200 I downloaded, every time I download something my kindle runs slower for as long as its on, and deleted videos. I would complain about the format overall but there's too much! I tried to go to old ver. but when I tried it said there was no old version. I might actually have to delete it because of this update!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Great movie to add to the collection! Got this for a birthday present and was a big hit for a fraction of the cost of retail stores!

B000I3UMLQ|5.0|I have and always will be your biggest fan (to Star Trek).<br />I saw all the bad reviews and wanted to point out that not all ST fans are jerks with a bad agenda to slam ST movies, so here goes.<br /><br />The movie starts at a place of magic that I personally feel is one of the best places on the planet Earth, Yosemite at Half-Dome. For anyone that has been there, you know this place is dear to anyones heart that experienced it. This puts a timeless stamp of footage on film for future generations. The camping culture of people was represented, they are very different than the techno people of today. The glitches in the \\"new\\" ship may have been a reference to all the problems we had with our space shuttle program and was somewhat a political statement on the struggles we were having to actually explore space in real life, this thought is lost on current generations because we no longer have a manned space program. The people that were part of that space endeavor were right there with ST on that one. The Klingon nature of aggression was well represented and does shine a light on the persistence of war mongers vs. science vessel, which \\"Enterprise\\" was very much equipped for science. The rescue of the hostages was very differently executed vs. STNG and this movie very much shows the Kirk vs. Picard difference, if you ever watched STNG. I almost thought we were in the Cantina on Tattooine for a moment on the dusty planet, so JJ Abrams is not the only one to tie in SW with ST. I was sure I'd see some blasters shooting off and bounty hunters exploding, \\"wink,wink\\". The vulcan leader of the hostages was pretty well played and fit well in the vulcan world. The villian was well played and thoroughly believable. This was an odd way to show how much Spock had changed, he was beyond guru, he was reborn. It almost elevates Spock to Q imho, if Q existed in that series, haha. All of the classic crew did a great job and fans of the original tv series were greatly rewarded with classic lines and character behavior. The scene with Uhura dancing was entrancing and really lets you see how she wasn't just a radio operator, but a master of sound and a sexy woman. This entire movie could have been a trilogy and each part more developed with more details, but ST fans can just imagine those parts. We used to imagine things often before the CGI movies hit the pavement.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This is a great film.  Very fast paced, and the twists and turns it takes will have you boggled!  I recommend it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a wonderful book.  This was my second time reading it and I still found it to be a well written and thought provoking book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|WAS HE GUILTY OR NOT ?  MY Sister in law suggested that I read this book.  I enjoyed it but could not decide if Jacob was guilty or innocent.  I believe that his mother tried to kill both of them in the car wreck to spare the family any more humiliation and to spare any future victims if Jacob really was a killer.  B W
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|This is a great game. The hints are useful if needed although the game isn't to difficult.  I only wish it was longer!
B002QE3CTY|1.0|Characters, plot, environment, and everything else is bland and trite. I don't like giving one star reviews, but I couldn't find anything to redeem this novel. Yes, it's YA, but the material is so weak that it couldn't give anyone the slightest depth of entertainment, let alone food for thought.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it. totally addictive! Can't wait too see what they come up with for more levels!  Some where Quite challenging.
B004M5HUXE|4.0|Since this novel is now 85 years old, I expected to be bored.  Not at all. Really racy novel for 1928. Even for current readers, some graphic sex scenes.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|the movie was awesome except for the streaming interruptions. it only happens with new releases on amazon usually i have no problems.
B0091REZMW|2.0|It's really an awesome game, been playing for years but the creators are a very greedy bunch and as long as you are willing to pay its the only way you are going to advance at a normal rate....
B0039O8AQK|5.0|Very well acted, portrayed, and directed. A haunting vision of totalitarianism run to an extreme where ideas, privacy, language, and individuality are leveled to support a collective society based on lies and power. Unfortuantely the modern survelance state looks like it uses this story as its operating guide. Scary!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This cover met our expectations and is sturdy and helps to cover up our child's Kindle.  It works great!  Love it.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|I loved it keeps you guessing to the very end...its suspenseful and the tricks are pretty amazing. It surprised me
B005636HPS|3.0|I wish I had known this was edited for kids, maybe something like [clean] in the title.  This is why people don't buy songs...
B00197U0DU|5.0|This is Genesis as they were finding their feet and their musical style. This is the album before Foxtrot which is what propelled them to fame and cemented their musical and writing style. Not to be missed by completeists nor those who revel in Progressive Rock's finest moments.
B002GSXKN8|4.0|What can I say after tons of other reviewers' comments.  The first three of these four were my favorites, with the George Clooney outing by far the weakest over all.  I personally think Keaton was the best in the Batman role with Val Kilmer and Company doing a solid follow up job.  These earlier versions of the Batman saga are the best in my humble opinion.  They are not the overdone, over the top redos we have been subjected to since.  This is a nice collection to have, movie buff or no, and superior in quality to the VHS offerings.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinning is all I get done :) I need to get out more. Internet, why won't you let me sleep??
B0009QTS1M|5.0|This was a powerfully moving story, stunningly filmed and masterfully paced.  All the major players are excellent.  The extras included are a feast for movie buffs or just someone interested in the making of this film.  There is also added scenes not seen in the theatrical release.  While a lot of effort was put in to making the costumes, weapons, tactics, etc. accurate to history, the history of this emperor was not very accurate.  Marcus Aurelius finally promoted his own son to share the throne as a Co-Caesar before his death from natural causes.  Commodus was strangled by his hired wrestling partner in a plot to get rid of him.  Pertinax took over as emperor as arranged, but his reign was short and led to another  &#34;Year of four Caesars&#34; period.  Commodus had light blond hair we are told by Herodian, and was extremely handsome!  But why quibble with details, the story as told is still quite engaging.  But Hollywood misses the mark by not exploiting the real events which are just as interesting instead of spinning their own version--as seen here!  Still, this one is worth the money.
B001K3K5MO|5.0|I love watching Top Gun, over and over.  I love the music they picked to go with this movie. Great movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was very skeptical of the series at first being a late 20's male but it was really good.  I couldn't put the book down.  I typically read fiction books.  The reading was pretty easy but that doesn't really matter - I don't feel like you have to be challenged every time you read.
B000IDEORY|5.0|What an awesome, now classic movie. I always enjoy watching. And no body puts baby in the corner. I can watch this over and over.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just kept me entertained and could not quit until I opened the elevator to the next floor.  Would definetly recommend it to anyone who enjoys searching for clues to solve puzzles it's the one for you!
0062082353|4.0|Could not put it down. Christ was a great SEAL and a great person also. His story is one very American<br />should be aware of.
0307271080|4.0|\\"Americanah\\" is a sad fiction novel.  It is well written in a way that will tickle your funny bone; puncture holes to the emotions of those sensitive hearts, tear drops will float your mind to engage in her journey to the American dreams.<br /><br />A story of a young woman's relationship with (Obinze) her first love.  She invites the readers to enter and join in the secret world of her struggles: connect with her soul in coping with loneliness and rejection, as well as conquering her inner war with shame and guilt that poisoned her intimate relationship with the only man she wanted to be with for the rest of her life.<br /><br />\\"Ifemelu\\" discovers a wide road to racism and poverty in the United States of America.  Her desires to create a good life with a young love that she left behind in Nigeria have been washed away from her heart and mind.<br /><br />NOTE: I'm still reading the book and I'm on chapter 16.  I do not have the final conclusion to her story (yet).  But it has been a good read so far.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|It is a great book. Well written and very enjoyable to read. At times it was very hard to put down.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I was amazed at how realitic this movie was. I was sceptical because the previews didnt do a good job on depicting the zombie. Very impressive. I highly recommend it for your collection especially for the zombie lovers!!
B005LAII12|5.0|Ted is a very funny movie. All time film. 5 out of 5 stars. I would highly recommend the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this tv series.  The writing and the acting is wonderful!  I also enjoy  the attention to detail and costuming very much.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This LEGO set is an absolute trip down memory lane. I've always been a fan of both Back to the Future and LEGO and so I jumped at the chance to buy the combination of the two.<br /><br />I ALMOST deducted a star for this set, though, since it includes pieces that can be used to make the DeLorean look like it appeared in the third movie and we just can't have people going around being forced to remember that embarrassment, now can we?<br /><br />5/5 jiggawatts.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really like this game - especially the free daily tournament. It's a great way to boost up your coins and stuff.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This is my first book by this author but it won't be my last. I really enjoyed getting to know the characters of Pride, and loved the small town aspect. I really enjoyed seeing the story that transpired between Megan and Todd I can't wait to see what happens to the characters in the rest of the series.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is great. The ease of setup was astounding. Anybody could do it. I even have my 50+ parents using it easily. So far, I have been using the chromecast to stream Plex to my TV. Much easier than using any other device. The amount of functionality you can have is amazing. Support for Mac, Windows, and Android is great... all of the devices used in the house!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to setup<br />Easy to use<br />Great quality!<br />Comes with everything you need: Chromecast device, HDMI extender (for hard-to-reach places and to improve wi-fi reception), USB cable and power adapter<br />ANY tab is &#34;castable&#34;<br />Local media support via drag and drop into browser (With cast extension in chrome)<br /><br />Cons:<br />No local media support for Android<br />Device lags depending on what the computer is doing. A heavy computer load will make some audio and video choppy.<br /><br />I fully recommend this device.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Defines a generation. So much fun. Must have for any true gamer. Music is awesome and it tells a fun story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's funnier than subway surfers they have a movie also part two so it's really cool guy it's free so get it right now
159463176X|4.0|I sometimes got confused when reading this book but it did keep my interest.  I think his first two novels were better.
B00DQVST76|5.0|With humility, I confess that I have had the good luck of being able to attend multiple concerts.  Madonna's 2012 tour stop in the Washington D.C. area was one of them, and I would easily rate her live performance as one of the top three best concerts (that I attended).  \\"Madonna's MDN World Tour\\" dvd is a continuation of the musical intensity and energy she puts out to give fans of her music an exhilarating show.  She creatively opens the show with various dancers dressed in red robes and eloquently closes with an energetic rendition of \\"Celebration\\".  Additionally, I found it heartwarming when Madonna took the time after \\"Open Your Heart\\" to thank her fans.  \\"I Don't Give A\\", \\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Vogue\\", \\"Erotic Candy Shop\\", and \\"Human Nature\\" are some of my favorite performances from this dvd. However, the following is the complete concert track listing for those who prefer more information on the songs that were performed (in sequential order): Virgin Mary (Intro), Girl Gone Wild, Revolver, Gang Bang, Papa Don't Preach, Hung Up, I Don't Give A, Best Friend, Express Yourself, Give Me All Your Luvin, Turn Up The Radio, Open Your Heart, Masterpiece, Justify My Love, Vogue, Erotic Candy Shop, Human Nature, Like A Virgin, Love Spent, Nobody Knows Me, I'm Addicted, I'm A Sinner, Like A Prayer, and Celebration.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|A great story, wonderful characters and some good lessons for all.  The characters were all perfect for their parts.  Loved it
1595141715|5.0|This is a great book, Thirteen  Reasons Why is perfect from beginning to end. I totally recommend it to everyone!
0060763280|3.0|I found this one to be a re-hash of other peoples thoughts and writing.  Not plagiarism, but a detailed expansion of the concepts espoused by others.  I am not sure if it needed to be in this format.  My impression was the Harv just wanted to write another book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good for the whole family kids to parents challenging enough for mom and dad but easy for young kids 3 and up who can play dress up with the horse or just look at the different ones
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Its one of the rare times where the tv episodes are better.  Good but definitely not great.  kind of boring.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The paid version is so much better than the free one. Pay the $1. It is more than worth it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a book club book for me. It was well written and I loved it. Difficult to put down. Leaves you wanting to know more about the characters. I would recommend it for others who are in a book club.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|Very good classic movie with great actors. I have seen the movie several times and enjoyed it. Cary Grant is excellent. Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it , love it , love it... so hard to put it down ... Every one should try this game at least one time .
076781214X|5.0|There is just something about this movie that I love. Kathleen Turner turns in a great performance as a woman that has a chance to change her past to change her future.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Fun and easy to control. Great way to pass the time and I love how great the graphics. The different suits are cool to unlock and upgrade, I only wish it were easier to get the blue crystals.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|Love Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant. This movie is just wonderful. Classic film with great cast, great script and just great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|OMG best game ever way better than temple run here I'll prove it with 5 good reasons :D<br /><br />#1 temple run (tr) has one map while despicable me minion rush (dm) has three<br />#2 who want coin when you can have bananas :D<br />#3 way more character options on dm than tr<br />#4 dm is way easier in the car because u use your finger<br />#5 dm has way better and more items than tr<br /><br />There now do me a favor GET THIS APP!!!!! :D
0780626494|5.0|Love the stars and the concept. Good performances, funny and heart warming scenes. Dave Foley is funny. Brandon Frazer captures his part.
B00B0VI1XQ|5.0|I would gift this CD to my friend, then I will listen it in LP platform.<br />He is the greatest musician in this century.
B002SJKWZ4|2.0|I figured you would be able to program a TV by plugging in a USB or something. But doing every command with the TV is ridiculous. Once you do all the work it's great but until then, it's just irritating.
B005529EI2|5.0|My wife LOVES the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, so I've bought them for her. We enjoyed them all immensely. We rate it a 5-Star.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Good idea but poor execution.  Wouldn't recommend at this time.  I really hope that Google improves this product as I like the idea.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|I'm glad that I purchased this one for my wife, as it made her laugh! I think this movie is one of her go-to movies now, which isn't so bad. :-)<br /><br />5-Star!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This movie was better then I expected....it had a good twist at the end and Tom Cruise did a good job.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|We would recommend this flick to anyone. Quite amazing how it's done, and the graphics and artistry, AMAZING. Another 5-Star. Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00DJ6KYWQ|5.0|This was a Great book, very well researched and up to Frederick Forsyth's usual high standard. It is worth buying
0399165274|5.0|This is the best Forsyth thriller I've ever read. It gets off to a horrifying start with seemingly random killings of American political figures, adds killings of Brits, and slowly builds to a very satisfying, believable climactic covert operation that kills the convert to radical Islam known as the Preacher, who's modeled on Anwar al-Awlaki, in southern Somalia. I strongly recommend it to any reader who likes the work of Daniel Silva and/or Brad Thor.
B006UV8DJS|4.0|Color splash effect is awesome it makes my pictures look so cool your not marking a mistake if you get it.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I've watched Star Trek from the original series from the 1960's and am a proud Trekie through and through.  I was disappointed with their attempt at their movies last time, but a fan of all the off shoots to the Star Trek saga.<br /><br />I am thoroughly impressed with this movie and the first one.  I hope they keep true to form and don't screw with the story line or the cast.  I was so please with how well they cast the actors, completely shocked actually.  I get teary after I watch each movie in the largest IMAX theater in 3-D that I can find in the state.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the story, but if you're a loyal fan, these movies are so awesome.  It is almost crazy to see what they have done with the story from the 1960s to today.<br /><br />You won't go wrong with this movie.
1439156816|5.0|I didn't intend to re-read \\"On Writing.\\"  I'd just sent a novel manuscript to the first agents and needed some encouragement. I've long loved Steven King's account of sticking all his early rejections slips on a nail in his bedroom wall and how, when it got too full, he replaced it with a spike.<br /><br />I inherited my first copy of \\"On Writing\\" from a friend and later passed on to someone else. A year later, I bought another copy and re-read it. That's the one I starting flipping through a couple days ago. The thing is, Stephen King writes so well that I can't put his books down--and I'm not even a fan of horror. It looks like I'm not alone. Since \\"On Writing\\" came out in 2000, 1402 people have reviewed it on Amazon, 3 of those in the last 2 days.<br /><br />The first third is a memoir, or as King titles it, a \\"C.V.\\" He writes about people and events in his early years that had a part in forming the writer he became. How can you not get engrossed in the story of a babysitter who fed 4-year-old Stevie 7 eggs and, when he \\"yarked all over the floor,\\" locked him in the closet? Then he says he didn't really mind being in the closet that smelled of his mother.<br /><br />The rest of the book consists of King's advice to aspiring novelists. Some writing instructors have criticized him for saying things like a novelist doesn't need to make elaborate plans before writing. I agree with the instructors about the value of novel mapping, but King clearly says this is what works for him. And let's face it: he's in an elite league. The book is a little dated in that it doesn't much address the publishing changes due to the internet, but how to write a good novel hasn't changed.  On that score, very few people can inspire like Stephen King.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I really lime it. Definitely worth buying. Yes, some parts get hard and some are REALLY easy. Busy it's definitely a GREAT game.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I used to play this game on the computer all the time. This is one of my favorite games ever. 10/10
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is a lot of fun works well an I hag only had maybe two glitches. I recommend this app to all horse and animal lover's.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|Great practical ideas whether just starting out or already on the journey to clutter- free living! Makes you want to put down the book and start sorting out your life!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Really is a great cable It is stronger not like the older one a much improvement.<br />The length is a big help to as I can plug it into an outlet and keep right on going<br />with what I am doing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show. While some episodes lead off by being predictable, they always tend to throw a curve ball at you. Mike Ross and Donna Paulson are my two favorite characters.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|I just watched this film and have to say that at times I felt it was drawn out and somewhat boring.  You never really felt the anxiety as in \\"The Company Men\\".  However, there is no doubt as to the stress and anxiety that the REAL man portrayed went through.  Hard work sometimes pays off and I'm glad it did here.  But, as the movie ended and it showed his future success, the question of \\"happyness\\" was never addressed.  Just because you have money doesn't mean you are happy.  Persoannly, I think \\"happiness\\" is overrated.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was clearly my sons favorite Lego set.  The set comes with a tool to remove the small pieces in case they get put together incorrectly or if you want to take the model apart.  My son is already looking at the other Minecraft sets.
B007LGPSX0|4.0|I like this shows.  That remind me back in those old days. You'll love this in 90s' and 00s' shows.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I enjoyed nearly every single song on this album. I was very disappointed when I heard about Adam leaving though.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Morgan Rice is my hero, she writes such page turners, she is like between the sword of truth series and game of thrones series. I have read the whole series and love it. Kids are going to love it too. Not racey but true fantasy. I enjoy everything she has written from the vampire to the quest of heroes. Now starting her series she just has two books out, can't wait!!
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Shinedown is certainly taking a different direction, but it sounds excellent. The whole album is fun to listen to, just like their earlier stuff.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland season 1 is an outstanding drama series.  But it is not for everyone.  The show is very dark and adult themed.  This is definitely not a show for the whole family.  But if you don't mind that, then you will probably find it to be an excellent show.  The drama is intense in the extreme and the acting is outstanding.  Claire Danes gives an incredible and very complex performance as Carrie Mathison, a barely stable CIA operative who is obsessed with a US Marine and former POW named Nicholas Brody, who she believes has been turned by al-Qaeda.  The show is worth watching for Daines' performance alone but there is much more here to like.  Damian Lewis is very good in the role of Brody.  Mandy Patinkin is simply riveting as Carrie's CIA mentor and Morena Baccarin is quite good as Brody's wife. The tension builds all throughout the first season as Carrie tries to convince her bosses at the CIA that Brody is not the war hero that everyone believes he is and is in fact an al-Qaeda sleeper.  I highly recommend this series for those who don't mind a dark and adult themed show.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I love Papa Roach, and I was not disappointed by this album. If this is your genre, look at the Avengers Assemble soundtrack as well.
B0055PMURG|5.0|It is an excellent show to share with my students after studying about her brave and strong recovery.  She is a true survivor.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Madonna's past concert CD's were cherry picked songs from her tour setlist, never the whole show!  This has the whole MDNA tour setlist from beginning to end.  Worth the price!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like that you can choose daily weekly or even hourly weather forecasts. It also is very easy to switch between cities or find new ones.
B00DQVST76|5.0|MDNA is a great show with tons of special effects, great songs, and poignant moments.  Pick it up and blast the speakers.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|you'll love the essence of this story. . .a true man saves cat/cat saves man story. . .so glad that Jim found Bob and that Bob transformed his life.  The writing is less impressive than the story, but then again, this is reality, not fiction.  'glad to have &#34;met&#34; Jim and Bob in this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really love this game. It has an interesting story and the actual hidden object part of the game makes a lot more sense than most other hidden object games where every room is piled high with junk that you would never actually find in those rooms.<br />That said, I use it on my kindle fire and I get frustrated with the game because sometimes it won't load or it will get stuck and then refuse to open or allow you to see anything on he screen.<br /><br />Aside from that it is great fun!
B007AL48UK|5.0|I enjoy playing this game because you never know the moves that you will have when you come back to the game.
B00E5CUWB6|5.0|How I enjoyed this concert back in the day in my VHS!  Now I have it on audio!  A must have!  UP THE IRONS!!!
B006M4F67A|5.0|this is the game that got me started on the Mahjong games on my Kindle thank you for this game
B008LZHA3G|5.0|While it is doubtless that much of Bob Dylan's 60s & 70s work will stand the test of time, there is good argument that his post 2000 recordings (sans the awkward Christmas album) are his best.  Perhaps it's specious to compare the songwriting talents of his youth with his mature art but Tempest goes a long way in underscoring that he is on an awesome 13 year roll.<br /><br />As Dylan's 60s work reflected the consummate cockeyed youthful slant on that era, his 21st century musings offer curious commentary from a more world weary wordsmith.  For word play, Early Roman Kings is up there with Highway 61, Narrow Way is as blues sharp as Maggie's Farm, Pay In Blood and Scarlet Town as foreboding as Desolation Row, Soon After Midnight as accesible as It Takes A Lot To Laugh.......<br /><br />The band behind him here is as muscular as any he's used in the studio and perfectly complements his ragged vocal delivery and the weight of his texts.  (Heavy but not without his signature humor.)  Tempest is the latest in a line of offerings, from Love & Theft on, where form is married brilliantly to function; band to songs, words to music, vocal delivery to message. (The much heralded last 2 songs, the Titanic tale and the John Lennon tribute, would be best left off the disc in my opinion, but even without them the prior 8 songs make for a solid full cd's worth.)<br /><br />If this was his last album, doubtful because he is nothing if not prolific, it is a magnificent swan song.  Maybe he should quit while he is ahead but that's not his game, he was never afraid to fail. He inspires to keep reaching til we're dead.  And this record swings, he is still making great rock n' roll and blues records.
B008602KQI|5.0|I gave &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; 5 stars because I found it to be a well written. evenly paced novel with a unique approach to the human condition. It is an absorbing study of &#34;grace under pressure&#34; that kept me reading to see its resolution. I bought this book at Amazon.com and am very glad I did !
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|A map would really help! I keep going around in circles. More fun to play in pairs. Someone with a good sense of direction is a good idea!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have been buying on Ebay and it is always been a great experience.<br />Now I recently sold my first item, and transaction went smooth and easy.<br />Love the app, since I can check everything from my phone.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I must give this woman credit for doing the almost-impossible.  She took off on the Pacific Crest Trail, totally unprepared.  Somehow she had the moxie to stay with it.  I always admire women who take on more than they think they can do and are successful at it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game!! One of the best apps I ever purchased, by far. I recommend it for horse lovers.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I think a teenager could have written a better book.  It's all about sex.  Only bought it because of all the hype.  Not much of a story plot.  I quit reading it about 1/4 way through.  Didn't interest me.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|good movie, great Bullock.  i highly recommend this movie to the general population out there.  give this one a try.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Very good and powerful movie. Would recommend to anyone.  This movie doesn't get old, I could watch it over and over.
140053271X|4.0|I have had my BN Nook Simple Touch for about a year now. I love it. It's simple to use. Light and easy to carry around. Things I have problems with is the fact that after only a year the screen isn't as sensitive and neither are the buttons. Occasionally I'll have to touch it more than once to turn the page. Additionally I don't have the Glow Light, but if the Glow Light was of better quality, I probably would have purchased that version instead. I could definitely use a light on my Nook.<br /><br />A Nook is definitely a great product if you're looking for a e-ink reader without the annoying backlight that you get from computers and tablets.
B000784WMW|4.0|I own 3 versions and this one is by far the closest one to the book compared to the other 2 that I have. I would have given it 5 stars except I don't like the way it's set up on the DVD as a total of 11 Episodes. Each episode having an intro at the beginning and credit scene at the end. This breaks up the movie 10 times  even if you choose the &#34;play all&#34; option, and is distracting and annoying. If you keep your remote control within reach, you can use the &#34;skip to next scene&#34; button to skip through the credits at least. Other than that, it is a wonderful version and if you've read the book you'll delight in how many details are in this version that are missing from others. Jane is Small, Pilot is Black/White, they do justice to the &#34;Gypsy&#34; scene, and many other scenes that are found lacking in the other movie versions. This is the longest version of the 3 that I own, being 5 hours and 11 minutes long. The first 3 hours and 21 minutes are on the front of the disc (Episodes 1-7) with the remaining 1 hour and 50 minutes (Episodes 8-11) being on the back side of the disc. So if you wish to watch it all at once you would need to set aside a good portion of your day for it. However, if you don't mind splitting it up into smaller watching portions, then perhaps the Episodial Arrangment may suite you just fine as it does lend itself to bite sized portions of the movie if you only wanted to watch one or two episodes per day.
B009DH2PP4|4.0|A wealth of knowledge for anyone interested in brewing beer. Kindle edition renders most tables useless though, I would really like an updated version with tables formated to fit kindle readers.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|If you don't feel like investing just over 5 hours watching the Timothy Dalton version, but wish a more detailed version than the 2 hour Mia Wasikowska version, then this delightful 3 hour and 48 minute version will suit you just fine.<br /><br />Toby Stephens is my favorite Mr. Rochester of the 3 movies I own. I was delighted to discover little Georgie Henley (aka Lucy from Narnia) as the young version of Jane in this rendition. It took me a little longer to bond with Ruth Wilson as Jane, she plays a much more outwardly emotional Jane than is usually seen for this normally quiet subdued character. While at first the true Jane Eyre fan in me rebelled against that aspect, by the end of the movie I'd come to love her as much as Mr. Rochester does. And in watching it through a 2nd time, knowing ahead of time what to expect, I found myself loving this version even more than when I watched it the first time.<br /><br />I highly recommend adding this version to your collection if you are a fan of the Jane Eyre story. If you've no prior experience with the Jane Eyre story then this would be a wonderful way to begin your experience with it.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in years!!  This good quality TV with a positive message for young and old alike.
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|I own 3 of the many versions of this movie. This is the shortest of the 3 and while it doesn't adhere as strictly to the book as the other 2 versions I've seen, it is wonderfully done if you can overlook the areas where it parts from the book. There are some major scenes missing from this version of the story which may disappoint the die hard Jane Eyre fans. However, if you know the full story you can easily enough fill in the blanks with your own memories. That said, I adore Mia Wasikowska in this role, she is a perfect Jane Eyre and hands down my favorite. The acting of everyone in this version is truly wonderful. The scenery and costumes are as beautiful. I love the dramatic way this movie starts, if you do know the story your heart will break for Jane from the opening scene, knowing what's happening. If you don't know the story then it will draw you in and you'll eagerly wait to find out what's happening. A &#34;must have&#34; for anyone who loves, or wishes to learn, the wonderful story of Jane Eyre.
B001AQO3XS|5.0|gave me imagination and a gift of a play.  I loved every episode of the Highlander's and I think everyone should enjoy and soak in.
B0053TMP24|5.0|The Percy Jackson series adds characters and keeps on going. I have enjoyed them all. This one kind of hints of a new series with Asian roots...I hope it happens. I am also a fan of the Kane Chronicles and highly recommend it too.
0307352145|5.0|I was born quiet and people know about you just by instinct when they are around you.  It is an amazing gift people with should embrace and enjoy as so the world enjoys life.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|book 4 of this series is not disappointing, it is carrying on, fast paced and keeping me interested. in the beginning of the series I was not sure about sticking with it through thousands of pages- but here I am on book 4 and still as engrossed and enthralled as in the beginning.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|Love this family movie. It definitely one I wanted to add to my collection.  Best price I've seen, got it for 19.99 instead of 35 dollars at best buy
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I felt entertained with the book the whole time I was in the land of stories with Alex and Conner on a journey of a lifetime
B00CFA222M|4.0|I was in the mood to be entertained, and Jack the Giant Slayer did the trick.  Nothing vulgar and something I watched with my grand kids..
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|A great alarm clock app. Does exactly what it says on the tin with a great alarm to wake you up. Has worked every time for me so far and has helped me in training for a mini-marathon! A great app.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It is incredibly scary, but has a great story. It's funny, smart and riveting. U highly recommend American Horror Story Asylum
1439130833|5.0|i've been reading one note everyday, really feel like its changing my life. Highly recommended for people who are looking for self discovery
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|As always, Chris Colfer's imagination is wonderful.  For anyone who enjoyed his first &#34;Land of Stories,&#34; this is a great continuation.  Just like the first book, I could not put it down.  He brought up a lot of the old characters in this book and added new ones.  These stories are not just for children as I am a grandmother so I would say they are for the young of heart!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Great product, my only wish, like the others of this type is that they were made of stronger (well heavier duty) materials so they do not feel like plastic toys in your hand. I understand that is what they are, but I for one would pay a little more for a higher quality replica.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|We go back to this over and over. It never gets old . . . it's like going back to a place from your past where you had a wonderful weekend.  Each actor's best performance ever.
B000QGAU4E|3.0|It was a decent movie. Its one of those that I thought would have been better than it ended up being, but it filled a gap in our evening where we had nothing to do otherwise it might have only been 2 stars.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|This is just what you expect from this franchise. My 8 and 13 yr old sons enjoyed it, as did I.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|He doesn't let the reader down.  His characters are believable, although not like anyone I know.  It's another interesting story.
0374533555|3.0|This book was very interesting.  It talks of how we make decision and how we think we are thinking the decisions out thoroughly but how our brain processes differently than what we might say.  For instance people who understand probabilities may bet on something even though the likelihood of it happening is very small.  whereas they should know not to waste there time.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Food for thought, keep an open mind.  Try to put your etch in stone beliefs aside, prior to becoming engage with the book. Bfg
1400069807|3.0|This book was very eye opening to the amount of processed food I did not really pay attention to.  Whether the scientist discover the Bliss point to completely hook us or we find out that salt is so cheap they put it in everything.  This was a very comprehensive study in the the why and how the Giants have hooked us.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I didn't expect much from this movie, having seen some reviews already. However, I liked Hoult in the zombie flick and I like Ewan McGregor, so I thought it was worth a try.<br /><br />The movie wasn't anything spectacular, and it did have dull moments. I still found it enjoyable enough to keep watching.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I enjoyed the latest Star Trek movie with all the special effects. It was very visual and fast paced. The story line kept referring to previous Star Trek movies and the Star Trek TV show which I love, so I was in Star Trek heaven. I can't wait for the next Star Trek movie.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I got this last year and it is so good I reset it and play it over and over again. When I beat again I am going to get gangstar Vegas the second one after this.
B00A72989U|4.0|Like most stars after they marry and have children, Alicia Keys has changed her music somewhat to fit her new life. I prefer her older albums; however, this new sound will attract anyone who has been a Keys fan for over a decade. And that gorgeous voice never changes.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was very good it me kept me wanting to know what happened next. BTW the movie was very good including the special effects.
B002R88G5E|4.0|I like reading stories and this story of Mariam and Laila, set in backdrop of Afghanistan war is a touching one.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|No doubt Chevy hits the mark... I can watch this movie everyday and still laugh. I a holiday and everyday standard.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Ok, this is officially my favorite puzzle game so far of Free Apps of the Day. The reason why is that you draw your own game board to solve each puzzle as you try to direct granules of sugar into cups.<br /><br />Not only do you have to figure out the right paths to draw, but you need decently good timing and some ingenuity too. You also have to take care how you draw your paths, as a little curve in your drawing style can become a hump that the sugar granules cannot roll past. Leave a path drawn a bit short and you waste your limited supply of sugar in spillage.<br /><br />The game is challenging and funny both at the same time. It's a clever concept delightfully realized in this game.<br /><br />I played it in a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with no issues.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I think the Uhura and Spock thing is getting old.  This is a star ship not a bed and breakfast.  I would like that edited out of the next movie.  The warp core restart scene was too much like the scene in the Wrath of Khan.  They must have left the radiation suits on earth.  They could have used one with a rocket pack attached.  I think more originality was needed here.  Other than that. Great special effects.  I was not expecting to see khan again but since we are in an altered time line then past villains will show up again.  Hopefully there will be new villains  and monsters while they are on their five year mission.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is so cool.<br />and blocky.<br />and I wish minecraft pocket edition was free and had redstone.<br />Minecraft pocket edition is great
B004UNX1LS|3.0|its a pretty cool app it just doesn't let me watch a video plus it freezes when it actually starts working. it was made tot I pods
B0063IH60K|4.0|This Solitaire Game is fun and easy to play without thinking. It's a simple game in a simple form. It works fine on my Kindle Fire HD and I love it. What should I say even more?
B001AQQR2S|5.0|This gorgeous film is a true classic.  My first love was for the book, and my second love is the movie, which does not disappoint.  Danny DeVito stars in this gem, and he also directed it, and the film has the perfect amount of kitsch, fantasy, classlessness and classiness.  It is timeless, in my opinion.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|This review is for the Blu-ray version of the BBT: Seasons 1-5.  My best friend sent me the first three seasons on DVD and I was hooked.  I had to get the following seasons.  I watched seasons 4 through 5 in Marathon fashion.  Very enjoyable. The characters are quirky and very funny. And they are very flawed, which is what makes them so fun to watch. Don't get me wrong, I don't like watching train wrecks - it's painful for me to watch that kind of stuff. But flawed and funny; well that's what makes all of the cast very easy to relate to and enjoy.  Who doesn't have a Sheldon-like character sometime in their life? Anyway, overall I very much enjoyed it. And I am now a fan.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I like this, but I am not 100% sure that my android Galaxy S4 uses the full charging capacity, as it will discharge while driving with navigation.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|I've been through every iteration of this saga. I think what's happened here is they have just gotten lazy, what little \\"originality\\" they manage is sad and pathetic. No originality. No forward looking. Just an extremely lame plot. Originality is dying in the movie industry. They're a bunch of hacks. I toyed with giving it +, but decided on ++, one for the movie, one for the blond. Pretty sad, and I've seen them all. I commend it to mediocrity.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|This is a cool, strategic game that gets a bit harder as you advance through the levels. At first I didn't know what this game was as I ran across it trying to find new apps to try. Then I tried it and I have fun with it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan delivers again in this book.  I love his style of writing, his character developments and his plots.  I think I learn more about Roman and Greek mythology through these then any others.  Oh and my kids love it to!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I loved Swype when it was first introduced. After prolonged use, I could sense it had some issues, but I couldn't quite put a finger on it. Swift Key flow &#34;gets&#34; those issues and addresses most of them.<br /><br />* I love that it has a choice of &#34;Hinglish&#34; language! I have never seen it in any other product ever before<br />* &#34;flow&#34; works just like Swype<br />* Predictive word. This is the by far the best feature. It predicts the next entire word based on the current one. For example, if I type &#34;better&#34;, it would predict &#34;than&#34;. I often can get-by without typing at all, just selecting the next and the next word in the sentence!<br />* Many choices of color schemes for the keyboard and the tracking line.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />* The tracking line for &#34;flow&#34; is raggedy... that's annoying to me. I would have liked a smooth line.<br />* Doesn't handle acronyms very well. It auto-corrupts them. If I try to track back to change one alphabet back, that is very hard. It selects the entire word and I often end-up deleting the entire word, when I just want to fix one alphabet some where in the middle. I end-up in a loop of entering text and deleting it. (But, it learns the acronym once I use it, so that's pretty good)<br />* Statistics - it stores data and shows how it helped the user, like how many words it predicted correctly. What it doesn't tell is how it annoyed the user... how many times it refused to correct the word for the user. that kind of biased record-keeping really annoys me!<br /><br />** Major problem - I linked swift key flow with all my accounts like Face Book, gmail etc. I had hoped it would learn names of my ethnic contacts, custom acronyms etc., which it did. However, it also learned some annoying words from swype! For example, swype always auto-corrupted &#34;meeting&#34; to &#34;metering&#34;. Well, Swift Key flow also learned it after linking it to all my accounts. I deleted all the data from the cloud, but it wouldn't unlink my account. I contacted customer support, and they said there is no way to unlink my accounts from it. That's very annoying. Hopefully, it will be fixed soon.<br /><br />Still, overall, this product is an upgrade over Swype, and I would certainly recommend it. I'm not going back to any other kind of keyboard from this.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Little slower then the other books and kind of just leaves you hanging at the end.  This is one of those transition books.  Not my favorite but still a great book in the series and good job continuing to develop the characters.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Clean, fantastic cast, well done with the great actors and their lines. My kind of movie where you have to pay close attention as the one-liners go flying by from the very beginning of the film. I wish more modern movies could be this funny without having to use the typical trash-talk that abounds today.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Action from the start to the end.  Great job brining all the story lines together.  Would recommend to continue with the series  to anyone.
B00908DDZM|5.0|there's not a song that I don't like.  great  music. I  just started  listening  to Macklemore  and  love this c.d
0425263924|3.0|Love the story and am now waiting for the next book, just think this book leaned too heavily on the sex scenes and gave you less story.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate the new weather app. The old one was so much better. It's a complete waist. I am looking for a replacement!
1609611543|4.0|Husband read it.  I haven't yet.<br />He thinks it's pretty good.<br />He's mostly cut out gluten, has lost weight and is no longer pre-diabetic.<br />I don't eat wheat/gluten either, but then I've had Celiac's for many years.<br />Anyway, the book was helpful for my husband, so we'd recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn keeps you guessing and she has a talent for uncanny turns in her spell-binding story. I have seldom read about female psychopats in such a skincreeping, unnerving plot. Never trust your lover! I look forward to her next novel.
1442444053|5.0|Actually looked much nicer than the picture.<br />Like a collector's item quality.<br />Bought it as a gift and the person was VERY pleased!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I just love this game!  It is so much fun!  If u like solving puzzles then you will love it!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Very addicting game kind of like looking for the prize in the cereal box . The app never freezes on the HD Kindle like other games. I am always looking for games that are not just for kids and this is one of them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|LOVE LOVE this game. My husband and I both play it,c and we love sitting next to eachother or randomly going up to each other and trying to get the other to mess up, or beat our scores. We are both majorly addicted to this game! My husband is a higher gamer, but I'm not and I'm so happy to have found a game we can play and challenge each other.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put it down, it brought up a lot of ethical questions which are great for a book club discussion.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|an interesting mix of harsh reality, humor, and hope - the petty or cruel presence of some characters balanced with the kindness or generous nature of others
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS BOOK ITS SUCH A PAGE TURNER IT WAS AMAZING JUST AWESOME I LIKE THE PART WERE PRESIDENT SNOW MURDERED HIM SELF
B0000026KQ|5.0|I bought the album for the song Big Block but the whole album smokes all the way through!! Definitely worth buying & having. This album is touted as one of his best & they weren't lying!! I'm very happy with it!!  ;o)<br />  Victor  ( RumblefishVic)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great for trivial data that you might need at your finger tips such as a part number, item size, or mundane details that don't stick in our memories, plus to do lists. More important is significant details or data to track, plus no more sticky notes!
B000002L68|5.0|This album sounds like garbage but its amazing. Every song is so good it should have its own museum. I hope that I live to see a very good remaster. I'm in my late 40's so please get a move on Prince. I was with you from the beginning. Please do it for your fans.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Fun, supernatural novel. I think this was a good start to a series and I am interested in where the mythology will head next
B009E3EY38|5.0|I'm not a Led Zeppelin fan whatsoever.<br /><br />I purchased this as a gift for my dad who is a big fan.  However, just from an outsider's perspective on the product, I can say that if you are a LZ fan, this package has a lot of special features and different forms of media for your viewing & listening pleasure.  The digital content is a bonus.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Not perfect, but engaging, thoughtful and unique. The Bailey storyline feels added to the main plot. Not sure I'm sold on his role.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|For some reason l have avoided this game for years, boredom led me to play and I'm hooked.  Should have started much sooner.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book disturbed me. It was interesting. It was a page turner, but in the end I thought, &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; It made me wonder about the author's mental health. Seriously.
B001EBWING|5.0|Casablanca should be on everyone's top ten list. One of the most romantic and charming movies ever made. Looking a little long in the tooth by modern standards but still great
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Really great book, but I found myself desperately wanting to get back to Maud's storyline. I wasn't interested as much in the other characters.
B00CB3N5DS|2.0|It was an ok movie.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if I'd heard less hype about it from my social circle.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Another great, and easy to use, product from Google. Hopefully, they will add more apps that it will work with. But, for the $35.00, it was well worth it.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|Although the only other version I have only seen is the 1974 version (pretty boring) I'm sure this is the most exciting interpretation of the story. This is pretty much everything you would expect from flamboyant director Baz Lurhmann with the added influence of producer Shawn Carter (Jay-Z).<br /><br />It is obvious Jay wanted his fingerprints to be clearly visible on this film as many of his songs are noticeably played throughout. This is probably the movies most controversial point as it is a period piece, though if you know and like the way Baz Lurhmann's movies are, this is probably something you have already come to expect. The atmosphere of the movie is like that of a party you've always wanted to go to but never been invited. Visually it's stunning in almost every single shot (largely due to green screen and other digital effects).<br /><br />While the plot is not new, the way it was written this time made it far more interesting from a storytelling aspect. Lurhmann has a fantastic tendency to romantisize any personal encounters, this works quite well for this film particularly.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|The movie is corny, the acting was pretty bad all around (inc. that of Lena Headey, who is usually good in everything), the plot is rather slow for an action movie, and some of the special FX was very 80's looking.<br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. I honestly don't know why some people like it.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|loved it! This was a buy movie for sure. Nice twist, and who dont love magic. love, love love it!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I downloaded this when it was FAOTD, but it took me about a month to actually try it. Once I did, I wondered what took me so long!<br /><br />This game is somewhat tetris-like in the basic mechanics - different shapes fall from the top of the screen and you try to fill entire rows to make them disappear from the playing field, so that there is room for new shapes to fall.<br /><br />There are lots of differences between this and tetris, however; the key one in my opinion that makes it more enjoyable is that you have all the time you need. In a sense this is a turn-based game. You make a move and blocks fall down, but nothing happens until you do make a move. The pace is as fast as you want it to be. To me that is what makes this one more playable than tetris, and if you don't like tetris, you MIGHT actually enjoy this (depending on what it is you don't like about tetris). For those who like time pressure, there is a survival mode where blocks fall every 10 seconds whether you've moved or not.<br /><br />The progression of difficulty in infinite mode (play till you lose) is just right. Rather than speeding up, the game adds larger blocks (making it harder to fill small gaps) and some special blocks that have different effects and add challenge (such as the 'magnet' that doesn't fall; all you can do is destroy it by filling its line). There is a good mix of luck and skill involved, and when you lose, there is a big feeling of \\"I want to try that again.\\" You can play for a short time and pause and come back to where you were, or you can lose yourself and find you've been playing for an hour straight.<br /><br />If there is one downside, it may be that there is a limited amount of playability. Once you get to a certain level, you've encountered all the 'special' bricks that there are, you've got some strategies worked out, and the difficulty is just increasing by increasing the quantity of blocks that fall, and some of the fun just goes out of it because there's nothingnew to be accomplished.<br /><br />Visually the game is appealing. I always mute games so I won't comment on the music or sound effects.<br /><br />I'd say it's worth buying and will give you several hours of enjoyable play.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It gets you dragged in and i really like it. Since i play a lot of games it makes me drawn to this game each time i play on my kindle fire hd.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is the second book about life in North Korea that I have read. The author's interviews with the defectors In this book, brings each person alive to the reader. Their stories are sad and poignant. North Korea is truly an unfortunate, uncivilized, and unnecessarily hungry place to live. Hopefully someday, human rights organizations will be allowed more access to this land, in order to better the plight of its people.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is great!! I love it! I'm glad my husband down loaded it. I can't put it down. I have to say my favorite room is ghost town.
B00BEWF5IK|5.0|Good movie. great story. Jake & Reese did great with their roles. This kinda tells you why American government always tells you why \\"we don't torture\\" in this country!. supporting actors, were good as well. some action and is to b expected, when is about terrorism and how they go about teaching and brain washing people to blow themselves up for the good of Allah!, so they say. Meryl Streep in it for a short while playing a bitch and good at it, like always, she's always good no matter what she plays. recommended highly. not for kids.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|plot twist is perfect. definitely in love. gonna read the whole bunch of the mortal instruments. 100% worth buying ;)
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner was the first book of three.  It may seem to start out a little slow but once you get into this book you can't stop until you have finished the third book.  I'm hoping for a fourth.  Definitely a great read.  I liked it better than the Hunger Game series.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS CHANGED MY LIFE AND STOP LOOKING AT MY REVIEW JUST BUY IT UGH IT IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT

B005K17RU0|5.0|when yahoo changed their local weather coverage for the worst weather coverage locally I've experienced, I went looking on my kindle and found AccuWeather...It's perfect!  I especially like the local radar map showing thunderstorms on the way.  Yahoo weather used to have that but it was always behind by 3 hrs. and now they deleted it completely.  AccuWeater app is always current.  I love that.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i was so in love with this book that i read very little everyday bc i couldnt even bear the thought of finishing such a wonderful and perfect book omg
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Farmville was always my favorite game, but constantly froze my computer.  Zynga knows of these problems but does nothing to fix it, so when I found Family Farm and now Family Farm Seaside for my Kindle, I was delighted!!!I have the option of playing their way or my own way because I don't like quests! My aim is to build it as big as I can NOT doing their quests, the challenge is more fun.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|definitely perfect! cant love it more. i was really moved with the story, and its a great book for people no matter what age.
1250030951|5.0|***Review posted on The Eater of Books! blog***<br /><br />Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell<br />Publisher: St. Martin's Press<br />Publication Date: September 10, 2013<br />Rating: 5 stars<br />Source: eARC from NetGalley/Finished copy sent by the publisher<br /><br />Summary (from Goodreads):<br /><br />Cath is a Simon Snow fan.<br /><br />Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan . . .<br /><br />But for Cath, being a fan is her life -- and she's really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it's what got them through their mother leaving.<br /><br />Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.<br /><br />Cath's sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can't let go. She doesn't want to.<br /><br />Now that they're going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn't want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She's got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words . . . And she can't stop worrying about her dad, who's loving and fragile and has never really been alone.<br /><br />For Cath, the question is: Can she do this?<br /><br />Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?<br /><br />And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?<br /><br />What I Liked:<br /><br />I don't... I don't even know where to begin with this book. I read this book, starting on a Tuesday night, and finishing on the Wednesday evening, and then I moved in as a freshman in college of Thursday. I mean, call it fate, or God, or a coincidence, or whatever you want, but it was literally the PERFECT book I could have randomly decided to read right before I left to be a college freshman myself.<br /><br />This book is the LAST book I read before I moved in. It's incredible how that worked out. If Rowell wrote this book, if St. Martin's Press set the publication date for what it is, if I got that opportunity to read this book early... that was for me, you all. I mean, I just feel like all of that worked out for me, perfectly.<br /><br />You see, Cath and her sister Wren are moving into college. On the very first page, Cath is moving in. Cath and Wren are twins, and were inseparable, until they finally arrive at college. Wren insisted on NOT rooming with Cath. Cath is a bit antisocial, and she spends all of her time writing fanfiction. She doesn't make friends well, and doesn't leave her room often.<br /><br />Wren is the opposite. She is outgoing, social, a party girl, a risk taker, willing to talk to anyone, try anything, etc. Wren is totally ready to forget life at home, where their dad is slightly unstable, mentally. Wren does get in contact with their mother, who left them for like, ten years, or something. Cath worries all the time about their dad, but hates their mom.<br /><br />So, this book seems to be about several things. It's about Cath and Wren, and their changing relationship as twins and friends and sisters. It's about Cath and Levi, the cute boy who seems to be everywhere Cath is. It's about Cath coming out of her shell, and growing into herself. It's about Cath and her family, making choices with father and basically nonexistent mother.<br /><br />Cath and Wren are so different, and their relationship takes huge hits in college. Wren ignores Cath, Cath doesn't respond to Wren BECAUSE Wren is ignoring Cath sometimes, Cath worries about Wren, Wren thinks Cath is too clingy and invasive... they are different people, but they need each other more than they realize.<br /><br />Cath and Levi are the best couple. It's not about hot, steamy chemistry between the two of them. Levi is so adorable, and an all-around good guy. He's a few years older than Cath, but he is so great. Their relationship is hilarious and gorgeous. I seriously loved watching the two of them fall in love, and watching their relationship progress. Nothing was rushed, but everything was totally THEM. Totally Cath and Levi.<br /><br />Cath has to learn a lot in this book. All she wants to do is write fanfiction, and she seems to hate college, because she's so consumed by writing. She doesn't even enjoy her writing class at times. But, she begins to see that there is more to college than fanfiction. There is more to writing than fanfiction.<br /><br />Cath's relationship with her father is so amazing. I mean, she always did what any responsible, caring daughter would do, when her father was in trouble, or needed anything. The same goes with Cath helping Wren (though Wren did not want Cath's help, often). I could totally understand why Cath couldn't get over her hatred of her mother. I mean, I probably wouldn't like the woman either, if she left when parenting got too hard, and then tried to come back and establish a relationship with the girls.<br /><br />I seriously don't know what else to say about this book. It's one of the books that are so amazing, and so powerful, and so beautiful, that you don't know how to describe it, or write about it, or comment on it. There isn't much of a climax in this book, but I liked that, because it seemed like this book was about Cath, her life story, and that doesn't necessarily need a climax.<br /><br />I love this book. I love it. And I love the timing of it, with my life. I mean, it couldn't have been more perfect.<br /><br />What I Did Not Like:<br /><br />I seriously have nothing to say. It's long? But the length didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />Would I Recommend It:<br /><br />TOTALLY. Anyone can read and love this one (unless you're looking for nasty crazy college-student NA contemporary romance sex. Not happening in this one). I think people like me (incoming freshmen) should read this book right before going to college. It gave me a different look on college.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />5 stars - 5 perfect, unadulterated stars. I can't even begin to describe how much I loved this book. I hope you read it and love it as well! Now, I have to go read Rowell's other books.ble, and an all-around good guy. He's a few years older than Cath, but he is so great. Their relationship is hilarious and gorgeous. I seriously loved watching the two of them fall in love, and watching their relationship progress. Nothing was rushed, but everything was totally THEM. Totally Cath and Levi.<br /><br />Cath has to learn a lot in this book. All she wants to do is write fanfiction, and she seems to hate college, because she's so consumed by writing. She doesn't even enjoy her writing class at times. But, she begins to see that there is more to college than fanfiction.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Often when reading a long series, the level of enjoyment dies as the author loses control of the action, starts to pad with unfocused plot lines and lets characters go stagnant.  But Martin keeps adding layers and layers to characters, keeping them fresh and intriguing.  The intertwined stories never drag and it is not hard to keep each separate story straight while enjoying the interaction.  I would have enjoyed more detailed maps to help with spatial relationships but that was never a serious problem.  I look forward to seeing how well all of this plays out in the television show as soon as I finish the books.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Both my kids love horses and really enjoy this app and play it pretty much daily!! I only wish that some of the gear and clothing weren't so expensive so my little ones could actually buy stuff.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I have not read the Dredd comics and am not in any way an expert on that. I came to this movie looking for 90 minutes of escapist entertainment and I judged the movie on its own merits, not versus the Dredd comics. On that basis, it met my expectations. It definitely earned an &#34;R&#34; rating for the violence. Frankly, I could have done with a little less of that BUT it was clear that the extreme nature of the villains demanded extreme measures to stop them. Karl Urban was appropriately dour for the entire movie. He had a tough acting job since he never removed his helmet so we never saw his eyes. I was not familiar with Olivia Thirlby (Judge Anderson) but I thought she played her part well. Bottom line: It was good enough that I would probably watch a sequel.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It's been a loooong 6 years & change since Justin Timberlake has brought his fans new music.  However, that had a 0% effect on his \\"comeback\\" album The 20/20 Experience.  Together again with the 2nd best producer alive Timbaland, a album was made unlike any typical \\"fist pump\\" type of pop album secretly.  As a result, creating a Incredible 70 min mission that became the BEST selling album in iTunes history, which is only the 1st half of the full project.  With outstanding production of each lengthy track & singles like Suit & Tie (featuring JAY-Z), Tunnel Vission & the MTV Video of the Year Mirrors; its safe to say JT is home like he's never left!
B00BG6MR0S|2.0|Imagining that I must have read this book when it was first published, I thought I give it another read now that I am in my 60's.  I can't believe that this book was so popular, as I found it almost unreadable.  While the basic narrative of a motorcycle journey through the West was fine, the deep philosophical discussions of \\"quality\\" almost drove me over the edge.  I was determined to finish the 500+ page book, and did, but I can't say that it was worth the time invested.  Sure, maybe it is me--maybe I'm not the type to appreciate this book, but with a Master's Degree, I am not uneducated.  I love to read, and am very curious about many subjects.  I just can't imagine millions of \\"regular, everyday people\\" actually reading this book from cover to cover.  Maybe we need a \\"Dummies\\" version, that cuts out 250 pages of tortuous philosophical discussion.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This, to me, was the perfect puzzle game. It really has intricate puzzles. Very well thought out, yet not so difficult as to be intimidating. Can't wait for the follow up. DEFINITELY will buy.
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|This app offers a steady and reliable stream of good puzzles to solve.  Some puzzle apps are inconsistent and sometimes arbitrarily difficult - things you could never solve without a hint - but Buttons and Scissors never disappoints!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great game and loads of fun. Love to evolve all the species and see how their colors develop. The missions are fun and managable - at least so far.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Once one has read a Jack Reacher book, the plots are fairly self explanatory. Get involved by accident and uses hs wits and braun to win over the day and the damsel in distress,
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am enjoying this mahjong on my KindleFire. the icons are clear, the game is quick and has options for timed play just to add a little challenge.
B004SMDJ9U|1.0|I ordered the first three seasons of  \\"Haven.\\"  After watching part of Season One:<br />HUGE disappointment!  It's too predictable, lacking details and reasonable plot ingredients, and (big con) does not end the episodes with any lead in to the next episode.  So who cares to be sure to watch.  The shows do have beautiful scenery.  I am hoping that the episodes will get better like \\"Primeval New World\\" did in its final three episodes.
1451695195|5.0|I have a friend who lost her son to suicide and a nephew who has ALS.  When things are dark and frightening, this book gives hope.  It is an amazingly easy book to read and I find it very believable.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is one of those albums you can listen to start to finish.. Love this CD. Track 12 is my fav.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love it but I would get the full ferzoun this one you can only 1 chareter so get this then get the full verzion my dathter loves it
B00BU18U82|5.0|This game is amazing.It is a wonderful tractor farming game.I would recommend this game to anyone. Thank you to whoever made this.
B00E1L9N8E|2.0|This was a disappointment.  Why did they pick such a plain Jane for daisy. It just wasn't believable.  I hated the modern music choice's as well.  I also thought the amount of people that came to those parties was not realistic.  It is not a movie I would watch again. It was painful enough the first time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I'm a John Grisham fan from the get go. Haven't read any of his books that I didn't thoroughly enjoy!
B003LD3N16|1.0|This video was a gift for a birthday and it would not work.!! It was lousy and would not work on any kind of player
B009WO7NQO|1.0|when I updated the game today I was excited then when I opened it all I got was a black screen and sent back home.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have nothing bad to say about Downton Abbey.  So good I couldn't wait for it to come out on netflix!
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I have a hard time swallowing the premise that Jesus was nothing but an illiterate country bumpkin that decided to take on politically the power that was Rome.  Even more so is the notion that his life and teachings were coopted by Paul and the Gospel writers to twist Him from a revolutionary to the Prince of Peace we recognize today.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This isn't classic literature, but it is a fun, easy read.  Predictable, but kept my attention the whole way through!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite solitude game. I especially like playing the winning games because, if I don't win, I know I should have and keep trying. I can also see how others have done.
1932100660|5.0|This book should be must reading for every primary care physician and nutritionist in the country. The vested interests won't like this one! With the scientific knowledge contained in this book and &#34;the Fast Diet&#34; by Dr. Michael Mosley (using the 5/2 Fasting Diet) and, Dr Esselstyn's, Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease, not only would we eliminate and prevent most individuals from the big three major causes of death and disability (heart disease, cancer and diabetes/obesity) without medication, but the shift large scale diet modification would require in agriculture would do much to heal earth's dangerously ailing environment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My family has a lot of fun with this game. I got this for my kids and I play it more. Lots of fun and a time killer.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book  it kept my attention could not put it down until I finished it, but did not care for the end.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I love this movie...see it years ago in the on the big screen and its been one of my favorite movies ever since. It's true though when people say the books are better than movies. I learned so much more about all the characters and their relationships with each other.<br />I now have a greater appreciation for the movie and can't wait to watch it again.<br />I will most definitely be reading the other books that follow this one. Like Little Men! :-)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 5 year olds love horses and they love this game. It's pretty easy for them to complete the tasks and there are a lot of different things to do. My only complaint is that I wish there were better instructions on some of the tasks, it's been kind of a trial and error way of figuring out how some games work.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I would truly rate this game 5 stars if it weren't for the feeling that I had just been had for paying 4.99 to finish what I started. Why did I do it? Because the storyline, puzzle, and hidden objects were enough to draw me in and get me hooked. Still, great game and graphics are not likely to catch me again with plenty of other great games for under 2 bucks with all the same qualities...
B0052GACNM|4.0|I'm not a Tony Bennett fan but bought the album anyway because of a few songs that I like and to my surprise, I enjoy the whole album.
B00D4ABW82|5.0|I like this album so much I've been listening to every album again.  Although some say &#34;it's not the same&#34; or &#34;go back to your first album's sound&#34;.... It's called maturing, people.  Bands do that.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Enjoyed the movie once Prime streaming finally quit the &#34;buffering&#34; stop & start.  Would have enjoyed more if I had just rented it from Blockbuster.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|The story was entertaining and held some mystery and twists.  The narration, however, always kept me from feeling a part of the story.  Maybe it's just a different story telling style I'm not fond of experiencing, but I could never make myself care enough about the characters to feel involved with or concerned over them in the book.
B003F256T0|5.0|Did any of you realize how much it originally cost? If not, let me tell you. It cost between $40 to $50 dollars when it was issued. Surprise!? Unfortunately, I am not lying. You can check the old price from other online toy stores too.<br /><br />The only reason it cost about $100 now is all because of Simple Economics 101 \\"Supply and Demand\\". Too much demand and not enough supply generated a shortage which pushes the product price to extreme. Moreover, there is no substitutes to buy. The price will only stay or even go up more. I am not encouraging you not to buy it. If you are so loyal to DBZ S.H Figuarts and your \\"willingness to pay\\" is over $60, then please go ahead.<br /><br />In my opinion, I know Tamashii Nations has reissued the Super Saiyan Son Goku earlier in this year due to popular demand. We all know how popular Gohan is, so there is a great possibility that they will reissue Gohan next year or maybe even in this year. Therefore, I rather wait until the reissue comes. Even if there is no reissue, I will wait for the Super Saiyan \\"Adult\\" Gohan and get that instead. I mean it is still Super Saiyan Gohan after all. It's up to you guys to decide though.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|This a true story movie and it is very well picturised and the casting is just superb.its a must see movie.
1454704225|5.0|If you are into art journals, this book gives great suggestions for doodles.  I love it!<br />Great illustrations and tips.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Daniel Silva always writes a good yarn full of adventure and intrigue.  The story takes place in Europe and it is obvious the author has done his homework and visited all the sites giving an added bit of credibility to the story.  He brings in the art world and all of his usual characters which gives it a feeling that you are visiting old friends.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Having enjoyed Hosseini's previous two books, I looked forward to his latest writing.  Though I liked the overall story, I did find the abrupt changes in characters, places, timing of events from chapter to chapter somewhat confusing and distracting.  However, on my second reading, the overall plot and the characters became a cohesive story and I became a fan of Hosseini once again.  I appreciate the rich portrayal of each of the main characters and through the storytelling, helping the reader gain some understanding the varying aspects of Afghan life and culture, both past and present, and the universality of the struggle to find oneself and fit in whether in one's mother country or elsewhere in the world.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|One of the best books on marriage. God bless u for writing such an insightful message on love and living fulfilled marriage.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My kids love this game sometimes I play it also<br />It keeps them busy for hours definitely worth the download!
B00D0Z2J10|5.0|This movie is awesome! The story sticks well from beginning to ending. The characters are themselves throughout the whole movie, and it's just awesome! Can't wait for Akira Toriyama to come out with a series, or the next movie!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The situation I ran into with my purchase of Chromecast is that it is not supported by the samsung chromebook I purchased at the same time. I will be returning the chromecast if I don't find a solution  for  my problem.
B00CTT9646|3.0|If your going to display the Phaser, I suggest, not let anyone touch it.  The Phaser looks okay from a distance.  But the quality is lacking.  It is full size, some what heavy and solid feeling. But the one I recieved, the pieces was not aligned, off balance and just looked slapped together and painted with cheap model paint. I quess an additional $50-$60, on top of the 3D blu-ray combo price, is not a terrible price for what you get.  I feel reminded of &#34;You get what you pay for!&#34;<br /><br />Star Trek Fan, J.D.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Note: I've changed this review a few times, and this is the last change.<br /><br />Okay, so at first I gave it a 3 because I wasn't impressed wih it, and the flashbacks were annoying.<br /><br />Then, I gave it a 4 because after Cas came back, things got more interesting.<br /><br />Then, the last few episodes and the ending were SO GOOD that I gave it 5 stars after all. That was AWESOME! Also, it's even better the second time around (so was season seven) because more questions are answered.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I first saw this at the Sundance Film festival and couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd. it is very interesting and has a lot of different bands that used sound city over the years. There is some harsh swear words in it. I think it is very well done!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have just discovered the Big Bang Theory within the last year or so and am now a die hard fan. I love the show and all of its characters. I look forward to watching it every week. I also watch the reruns every chance I get.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the show!! The plot is well written, the characters are wonderfully played and the period costumes are spot on. I also like that it is something you can watch with your family. I did not care for the ending because Matthew was my favorite character on the show.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Would choose 5 stars but  thought it was a little too convoluted. The storyline did make me think about my own \\"what ifs\\" .
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I watched this for JGL and it was a very interesting movie. I got lost a few times but I will have to watch it again.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|I'm young, but a bit of a movie buff. I went to see this with a friend. And when it finished, we were both AMAZED at how much we loved the movie. We spent the next 25 minutes on our walk home talking about how good it was, and both quickly added it to our favorite movie list.<br /><br />The movie was unpredictable, it kept you on your toes, and I'm not one to ever be surprised by a plot, but this movie caught me off guard.<br />The actors portray their characters perfectly, the effects of the movie are stunning, and the overall plot was very original.<br /><br />A MUST-SEE.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I couldn't wait until number 6 came out, I had finished the first 5 and was excited to see number 6.  Very addicting.  Can't wait for number 7.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is an awesome hack'n slash rpg. Gameloft really comes thru with this one!! Five stars all the freakin way!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This the best game ever. I absolutely love it or was totally worth it I love it . I have already got to level 43 there is so much to do you can even play games with the money .you can also go to canterlot.
0790737345|4.0|a movie that touched my heart and brought some spiritual questions to mind.  thoughtful and gentle suggesting questions about an angels or persons role in life.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|The movie has it's great magic trick moments that can awe but for the most part it's ok.  If you've watched everything else you've ever wanted to see, go ahead and watch this.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|The most recent filming of Jane Austen's novel of Emma, this series is beautifully executed and faithful to the novel.
1451695195|3.0|Not a bad write----never got down to what heaven is or isn't.  I never felt like the author was showing me any &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|I love it its so cool it comes with a bonus cd with reminds and acoustic singing. If you love Taylor swift as much a me you will love the cd.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It is Star Trek at its best! What's not to love. The picture is great, the sound is great! I love it!
B005HSL626|5.0|We first tried the free HD version of this on the iPad but only  the Classic and Multiplayer is available there. This one's got the Classic, Zen and Arcade Modes and we can also avail of Gustu's Cart. My son and I compete on the Arcade Mode.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this after my Xbox 360 broke on me and its been one of the best purchases I've made. I really like how small and compact it is!!! The only thing that needs improving is the rewind and pause response. Other than that its an excellent product.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was great too pass the time. i really enjoy unlocking all the different mini games. it is easy enough that you dont get frustrated
B008M7JODC|5.0|I am absolutely in love with all of the characters! The story is very intriguing! Definitely recommend it to all!
B00499QUK2|5.0|I find nothing lacking in this show. Each episode has been enormously entertaining. Season 2 is excellent also. I hope it continues.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love all the books & I actually got into them after the movie which I liked as well. I am looking forward to more books & movies if more are made :-)
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Hugh Laurie has been keeping his musical talent a bit of a secret. I missed the House series but this is an even better replacement.
B00C3JU7D6|5.0|I'll admit, I wasn't an overly huge fan of FOB before; I mean, they had some songs here and there that I really liked. But after listening to this album, I have to change that. This has skyrocketed to one of my all-time favorite modern albums. The first day I heard this album, I listened to it at least four times. I bought the vinyl the next day and received it two days later. When I opened it up, I was surprised to find my two favorite things in vinyl: clear vinyl and red colored vinyl! This 10-inch double LP album comes in CLEAR RED vinyl... how awesome is that!!<br />This album rocks and has definitely saved rock and roll for me!!
B003OUXECE|4.0|I always wanted to know how Rapture came to be and what life was like before Jack came along. I think this satisfied that curiosity so well. Great character development, integration of game dialogue and glimpses into Rapture history. I want more!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|This is one of the best albums JM has put out yet! There is a definite change in his voice since throat surgery but its a very pleasant change. I haven't stopped listening to the album sine I purchased it!
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|I wasn't crazy about this game, but then again I don't like Angry Birds.<br /><br />It is an easy game to understand, you just free the bugs by clicking on the strands of web. The graphics are nice and 'cute'.<br /><br /> I played it on my Kindle Fire and I had no problems; no freezing or hang-ups. It just wasn't my kind of game.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|The first film looked like a modern take on an old TV show and was OK.  This one was worse and not worth owning unless you are a Star Trek fan.  Aside from the leads looking ugly (Kirk looks like a frog), the sole black woman being in helpless love with an alien, the old 60's clothes should have been jettisoned. Aside from the ugly leads, the clothes single handily ruins the film.  Why would an army go around in shirts?  The clothes and guns still have that 1960's look to them.  This is one of the reasons I always liked Star Wars better than ST.  SW looked futuristic but the weapon looked believable.<br /><br />I saw 1960's looking phasers, pants and shirts.  Why have that in it with all of the CGI?  In fact, the CGI does not help expand the scope of ST because the TV show's appeal was wrapped around the stories due to the lower budget.  You know, when you have less money you concentrate on a better story.  When you have more money you concentrate on special effects and less story.  They should end this right here.  There is a reason why the 1979 ST expanded it's scope and changed the uniforms (besides SW having been out), it is because the 1960's clothes were unique to those times and only cool to those who lived through it.<br /><br />The story is nothing more than the Wrath of Khan, but less creepy and played by a white guy (British at that) this time, which kind of takes away from the guy being names Khan.  The grand admiral (Peter Weller.  I thought he was a professor?) has a blond haired, blue eyed British daughter.  Explain to me how this is possible.  I get tired of Hollywood inserting the random British person in films and acting as if we should not question why they are British!  I do believe that they make their own movies right?  I don't see random Americans in their films!  In fact, I don't see any at all!<br /><br />Now to JJ Abrams.  It is sad that they picked this guy to direct the next Star Wars film instead of a Christopher Nolan, who emphasizes story and feasibility in his films.  Look what he did to the once silly character of Batman. He made that believable. Abrams is not a good director at all and if it were not for CGI, there would be nothing about this film that would make you think quality.  Abram's main shots seem to be one or two persons on screen with close angles - that's really it.  He never gives us a true scope of a film and his films don't seem complete either.  I seriously think that George Lucas is better.  Hopefully Disney will come to their senses and get someone more capable.  On top of that, you never want to have a guy who directed Star Trek do Star Wars, which requires much more skill.  Ah well, hopefully it will be for only one film and at least George Lucas does not have to have his name attached to anything but the story.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|What I like about this app is that you click on the blue icon and it shows you exactly how much battery you have left. I like it because it is quick and simple. I'm sure there are other features, I just want to see quickly how much I have and the visual battery picture is a bonus.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Best iron man ever!! I don't know how they are going to out do this movie. I can't stop watching it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have watched from the beginning. Sorry to see Dan Stevens (Mathew Crawley) leave the show. Looking forward to Season 4.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love being able to determine the weather where our grown adult children live, the forecast for our areas, all on our Smartphones!  Wonderful!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It's Star Trek, what more can I say. I have been watching Star Trek since it began in the 60s and I have seen all the different series and have enjoyed them all. I saw this in the theater. I have seen all the movies in the theater and I have them all on DVD so that I can watch them over and over again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to post pictures on Facebook with my iPad or SmartPhone anytime, anywhere.  I especially like being able to stop receiving unwanted pictures from people who use Facebook for a porn site!  Some people just don't have common sense!  I can see my grandchildren's videos such as riding their bikes and new friends.
B008220BLG|5.0|a light hearted approach to an over saturated genre, at its depth its a chick flick, but enough for the fella's to get something out of it also, Nicholas Hoult did a tremendous job of playing an undead/alive zombie, love it
B005HSL626|1.0|I didn't like it because it is just about as boring as watching paint dry. I would not recommend this
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The show is intriguing, suspenseful and has a few twists to keep you interested. Cannot wait for Season 4 to start
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great it got Changes once in a while and you can create a world how ever you want. It Is worth the money!!!!!!!
B007THA4FI|3.0|She's a wonderful writer, of course, and the book has its messages--but I don't need these particular messages ... and all of the characters are unlikable. Now, The Cuckoo's Calling is &#34;a different story,&#34; loved it. Didn't love this one.
B000001FFR|5.0|Classic Anthrax. Although I prefer some of their more recent albums like &#34;Worship Music&#34;. &#34;Spreading the Disease&#34; Has that classic Anthrax sound and is an excellent compilation.
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|It still sounds the same musically, but Ian Gillian's voice is much more high and nasally then it used to be.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Awesome game!!! Graphics are good, though it would be better if dust and more effects are added.. few bugs...but hopefully y'all can fix it:)
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|If you are a fan of old fashioned, in your face, Blues, this 2 CD set is for you. All the guest's like Keith Urban, and all but the rhythm section of Aerosmith made it that much better!!!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I was sadly disappointed.  The previews made it seem more like a thriller.  It was a slow moving movie.  Just okay.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Queen is the very best in rock and roll! I was just a little disappointed that there were several duplicate songs, remix and original, thought they could do better with song choices. Still great! Love Queen!
B001BWYZWA|5.0|This is such an inspiring story and I get a lift out of it ever time I watch it.  Great acting and such a slice of Notre Dame history.  Highly recommended.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I purchased these to transfer photos from my SD card to my iPad. It worked great. So glad I found these.
B0021L9ME6|4.0|No, it is not Oscar material.  No it is not even Halle Berry's best movie.  But there is something that has always appealed to my superhero gene about this movie (and it's not just Halle Berry eye candy).  I like the story.  I like the acting.  Just take it for what it is intended - a fantastical story about a women who comes back to life because of the mystical powers associated with cats.  You don't need Batman involved to like this movie.  Recommended.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|bigger thumbs... bigger screen. Haven't got to the higher levels yet. Trying for a playthru without having to buy intake stuff...so far so good! !
B0061TQBRK|5.0|great recording and best album yet by an interesting band.  sounds thick and full with nice harmonies and songwriting. recommend.
B0049J0CTM|4.0|This movie has been a watched in my home for years. Fun for my entire family. We let it run when the kids are in the room
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a story I will remember for a long while. Could not stop reading once I started. Thank you Mr. Howey, for sharing these characters and their lives with us.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is a great app because it makes u think a lot more than u usually do and it is just fun
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I enjoyed the book so much I bought the other books . Good story line and the characters are loveable
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It is the best! It is worth it! Sometimes when I play this game I am so good at it that I get scared when Slender pops up out of no where!
B00CX7OW1G|2.0|The photography and locations are wonderful but the actors are wasted in what is basically a very long ad for no product at all.  Lots of navel gazing and internal monologues regarding the breakdown of a couple.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Love this app.really makes you think plus its free don't listen to the other people they are lying well some
B004LWZW24|4.0|Film had a few corny moments with the demon chasing but its a classic creeper that breaks out the spooks.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I have this app on my phone as well but I prefer the kindle version.  It really helps to keep me organized as I am a perpetual list maker.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|A lot of well known actors and a lot of great tunes. But I just couldn't get into it. I just thought it to be a very dumb movie. It's going in my FOR SALE box of DVD's.
B002RV01QI|5.0|One of the songs on this album was used for 3 different videos of SCUBA dives my wife and I made and every time it come on in the playlist, I have to smile because of the memories it brings back.
B005OK722U|4.0|Although I was left puzzled at the end of the movie as to how the main character got out alive is beyond me. But that's the movies. Hostel lll completed my collection of Hostel movies. I've enjoyed them as much as my SAW movies, but SAW is way better.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I was hesitant to watch Merlin. Cannot remember why. After watching from beginning to end, I am obsessed. I bought the show on DVD and iTunes -- and watch it over and over. I love Merthur and am so invested in the story and characters that shine with personality.<br />Colin Morgan and Bradley James are amazing in their roles. I am a fan for life.<br />The rest of the cast were great too, as we're the music, locations & sets, costumes. It's all good. Even the revisioning of the story!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so cool you can build any thing that you can imagine ,that is how awesome this game is.And there are animal chickens,cows,sheep,and pigs.there is lava and water ,every color block and I love it I played it for hours.

B000EWD1KK|1.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  However, this copy is very poor quality, and is even missing scenes from the original movie.  It looks like it was recorded off of a TV.  Do not buy this copy.  It does not do the movie justice.

B005544TRQ|3.0|The cursing.  I flinched every time.  It's funny (as in very peculiar) that captions will write out the names of God that are used as slang/cursing but not other simpler four-letter words like sh__ and so forth.  Not that I like cursing - but w/God's name ... how can I say I love the LORD and listen to stuff like that?  The captions?  They make me wonder.  But that's captions.  But there were other things we liked.  The pace of the show and the interaction between the people. I'm always looking for something to watch, that as a Christian, I can watch and not be offended too far.  I understand it's not a Christian industry for the most part and we do make some exceptions.  Good or bad on our parts?  Well, it went too far ultimately.  I liked that Mike Ross found a new life and something productive, quit being a pothead and continued to try to be honest (despite the lie about his college qualifications).  Even then, he always found a way to say what was true w/o breaching into a lie.  It's &#34;fun&#34; to &#34;love to hate&#34; characters and this show did a great job of making you just not stand this or that person ... wonder about another and so forth. I noticed that the episodes were directed by different people and found it interesting that it stayed in context between directors (for a while at least?).<br /><br />Somewhere towards the second season, perhaps in the second season, the pace stepped up - lines were said faster, things moved to a more dark side and the cursing (which was heavy in some episodes and not present in others) got more intense, as did the lifestyles.  Back into the dark and twisted (perv) side.  A lot of emotion - one side or the other (anger/softer sides etc., were being presented).  Absent the cursing (God's name specifically), it still became too dark and showed the twisted side of at least two character.  So, we quit watching it.  Shame, for we liked certain things about it. And, I do wonder about a few of the characters, but since we were already crossing the line w/the cursing ... we said goodbye to the show.<br /><br />On the very personal note, as a Christian,  I am asking myself how can I manage Philippians 4:8-9 when I cloud my entertainment world with just exactly the opposite. It's just a thought I'm sharing for those who share believing in Christ.<br /><br />Thanks for taking time to read my opinion.ere already crossing the line w/the cursing ... we said goodbye to the show.<br /><br />On the very personal note, as a Christian,  I am asking myself how can I manage Philippians 4:8-9 when I cloud my entertainment world with just exactly the opposite.

B00EY8A6BC|2.0|I'd heard from someone I know that this movie was full of twists and turns and a must see.<br /><br />I was bored.  Until the action started (nearing the middle/end).  And, I figured it out anyway.  It's rare that I don't figure out a show anyway.  I always say that's the &#34;writer in me&#34;.  And, I drive my family nuts b/c I'm always saying this or that will happen.  A lot of times, I am right, but not always.<br /><br />What was boring?  The Vegas show stuff over and again until everything was tied together.  I didn't care for some of the acting, it seemed lack-luster. Like maybe even a few of them didn't like what they were doing?  I wasn't sure if the show was trying to be realistic or fantasy.  It straddled both, and didn't stretch my imagination to accomplish that.<br /><br />But, like I said, someone I know said it kept her guessing all the way through and saying &#34;WHAT!?&#34; at the end.<br /><br />I loved Ruffalo in The Avengers ... he makes a great Hulk.  I liked seeing him in something else - let's me know even more how much I liked him in The Avengers, though I didn't dislike him in this. Maybe it's the genre.  Morgan Freeman - always good (or haven't seen him in a bad role).  However, somewhat predicable was his role.  In so many ways, much was boringly predictable.  One guy talked way too fast.  And, some of it was simply unbelievable (like when the transporter functioned).  The trickery behind it and the explanation about magic not being magic just slight of hand - was good.  The finale?  Unbelievable x 2.  It's like it had 2 endings.<br /><br />But, that's just my opinion.  Maybe, if it had been adjusted here and there, they would have had me more interested.  Wish I had known, I would not have rented it.  :(
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater and on cable.  All of the actors have great chemistry.  I really loved the banter between Bruce Willis, Mary Louise Parker and John Malkovich.  If you like action with the right mix of comedy, this is a movie for you.  I definitely would  recommend it!
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Very emotional song choices. The instruments are great. Still the best of Maroon 5!!! Love them!!! Keep up the good work guys!!!
B001J6IKOC|4.0|It gave me insight into operation Iraque freedom , how the men's every day life was not always that exciting but it was no picnic .
B004HWYTP4|2.0|This is it.<br /><br />one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen<br /><br />Thank you amazon for teaching me how to count up to seventeen.
B0031RS64G|5.0|From recommendation by a friend, I decided to have a look at this book series famous for challenging the reader and steering clear of most of the stereotypical fantasy characters and themes. I was thrilled to find out the fame it had earned was not overrated. One of the things worth mentioning is how Erikson seems to consider how magic, gods and mythical creatures would affect warfare, tactics, strategy and politics if they were real. It reminded me of good scifi writers like Heinlein who always seems to have a good insight on how hypothetical situations would roll out.<br />Word of warning however, the book series is in places very violent and should be avoided if this is a problem to you.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|All of the products,I have purchased so,far,have been great except for the Sony headphones,which broke in about 6 months it was a design flaw.  I also bought a playstaition 3 and was suppose to get a free 30 day subscription to playstaition plus but the code was not in the box and,neither Sony nor Amazon honored it. If it eas not for the other products being good i would have stop doing business with Amazon.
B001EYK52O|5.0|Steve McQueen is a terrific pick for this film. Love the way he handles everything so calmly and leaves the cops empty handed
B003UESJEM|5.0|A great film with great acting that anyone who's ever been laid off from work can relate to - especially in today's job market.
B00006JU7T|5.0|I just love the story line in this movie. It real and down to earth. Al rocked it period !!
B00ESY77LO|2.0|You've read the same from many others but it bears repeating, Luhrman's adaptation has none of the romance or soul of the book.  It is a flashy, noisy, yet terminally dull film.  The acting is wooden, the dialogue stilted.  Good actors are used as mannequins and props so Baz can photograph his lavish sets (even though most everything is done with a very noticeable CGI backdrop).  Everything is so stylized that it doesn't really draw one into the concept of excess and its pitfalls as a theme, it is just simply excess on display.  It all serves to make this interpretation of The Great Gatsby about as poignant and meaningful as a P Diddy video.  Avoid this and buy the novel.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|Great story... I was very glad I finally got to see it! It was rather long to watch but e worth it.
B001PSGF3C|2.0|Wish I had not watched it. The only thing decent in it was Halle Berry and her acting was mediocre.
B009PXNFQE|5.0|I thought couldn't get any better, then I bought the fan edition with 7 more songs and a DVD.  Well worth the purchase.
B0081QZJ6A|3.0|If you're a Neil Young fan and like vintage music, then you'll like this CD collection.  It takes you back in time.  &#34;Silver and Gold&#34; is not in this collection, but should be.  You'll need a player that will decode HDCD to fully appreciate these recordings.  Hands down, my favorite is &#34;Harvest.&#34;  None of these will approach the sound quality of the original vinyl releases.  I haven't heard the similar vinyl reissues, and didn't purchase them because they're very expensive.  Amazon has some great deals if you're willing to wait on a shipment from across the water.
B002OLUPYO|5.0|I purchased this CD after Truth about love.  My whole family loves it!  We listen to it all the time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|From the characters to the music to the sound effects, it is a blast to play! I would reccomend this game to children at heart. Thank you.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Nice easy read.. cute story line. read in one afternoon. It was a little predictable but over all enjoyable book
B00B23O96A|5.0|GREAT SOUND GOOD TUNES ANOTHER SIDE OF THE GREAT GUITARIST A GOOD LIST OF SONGS THAT INFLUENCED HIM FOR YEARS EVEN HAS HIS WIFE AND KIDS SINGING A++
B009AY04A8|4.0|Pretty fun game. Simple format. Kept me interested enough to want to get the sequel and see the storyline played out farther.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this aap. Worthwhile and enjoyable purchase for the Kindle.<br /><br />The puzzles are not overly difficult nor are they too easy - solving each floor is good for 5/10 mins relaxation.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a great book for reference, study, high school and college.<br />If your in college and you don`t already have this then you are out of luck.<br />Of course this book is downloaded on your kindle when you get it, but if for any reason you don't have this book then download it immediately.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game is really cool and amazing and really fun?! I think i will recomemd this game to anyone who doesnt already have it?!
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|For someone who is not really into movies of that era this movie kept my attention completely.  This movie kept my attention from beginning to end and its a movie you will want to see over again & again.  One of the BEST movies I have seen in my lifetime<br /><br />5 STARS 20 times over
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is nice to have easy access to the weather, I am always checking to see what it will be like when I am traveling, and at home.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Since the century started there have not been many great martial arts films. So much so that I have moved away from the genre. The only two films that come to mind as great are [[ASIN:B000N4KENG Jet Li's Fearless]] and [[ASIN:B008Y76VEK Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]. I believe this film surpasses them both, and that is a pretty tall order.<br /><br />Not only has this movie a compelling story and intense dramatic moments, delivered by a cast whose performances shine, but also, the pure martial arts elements are superbly choreographed and feel realistic. The calm demeanor Ip Man possesses throughout most of the movie makes this even better, since it lets the viewer appreciate the beauty of the art.<br /><br />The writers did a great job in taking the real like of Yip Man, Bruce Lee's master, and create a semi-biographical story. The facts and fiction blend well and it is hard to really know where ones end and the others begin without researching the truth. Last but not least, I was mostly impressed by Donnie Yen. He was part of the cast in [[ASIN:B00742BVW8 Hero]], another very good martial arts movie, but his performance was not as memorable as what I saw here. He is in the list of greats now in my book.
6304493681|5.0|This is one of the movies that is synonymous with anime.  So check it out because its one of the best for a reason!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Sheldon is hilarious! Amy is hilarious! Everything about this show is hilarious! I highly recommend this show to anyone in need of a good laugh and wanting to hear some funny media references. You will not regret it!

B009WUAK2M|1.0|I wanted to enjoy this movie because I really love Chuck Norris and I thought Stallone was awesome in Get Carter. Butt............. What a royal waste of time. This movie was absolute garbage. Can I give half a star?
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have always love Mahjong games.  This one was not a huge challenged but it's fun to try to beat your best score.  It's a great way to relax.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|What an action packed story! Loved it! However...<br />Die beginning starts of very slow and I had to keep myself focussed to stay in the story.<br />The rest of the plot is awesome, yet extremely gruesome. None of the characters are safe which promises for edge-of-your-seat reading. After rushing to get to the end I was bitterly disappointed with how it ended. After so much action and twists the end is SUPER boring and watered down. Not even romantic, but rather platonic. Hopefully the movie version will fix it.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Bought this for my roommate, I watched her play all of the games and was quite impressed with journey.<br />Must have for any independent game aficionado or game collector.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Was delivered without any damage. It's Goonies what else is there to say. It Came with a sleeve over the dvd case.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love minecraft, but it is so much MONEY!!!! I'm NOT paying $6.99 for a game. I wish Moiang could lower the price! PLEASE I can't pay that much money. I so so very sorry.

B00E38KGF4|5.0|I like this product. I have it installed on my home computer,  phone,and tablet. It's easy for me to understand.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is great for when you do not have anything else to do. It is very hard to put down. I am loving all the numerous levels.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is the best action game I have ever played on a tablet. I recommended that people play the game. It test your mind and how you look at the playing field.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A total thriller/action novel experience at the edge of your seat- you will not be able to put down for a while.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Not as good s the first one, but damn close. Great effects, performances, just all around a good, fun movie. Makes me excited to see what Abrahms will do with Star Wars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game so addicting on it all day 5 stars would recommend to anyone that's gaming on the phone slot
B002BC9YZC|5.0|Has a nice documentary on the real John Merrick. The picture is crystal clear. Very crisp. More so than I ever remember. The movie itself is a masterpiece. did not realize that David Lynch directed it. The make up for John Hurd is amazing. They were allowed to make molds from casts made from Merrick's body in the 1880's. This should be in everyone's top 10 lists of all time best movies.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn is always on his mark. hard to put down, looking for his next book will it be out this year?
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is great to play. More exciting than other bingo games that I've tried. Many different rooms and options for play.  The technical support/customer service is also very helpful. I recommend this game to everyone.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|how could our financial system get so out of control?  and the companies still paid bonuses.  greed taken over Wall Street
B00CMQX84A|5.0|This is all 3 of my kid's all time favorite movie. It is the one movie all 3 of my kids agree to watch so we watch it a lot. It is also very clean.
B00CCX9DUG|3.0|I really enjoy Philippa Gregory's writing. Her grasp of history intertwined with some fiction is very engaging, however I did find this particular book was a little long winded in some parts I found that I wanted to skip parts of the book particularly when &#34;The boy&#34; had been captured. Was actually glad to finish the book. Usually I'm really sad when I finish a Philippa Gregory book
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This movie compliments the first movie they came out with. My children enjoy it. the monkeys are a little scary.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Great movie. Excellent picture and sound. This was the first time my 16 year daughter has seen it. She loved it
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I would recommend you rent this and if you want to add it to your collection, then buy it. It is a great movie but with most movies like this, after you now the ending, you don't really have a reason to watch it again. It has some good effects but not at the level of an action flick. I'm sure the book was great.
B0092MJ6B6|5.0|This is a classic metal album from the punk-rocker Danzig. Worth the couple of bucks it costs. Almost legendary sing alongs.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Wanted to see it for some time. It took along time to come out on DVD because it was still being seen overseas. It's a great movie and positively one for buying and adding to your collection. It can be watched more than once and still enjoyed. I highly recommend this to action flick junkies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing.  It has most of the things in disposable me 2 .There are so many character, courses and more. Also it's FREE. GO MINIONS.
B004AQR29C|5.0|This movie is great simply due to it being action packed and having an all-star cast. For those hating on the actors being old, that is exactly what makes it worth buying and watching more than once. It is a great movie with some crazy action. The only draw back is that Jet-Li doesn't really show off his skills much in the movie. This is one worth buying and one that you will watch more than once. Expendables II is out now and it is also worth buying rather than renting.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a frustrating page turner. I loved the book and can't wait to start reading the sequel to it!
B003YFIUW8|1.0|I was quite disappointed in this book. Although the story itself was very moving, I found the child narration annoying.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a cool game just need to lower prices on characters and its hard to get to the beach
0062238868|5.0|This is a good book. really amkes the life of these peopple that much more realisticc and unbelievable. good insight.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I love playing these these types of games. Great for playing when you are doing other stuff and the game plays while you are away. My only complaint is there are too many things that need constant attention to get full effects. Overall though, well worth download any playing.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|Love it just as we do all of their other albums! Sat down and listened to the whole thing. thank you
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game I play it all the time!but I wish they would make it like the computer cuz now that would be the best!!!!! Also they should have some like spells and some thing like couches or like lamps or like ROLLERCOSTERS!!!! And that's what I just have to say.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I don't think anyone can go wrong with this Walt Disney FANTASIA dvd!  I bought it for the wonderful music and the expressive colors in the animation:  my granddaughter loves this!  It has such soothing music and is sleep inducing if a person is ready for a &#34;snooze&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome just like subway surfers and temple run. It is narrowly fun game. If u like running games u would like this game.
6305657947|4.0|We were disappointed in the DVD itself.  The movie was good but the DVD stuck in several places toward the end of the movie and completed stopped before the end.  It appeared the the DVD was scratched and when we opened the case the DVD was loose inside it.  Very disappointing!!!
0765325950|5.0|Not my favorite book in the series, but Sanderson really does justice to the Wheel of Time. The entire (massive) novel covers maybe a few hours of time inside the world, all of which is packed with action, intrigue, and some of the most beautiful ends I could have wished these characters could come to. The end of Egwene's story in particular was simply perfect. I cried when Mr. Jordan died, I was terrified when I read a newly published author would be finishing my favorite series, and I've been amazed at the level of skill with which Brandon Sanderson has completed these amazing novels.<br /><br />I, like many of you, would have preferred that the original author finish the series, but I believe Brandon Sanderson was the best choice to take over. His style is certainly different, I would have appreciated more effort to conform to the style and feel of the earlier novels, but I am more than happy with what this, which may be the best story in the fantasy genre, has finally come to.
B005PK553C|5.0|Amazing story portrayed in the first season can't wait to see what's in store for season 2. I understand that season2 is way different than season 1 and has a different location this time around however some of the characters will be There as well as some new faces too.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved Khlaed Hosseini's previous books and really wanted to love this one as well. He is a great writer and this shows in this book as well. Despite the great writing, the story line was quite fragmented and hard to follow at times, and really wasn't as captivating as the previous books. It's hard not to compare to Kite Runner, and A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great series. Like the players and the plots. Can't think of what more to write. Love Alicia. Kids are annoying.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The more you watch the series, the more involved you are in their lives.  Great writing and great acting. Enjoy.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|I am very impressed with this release.  I think any Alice in Chains fan will appreciate and enjoy this album.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My daughter loves my little pony and I loved it as a kid. This game is fun for the both of us!
B00DKY4LBW|4.0|Arctic Monkeys are a great band, I'm not denying that. But After 'Favorite Worst Nightmare' for me they're lacking...something. I can't quite put my finger on it. Ever since Josh Homme got into the studio with them on their third effort the dynamics of who they were and currently are have shifted and for me maybe not in the absolute best way. I have no problem with bands experimenting or maturing so I don't think it's that. 'Humbug' 'Suck it and See' and 'AM' are ALL 4star albums in their own right simply because of the collection of songs themselves.  But it's like from 'Humbug' till now it has become the Alex Turner show. The songs of the last three albums sound like singer/songwriter songs rather than a collective work of a band all getting the chance to work in each members instrumental voice for an ALBUM. Think back to 'Favorite Worst Nightmare' how there was this sense of playfulness and around every corner a surprise of arrangement. Every member got a chance to show what they bring and Turner's vocals melted within everything rather than overpower it. The guy can sing BUT this is supposed to be Article Monkeys not Alex Turner and the Arctic Monkeys. He was always a gifted lyricist but I prefer when the band melds their arrangements together rather than write around what Turner is doing because anymore that's all it sounds like is going on. It's as if someone came in and told them what the dynamics of Arctic Monkeys COULD be even if it wasn't actually who they SHOULD be and they've never looked back since. The best song they've done since FWN is \\"Hellcat Spangled Shalalala\\" on 'Suck it and See' because they let the song simply be what it should be and let it just organically happen. And that is how at least their first 2 albums were where they just ran with ideas rather than try to force them. Within Arctic Monkeys all the members have the instrumental talent. I love when they rock hard and fast but I also love when they work in a beautiful ballad. FWN for meis their best work because it had the perfect balance of both. It was a thought out album that didn't allow it's influences to dictate the direction. 'AM' is very good and though I realize I haven't talked much about it I group it with 'Humbug' and 'Suck It and See' because like those it has the same strengths and weaknesses.The songwriting is still there, the lyrics are are there but I often wondered sometimes when I was listening to it if Arctic Monkeys are even having fun doing what they do anymore because more than any album so far 'AM' sounds like a band simply going through the motions of pretty good songs.There are very many hints of surprises but almost all the songs inevitably go predictable making for an almost sleepy effort. On 'AM' there are influences galore ranging from Black Sabbath to Drake to Elton John so it isn't like they had nothing to work with. But 'AM' Is more like listening to an opening band for Arctic Monkeys where yeah they were good but the motivation of Arctic Monkeys coming out to do what they do kept me watching and listening only they never showed up. Each song on 'AM' pumps around very similar tempos and that's almost criminal not to give such a talented drummer as Matt Helders at least 1song to have some spotlight time. Yes, even conceptually 'AM' has its beautiful moments but as an addition to the Arctic Monkeys catalogue I found myself questioning things a lot like \\"Out of all the songs they could have had on here why Is THIS one album worthy?\\" Even the single \\"Do I Wanna Know?\\" builds and builds but ultimately falls short of anything to take away. In the past albums there were so many songs where after I do my initial listen through I'd go back and listen again and again trying to find and hear that cool guitar in this or that song and the brilliant bass line in another or the manic drum roll on another. I WANTED to go back and listen. On 'AM' as I listened I'd go \\"Yeah this is a good song, nice lyrics, nice guitar, but it justneeds a little more oomph.\\" I mean 'Hellcat Spangled Shalalala\\" is simpler than most of the songs on 'AM' and yet it's stronger than any of them because of its infectious melodic tone and mood. There are cool things on 'AM' but most of it sounds like a band letting their influences lead the way rather than the other way around where they used to hone their influences and combine it with their voice as a collective band. And yet the thing is I give 'AM' 4stars because it is good enough for that but \\"good enough\\" is a far cry from where Arctic Monkeys used to be 'so far beyond my expectations incredible!' Again, 'AM' is really good BUT I'm not sure that it's necessarily worthy of what Arctic Monkeys are capable of in terms of creating an album. It's more like a collection of songs that Turner comprised that still needs the other members instrumental voices on it. It's like a relationship of someone who doesn't want to break up with someone because they don't want to be alone; on 'AM' it sounds like Arctic Monkeys are just making music because they have to. Perhaps they just need to take a break and take some time to simply fall in love with music again because on 'AM' it sounds like they're still in their \\"going through a rut\\" period in their relationship with music.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Wasn't a big McConaughey fan but I liked this movie. Good supporting cast too. Takes a while to get into it, so be patient.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a classic. This is one of my favorites since I was a kid and I still love it.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Liked the main characters. It got a little annoying towards the end, but this part was good. I liked it overall.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|How do I start, oh yeah that's right just start and let the words flow without fear of contempt or judgement.<br /><br />I found this book really uplifting and inspirational, I'm not sure why I didn't give this book a 5 star rating it was precise and to the point and most of all I felt it was honest.<br /><br />It may be due to it being so short but I don't think so maybe I will read it again and revise the review I have given.<br /><br />Having said all that I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who suffers from procrastination or lack of inspiration.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I havent watched the Blue ray version yet but the DVD is looking pretty good. The movie in general is great and easy to follow even for non treky types. I would suggest this to everyone I know.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|An amazing look at Alzheimer's disease from the patient's view. Alice is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers at age 50. This thoughtful book shows how her family responds to her illness and how this Harvard professor tries to cope. Genova also discusses current treatments, and outlooks for the future. Having relatives and friends with this disease, it was a very emotional book for me, but so worthwhile reading.  Don't pass this one up!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|This is a personal favorite from the whole Iron Man trilogy. Needless to say the role Tony Stark was meant for Robert Downey Jr. as he is possibly the only actor on earth with enough charisma and dramatic skill to weave in and out of heartwarming moments and pure comedic joy. This film is considerable more action packed, but the production is all within good reason, this film focuses more on the true character of Tony than any other Marvel film that's been released in the past few years. Although this film like all others has some discrepancies when linking it to the original comics, the artistic decisions cannot be challenged, the movie is simply to well put together to say anything bad about it.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Not so bad. It was scary and I am glad we watched it at home. It was good and was worth watching.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|Please get this cd because all the songs they played are in this movie including the song \\"About Her\\" with the Bessie Smith remix in the background. Like others had posted. Amazon is cheaper than I-tunes.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|He really managed to make me laugh at the dictator. If nothing else he should make some more movies so we can laugh at other issues.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I love this cd so much people ask me stop playing it. All of the songs from the Volume I movie are on this cd. I will order from this company again because there were no problems with delivery and the cd sounds great
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My sister recommended this movie to me, it's really good and worth watching. In the end my husband and I are still debating if it was the animals or the people who got off the ship.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is okay. I was hoping it would be more like the PC or Ipad versions. It does have options for single card, and three at a time etc. I guess I'm spoiled by the others.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Not a bad film, Action was good, but previews of the film showed it to look better than it was
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Clever plot, holds the reader's interest well. A good story line that makes you want to continue with the next chapter, and then the next, ...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Outstanding series! Complex storylines and phenomenal characters make for great tv viewing. Can't recommend this enough. I'd love to meet the cast or even visit the estate
B008XG1X18|2.0|Beyond frustrating!!  Love pinterest, but this App crashes constantly. Can you upgrade for kindle fire? This app needs to mirror the iPhone &amp; iPad apps. Leaves a lot to be desired.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great notes app. All the functions and utilities you could possibly want. Set text lists or check lists. Great alarm and backup functions as well.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This move is really good , its long but not drawn out nor boring , it was one of those shows that make you go hummm
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Characters are so well accentuated, the feeling of that time and the development and the disasterous end could not be described any better! I lerarned a lot about the life of my grandparents (German as I am), I learned more about what happened as it happened than I ever learned in History lessons - and it was enternaining so much more than &#34;real&#34; history books. I very much had the feeling, I lived with the characters in that book, even with the soldiers in the French trenches - every todays teacher or parent should feel obliged to let their children read this book and talk about it afterwards!
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Star Trek Enterprise is the best Star Trek series right after TOS.  It is so intelligently written tying together elements from Star Trek TOS and answering questions that everyone had as to how everything came to be, such as the phasor, shields, photon torpedoes, etc. I watched TOS when it originally aired so as an original Trekie (Don't like the term Treker) and I have watched all of the Star Trek shows to follow, I can with authority say that Star Trek Enterprise was so much better than everything that followed.  I just wish that it had stayed on the air longer.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You will be sitting down for hours playing this game . I have been playing this for days trying to be all of my friends scores im almost there .
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I ordered this season for my daughter who loves this series.  She said that the DVD's are in excellent condition and the product arrived home before the estimated delivery
B000GGSMB2|5.0|Come on now its Al Pacino in Scarface whats there not to like. The world was for Tony Montana's owning but was just to cocky and stoned haha. but I would have loved to been in his shoes threw out the movie movie. Even though its a movie it makes him like an idle to me.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We love the Goof Wife.  It is one of the best TV Shows on TV!  Season 1 is the Best!
1612680011|4.0|Was a different edition than the one I originally read and was a smaller size book which I was dissapointed in but the book its self was unchanged which was really why I ordered it.  Other than that I was satisfied.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Okay. It's great. I am paying for the full version. But I have a request. Please developed a Chinese mandarin version. I live in China so that would be helpful.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|I started reading this series to keep familiar with the type of books my teenager is reading. I couldn't wait to get the second book and I'm going to watch the movie before it finishes at the cinema! Oh, and the teenager might be allowed to come too if not too embarrassed to be seen with their mum!
B0095VP8D4|4.0|I just brought this processor for a gaming PC and it exceeded my expectations. It allows you to run games like chrysis 3, skyrim, battlefield 3 at medium high settings. Not the greatest but pretty good frame rates for the money. At this price there isn't another processor out there that matches it. If you decide to overclock it from 3.8 to 4.2 you can easily get up to 60fps with this processor and 4gb of ram.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This new app for the weather channel is good,<br /><br /> but the old one was better.  I stillhave to travel a lot so I don't mind its.
B00B52F278|2.0|From the very first season I was hooked and couldn't wait for the next episodes to start, although after Andy passed and Liam was cast I just couldn't move on from that completely, Liam has done his best but with such big shoes to fill I don't think he ever really had a good chance to make the show exceptional like it was with Andy. I find my self just watching the final season only becouse I feel invested at this point and obligated to finish the storey.  The language and dialogue in the final season is undeniably terrible, they sound Like a bunch of childlike cave men.  The story at this point is in my opinion is so far off track and confusing that It's hard to even pay much attention to whats happening or being said, this show has had a good run it started out exceptional with the sad death of Andy the actor of Spartacus, to the luke warm ending of the show with the actor Liam playing Spartacus, its time to end this one...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great little device.  Works as advertised and has excellent integration with youtube on the iphone and Chrome on the PC.  Can only hope for more supported apps on iOS.
B001SF8G1Q|4.0|May be the overall best Bob Dylan album I've heard.  As with any album, there are one or two clunkers, but the majority of songs are very good.
0375836675|5.0|This was an incredibly quick read.  The book had the perfect amount of action to keep the story flowing.  It is the story of group of friends who are involved in a hold up, and a turn of events turns this into an unlikely \\"hero\\" story.  The main character is consequently challenged with continuing to be a \\"do-gooder\\" through a series of interactions with strangers.  The book's message is delightfully intertwined within the story, and would be a nice, possibly inspiring, read for teens.
1446303314|5.0|I mainly bought this book for two dolls I wanted to make that were in it. I just wish our children of today loved all the old classics as I do. Another great book for the doll maker
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 10 yr old daughter read this and loved it so much she told me to read it. I did and loved it and have recommended to everyone. Here is my daughter's review: My school made us read a book over the summer and I chose this one. I didn't know if I was going to like it or not but I absolutely loved it!!!! It's one of those books that's super sad but the author writes in just the right way to keep you from crying too much. I most definitely recommend this book to everyone of all ages. A stunning book!!!!!!!😆
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game for anyone. Doesn't require a lot of gaming skills to enjoy---just patience and planning. And decorating ability doesn't hurt
B00C4Y4434|5.0|Her outfit is very cute. Lagoona's hair is very curly and well maintained. Everything just looks great on this version of Lagoona. No dislikes or problems. Anyone who likes Monster High or Lagoona in particular will like this doll.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|gets harder as you go..a lot of ads but its free. good for laying and bed and wasting an entire
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|Unique beauty queen. New look for Lagoona, that is very pretty. Her hair style is interesting as well.  There were no problems and nothing I disliked. Another great addition to anyone's collection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a breathtaking book. I have never read a book so interesting. I have spent two full days reading not being able to take my eyes off the words. I was expecting a very raunchy book when I first started reading the trilogy but I'm hook. If only there was more to the series then three books.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|Very cute version of Howleen.  Liked the whole &#34;look&#34; of this Howleen from her cute boggin cap to her chic boots. Nice idea to keep the hot pink hair and soften and straighten it. So glad they did not put that glue/starch stuff in it.  If you like the Wolf family you will like this one too.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|This game definitely challenges your mind and is a lot of fun to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games and puzzles
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|it was a perfect hidden picture game with just enough challenges to keep me on my toes.  The smaller puzzels in the game were challenging at times.  Had to use the hint button out of impatient frustration.
