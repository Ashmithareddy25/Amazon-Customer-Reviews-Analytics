B00B2166BS|5.0|Easy to use, works great, and feels like a solid build. Also charges quickly and frees up the usb port for other use while charging.
B0000C23DO|5.0|All that I have to say is if you like the Dead, you will like this disc. Gotta love the Dead!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I found Chris's Autobiography so interesting.  What our men and women go thru.  It really deals with two families!!  I highly recommend this book.  It is a great discussion book,
B000E6EHGI|5.0|All that I have to say is if you like the Dead, you will like this disc. Gotta love the Dead!
B000I9WW4U|5.0|I loved this movie when it was first in the theaters and have watched it several times since then.  I like the fact that Amazon made it available at such an amazing price.<br />This is first class acting, good story line and development of the plot and just an enjoyable way to spend a rainy afternoon.
B00007LTIG|5.0|All that I have to say is if you like the Dead, you will like this disc. Every album I have heard of theirs is definitely unique in musical style, especially the first two.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a delightful way to pass time. My 3/4 likes this the most of the many choices she has been playing for the past several months. I use some parts of the game as lessons.  educate,value of money how to bye ,sell, and other values to working.  It maybe ponies but they are trying to reach harmony to life like most people I know...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game rocks I'm can't stop playing it and I like the updates. You need to make more. The Rome update is awesome. I like the egg idea it gives us a chance to get a free hover board
B008J05EL8|5.0|easy to use, COST IS GREAT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I HATE THAT i HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY WORDS FOR THIS TO ACCEPT MY REVIEW
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|The fish are beautifully rendered and, unlike the hassle of a real aquarium, there is no need to clean the tank.  Restful and relaxing.  Now, if I could only remember the feeding schedule . . .
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|GREAT START, BORING MIDDLE, PREDICTABLE ENDING. NOT THE BOND MOVIE THAT I AM USED TO. BUT STILL AN OK MOVIE
1616550414|5.0|Everything I wanted and more. Super fantastic book and highly recommended to anyone who loves the legend of Zelda! I give it my highest possible rating :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is the star-crossed love story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. It makes you laugh a lot, it makes you cry a lot, and you will just wish it never ends. I loved this book. John Green crafted relatable teenage characters who aren't dumb, who aren't super smart brainiacs, but just people. If he writes another book, I will readily purchase it, because this book was just amazing.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|The problem I have with amazon is in their lack of correct description about the product I'm buying.Example this stylus was stated as 6,5in In fact the actual length is 5in. I even called and verified with amazon the length as 6.5in I need reliable info to make an informed decision to buy. I love amazon and will continue to buy but amazon must do better
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app because it helps when I don't know how much battery I have left and I need a specific percent.
B0083GDLL8|5.0|Love the style of Bowie presented on this album. To me Bowie hits and misses with his songs but all of these are hits.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and I love how often it's updated! Always something new! Freezes up sometimes but that may not be just the app. Definitely 5 stars!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVED THESE BOOKS AND RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE THAT LOVES TO READ BUY THEM .l found them to be excellent reading for ages 10 and up even my granddaughter enjoyed then
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a facinating true story and I sincerely enjoyed reading &#34;A Higher Call&#34;. It is very well written and such an interesting WWII story. I have recommended it too several friends. One of the best books I have read.
B005MW8CLK|4.0|I bought it for him for Christmas and he's a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan. It seems to have all that he wants in a collection, from new recordings from the masters, obscure songs and more.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The first season hooked me in for the next season's to come!!! My expectations for this adventure in vampire movies keep the ambers burning for the next season.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This book is very well written and engaging. It provides an amazing depiction of SEAL training and the experience of being deployed in Afghanistan. The tale of Operation Redwings is gripping and utterly amazing. The patriot chest-pounding does chafe a bit (though not as much as in American Sniper, thankfully), and the count of enemies killed by the 4 guys in the story is almost certainly fiction. The verity of the tale has been questioned by experts and witnesses, but the story is nevertheless an amazing one if even half true. There is enough corroboration on the web that I do believe the story, other than the extreme 20 to 1 or more odds against these guys (which by some reports may have been more like 2:1).
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this case/cover for my Kindle. The Kindle locks in a hard underside case and has a soft top attached to it to cover the face so nothing can scratch it. This product met all my expectation. Comfort to hold,folds in the middle to sit in your lap. I do recommend this product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yes this book is as hot as the first. You can\\"t put it down.  What a fantastic imagination Suzanne has.  Now on to book  3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is an amazing game. You challenge yourself to get a higher score than you got from your previous run. Me and my sister play the game almost everyday. She connects with facebook to square off against her friends.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|amazing app I love it. It helps me remember to get my verses done on time. thank u bible app
B000FC0OOU|4.0|This 1939 novel is set during the Spanish Civil War, a war that most American know little about.  The hero of this book is Robert Jordon, an American volunteer hoping that this rebellion would make a better world.  He wants to do good and be a hero but whether or not this happens is basically left for the reader to decide.<br /><br />The book is about his mission to blow up a bridge and the people he meets along the way - Spaniards hoping for a better life and getting caught up in warfare.  Naturally there is a love interest between Robert and Maria, a young woman who had been very mistreated by bad guys and is now seeking refuge with the cave-dwelling freedom fighters of the revolution.<br /><br />The writing is sparse and meaningful.  The setting is depressing.  People struggle.  People die.  The future looks bleak.<br /><br />This is fine story, well told.  However I was annoyed by some of the narrative.  Hemingway doesn't uses curses and so the word \\"obscenity\\" is used where a curse would logically go.  I don't know if this was in only the edition I was reading but I found it very annoying and it broke my concentration.<br /><br />This is the only Hemingway book I have ever read and I did like the writing.  I found the plot easy to follow and I identified with and pitied all the characters.  It is a classic of a time and a place and a writer who will long be remembered.
B0017VV816|5.0|The best movie of all-time on my portable devices is fantastic!!! If you didn't know, your butt better call somebody!!
B004LWZWC4|4.0|Great little movie for those who love Steve Martin, Jack Black or Owen Wilson.  Good story line for a night at home with your significant other.  Doesn't require emotional commitment and is an easy going and laughable movie.  Recommend it when you are looking for a good time.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Very captivating throughout.<br />Started in October on a borrowed kindle but had to give back unfinished so was given oneforChristmas andjustfiniished.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|As always, A.Munro grabs me immediately into her story.  But I am noticing a &#34;pattern&#34; - so far all her principal male characters hold similar character traits, unbearably controlling, Another &#34;but&#34; - that is the thematic string for these stories; and perhaps &#34;that's life&#34;?
B009VB97EY|4.0|One of my straight FB friends described MM as a bro flick disguised as a chick flick. Whatever...it's pretty good either way
B00007KQA3|4.0|While the storyline was not followed with obsessive compliance the digressions were few and in the context of the intent and feeling of Orwell's story were impactfully presented.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This is NOT a children's film. It is, however, very funny. Once you get past the idea of a talking teddy bear, you'll see that it touches on themes like man-boys who never grow up, child celebrities that the public won't allow to grow up, life-long friendship and how they evolve, etc.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This story describes the heart gripping journey of one man and it becomes a heart gripping journey for the reader.  I considered myself fairly well informed about the brutality of life in North Korea but discovered how little I actually did know.  How this man survived a life-time of physical torture, starvation, and mental terror is almost incomprehensible but now the assault continues against his spirit.  This book addresses significant topics of historical, social and psychological importance as well as health, poverty, power and lack of justice of an entire nation.  This story gives insight to what happens to someone who grows up in a complete void of love and compassion we normally get from a family.  My heart goes out to him with prayers for him to grow in grace, love and acceptance of himself.  He deserves and needs all that will allow his spirit to thrive.
B005PK56TA|5.0|its a great show. It follows a family's move from Boston to LA in order to start fresh. But the series really starts in the middle of the story and lets the viewer piece it together for themselves; like all good mystery-dramas should. As I said, it's not for children; there are sprinklings of adultery, S&M, violent murder, and even a little something for you true-crime buffs.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Fast moving storyline that kept the kids interested.....read this with my 10 year old and we both couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.  There were intense scenes that we were actually surprised to be included in a book meant for a younger audience, but that kept us wanting more.  We plan on purchasing the next book in the series as well!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The first time I tried watching this series, I found it VERY confusing; lots of characters and very few background clues. But so many of my friends just raved about it, so I tried watching it again while I was home sick. WOW - you gotta stick with it thru about 3 episodes, but it's well worth it. very intricate story lines and a very rich and colorful narrative, but you have to pay attention. In fact I am rewatching the previous seasons and picking up on things that I missed the first time around. Oh, and it's definately NOT FOR KIDS; lots of nudity and bad language.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well I love this game but sometimes it messes me up and I have to restart again but otherwise it is a good game and everyone should love it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season two picks up during WWI many of the men fight, some don't. Downtown becomes a hospital/convalescent home for the injured. It's a great series not just because the acting and the dialogue are good, but the production details are all there.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|The controls are a little hard to get used to. The graphics are simple, yet interesting. All in all, a good game.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Absolutely loved the book, reminded me a lot of one of my favourite shows Lost.  Can't wait to start the second book.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I really enjoyed this game but most of the levels were very simple although there were some hard ones that took several tries to complete. All in all, I'm glad I have it on my Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|So fun and so addicting. But I wish more free stuff would be cool. But over all this game is the best  game ever
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I like this game but sometimes the gravity issues had me wanting to throw my device across the room! I still haven't gotten all the way through it.
B00A77II0U|1.0|I have had no problems downloading, playing the games you have ..would suggest twisted land. But I've been trying to download this game for 3 days it will not download I paid 2.99 I would highly appreciate if I could actually play what I payed for.. until it's fixed I have no suggestion for anyone to buy this game it doesn't download.. if they fix the problem I change my review..
B0000894RZ|5.0|I first heard Lisa Stansfield music while stationed in Germany. I was like, \\"Who is this chick with this soulful voice.\\" I think her music is so relaxing. And I love all her songs especially \\"All Woman.\\" I think this was a good buy.
B008JOLG7U|5.0|A Big Fan of Jennifer Lopez & her Music, Thank You for the great sale.<br />That's the reason why I scored her like that.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo has some of the best writing I've heard in a film in a long time. Action packed, and very suspenseful.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|While a bit too violent at times, it serves as an example of easily a good guy can go down the wrong path.  Poor health and the need to take care of one's family in  a time of extreme costs to do both thrust Walt into a character on the verge of revenge on it all.
B008I6ZX1E|3.0|The books are ok, but the hardcovers are some kind of cheap cardboard and not really the quality you want in your bookshelf. If I knew, I would have either bought from another publisher and got quality hardcovers, or saved my money and bought paperbacks. These cover somewhere in the middle ground and are useless for that reason.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I think there was to much credit given to the US when the Canadians did most of it.I didn't like the the fact that it showed Carter in a positive way.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Richard Gere of course is amazing as always.  Great debut for Edward Norton.  I had seen this movie a long time ago, but wanted to review it since it had been mentioned in an article regarding the scandals in the catholic church.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Mr. Craig, arguably the best Bond since Connery, makes this way above average film a triumph!!  Well worth the cost.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Should have just stopped.  Why did they have to make this one?  Should have at least had a Matt Damon cameo in there somewhere.  I'm a bourne fan and this just wasn't it!!
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Mr. Craig, arguably the best Bond since Connery, makes this way above average film a triumph!!  Well worth the cost.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|Movie was Ok.  Seemed to be by much like all the other movies out there these days.  Seemed to drag.  Love Bruce Willis and Sigourney weaver.  Not the best performances.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Once again the BBC proves that even when their product does NOT live up to expectations, it is still wonderful and wildly entertaining.  Weaker than the first two seasons but nonetheless a winner.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Very disappointed.  Cast like that and I thought it was a flop.  It had good intentions but it just lacked.  Very disappointed.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie is so beautiful with the way the story is told from this vulnerable boy's point of view. All of us &#34;misfit toys&#34; can appreciate a movie about not being popular in high school, and how hard it is to make friends when you're different. Loved it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Very good and an exciting end to the trilogy. Again, I felt the overabundance of sexual encounters actually detracted from the overall enjoyment of an otherwise awesome story.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Very snappy and upbeat compared to the Resistance. Muse moves back to their more pop like roots with 2nd Law. Still biting and somewhat political just like any true fan has come to enjoy.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The storyline and intrigue were some of the best. Couldn't put my Kindle down until I was falling asleep. I felt the overabundance of gratuituous sex was completely unnecessary, it actually detracted from my enjoyment of the novel. I jumped past those parts and felt that I still had a fantastic read.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Very easy to use on my Android device and I love that I don't even have to copy the data to my local device. I can play the music anywhere I have an internet connection.
B00130VLZ4|3.0|This &#34;semi-hard&#34; case should be described as semi-soft. Every piece of this case is flexible, not providing very good protection. It will prevent scratches and minor bumps and bangs, but I would not trust this to protect in a fall or drop.<br /><br />I purchased this case for one purpose though. On a trip or vacation, I don't want to lug around a bag full of extra lenses, spare batteries, straps, etc. I use one multipurpose lens and want basic protection when carrying the camera. In that regards, it does fine.<br /><br />My other gripe would be the same complaint others have had. The case must be used with the original(or similar) strap. I have an R-type strap that screws into the bottom of the camera that I cannot use, unless I &#34;fix&#34; the case.<br /><br />This case can be useful, but I would recommend testing a friends or trying one out first.
B0076DEJMO|3.0|Overall, I didn't think this book quite lived up to the others.  Was nice to see the return of some characters, but others were really under-utilized (don't want to give away any spoilers).  However, if you're a fan of the others, you'll like this one as well.
B00A4OALL0|5.0|Wayne Shorter ab outstanding album!! One of he master's of jazz the music is intense and complicated. The live album is outstanding.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Julian Fellows continues to keep us wanting to know more about the lives upstairs and downstairs. The actors are fabulous.
B009DT424Y|5.0|I use this to assist my disabled son who talks low. This pairs to most bluetooth speakers. I use it with a HMDX Audio HX-P230RD. Pairs consistently. Only negative is the mic is on the same end as the micro usb port. Would be better on the opposite end, but works great. Its great that no computer or any thing else is needed to make a simple voice amplifier with this device. I have searched a lot for any other wireless mic that can do this in case there would be something better but I cannot find anything that even will pair with a dumb speaker, they will all sync with a smart device, but this does both.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|My family and I love this movie. It takes me back to when I was a kid; a great movie for children and adults. Instant classic in my book.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|what could be better than swords dragons and beautiful naked women and the acting is wonderful i have been watching from the beginning.
0307887448|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  A lot of 80's pop culture mixed in with a future post apocalyptic society that prefers spending most of their time in a virtual universe called OASIS.  Wade Watts (avatar Parzival) is the first person narrator, living in the stacks which are located on the outskirts of every large city.  The energy crisis has made it almost unlivable in the rural landscapes so anyone not wealthy enough to live in the city are stuck on the outskirts in modules that almost seem like ship containers.  The dead eccentric founder of Oasis, James Halliday (like a Willie Wonka), has left instructions to hand over OASIS and $ 150 Billion to the winner of a contest to find an Easter Egg he has left within the Oasis Universe.  Wade and a like minded group of real world misfits take on the challenge battling each other and an evil corporate entity, IOI, that wants to take over Oasis and monetize it.  Wade and his group are against this so they battle it out.  The key to finding the egg is to master all knowledge about Halliday and his love/obsession with the 1980s when he was a teenager.<br /><br />The story reads very fast and is a lot of fun.  The future is disturbing but considering where we are today I can't say it's too far off base.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I want to rate it 5 stars because it was a really funny book and I will read all old the series of these books
B000NTPDSW|5.0|THE GODFATHER COLLECTION (The Coppola Restoration) in Blu Ray is the Cinema Bible. A must have movie for all the cinema lovers.<br />This set is perfect in the image and sound quality, and it have a great bonus disc with real good materials.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thought these would be books for women but they are not. Try one guys you'll like it read the first one and had to have the other 2 .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have played this game for my first time and I wanted to marry the person who showed this game to me.I recommend this game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The page size could not be better.  I like the large scale and easy function of the calculator.  Wish more apts were this size.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was amazing!  It gave a great insight into the life of an American hero that I think everyone should read to truly understand what our men and women of the armed forces do and have done for this country.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|An easy game to pass away the time while riding in a car, bus, or train.  Nothing difficult about this apt.  Good one for kids of all ages.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good love story. It makes you think of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Good for adults who know fact from fiction.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I really enjoy all the different time period of your books, but no the language or sexual encounters.  It would be just as great without it in there!
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Usually not a fan of live recordings, but this is superb. Frank and Basie are at their best. I could listen to this over and over again.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Got this for my 7 year old daughter and now i can't keep everyone else from playing with it. There are many interesting designs. We make it a game. Causes many laughs!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game I have always wanted a house and this is helpping me out so much.. It didn't cost me anything and for anybody thinking about getting it.. GET IT NO QUESTIONS ASKED!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book is just plain fun to read.  The plot is unique and the characters are interesting.  I particularly like the insightful voice of the narrator.  This is a must read.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Although a lot of the story was predictable, it was still a good read. It was both heart wrenching and heartwarming.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|challenging and fun game... work to get 3 stars on all levels... harder than it seems... enjoyable and passes time
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I won't be a spoiler, but I was disappointed with the season finale.  The rest of the series was great and I love Series 1 and 2. Can't wait for Season 4.
1594135312|3.0|This book wasn't specific enough on the topic and was a little long in providing non-specific information surrounding the interactions between the characters.  Although the stories were colorful, the actual content of the book lacked specificity.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Was an amazing story and though the gore almost made me gag, i couldn't get my eyes to turn away. Amazing story that brings the standards of fiction to a whole new meaning
B008M721MS|1.0|horrible... it crashes too much and crashes during calls. then sometimes never loads messages when I'm on pc skype. it bugs me so much and it takes a long time to load messages. i say this app is not recommended.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Love the show and the music is better.  I sure hope there is a second season CD coming out soon
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Very exciting! These books just make you wanna keep on going! Can't wait to read the next one! Love it!
B0098VXDDS|3.0|They talk too much in this season. The same reason people don't like to read Shakespeare is the reason people won't like this season. Too much character development, too much whining, too much drama. More swordplay, less wordplay.
0307455874|5.0|I had heard and read so many things about 'Obama said this' and 'Obama said that' so I bought the book so I could read it and find out for myself just what was the truth.
B002NNA9N0|3.0|The acting was brilliant. The basic premise is boring. A bunch of real estate salesmen display greed, avarice, and money hunger. The salesman's personality is on display, and the display is ugly. That wouldn't be so bad, but the predictability of the plot is tedious.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|This program over the course of 8 seasons consistently leaves you on the edge of your seat with suspense. The writing and directing are absolutely amazing, with an abundance of interconnecting plot lines creating multiple levels of conflict and companionship between the characters. In my opinion one of the best long form series in the history of television
B00116GHMM|5.0|This album, on vinyl is really so much better then in MP3 or CD format. Since the music has the almost 70's disco feel, a record player adds that extra ambiance making it just that much cooler.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Couldn't stop watching, stayed up until all hours of the night. Can't wait for the next season to come out!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I heard from others about this great show, and believe me when I say it did not disappoint -  I am definitely hooked.  The characters are all well developed and the actors do an amazing job in their roles.  After watching the first episode I immediately went on to watch 2nd, 3rd, and so on, and I continue to be involved with this amazing show.
0345803485|1.0|I found this book in a suitcase my mother had filled up with books she wanted to donate, so I figured, WTH, let's see what the hype is all about.<br /><br />Let me just start by saying that although I didn't spend any money on it, the hours I wasted reading it are gone forever and should've been spent doing something else. ANYTHING else. THAT, I regret deeply.<br /><br />I had no idea that this piece of c#$% was Twilight fan fiction, but then it makes sense because the whole thing, the characters, the plot, even the location, are all Twilight-based: Anastasia is basically Bella, only this time around she gets laid every 20 pages or so. Christian has Edward's copper tousled hair. They all live in Washington state.<br /><br />I don't even know where to start so I guess I'll just make a bullet list:<br /><br />-The bad writing. I mean , the worst writing I've ever had to endure. I keep wondering how Ms. James managed to pull this off. Are there no editors at her publishing house? Holy c$%&. holy s*¨#$, holy f$%&, later's babe and all sorts of similar expressions are on every single page. 'Later's, babe'?. Who talks like that?<br /><br />-I never thought I'd say this, but Anastasia is worse than Bella. She keeps asking herself why this guy wants her when she is nothing. Well, if you have to ask yourself that, then you probably aren't worth it. Did I mention she's a 21-year old virgin who has never masturbated, calls her vagina 'down there', has an annoying 'inner goddess' and although Christian has told her that he's into inflicting pain, she manages to act surprised at the end because she felt pain? Ugh. Oh, and she supposedly never owned an email account or a computer before Christian came around. What century has this girl been living in? AND, she is willing to put up with anything this psycho does because he is just so gorgeous, something that is said over and over ad nauseam.<br /><br />-Christian has a little more depth, although psychologically he makes no sense. He's supposed to be a 27-year old billionaire, which means that he is probably a tough guy, and yet he is whiny, insecure, jealous and a stalker. Someone that insecure could never make it big in business. I mean, the whole buying out the plane seat next to her, following her to Georgia, giving her a Blackberry and a computer so he can monitor her every move, that's just sick and I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with him being a dom and her a sub.<br /><br />-The constant and ridiculous emails they sent to each other. Anastasia's written and oral (and by oral I mean her speaking skills, not the oral skills Christian deeply appreciates, seeing that she has no gag reflex. Ugh) skills range from Snooki to Elizabeth Bennet in the same sentence. Who uses 'avuncular'; in the middle of a conversation?<br /><br />-The BDSM. I'm not that knowledgeable on this subject but I've been told (more than once, actually) that this is a sexual preference and as such rarely reflects on people's real lives, meaning that a sub in the bedroom is rarely a doormat in real life, and a dom is not necessarily a control freak either. So there goes the author's research.<br /><br />-These people have sex all around the place and every few pages. THIS is supposed to be the good part of the book and what has been turning women on all around the world. Let me just say that by the middle of the book I'd had enough already it was so repetitive and monotonous that I started skipping to the 'substance'; to see if the plot got any better. It didn't. I can't believe Kathy Lee and whatshername and the anchors of the Today Show actually raved about this book, saying it was a great Mother's day gift.  Heck, even Dr. Oz had a show about how this book improved couples' sex lives. Puh-leez.<br /><br />-This stupid girl tries throughout the entire book to get to the core of his issues so she can \\"fix\\" him. In the process, we learn that he was abused into BDSM by an older woman when he was 15. And somehow,you never read or hear anyone criticizing this way-too-casual reference to pedophilia. Disgusting.<br /><br />-Anastasia and Christian are in an extremely abusive relationship. Stalking and wanting full control over someone is not love. Just because people prefer calling it something else or fool themselves into thinking it's romantic doesn't mean it isn't abuse.<br /><br />The fact that such rubbish made it to the NYT top 10 says a lot about us as a society. I mean, people can write whatever they want and hope it'll go viral. The problem is, there must be way too many lonely, hopelessly romantic women out there to let this disaster become some sort of reading reference. Every single woman I know has read this book and loved it, and every time I've had something to say against it they consistently refute it, as if I hadn't understood the darn thing, when I think I got it a lot better than all of them did. For someone who reads as much as I do, I'm pretty certain my reading comprehension level exceeds that of all of them, who have probably only read this one book this year because this sorry excuse for writing was published.<br /><br />It's a sad day when you realize that issues such as abuse and pedophilia are being ignored for the sake of romance. I truly never thought that one stupid book could do such damage. And I don't think I'm being dramatic here. When people start ignoring important things because they'd rather look the other way, they are accepting them by default. And shame on Ms. James. Instead of writing about a strong, independent heroine other women could look up to, she's debased us all by serving up a spineless, immature weakling that can't stand up for herself and puts up with unimaginable situations for the sake of a guy, who in turn, doesn't even love her.<br /><br />Writers who get lucky enough to be published have the incredible power of reaching other people's minds and speaking to them through their characters. I believe they should take thatresponsibility and privilege more seriously and try to contribute instead of punching us in the face with their own sexual fantasies.<br /><br />I wonder if Ms. James has daughters, and if she does, I seriously hope they are as disgusted with her as I am.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this Kindle book after the Secret Garden. Next &#34;Sketches&#34; and just finished &#34;An Old Fashioned Girl&#34; at about 3 a.m. today 28 Feb. I have always had a hard time putting down a good book. I find the Kindle is good if you want to focus on just one book at a time. I appreciate the bookmark feature which helps me to return where I left off. Thank you Amazon.
B006LS7DQE|2.0|Maybe I am just to old for some of these games. I mostly download games that are challenging or they can be played with the grand children. This was neither.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I heard one of the songs from this CD recently on one of the NCIS or other similar type show. I love, love, love Josh Groban and so I knew I had to have it. I am not disappointed one iota. I have listened to it twice, already. It arrived on time and well packaged. Thank you Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Yes, there are only 10 games unlocked to start, but I've unlocked 24 without too much trouble. There are free offers if you want extra points.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This was not one of Colin Farrell's best efforts.  Not a lot going on, very predictable.  Cinematography not very good.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Great item. Shipped rapidly and arrive in excellent condition. The was a very well written: suspenseful with interesting characters.. Why do I have to write 20 or more words? The stars are enough.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I really enjoyed Jeremy Renner's performance, understated but powerful.  Action packed from beginning to end.  Can't wait for the next one.
0375703861|5.0|Great item. Shipped rapidly and arrive in excellent condition. I trust that my friend will find this one of the best novels ever written, full of Shakespeare's blend of comedy with tragedy or at least serious themes. Why do I have to write 20 or more words? The stars are enough.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Another big hit in the James Bond series.  Daniel Craig is very exciting as Bond.  Very good story paced with action.

B007RI56NY|3.0|While this collection has the hits &#34;Drive By&#34; and &#34;50 Ways to Say Goodbye&#34; on it and they're both excellent songs, as a whole Train's previous release had more hooky tunes.
B009EAALEW|4.0|Another great live performance from the master himself. The only complaint could be that there was just not enough material included. I have tickets to his shows here in a few weeks and this is what I expect to see, just heaps more.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Joss Whedon's \\"Serenity\\" is a worthy followup to the much-loved, short-lived series \\"Firefly,\\" as well as a valentine to the thousands of fans who refused to let the show die after the Fox Network canceled it in 2002. It is less a sequel than a continuation of the series, picking up the action several months after the events of the last episode. The crew of the Serenity finds itself in greater peril than ever, as an Alliance assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his storm troopers target River Tam (Summer Glau) for death.<br /><br />The main value of \\"Serenity\\" to fans--besides reuniting the cast and allowing a bigger budget for special effects--is in providing further crucial details about the story of River, what happened to her in Alliance custody, and why the Alliance wants her dead. Reviewers have reasonably debated whether \\"Serenity\\" works as a stand-alone movie; I don't think it does. You really need to know who these characters are, how they relate to each other, and the society in which they live to truly appreciate \\"Serenity,\\" which means you should probably have seen at least a few episodes of \\"Firefly\\" before you watch the movie.<br /><br />Whedon's writing is as sharp as ever, as are the performances of the ensemble cast. Whedon never shied away from sorrow and tragedy in \\"Firefly,\\" but \\"Serenity\\" frees him from the narritive necessities of a weekly series, allowing him (without giving away any plot points) to bring the tragedy closer to home. Personally, I wish he hadn't done that, though I salute his courage.<br /><br />The DVD includes a generous selection of deleted scenes and outtakes in the Bonus section, as well as Whedon's self-deprecating introduction to the movie and scenes from the appearance of Whedon and the \\"Serenity\\" cast at a ComicCon convention. It is touching and heartening to see them engulfed by the love of their fans. They deserve it, every one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game, but very easy to loose track of time. highly recommend if you are looking to pass the time.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|Who would've guessed that crooked cops could be so easy to sympathize with? This series is as awesome as they come. There's never a dull moment from scene to scene. Vic Mackey is Tony Soprano with a badge! I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys unconventional police dramas.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Celine at her best. My neice and her new baby have been enjoying it together and I also enjoy my own copy.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Well written, deeply woven story of life, death, love, money, power, betrayals, and pain.  So often, books are shallow and written on an assembly line.  This series is deeply written with truth, imagination, fantasy, and intelligence.  I believe the author lived this story and in this world as he wrote the book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Amazon is hitting stride with &#34;Amazon Basics&#34;... I've purchased a couple cables and this bag so far.  You can't beat the price of products in the basics line.  This bag is just what I needed for my DSLR and few accessories I have.  No complaints whatsoever.

B004FHCH96|5.0|Don't have the time to do a proper review, but I do want to say this film is more than worth watching.
B002X3V4P2|3.0|It's pretty christmas music if that what it is, I have heard music similar to some of these on this album, I gave it a 3 star because the music is to sad for me, mainly her voice, but if you like to day dream a lot, this would be a good album for you.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I read this many years ago. It is a book to be read over and over.<br />I have just finished Jane Eyre also.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|With an additional story line, the plot get better and the suspense get higher. The characters develop in interesting ways.
B000J5XS3C|3.0|I bought mine used.  When I got it in, it didn't work.  There was either something wrong with the power cable or the power input in the board.  Behringer uses a custom power supply, so I had no way of testing it.  I had to send it back for a refund.  I read other reviews that have had the same problem, so it seems to be an occasional issue.<br /><br />However, I've used one of these boards before.  The one I used back then was fantastic and everything I needed for small projects.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a great wind down game after a long day. Super creative and neat graphics. I did not run into any bugs or glitches.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game did not work properly and after several atempts it just completely stoped working. It is just taking up space in my Kindle.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The Phoenix Project is one of the best books regarding common IT pitfalls and the ways to correct them and build a better, repeatable process to make sure the both IT and the Business win consistently.<br />The Phoenix project is another great book by Author and former CIO Gene Kim and the perfect complement to &#34;The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps.&#34;
B0098VXE50|5.0|This film really made me remember the original ancient tale as opposed to the Disney happy-happy bastardized version. Yes, the actress Kristen Who-wart in it is awful, whining, and unconvincing, but I just ignore her like I did while my wife dragged me to see the Twilight: A New Yawn series. The dwarves are AWESOME, the scenery/cinematics are great, and Theron made an amazing witch queen (which just made Stewart's acting seem even worse).
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|we remember playing Oregon trail frowning up and still love it today. and iv suggested this game to friends,.yes.... awesome game. get it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The original Temple Run was a big hit, thanks to its tight play mechanics and that &quot;gotta run one more time&quot; quality that kept players coming back. This sequel takes everything that worked in the previous game and builds on it, resulting in a truly excellent game that makes a serious case for the viability the mobile platform.<br /><br />The core gameplay is the same deal as before: run along a narrow path, grabbing gold and dodging obstacles while occasionally making turns. However, that narrow path now twists and turns and features a great deal more scenery (plus a neat new rappelling setpiece that lets you cross large gaps), making much better use of the graphical power of today's tablets and smartphones.<br /><br />Just like the first game, this one is free, and it doesn't have a terribly large file size either. So go ahead and get it. You'll be hooked.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love that he doesn't only sing about \\"partying and women\\" like other rappers do. His songs not only have a great meaning but a catchy beat as well. I don't usually write reviews but Macklemore and Ryan Lewis deserved one :)
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I recommend this book to teens and adults. I had to read it for my college English class and write a paper on it. This book allows the reader to see life through they eyes of an autistic individual. It gave me a whole new perspective on life! Enjoy the book. It is so amazing I read it in 4 days which is good for me because I hate reading!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I bought after seeing this book recommended in Dr OZ.<br />I have been following the diet designed for fast weight lost and lost 13 pounds in 3 weeks. Easy to recommend then!<br />But it´s not just the diet, I found the whole book interesting.<br />This book is for those who are ready to make a change in their lives to feel better and have found, like myself, that other methods normally fail.<br />It is full with very clear tips and instructions as to make it easy to follow<br />Love it
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Poor quality, poor directing, poor script, poor acting, poor, poor, poor.  It wasn't worth watching, nor the money. Nor the time.
B000059XUP|5.0|I'm a long-time fan of this film but I won't go off and say that I don't understand why people trash it. Like any film, The Crow: City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them.<br /><br /> First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer: They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow: City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying.<br /><br /> Ashe resurrects and seeks out his vengeance with the help of Sarah who is having psychic dreams about Ashe and his murder. Sarah (Mia Kirshner) may not seem interesting to some but she is completely enamored with Ashe. The taboo of the living making love to the dead was cut out of the film (amongst many other things) and never pursued in the \\"director's cut\\" or the cut you'll see on Netflix. I wish the studio didn't cut that out of the film. Still, you get the feeling that these two are passionate about each other.<br /><br /> The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected.<br /><br /> I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut ofthe film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them.<br /><br /> What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing. It just sucks that no matter which version you see you're seeing a murdered film. So much was cut out of it that made important elements make sense. The director, Tim Pope, who was most known for directing music videos was not allowed by the studio to realize his vision of this film full form. The \\"director's cut\\" is not the actual director's cut (from what I've read) but that's the cut I suggest you see if you're ever going to take the chance. You will not find that cut on Netflix which is the severely butchered version of an already butchered film.<br /><br /> My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion. Like I said, The Crow City of Angels wasn't for everyone. Take it or leave it as you please but I'm not afraid to say this has always been one of my favorite films.the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall.

0307720748|5.0|Sir Richard Branson might be one of the most influential men alive. Branson digs far down and details his humble beginnings to get where he is today, including his ballooning adventures (the part I found uninteresting, oddly enough) to his dilemma of having to sell Virgin Records to keep the entire Virgin enterprise afloat. The end of the book is slightly bleak with his view of the world in it's rough shape but he sees optimism, if we all work together.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great reading completed the book in two day it was  hard to put down recommend it to  anyone who like Grisham
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was the worst book i have read out of the 85 i read last year.Boreing-slow-never came alive.It was a chore to complete, constantly hoping for a change in pace.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this series. Many laughs and many happy moments with the gifted actors.  Bravo
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excelent reading, good store well told, a little slice of life not so glamorous.Had trouble putting it down.Was capitivated.A must read.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Within three days of seeing this film for the first time, I watched it twice more.  It captivated me that much.  The subject matter is heavy but the story is not a parable; it does a fantastic job of not dictating a lesson learned or creating archtypes of heroes and villains.  The story is presented nonlinearly but not in a gimmicky way, focusing on five phases of the protagonist, Eva's (Tilda Swinton) life.  It abandons the typical escalating-events-that-crescendo-into-a-specific-climax type storytelling; one that traditionally would spoil the movie after the first viewing or reading about the ending.  The quality of this movie doesn't rely on the nature of its subject matter.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|A fascinating oportunity for somebody that had this experience to write  an atractive account of this mission. Unfortunately  Mark Owen falls short of this goal.

B008HK3S04|4.0|I bought this case for my 11 year old granddaughter, for her birthday in January. She liked it just fine, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I thought it would be a bit thicker with padding, but it's fine. Love the colors.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book starts with a crime which is believed to have been committed by a prosecutor's child.  The upscale municipality is in an uproar over the crime and the family.  To say more would be unfair to future readers.  I am a lawyer, so this book was especially interesting to me.  I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense, intrigue, politics, law, psychological science & a very suprising but fitting ending.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Great story- especially since I was a little deficient in my WWI history- the characters are as likeable or despicable as they ought to be. Great insight to the behind the scenes of WWI, and the personal aspects it affected.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a while. Even tho the ending was sad it was very good. Worthy of being a prequel to The Maze Runner.
B004S9AK3G|4.0|Perhaps not entirely fair, but while I did enjoy the strengths of the characters, and despite the story taking place 200 years after the Pillars epic, this story line seemed very similar in many ways. I still enjoyed it.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I never thought I'd buy the Godfather trilogy in blu-ray but when Amazon put it on sale I could not resist. Godfather 1 and 2 are iconic films that do not lose any of their appeal with time. The color and sharpness of these films almost tempts me to watch Godfather 3 but I have not succumbed to that yet. Now if they could only put Godfather 1 and 2 in chronological order in blu-ray that's another set I would purchase.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book is well written and keeps your interest level up. It gives a very good account of how one Navy Seal reached his goal in life and the way it affected his loved ones. Unfortunately, I became interested in this book after Chris Kyle's tragic death.

It will be good $ saving if you buy from Amzon in retail pack rather then Apple Store<br />I have another adapter from different Vendor however I prefer to use this most of the time.<br />Connection to macBook thunderbolt is smooth and you find it firm when you apply other side VGA cable<br />I will suggest to apply VGA cable first to adapter and then go for laptop Mini Display port.

B003UBTX6S|2.0|I really felt like this book became really whiny. The writing itself was just fine. The content though, was just irritating. I wanted to just shake the characters and yell at them to snap out of it and DO something! I don't think I'll be continuing on in the series. I just couldn't develop any attachment to the characters, except maybe Link who seemed only to be there for comic relief.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I loved this movie... It's action packed and the actor who plays \\"THOR\\" in this movie fits him to a T!<br />Great casting! can't wait til the next one comes out!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love this movie! Came with all the versions and excited to be able to watch it. Definitely would recommend this to others, no complaints from me.
B009X01ELC|5.0|I purchased this product based on the reviews I read for it. And I must say I'm not disappointed. This case fits my kindle fire like a glove. It's lightweight and convenient. I love the leather case. In so many words, I would definitely recommend this product.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and was super excited when I found it for such a great price. It is worth the buy!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I've never been one to like zombie shows and creepy movies.  Hubby got me watching this show and after I watched the first season I had to buy the 2nd!  I only have the last episode of the 2nd season and I don't want to watch it yet because I can't buy the 3rd season yet and I don't want to have to wait to see more episodes I haven't seen yet!  LOL!  I think I'm an official addict.<br />The show isn't just blood and guts, there's basic humanity and real, emotional people and these make the show worth watching even for those of us not into creepy blood and guts kinds of things.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Es una pelicula para reflexionar sobre la vida, lo que hacemos con ella y el proceso normal de la muerte. Esta pelicula refleja nuestra realidad actual, mediante cirugias, productos quimicos, dietas milagrosas, etc pretendemos evadir el ciclo de la muerte. Mas que una pelicula comica es una oportunidad para reflexionar...
B002X3V4P2|5.0|As other early reviewers have already provided detailed breakdown of her songs, I just wanted to add that if you have not purchased this song collections yet, now is the time (very low price). I just finished listening after download and suffice to say I am very pleased with my latest purchase.<br /><br />If you are Enya fan, you cannot go wrong unless you already purchased other CDs or MP3s with the song that is already included here.<br /><br />For others who are not familiar with Enya, listening to the sample music will give you an idea if her style of music is agreeable to you or not.  If you are Lord of Ring fans then I think you'll go for it. :D
B000NY12LO|3.0|It was a good book not my favorite but I would recommend someone to read it if they wanted a book to read
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I am a longtime Steven Wilson fan, through his  solo material,but also with Porcupine Tree, blackfield, he has assembled a very tight band, great musicians, well filmed
B0024Y9EYS|1.0|How could anyone stand to watch the terminator chase Sarah Conner and her son week after week?  I surely couldn't stand to.
B002N1AEN2|3.0|music too slow and moody for me, a little depressing actually. Female vocalist good, but too plodding to grt into
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Basically that is what Fringe is, a retelling of the x-Files, up dated of course and with a little different slant but basically the same.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|have listened to this album at least 50 times, very diverse sounds,listening is easy. The vocals are high pitched,haunting,great debut,loved it
B008M7ELLM|5.0|It allowed me to see the entire season in order. It also allowed me to refresh my memory on previous episodes as well as gain a new perspective on subsequent episodes.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I've seen the DVD but I wanted a refresher so I bought the book. It helps me to keep focused and think in a positive frame of mind.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Well - we didn't get it yet because it was a pre-order, but we expect it soon and know we'll love it, we saw the movie in the theatre and my daughters will be happily surprised when they get it for Easter!<br /><br />The movie itself can be a little frightening for small children since the bad guy in the movie is the &#34;Boogey Man&#34;, but good movie.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Great album! Every track is amazing. Would recommend to all who are considering! Great listening while sitting in traffic. Helps me get an upbeat start to my day
B0014LX420|5.0|Good stuff - makes me wish Britney would go back in time and start making this kind of music again, good album and great deal!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very well done, there is nothing better than playing this and listening to the music of lionel richie<br /><br />i mean it
B00AHXIC50|4.0|i was excited to get this album, Bruno Mars is quickly rising up my playlist, especially with the newest song &#34;When I was your Man&#34;.  He's definitely different, some songs sound old school, some just different, but I like almost everything.
B000002LCB|3.0|Which is why I got it. It was cheap enough so that I got the CD because the MP3 of Mark Knopfler's song would be more than if I bought the entire CD.
B007RI56NY|4.0|This is the 1st album I've bought of Train's, and I like it so far.  Love &#34;50 Ways&#34;, and Mermaid sounds like Adam Levine in parts, crazy.  Good stuff.
B002ZTIIXK|4.0|I've always loved &#34;Constant Craving,&#34; but her updated rendition of &#34;Hallelujah&#34; blew me away. It's a hard song to sing, but she OWNS that song.
B009738XXM|3.0|I mainly bought this CD because of the great deal, and because my daughters love &#34;Call me Maybe&#34;.  I was disappointed in many of the other songs, I guess I knew she's kind've a &#34;teeny bopper&#34;, but it was even more &#34;teeny&#34; than I thought it would be, wish a side of cheesy.  If I had it to do over again I would have just purchased the 1 song.
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely wonderful.  I want more. I hope there will be additional chapters.  I want to see Ana and Christian grow.
0525950079|5.0|Fast forward 200 years after Pillars of the Earth.  Well written--love Ken Follett!  What a time in history it was!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was an amazing story of four friends and there  adventure to the wonderful city of oz this was amazing story and i would totally read it again. I recommend this book for anyone .
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I found the puzzle game to be fine & fun to play but the other parts where cubes keep popping up as you're playing, is very confusing as to how to play it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Oh. My. God. I just.... I can't think of words. Amazing. Extraordinary. A beautiful disaster. This is exactly the type of book I was looking for, and I finally found it!!! I just wanna cry because I'm so happy!!!
0307346617|1.0|I don't see why this book is so popular. I was totally bored after the first 15 pages. 100 pages in and I had put it back on the shelf, not even worth finishing.
0525948023|5.0|I love this book. It has given me a whole new way of looking at things and understanding people. It's definitely something I will read over and over again. Very cerebral.
B009JZVT70|5.0|Love, love, love Once upon a time!! It is so creative, romantic and fun to watch, so nice to watch something clean that even my kids can watch as well as me. It's a pure treat to watch!!<br /><br />Amazon instant video was a great way to get caught up, it was easy to use and it only costed the price of a movie. Well worth it!!
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|I grew up reading the Conan stories written by Robert Howard,so this movie feels right. Uneven,things may not fit exactly or you have no idea where that character came from--but true to the original Conan stories. Not polished nor a continuation of the older Conan movies(those long silences where the characters stared into each others eyes were boring) so while it could have been better--it was good for what it was. An action sword and sorcery with blood violence and an occasional half naked woman thrown in. Which is how the Howard Conan stories were.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Sure, I'm glad that a movie about Hitchcock was made as I am a classic black and white movie buff, but first of all it should have been titled something else.  It not a biography, but only a snap shot of a pivotal chapter in his career.  While Anthony Hopkins is a wonderful actor, his portrayal just wasn't enough for me.  I found myself hearing Hopkins and not Hitchcock.  There wasn't much magic or stylish attributes that are typical of the actual Hitchcock movies.  Nothing was really revealed about Hitchcock's life other than this short time period of the late '50's, early '60's.  We didn't get to see him as a family man or his rise to exceptional director.  I wanted to know more about him, not just the battle to get Psycho to the screen.  What was nice was learning more about his wife, Alma, portrayed wonderfully by Helen Mirren.  The other lead actors, Scarlett Johansson  and Jessica Biel were spot on and deftly cast. In particular, Scarlett Johansson as Jamie Lee Curtis' mother was outstanding and captured the spirit of Janet Lee.  Its a good movie but disappoints regarding learning much about Hitchcock other than this one battle in his film career that, admittedly, changed our perceptions of his legacy but hardly touches on the total HITCHCOCK.  Rent it but don't expect a Hitchcock styled movie.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|You have to disable the default spacebar behavior of choosing the suggested word, but after that it's perfect, and a compelling advantage of Android.
B000SVZIOE|5.0|The kids just  love this movie.  They will watch it all day.  It is worth the Money buy buy buy
0307744434|2.0|The author has an unusual imagination.  And, she paints a wonderful picture of the story she tells.  The problem is the story is totally unrealistic.  Magic, people vanishing, dead people walking around and talking to people living.  Of what value is this to anyone?
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|The kids just  love this movie.  They will watch it all day.  It is worth the Money buy buy buy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I'm always on it every day I play from probraly on the game from 3 to 4 hours!!&#9733;&#9733;
B00005RHGL|5.0|Love the extra footage!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved the entire series, I can't wait for the next book. The dance was a wreck, I hope my dance won't end like that!
0205313426|5.0|Anyone who contemplates writing needs to have three books at their disposal. Strunk & White, The Elements of Style, Stephen King's On Writing and Woe is I by Patricia T O'Conner. Beyond this, a great imagination wouldn't hurt.
0670024813|5.0|Jared Diamond writes an interesting comparison/ analysis of a wide range of cultures.  It is definitely worth purchasing and certainly a must-read.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I love John Grisham but this book is for younger readers so it's probably great for them.  I enjoy his regular novels better.
0307592731|3.0|I thought this book would be more about the PCT than what was written.  It is more about the author's life before her hike started and how she found herself during the hike and after it was finished. I did, however, get some useful tips for our section hike we're planning this summer.
B005HSL626|3.0|It is fun, Every time I try to beat my high score the game just seems to get harder and my score gets worse.<br />Maybe if I buy the full version it will get easier.  Till then I am giving it 3 stars.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This is a book I could hardly put down.  I love the way Steinbeck weaves the characters together.  It was an excellent book.
0307463745|5.0|Great book, I enjoyed reading this analysis of a startup business. I understand the authors say their methods are counter intuitive, but I find them logical and appropriate. It really showed me where my own employer does very well and not so well. I would try to implement a lot of the same practices if I started a business.<br /><br />It is written about a software business and so some of the language about scaling the company doesn't translate to a service business.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|A good book.  I wasn't expecting the end of the book.  It was sad to me, I wanted to cry.
B000M341RI|5.0|I missed this movie when it first came out and did not find it until about 6 months ago.  It's now a favorite.
B005T87QCI|5.0|My son and I love this game and the movie!  I was glad to finally be able to fight as Atom and Twin Cities- but how come there are no crowds in the updated backgrounds?  I worked on &quot;REAL STEEL&quot; and can vouch for the authenticity of the new environments - but I miss the cheering crowds!
0307277453|5.0|I had lost my copy for class and needed to replace it quickly so I could finish my college semester.
B000FCK65W|4.0|At first this story that was set back in the depression era was real depressing but I couldn't put it down.  It took until close to the end before I was able to find happiness in it.  That is not a bad thing, it is a realistic thing.  Don't give up on it, read it to the end.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|A friend recommended this to me and I'm glad she did.  I've always been a fan of Jane Austen and this was a good interpretation of the story.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I like all of D. Baldacci books.  Lots of mystery and excitement  Kept you wondering and wanting to keep reading..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for free highly recommend to other people graphics quality but music ok.overall a great game over the age of 5
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I didn't like the presentation of the puzzles on a smart phone screen.<br />I wanted to see more basic larger formats so that theycan be seen on a smaller screen.<br />The graphics were good.  It  might be better on a larger screen.
B007TKT2SK|3.0|This app is very helpful but I can't say that I love this app  if you need help then you should get this app IT works great on my kindle fire. : )
B0063GORYU|5.0|We travel a lot. So quick games seem to make the trip go by faster. Fast and fun game. Would recommend.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it took me a whole week to Finnish it lol and I'm going to read it again
0790729628|5.0|Harrison Ford plays a cop from the future whose only job is to hunt cyborgs (human replicants) who have illegally returned to Earth.  The only thing is, these cyborgs don't play fair, and they don't want to be caught.  Complicating things is a young lady (that may or may not be a cyborg) that Ford's character falls in love with.  Rutger Hauer and Daryll Hannah give very good performances as two of the cyborgs.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Best movie and deservedly so.  Affleck created a well tied together period piece that was exciting and mostly factual.  Good acting all the way along.
B004UIOUHC|4.0|But it really depends on what you are using it on. On lower end pad like Polaroid, it was a great browser. Where the stock(IE) browser was always crashing or hanging. The Opera ran great! Now on an upper end pad like my Touchpad IE runs great and Opera is always hanging & crashing. Try it, very simple to learn how to use for a mobile app. And is fairly quick.
0061785652|4.0|Is it possible to write an exciting thriller that combines the Lewis and Clark Expedition, nanotechnology, the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, native American folklore, a lost city and a government agency out to stop a world wide conspiracy? Apparently it is. Rollins' novel is full of action as well as tidbits of history, romance, up to date technological information and a terrific twist at the end.<br /><br />I always find Rollins' books to be a little over the top, but I always find them fun--kinda like the old pulp adventure novels--and I keep coming back and reading the next one. This one would make an ideal read at the beach or on a long plane trip to make the hours melt away.
B0000D8HDF|3.0|It is a delight to listen to the Lizst transcriptions of the Beethoven Symhonies, however the symhonies lend themselves to dual piano performers rather than a single piano as featured in this album. Many of the transcriptions in this set are quite nicely performed, particularly the first 6 symphonies, with the exception of the Eroica which is not well played. The 7th and 8th are OK and the 9th is, what can I say, perhaps the greatest piece of music ever composed, but less than a satisfying performance in this album, particularly the 4th movement. All in all, worth it's moderate pricing, but don't buy it if you're looking for Beethoven masterpiece recordings. If you are very familiar with the symhonies and want to hear someting unusual, then this is a good addition to your collection.-
B0002XMKYE|5.0|Now that it has been converted to a DVD, it has enhanced sound and better video than the previous VHS tape, General Patton was a unique individual in an army that wants conformity. I love his personality, not to mention that he was a genius as a field commander.<br /><br />The only other General who would be similar was General MacArthur. The movie about him is also very good.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this backpack to be used for traveling.  I can put my D5100, speedflash, two lenses and battery, there was still room to put more without cramming .  The bag has an additional pocket for my ipad and iphone also.  The bag itself is light not heavy.<br />Construction is solid and has enough pads all around. The only thing I don't like is the small  horizontal strap to hold the two shoulder straps together.  It positions right at my neck area. I don't use it when I carry the gears walking.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|On the 20th anniversary of this musical, the work remains fresh and enchanting. The chorus and individual singers do full justice to the creators' ideas.
B000H305U0|5.0|Wow, when I ordered this cd, I didnt except to be writing a review for it. It is such a good disc that not writing a review would be an injustice. I love it, it is now on daily rotation in my car every song is enjoyable not a side of Justin Timerlake I was excepting.
B001P1MZNI|3.0|A bit disappointed.  Sound mix was uncomfortable. It was a live recording, so understandable. A lot of the humor & topical references are quite dated.  Some politically inappropriate references.  Not the warm, smooth Sinatra I'd hoped for
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I love this movie, the cast is amazing! Damon and Wahlberg work so good off each other, and Dicaprio's performance is amazing.
B007T2XC7A|3.0|Darker, edgier than other material by her that I've heard.  Not as pleasant a listening experience although she is good
B006MW3UZW|5.0|TV shows could not get any better than this. Its quite a contrast to hollywood/AMerican TV shows. We like how there are no special effects. This has improved the quality of weekend life for us!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Flight was a movie built around an amazing, though fictional, event. An inebriated airline captain uses his vast experience and knowledge to pull off a maneuver which saves most of the lives on board his doomed airliner. The story leading up to the event showed some promise with the introduction of Denzel Washington as the airline captain and an as yet unrelated female co-star's (Kelly Reilly) story line involving her drug use. The moving tends to bog down after the miraculous stunt pulled off by the pilot. It then becomes a character study of Denzel as the flight captain as well as that of the female costar (Reilly) as they meet and form a relationship. The remainder of the movie involves the drunken antics of the airline captain as his life stalls and he descends to his own bottom. In general, the movie left this viewer unimpressed as it devolved into somewhat stereotypical characters and their various attempts to deal with the fallout. I will say that Bruce Greenwood and Kelly Reilly were very good as co-stars in an otherwise average movie. Flight left me with the feeling that the movie had a sterling cast of actors whose talent was less than well spent on an average script.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|My wife's favorite movie; always watches it at Christmas time. Just wanted to have it on DVD as we only had a VHS tape of it.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I heard a review that referred to it as, &#34;the passion of the Batman&#34; because of how much Batman suffers in the movie. So I never saw it in the theater and waited until the price had come down on the blu-ray before I got it for home. I didn't think it was nearly as much torture & 'painful' as the reviewer had described. Instead it was a portrait of perseverance and self sacrifice under extreme pain, humiliation and difficulty. Good action.<br />It did make a good point that well intentioned lies can backfire. The 2nd movie had the cover-ups about Dents crimes (Batman took the blame for them and was accused of Dents murder) and Alfred's destruction of Rachel's letter that she choose Dent over Bruce. Those lies built a foundation of sand that easily crumbled under stress, and the 'better future' that it was hoped that they would provide was a weak future that didn't have the strength to endure.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Best Lincoln book I have ever read. Really did a great job of showing Lincoln's true genius. Really great writing as well.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This movie follows the book. The next movie is due to be released this year and I hope it is as faithful to Rick Riordan as this one was.
B001E1DJD4|4.0|It works fine, but it came with soft cover (paper cover).<br />I am not sure it is official CD from the company...<br />In the middle of the CD, there is gap.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is such a charming game, based on the story  of Phileas Fogg, Passepartout and their trip around the world. The music is really nice and relaxing and puts me in a calm mood. I like that I can replay the same match three over and over to beat my best time. Simple, relaxing, fun and addictive. I've installed it on my Kindle Fire HD and have been playing with it for about 3 weeks. It works perfectly and the graphics are beautiful.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really like this season. I think it's a lot better than the second season, which in my opinion didn't really pick up until the last three episodes. This season has a great addition of new characters which I love.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book kept my interest from beginning to the end. I just kept waiting for the plan to fail and then.....well, you should read it now to see what happens!
B0019HQIFE|5.0|This Blu-ray is of great quality. A perfect reproduction of a great concert. John Mayer plays all three different incarnations of his music (acoustic, the Blues Trio, and his hits with the band). The perfect concert for all JM fans.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|works as expected. Not much to say bout thermal paste. Have not noticed much of a decrease in temperature but have noticed a more consistent idle temp. doesnt jump up n down a few degrees like previous paste did. used coolermaster brand paste b4. shipped fast as always.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was so so so so good I can't wait till I read the second book. Best book ever
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Gives great insight as to what it is like in the situations he faced in his military career. Is told on a &#34;personal&#34; level like the author is talking to you one on one. several good laughs also.
B002UNMW7O|3.0|It's entertaining even if is a bit forced, humor-wise. I'm a fan but the effortlessness of the first movie is lacking in it's sequel even if the plot is intriguing.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|My 2 year old loves this set and would play with it every day.<br />The pieces are not too small, just right for kids their age..<br />Would definitely recommend to others.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy this game very much, but to improve you could make the levels a bit more adventurous and funnier! Xxx
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Definitely the most \\"pop\\" sounding of their albums, that's not a bad thing. Catchy but still lyrically deep, I loved it- and I've been a fan since If It Was You.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|this is a beautiful game for any one who likes match three games...I highly recomend you check this one out...I got it today for $1.99 ..... enjoyable
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was an excellent movie, being in my early 20's during that time frame I didn't pay much attention to Iran.  The movie had a lot of history that I was unaware of. I would recommend Argo to everyone.  Kerry
B00280LYIM|5.0|wow but still I prefer Thalia in it. You MUST read the the book never RATE this book one star people!!!!!!!!!!! It is AWESOME
1616550414|4.0|I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5 because it takes too much of the book talking about skyward sword. It would have been better to have more information from ocarina of time or a link to the past or games that really are classics. Besides that gorgeous pictures and interesting story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a very good game. Doesn't require you to purchase things in order to play a good game. I recommend it to any horse lover.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I received this very quickly, and had no problems downloading it onto my Windows 7 laptop. I bought it to control my Celestron NexStar 127 SLT telescope from my laptop, and it works beautifully.<br /><br />I had purchased a TrendNet R-232, and could not get it to download successfully, nor did my inquiries with TrendNet get any responses.<br /><br />It was nice to buy a product that did what it claimed it would do.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is awesome.  Pull out your money, buy this and plug it into your ears.  Do it right now. Do it.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|If you want the music and other features need to spend more money to upgrade.  Has 'm moot worked properly yet
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved every word. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this book (series) highly. Get them
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This movie was ok, but does not seem as original as the first series.  Does an ok job of explaining some of the background of the \\"programs\\", but is not really consistent with the \\"Behavioral Modification\\" theory mentioned in the first Bourne movie.  Overall, I think I would rather watch those movies Bourne Supremacy again than watch this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the whole series. This is a great read for anyone . I think it will become a classic
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Maybe I just expect too much out of the entertainment industry.  I guess I expect the film makers to out-do themselves every time.  This was not as original or suspenseful as the first two movies.  I understand trilogies sell - characters, boxed sets, all kinds of ways to make money, but each movie should improve upon the franchise.  No need to have a film just for the sake of explaining the background or holes/ sub-plots of previous movies.  Again, maybe I'm just asking too much.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|the sound the image are all great ,the only problem was i couldnt play it on the DVD put since i have my laptop i watched it all
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was different from the court case in most of johns book. I enjoyed the total story line, the planing and working plot to scew with the Feds.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!  Beautiful story about a girl who never knew what love meant and how she had to deal with emotions she had no tools to be able to figure out how to deal l with anything but anger.  I loved the whole connection of flowers and their meanings..fascinating!!  Would recommend this book to all my friends!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great fun for me and my 8 yo daughter. We played for hours and really enjoyed the lifelike horses. Give this one a try.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I am not used to Clint Eastwood starring in such a predictable movie.  Usually they have a twist of some sort. The characters were still enjoyable and I could sit through the movie without turning it off or taking a break.  The acting was good.  It is hard not to like an Eastwood move, but I sure hope the next one is better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The ending was so sad...no more district 12!!!!!! But I'm so happy that Katniss mother sister nd Gale git out safely. Can someone explain y they crippled the bombs in the first place. I what happened to Peeta he was mentioned at the end of the book but he wasn't actual there. CAN'T WAIT TO START BOOK THREE!!!!!!!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I usually play word games but this is so colorful it got my attention.  I really enjoy playing it and try to play at least 2 games every night!  My husband likes the music and when I have it turned down low, he makes a comment he can't hear it!  Fast paced and always different.  I am really enjoying Cubistry!
1423140591|5.0|Riordan has done it again! Rejoin Percy, your favorite demigod, in this amazing story of friendship and fate. Again, Hera has been up to no good, but can Percy and his new friends at Camp Jupiter help prevent the fall of mankind?
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I really am having fun with this and so are the Grandchildren. It will keep you in the Holiday spirit : )
1423113462|4.0|The Lost Hero is a fantastic addition to Rick Riordan's collection of mythical books. Join Jason, Piper, and Leo as they embark on a quest to fulfill the \\"Great Prophecy\\". Can they save Piper's dad? Will they be able to stop \\"Mother Earth\\" from rising?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have an Acer A100, and this app opens the whole world of Amazon to me. A &#34;Prime&#34; membership even makes it better.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|I remember seeing this movie way back in 1986. Molly Ringwald is one of my favorite actrisses. The pesentation of the characters are most excellent.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I wasn't sure I had received the correct USB cable when I first opened the plug but when I put it all together it fit great and I have been using it since that day with out problems and I have no complaints what so ever.  I was sent the correct item by the person I talked to which shows she was paying attention to  details and she knew her stuff.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Absolutely fantastic!  I don't remember the series looking or sounding this good, and the updated special effects are excellent!.  Heartily recommended!
B000002V07|5.0|Love this album. Very moving music.Bought this to replace the one I lost a while back. Love the AutoRip feature.
B000N6UERK|5.0|This is one of the best Denzel Washington movies I have seen. The Story is very fast pace and intriguing. The quality of the Blu-ray is very good along with the sound.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This film.had it all.  Even knowing the real life outcome, it was a nail biter!  Great direction, greater cast.  A well deserved best picture win.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|If you don't have any Jurassic Park movies yet this is a great bang for the buck. The video and sound quality is great would recommend this anyone that loves the series.
B00BESNKB8|3.0|Not the best Quinten T. film when compared to Kill Bill films.<br />The action was decent and the humor was okay, overall it's decent.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites of Brendan Fraser. The movie is very well written and provides entertainment for the whole length of the movie.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was like a romantic and funny book at the same time. The book told how it is like to try and find someone to go with you to a dance and also how some relationships end up in middle school. It's a quick lesson on the do nots of middle school.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I am not a surfer or great outdoorsman, but the storyline is inspirational and scenery is amazing. One of the things that attracted me to the movie was the quality of the blu ray and it was great . I love the ocean and the film does a phenomenal job and makes me wish I was there. It is also the sort of movie you can watch with your kids since it is a PG. So check it out and you won't be disappointed !
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good graphics... has hint button if you need it... like the different difficulty levels... if you like mysteries you should like this one
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A truly wonderful book.  Well worth your time. I cried at the end.  Made me think and feel differently about death.
0674048849|4.0|Thus book provides lots of material for the lover of Jane Austin novels.  It's like reading with a tutor whispering over your shoulder.
B00B19G01C|5.0|If you like action, and drama, and suspence. You'll love this one! It's better then the Exercist. It will leave you on the edge of your sit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy the game. My niece showed me it the other day and I can't stop playing it. Very addicting.
B00BKG4MN4|5.0|So far, I have enjoyed season 5 a tad bit more than season 4.  The return of Darth Maul is one major reason.  He was a great character in Episode 1 just in physical presence alone.  New depth for him in Clone Wars has been very pleasant to see.  Although the number of episodes dedicated to the droids mission seemed overboard, it did create a new perspective for telling the expanded star wars world.  The most enjoyable aspect for me though, hands down, was the confrontation of Darth Maul, Savage Opress, and Darth Sidious.  The Clone Wars creative staff did an amazing job showing why Mr. Lucas stated Lord Sidious was the best swordsman in the galaxy.  The fact that they even showed off his signature move from Episode 3 was delightful.  Any Star Wars fan must add season 5 to their collection.  Now the hard part will be waiting for season 6!
B008PHN6F6|5.0|There's a reason why this film earned 11 academy awards, and is possibly the best of all time. The cast was perfect. The sets were the most beautiful, and very accurate to the real ship. The story was excellent, even though you knew what happens to the ship. And the special effects were top notch. Not to mention James Horner's groundbreaking score! Which is still my favorite, and listen to it several times a week. James Cameron, you are &#34;The King of the World!!&#34;. Thank you for this masterpiece!!
B005D6O1GK|5.0|The crocs were as pictured and comfortable.  The price was outstanding. Will enjoy wearing this Spring and Summer. Colors are a good compliment to a light outfit.
0062073192|5.0|Great book!! It's tell me how the story start and show me the bromance between dean and Sam since they were young. The spn family would love it.
0812413741|5.0|Bought this for a friends first child. Knew they would love it because it is such a great kids book
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|so easy to find in the search engine, I loved the price. I will be buying other movies from here.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Don't believe the hype about the alternative lifestyle that the news talks about: any sort of kinky sex here is mostly fluff, tease, and doesn't really explore the emotions of it in any meaningful way. To sum up the series you can say: girl meets man, man is dark and damaged, man also happens to be in to rough sex apparently due to being damaged, the rough sex/kinkery is teased at but never explored fully, girl and man have some implausible adventures, girl fixes man, the end.<br /><br />The book isn't very well written, the story line jumps from plausible to implausible pretty quickly, and the most interesting part (the kink) is only on the surface. Now the series is not without merit, it is written competently enough to make you want to know more and find out if there is ANY satisfaction from the story. However, it can never deliver enough emotional satisfaction to make it a worthwhile adventure it all. This makes it sort of like a trashy pulp story - but trashy pulp stories usually at least have some emotional satisfaction by the end.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This is a very interesting thing that someone asked me to order but after getting it and assepbly of it it works amasing and it a good shot as well. thanks

B00AFROVQC|4.0|This is a good fantasy book. World build by the author is unique and interesting - actually I consider it as one of the strongest points of this book.  Characters are well made (especially Argon, with his aura of mystery around him), and setup of the royal family comes nicely with the plot. Main character is likable, and does not &#34;feel&#34; special at all - that is probably a good thing. Addition of animal familiars is in my opinion also a nice choice.<br /><br />I give 4/5 because i believe some characters could require more attention from the author (considering it is first book of the saga, there is still time for that), and plot seems to me a bit &#34;rushed&#34;. Nonetheless I greatly enjoyed this book.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|I picked this book up as part of The Verge's ([...]) book club. I'm happy that this was chosen as I don't usually do much science fiction and I otherwise would not have read it. PKD's writing and narrative style can be a little rough at times, though his fans say that is part of his charm, but the story is good and a lot of the things he imagined for the future are eerily true; microtransactions to live your life and various bits of tech to name just two. Considering that it is a quick read and won't take up to much time it is a worthwhile buy.
B00881VLCE|4.0|lots of puzzles,good subjects, choice of difficulty is good,puzzle pieces presented individually,not massed,that is good.<br />the pieces presented on strip lack contrast making it difficult to see exact shape.  i like this app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've read this book two or three times by now and ordered it again for my Kindle. The author creates a believable story line of what could happen during a Zombie war and, more importantly, gets to the human nature of surviving any war. I've read accounts of WW2 and surviving it and in a lot of ways this text is similar.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Good animation and story pacing that stays true to the material. Some slight necessary changes here and there so the content won't be dated. A very nice surprise.

B005LJK3AC|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch. A good cast with some funny one-liners. Not a family movie but a good date night flick.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Everyone raves about this book which probably made my expectation too high; however, I was not thrilled about it.<br />The two main characters' roles changed too dramatically for me. And frankly the first two thirds of book seemed to drag.
B0055OK2T0|3.0|Nothing special here. A good movie but not worth buying. You can rent it and it is watchable, but forgettable. If you have another choice, then make it.
B006G2124E|5.0|It really makes you think. I think it was truer to the book than some. We liked it a lot.
B008IYOEZM|1.0|As a die-hard Dexter fan I can say that this season is unforgivably awful.  I would say that Colin Hanks is the major fault with this season (his father can act, he definitely cannot).  But more than that the story line is forced and trite, like the authors were desperate to integrate religion.<br /><br />Boo-hiss.  Dexter writers created an abysmal failure with this season.  Season 7 however, is the much deserved apology to this garbage, pre-order and enjoy Dexter the way it should be (season 7, that is.)
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Wow! Parts of this book are quite disturbing but I found the story line so well written it just swooped me up.  I couldn't put it down after the first few chapters.<br />I've read all three of Gillian Flynn's books and found them so well written, I can't wait for the next.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Wonderful series I can not wait to start watching the third season. I was not sure i would like the series but I do.
0446547654|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author.  I have read every novel he has written and have kept each one.  Excellent love stories.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|When I first watched this I was not sure i would like it but as i continued to watch it I enjoyed it good series Can't wait to watch Season 2.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Never heard of him til we watch his documentary film. His talent is unbelievable and I hope his Cd will sell well. I think he is better than Dylan.
B005PK553C|5.0|I just the hate the fact its over. I watched season 1 on Amazon after watching season 2 on tv and I cant decide which one I like more. Awesome show!
0525423842|4.0|Didn't know this was supposed to be for kids, but enjoyed it as I have all of John Grisham's books. Found it interesting and a great easy read.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|My wife and I really enjoyed this movie, Ben Affleck is a boss director and it is a shame he wasn't nominated for best director for his work on this movie.
B004UQ03P2|5.0|Very easy to install. Just follow the instructions and even a non techie like me can do it in a jiffy. Simply wonderful
1451695195|5.0|My 21 yr old son was killed in a car accident. After reading this I  know I will see him again and that he is still with me.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|There were some original ideas in this series that were a great foundation and could have grown into a great series but there were just too many issues to count.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the book is that it reads like a child's daydream. Everything (fantasy related) that you could possibly dream of wanting to happen to you when you were a kid? It happens to Thor, the hero of the book. Your parents and siblings marginalized and shown as the jerks they are? Check! Future king? Check! Great warrior? Check! Princes falls in love with you? Check! Current king basically adopts you? Check! Most powerful wizard ever? Check! Your very own animal familiars? Check! You're the one who always saves the day no matter what? Check! I can't even count the times that someone is praising Thor or owing their life to him.<br /><br />Which brings up another point; the endless repetition. So many times the phrase \\"in a way he'd never felt before\\", or some approximation thereof, was used to describe Thor's powers. Basically, nothing was left to the reader to discover on their own, and the greatness of the good characters (not just the hero) was pushed over and over and over (and over!); so much so that in the end I was kind of hoping someone would come along and kill them.<br /><br />Which brings us to the evil characters. There wasn't any depth to them; they were just unabashedly evil with no redeeming qualities whatsoever, not even intelligence.<br /><br />The entire series just reads like something a 6 year old would concoct in his/her head while she was mad at mom and dad and has an \\"I'll show them how great I am and poopy they are!\\" kind of quality.<br /><br />Add to that the poor editing (which just gets worse in the 2nd book and then worse again in the 3rd) and it's unreadable. My only excuse for buying the second and third books is that ... I didn't, my husband did and HIS only excuse is \\"Well, I was sure it had to get better! Nothing could be that irredeemable right?!\\"
B00A80SHFM|2.0|I was skeptical to start out with. I was very disappointed in this. It did not give me chills like it does when listening to a Broadway Recording. It sounds like someone took a couple of people and recorded the songs with crappy equipment in a basement. Also, most of the songs were cut down. \\"On my own\\" is missing two verses and the opening is supposed to be around 7 minutes. Very bad. I would recommend buying a Broadway recording or concert recording.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I fell in love with Hey Ho. When I got the Download. i love every song on the whole thing
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Having retired from the Navy, I may have appreciated this book more than most. I also would say that a lot of Chief Kyles observations and comments about the enemy he was sent to kill may make a liberal's head explode. He definitely is not politically correct in his thoughts or statements. But I don't know about you, but that's what I want in our elite forces.He felt that each one of the people he killed was justified in that they were out to harm either innocent civilians or allied troops. When you read the process he had to go through to terminate a target, you will appreciate that snipers are held to a very high standard, and basically have to justify each kill.<br />I also thought that putting his wife's thoughts and emotions throughout the book was a great addition to the overall story. Makes you appreciate the hardships that the family left behind has to endure. I believe I saw an interview with him online that said he was home a total of 3-4 months the last 3 years of his service. If you are prior military, you will understand the crass humor and just basic way we look at life. If your a civilian, you may not get it, but it will be a fascinating read for you to understand what it takes to become one of the elite, a Navy SEAL.  OohRah!
B001HPP2XW|5.0|I bought this movie for a present.  My friends she's a fan of the classic movies.  I like it, too.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|...piece of history with a treat at the end. Just when i thought it was over, it goes on to tell of the 'reunion' and recording of the project. I was glued to the screen from the start and will watch it over and over.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|A very good read. No fluffy backstory  - just a guy who was there telling his story as it happened.  Enjoyable!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like it. I use it. Nothing really special about it. I just like having my weather so I can check it.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|So much potential, but short of the mark. Fabulous story concepts and character basics, but the plot is silly, shallow, and a bit anticlimactic. A few funny moments...but not a beautiful animation experience.
B0054LJGWS|3.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.<br />He and I obviously have vastly different tastes. I gave it 3 stars<br />because we are friends.  I am now wondering why.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|To me it was a slow read at first, but kept me intrigued enough to get through.  Once I get through the slow parts I was hooked.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is the best game I've found for my kids they love it now I just have to get them stop fighting over who gets to play first
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the best book of the trilogy by far.  You see the characters evolve and change and grow.  Truly a great love story, not just a &#34;porn&#34; book.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good character development. Similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey. Such a good book. Well worth the read and I look forward to the third installment
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great continuation and development from the first book.  The story line took me on an unexpected journey.  There is much more to this book than just the sex scenes.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game!<br />I really like to play with my pets!<br />I really like this game!<br />I think is the best ever!
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|The girls love it It's really a good movie according to them  They said make more like this Good movie
B00BBW15R8|5.0|this movie is fantastic. Omar Sy is lovely in this movie. He has the greatest smile.  the story is warm and the characters make it come alive. I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it.
1616550414|5.0|My son loved it It was for his birthday and he said it was excellent And made his birthday wonderful
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i havent played that much but so far it seems like a good game. there are a few glitches though.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. All about a boy coming to terms with his past, falling in love, making mistakes and friends.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Loved it! Daniel Craig is the only Bond to rival Sean Connery, who I thought was the best Bond ever!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Feel like your taking a step back in time to the era of HenryVIII. Well written, acted, and believable. Not to be missed!
1616550414|4.0|At first, I was slightly disappointed when I looked through this book.  I expected it to be a book full of actual gameshots.  As I looked through the book further, however, I came to admire how the authors explained the history of Hyrule as a whole.  Need more info on the history of a particular character or place within Hyrule?  Look no further than this book!  As a bonus, there is a comic at the end that adds another unique touch to things.  I definately recommend this book to any hyrule fanatic!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app, its very fun and interactive you get addicted to this games very easy and you don't even know that it happeneds you just suddenly look at the clock and you've been playing for hours!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I was an English major at the University of Michigan. I want to call my Alma mater and ask for part of my money back for none of my courses requiring this work. Best book I've ever read. Follett has an extraordinary talent for weaving story lines and character development. The book is gigantic but it's totally worth it. Ridiculously intellectually stimulating. Would give 12 stars if I could.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The Beatles in Mono is awesome. These are the original mono mixes for UK and Europe. Before Stereo became very popular. Pepper was mixed in Mono first. But for the US Market it was mixed in stereo. If like The Beatles It is worth buying and having in your collection. Sounds great when played loud!
B007K3JCAE|5.0|If you doubted the greatness, all I'm going to say is: Intricate story. Superb cinemetography. Excellent directing. Phenomenal acting. Enough said.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It was a refreshingly new point of view to a very sad time in human history. I definitely enjoyed reading this book.
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|I don't know why people are hatin' on this movie. It lacked the human element in its other films and they wove it in in this one. Toward the end, it swerved back to the regular theme but it was clearly well laid out. Kate is Underworld. She carried the film (glad there was no Michael...his acting is piss-poor), as always. The special effects were on point, the stunts were excellent and the story actually moved very well. I may be an Underworld junkie but I would dig it even if I weren't.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Still in the process of reading this book via Kindle and I am amazed by the great information.  I even purchased the &#34;Teen&#34; Secret book for my grandson.  What an awesome bonding tool for us.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Overall a good, honest, sometimes funny, heartwarming read.  It took a few chapters to get past the writing style for first person point-of-view, considering the character`s background, but totally worth getting through to enjoy the whole novel.  Can't wait to see the movie now!
B000SDQZ4Y|5.0|Like all the Black Sabbath albums before it, this a true masterpiece top to bottom with all songs strongly fitting in seamlessly to make an album meant to be listened to as a whole together. I have listened to this album countless times and never felt the urge to skip over one song to hear another better song. That is always my first criteria for judging an album. It seems a lost art the making of true album. Now it seems acceptable to randomly collect a few singles mash it together with some  filler songs not fit for b-sides and call it an album.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Such a modern look inside the lives of young people today as they grapple with all the issues of adolescence. Great cast, wonderful music and memorable characters. The book is even better!
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Like most movies based on well written novels, this movie suffers the inevitable comparison. The movie is average at best were as the book is exceptional.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|aliens are awesome. Paul is a dry comedy that leans towards vulgar but in the end is pretty entertaining. Not for young kids.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|This album is amazing, I'm only sad I didn't discover Imagine Dragons sooner. This is an album I can listen to beginning to end without skipping or being tempted to skip a track.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I really enjoyed finding out the mind that most are terrified to look into of the infamous Marilyn Manson.  I have longed to know for myself what made this creative individual.  I couldn't put this book down.  Looking forward to reading it again.  Mr. Manson will always be a favorite entertainer and now author.
B00AEBBAF4|3.0|I didn't realize this was only the director's cut. Not as good as the theatrical version. Returned it to get the original version.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Very well written, show engulfs you for hours. I sat down and watched episode one and before I knew it the day was gone. The show's story line and characters are amazing, so much depth for a show about an outlaw mc.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|It was an amazing story little known and unexplored before now of our former presidents and how they learned to understand each other's trials and tribulations and to form bonds as only members of such a unique club can do.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is the &#34;Best&#34; show on television. I am happy to own the series so I can watch it again and share the experience.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't stop watching because I want to know what will happen next.  Excellent acting -- characters seem real to me.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best app ever it is so cool I cant even say how cool it is this is totally worth seven bucks this should be ten becks
B00006CXSS|4.0|It was a birthday gift.  He is a high school history teacher and loved it.  After he looks at it he said he can also use it in his classroom on occasions.
0765325950|5.0|All the loose ends are finally tied up.  The action is pretty much non stop.  I wish we could have got more details on some of the various story lines but I suppose that would mean it would have been another book.  I absolutely love this series!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It was a Christmas gift for my nephew.  He collects the Batman movies and he was thrilled to add it to his collection. I love checking items out on Amazon.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|My anticipation was a lil stronger than the actual fully filled expectations the actual life expressed is depraived and worthy of bein noticed sick and empty confussions
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is epic BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first time you need to get the hang of it but after a few go's you will be addicted to the game
B007IQWQ88|5.0|Very nice plan Box set, I wish it will be continue Karanjan 70, 80 in European version.  I will buy.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|An interesting travel through time to explain why the world of today is the way we are used to see it.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|I realy wish all of his original albums(miniature). streao also. the album size is little bit bigger than other artists.
B00001W9G0|5.0|This DVD was very enjoyable to see again. After ordering it, it arrived promptly and in good condition. Now we own it ...to watch again and again.
B000002I53|5.0|I have no doubt this CD sounds better than the vinyl album I had back in the late '60's!<br />This album was Coltrane's first independent one, with his own quartet; it should be required listening in every music class, starting in preschool. it's American Jazz from that unique time in American music- post Big Band and pre- electric.<br /> John goes DEEP in exploring and releasing the emotion and colour in every song he plays. I could listen to McCoy Tyner on piano all day!
0800141660|5.0|The performances of Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant make this rendition of Sense and Sensibility. This is my favorite version of this work by Austen. The absolute best! Buy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I need world tour Rome I tried to uninstall and install but it didnt work so if you know how to update send a review
B005K17RU0|5.0|Like this better than MSN Weather or others. Seems to be correct most the time. Easy to use and has extra search features.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Not too hard for beginners. I play with my very favorite daughter and her friend.  It does take me a while to figure out the drawings but they are very quick in figuring out my drawings!! LoL!!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Very poor search tool..Does not have good navigation and links that do not work. Switched to another tool. YP app which is lots better for looking up information.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Good movie I was saprized, didn't look to good and I didn't hear good ratings on it but when I watched it, I liked it very much good fight sences  and good story
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love this game so much. its super addictive. the only thing is some games are super hard. but love it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is fantastic. I love it. There are so many levels and it almost exactly Mario brothers but that's a good thing g because there is no Mario game on the app store. Also its also fun to play with a friend. I would recommend this to any or who likes fun apps. The only difference between this and Mario is the characters. I love this app. I would so recommend keeps world 2.
B0042FZWC0|4.0|Simple easy to read with a lot of good advice. A must read for the vagabond out there. Enjoyed it very much
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This book is so real, you'll think you have Alzheimer's the next time you lose your keys.  A good example of how one family coped.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I started watching season 1 and became hooked on this series. I found out that season 2 was available through Amazon video library and ordered it. I don't have to worry about missing an episode because each episode is automatically added to my library.<br />Way to Go! for your favorite shows.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The author is pretty good at developing characters and stories. It moves along at a comfortable pace and the Jack Reacher character is fun to follow along, as are the others.<br /><br />But it's just a little too unrealistic for me to rate highly. I expect that kind of thing from a movie (I don't like it, but I've come to expect it) but there is no need that kind of fabrication when it comes to a novel. The author clearly know little to nothing about things like military service and law enforcement. There are also a lot of coincidences that make the story seem very contrived.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|The king of Pop, MJ, alias Michael Joseph Jackson continued the Midas touch. Coming in between \\" Off the Wall\\" and \\" Bad\\" was the best selling album of all time, Thriller. And a thriller it was. The music videos alone would have been worthy of lifetime achievements for most artists. Every song is a must hear. I think this was the pinnacle of his career. Check it out for yourself.
B0081BU42O|5.0|unlike scifi authors of interminable series, Banks gets better as he goes on. i don't remember much of anything of the earlier Culture series, Phlebotomy or Choice of Toys, whatever, but this one has some subtile [sic] humour and ships with entertaining character though the humans are mere riders on the storms. if i were given the opportunity i would definintely become an Eccentric ship miind. enjoyed reading this on kindling fireworks
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Two men awake in a room to find they are trapped, chained by their ankles to pipes. All they have is what's in the room: the clothes on their backs, a dead body in the middle of the room between them, and no clue as to how they arrived where they are. (anything more than that would only spoil it, and also not do it justice.)<br /><br />I just watched the first film in the series, and for a film that supposedly started the phrase \\"torture porn\\" this film is surprisingly short on gore. I've seen more gory effects on an episode of C.S.I.<br />They instead opt for the way more effective Hitchcockian-style: Most of the gore happens just out of frame, and leaves it up to your own mind to fill in the blanks.<br /><br />The story is a straight up psychological thriller, and very well written. I don't want to under sell this film for the horror hounds that haven't seen it yet. However, if you are looking for your blood and guts fix, this one is a little light on it's serving portions.<br /><br />I do have to say one thing though: Given that this film has no nudity, and not much gore, it still managed to gross a ton of money, and become very popular. So what does this say about modern horror films, where the story (what little there is) is mostly regarded as the boring bit between kills?<br />I also think that it's amazing the film turned out as good as it did. The film had HUGE hangups during production, and it's those restrictions that made it what it is.<br /><br />I can easily draw the comparison between the first Saw film, and the video game Alan Wake.<br />Both are very story driven, and for their respective mediums/genres that is usually a bad thing. What makes it work is how it's pulled off, plus the stories and situations for both are incredibly compelling.<br /><br />If you have never seen this film, throw all your preconceived ideas about it out of the nearest window because it's worth a watch.
B009O2XY12|2.0|I dont understand it yet...I guess I need my teenage daughter to help me figure out exactly what to do. Its probably simple but I just had it mistaken for another bubble  game I play on my phone with my 4 year old son. I'll get it sooner or later.

B00B0NDF26|4.0|I find this album average for Tegan and Sara.  No real surprises, just good music.  Had this album been from lesser artists, it'd be good or possibly great.  For Tegan and Sara, it's a workmanlike production.  Worth what I paid for it :)
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Same game as on facebook; it is neautral.  Same doesn't make it great but it allows you to play on another device.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a great app for kids.  My son has had hours of fun in the car playing on trips.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Awesome and addicting better than a lot of other shows I have seen. I cant stop watching episode after episode I have not been disappointed once
B006S039YU|5.0|Wishing this would come out of the Disney vault! Till then, I'm happy to rent it on Amazon. This is Disney at its finest.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I have always loved surfing movies, just for the scenery and watching the surfing shots. Soul Surfer is far above all other surfing movies. The storyline is awesome and since it is based on a true story, it is that much more compelling. I love the faith of the family that is woven throughout the movie. I believe even people that don't care for surfing would be inspired by this movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book. It is so AWESOME. It was the number one book.  It is so funny .<br /><br />Get it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing. Simply amazing. It makes you think about how everything affects each minute detail. Read this if you truly want to think in a different way.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The author did an excellent job in grabbing my attention through the whole book. Had a bard tome putting book down. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B000KJT8IG|2.0|I'm not sure this was such a good transfer of the film.  Secondly if I'd have known it was made in Mexico, using materials I could have done myself at home, I'd have not bought it.
B0083JCCX8|5.0|Even though I saw the movie I still couldn't get enough of this book.  It was a great read.  Definitely recommend it.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|The plot may be a little predictive but it is sweet. It brings back nice childhood memories. They gave all of the characters a really believable personality and the voice actors are superb. The visuals are also great. I would recommend this movie to all ages! You'll love it.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|It was action non stop with this book, I couldn't put it down.  It is quite graphic though so not for the faint hearted.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Really good book. I can't wait to read the rest of them. Definitely worth the time and the money. 5 stars!
0385334206|5.0|This is a good book. I'm rating this five stars because I got it at a great price and it arrived earlier than I expected. It's in great condition and I'm happy I bought it.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|Too long a tale. It took nearly 1000 pages to tell a story that could have been said in 300. The beginning and the end were good though.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a very magical book I hope you like it cuz I did luv it such a beautiful story so pretty
B00AFEY354|2.0|I expected Breakfast Club.  I expected Pretty in Pink.  I expected ..... you get the idea.  This is without a doubt one of the most depressing films I've seen in a while.  The previews are really misleading.  The acting is great, hence the two stars.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I have deleted and redownloaded this app three times. It still tells me that I have no WFI connection. I'm going to try the free Accuweather app. Good thing this was onsale for $.99
B00ABO609A|5.0|Very rarely does gay cinema provide a film that is raw, gritty and completely realistic with a story that drops the pretenses of stereotype and judgement.  Keep the Lights On is engaging, compassionate and honest.  We care about the story.  We care about the characters and the plight of the relationship that they have.  This becomes more than the everyday love and struggle of a relationship.  We see the good times exposing the bad times.  We see the endurance and the unraveling of love through the inability of coping with life.  I have not seen a film of this quality in gay cinema in years.  I am very proud of the actors for carrying this story, the writers for telling this story honestly, the director Ira Sachs for delivering a fluid piece of intelligent work and the producers for getting this project off the ground and delivering this film based on its merits without being preachy.  Keep the Lights On is more than a realistic portrayal of gay life and culture.  It's a film that reflects the modern portrayal of the hopes and struggle that really exists today.  This is brilliant filmmaking in all areas at its best.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Although not all that plausible. Perhaps Puller will meet Jack Reacher some day...although not very plausible either. Think I'll stick to Lee Child.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It is a wondrful movie and you would never know it was used.  It played well and had no defects.

0425263916|5.0|After reading the 50 Shades trilogy, I was looking for something else in the same genre.  I started with book one - Bared to You, now read book two - Reflected in You and can't wait for book three.  I just hope it arrives before my beach trip!
B004GJYR7I|1.0|That's all I can say, just as my review headline.  I was shocked at the poor quality..had I known this I would never have purchased this or the other two old flicks I purchased.  I have an older set of these movies with same poor quality and thought for sure they must have upgraded the quality.  Nope, terrible.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really loved this book. I guarantee, it will have you in tears by the end. It was truly perfect
141659521X|5.0|Have not read this, my son did, he said it was fantastic ripping awesome.  His words..that's all I can tell you. He's in his 20's.  Go for it! He's finicky about what he reads and loved this.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I could not put this one down!  A great space travel / survival story, the science seems to me is mostly spot on and the healthy dose of humor at times cracked me up. Almost a head nod to Apollo 13 (even referenced in the book) as to the limitless ability of smart people to pull unlimited rabbits out of a space helmet. I loved it and will put it up with some of my favorites from Heinlein, Haldeman, Varley and others.

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Awesome game, probably better than Minecraft.  The demo is way too short, though.  If anybody knows some awesome world seeds, please tell me.  &quot;Fire&quot; is a good one, so is &quot;Tiny Island&quot; (even though there's nothing tiny about it.)
B00BESKTMG|1.0|Turned it off after about 20 minutes.  I appreciate that it is meant to be over the top.  And that it was.  However, it was also boring.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I tried to play it,but it froze up. It was working at first. FIX THIS AMAZON! It's mot even worth buying it for free!

B00785P2QC|5.0|I was looking for a Sims game, like Sim City, when I stumbled upon this. I got it bc it was free, and I couldn't be more satisfied. Sim City was going to cost money, this was free. Can't beat that. As far as the reviews go I will say, there's probably so many bc  the game bribes u 2 write a review to earn bonus money for your city. So don't take all these reviews seriously. Me for instance, I am ONLY here to get the bonus. What I have written is true though, I'm just saying the others may not be.

B00BHMETKC|3.0|A bit over-hyped, but still a well made, well, acted film that offers up a solid entertainment experience.  Manage your expectations and you will enjoy it.
B005LAII3U|4.0|It's a good movie with incredibly good visual effects. The actors were good and acting was quite good as well. There is plenty of action, good story, it's not predictable but there is just still one problem with it that made me give it 4 out of 5 stars. The movie is not exciting. It is not boring, it's just okay. What I found quite cool, is the first scene where the main hero fights the authority squad. The angles for the camera were just great and it moved uniquely. The movie also has a three breasted woman like from original ''Total Recall'', however I did not find her as interesting as the original character. It just did not fit her. Not breasts, but the role, it wasn't for her. The movie is 2 hours long, has a big world to show us and generally very, very well done. I loved how they made robots and gave them life. The way they moved and acted, was just awesome to see. It's nothing like the original ''Total Recall'' and I can't say it's a remake. It possesses some elements from the original movie but also misses a lot of other elements. Therefore I can't consider it as a remake. It's a very good movie, just turned out to be not too interesting.
B005TZFZJC|4.0|I am a fan of Rihanna. I Love her music. I added this CD to my collection of Rihanna Albums. This album was different compared to her other works. I feel that she expresses, herself about what she wants from a Man and what shes ultimately looking for in this Life, which is Love. She really did a great job on this album. I personally enjoy it. However; if your not too much into the graphic language you may want the &#34;Clean&#34; version. Her photos are very Bold, Daring, Sexy and also Graphic as well. Overall it's a great album from Rihanna at a reasonable price. It makes a great gift, or just something to add to your collection.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The graphics in this app are very good. I really like the and it makes searching for the objects interesting.
B00136NUG6|5.0|EWF have been my favorite since the mid 70's.  This album is a nice addition to my collection.  Gratitude was the first album I ever purchased!  Have all of their albums/CDs and now downloads.  Been to see them in concert at least 8 times.  Really miss Maurice but still love Phillip, Ralph & Verdine.  Last saw them at DPAC in Sept 2011.  Hope they come back to NC soon!

B002UOQABC|5.0|Great compilation album, lots of covers and early stuff.  The dvd has a bunch of videos and a doc about the band.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun and addicting game! I think it better than temple run. There is a lot more things to unlock. I defiantly suggest it.
B00993FEUK|5.0|Incomparable, &#34;Norman&#34;  illuminates with a seamless physical flow, wide range of facial expression of it's &#34;people&#34;. I loved everything about it. The voices were spot on. And the special effects were really stunning. Supported by a beautiful soundtrack, it is a worthy addition to my collection.<br /><br />&#34;Coraline&#34; is also fun, it's animation improving upon that which came before. A precursor of &#34;Norman&#34; by a few years only.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best shows EVER. The writing, the cast....simply perfect. If you havent already, you simply MUST watch. You'll become a fan.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Head and sholders above the normal TV fair.  The acting is great and the settings (rooms, automobiles, clothing, etc.) are an education in and of themselves. Looking forward to Season 4.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book!  It's very well written and pulled me in from the beginning.  I couldn't put it down.  In fact, I reread it as soon as I was done.  I'm very much looking forward to &#34;Walking Disaster&#34;, which is his point of view.

1594744475|5.0|Not sure I'll be able to pull any of this off, but I love looking through this book over and over.
1439192812|5.0|The hardback is profusely--almost to excess--illustrated with colorful pictures and diagrams all over every single page, often under the text. The paperback has NO pictures. None at all. It's on cheap paper too, the kind that will discolor in a few years.<br />The hardback is, I suggest, much more appealing to younger readers. The paperback, perforce, focuses entirely on the text.<br /><br />The paperback is not just a cheap alternative. It comes across as a different book.<br /><br />Personally, I much prefer the illustrated version, although when under the text they can interfere with easy reading.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Sharp as a razor out of the box. I'm not scared to use this while I trek through the woods, or doing yardwork. Campanion was a well chosen name.
159562015X|1.0|There is a code in each book that is a one time use code.  I bought my book used not knowing about the code.  Now I cannot take the test.  Make sure that you buy it new so that you can take the test which is the most important part of the whole book!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well acted, directed, and scripted. The accents are not so thick you can't understand what tgey are sayin. McGonigal (from the Harry Potter movies) is excellent.

0312330537|5.0|This book was an epic and I can't wait to read more from him. The book was an enthralling look at India and so well written it was like a rich dessert each time I settled down to induldge myself. It took a while to get through since I am a busy person but it was truly, truly amazing.
1451695195|3.0|I have not finished the book, therefore, I cannot fairly rate it.<br />When I finish reading it, I can better rate the book.

B00122RFOO|5.0|I have been listening to this album for over 20 years...and it never gets old. Lyrics that slide through your thoughts and music to soothe a troubled heart...I can honestly say this is one of the finest compilations of music ever done.<br /> Just magic.

0425263916|5.0|First off, loved it. Second I want to get off of my chest is- everyone keeps saying how much this book is like 50! Really? I do see some similarities but not much. With that said I'm not going to give you a review that lists the reasons why or why not this is or isn't like that &#34;other series.&#34; I'm going to leave it at- this series holds its own, it should not be compared to another when its not &#34;really&#34; like that (or so this first book wasn't.)<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way lets get down to the nitty gritty! ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />It did take me a while to get into this. I loved it but it took me time to get there. Let me explain why- The characters are wishy-washy. They don't really want to tell each other why they are indeed messed up. Ana has flashes of what had happened to her and slowly pieces come into play. She only goes to says anything when she thinks that their relationship can come to an end if it gets wind. On the other hand we have Gideon, who is so fine and wound tight that I didn't know what to make of him. Then he starts to have night terrors and I can only assume what has happened to him because it is not yet explained. He doesn't like his family, he's stalker-ish in every relationship, over protective and at times can be a little over bearing.That's it. I didn't really get to have much &#34;feel&#34; for him as I would have liked but I did get a little insight to all that is Gideon Cross!<br /><br />Overall there are things that I want to understand and not have questions about, I hope these are addressed in Bared to You. I would recommend.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford & Sons Sigh No More is a beautiful album. I love the songs, and always play it on shuffle. It is a fun album to listen to.
1476715904|5.0|Wow, there is a lot that goes on in this book. There is the good the bad and the ugly. Some is just messed up and some is completely awesome.<br /><br />Characters overview- Lake, what can I say? She is very down to earth and is cool, laid back. She did grow up a ton in this from the beginning to the end. I'm very impressed with her and all the struggles that she had to avoid then overcome.<br /><br />Will, well he is just Will. I liked him even when he was wrong, blind with what he had right in front of him. I understand the choices that he has to make in his journey to get him from point A to B. I liked that he finally seen the light, at the end!<br /><br />Even with the obstacles that they endured (along with secondary characters) they pull through. It was always on how they proceeded to do what they thought was best at the time. They are overall, very much strong &#34;Main Characters&#34; to portray and even the secondary ones don't have it much better than the main ones. I'd read again and would recommend.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is another beautiful and thoughtful film from Wes Anderson. An coming of age story with beautiful scenery, and a well-rounded cast. I enjoyed his usual cast in their new roles. Bruce Willis was great.<br /><br />Although... I did miss the Wilson Brothers just a little!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Great songs, great voice, love me some Bruno!!  Would recommend to anyone if they are down for some soulful music
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I really enjoy this game but it keeps freezing up on me. It steals my game money I might have a lot of money and it randomly brings me a smaller amount. I really enjoy this game but it also annoys me very much so I love and hate it! :)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|The notepad notes are so handy.  I hardly forget things now, because they are right on my desktop!  And if I don't want them showing, I can &#34;hide&#34; them.  Great product!  Love it!!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Very, very addictive game!!!!! So much fun buying for my tank. I can play for hours. So glad there is a free version.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Initial Impression:<br />A adjustable weight system- It's a nice touch, but I simply put all the weight in the mouse and don't notice much of a difference. This isn't a feature I really use in mice before but having the option and the capability of making a custom heavier weight is a nice feature.<br /><br />8000 DPI- Wow, I've been playing on a max out Deathadder before the internal memory die, thus making the mouse useless and the Anker's mouse leaves it in the dust. The DPI is adjustable both in the software and a quick change switch on the mouse. To get this high of a precision mouse for this price is simply unheard of for the most part.<br /><br />Customizable color- Only applies to the anchor logo. It doesn't do green too well, the dark greens show up as teal. A minor issue, since your hand will be covering it. For the price, I didn't even expect the ability to change color. For 60-70 USD the Deathadder doesn't even provide this feature. It's also lets you put your small bit of flair on your system. I do wish you could disable the scroll wheel light or have the scroll wheel and anchor the same color. Another non-issue for me, but simply something I notice.<br /><br />Shape- It's a nice shape and fits hand well. You able to do either palm grip or finger grip with no discomfort. It is a larger style mouse, similar to the Deathadder. Actually bigger then what I was expecting due to the price.<br /><br />8 Buttons and Software- Wow, the buttons are very easy to customize. The software even has it records marcos and playback. Not a feature I would use a lot, but if you play MMO or other games where you need a lot of commands. This is a great feature.<br /><br />Final Word- I'm happy with this buy. The mouse feels to be of good quality, it has amazing tracking, the shape is good. I replace my Deathadder with an Anker and was able to save money plus get a higher DPI with better software(Synapse 2.0 is spyware, Razer remove their old drivers from the site). I even like the logo on the mouse. I simply don't think you'll be able to find a better mouse in this price range, with as many feature. Plus, it comes with a 18 month warranty. I'll do a update after a few months to see if I notice anything.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|While the game was initially interesting and even educational and kind of fun on how you had to achieve your goal, it became at the same time a little morbid and depressing as you move on in that your goal is to create the best virus that will kill the world in the sneakiest, most horrible and quickest way possible to win. You find yourself being happy that you are winning but you are winning because you just killed off in one day more people than HIV/AIDS and other major diseases like it. Not something to be jumping up and down about.  I only played it one time and could not finish it. My daughter got it after she saw me doing it and it just made her a little too happy about what she was doing(because she was &#34;winning&#34;). I made her uninstall it after that. Glad it was free. Just the thought of this being a game in the first place and you are the one causing these things to happen, makes it a little creepy. Too many wierdo's out there already who would really like to do something like this that don't need any help or encouragement! It felt too real because it had you using resources that were real things and real ways that could actually  manipulate a true virus and possibly lead to a plague if in the wrong hands with the right cash. I guess for that they accomplished the game developers goal so goody for them but why give crazy people more crazy ideas. Maybe some will say I'm overacting but this is just how it made me feel after playing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game it would be better if we got more boost up and more characters but otherwise from that I really like playing this game in my freetime at home and on roadtrips
B004I744AS|5.0|Not only a quick resource for dictionary needs, it has great games. My husband was obsessed with the one game where you have to find as many words possible within a certain word. If he didn't find them all he would be highly upset. I also love that it has a quick search for the word you are looking for to help you before trying to spell the whole word.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed the read.  Fast paced and very entertaining.  It would make a great movie.  Good job to Mr. Weir!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|My daughter and I had fun trying to figure out all the clues, etc. I like games like this. Too bad you had to pay for more of it but very entertaining.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|We aim to please! I just love Christian and Ana! I've read these books for the fourth time now and still can't put it down. Can't wait for the movie.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I bought these for my 4 year old daughter at Christmas. Where were they years ago when I could have played with them? I may have stayed up late playing with them after they were opened.<br />She was so excited to get Legos! Even better that they are &#34;girly&#34; colors instead of the mainly &#34;boy&#34; colors her friends have! It's almost 3 months later and she still spends hours playing Legos! She is in therapy for her fine motor skills and they are improving so much playing with these Legos!<br />This box comes with an instruction book to build a few different things, they are easy to follow and she enjoys doing this very much. She can also build her own creations! It also has a nifty tool for separating Legos that are stuck together (whoever came up with this is a genius! No more knives to get Legos apart, of maybe that was just me)<br />I have and will continue to buy these as gifts for her friends, family and just about anyone else. You can't go wrong with Legos!!!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I got a little confused in parts. Wish I knew what Megan and Connor did for a living since they worked a lot. Other than that, it was a pretty solid read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Tah dahhhhhh, It's Twilight :)<br /><br />Seriously......In spite of the fact that this review will be lost amongst a sea of countless other Fifty Shades reviews, here goes:<br />(Warning: My Reviews are Thorough, Sometimes Crass & To the Point....)<br />After considering the several mixed reviews & opinions I have observed from friends and the media concerning this series, I decided to read it for myself & make my own assessment. I've been dying to weigh in since I learned it was a bestseller. I'm a person who is strongly against jumping on the bandwagon & riding it just because everyone else is. I HATE FADS (Twilight, Harry Potter, Hunger Games, to name a few). I like to do my own research in order to form my own educated opinion. If I like it I like it. If I don't, I don't... In this novel's defense, you cannot fairly judge it without reading it first. Never mind the premise, fair is fair. That being said, I read it front to back. And I can honestly say that every negative review you've heard or read is truthful in some form or fashion.... Even the Youtube videos making fun of it are spot on. There are several things wrong with this novel, but I'll lay out the boldest points in black & white...............<br /><br />1) ANA'S CONFLICTING CHARACTERISTICS & PERSONALITY:  Regardless of the fact that she is in her early twenties & essentially still a child, she is unforgivingly juvenile in her habits, especially considering she's a journalism major. One would think she'd have a slightly higher level of personal etiquette & behavior with her educational background. I'm a 23 year old American woman & every other word out of my mouth isn't \\"Holy cow\\" or \\"Oh my\\". Furthermore, at the beginning of the book, she's a shy, clumsy virgin who trips over her own two feet & has never had a boyfriend. By the middle, she's a sex crazed nymphomaniac who has fallen head over heels in love with a man she's only just met. Bottom line, James should have put more thought into the character of Anastasia Steele to make her a more balanced character that ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE. Because quite frankly, I was confused...<br /><br />2) ANA & CHRISTIAN'S DIALECT and DICTION: If you begin reading this book & you do not know that the author is European English, you will by the end. The phrasing & terminology used by Christian & Ana (who narrates the novel) is clearly English, NOT AMERICAN. And this is no exaggeration. It is PAINFULLY obvious. Americans do NOT talk like them. The typical American wouldn't say \\"back at university\\". We'd say \\"college\\". We just don't talk that way. Period. I could bog this review down with quotes from the novel showing how geographically awkward it is, but I'll leave it at that. If you're going to write a novel about Americans that takes place In America, get the vernacular right. This may not have annoyed others, but it irked me to no end...<br /><br />3) JAMES' WRITING STYLE: It is in countless other negative reviews so much to the point that I'm almost tired of reading about it. But this review wouldn't be complete without it. James writes with the same gusto I wrote with when I was twelve. GOOD GRIEF!!! If I tried to count the \\"Holy cows\\", \\"Oh mys\\", & \\"Whoas\\" in this book, I'd be out of a lot of time. Thank God for the search option on Kindle. A whopping combo of 73. Really, James? The repetitiveness in this book is so annoying, you almost want to just throw the book down completely & give up. It is almost inevitable that the entire book would have been compared to Twilight by the general public. But It's almost as if it was intentional by James. The similarities are endless.  Set in Seattle. Clumsy girl & tormented guy fall head over heels in love at first site. She just can't get over how beautiful & rich he is. And mentioning it on every. Freaking. Page. Just awful. If you can find a page where they're not doing the horizontal, I guarantee you'll find her describing just how beautiful he is. So you know what, I'll give Stephanie Meyer this one. Her writing style isn't nearly this bad......<br /><br />So why did I finish the book & am a quarter through with the second installment? You could call me a glutton for punishment, but I disagree. The book has one redeeming quality & that is its storyline. It's fresh in today's literary world consisting mainly of teen vampires, English wizards, & a Lord of the Flies rip off.  Given, this series had a lot of potential that it does not live up to, I must admit. I NEED to know what happens between these two. Despite the poor writing technique & both characters' annoying habits, I am enamored by their story & am willing to look past them to get to the end of this trilogy. Do I recommend that you read this series? If you believe it is in your ability to look past the 3 gross points I mentioned then sure. Have at it. I believe that at its core, beyond the \\"holy cows\\", \\"whoas\\", and \\"oh mys\\", (and........Twilight similarities) it could have been a fabulous story.
B00973902K|5.0|Good beat.  Nice to sing along to. Can understand the words, like in the old days.<br /><br />I would recommend to friends.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is the best calculator ever in the hole world like it blows my mined I love this app so so so so so much
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|What can I say.... It was low cost, easy to install and made a noticeable improvement. It's a good product especially for the low price.
B009A87X80|5.0|Eva was a remarkable singer. If you don't have any of her cd's, this is a good place to start.  Not the 20 songs I would have picked, but i'm sure most folks would have their own different list.  Where this falls short, it doesn't have much variety. Eva was known for her versatilty & this cd is made up mostly of her best known easy-listening type ballads.  She was a great singer of different styles - blues, gospel, jazz, folk,& some rock too. Most of the best of those types aren't here. (Might there be a companion best-of in the future?)  But any cd with most of her best ballads still has to rate 5-stars.
075669812X|5.0|I bought this for my grandson's birthday and he is a big fan of Lego Ninjagos so he is very happy
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as brilliant as the first. Kept me interested the entire boom. Never knew what was coming. Can't wait to finish the trilogy.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Great protection cover for my Kindle Fire - easy to open and close - nice to hold Kindle while reading
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing love the last 15% ish of this book and seeing the other side was pretty intriguing. Totally recommend these books to everyone
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Birthday present for my finace' and he loved it. I looked everywhere for it, and finally found it on here.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game here is a awesome seed H-A-W-K-47 trust me. It gives you a unique land scape. Recommend this game.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Such a fun and addicting game!  The graphics are very smooth and cute.  Gameplay is challenging without being frustrating.  I love that there are multiple achievements for each level.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|This movie is beyond being poorly scripted, directed and produced.  A true old style B movie.  Didn't deserve the 3 Star rating.<br /><br />Could only bear to watch the first 20 minutes.
B000002L7V|5.0|this cd came in a timely manner and as described . it was a very cool addition to my cd collection . it's just to bad he passed away last summer .
B00AU15HPC|3.0|Justin's voice and playing, have been an enjoyment for too many years to admit to. The music is pleasant enough, but mainly is experimental rehashes of already done famous catches of his. The only one that left me thinking as to &#34;why did he remix this&#34;, was the one track which resembles a 70's disco funk mix of out takes that was thrown up in the air and landed wherever. Justin, you are a living hero to many. Please shake hands with Mike, Ray, John and Graeme, do one last humongous tour, and then do what you are spectacular at, which is smaller venue, live acoustic club dates.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|this was another cd I decided to get and add to my collection . it is really different from his older music for sure .
B004C0WVP6|1.0|I used to only buy Seagate drives, and at the time most came with 5 year warranty, the best in the biz.  But now most are 3 year warranty, and I have had multiple drives fail shortly after the 3 year mark.  They will not work out any kind of replacement or discount once past the warranty, so I am essentially out $150 plus for \\"top of the line\\" drives.  Based on my recent experience I am now using a competitor (Toshiba), hoping they are better.  So far their drives are quieter, and performance in line with Seagate.  The ONLY thing I still like about Seagate is their utilities for testing drives that have errors and have failed.  But I would much rather have a drive that doesn't fail, and not need to use that software.  So I guess their priorities are in the wrong place.
B000006NX5|4.0|I found a song I was looking for a very long time. The song was  love`s theme very hard to find
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This was a great movie that I felt was just as good as Lord of the Rings. Lots of action and visually exciteing and I particularly liked the music. I can't wait for the next movie to be released. I loved it!!!!!!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It combines an analytical view to an absurd probability. I found it hysterical at times and at other times a little repetitive.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Within the first chapter I was in tears.  The book was really good in the beginning...Then the middle felt a little like it was trying to explain maybe more than it needed? If that makes since.  However all in all it was a good book and I will continue to find out more about the family in the upcoming book...<br /><br />Always a Romantic xoxo
B0015ABRE2|5.0|my boyfriend and I cannot stop watching dexter. we sit down and watch an entire seaspon in one weekend. excellent
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Lovely, functional app.  Would love the ability to change the color and size of the digital display in a future update.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Great movie, A feel good movie....<br />This is a great family movie, entertaining for the whole family.<br />You won't be dissappointed.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|this was a great movie, length was great, kept me glued to screen.  Hope to rent another soon like this
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very great game it is very fun to play we play it all the time keep creating aweeome apps
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|very entertaining from the very start . Lots of action and great stunts.Daniel Craig makes a very believable Bond , will be sad to see him go.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was soo sweet and romantic, I really enjoyed how the book flowed and how emotional it was at time. I also really enjoyed the ending :)
B00AJLHTU4|1.0|I must say I'm extremely disappointed in the 2 LP reissue. It's a well engineered record even if it's got some of the stereotypical 80s mixing and bad digital reverb, but my comments are about the pressing itself. I think this was pressed by the same incompetent bunglers who did the recent The Beatles reissues. Same defects. There's loud, low frequency, out of phase noise going on all the time. It's only on the loudest passages that it's drown out. I do have the original Korean pressing that was 1 LP. Even though the cutting pitch is much narrower, it's much quieter and you can actually hear more detail even though the recording level is lower! There are some ever so slight low-end limitations, but I imagine that couldn't be helped with the narrow cutting pitch. If you can find an original Korean pressing, get that one! I would recommend the CD over this 2 LP set! Even the artwork was half-assed. As silly as it seems, I'm even a bit angry about this. Lately, I've been seeing lots of LP reissues that just suck! It's like someone is just milking the cash cow, and selling junk. It's usurping vinyl's reputation! When someone sells a product this poor, it's like they're whoring the underlying work as well as the medium itself. Stay with the CD, or find the Korean pressing if you can. I'll be keeping mine!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game play it almost every day crazy addictive and a great way to pass tIme hope you like it
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app is good. If you like horses you will like this app. It is a great app to learn how to take care of horses.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It is about as one would expect for a game of this genre. On par or better than most. Decent graphics, sound and story.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I definitely would recommend watching it. The story moves at a good pace and I appreciated the characters.
B003L20IHO|5.0|This is a movie that appeals to adults and teenagers, guys and girls. It is touching, sad, romantic, family centered- all in one package. We don't buy a lot of movies because we do red box rentals but this one is a keeper.
B001THM1J6|5.0|Even if not written by an Indian (actually, I don't know that for sure), I found this to be a really good, albeit one-sided, history lesson.  I quoted it in my own book.  It shows the heart of the battles of 150 years ago, what really caused the Indian wars (white man wanted Indian lands).  This was a good antidote, or at least balance, to books like \\"The Light and the Glory\\" by Peter Marshall.  I appreciate BOTH books, and I won't say one is right and the other is wrong.  We should read BOTH of them to come to some idea of what was really going on back then.
B008O037RG|3.0|Mumford & Sons is one of the few contemporary bands that I like. The songs on this album are exactly what you would expect from them, but if you are a vinyl enthusiast like I am, just stick with the CD on this one. With vinyl, I expected that open, dynamic, relaxed mix that breathes, but apparently whoever mastered this didn't know how to master to vinyl. It's the same compressed mix that sounds fine on an iPod when you're listening with ear buds, but on a good sound system, I could only listen to a couple of cuts before I had to switch to something else. To whoever mastered this, Shame on you! You ruined some very good music.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|What more can you ask for in a show?<br />Plot + violence + women = perfect<br />4 more words required
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|These comics got me back into comic books as a teen ager, and Im so glad they brought this to DVD.  Some stuff is new or different, but well worth it. Own both!
B000059TPN|5.0|It was exactly what we where hoping to find as far as being in good condition and something that does justice to this movie. It fits right in with our collection.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I couldn't figure out how to get it on my Kindle Fire. So I am completely unable to play the game!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This works wonderful, especially because I have a one year old who sometimes puts my phone in water..it seems flimsy when you get it but it is so durable! Would recommend this to anyone!!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The story lines are always riveting and I love the twists and turns. Well developed and believable characters.  Well done!
1936608618|4.0|A nice variety of strength work is presented. However, the notion that you can exclusively use high intensity training for events lasting longer than 2 hours is just ridiculous. The good news is that most people do not compete in events that last several hours so this system could potentially work for them.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The first book magical, thrilling. The continuation is also good, however I felt that occurring events were predictable. It is still worth to read it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The first Matrix and Animatrix are work getting this set alone, but it's nice to have the whole family together, even if two of them are s***s and cause problems. It's like a Matrix Family Reunion where the two estranged brothers come home to cause a disturbance, but in the end it's still family and you love it as a whole.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was very addictive.  Loved the characters and how they overcame his past and release him to enjoy a future.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Some of the worst makeup in any movie that I have ever seen. Joseph Gordon Levitt looks like a cross dresser who forgot to put on his high heals and mini skirt. The film moves oddly and the plot has way too many holes. It feels like a bunch of ideas all slapped together.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy was very addictive.  Loved the characters and how they overcame his past and release him to enjoy a future.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|This film stinks of Hollywood rushing the whole way through. A poorly constructed, terribly written, mess of a blockbuster. It does not hold up and shames the second film in the series. What a lazy finale. So disappointing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was very addictive.  Loved the characters and how they overcame his past and release him to enjoy a future.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|So I have been in love with Zepto Labs games since I first saw Cut the Rope. I was so excited to see Pudding Monsters! Super cute graphics, great story line, puzzle solving that kept me entertained. My nephews love it too!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Movies like this just piss me off. Great director, great actors and...nothing. A complete nothing movie. Was it about a cult? Was it about human nature? Hell if I know. I know it wasn't a drama. It wasn't a comedy. Wasn't an action flick. Just pure, boring garbage. And the singing at the end? My wife came running to see what was wrong with me I groaned so loud! I miss the guy that made Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and Magnolia. Punch-Drunk I talked myself into liking. There Will Be Blood had no magic, but was mesmerizing to watch. This movie. Ouch. And I had heard this was &#34;based&#34; on Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard. Not true. Nothing to do with that particular cult WHATSOEVER. At least that would have been interesting to watch. If I had seen this at the movies I would have walked out in the middle of it and gotten my money back for sure. Most likely before the middle of it.
B004UJAOLM|1.0|So I know that this is considered a classic book, I just assumed that meant it was supposed to be a good read. I cannot tell you how many times I just wanted to kill the main characters and be done with it. I only finished reading the book just to see if it EVER got any better. Also the writing of the local dialect of one of the characters I could not understand a single word. I hope that his converstions were not pivital to the plot point because I had to keep skipping every part in the book because I had no idea what he was saying. All I can say is Catherine needs to grow up and Heathcliff needs to get a life. Classic, yeah right!
B001QJUX24|5.0|Great movie directed by John Ford. Based on a book based on history. Event that occured in Texas in 1800's.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Pros: Affordable price, lengthy cable, very compatible with software<br />Cons (not GPS-specific): It may take a long time to acquire a fix if you're inside a closed or &#34;busy&#34; place. Acquisition time is actually rather fast once you  go outside in an open space, so it's not an unexpected con. This behavior is not unusual for any kind of GPS.<br /><br />It works great with Google Earth, and the provided utilities are also fun to experiment with (you can see a map of satellites). Make sure you grab the latest tools from the GlobalSat website, since the ones that come with the product may be outdated. It also works great on Linux and cooperates well with open-source GPS libraries.
B003XYERRM|5.0|This is a fascinating book, giving one an alternative to the more common &#34;Richard II was evil and killed his nephews&#34; line.  It's well-written and is one of the best historical fiction books I've read.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Been reading King` s stuff for years and this one doesn't disappoint.  Just real enough to be scary. Just scary enough to be real. A quick read.
B0000CF35G|5.0|This is a very nice album, it is substantial not flimsy like a lot of the other albums I have. ACDC rocks, highly recommended!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I've always liked mahjong, so when I got my kindle I knew I had to have it.  This version does not disappoint.  Good graphics and easy play. I would recommend this version to anyone who enjoys mahjong..
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good read but a little slow at first...Hoping the next two of the trilogy start out a little more faster paced!
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My eight year old loves this show! This past Christmas we took her to a R5 concert (Which features Ross Lynch and his siblings/best friend in their own band, their parents are there and active as well) and they played some of these songs. It was my daughters first concert. It was fun, wholesome and afterward she got to meet the band members and get autographs. We listen to this CD every morning on the way to school and most anytime we are in the car with her. The tunes a fun and catchy. If you have a child that loves this show as much as mine, you will have fun with this disc. They keep it very clean.
B00AHXIC50|3.0|Compared to his first album, this is so-so.  And it's a little skimpy, too.  Just 10 songs.  He'll probably come back in 8 or so months with a &#34;deluxe&#34; version with added songs.
B000KJU182|5.0|This is an excellent movie, but with a tragic ending.  It largely follows Herman Melvilles novel &#34;Billy Budd, Foretopman&#34; with the exception of the basis of Claggart's evil nature.  In Melville's novel, Claggart can be interpreted as being homosexual.  But in the movie, he is seen as a broken, lonely man.  Judge for yourself.  A highly entertaining movie.
B008BIN9EW|3.0|this game came up when I was searching for catan. Its ok, but not exactly my cup of tea. I will continue to play though, just not as much as I had thought.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Yep, she is. I was surprised. I'd have sex with her but really good movie. I am a cripple and I really connected with this movie. Not a lot of women like to have sex with crippled guys but I am glad that there are people in that profession who actually do that. Anyway, it was a really nice movie and I highly recommend it to all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive! I love it. It's great for kids and adults! Runs smooth on my kindle fire hd! Just got the Rome update can't wait to start playing!
B007REV4T8|5.0|As a life long Bond fan I can honestly say this movie is in the top 2 best of all time. Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond,the movie threw me a couple of surprises but I liked them and so have the others I have talked to that saw it. A bit slow in the middle but that is justifiable as the plot proceeds. Do not miss this one
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this British show. And, getting it on Amazon was so easy and convenient! I can watch it anywhere!
B000OIZUW6|4.0|I would recommend this book for anyone interested in WWII, especially the areas we don't often hear about, i.e.. women pilots, spies etc. And written by Ken Follett is an additional plus!
B0060MYM7O|1.0|Foremost - before you purchase this POS I urge you to see the first episode on the first disk by way of NetFlix or Amazon to confirm that which I write next.<br /><br />The costumes, dress, are good.  The sets are just \\"good\\"  Lots of close ups so you don't get a feel for any width or depth.  The directing, to the extent it exists, is good.  And the goodness stops there.<br /><br />First, the dialogue is mumbled.<br /><br />Second, the dialogue is mumbled in a Scottish or Irish brogue.<br /><br />Third, there are as many plots and subplots as there are arrows in the air in a battle.  it is like watching a tv series on steroids at the end of season 4 or 5 ... .. except you can't understand the dialogue to figure out who's doing what to whom, where, or why.<br /><br />Fourth the directing is of no moment because in each scene (a collection of usually three people) each actor delivers their one-liner twice, and then the scene switches.  No width or depth.<br /><br />Fifth, the box set includes a large map.  However, you need a magnifying glass to read the tiny tortured print.  It is like mumbling.<br />- and looses a great opportunity to convey a great deal of information.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />After having seen all the episodes modification is in order.  The worst of the episodes about which I whine is the First Episode directed by Alan Taylor.  The remaining episodes are far better in content, audibility, and continuity.  There are lapses.  The map is still garbage.<br /><br />After reconsideration, I give this four out of five stars.
B008220C56|5.0|Truly an amazing film!!! If you love period pieces, the scenery itself is enough to draw you in for hours.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very well written with enough technical information.  Well worth it.  Good thoughts on trials and tribulation and dedication to the goal.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Good story and told a part of history that I was unaware of--the French involvement in the sad treatment of the Jews in WW2. Everyone should be aware of the past history--it could happen again.How people suffered in those days--the German citizens as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't wait to see this in the theater!  The book was great, now I just want to watch it unfold!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Great story,--kept my interest throughout. Have loved all his books but this one takes one almost ot the present time in our life. Will their be another book to follow?
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|One of the best bond films in a while.  The action, plot, effects, everything was terrific.  Felt like I was bond
B007THA4FI|3.0|Too much jumping around in story--characters get confusing. It was a disappointment considering the reputation of the writer. Hopefull the next adult book will be more enticing.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Why doesn't the developer say it doesn't work with Kindle Fire?  Even Amazon said it was compatible with my KF on the purchase screen!  Well, it won't connect to my wi-fi.  Even though it's only 99 cents it's a rip-off since we've been mislead so I'm calling Amazon and complaining about this one.  And the other reviewers are right, the SALE ribbon on the icon (the only thing that does work on my KF) is an eyesore.  Edit:  Just called Amazon and got a refund.  I was told that this app won't work on the Kindle Fire unless you grant them all the permissions they want.  I won't since I feel they're too intrusive.  Come on, like they really need to see what's in my calendar in order to tell me if it's going to be sunny out today?
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Loved his life story with all the warts . He was the man of our century--so self confident and only please himself but changed the world. Who will follow in his footsteps to change the world?
B003PBB4ME|2.0|i think it's good but like stabilizer no work, i  try it and doesn't really work it is too similar to use the hands i think i am looking for something more professional
B0076DELIG|5.0|I enjoyed this character because he seemed very real. The author made me feel like I hated to put the book down and could not wait to get back to it. Also it did not have the climax and the end of the book in the same last chapter.
B00451VH84|1.0|I tried posting this once before, but was blocked by Amazon stating it could not be posted as written. I bought this DVD and found that the format given would not be able to play on my player. It would not play on a playstation 3 either. I blew 20 bucks for a product that could never be played. I will NEVER buy from this supplier again. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is an enthralling book.  I recommend it highly, especially to anyone who lived through the 1960s.  It made me feel as if I were back in time.  Stephen King's attention to detail is amazing.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|This is a great album and I can see it in my itunes library, but it wont load onto my ipod.  I usually only buy music from itunes but this was such a great deal I decided to give it a try.  If anyone has instructions as to how I can get this awesome album loaded onto my ipod I would really appreciate it.<br />j
B005723JSQ|5.0|Easy read and very good!  Loved the story line.  I hope she continues to write more books!  Love Sophie Kinsella
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Chose this for the music - loved the film and wanted the soundtrack - great songs and wonderful memories of a great film.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|So my wife has gotten started on going back seasons to see how well they hide the details needed for the future seasons and story.  It is great.  It is such a small part, but it adds so much.  Hair cut, outfit, cuts, whatever they are on today, gone tomorrow back again.  Pay attention it all comes together.  Don't and it hardly makes a difference, but for fans it really adds to the flavor.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Beautiful songs on this CD - amazingly talented cast and beautiful voices. Love the lyrics and love the movie. Wonderful
B001MM28JG|5.0|Maybe your the comic relief? This is my summary of this great sci-fi.  A must see for fans of shows with Star in the title.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is hilarious - Rebel Wilson - Aussie Aussie Aussie - OI OI OI - classic film - classic movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this for my daughter to keep her amused when she was not feeling well. She loves it as does her brother. It seems a bit mindless to me but they like it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Beautiful movie and sensitive. Loved it when I was growing up and love it now. Wonderful show. Beautiful movie. Brilliant
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I love to read books and then see the movie afterwards and this time is no exception.  It was a little slow to start but then I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best episode in a while! Love this show. Why is it so addictive?? Can't watch enough. Need more episodes per season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After seeing the movie I decided to go back and read the books! I'm so glad I did!  So many details the movie left out! Finished the first book in 3 sittings and I can't wait to start the next!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved the second season! Way more going in than the first! This was the first time i used amazon prime to watch on my TV- will be doing it a lot more!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I absolutely love Jurassic Park and really anything dinosaur related.  Game does not force you to spend real money which is a giant plus. I just wish Mr. DNA would show up in game.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|i didn't really care for this movie but i bought it for my son, since we bought a 3-D tv. and my opinion is that journey to the center of the earth is a better 3-D movie than Avatar. plus it's a sci-fi dances with wolves movie.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Continue to compete until you win all the prizes.  Enjoyable challenge which kept me occupied for hours.  Grandchildren enjoyed it also.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|the movie is what I expected from Liam neeson. I enjoy all of his films. I wish that is was longer.
B00BESM14U|4.0|The movie brings attention to several issues commonly faced by teens as well as the mental illness suffered by one of the main characters.  Ezra Miller as Patrick was great.  The other characters were really good as well.  Ezra's character really stood out in the movie.  I first saw Ezra Miller when he played Tucker on Royal Pains.  Tucker and Libby were great characters.  Wish they were still on the show.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|When I play this music, and it's played often, I put it on REPEAT, and never get tired of it. Different, refreshing and thrilling.
B009AP2G26|4.0|Season 4 is great.  The mix between McKinnley High Glee and Rachel & Kurt in New York works really well.  Glad to see alot of previous characters returning on a regular basis.  Need to bring back Finchel and Klaine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I didn't know how to play on the computer so I. Have been waiting for this app and it came thanks  mojang
B000YJ85BI|3.0|Scalia's writing skills continue to develop with each book.  I believe any science fiction fan will find this enjoyable to read.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great book.this sears is good to.i like Dog Days.theis book are funny and cool and awesome<br /><br />!?!?@$&
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I love this movie! It's my favorite of all time. When the only complaint is you don't care for Drew Berrymore's makeup, you know you're having to look for something to be wrong. Absolutely amazing movie!
0307950689|3.0|A fun thriller, but having read other Dan Brown books it feels like I've already read this one as well.  His writing style is very formulaic and predictable.  Other than that it is an enjoyable escape from reality.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This app saved me a lot of headache.  I had transferred all of my recipes (MANY!) to my tablet from our desktop and they were not readable.  I tried everything I knew to change the format, but nothing worked.  As soon as I downloaded Office Suite, I could read all of them.  Thank you for this app!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this book. I really enjoyed reading it. It is well written and easy to read.<br />The storyline was interesting and the characters very believable.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|This was very boring after a few minutes.  I thought maybe my granddaughter would enjoy playing this, but after just a few minutes, she lost interest in it.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Worked first time, right out of the box.  True plug and play.  Using on Window 7 Ultimate laptop.  What else can I say?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Once I start playing I can't seem to stop! Its very addictive and on more than one occasion I have looked at the clock and realized that I've been playing for hours!!!! I would totally recommend this game to anyone who likes card games
B008KYOCA2|5.0|The best appointment app on Amazon! Highly recommend this to anyone with a busy schedule. Even has little icons and you can purchase extras!
B004DNWPY4|5.0|I first read this book many years ago and have since been giving it away to my clients. Modelling others is a time proven way to achieve the results they achieve. This is no different for wealth creation. This book provides some clear keys to reaching financial success and maintaining it. It also provides invaluable lesions for bring up financially and emotionally independent children.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the game played well on my kindle but you have to purchase the game to finish. haven't done so yet
B00422LESO|2.0|I think that the concept of Austenland is a great plot and this book started out OK. However, after getting to Austenland, it really went downhill pretty fast. The situations definitely were too forced. The protagonist was forgettable, the men even more forgettable, and the comedy fell flat. I think this plot would work better as a film rather than a book, so I'm still interested to see the film version. But if you want to try this book, spend as little money as possible because it's likely to make you mad if you spend more than $3 just to be disappointed.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|So, why not a 5? If I was only interested in being entertained, than a &#34;5&#34; it would have been. However, I also was interested in what really happened and here Hollywood formulas surely trumped reality, e.g., the lone hero with a troubled marriage, defying the bureaucrats, the last minute chase, etc. Nonetheless, would I recommend seeing it, absolutely!
0140177191|5.0|I just recently read this book, and I could not believe it was not one of the books I was reading in high school. Everyone is familiar with the King Arthur books, but reading a version of the Legend from the women's perspective brings it to a whole new level. I was especially drawn to the women's struggle to living in a man's world and the shift from pagan worship to Christianity. The change in perspective to the women's point of view brings more relevance to the story. This book is about power and the struggle of the heart and soul.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have only seen a few episodes so far from Season 3, but I am catching up quickly. So far it has been awesome and it keeps me wanting more!!!!!
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|The blu-ray quality is amazing. This movie is amazing. If you like psychological character dramas, you will like this movie. Michael Shannon should have been nominated for best actor last year. This is the most under rated performance of the year.
B0022CY8WK|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing, I LOVE Chicago. I completely recommend it! You should buy this, it really is extremely awesome.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This is a great game as long as your screen is not highly reflective.  Some object I found when my finger accidentally touched the screen, others were difficult to tap.
B006LQQ1GE|2.0|Aside from being a CD with only 1 really good song, even that song has extremely poor sound quality. I haven't heard hiss like that in over 20 years. Do yourself a favor and buy the single song on mp3 and save the money. IMO ,State of the Art was ok as was Eyes Wide Open but not what I would say good. His music is all over the place. Very disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is as good game good the world tours  to!!!! It is fun  I always play it and  every one is talking about it
B003YCI1O8|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I viewed it.<br />Great cast, music, dialog(lots of humor) and a killer location.<br />Watching it on Blu-Ray was a real treat.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|The book may be weird butt it's fun to look words I've never even heard of oh us my real name is Angelo well that's all I have to say
B003XF1OJK|5.0|The story starts out great and just keeps better. Follow the adventures of the Master chief as he starts out from a kid to the ultimate killing machine and Demon to the covenant
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Nice app. It delivers what it promises.<br /><br />Can see all pics. And converts nicely from .mpv to any format.<br /><br />Thansk
1419701533|5.0|Come on, who doesn't love the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books? As a grown man I made it a point to buy and read these all and I thoroughly enjoyed them. I'm sure my kid will too when he learns to read. Don't forget to buy the ones released after this box set as well. A collection deserves to be complete.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This man had a goal and gave everything and nearly his life to stop slavery.  Highly recommend as a bit of British history.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Ordered the entire set of these and they are all amazing. I was shocked to find such nice replicas at such a low cost. I recommend the purchase to all Trekkies.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|I bought this as a gift but the person who received it really likes R. Downey.  He says it is very well acted.
B001O1O71C|5.0|If you have watched the movie then I highly recommend reading the book. I'm not exactly sure what the movie was going for but the story is supposed to take place at Auschwitz. If you found yourself wondering about that while watching the movie then the book will probably explain much more you were wondering about as well. Great book, great purchase.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Had this on my Kindle for my granddaughter but she was so good and had so much stuff on it my Kindle couldn't handle all the space (memory) so had to get her her own Kindle and get it off mine.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|So many of my friends insisted DA was one of the best TV series ever made, and still I resisted watching it for almost two years.  Then I received an iPad for Christmas, caught a bad cold, and decided to stream the 1st episode while recuperating in bed...I couldn't stop streaming...and streaming...Afterwards I knew I had to get my family to start watching it so I bought the DVDs.  We are all hooked!  I bought Season 3 even before the PBS broadcasting in the US was over.  We've watched all 3 seasons more than twice, and we can't wait for Season 4 to start in October, 2013!!!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Very interesting story.  Tells the tale of things that happen in lives of those who have been around a while like death in the family, physical, marital problems.  I enjoyed it very much.  Already have watched it twice since getting it about a week ago.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game.  My young nephew also enjoys playing this game.<br />  It is easy to play and doesn't require a lot of time.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I resisted this game for a long time as something too frivolous to be worthwhile. Then a friend convinced me to try it, and after downloading, I couldn't quit, especially when my friend said she always tries to score three stars. After a few weeks of near compulsive play, I finally quit cold turkey. I will probably start playing after I retire in about a month.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Colorful and addictive. So many levels it goes on and on. Great fun! Ads are not intrusive in the free version and they offer other games like it that I will be sure to try.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|The alarm clock does not work at all. If I could have given a zero star I would have. I was excited but after waiting for it to wok for 4 days I gave up.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|For all those Shamless fans, this girl can really sing.  Try the samples to hear her voice.  I loved some of the oldies she brings back in her own style.  Well worth the money for this easy listening CD.
B003IDMUVI|5.0|Enough sub-plots to keep me glued and loved the ending. Grisham remains an easy read that maintains your interest throughout.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|As usual, he was terrific in a role that fit him to a tee.  This film was not too long and had very good Southern scenery.  I would recommend seeing it especially with Amazon Prime's free rental.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I purchased this movie for 2 reasons. 1. Amazon had a really good buy for the 2 disc collectors edition 2. Everybody I asked said the movie was very good. After watching the film, I felt inspired in a way. Jesse Eisenberg portrays Mark Zuckerberg and I have to say, the acting was done very well. I believe what really gets me about this movie is its based off a true story obviously about the every so popular Facebook, but watching it, you see the company unfold and the headache which made this movie before it was mainstream. Also, Andrew Garfield gave a fine performance, wasn't expecting him to be as bold and moving at times as his character portrayed. Definitely a good watch, I would recommend this to just about everyone!
B005FDXT32|5.0|There's nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said a thousand times before. Scarface stands out not only as one of the top movies in its genre, but one of best movies of all time.
B009NCM248|3.0|One of my all-time favorite bands......A little bit softer than their other albums....but overall.....I like it<br />I'm hooked on absolute zero
B00AU15HPC|4.0|A lot of folks have been waiting for this new CD from Justin Hayward for quite some time now and with a fan base that has been built around the tours of The Moody Blues over the past few decades it isn't easy to be critical of the rights and wrongs of the new disc because for over forty years now there has been a bit of 'worship' surrounding the music of the Moodies and with John Lodge and Justin standing that front line on the stages of the world you have a band with two leading men in it that has a fanbase any boy band is (at least) really jealous of.<br /><br />Justin, has been the hitmaker since the begining and \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" \\"Question\\" and \\"Nights In White Satin\\" are part of the pop culture that will be with us always. The magic is HUGE and it based on three things: (1.) Justin's writing (2.) his voice, and (3.) his guitar. Those three elements are stamped into us. Moody Blues music and solo works from Justin Hayward are separate beings but they are big spoonfuls from the same stewpot as there are those songs, that voice and those guitars found in both outlets to the man's wonderful art.<br /><br />Over 16 years after \\"The View From The Hill\\" we arrive at \\"Spirits of the Western Sky\\" and there is good treasure to be found here. With: \\"In Your Blue Eyes\\" \\"One Day, Someday\\" \\"The Western Sky\\" \\"The Eastern Sun\\" & \\"On The Road To Love\\" being five of Justin's best songs that are presented in the proper manner (these are not over-produced) and Justin's acoustic guitar sets the tone of what is found here. Justin's voice is as great and mighty as it was in 1969 and for a man of rock music to protect his voice and write as sharp and clear as he did on: \\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\" it does lead you to believe that there are indeed 'higher' forces at work here protecting our hero as this music is about ten times better than anything else being released in 2013.<br /><br />\\"Lazy Afternoon\\" and \\"In The Begining\\" are decent tracks but after the first five selections of \\"Western Sky\\" they sound almost like secondary music or b-sides suited to Justin's next single. The \\"bluegrass\\" songs from \\"Moody Bluegrass\\" are outta place on this CD and are here as a marketing ploy to sell a few more of those two discs that do not have anything to do with this latest project from Justin. Of the three \\"bluegrass\\" selections (and a dorbo don't make this music bluegrass by any means!) \\"Broken Dreams\\" (from \\"View From The Hill\\") holds up as a great song you cannot destroy with any arrangement. Will Justin Hayward jump into the dirty pond that is today's so-called 'country' music? I sure do hope not!<br /><br />\\"Captivated By You\\" and an extended version of \\"One Day, Someday\\" are the last tracks of the new music of this CD and then a short (23 second) link track takes us across the bridge to the Eurodisco for two dance-mixes of \\"Out There Somewhere\\" that will be not of much interest to the over-sixty bunch of Justin fans out there that are getting ready for their next hip surgery and not found in nasty alleys at 4 AM trying to score some meth.<br /><br />Some of the greatest music of Justin's 50 year career can be found here but (at best) we have half of a new album that has been padded with other things that really don't relate to where the man is headed towards today. I could have waited another few years for the next batch of new songs that would have made this the finest Justin Hayward album of the bunch. But, the Moody Blues cannot get a record deal and Justin needs to purchase another villa in the south of France. Justin, is the best thing in pop music and in 15 years we will be listening to his best record. He is still just getting started.<br />Four Stars!ections of \\"Western Sky\\" they sound almost like secondary music or b-sides suited to Justin's next single.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this program.  The characters are first rate and loveable.  My favorite character is Isobel.  I can't wait for the fourth season to start.  I will purchase that series as well.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|The law and crafty lawyers take centre stage again. This is quite different from earlier novels and, I suspect, written very tongue in cheek. Clever twists make the story that bit different. Having read virtually everything that Grisham, I loved this one, and it made me smile a lot!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun!  Enjoy figuring the harder ones out. Will keep your mind busy for hours. Can be addicting, be careful!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great! It is a lesson in standards that should be a model for all writers for tv programs to achieve.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its a great game and i do recommend it but it worked for about 3 weeis and it dosent let me open it or redownload  anymore.....
0375842209|4.0|Bought it for my son's 8th grade reading, I don't really know if it is a good read.  He wasn't thrilled with it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|WOW... best book on running EVER.. not a boring &#34;how to book&#34; but a true book that reads like a novel, motivates like no other, and teaches at the same time.  I would suggest this for runners, history buffs and anyone trying to get motivated to either get off the couch and do their first 5K or run their first 200Mile ultra!!!
B00849F82E|5.0|Chesterton is profound, deeply insightful, must be read more than once to fully grasp the depth of truth & wisdom!
B009RH9J7W|4.0|This leather case works well. I've had it for about 5 weeks now. It does need a little tweaking with the way it stands up as it doesn't fit that well. The notches seem to slip out and collapse occasionally. I do like how when I open the case the unit comes right on. Nice! Quality seems fine but time will tell. If I can get a good year or two out of it I'll be happy. Don't shy away from this one, I've seen cheaper out there.
0307719774|5.0|I had to have this when I saw it on modcloth.com, but I didn't like the price they were asking for it. So I checked it out on good ol' Amazon and I found it much cheaper! This book is a really cool idea for those who just can't keep a journal and it could be a great gift for someone as well. Love it!
B004UJ6YNO|5.0|This album has some amazing lyrics if you are into songs that are uplifting, I would recommend this album for review.
B001U3ZMHW|5.0|He loved it, all the pieces were there, nothing broken and he played with it. What more could you ask for from a toy.
B00340LM8C|2.0|The Plot was Ok and the scenery was very nice but the movie just dragged along. It was a disappointment
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It is a cool game and all but I think it is way to short. I like it just as much as minecraft pocket edition and xbox 360 edition.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|All my students were playing this game during my class and now I know why. So much more interesting than my lessons. And such better way to get to college.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this calculator app is the first i've tried but like very well.  it actually uses the whole kindle screen making it very good even if someone has some sight problems with small print.  it also seems to be very capable for doing large calculations which can span more then 10 digits.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Like others here, I bought this to upgrade my Synology diskstation and it worked out perfectly! The diskstation has been operating for a few months with this upgrade and all functions are normal!
B0062OCNAI|2.0|Slow and or<br />PREDICTABLE.  Didn't like story.  Didn't keep me entertained didn't keep my attention I would not recommend this book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great actors. Great stories. Great writing. Great sets. Great Costumes. And the most stunning colors and textures I've ever seen on screen. Wonderful to watch and enjoy!
B00A12VJZM|5.0|Does this album really require a review? Everyone knows the Stones rock man! Rock man! Rock man! Rock man! OK... finally, got to the word requirement.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an awesome app! Works perfect, easy to use, self explanatory, and addicting. 100% recommended! A must have for anyone who loves anything.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I have spent a lot of time playing different versions of this game... it is a time killer while waiting or watching TV (Commercials) ... this game has several things going for it. First the control of the ball being shot is spot on! There are no surprises when you take the shot... this keeps it fun instead of frustrating... it has some special balls that are self explanatory... for first time users they have to drop to work... the best feature of all... you can save your game for later!!!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love it! This is what I've been waiting for! Something to cool down, hype you up, and sex you up! I'm a sold fan!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Some was predictable and some was surprising. Collins is a good story teller, however, and provided a great climax to the tale.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Are you kidding me? You don't already own this movie series.  Owning the Godfather is a prerequisite for true cinema appreciation 201. So many reasons why you must have this series( sans Part 3).  The quotes, the acting, the symbolism, the metaphors, the camera angles,the stories, the evolution and most importantly the canoli!  One of the best movies ever made period.  Go to the mattresses and get this movie already.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|My husband purchased this case for me when he bought my Kindle Fire HD for this past Christmas. I have no issues with this case. I have read reviews that address the sleep/wake function and I do not find it an issue. To be completely honest, I didn't even know the case had a sleep function until I read other reviews. I prefer to have my Kindle Fire HD with the ports out so I can charge it with the case closed. This also puts the power and volume buttons at the top, which I also prefer. The Kindle Fire HD easily snaps in and out of the plastic mounts and feels very secure. Another reason I define this case as 'excellent' is the elastic strap. I have ooh'd and ahh'd over some other covers but ultimately decided against them because there is no strap to secure the cover. One such cover is the Verso Prologue Antique Tan case. Lovely case but no strap to keep the cover closed. If my handbag collection is any indication of my future behavior, my Kindle Fire HD cover collection will grow as time passes. But as with my handbags, there are certain stock features a cover will have to have. The Marware Vibe in red is a great start!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|A book which you can hardly put down once you start.  All of the symbology and history is always so fascinating in his books.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|A wonderful story that will appeal to all readers. Kate Morton is a treasure and The Forgotten Garden is my favourite of her novels.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I really like this new case for my Kindle HD.  Figured it out after a few uses.  I like that u can use it in both positions.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas present for my Wife's new kindle paperwhite. It fits it well (Not too snug) and you can put the kindle in upside down and have access to the charging port with the zipper still 80% closed. Nice padding ofr the device without being bulky. Simply a good deal for the price.
0307730697|5.0|This book is very inspiring.  The story shows how a man went to the bottom & rebounded.  I bought this book for a relative who is at at very low point ...hope it helps!!!  I recomend this book to strangers I meet.
0553801473|2.0|The first three books were page turners and I enjoyed most of the fourth installment.  Unfortunately, ADWD is somewhat of a bore.  The details and numerous characters are fine, but the story is told from too many perspectives which waters down the storytelling.  Early in the series, the original characters were so well-crafted, so real that they really became alive and got under my skin.  By this fifth book, it seems more like an accounting of everything rather than a story.  Nothing really happens.  I can honestly say, it wouldn't have taken away much to simply read a synopsis and skip this book altogether.  Martin needs to consider how frustrating this is to those who've read and enjoyed the first books since who else would buy the fifth?
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Amazing book! I recommend this to anyone who wishes to read it! It is great for people that enjoy adventure and action in a book!!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Been a fan for years and this proves they still got it going on. Great mix! A fan forever and looking for the next one out!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it has a wonderful way of keeping you interested and also talks about everything that a teen in high school encounters and can experience
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I bought two - one for myself and one for my husband. We both love them. This stylus has a solid feel and nice texture. I love that it has three different size tips. I don't always need a thin tip, but it is great to have one when I do need it.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Great movie, however I haven't recieved the BR disc copy yet, but was a good movie. With lots of action and adventure with a little suspense in there to.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best App I have ever had. U can read the whole Bible or just certain verses. You can have bookmarks on any verse or your favorite verses. Also you can read it to yourself or there is a narrator that will read it to u. Please get this App it will be the greatest decision you ever made. U will really love The Holy Bible.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|While &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; initially attracted me to Macklemore+Ryan Lewis, I'm glad I took the time to listed to their other material. This is a great hip hop album that makes the perfect musical backdrop for just about any occasion. I highly recommend listening to, and purchasing, this great album.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a fun game to play and challenges your intelligence.....would recommend the game to friends and family as well
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story, great cast.  I didn't know this is the way people used to live.  How things have changed since that time period.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was recently sick and couldn't do a whole lot, so I started watching the series that I heard so much about. I was immediately hooked and watched season one on Netflix and then was very happy to find season two free for Prime members on Amazon! I was fortunate enough to catch season three on PBS online. I watched the entire three seasons in about a week! It was the only thing that got me through...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an outstanding group of actors!  Really enjoyed watching this series, and hopefully I will be watching the next series when it airs.
B009JBZH54|5.0|For a little over 30 bucks, this is as good as it gets. Nolan's masterpiece is a must have.This is the hero movie to beat.
B002QNBRXS|4.0|Dexter's writers continue to explore Dexter's psyche as he struggles to balance a life in 'the real world' with his darkness. Surprising, entertaining - it' rains on our too see list!
B0061S073A|4.0|very happy that I found this app I like being able to hand my kindle to my son. although I wish I could select books and music too.<br />e
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I just started watching Downton Abbey and it is fantastic.  The characters have such depth and the writing is phenomenal.  We will sit for hours and watch through episode after episode.  It is a wonderful show, and I can’t wait to get started on season 3.  I have no idea what I would compare it to because I have never seen anything quite like it.
B005H9B44A|5.0|The kids and I watch this all the time. It's so much fun. We have Odin Allfather's &#34;Cast You Out&#34; speech memorized. Can't wait for the next Thor that comes out this November (2013). Looks like it'll have the same great cast!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I remember watching The Breakfast Club when it was first released. I recently purchased it so that my teenage children could watch it, and they loved it as much as I did.  The lessons are timeless, although my perspective is a little different now that I'm a parent.  Very insightful!!
B002DOSBMK|5.0|This book is every thing you need if you are a d and d player or just like fantasy.  :)
B000063JZQ|5.0|I love this film, it's definitely NOT for everyone, but if you love horror, Shakespeare, moody/scary lighting, and murder this is for you. The opening scene alone with the three witches on the beach haunts my dreams to this day. Now, this is not a faithful adaptation of Shakespeare's play, so don't go watching this instead of reading the book for homework, read the play first, learn to love it, then watch this and marvel. Or don't read it and just watch it anyway! This is a rich and very dark film that is worth a viewing.<br /><br />Also, trivia moment, this was the first film Polanski made after his wife Sharon Tate was murdered...and you can tell. The despair and darkness throughout is haunting.
B006RBZV82|5.0|This a very good film, very enjoyable.  Interesting, informative and so real...just like being under the sea!  Good for the whole family! I thought it was very well done!
B00A89ITZG|4.0|Power, Speed, Endurance is good. I appreciate the deep maintenance, preventative measures, and excellent training guides that it offers. My only complaint is that with the Kindle edition there is a lot of 'grayed' out material. this is frustrating because it leaves the reader curious as to why it was left in to begin with, if it is in the more expensive paper version but not the kindle, am i getting my moneys worth, or is redundant and just being edited out. Regardless of the reason, it shouldn't be there, or final editions should be better prepared.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game I think I ever played. And I think I'll keep playing My Horse for a long long time
0062213423|4.0|This is a well organized book of mini-biographies.  I purchased it for a ten-year old, but after reading, decided not to give it to here, the book is more suited for 13 & up, only because some of the material is more &#34;teen&#34;, rather than &#34;tween&#34; oriented.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Have not read any Tom Clancy novels that I would not rate high and there are not any that I have not read.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked 50 shades, you will love the crossfire series!! I think they are better than 50 shades!! Great story, intense, both have troubled pasts. I have read both books twice, and will read them again before the third one comes out in June 2013. I am dying to get my hands on that last book!!!  I am telling you...READ THIS BOOK!!! You will not be disappointed!!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|This is the kind of music they don't make anymore.  Blue Sky Riders have an amazing combination of songwriting and performing talent that is rare these days. This is the kind of music that crosses generational and stylistic lines because it is just great, timeless, joyous and soulful music. Songs like \\"Dream\\", \\"Little Victories\\" and \\"I'm a Rider\\" are among the most wonderful songs I've ever heard. With a rare combination of purposefulness and wonderfulness, this band is the real deal. This album is up there with the best Eagles' albums when it comes to songs you love to hear, make you smile and happy to be alive.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Had me hooked from the begenning, and just kept getting better. Romance, drama, violence, suspence. Not your typical Sparks novel. I can't say enough about this book. READ IT!!!!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I was not very impressed when I saw the trailer for Silver Linings Playbook. The film seemed to be more of a quirky romantic comedy with not a lot of substance. My initial opinion changed when I saw the film.  What changed my mind were the very strong performances.<br /><br />There was an immediate connection with Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), recently diagnosed as a bipolar person, who has lost everything (his house, his job and his wife) been in a state institution for eight months and is now living with his parents (magnificently played by Jacki Weaver and Robert DeNiro).  Pat, however, is optimistic, looking for a silver lining to his problems, that he can rebuild his life and reunite with his wife, in spite of her infidelity that sparked everything.  Pat’s father only wants him to share his obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles.<br /><br />The turning point for Pat comes when he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who also has had her share of life changing problems.  Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife but he must do something for her in return – enter a dance competition.  It is a joy to watch as Pat and Tiffany begin to trust each other and slowly fall in love. The film is an honest portrayal of mental illness with very strong performances by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. One only has to watch the scene when the couple goes out to dinner for the first time to gauge the excellence of their performances.  The goal of acting is to convince the audience that you are not watching a performance.  The actors are their characters down to every detail.  The excellent screenplay delivers on the dark and comic moments with dialogue that is true to life. The scenes with the ballroom dancing are superbly acted and fun to watch.  Silver Linings Playbook is an honest look at loss and starting over again.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A real trashing of the realm, and more to come! Started watching the show on HBO and when the season ended I could not stop....  Huge books with so much going on, great ride!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|And I thought MY childhood was bad!  This is definately NOT light reading.  This book asks (and pretty much answers) the question: &#34;What happens when someone comes to the end of their rope?&#34;  I'm looking forward (sort of) to reading the next book in the trilogy.
B003VANOFY|2.0|So these sound GREAT...  I'm using them in a noisy office to make phone calls and they do a great job of cutting out back ground noise (its usually a dull roar here) and the phone/music sounds great...  What sucks is that if there is anything else wifi operating on 2.4ghz (so like any wireless router, wireless keyboard or mouse, etc), these headphones will sporadically cut out.  Worse, it's a known issue for Logitech and if you look at the Logitech forums, you'll see that the problem is being completely ignored : (
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books draw the reader in and you can't put them down until you are done. A fun read from start to finish.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|Great tale of big-wave phenom Jay Moriarity and his mentor Frosty. Storywise it's basically a bit of a mix between North Shore and The Karate Kid but a bit more realistic since, well, most of this stuff incredibly really happened shortly after the spotlight for big-wave surfing had turned from Waimea Bay and Todos Santos up to Mavericks. Like most Hollywood surf movies it has its share of necessary cheese here and there to drive the story along, but overall it's a film as solid as the surf it depicts that surfers and non-surfers can enjoy and be moved and inspired by. The soundtrack is perfect for that moment in surf history (Sponge, Mazzy Star, Butthole Surfers, The Offspring, Matthew Sweet), and the cameos by big-wave chargers like Peter Mel and Greg Long provide the necessary credibility and access for the project. Also just figured out Frosty's wife is played by Abigail Spencer watching Jimmy Kimmel whose brother is Sterling Spencer (just featured in Surfer Magazine) of the Spencer family which is Gulf Coast surf royalty (Yancy Spencer III, Yancy Spencer IV, founders of Innerlight Surf Shop - most surfers will likely recognize these names). Lots of great special features on the Blu-ray. Not sure which was harder, the surfing, or operating the many types of camera rigs used?! Really a great film worthy of any surfer's collection. LIVE LIKE JAY!
B0070XFNDE|4.0|Beautifully written, as always with Zaf&oacute;n. I appreciated the bridge between The Shadow of the Wind and The Angels Game, though this story feels less complete than either of those did--perhaps its the deliberate opening for another sequel at the end, which neither of the other books in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books had, at least to my recollection.<br /><br />Still, even if it doesn't quite feel complete, it is worth reading for Zaf&oacute;n's prose alone.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The Marware Vibe Standing Case is a must have. The Marware vibe standing case is a good quality product.  I like that the stand folds to provide a bottom support fold.  The case/stand’s best features are that it protects your Kindle and that it turns your Kindle on and off when you open and close the case.  I never have to press my power on/off button ever again as long as I use my Marware vibe standing case.  The case is less expensive than other brands and cases I have seen.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app is wonderful.I can let my toddler use my kindle with no worries of random stuff being bought.love it!
B009JZSFUY|4.0|As a devote Sci-Fi fan I enjoyed Star Trek VIII: First Contact very much.  The ever present battle between good and evil donates the plot of the movie.  As the battle ragged the conflict inevitably become raw.  The merge of present and past characters existing simultaneously was intriguing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved this show, have watched every episode of all three seasons, cant wait for season 4 even though Mathew is no longer in it...
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It isn't even cool as for all the other apps for youtube. From twihard 106 p.s. I'm 17 take my advice and you'll see try to download it
B0013D6LEM|5.0|This album has a lot of great MJ tracks! Good quality, and I love that I can save everything to the cloud!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Once you pick it up it will be a struggle to set it down.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Just received this nifty transmitter at my Front Door today.<br />Was able to quickly connect it to my Ipod Nano (6th gen.) and my Bluetooth ear-buds(Jaybirds),<br />with help from instruction manual that came with it.<br />Went for a 2.5 mile run, and sound was just as good as a wired headphone connection.<br />Connection did cut out for about 2-3 seconds on one part of my run, but that's expected with any Bluetooth device.<br />It's wasn't significant enough for me to even consider returning the Kokkia 10s Transmitter.<br /><br />The transmitter did use up some of my Nano battery power, but my run was so short-it didn't make a difference.<br />I do recommend completely charging your Nano for longer runs-just so you can listen your tunes the entire time.<br /><br />I recommend this product for any one that participates in physical activities and wants to go wireless,<br />e.g.-running,walking,jogging, Gym activities, etc.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Kind of a dark season but you'll enjoy it if you like the series.  I ready for next season now.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I love this film. It was my first look into gmo food and how food was so extremely processed. I'm so glad it covered Monsanto and how that corporation has ruined many farmers lives. It is a must for anyone who eats.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Grate show and it was fast streaming, its hard to say there are any cons about it, worth the buy for shure.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|If queen was still making music they might sound like this. Not a bad song on this cd. Totally worth buying.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I have to log into facebook, but i don't have an account. I wish I did. too bad<br /><br />+delete app+
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I don't like that I can't Transfer my apps to my desk top kindle, Please do that I paid for them. so why not. I don't have my kindle<br />it was to difficult to hold in my hands I have severe arthritis and am 77<br /><br />Jeanne Seymour
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is one of the best of the genre. Fun and challenging, it will test your patience also, so take a vallium.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Anything Pinterest is Awesome! I am glad this app came out so I can enjoy my pinterest on any of my devices.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Very eye opening. This video will help in changing our lives.<br />We will be changing our eating habits.<br />Did not realize how animals were treated. So sad.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Very interesting though first half, devolves into gossipy, product/marketing anecdotes in the second half. Worth the first half but skim, or skip, the second half. All the traits, quirks and genious of Jobs are explained and highlighted by the time he comes back to Apple. The rest just continually reinforces the traits, quirks and genious for hundreds of pages without reveling much anyone who has help an Apple product didn't know.. The author is much too close to his subject.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book takes constant sharp turns and even ends different than you think; I feel like I need a cigarette after it. Ha!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|i really enjoy this one.  trying to beat the clock is a challenge and sometimes nerve racking.  can't put it down.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|Really a disappointment and a disservice to the police & FBI. Both are portrayed as stupid, bumbling incompotents who get themselves and everyone else killed. Sad really; because the cast is pretty good.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Wonderfully smart spoof of campy older movies.  If you like those types of things I think you'll really enjoy the movie.
B006FK7SZ4|3.0|The features on this social chat site are almost limitless.  Definitely beats zoosk as far as features are concerned, making it possible to befriend the unknown.
B004UXY5D6|5.0|I will attempt to explain the epicness of this CD with the following analogy:  It's better than having a threesome with two smoking hot honies -- say Kate Upton and Kate Beckinsale (as you only need to remember one name) -- all the while Stevie Ray Vaughan, the Allman Brothers, and Lynyrd Skynrd are having a jam session cheering you on.
B00B8BR1YS|1.0|I don't hate the movie , i Don't understand it. Can we have the movie in english? What language is that?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Book was hard to det into. Very Slow beginning that never interested my taste. I paid $9.99 and really thought is was a waste. I still have note finished the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was a little worried picking this book up after seeing the previews for the movie.  I like to go into a book blind and create my own characters.  But the book was absolutely fantastic, moving, and just a pure and solid romance.  I enjoyed it a lot, and can't wait to see the movie.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is so good it so amazing! Need to read this book! Totally awesome my suggestion for a great book!
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|My friend has btd5 on his ipad and he has sandbox mode ! But not on kindle fire. Next update should be that
B0027MJU00|2.0|Loved the writing, hate the story. This is my second book by Gillian Flynn, I enjoyed the reading, except for the parts where story slowed down significantly, it had it's touching moments, but overall, very dark read
B00004YA0T|5.0|To avoid confusion, be aware that this Amazon product page is incorrectly mixing together reviews of two completely different sets of recordings on two different labels by two different conductors. Some reviews are for this EMI set of Jochum Bruckner symphonies, but others are for the Georg Tintner Bruckner symphonies on the Naxos label.<br /><br />(This is as of Feb 28, 2013. I looked around to try to figure out a way to report this to Amazon, but couldn't see an appropriate link.)<br /><br />Anyway, having said that, I will say that these Jochum recordings with the Staatskapelle Dresden are my very favorite recordings of the Bruckner symphonies. I have the reissue of them on the Brilliant label which also includes an excellent recording of the No. 0 by Stanislaw Skrowaczewski and Saarbrucken Radio Symphony. Jochum's way with Bruckner has a sweep, power, and \\"rightness\\" to it that, to my mind, beats out even the famous von Karajan recordings. The sound quality is superb (at least on the Brilliant recordings; I assume the sound would be pretty much the same here on EMI.)<br /><br />I understand that Tintner's recordings on Naxos are very fine, also, but those reviews should be on the appropriate page.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great acting and storyline.  Recommended!!!!!<br />Sound and picture quality are good.<br />Makes me want to go to United Kingdom and visit where filming took place.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very difficult to reas since learning about his recent death. Rough language - sometimes not necessary.  Have a great respect for Chris and how he served our country
B0071LLHGC|5.0|Growing up in NC in the 70's, many of us, including myself, had Fillmore East and Eat a Peach. I listened to them some but honestly I never got it the way I did with many other popular bands back then. Now I am 53 and listening to this amazing disc, \\"I get it !\\" I see what all the fuss is about. The fidelity on this recording is quite good and the mix is very different than the Fillmore East set. On this set, the guitars are a little more up front and at times close to being in your face; a personal preference. There also is a very distinct separation between each guitar; one on the left channel and one on the right. Whereas on the Fillmore set, there is some bleeding occurring. The only thing this set is missing is to have Whipping Post or Dreams. If you are a fan of classic blues rock guitar then this set is a must have.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book.  The author's style of writing had me emotionally invested by the end of the first chapter.  Advice to future readers: you will need a box of tissue nearby for the sad parts, but the humor makes up for that.  This one is definitely on my favorites list now.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as riveting as the previous two, but did end in a good way.<br />Have to read to find out the ending.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Well-constructed narrative. Good collage of original footage, dramatized footage, and current interviews. It built suspense well and was fascinating to see into the mind of this man and the people who helped him, as well as the huge undertaking it was to set this up.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good sequeal to the first book. Makes you want to read the final book to find out what happens. Good trilogy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best app in the history of apps!!!!! You don't need Internet pick. ur own characters that fit ur personality its amazing!!!!!!!!! Totally recomended
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love this cd. All of Adele's music is great. This cd has a good beat and rythmn on the songs.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this for my 26 year old son for Valentine's day. I am now the most popular mother on the planet! He has been a huge fan of Zelda from the very first and this is a definitive resource for questions about all things Hyrule.
B004XZR63M|4.0|A ton of great ideas that give you another perspective on money and its usefulness when managed correctly. Really good advice in simple and understanble scenarios.
B000002PCS|5.0|I LOVE this soundtrack. I first bought it years ago on cassette and used it as naptime music in my classroom. Eventually the tape wore out and I have never been able to find the CD. This music just makes you feel peaceful and never grows old! You will not be sorry if you choose this CD.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Very good read.  This book contains a huge amount of information about a variety of subjects. Some of which I was not familiar. However, this  did not spoil the enjoyment and excitement of this book. It became a little wordy at times. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to a new release.
B001N26GFC|5.0|Sheer happy-inducing fun. What a great film. Sally Hawkins should have been nominated for an oscar. I totally recommend it.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|If you are a Zeppelin fan, no words needed, excellent. Quality of live recording is very clear, nice to hear some songs that aren't live on any other albums.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Im love this game !  It keeps me busy all through school and never gets boring and is not hours long game! I love that you can set the color and design or even customize the cards with you own pictures! But i do wish they had levels of difficult!
B006LRUVUA|5.0|It's hard to best this one. Quick and easy remote support with all the features. Perfect for the administrator on the go.
0375851569|5.0|What can I say?  I grew up with Dr. Seuss and wanted my kids to experience his magical, rhyming world too.  I have a bunch of the beginner board books and thought it was time to start building their collection of regular Dr. Seuss books.  This was a great start.  It has the original Cat in the Hat, which is my 21 month old's favorite.  He kept pointing to it out of all of them and squealing with excitement when asked if he wanted that one.  The other four books are all popular options, including my favorite, Green Eggs and Ham.  The quality seems fine to me.  While you can see through the pages a bit, I probably wouldn't have even noticed it had I not seen it in some of the reviews here.  If it is a problem for you, however, know that it is noticeable.  For the price though, I'm happy with them.  And even more importantly, my kids seem happy with them.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I'm still learning how to get the most out of evernote, but so far I love having my notes sync across my kindle and my laptop. I'm using it to jot down to do lists, business ideas, and ideas for my youtube channel. Its always at my finger tips regardless of device.
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle's unfortunate, tragic death has taken a true American patriot from us. His book is so honest, and so much more than a riveting story about the kill record, although the gun nomenclatures, etc. and his training as the best sniper in military history is all there. But it is also a story about a man and his family, and his wife's observations, liberally sprinkled throughout the book add a lot to i. A great book for anyone who loves America and the men who sacrifice so much to keep us free.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|A good, solid dual-core Intel processor. I bought this for my daughter's PC - she doesn't do any truly heavy PC gaming, so this CPU with a good video card will be more than enough for her. It's very quick, and I'm sure she'll be happy when she gets it!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|i bought this movie for my daughter for valentine's day, she loves it, and has watched it numerous times already.
B0085YNML2|3.0|This is a fun game, my daughter really enjoys it. Much like many other casual games, though, you'll play it for a bit, then forget you ever downloaded it. Fun, but forgettable.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|If more people could learn to communicate in this way, there would be much less brokenness in relationships and a greater chance of making peace in a troubled world.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I cannot tell you how great it was to own this blu ray before the final episodes aired in the US. It's nice to just sit and devote a night of watching episode after episode. Downton Abbey, please keep seasons coming and I'll continue to order your Blu ray sets.
B001EN71CW|5.0|How can you not love Firefly? Plus this was an amazing deal so we had to buy it! Great quality and our two day shipping only took one day, so what's not to love?
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Finally, a resolution that does a trilogy with such an amazingly striking visual aesthetic justice!  Although it lacks many special features dedicated to the original film, the Burly Man Chronicles (documentaries and special features dedicated to Reloaded and Revolutions) were endlessly entertaining.  I spent a whole Saturday just watching the documentaries included in the Ultimate Matrix Collection.<br /><br />The only part of this collection that left me disappointed was that the graphics in the iconic Burly Brawl (the scene where Neo confronts dozens of Smiths simultaneously) no longer hold up well because the Wachowski siblings had to scale down the quality of the CGI models in order to render everything on-screen simultaneously.
B0002IQAMW|2.0|The sound quality was poor comparing to other sacd cd's like Steely Dan Gaucho. I would not buy it. It shows front three channels but no back channels even though I did have some light sound out of them but my Yamaha Avenge amp may have been set to Enhanced.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Plot that will pull you in and have you up late into the night to see what happens next. She wrote this one before Gone Girl (loved this too) and it's just as good. Impressive character development. Looking forward to reading Dark Places.
B009EAO38C|5.0|These guys are amazing. I love listening to their music, with their blend of contemporary and classical sounds. Check them out on youtube to hear the whole songs--and watch the videos, which are hilarious. Usually, I'd just stick to youtube playlists, but these guys are worth supporting.
031250926X|5.0|My 3-year-old son is OBSESSED with this book!  This is our 3rd Brown Bear, Brown Bear book (thats how much he loves this story, he's loved the other two to death lol).  I would definitely recommend this &#34;Slide and Find&#34; version.  He loves opening and closing the &#34;doors&#34; (as he calls them) and recites the story to us at bedtime instead of us reading it to him.  The only disappointing part, which has been mentioned in other reviews, is it doesn't have the review page at the end to reinforce the animals they &#34;saw&#34;.  I'm not sure why they didn't include that part of the story, but we still love it anyway!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great read. Starts off a bit slow but then you're hooked! The twists are by far the gems of the story.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A very informative & helpful app. You can trust it for accuracy. I highly recommend it to keep up with weather predictions, not just where you, live but anywhere.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|this is the best board I could find for my fx 8350, fits perfect on the case and it has a really easy installing procedure. (theres no IDE) so I had to buy a sata dvd burner, buts its the new era!. nice board, really nice
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have always enjoyed solving puzzles.  Now that I do not have to pic up and reset I absolutely love this app.  So many to chose from very bright with color and some challenges. Thank you.<br /><br />Ooggie
B008NEMN0K|4.0|Enjoyed the movie but the 3d was not that great. The remakes in 3d do not seem to be very impressive.
B001CB4SRW|5.0|The Surge tool sheath does not hold the 40-bit-kit and extension.  The 934890 does... and it does it without bulging as if ready to burst.  Additionally the loops on the side will hold a mini-mag-lite or equivalent.  Recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great app.it shows you your own personal horse. it shows you all the steps to keep your horse happy, healthy, strong and active!its like having your own horse.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Excellent!  I am re-reading a lot of books that were once &#34;required&#34; reading in my High School Literature class.  This one was especially fresh and fun to read again.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I've asked people to teach me these skills before, because I am shy.  I have been told it's boring.  No one has actually told me this is what you do and how you do it.  It's about time there was a manual for the introverts in society.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I Recieved this album this morning in the mail, I wasn't dissapointed, Justin Hayward is so talanted and still can carry a tune....I love the tracks One Day, Someday...I agree with one of the other reviews that it's as good as View from A Hill which should be re released, It's been one of my all time favorites since I saw Justin In concert in San Diego in 1996. I really hope this work of art \\"Spitirts In The Western Sky\\" makes the charts worldwide, afew reasons...It's a great CD and Justin deserves more apprieciation for his talent...He with or without The Moody Blues Should be in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.Justin should be reconised for more than \\"Nights in White Satin\\"
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Hands down, it's better than most of the rock releases coming out these days.  It's amazing to hear these tracks performed and recorded using modern sound equipment.  You get a little taste of the entire catalog, and if you only listen to one track, \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" on this recording is even better than the album version.
B002RMVAZ8|4.0|This is the only version of Hamlet I have watched all the way through - I have seen bits of other productions, and watch documentaries on the making of Hamlet productions, but after seeing this version, they all seem lacking.<br /><br />The version with Mel Gibson might be the exception but haven't seen much of that one.
0345803507|1.0|Lame book sorry not for ages 20 and under well actually im 23 and i hated it.. even though everyone was reading it, I thought it was boring I would suggest it for women over 30.......
B006L9B6TI|3.0|I liked the concept but the writer kept repeating the same words and examples over and over. After all it will remind you to be positive and keep hops up. :)
B00338QENI|5.0|I had never heard of HeLa cells until the synopsis of this book. It was so well written, informative and engaging. The author wrote it so well it is impossible to tell it's her first book. This could have been a dry subject in textbook format but instead it read like a Michael Creighton novel filled with intrigue. I was surprised how it ended, a little disappointed for the family, but feel like I learned so much that I now have a new conversation starter for parties.
0596809158|4.0|It's a recipe book for learning R. I like the R in a Nutshell more than this one. . .
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I was hesitant about their new popish style for this album but I had no reason to be. Their songs are a little more upbeat but the essence of Tegan and Sara is still there. They still sing about heartbreak and love but approach it in a less emo, more retro 80's way. Definitely my second favorite album of theirs, after So Jealous.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story, quality of animated film and the light heartedness of all the different animals as characters.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|An interesting report of his own near death experience which leads him to investigate the phenomenon.  His approach is narrow in that he assumes his unique experience is universal.  There are thousands of years of reported phenomena of our brains that support an experience that cannot be explained by neuro-science.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one fabulous book for those who love a love story with all the &#34;adult adventure&#34; you can handle.  Well written and so exciting ( or should i say sexciting ) !!  For those adults who can handle it,,,GET IT AND ENJOY IT !!  Well written and such a great story line to it.  You wont want to put it down.  I can't wait to read the next two.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I loved this app. You get great books in many different categories. You can choose to get the free ones or pay a little for them (prices aren't bad at all). I also noticed that they try to add to their list of free items which is great as well. I downloaded quite a few over just a few days that have been very helpful to me. You can chose from cookbooks to busness and it really is all free. Now it still needs to grow a little more, but I have no problem growing with this app. If they keep adding, I will keep looking. Keep in mind that some of these books may not offer a lot of chapters with them, but don't let that stop you from getting it for free. It may be just what you need and that is not bad either. Great app!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I love this game! I love the different ways that you play.I just wanted more levels to play. Great job.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is just fun for everyone. The challenges become harder as you pass each session. You have three choices such as Arcade, and Classic. It is fun and before you know it, time has passed you by. Great to play with the kids or let them play on their own. A must have!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Season 2 lives up to season 1 and then some. I got this season Friday night and had the season finished by Sunday morning. Now I'm getting HBO just so I can watch season 3. Enough said!
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|The style of the way they filmed the movie was too chaotic for me and it was quite sad. My wife probably liked it more than me.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was I great book and it was very easy to get into, I highly recommend it! I couldn't set it down!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is asome I love it you get to have your own horse :D buy it it is asome
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I have so much FUN now!!<br />Their first album were awesome<br />I love the &#34;All The Pretty Girl&#34; , &#34;The Gambler&#34; & &#34;At least I'm Not As Sad(As I Used To Be)<br />Everyone must purchase it!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|cant wait for season 3  the drama and story lines are incredible and the acting is superb  love it  love it
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This album cheered me up<br />especially, the one of the track \\"Carry On\\" , it was so inspiring!!<br />I love Fun. and Nate's voice<br />This album was so special to me, such a storytelling from the Start to the end<br />Impressive!! As a result, i brought the Vinyl version too:)<br />everyone should go & buy it
B00BHMETKC|5.0|well worth watching  acting is phenominal and to think  this is based on a true story  i cheered at the end
B0053O89IS|5.0|thank you for such a cheap price. we are so happy with the product. we are collecting the series and was happy with finding it at such a great deal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Always terrific goods at good price, we visit Amazon first when we're looking for that item we just can't seem to locate in local stores... and we are nearly never disappointed.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Grate final movie to the men in black trilogy.  Once again great acting.  Good entertainment.  Out of this world.<br />Will order it again for a present for someone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Always terrific goods at good price, we visit Amazon first when we're looking for that item we just can't seem to locate in local stores... and we are nearly never disappointed.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I purchased this little sweeper years ago and used it mainly to sweep up around the cat's litter box.  It did the job and then some. But while shopping at Costco one day, I saw the Eureka stick vacuum with a pop out dust buster unit and thought it would be better.  It was considerably more expensive, but I thought it would be more powerful, right?  Wrong.  I gave my little sweeper to my mother-in-law.  She loves it and boy do I miss it!  The stick vacuum doesn't do nearly as good a job picking up stuff as this little sweeper did.  It's heavier and can't get into places the sweeper did.  I'm getting another sweeper.  Like other reviewers said, keep in mind what this is and what it will and will not do.  It's not a deep cleaner; it does a great job on surface cleanups. You will have to empty the tray often and follow directions as far as preserving the battery life of the unit.  It will not replace a vacuum or a mop.  It's made for light weight, in between jobs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Always terrific goods at good price, we visit Amazon first when we're looking for that item we just can't seem to locate in local stores... and we are nearly never disappointed.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|What a fantastic CD - so happy I ordered this music to add to my collection.  It sure is some great listening music.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic series provides a look at the workings of the servants and privileged class living in the most awesome manse. The story pulls one in.
B00993G41S|4.0|This is a old classic. One of the funniest movies, but not for kids. \\"kkkken is cccccoming to kkkill me!\\"
B008BM9L72|3.0|I did enjoy the books.  Candy for the brain and an easy read.  Three books were enough as I felt there was nowhere else for the main characters to go.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Got this for my nephew, who loves train.  This CD, which just came out last year, contains several songs that are already classic hits.  He loves this CD.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|I have never read this author before and found him interesting.<br /><br />Not an easy read for me but I did enjoy it as I haven't read anything like this for some time.<br /><br />I will be reading more of his books.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Really love this CD.  Great music from one of the greatest rock bands of all time, and it includes almost all their classics played live.  Doesn't get much better than this!
0756655307|5.0|I now have the basic knowledge of all Marvel characters thanks to this book. A good book for anyone who wants to know the origins of every character as well as knowing what comics to read. Very satisfied by this purchase.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book! The two main characters have similar problems while living out their lives under different constaints. The pressures of the the two societal positions are brought to life so well. Cruelty and kindness are present throughout this story.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|An important contemporary classic for every child.  Love the characters, love the story, love the humor.  We never tire of this wonderful film for all ages.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept me flipping the pages. I laughed cried an  enjoyed this book 1000% I would read it a million times over
B005GT3XGS|5.0|Bones is my favorite tv show.  I was very happy to find Season Six on Blu-ray for so cheap.  The quality of the discs is very good, everything was exactly as it said.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|I would strongly recommend this film. Clint is great in it. Touching as well.<br />Keep making films Clint!!<br />Rent or buy - you won't be sorry
B002JVWR4K|5.0|Bones is my favorite tv show and I was very excited to find the Fifth season on Blu-ray for so cheap.  The quality of the discs was excellent and everything I expected.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am addicted to this game. When I need to unwind, this is the game I choose to play. It is simple and fun to play.
B008AITJ24|5.0|Bones is my favorite tv show and I was excited to find this for so cheap.  It was everything I was expecting it to be.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|We like Bond movies and this one certainly did not let us down; however, we rented the HD anticipating a clearer picture and it was by far the worst picture we have seen from any of the movies we have typically rented from Amazon.
B0029XFN9O|5.0|no no no comment  no comment no comment non applicable no comment no comment how do we opt out non applicable
B006KX3GXO|4.0|This is one of the best photo editors I have ever had! I can use it to edit photos and make book covers. The only thing that needs to improve is the color splash.
0375847227|5.0|I've read the trilogy three times already.  I have given my son my first set of books and got another for myself.  What an awesome fantasy!  It's fun to image about life in an alternate universe and this has not one alternate but many!  It kept me engrossed and I couldn't put the books down until I was finished with all of them!  I normally read non fiction but this was so fun!  I highly recommend this book not for children but for teens and adults!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|hey this game is awesome!!!!!!:) I'm Minneapolis mad I cant defeat a levoe hey but still that's what keeps you goon y'all well by:)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Just so - so and not as interesting as the first two books.m  Did not hold my interest this time
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|This was one of the greatest action flicks every!!! Thor, Iron Man... hotties!!!!!! So much eye candy in this movie, it's hard not to enjoy this.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I can bring up the game but can't go anywhere from there.  It shows me the different games available and I can select smugglers cove but then can't do anything.  I'm a novice and this is my first game and very frustrating.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|I've long been a fan of Buddy Guy, and I love this compilation of an older, wiser, seasoned man. A bit more laid back than his earlier stuff, but in a really good way.
0143038419|5.0|such a cute story and nicely written. Movie does a great job of following book.  Just a cute story for light reading.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Not bad for a chic flick. I'm not a fan of singsong dance movies, if that's your thing you'll probably love it.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|MUSIC OF NASHVILLE Good music and very Nashville... Fun to listen to... Pretty darn good artists. Worth listening to in the car!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Just when you think you understand what's going on Nicholas sparks throws a curve ball. It is a very suspenseful romantic love story
B0083Z614S|5.0|After all these years, I decided to read this book, after years of loving the movie, not thinking the book would be as good (in my youth). Wow, couldn't stop reading this. A first rate real good, feel good book! Now I'll need to read the other free standard classics!
0618154043|5.0|The book arrived in great shape, and as described.  I would recommend this book to any Tolkien fan who is interested in learning more of the lore behind The Lord of the Rings.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|Used this app for graphing functions and it worked well.  It is also a good app for factoring polynomials.  I have only used this for a short time, so I haven't used all of the features yet, but what I have used worked very well.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It isnt exactly the best sharpener I have owned but for the price it is a steal. I keep it in my EDC just in case
B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of my favorite games of all time! The story, gameplay, battle mechanics, and extra features this game offers is amazing!
0525953590|4.0|Wow... I have to tell you that this is a great book; although it's kind of like a very spicy Thai or Indian dish: you have to take it in small bites. A great part of the book is a fairly easy read, but there are parts that, at least for me, required a re-read or two.  Be prepared to &#34;stop and ponder&#34; what you have just read.  Good book, makes you think about what is really going on in the sub-atomic world.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Its been on replay since the first day!!! :D I RECOMMEND this Album... Bruno Mars is the best! Cant wait till the concert!! :D
0723236186|5.0|This book has all the original illustrations, all the classic tales, & even a brief intro to each story about how or why Potter came up with its elements.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book! It is my 9 year old daughter's favorite. It deals with being different and would be great for any older child. My daughter's class is reading it together and they all love it.
0062101897|5.0|Amazing in-depth book! Far exceeded my expectations for a book! I highly recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans that want to continue to learn all there is to know about all the work that went in to making these amazing films.
1451695195|4.0|I am a volunteer for hospice. I have suggested this book to patients who are struggling with what happens after death. I remind them this is a story from a person who was a non believer of after death experiences. I think it is good to feel the soul and spirit of a person goes to a wonderful place, far from our understanding.
B00BHMEALA|4.0|This was a nail biting thriller even though I knew the ending.  Acting was outstanding and I even say it had some dark humor in it:  \\"This is the best bad idea we have!\\"<br /><br />The bravery of the Canadian Ambassador and his wife put tears in my eyes, as well as  the bravery of the Americans who stood up and were willing to put it all on the line to rescue just a few of these hostages.  Ben Affleck played his role perfectly, as did everyone else.<br /><br />It is always heartwarming to see that there are still some profiles in courage.  Too often  special heroes in the armed forces are never given their proper due....we need more stories like this to show how people are not willing to leave anyone behind if there is even a slim chance of rescue.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoy reading Lee Child's books with Jack Teacher this is my third one and have found them enjoyable and fun
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Intriguing, several twists of characters and plot and a surprise ending. Hard to put down! Great to see the good guys win.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I flew through this novel- a relatively easy read. The characters felt real enough that I was genuinely upset for them... having said that- they could have gone a lot farther with this story; but but since I haven't read the other two books in the trilogy maybe I'm being unfair. A good weekend read, nonetheless.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Purchased for my pregnant wife, who is a huge Friends fan. This gave her something to watch while relaxing or sick.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game! Very adicting. My three year old son and my five year old nephew love it!! I recommend it very much to keep kids busy. Only thing I dislike is that you can't really get a lot of gems unless you buy them.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|An early entry in the Harry Potter movies, still quite good and very watchable. The characters really are children in this film
B0091VTISO|4.0|This was a great adddition to the Conan the Barbarian series.  Great graphics and good story line.  Some really good action scenes with good special effects.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent resource on my phone. Great reading plans with reminders if you miss a day. Like having the availabilty on my Android so that I can access it anywhere.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed the story.  Nice easy read.  Nothing spectacular but again a nice easy read with a surprising but heart warming  ending..
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love it ....thanks for great price reduction from when I pre-ordered product.  It was fun to see one of the star from &#34;The Tudors&#34; in the cast  this season!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love books that keep you on the edge-of-your-seat. There has never been a dull moment. I am really looking forward to the next book of The Hunger Games series.
B0089XH38M|4.0|I know AVG to be a company of fine repute. AVG has found nothign untoward on my android phone yet though.
B00136NUG6|5.0|This totally throws me back to be a sophomore in high school:) Really great hits from a very classic band
B004PGO25O|5.0|Love this book.  A quick read and very insightful.  Resistance is everyone's enemy and this breaks it down simply and shows you a clear way forward.
B00846REIS|4.0|a friend recommended this series when we discussed that we had both read the &#34;shades of Grey&#34; series.  Written in the same vein,  for diversion this is good.l I think shades of grey had more drama and I wished this had more of a story line
B006VZS1EA|4.0|Son is in karate right now so he loves the boxing and fighting the robots do.  He also loves the game version on his Kindle as well.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This series is without a doubt the best sci fi show I have ever scene,  Why it only ran one season is beyond me.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|This new browser completely turned around my experience of my Samsung Galaxy S II. Finally the phone works liek it ought. Now I  hope to persuade the phone to cease scrambling my contact list!
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Enjoyed nearly all of the selections. One or two not as much to my taste, but overall well worth the money. The songs lose a bit of the impact that they have in the youtube videos because of the lack of all that gorgeous scenery. :-)  But I didn't downrate the album for that; not the fault of the CD. Hmmm....I never looked to see if there was a DVD available.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Well written and will hold your attention from beginning to end. One of those books that you won't  want to put down.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Get ready to swipe a bunch, this is an extension to the original Edge game and is just as wonderful and fun as the original game. I love how beautiful, yet simple, the graphics are. It did take me a LITTLE bit to get used to the 3D graphics (some things looked like a drop when they weren't) but that might have been me. After I got that figured out, this game turned out to be a BLAST! Dozens of new levels to extend the fun that was the original Edge. If you liked Edge, I can't recommend this further. If you've never played Edge, I might suggest picking that one up first. But you could play this game even if you never played the original.
B0037NVM1I|4.0|I can i say, its Arnold and the Terminator.  Great action and not a bad story.  So, i am a scifi geek...
B008EZVNO0|3.0|I thought the cd was ok. I wasn't impressed with his latest work. I was expecting more probably because of what the ads were saying that it was supposed to be awesome and to me it wasn't.  For the most part I like his cds but, this one I did not. I would not recommend this one.
B009FZFONO|2.0|By all means, watch the series. It's pretty amazing and addicting to watch, but the 2nd part of the 3rd season... well... changes. It becames more about the drama for the first 90% of the show and then, at the end of the episode, it feels like they purposely add a 5 minute cliff hanger. Not sure if I am going to contiunue buying the shows anymore. Maybe when it becomes free someday I'll watch it, but for now, not worth buying.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|If I could figure out how to get my docs to open in it I would probably like it. It seems to have a number of good features. I have a few PDFs in my Docs \\"folder\\" but I cannot figure out how to use this app to read them.<br /><br />Edited: I figured out how to get my PDFs \\"into\\" a place where this reader will find them. Connect your Kindle to your computer, go into the Kindle Internal Storage folder and find the exPDF Reader folder. Inside this folder is another labeled \\"Library.\\" Copy your PDFs into this folder and they will show up in the exPDF library when you open the app. The reader works great and my PDFs look very good.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love this contemporary reboot of Sherlock Holmes! I was skeptical at first but now I find myself extremely mad that the season are so short. Great writing and acting bring it all together seamlessly into an awesome TV show.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|The graphics are pretty amazing, but the slow gameplay drives me nuts. I wish it would skip all the theatrics and just go to the next level already.<br /><br />This is &#34;From Cheese&#34;, a game where you create a path from cheese to a mouse that the mouse then follows to get to the cheese. You need to navigate obstacles in order to complete most of the levels. The graphics are pretty awesome. But it takes its time scoring after each round and then in the next stage the mouse comes out, jumps on the silverware, and has it land on its back before you can start to play. It is cute for a level or two, but then it gets annoying. I wish I could just skip those, this game would get twice as good if it did.
B00111L0MY|5.0|The package got here before the estimated time, no damage on the box or the product, everything was in good conditions, but it took a while to ship.
B009A882D0|5.0|I have many great memories remembered from listening to these songs of great times I had while growing up and hanging out with my friends. Experiences that I will always treasure for a long time.<br />After I listened to the whole cd I borrowed to a friend at work and she listened to it and thought it was awesome also. And  told me that it brought back alot of memories for her also.<br />Thanks for a great time listening and remembering the good times!
0765325950|5.0|My husband is very happy with the book.  Robert Jordan is his favorite author, my husband has collected all Robert Jordans books.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Got here on time and the box looks good. Probably won't watch until next christmas so won't really know until then.
B00136NUG6|5.0|For the price of $1.99, this was an awesome purchase.  I like the way the download integrated with my itunes with no problem.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Mahjong. While I enjoyed this, I think original Mahjong is more my thing but it was nice to take a quick diversion on this 3D version of Mahjong. Not bad for a dollar to try something new. I got over an hour of gameplay on this, enjoying it the entire time, which I think is well worth a dollar.
B00BLCHL4Y|4.0|I have been watching the mini videos on facebook for the last two weeks and from what I can see based off this as well its going to be something I will watch to the very end. This life they live has heart, its a part of us that died a long time ago... when we became civilized...many parts of our culture and family history were destroyed or rewritten. Watching this reminds me of what was...
1577314808|5.0|First off, let me make one thing absolutely clear.  I am not a philosopher or some student of metaphysics... just a casual reader with my own set of problems like everybody else.<br /><br />If you're someone who reads books on spirituality and enlightenment because you enjoy some kind of mental challenge, or is looking to increase your 'knowledge' about the field - this book is probably not for you.<br /><br />If you're expecting some king of special, new-found wunderkind self-help technique on the cutting edge in Tolle's writing, this book is probably not for you.<br /><br />If your cup is already full...this book is probably not for you.<br /><br />Some critics despised the book and called Tolle a fraud because they thought the contents were just a reinterpretation of Zen.  What did they expect?  Some new scientific advancement in meditation that can make you see halos around other people's head?  Every self-help and spirituality book out there is practically a reinterpretation (even those that claim to be original) based on past religious and spiritual practices around the world.  Tolle is no different in that regard.  What's brilliant about this book is the fact that the author himself has gone through a spiritual transformation and has achieved enlightenment - he shares his knowledge and process in a way that is simple, clear, and precise to the point.<br /><br />The funny thing is - the first time I picked up this book and read the first 5 chapters - about 4 years ago, I thought it was pure baloney.  It's been sitting on my bookshelf ever since.  The other day, for no specific reason, I took it out and started reading...and what a difference it has been!  Every paragraph made sense - I understood (and felt) what the man was saying.  What changed?
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The restauration is great and the three films are excellents. I am very satisfied. I hope including in future restauration the film PAPILLON for Steve McQueen, in Blu-ray disc.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great show.  We really enjoy it, and in fact we cant get enough.  We have watched all 3 seasoins in 1 week.
B009D0LBRO|3.0|This game was fun, for about 5 minutes.  The side scrolling action that will only allow you to move in one direction makes this game much more difficult than it needs to be.  Once I got into the higher levels I just gave up.  Its not expensive so it is worth a try.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a great app and well worth the two dollars it is asking for. Hours of gameplay! You draw a stickman (I hope you've figured that out so far) but then draw other things to solve puzzles. You don't have to be an artist, but I can see how this might encourage your imagination to a higher level of life. It is fun and easy to play. Highly recommended!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Each season gets better and better.  This season has more joy, tragedy, hope, excitement, and just plain awesomeness than the 2 before it.  Don't wait.  Get it now and be ready for Season 4 when it comes out next year.  Fingers crossed they keep up the quality and passion they've always had!
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Unexpected twist at the end an all around great movie!! Liam nelson at his best.. Action, drama and butt kicking it's worth buying new
B000IOM0WY|5.0|this film development  an argument very fascinant, coherent and very action in secuences. its one film favorite in my collection.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|I am very pleased with this case. It's not too big so you don't feel like you're lugging things around but it IS big enough for the Canon 7d with a wide angle lens. Looks very sturdy and well made.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I saw this at the movies (I go to the movies at least 40 times a year), and had to add it to my DVD/Blu Ray collection.  The actors do a wonderful job, and I certainly could relate to some aspects of the stories.  I was intrigues by the young, energetic man who runs the hotel -- how great would this world be if everyone had his glass-full optimism!!
B004Y042N8|4.0|This is simple and fun and good for passing a little time. The puzzles are usually quick to do, so pulling this out during a two or three minute break and doing a couple of puzzles is not too difficult. It is challenging enough to keep me interested and keep going.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I think this Pocket Pal Sharpener made by &#34;Smith&#34; is useable, but I would prefer the diamond impregnated rod to be a little longer.
0767834739|5.0|I would have to say this is the best resident evil movies plenty of action and milla is at the top of her game beautiful as always
B00957T6X6|5.0|actually started watching the series before  knew they were books. The books are much better! It s very well written
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's an ok game still trying to get the hang of it. It takes a little thought. It not one of those games that you can do without a little planning. I bought it on a whim and so far haven't gotten bored with it I do get easily bored with these kinds of games.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Got it on sale for cheap after having the free version.  Works the same, not seeing how it's any different from the free version, so to me it was a needless expense.  Good thing it was on sale...
B00683JK9K|5.0|I've never played another puzzle app, so I don't know what to compare it to. But I like this one. A lot. It is easy enough to navigate around. You can get as challenging as you would like. And I like the pictures (a big bonus on that)! It's great and a welcomed substitute when I can't be putting together puzzles at home. if you enjoy puzzles, you may want to give this a shot, too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The &#34;Holy Bible YouVersion&#34; can come with me anywhere I can do daily devotionals, highlight verses, and bookmark verses.<br />Thanks
B008KEQMDC|5.0|OMG I laughed and I cried.. This movie has it all.. Beautiful cast and full of talent and potential, plenty of LOL moments u won't be disappointed well worth buying new
B0038Q3UKA|5.0|Years ago Lupu made a poor recording of two piano music with Murray Perahia, a very great pianist.  It seems Perahia prevailed in performing the music faster than Lupu wanted which resulted in a dreadful performance.  At the first hearing, I concluded it was because of Lupu being a mediocre pianist.  I highly dislike the way Lupu performs Brahms Op. 119/4 - Murray's performance is so fine it's divine.  But Lupu plays many of the other compositions in a manner worth hearing.
0425170349|5.0|The book came in great condition. Fast Ship! It was a present for my boyfriend, he loved it and enjoyed reading it.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable - made me want to throw away my new Nike Vomero's! This book is very motivating and will make anyone want to start running.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|This isn't bad for a buck, especially since there are sooooo many levels (seems like hundreds). The puzzles are entertaining and challenging. The graphics are okay, which is probably the only negative thing I can say about this (I think the graphics could have been a lot better).  The sound is decent and not heavily annoying.
B005Z28M58|5.0|Great slender holder. This is a great season sad that they are no longer making this series. great show. :)
B004SEUJ82|4.0|This is a film adaptation of a book of the same name by John Boyne.  Although completely fictional and highly improbable, the movie has a visceral punch that will literally knock the wind out of you.  Briefly, the movie is about a German family in which the father become the commandant of a Jewish concentration camp (in the book, the camp is identified as Auschwitz).  The story-line unfolds as though we are seeing the events happen through the wide-eyed naive eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of the commandant.  Bruno quite accidentally forms an unknowing friendship with another 8 year old boy, but this boy, the boy in the striped pajamas on the other side of the fence, is a Jew. Bruno is completely ignorant of what is happening in the camp, which he believes to be a farm. When the commandant's wife realizes that the camp is a death camp, (apparently she too is blissfully unaware of the purpose of the camp), she has a falling out with her husband and demands to take the children away.  On the very day they are set to leave, events occur that lead to the climactic and sobering ending.<br /><br />While thoroughly improbable in terms of the plot, in my opinion, this film still packs a powerful punch.  Critics, many of them Jewish critics, assailed this film for its improbability and for the naivete of the characters, in effect implying that the typical German citizens of the day did not know the meaning or intent of the death camps.  This is a valid criticism, but in the film's defence, this again is NAZI Germany seen through the eyes of a boy.  It is not meant to be a film that exposes all the evils of the Jewish Final Solution.  The film's ending is quite a bit different from the book's ending, but the effect is just as powerfully moving and sobering.<br /><br />This film is definitely not suitable for children up to age 13.<br /><br />kone
B004JC16LC|5.0|It is evident that Furtwangler is the model for many good conductors.  The quality of the music performance is more important than the sound quality.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|The movie was fun. The music and dancing were good. Anyone who likes rock can enjoy this movie.  the end

B0085YNML2|4.0|This is easily worth a dollar. The graphics are cute and the sound effects aren't too bad or annoying. I like the challenge of the game as it is one that can keep you occupied for a long time. My only wish is that it came with a better tutorial, but you get used to it after playing it for a while.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|If you buy special person like Carmen,they can get deleted for mo reason and not by you also. Do not get this app.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Book and Cheryl's story were awesome and inspiring.  I have passed the book on to friends and my daughter. Look forward to reading more.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|While the read was super easy, it still held on to me with a way that is unexplainable.  I was sucked in, wondering what was coming next.  Who was at fault here.  While throughout the story, the main character is known to be the bad man, it isn't until the end that you know the truth.  He is still a bad person, but you love him for it.  This was well written, and while I read it fast, it brought me inside of his mind.  Understanding why he felt the way he did, why he isolated himself, and in the end I no longer believed he was \\"that\\" guilty.  I will definitely recommend this to my friends!
B00746O3X8|5.0|Excellent harness, it leaves my hands totally free for climbing or snowshoeing yet keeps my T2i and 400mm ready to shoot in a second.  The camera rides quietly and securely on my chest while putting minimal pressure on my neck and shoulders even with a shooting chair and tripod hanging from the sides of the harness. I use the camera strap around my neck and the little safety strap  attached to the camera on one end and the lens on the other.  The hip holster seems as good but have not had opportunity to use it yet.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series!!  We did not begin watching it unti January 2013, and zipped through seasons 1 & 2 without delay.  Season 3 was a must, so we purchased it.  Unfortunately, we have watched all episodes, and now have to wait until Season 4 comes out.  May have to rewatch everything one more time!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I can see this being played for hours on end, which is not a bad way to spend $3, but it is way too small. I'm playing this on a Galaxy S3, one of the larger phones. I can't even imagine this being enjoyable on a tablet unless you get it stretched to 10 inches. The details is very fine and hard to spot without some eye strain. After half an hour my eyes couldn't take it any more. The graphics are great, but they are a little too great, unless you have a large screen to catch the details.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|The film misses important parts from the novel, and since I've read it beforehand it didn't really excite me. It does however get to the point of visualizing the contrast of the capital to the districts and you will feel for the characters.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I especially like the feature that tells you how long it will take to recharge the device. I loaded this app on my Kindle Fire and Android phone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome...love subway surfer Rio..just installed subway surfer<br />Rome..Awesome..the egg is cool..New colors and graphics..watch out<br />your eyes will trick you..lol..enjoy everyone..
B00005JOA0|4.0|If you enjoy British dramas, here's one for you.  Acting and script are exceptional.  Downton Abbey fans will like it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I don't think I've seen a movie that sticks in my mind as much as \\"Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" since I saw \\"The Notebook.\\"  This story is the story of a young man entering high school, which has enough drama to carry a movie almost all the time, but it is taken to a whole other level by the dark undercurrent that \\"something has happened\\" to the young man just before he got there. Scenes of usual teenage angst are interposed with therapy journal writing and anti-psychotic pill taking.<br /><br />Set in the early 1980's, the movie expertly captures the free spirit of the day. (Beware parents - scenes of drug use abound... as they did in the 80s, of course.)  Luckily, our poor anti-hero freshman is taken under the wing of two outrageous wild-card seniors and his whole life undertakes a change.<br /><br />The movie as a whole reminds me much of an edgy version of John Hughes' \\"Some Kind of Wonderful.\\"  It's a great show, but be prepared for shock after shock as revelations unroll and friendships unravel.  There are no slow parts to this emotional rollercoaster.  8.5/10
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This does a great job of creating ambient noise, which can be really relaxing and helps me relax or even fall asleep. There are over 40 noises, including ocean sounds, running water, and rain (if you can't tell, I like water noises). There is also wind, a clothes dryer, airplane, and tons more. I'm surprised at the selection, first of all, but I'm blown away by how realistic all the noises sound. It is a great way to get some relaxing background noise.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I added this to my apps and it is really easy to use and makes it amazon friendly for those of us who are not teens.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|For Frank Sinatra fans, this is a must-own CD. With Count Basie and his band performing with The Chairman of the Board, you can't go wrong. Enjoy !!

6305907145|5.0|There is more than one Mansfield Park on DVD.  This is the one that is my favorite, due to the casting and superb performances of the actors.  Downton Abbey folks, buy it!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book ! Any of you Rick Riordan fans out there will love this book!It is a amazing and funny book!
0374214913|5.0|Loved this book.  Have passed around to all my avid reader friends who also loved it.  Many of them bought it just to have a copy in their library.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Definitely not as good as the first book. It dies slowly from the middle to the end. I did enjoy it. A quick read.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I had a need for a versatile all-in-one sharpener for a variety of cutting edges around my home and shop. While browsing in Amazon, I found this unit and gave it a try. The advertised features looked good, and as usual, Amazon's prices were great. After receiving and using this sharpener, it has exceeded my expectations. The two-stage mounted sharpeners in the handle do an excellent job on both straight and serrated knife edges, and the included fold-out diamond  rat-tail honing tool is very good for the final dressing. In addition to standard household sharpening, I also use handheld chisels in my wood turning operations in my shop. This diamond honing tool does a fantastic job of dressing out my chisels for use on the wood lathe, and because of the way it is mounted in the handle, it is easy to maintain control of the stroking of the hone. Overall, I love the tool, and I would recommend it to anyone for general knife and specialized tool sharpeing.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|This CPU is currently used in a HTPC (Home Theater Personal Computer) and has performed very well.  We've been using it for over a month now.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />-HD4000 Graphics - Not too shabby, able to play some older games at reasonable resolutions/settings<br />-Plenty fast for most tasks and adequate for gaming<br />-Power efficient<br />-Included fan is adequate and fairly quiet.  CPU idles at ~30C with the fan speed at 20%.<br />-Hyper-threading<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-Does not support PCIe 3.0.  Only the Core i5 and i7 processors do at this time.  This is no big deal.  Testing has found there is only a 2-3% difference at most between PCIe 2.0 and 3.0 on the most powerful video cards.  In many cases, there is no noticeable difference.<br />-Intel HD graphics did not work well with live TV.  This caused a stuttering issue that, according to posts in the Intel forums, has been resolved with a new driver update.<br /><br />This processor offers a great balance between processing power, energy efficiency and video capability - perfect for most computing needs including use as a HTPC or media server.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|The reason I didn't give this a five is because there is a much, much better version available on DVD starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.  This is not a bad production, but why not get the one with the best acting and direction?
B0061QD88S|5.0|my daughter wanted a bunch of Disney movies for her college dorm, this was one on her list she enjoyed the movie
1416550550|5.0|This book does not disappoint.  The characters and story lines are so realistic and heartening.  Did not want the story to end!
B00328R21C|5.0|There isn't much you can say about Legos.  They are a tried and true staple in any young man's life.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I found a great deal of value in her story, but often found myself groaning over the wording used. It felt like a lot of other New age jargon that has lost it's power to move the reader due to overuse. What kept me going was the memory of a live interview she gave, which convinced me of her sincerity, as well as the worth of her message. It felt more like an editing issue rather than Moorjani herself. I would steer many readers who find the lingo taxing to watch or listen to some interviews with her instead, because the story is worthwhile, but perhaps not in this medium.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|I had watched this comedy years ago when it first came out.  The quality of this particular DVD is excellent, picture and sound.  I always enjoy Kevin Kline who is just outstanding among this cast of great comedians.  The goofy story is so well written and executed that I always find new elements to laugh about.  This film delivers on so many levels and it is so much better than many &#34;newer&#34; comedies that try too hard to be funny.  &#34;Wanda&#34; is the real deal!<br />Hard to Please
B00785P2QC|4.0|Wish you could purchase this game outright, why the Facebook game style???<br />The first two games in this series are awesome.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Learned a great deal about the way of life in the south before the civil war.  Well written and fast moving read.
0307956350|2.0|This book was unbelievably bad from the get go.  I expected so much more from the ratings I had reviewed.  I read it quickly trying to get it over with as soon as possible.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was difficult to zip up without holding it together on all sides.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Best songs,best lyrics..simply the best!! Rodreguez is one of a kind! It is a shame that this true tresure was burried for so long!!
B00APUYN0I|2.0|I was expecting something much more funny than this.  This was just Glee with college kids and some light swearing.

B008LFY6NI|5.0|spin art is interesting and fun game that is very colorful and it is so creative I love it. my family thinks that people can enjoy it
B008220DIC|3.0|You know, I read the 5 star reviews of this movie and I say, \\"Yeah, that was a great movie!\\" Then I read the one star reviews and I say, \\"Yeah, that was one strange and boring mess!\\" Thank goodness I've got two thumbs...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This really helps kids with being creative as they build their house, it is amazing that both my 8, 11 and 15 year old all enjoy it equally! Well worth the money...
B000IJ79WU|1.0|We don't know how to return merchandise and it never worked.  We need help with returning the item please.  Could someone contact us??
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|I was REALLY looking forward to this movie, then heard friends say &#34;it's a little much, even for a musical&#34; so I kept putting it off.  I'm so glad I finally got around to it renting it.  Julianne Hough is so damn cute, and all the stars delivered!  The cameo's were great, and as much as I think Tom Cruise is a puke, he really REALLY did a great job!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book I had to continue reading the book 2 times it was so good the third book was gruesome
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|These three main actors are incredible - their characters complex and interesting, even if not very likable. I'll see anything Phillip Seymour Hoffman is in. Joaquin Phoenix brought his A game to this. Often this was a tough film to watch as the story wasn't simple or pleasant but very human. Amy Adams as you've never seen her.  Not what I was expecting - a story about cult leader and his following, more about complex, flawed people, what they want to believe about themselves and their lives and how they really live them. Nice to see Laura Dern in this, too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Poor Rick, he needs a win.  They all do, except the governor! I know he's lost a lot, but they all have. It's made him evil.
B0006B2A42|5.0|With a star like Rock Hudson you can count on this film to be good. He was big box office in the 1960's and any film he released then got attention. All action adventure so those fans will love it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a psychological thriller which keeps you eagerly reading until the end.  I have trouble remembering that this is the author's first book.  She has a wonderful talent.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed the whole series<br /><br />Kindle fire is the best way to read totally enjoy it.<br />Can't wait to finish reading more
B005LAIIS0|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite movies of 2012. Liam Neeson shines in this movie, keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|This film is very understated, but its beauty is in that very simplicity. I feel affected in a different way by this film than other war film I've seen. I feel almost like I experienced it, in a very small way. I could see it really happening the way it was depicted. One major difference is that I didn't cry, which I always do during war movies. I think it was because I felt more present in it. Bravo- truly- to the crew that produced such an authentic pseudo-experience for its audience, to help those of us who have never killed understand just a little better.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I haven't always loved books but Rick riordan knows how to  write them. His books make reading fun. They are full of humor, action and are full of fun
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|It was a good read and perfect for long trips on a train, car or plane. Settle back on a rainy day and read this.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is a very descriptive look at early onset Alzheimer's disease. As an educator for the long term care industry, I will recommend this book to those who work with or care for those with dementia

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follet somehow manages to navigate a huge cast of characters, weaving them through complicated and compelling historical events without losing their humanity up against such a massive e backdrop as world war1. An admirable work, impossible to put down because of its entertainment value and hey, surprise,you learned something too!  Highly recommended...I'm launching right into book two of the trilogy as we speak!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|They do not make good movies or series much anymore very entertaining and keeps you interested, and look forward to other parts of the serie's.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app.  I have played it for a year probable.  I was having problems just lately with a marmalade error on my android and kindle.  I couldnt play.  Help desk told me to uninstall on both and reinstall.  My android came up great and works.  Now for the kindle.  This drawsomething says my kindle is not compadible. What!!!! This is for the kindle.  I dont understand.  Says this app is not compatible and not availble for download.  Something is wrong and I dont know what to do.  I bought the paid version  so no ads.  Now I cant even download the app.  Im sad. Hope someone cam help me.

0307744434|5.0|I had thought that after reading this novel a second time, it would be easier to review but I was wrong.  Reading it again put me in even more awe of it because I noticed things the second time around that I missed the first. I find that reviewing it now is even more daunting because my words are insufficient to adequately describe the….um…see I’m already failing to come up with an adjective worthy of this novel.  Amazing? Awesome? Astounding?  Why do they all start with “a”?  Regardless of my lack of vocabulary, this is a novel that will bring out more emotions than you thought possible while confusing you and making you wonder why they heck you keep reading.<br /><br />It’s a bit difficult to summarize this story because it encompasses so much.  The most basic description I can give is that it follows two characters, a girl named Celia and a boy named Marco, for a very long period of time, almost thirty years in fact.  Both have only been told that they are a participate in a game but their respective teachers refuse to give them any more description than that.  How do you win the game?  Who is my opponent?  How do we compete? What is the purpose?  They are never told.  But both strive to succeed to attain the respect of their teachers. The only thing that becomes clear is that the venue for the competition is Le Cirque des Reves.  This tale follows the pair throughout the duration of the challenge.<br /><br />The above description does not even begin to do justice to the sheer loveliness of this story.  But, before I start fangirling, I’ll state what will annoy the daylights out of you, at least on your first read.  The main source of the confusion is the way the story jumps around.  Though the tale is “mainly” about Celia and Marco, it has many, many (many, many, many, many, many) more characters and it jumps around from different perspectives and even time periods.  One moment you are reading about Celia being trained at a young age, then you jump ten years in the future to the perspective of a boy named Bailey who has nothing to do with anything beyond the fact that the circus arrives in his town and he falls in love with it.  Then you jump to a clockmaker in Germany who is commissioned to make a special clock for the circus.  And that is just the tip of the iceberg.  For the first half of this novel, you can’t make any sense out of it.  I remember thinking during my first read how I wished it would just stay with Celia or Marco because I found the pair so interesting, but alas, my wish wasn’t granted.  Though now, I’m glad that it wasn’t because I appreciated the many perspectives so much more during the second go.  It jumps to completely unrelated sequences in the most haphazard fashion imaginable.  Where the heck is Erin taking this story?!?! How the hell are all the people’s perspectives going to line up in a way that makes sense?  Why the heck am I still reading this infuriating thing?!?!?<br /><br />If you stick through the first half, well you are in for a treat.  In the second half, everything starts coming together.  Celia and Marco meet and fall in love like we all knew they would and everything actually does wrap up rather nicely.  All the random people start to become connected with the story in ways you weren’t expecting and it made me wonder how the author managed to write something so stunning that I was in speechless.  The first comment I want to make is that the writing is gorgeous.  Erin Morgenstern writes in this brilliant way that describes every setting perfectly, but not in that overly dull, I’m wasting your time writing five pages describing this utterly plain England countryside way that some authors insist on doing (::coughs:: JRR Tolkien ::coughs::).  It just completely enchants you to the point that even though it’s irritating you, you keep reading, if only to see the elegant way the story is portrayed.  You grow to love all the characters, even the ones that you have no idea how they relate to the story.<br /><br />This novel is that perfect fairy tale for adults that we’ve all been craving.  It has that indefinable magical quality that hooks into you and leaves you seeing stars.  It is the type of book that demands a second read, possibly immediately after the first because you see things through a different light.  I’m hesitant to make this comparison because these two novels are nothing alike, but it demands a reread the same way Fight Club does because after everything is revealed in the end, you see so many things more clearly and completely differently than the first time.  It’s utterly fantastic and I recommend it to every single individual on this planet with access to it and the ability to comprehend it.<br /><br />****Thank you to Vintage Books/Anchor Books for providing me with a review copy in exchange for an honest review****ou have no idea how they relate to the story.<br /><br />This novel is that perfect fairy tale for adults that we’ve all been craving.

B0017V7GTY|5.0|Sometimes an album comes along that captivates you so completely that you're never the same after hearing it. These records are rare but every once in a while they sneak up and surprise you in the most joyous and life-affirming way possible. The '59 Sound is one of those records. Every note, every word, every song is played to perfection and composed so beautifully that you can't help but be pulled into its world of broken hearts, classic cars, Southern accents, and New Jersey atmosphere. Brian Fallon and his bandmates have crafted what I consider to be the perfect album. I simply can't find anything that I would change or tweak; it all flows seamlessly in one complete package.<br /><br />This album is sheer perfection on every level. After one listen I knew I was a fan for life and The Gaslight Anthem is now one of my favorite bands. Their music is so powerful and honest, not to mention smartly written and well played. Do yourself a favor and give it a spin. It may very well work the same magic for you that it did for me on that snowy drive when I first heard it. This album takes me back to those snow-swept streets and brisk January air. I haven't been the same since and that's the best compliment I can give any piece of work.

B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Just couldn't get into it at all... the set and costumes were beautiful and I'm familiar with the story... but the way the movie was shot as if a stage production and did not appeal to me at all; lost interest almost immediately.
