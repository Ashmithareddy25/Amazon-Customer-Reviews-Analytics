B005COL0DA|4|I used these to seal the ends of hockey skate laces at my ice rink.  They worked really well for that.
B00DJ4FIMO|5|I am satisfied with the quality.
B00FXWLD88|5|Nice add on! Great for keeping junk out of the connector body or protecting live terminal ends in the shell.<br />They fit the SB50 just fine even with the extra T handle installed to aid in disconnecting.
B00UE2T8FC|1|Armor is lower than the knees
B004UTA7SW|5|I just love this plate cover. Fits perfectly.
B000B5QFE4|4|they are ok ,wish the mirror was a little bigger ,easy install
B000X1XZV2|5|Fits my 2012 ML350 perfectly. I like the lip around the perimeter and the feel of the plastic is good
B000C16XO4|5|This window regulator worked perfectly after I installed it and my daughter is very happy with it
B00K6L86F4|5|fit well as a replacement
B0012RI5IO|5|For my 2004 toyota sienna. Fit great, easy install, under 60 min. Longest part is just taking off and putting car panels back on. Connections were quick clips, very easy. Able to tow a pop up trailer with no problems.
B00F66J6WQ|4|It is a great pump and suits my application.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is not exactly as advertised.  The part no. listed is what I received.  However, it is not manufactured by Kawasaki rather it is by Progressive Suspension.  The flexible hose is not 8 in. rather it is 5 in.  Personally, I do not care whether it is by Kawasaki but that may be important to some.  Further, the 5 in. hose is fine for my application, Kawasaki Nomad.
B0002V9IFU|3|It doesn't clean my leather seat.
B002P8HIPU|5|fit like a glove
B001JT5CFY|1|Crap broke on the second day. Do not buy!!!
B00KNEWIHG|5|ITS NOT A STICKER, ITS MORE LIKE A PEICE IF CARDBOARD
B005SUX9MI|5|Works well and fast shipping! Thanks.
B00KML1SVW|5|great product!
B00MW8G2IW|1|Very poore.you cannot do it yourself but when call assistance you are directed back to the websites which offers nothing.
B001NAU9NE|5|great product!
B00BQE5JAK|5|very happy
B00JLJV564|5|Absolutely a perfect fit, extremely Easy to install, very pleased!!!
B00IC6LE54|5|Perfect!

B00T36HLYU|5|Perfect condition, great price, quick delivery  and replaced a  pair of 10900 off of a traded 2010 Chevy.  Lots of folks ask me where I got them..?!!  Fits 2014 Chevy Crew Cab.
B009PIOEBO|5|The Husky Liners for my back cargo area in my Ford Escape is ideal. It's perfect for that area, needed only a slight weight to help it &#34;sit&#34; and form it's shape in that area...and for only a day. The extra &#34;lip&#34; all the way around is what hooked me. This will help with the hauling of bags of dirt and other gardening supplies I am likely to do. I will be ordering the husky liners for the front floor and back seat floor areas soon, as this will be what I will need for winter time snow and ice I will be dragging in on my boots here in Michigan.
B004RCP502|4|Looked for a long time for these bulbs finding only new LED bulbs for big bucks.  Thanks Amazon for having so many things I need.
B0007Y4P9G|4|worked
B00PP6ORAS|3|These emblems are of good quality. But? They are both for, only, one side of the vehicle!<br />The other side, would have the &#34;SS&#34; leaning the opposite way! Unless these are made to replace the front or rear, of the vehicle.
B002PYBZJO|5|Great product for retrieving error codes. Saved hundreds of $s versus going to dealer.
B00O1CX3DY|5|So far so good. Amazon ended up shipping me the gray primer instead of the jet black paint. I ended up just keeping the primer, I have had it on my motorcycle exhaust for about a month now and so far no peeling or cracking. IF it stays on for  another month or two I will buy the paint and put it over the primer. Went on smooth looks professionally done if you do several quick light coats. So far 5 stars for the product.  a tad expensive but so far it looks to be worth it. Disappointed in amazon. however I love amazon prime and this is the first time they have messed up so I can forgive them.
B001B6VUTM|4|Good quality product at a competitive price
B0015Y7QAC|5|They go over the trailer tires as advertised. Honestly they do.
B00OJF7Y5G|5|Works great.. fit perfectly..
B000EAIERW|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ
B00SAIX0EC|1|instructions were very, very poorly written and was for 4 different items.  Did not work as advertised.  Would NOT ever buy from this company again.
B00V59NIQI|5|Truck rides alot better...
B004I12424|5|The only problem is now the right side one looks bad.  This fits and looks great, like new from the factory.
B00008RW9U|5|This is for my husband.  He has had one of these for years and time to replace it.
B000LG9AXQ|5|It was exactly what I needed and very easy to program!
B004WLNZZA|5|They work well and are made well and the price is reasonable.
B007VSYNXY|5|Fast easy install. Gives my VQ35DE a nicer sound as well. Worth the money
B00GU5J122|1|It got clogged up in the first 3 days then it rained doest d9 anything for hp it lost it. I dynod it net loss 1.5 who.
B00GSAUHB8|5|excellent! It fits my car window perfectly and was super easy to install. Should have gotten it years ago!!
B0081UZK6U|1|Absolute nightmare trying to install-  much easier to replace the whole compressor
B0033HZQUG|5|great performance restored power replaced originals after 215,000
B0077K8J7C|3|Its a good brake parts cleaner.
B008XNZZ7O|2|Made my car smell funny. Not bad...just funny..
B000EDUTN6|3|Could not passed plumbing inspection with it. Needed to get a Watt lead free valve for re-inspection.
B0007RVLHW|5|Went from Mothers detail spray to this and can't tell a difference
B001SEUIJ0|5|WORKED  GREAT
B004QL21OC|5|Received these headlights , everything looked good but they aren't the ones they fit my vehicle.. They are brand new and never been installed.  Unfortunately I'm working with military so I realized it too late because I was on DET..  I have a skyline so these are illegal to install on my car..  If anyone wants a deal on them contact me.<br /><br />Nshankins@gmail.com
B001RBCU90|5|Love
B007PMY3MM|2|The product was clearly manufactured overseas with little attention to detail. I received the product and to my disbelief, both were constructed in the same fashion rendering a set of two driver side seat belt shoulder pads. Unfortunately there is relatively little one can due as it would cost more in ones time to go through the hassle of making a return. However, it is sufficient in appearing to its original form from a distance; i.e. cars passing by... I'd also like to mention the specificity briefly, insofar that upon immediate notice of opening the package, the letters were poorly stitched and lopsided and canted. I'm not sure if this was a product defect, but considering my foreknowledge of making purchases over time, I can say with authority that any item which alludes to being a product of German origin, but by its own recite notes its origin from Asia, then I can only assume with certainty that this product was made in an alleged low regulatory and mass produced facility where copies and repro-fakes are allegedly produced. These comments are of my own opinion, from my own empirical observation, and in no way are representative to, or in part of commercialized propaganda, product solicitation, or business malpractice. These comments are made by free expression, and constitute honest and valid empirical observations from qualified consumerism.<br />Basically, if you're looking for something of value and quality, keep looking, if you don't care, then buy it... That is all.
B00I82RXSE|5|good fit
B00NB8TGVW|2|About half out the box worked, But enough to do the interior.
B00332GO52|4|Installed easily and worked with cap
B00B76AWSG|5|This is shoe leather dye not shoes, worked well
B00332GMU4|4|Installed easily and worked with cap
B004I19DGO|5|Quality headlight at a very fair price.  The installation was a breeze.
B000CIY0U6|5|Awesome cover at a great price.
B001550DVU|5|Great product really what I was looking for easy install.
B000MD4YKM|2|Loading the grease gun is fairly easy and it feels durable enough.<br />I used the gun about 4 times to fill up my sway bar end links and stored it away.<br /><br />A month later, I replaced my outer tie rods with ones with zerk fittings so I whipped out this grease gun and noticed that it started to leak everywhere. It leaks a strange yellow oil from the handle and when I tried to use the gun, it just squirted grease from all of the connections even though I tightened them before greasing.<br /><br />I would not recommend this grease gun. Pay a little more for a quality gun that won't leak if you store it for only a month.
B008DWP30Y|5|Stylish and shiny, loved it.
B001AIZ5HY|3|Much better success with the Sylvania kit.
B00PRJI9O8|5|Have not used it yet and hopefully will not use it but it surpasses the usually air pump and flat fix separately ,makes sense all in one . I will review again when used
B000ZRW78Q|5|Ahh the remote. Yes we used it on the evil led off road bar. Works great. Soon all will know the evil pieman16
B00BMX2ROG|5|Awesome.  Way easier to see my brake and signal lights during the day with the LEDs
B000EZW716|5|Arrived as described and in good delivery time. Works as a starter should. No issues with it.
B00FOKOKFM|5|Worked exactly as stated.  Saved us from having to replace the couch - super happy!  Couch looks amazing, my husband couldn't believe it!
B000GU7LK6|5|its oil
B00BEIUHMI|3|The sizing for these helmets run small based on their size charts.  Also because we wear glasses, we couldnt use the sun shade portion which was one of the main reasons we purchased this helmet.  Returned for full refund,  less the shipping
B004VIA0JI|5|Love this thing. I wear this over a Tshirt in order to stay cool but still protected in the summer. Had a bad fall last year while wearing it. If I didn't have this on, arms would have been toasted. Tossed the old one and bought a new one which seems even more improved.
B00094I1SA|4|bought this for my camper and then bought another for my kitchen cabinet in my home. works great.
B00E8TAEZU|5|Reviews on Amazon are not accurate for this gauge.  It does need small O-rings for the 6 connections--but the connectors do not damage your car if placed on and adjusted correctly.  Eric the car guy has a great demo on YouTube.  The case is not horrible--it will last.  Very happy with purchase.
B004B61B34|4|Works well. Took a while to install by myself. recommend removing bumper to make it easier to install.
B00MU3SXJA|2|started peeling first week
B00092893E|5|great product works great
B003OAX5OG|5|Were perfect fit
B00BZDZH2M|5|Great item! Fits, and Looks Perfect!
B00KMEVSGY|3|Easy to install
B00J321CAI|5|great product
B00D8BFJP4|5|Very happy with this purchase! They also sent an American flag sticker, too!  Thank you!!
B000C96EZY|5|The cap and rotor fit my 1988 Toyota 22R perfectly.
B00RP113TE|5|My mechanic replaced my broken fuel pump with this one. It's been doing the job so far.
B00DIGV4MG|3|These seem like a decent product but an installation diagram would be really helpful. I am far from a mechanic and need all the help I can get. Also, they don't seem to retract well and only been in my YJ one day.
B007HRVZVW|5|My fifth wheel is taller than most. Works great
B001AWJCWE|5|I have a pretty short inseam so I ordered these when I got my 05 CBR 600rr. They were super easy to do if you have a buddy with you, but by yourself is a no-go. The bearings are in the links so you just put the bolt right back through them. Doesn't get any easier. 3&#34; in the back is really big difference that just doesn't feel right, but 1&#34; is perfect. Absolutely worth the money and would buy again without question.
B00MX3A3WW|5|Awesome!!!  Easy to install and work great!!!
B000CF5ZE4|5|Fits perfectly for an 02 Subaru WRX. No rewiring or pinning, just pull it out of the box and plug it in. This is for the down stream, or after the turbo and I used it with my Godspeed downpipe I got off amazon for a 100 bucks.
B00NHY745A|5|Its a Oil Change Kit, makes things a lot eaiser and getting it on Amazon was much cheaper.
B000BYEOIY|5|very good plug
B00LX28WAO|5|Fantastic set of lights!! Night Fishing has never been quieter (except for the noisy guys nearby with generators powering halogen lights). These are bright, very adjustable and so far seem to stand up to the ocean salt air.
B000CAINDE|4|works great so far.cant beat the price either
B00504R7JS|5|Good quality.  Was a gift.
B00DVWK7YI|5|Made in Iowa, that was a nice surprise! :)
B00KEZWVYY|4|nice
B00QXSXN5M|1|too small for my sonata 2012
B00O9EUX1O|4|They are not a deep yellow.
B00MH4663C|5|A small compact seemingly well built unit.  I tested it.  It delivered over 200A for 3 seconds staying above 10VDC.  Amazing.  If you can't start with that across a week main battery, you have other problems with our car.
B0002STSQM|4|Made in USA, all metal parts, scale marks are bigger and more visible than competitors. Happy.
B001GJ3FIS|4|Items are just what I had ordered.  Work fine for a cheap sprayer.  :)<br />Your not spending a lot of money on this, but its seems well worth the $5 and change!  I bought two, both work just fine!
B00FKOIY2C|5|Very nice
B0060YHLHU|5|great
B000OE80PY|5|Covers well, haven't seen how it holds up for full winter season though. I has extra ties to tighten so that is handy since its a little baggy/ big for our pop-up.
B00K889FCI|3|Seemed to work pretty well.
B002EO8LGK|4|Used this for a 2006 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 and have had it on for a year now. It is less stiff than the OEM clutch. I do hear a slight whistle, kind of like a bearing sound which I assume is the throw out bearing. I've seen other reviews where you have to make sure they put a little grease on the input shaft before applying the bearing which I really hope my mechanic did, if he did than this sound might be normal, if not, than I hope I don't have to replace this again but it wouldn't be Exedy's fault. I really like the feel of the clutch though.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Great service,Nice product!
B00DD1019I|1|I am not sure how this product has received 4.5 stars, as the mats are definitely NOT heavy duty!!  We purchased these mats approximately 2-3 months ago.  We purchased them based on the reviews and the &#34;Heavy Duty Solid Rubber&#34; description, as we WANT and NEED heavy duty mats, but they already have holes in them. So, on July 24th I sent an email to Custom Auto Crews, to which they responded to on July 25th asking for a picture, to which I sent on July 26th, to which Custom Auto Crews NEVER responded.  I then sent another email to them on July 29th and asked if they had received my previous email with the picture included, to which Custom Auto Crews NEVER responded.  SO, here we are with overly priced, cheaply made mats, but I guess the good news is that they at least have &#34;breathability&#34;!!
B0095TC6I6|5|Best clip on mirrors you can get! Buy them you won't be disappointed!
B00HV1VAI2|5|Easy to install before they shipped them the company call me about my truck and custom cut them for me at no extra cost there look great on my truck again thanks
B00LHT3G54|5|Fix great
B00KN0UOEE|5|Works great on my pontoon cushions, makes them look much nicer.
B00JGJH8QU|4|Works as described, does make sure that the sites are wired correctly, thats a big PLUS!
B002NF0OD8|4|replacement mount clips would be useful as they usually break when you remove the old cable as they become brittle - if they were not broken already
B0031BJ1NC|3|Installed this stand on a KTM 250 EXC. Good design and easy installation. The only problem is that it is a little long and stands the bike almost straight up. If not on the correct surface and have the handle bars turned correctly, it wants to tip away from the stand.
B000OZXLQ6|5|fits nice on the john deere
B000BYB41E|5|Excellent
B00VNBDWPK|5|I like them.  I needed an adapter cable, but it was already included in the box.  Easy install.
B000JZB66S|5|fits and works fine on a mercury cougar 2.5 year 98.5
B005ZGJ906|5|Exactly what I expected.
B002X1PNRY|1|Did not work on my vehicle. Had to buy the mfg part
B00JF53ZEE|5|Great sturdy build. I bought for my 2010 honda civic for road trips that require that extra space. This fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can only hold about 150-200 lbs on this, but that's not the fault of the product, but rather having a compact car.
B000KTX288|5|High quality product; easy to use.  I like the color too.
B002VFAOEO|5|First called the shop to see how much they wanted, between $400 to $500 was their estimate over the phone to replace this blower.<br />Then went to youtube to see if I could replace it my self, yep, it's actually quite easy to do, a few screws and some pop off panels and 1 power plug. Took me 15 minutes and trust me, if I can do it...anyone can do it.<br />I spent $51.99 on this item and took 4 days to get here with standard shipping, as for the performance of this blower, I can not tell the difference between the old one when it worked and the new one....none what so ever, I'd give this item 10 stars if I could.
B00A4VVI38|5|License plate was great
B004I0IEP6|5|Works. Tricky to get in
B00BJMXKM8|5|Solved our Tach issues.
B00EUID7WG|5|fits perfectly...
B000FW2NU8|3|Too small.  Not enough leverage.
B00T7CRL0E|5|I use it on my office chair and it fits great! Comfortable and well worth the cost.
B007XZK8NY|5|lowered my car...and the look is very cool.
B00G5OVLIA|5|The switch was everything the description said it was and more !  Satisfied with product...
B00EDY7DUY|2|Quality was ok. It was not as good as I had predicted and the small outline tore during the process of putting it on.
B00C8HY1JY|4|they wixed my misfire and fit without any issues
B000OUZYAW|5|Bought this as a gift for our son. Looks great. So far, so good.
B00K8BN8QO|5|original
B0071I344I|3|It does not come with the wiring.
B00ANZW7G2|5|Has held up well after several washes.
B0016OMRAK|5|Great tailgate for 5th wheel.
B007137D2W|5|Perfect solution, and looks like it will outlast the rest of the vehicle by a significant margin.<br />Seems MUCH better than the original part.
B00B9EXTC2|5|PERFECT FIT
B006A49J02|5|After some homework and research about what oil to get for my VW 2013 Passat TDI SE this turned to be the best and right choice. It is VW 504 00/507 00 compatible and for the quality and the price is the oil you need for your diesel car. Very pleased with this purchase.
B00HR07TIC|5|Excellent mount for my application. Plan to use it to hold my Lowrance GPS on the gunwale of a fiberglass boat where a suction cup mount will not work.
B005P5DNH2|4|Did not fit snug to body
B0000AY2Z6|5|Nicely made, air movement good++
B005J1UK2I|5|Installed four of these on a 26' Keystone toy hauler; work great and were easy to install.  I don't understand what all of the issues are in other reviews that claim either (1) the supplied bolts are no good, or (2) the recommended hole size is wrong. The instructions clearly state drilling an 11/32&#34; hole - this is exactly the right size for these bolts. Numerous reviews suggest drilling and using bolts with nuts and washers - this is probably not a good idea. If you do happen to hit something with one of these jacks it would be better to pull the bolt out (i.e. tear the jack off the frame) than it would be to bend the trailer frame. If the jacks are bolted on with nuts on the back side, it is far more likely you'll bend the trailer frame.  As the instructions state, two bolts per jack should be sufficient - one bolt on each side of the mounting plate.  The bolts are there simply to keep the jack attached when retracted, all of the force is through the frame when extended.
B00T6JKMBI|5|Worked perfectly!<br />Thanks!
B0083WO48Q|5|My elderly uncle loved this chair at the beach. did not crowd his hips and the table was a nice add. Very light weight.
B00BH1940I|5|These look great on my 66 fastback
B000BZGKCG|5|Nice
B00J21ND0M|3|Bought this for a 94 miata m edition and it doesn't quite line up with the holes on my quick release or the steering wheel itself. Wasn't broken or anything so that's good but hey you get what you pay for...
B007D3YI64|4|great addition to my bike
B002P8IJAI|4|Super fast delivery, It fit perfectly, can't beat the price!!!!
B00ZDHCAS0|5|Works great
B00S4QSNQ0|5|love it
B000FPYAGK|2|Rear wiper arm not the front
B00GIBEZU6|5|Just as I expected. Nice that they also include the tool for removal and install.
B005HAYDR4|4|Great price and they look great on my Jeep
B00RNDOQSO|5|Good price, good fit, easy to install
B000850MZK|4|I like the load cell idea, but some caliper designs require removal and some creativity to use this tool.
B00DSD4T5I|5|I told my son I ordered this for him. We got it in the mail today,when I showed him he said &#34;yay kitty&#34;. It looks just like it should and I can't wait to put it in the car!!
B0002SQYV4|5|Great Product !!.. Looks great on all of our vehicle's...
B00230CAOO|5|Awesome coil for retrofit or repair
B001DRP9WS|5|Good
B00NRVAAIG|5|i order h7 5000k<br />and it's very shine .
B0000AY2Z6|4|A portable version of the high quality roof fans made for RVs; the reason for the high price. Don't expect extreme cooling.
B00S0LSXQO|5|This purchase worked out nicely!
B00DR67P9I|5|I love these little guys. I am using them for landscaping lights. They work perfect and saved me thousands. Price led landscape lighting and you will know what I mean. I also have them on my four wheeler for side lights. They can put off a blinding light. would make great low profile reverse lights on a vehicle.
B000GZMDHW|3|Honda Shadow Spirit 2008. Brake makes squeaking noise after using for a while. First time using this brand and because of the review other wrote to make me bought this one. Don't know how long it will last but for sure will not buy it again.
B00X5FP7J6|1|Thought this was the key less remote for my car, but It was just the plastic shell/case.. I knew that I would have to pay to have the key programmed for my car, but I was not expecting just a plastic case with nothing in it.. Make sure this is what you want before you order it. And, it's mailed from China so I can't send it back..
B00BITIM0W|5|Fast shipping, great quality
B00SUNHB7Y|5|Awesome kit, everything I could want in a lighting kit. Easy installation and I'm not restricted to one color. I can change colors with the push of a button.
B0016KA8KA|5|We bought this for our new camper trailer and it worked great!!
B000C59WBQ|5|You will have to install the grease fitting and the hole is not threaded. Not much trouble to use the fitting to cut the threads but getting it started can make you say some new words. The ball/head is larger than OEM but the tapper shank is direct fit, this must be a problem they solved (hints problem solver). The larger ball must provide more surface and some other stuff, just remember to pack it with grease after installing it.<br />If you are doing what I did and bought Tie Rod End boots to replace the rubber style with poly then you need to get these and measure first. Energy Suspension part 9.13102R does not fit. Even though they would fit my OEM rods.
B00WZT1LDY|1|Shorted out when they got wet and would no longer respond to remote. This after only one day.
B007TY96CI|5|fit right in & quick delivery .....will order more items from this company ..... Awesome!!!!!!!
B00JW1W4ZC|4|Looked up prices comparing OReilly, Autozone, and Amazon.  This same part is a midprice part at Oreilly costing $40 more.  So although it was the cheapest option on Amazon, it is not truly the cheapest option in the industry. Just a very solid price for a mid line product.  Upper end product would be the OEM motorcraft part, really as long as this one works no reason to pay $130 for that.<br /><br />Installation was simple, just a word of advice. After you install the new part and try to see if your new part works.  Make sure you start the vehicle.  Thought that I really screwed something up, only emergency flashers worked.  Then started the vehicle and everything worked.<br /><br />Installed on 2000 Ford Ranger.  Box said multi switch fit 1999 - 2004 Ford Ranger.
B00HRH9H9O|5|Just got mine and to my surprise it had a hole cut out for the Nissan emblem and had the word Nissan etched on the back
B002Y31IGG|5|Applied without a hitch!
B002FY7S72|1|When I found out how much Chevy wanted for a new light, I about cried. When I found this one online I thought I was in heaven. I was so wrong!  The light came broken. The bevels that are attached to the adjuster were busted. There was no way to fix it.  The seller wanted me to take pictures of the damage. Anyone who knows this product knows that is impossible to take a picture of the INSIDE of the light.  DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT!!! It is not worth the hassle!!
B00L7WV054|5|A Perfect Pin-Up, she's classy enough to be displayed without feeling dirty. I turned mine into a magnet by sticking it to a magnetic sheet now I can move her around my toolbox.
B006UH6BPU|1|Who sells only one shoe, or one earing? Well, apparently shadow industries does because I received only one of their buddys. Maybe they figured I would protect one hub one month and swap it out the next month. Nowhere does it say that these are sold as a pair, but it doesnt say they are sold individually EITHER. I guess I assumed and now its made an ass out of you and me.
B002E5DT2A|4|wasn't easy to install. took some tries  to wiggle it in.
B003KFR1HM|3|This mounting kit was a pain to install according to my mechanic at the shop for a Hyundai Sonata.  The kit could use some redesigning to get everything properly aligned better for quicker installation.  I'm glad I didn't attempt this at home, as it one mechanic with all the good tools and the car on the lift 4 hrs to install the new struts and shocks and the front mounting kits was one of the biggest time consumer.
B00FSC5A8C|5|Works perfect
B000HEBR3I|1|This product is not reliable at all. I have purchased this 2 times and stopped working each time after a couple months. The on/off trigger is poorly designed
B000RFUF12|5|Works perfect!  Do not try to fill your batteries without this!
B0042Z0XWY|5|Great, just as pictured and described, it comes with a key chain wrench so you can secure to prevent theft or backing off while riding down the roaf
B002HY06GK|5|I am satisfied,,,,Thank you
B0043SCBD4|5|Exellent product
B000JZZC72|5|As many people like to say, wix is of great quality.<br /><br />Seems to be working great.
B000C7YAWA|5|Received in perfect condition and installed in 10 minutes! Seems to be working just fine, eliminated a bothersome surge & hesitation in my Tundra's uphill acceleration.
B000NWA8HU|5|A snap to install, literally.  Snap off dash bezel, pop this unit out; three release tabs, disconnect plug, and then do the reverse.  Replaced other DIC modules before on steering wheel, and all lit up as they were originally.  But I can't recall if two icons for roller dimmer, above and below, are supposed to be backlit?  All of these DIC modules work fine, but all the backlighting failed, which is annoying to have a blacked out dash.  Heater/AC unit is next, as all lights are out.  8/7/15 - after tearing apart the old unit, there is no lighting for the icons above and below the roller wheel dimmer switch; only lighting for the dial switch and icons to the left.  The bulb in the old unit was completely fried.
B000BOAZM8|5|Good price for a quality product with prompt delivery. Will buy from them again.
B00BMZU90I|5|Ordered and came straight away. Shipped to CA which has been a problem, but put it on this weekend in about 3 hours. Mostly because I had tough time getting power steering pump off. Fit like a champ, gasket was fine, connector to the exhaust pipe was fine, sounds brand new again. Good buy and hundreds cheaper than the local dealer.
B000AS3D3I|5|Quality filter for my f250
B00957S5B0|2|First item had damages from carbon bubbles. Returned it in person. Tried about 5 different ones before i found that seemed to fit and had minimal carbon bubbles. Took it to a shop, and the shop did not know it was only 90% fit until they installed it via tape. Seller does not accept exchange or return after tape install. Carbon quality is wavey and poor. Better off just spending extra for OEM. Will post waviness of carbon quality if amazon lets me later. If you don't care about quality, definitely go with non OEM.
B00W4HGD3A|1|Worst Marine Corp sticker I've ever seen!  The one's you can get at the Recruiting office are a million times better and they are free!!!
B00I5HRG02|5|Nice strap and a steal at under $10. Can't go wrong here!
B00OAJ5WT6|5|Strong, easy to install, look good, fit perfect with no alterations.Good price, well packaged for shipment...
B000FW4M4S|1|Broke the first time I used it for condo window washing. Don't buy this.
B00VU7KNDG|5|I own a 4x4 specialties shop, I love supreme suspensions quality and price.
B00080QHMM|5|Bpught for wife,, easy to use , highly recommend yo all for glove box must have item.
B001GMWZ90|5|Vary easy install 6 bolts 6 washers pops right on!
B001G4S8C6|5|The fit hitch securely and was great for our camping trip.
B001DDULKC|5|one of the best riding gear i ever get
B00CCIM1YQ|1|rubber &#34;accordion&#34; pieces have already dry-rotted, after only a couple of months of use...will take it up with the manufacturer since I am outside my amazon return policy
B0002SQVNA|5|Easy to use. Works well
B00332GMPY|5|I bought these for my Ford Ranger XLT.  I took out the old plastic bed liner since a six foot table would not fit in with the liner.<br /><br />These fit perfectly and aligned with the holes in the side.  I cleaned the truck bed rails and wiped the top with paint thinner afterward to get off any wax.  My wife and I aligned them and placed them in position.  They had a little give at first.  After a couple of hours they were holding very well with no movement.<br /><br />The truck looks a lot better.  I do not have to remove the bed liner every time I get six foot tables.
B006DDHZ1K|5|Once you get the old spark plugs out, these fit perfect. My truck had 160,000 miles on it and 7 out of 8 of the plugs broke off in the cylinders, these work great. Still mad at Ford for making such a piece of crap. I strongly recommend replacing at about 40,000 miles and I don't think you'll break any plugs.
B00ZC20NUS|5|The gauge arrived quickly, and I immediately went and tested my tires. It works great and feels like a quality product. Will definitely be getting another for the wife. If I could only get her to use it now...
B007NZ719S|2|They do the job,but it might be a bit stiff for someone looking for a more comfortable ride.  After 5000 KM,the ones in the back are worn out...I thought they would last more than that.  You get what you pay for.
B007KTINZI|5|a good price
B00BHT7AT2|2|I bought this model specifically because it had Western Europe maps.  I was very disappointed with the product. After fully charging the unit, I was never able to call up any screens since it did not recognize any touch. I boxed it up for a return and refund.  While priced reasonably, the unit was not a good representation of Garmin's usual quality.
B00AWRLQ90|5|No more buying filters ! shot of brake clean and you're good to go
B00FV17VJQ|5|Love it!
B00VO035ZW|5|Easy to install. So far so good!
B000CSW5VW|5|Great for price
B0007VANJK|5|Great hitch receiver, comes with the necessary bolts to attach it and directions for how it should go. Installed easily with just one person onto my tacoma.
B004UPZXI0|3|First CG product I haven't been satisfied with.  It streaked and smeared no matter how I tried to avoid it.  Bought a lot of CG stuff in the past, and will continue to do so, but for a spray wax I am really digging the Meguiars D156 in the gallon.
B006X6N2LE|4|it's ok ... looks better on the pc.
B001KSEE62|3|The o-ring in the base of the regulator does not fit in the hole of the fuel rail on my 2002 Isuzu Rodeo V6. I hope it does not cause any problems.
B0085XH58O|2|This was a sticker to be placed on the accompanying plastic piece for the car.  I don't recall seeing this in the description nor in the reviews.  I decided not to mess with a sticker, mainly for worry of not getting the sticker on straight.  Decided that since I own an expensive car, then I'll pay for an original emblem.  I returned the item.
B00CNXMUL4|1|The visor clip is very poor quality.  I received it in the mail yesterday.  I immediately put it in my new car.  When I got into my car after work today, the angel had fallen off the clip and was on the seat.  The angel is beautiful but the quality is lacking.  Beware.
B00ARJNR7M|5|Great price and fast delivery. Fixed a long standing problem on my 99 GMC Sierra. Local shops were blaming abs module or pump---very expensive replacements. Swapped out sensor that was not functioning and all problems went away. Try this first if you an ABS light. Reived two as shown and kept one for a spare.
B00O9YVVME|5|excellent
B00NFA4OBS|4|They look great, very bright. The mounting tape that came with them is not strong enough to hold the small ballast boxes and they did not come with a mounting bracket so you have to use extra zip ties and be creative on how you will secure them. They came USPS mail the box was squeezed it to a priority envelop and when the arrived I was really worried they were broken, they were in the shown box with NO packing material around them, so they shook around in the box. I hope it didn't kill the life of the bulb.
B00P2D41OQ|5|Worked great and is def brighter than OEM.
B00ITAIUBY|4|Works great
B0010E00T6|5|It's nice and strong
B0085XV9JA|5|I'm satisfied
B00NGEDGTE|3|I really like it, and it looks great on my car, but when I got it, there was a letter missing in it. Really disappointed that I didn't get good quality.
B00GOZB17G|5|Good spring. Stainless spring with chrome plated brass end pieces. Screw/stud is removable/replaceable. Spring is slightly bent and antenna will be crooked, but if you garb the base of the antenna and the spring and bend it, it can be straightened. Firestik spring are the same.  With a 4 foot Firestik Firefly antenna attached the spring bends about 10 degrees at 75 mph. When the vehicle stops, the antenna returns to the vertical position.     .
B00O4G1OYW|5|Very nice leather key chain.  Had my initials inscribed.  Nice touch to start my Fathers Day gift.
B0024B1A3Y|5|Great deal! The AC's magnetic clutch went bad on my 2004 Toyota Sienna so my mechanic used the clutch off this Denso compressor and it worked great. Now I have a spare compressor in case that ever goes bad.
B006WBHIF6|5|I spent a long time looking at non-OEM roof rack systems and eventually decided that because of the small price difference, I might as well go with the OEM product. I'm extremely glad that I did – if you're considering this, go with the VW OEM rack and you won't be disappointed. There's not much space on the roof of a Jetta to which any 'ol rack can latch on and grip tightly, and these are designed exactly for this car, so you know it'll be secure.<br /><br />I have a Mk6 Jetta, and these fit quite snugly. There are &#34;specially-reinforced areas,&#34; as the manual for this product says, for the roof rack to be attached to the roof of the vehicle. The installation process is simple but took me about fifteen minutes, and the required torque wrench is included.<br /><br />Since these bars are not standard square or round bars, if you want to add cargo carriers, bike racks, kayak racks, etc., to these, you'll probably need to either buy VW's proprietary add-ons or jerry-rig something of your own: these are designed such that the attachment racks slide into the channels on each of the base racks, widthwise on the car; I bought a cheap bike rack ([[ASIN:B008PHJZEC TMS® 2 X Aluminum Upright CAR Rooftop Folding Bicycle Rack Carrier Suv (For 2 Bikes)]]) designed for use on square bars and slid pairs of square M6 bolts with large fender washers (probably would be better with M7 or M8 bolts but I had limited options at the time) into this base rack's slots, sticking up, then attached my bike rack to them. This is far sturdier than simply gripping onto or sliding over your standard square or metal bars, and I don't have to pay VW for their fancy bike rack.
B002GTKAHQ|5|I'm very happy with my purchase!!<br />I recommend them! Not only is a must have for safety but very sexy!!
B00965DD2C|5|Installed my self. Came with instructions, shifter,shifter housing, and hard wear. Only thing that it didn't come with is the shift know it self (TRD shift knob) and the Orange TRV seal that toyota recommends to use to seal the shifter housing to the transmission. Luckily for me, the dealer shift was right down my street and it only cost me $7. Performance wise, yeah it's worth it and it's day and night deference
B001TXWNLQ|1|It doesn't work! however it is too cheap to return!
B00ICNWBOK|4|I ORDRED THE PARTS AND THEY CAME IN 2 DAYS BUT FOUND OUT THEY WERE THE WRONG ONES SO I CALLED AND WITHIN TWO DAYS I HAD THE RIGHTS ONES DELIVERED  IT WAS SO EASY TO FIX AND I RETURNED THE WRONG ONE  THANK YOU
B000F6DNMQ|4|Pretty good product! Your grill wont get dirty,
B002H8S80C|5|SWEET!!!!
B00YVC3W12|2|Wasn't heavy enough to sit (and not move) on dash. Did a lot of sliding around, finally falling to the floor. Fortunately, the phone wasn't damaged, but I don't use it anymore.
B007TYQ6JE|5|Fits my 03 Tacoma perfectly and was 1/3 the cost of the OEM unit.
B001KKTJ4W|5|Fits as expected and is a great helmet.
B001LQPDA4|5|These horns are LOUD!!!
B00PLCVQHI|4|Great product. I didn't give it 5 stars because the elastic loops are already stretched out after just one use. Also, it is very hard to get an iPad in a case into the holder.
B00VGL7DX4|5|ask for both seal sizes if youre not sure, they will send free. great quality too!
B000CSC65M|3|never installed. I do not know if these are good or not
B0087NAZM0|5|Love the product.  Just have to get use to it.
B00ZC20NUS|5|This is a very cool product. I love the large LED screen on it to give you your reading, makes life so much easier. The best thing though I love about this product is the seat belt cutter. How many of us really have these in our vehicles? With this product you can ensure you are always safe now as you never know when you'll need one. So happy I bought this!!!!!
B00USDNWVI|5|looks good on yellow. excelant fit.
B000QFVJ5O|4|Heavy duty for mc use, but sometimes overkill is a good thing.
B003RVWKH0|5|Key fob arrived quickly. Directions were straightforward. Worked like a charm!
B00P1KZJAK|5|Good product
B001EAQTRI|5|This was just as advertised. I plugged this into the center console on my 2008 Rav4 and it immediately stopped the static/hum noise I was hearing. I didn't notice any volume loss either.<br /><br />I have this bluetooth dongle http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NLTW60 plugged in to the ground loop isolator and the isolator plugged in to the Aux-in port. Together I get the benefits of bluetooth streaming without having to install a new deck.
B000WK718C|5|Great
B008FZD05O|1|Poorly made, not the same as pictured. Maybe good for a one time use.
B003M91I34|5|I've been looking for a jacket that would work for both mild winter and hot summer riding. I commute in LA. I bought this hoping it would compare favorably with many much more expensive jackets I've tried. Frankly I think it's better. The armor is effective but unobtrusive. It is nicely visible. Best of all, the venting is extremely effective. With the liner out it is comfortable on our hottest Los Angeles days and I have no question that with the liner in it will be just as effective during our cool, but not cold, winters.
B00B2ABP9W|5|great kit. Fit my truck perfectly with zero issues.
B000E4KO94|5|Mine fit fine.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|The answer to keeping my car clean. I love this thing. My boyfriend has a nasty habit of just throwing wrappers and empty bottles in the back of my car. Now he has a place to throw them so everything looks nice and tidy and it makes it so easy to empty the trash when I'm filling up my gas tank. The only con is that I think the trash part could be a bit bigger.<br /><br />I also love the kleenex holder. I had a kleenex box in the back of my car, and it just slowly got destroyed as we'd pile things into the car. This keeps in place, is easy to reach so we don't have to hunt for the box.
B0077RU1XU|5|Bought for our 2015 Jeep Cherokee because our Thule cross bars wouldn't work and these are fantastic! Holds our Thule cargo carrier and looks great! For the price we were very surprise at the quality!
B00LXKYA0C|5|nice and works as advertised
B00DJBQ1SW|3|Loved them, they were great, they helped a lot. You might consider selling a dolly package for the moving costumers.
B00KGIDGG6|5|Worked perfectly
B00DCO0E1Q|4|Looked great but these are for the REAR CV joints! The front CV joints are SurTrack SB-8040
B0009IQZH0|5|Good product !
B001AY2WLU|5|Wanted to have a multi-purpose tool in my glove box & this is perfect. It has many of the tools I think we'll use & you can't beat the price. Also, fast delivery thanks to Amazon Prime.
B00X2TUW1I|5|great for my SUV!
B000C81U3Q|1|After attaching brand-new expensive Bosch ignition wires to this coil, and attaching these brand-new wires to brand-new plugs, I discovered, hunched over at the back of the engine, that they didn't bother to drill the mounting hole through the back - you know, so I could actually mount it to the motor.  Had to pull it out and broke my coolant line in the process.  Fortunately Amazon remedied the situation.  Maybe I got a bad one, but check that the mounting hole is drilled through as soon as you get it.  SMP usually ships out a good product.  This one, not so much.
B00SHZK820|4|They fit OK, not perfect, but at least I'm not in danger of smashing my finger or hands anymore.
B004GN5MZK|5|Installed same day I received them and they are BRIGHT!!!! Installed them in a 06 Lexus GS300 and they are better than the OEM bulbs. Would def buy again!!!
B004BFUQF4|2|Maybe it's unfair that I'm giving it two stars because I bought it to get some old bumper stickers off my car and it didn't do anything. It also completely lost the orange color in a day or two from sitting in my hot car.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It was a very well made product. It did a great job of blocking the sun on the dashboard. I am very happy that my driving experience has been enhanced!
B003CN72LW|3|There was nothing wrong with bulb itself, however three of the bulbs were broke when we recieved them.
B00G9W95IQ|5|Wow this thing is tough. It compresses just like the product image shows. Attached is the pic of my Teton Sports +20 sleeping bag, before and after pulling the straps on this bag.<br /><br />Update for more info: To specify, I bought the small compression bag. I also have a Teton Sports +5 degree sleeping bag, and it can barely stuff into the small sack, and there isn't much compression left to be done at that point. So if you have a warmer sleeping bag, I'd recommend a medium to be safe. You can always stuff your clothes in if you have extra room. I primarily use this for my backpacking clothing at this point, and it is perfect for that use.
B002E2WMWG|5|Although not the same bulb (I got a 9006) for another truck, they made the fog lights functional.  I'm not one of those idiots that drive around town with their driving/fog lights on all the time, but use them when it's raining, foggy or right after a rain at night when the wet road is super reflective.  They are also bright enough by themselves to use rolling up the dirt road to my hunting blind and I want to be stealthy.  I'm picking up a pair for my new truck driving/fog lights.  I had them on the old truck for 1-1/2 years before I sold it, so I expect them to last.
B008LXULV6|3|I had to send this back to Antigravity after we found a dry cell which cracked the bottom of the battery. Going through their warranty was not too bad but it took some convincing. When I got the replacement unit it worked great for my 12v 1976 honda 360cc bike. really lightweight I just strapped it with rubber tie down under my seat.
B00796UQHA|3|I have one of these antennas, depending on the area your in it may or may not give you good reception.<br /><br />Here's the thing folks.... NO short FM antenna will give you as good a reception as your OEM. If you shorten the length of a FM antenna, your reception will decrease. PERIOD! So don't but a shorty antenna and expect it to have the same performance as an OEM. It won't. NO ones will!<br /><br />This antenna though does make a good replacement for your OEM if you aren't into AM/FM radio. This antenna is NOT used for XM/Sirus radio. If your off roading in the back country, consider satellite radio, or using the AUX input, or even your CD/MP3 player.<br /><br />Fit: if you have an older Xterra, (pre 2010) it may or may not fit.
B011ALDA6I|4|on time delivery, parts as described
B009LP4D3K|3|The Visor was fine but not for my model & year. It didn't fit.
B000ONZT5E|5|Worked out great for my baja bug...
B0007UQ2N2|5|I purchased this purely for potable water. Filled water barrels for emergency drinking water. Has worked fine and doesn't kink.
B006M4AOCC|5|These mats fit well. Good quality. Little thinner than expected but not a problem. Easy to take out and replace.
B0014H7LQY|5|Loved it!  I bought it to cover my seat due to dog hair.  It worked perfectly.
B0054HNQ32|5|Rings work great.  I used them to secure ATVs and they never move when tied down using these rings!!
B0002L6OIE|3|Ok
B0048FRJ7A|5|Good quality and excellent fit for 2012 BMW X5.
B007Y5BXYG|5|This is the best fitting windshield shade that I have found to date.  It has near complete coverage and is well insulated.  It is bigger than most - due to sturdy build.  This is a good buy.
B007BL4WPA|5|Perfect fit
B00KTJ1PLU|1|didnt work on my 2003 crown vic ( police Inter).. beware I call to get a new .. but no answer ...
B00092893E|5|Loved this product very much.  It cleaned my engine well so I can have a smooth driving.
B003EDY4GG|4|fits good on the plugs
B008BL0C76|5|Excellent product. Fits perfectly on my 4Runner
B00Y1HQJLW|5|Perfect
B00KGIBXZM|5|We've yet to take it out on the lake since installing, but it runs in the yard!!  YAY!  Had the old one rebuilt after seeing the cost of OEM and that didn't last long. HOpefully this is the cost effective solution it appears to be.
B000BZ54MI|5|Great fit for the 2005 Prius.  Easy to install.  Car works good as new again.
B004R35MQI|5|Sturdy and heavy rack. Nice for the sub $100 price. Was missing the lock pin.
B00QCHBQL2|5|Good product
B0002JMFKM|5|Bright red dye. Small can. Just what I wanted.
B000BUQOBS|4|Works fine.
B004I12438|5|I've had to replace both on my van now.  Both fit perfectly and just worked.
B009MC124K|5|THESE MIRRORS ARE LONGER AND ALLOW YOU TO SEE MUCH MORE OF THE AREA IN THE BACK OF A SUV AND ON THE BACK SIDES
B001GS0DCU|4|the front fits fine had to shave down the back so they will fit better but they still slide down even with the  2 sided tape
B00429NKWK|5|This kit did magic to my 13-year old Honda Civic headlights, they look like new. Worth every penny, if you follow the instructions.
B001DCC20U|5|Exact fit for my car, well built.
B0023ASVCO|2|The headlights that I ordered were an exact fit for my Trailblazer. The installation was simple and easy. I am pleased with the quality of this product.<br />They made a huge improvement in driving at night.
B00HFX208U|4|Worked perfectly well on my new wheel for my 2010 Honda CRV LX.
B00MWHR9OY|5|excellent product !!!!! thoroughly recommended ..<br />I put on my tiida Nissan (no hb) 2014 ...<br />the trouble is that it takes off soon but I did rivet at the bottom so it does not look bad ...
B00FANQXA8|4|Well made, replaced an old snap-on unit, coiled chord better to work with
B0028OL9CY|4|Great valve for the money doing exactly what it should do.
B00ELR402W|5|Fit properly and worked like the original - well better- (the original quit working) These work great!
B00CZEZNGU|5|Works perfectly good product
B004QHLG4W|5|works and fit fine
B00KBBL4H6|5|This is by far the best tire gauge I've ever used, and I have used quite a few. Typically they are unreliable and difficult to read. This is user-friendly and has been excellent. Readings have been consistent, unlike less expensive gauges I've used. I highly recommend, especially if your car has a highly sensitive tire pressure monitor system as mine seems to have.
B00SXZDKTW|4|Gives temp and voltage seems to give accurate readings.
B00EAJTW6A|3|neve had one loosen up out of 1000s of oil filters i changed but this one did<br />me or the filter  me i guess..........
B0032H8N2U|5|Very convenient tonneau cover. I love that I can fold it back and remove it by myself if I need to
B009DJK04K|5|Working very good!
B004OFNJZ0|4|I like them except they're too small...........I bought the regular size instead of the jumbo for my 1996 Camry.  They're very nice and thick, and unlike the very thin, worthless jumbo ones I got after I bought these.  Same company made both and there's a world of difference so one must be aware.
B001MXX5D8|4|My husband thinks Mothers is one of the best products on the market for detailing his cars.
B009DJQWX8|5|Good
B001IWL1O8|4|Well made manual transmission fluid for your Honda.
B00COYNUCU|5|Kids sized. Fits my toddler perfectly.
B00GGMKOIE|5|Very nice tight fit. Looks great my wife and I are very pleased.
B000W3RU9Y|4|These are seriously heavy duty. You don't need any more bungee than these can give you.
B000NCI854|4|Going by what Hubby says only...He really likes it well especially the Quick Start.....
B000CODEWU|5|Good
B002VFWTDS|5|As advertised
B00BUQMQYQ|5|Fit perfect
B005FWWUNS|1|Crap
B007KP0GOI|5|We received this product and it works great and is everything we were hoping for. Thanks for a great product.
B000C9GYOA|2|Burned up after a month.....
B005CJ0824|5|So far so good for my 2012 WRX.  I used Totsubo brackets so I didn't have to drill holes in my front bumper.  Works great!  Also added some easily removable dark paint on the rubber bumper, so if anyone feels the need to bump and run, it will leave a nice mark on the other car.  I'll have to keep adding paint, but worth the work for these idiots in Philly that can't parallel park.<br /><br />You can also remove the rubber bumper as another option so it becomes your metal on his/her bumper (I've been bumped more than my fair share if you can't tell).
B0067UJMD8|5|Works great! Good quality!
B0000CBILL|5|Love this item,
B000F6F99G|5|Easy to install and really helps with parking in our garage. It's a bit of a tight fit, it really relieves the stress!
B005X7P6XG|3|Does not fit correctly in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ. It is too big about 1/8&#34; all the way around (1/4&#34; overall width and height)
B00PXC5PNC|2|Great concept and it seems to work for other people, but it would not install for us without leaving a gap. Unfortunately I didn't get to the return before the time expired. A waste and lesson learned I guess.
B00SXMKKMK|5|Very fast shipping. It just took 2 days. I use it to erase my oil change and MAF sensor light. Easy to use and save me $100 for the auto shop. Everybody should have one. It save you a lot of money.
B00YWD58JO|5|Excellet product, pretty expensive tho.
B007GR5A7I|5|Son LOVES this!
B000VBCCEU|1|Didn't fit properly
B00TQQVJFO|3|The chain itself was awesome! It felt very sturdy and looked very nice. I bought this for my 2000 scrambler, however the chain only came with 74 links, therefore it was too short for my ATV and i ended up returning it..
B003DNL8ZC|2|The cover didn't last long.<br /><br />I bought it in March, and after less than 6 months the fabric is totally worn out, I guess by the sun (I live in California and we didn't get much rain lately...), I don't think is for outdoor use.<br /><br />It is cheap, but again, if you have to buy a couple of them every year, probably I am better off with something more expensive but more durable.
B004GBEHSK|4|It fit but a little tight
B00VIVAE10|5|This is an amazing decal. it looks great and is a good size not too big but not too small. easy to put on, if you don't know how just go to YouTube to see how people put vinyl decals, and it looks great on my truck. will definitely order more designs later. came fast via letter envelope on account of the size of the item so you wont be able to track it but know that it will be there shortly. overall a great product at an amazing price.
B00I0I4DMA|1|Cheaply made, feels like a death trap in my hand definitely a knock off of zippo first and last time I buy a lighter that was marked as a zippo that isn't sold by zippo. Love the case I took the chimney and stuff out of my real zippo and out it inside this. But that is the only way I trust it . The one out of this was so Chinese built I can tell by weight and the wick . The balls inside are just cotton and the end isn't as thick as a zippo just over all not impressed with the exception of the case. So if you buy this I would also buy a real zippo and use the lighter part of that in this especially if you love your eyebrows. Sorry seller to dis this but I spent money on a zippo not some Chinese pos . Find a pink Floyd lighter by zippo I don't want someone else ripped off.
B0002KKIJQ|5|I prefer Berrryman tire sealer over green slime. This is the second gallon I have purchased for use in my lawn business. I have a fleet of riding mowers and trailers. Well worth the price in the gallon bottle.
B00PGRGHKY|5|Perfect fit very good quality right to your door.
B00042KGMG|5|Wow, this Hi-Lift Jack is built like a tank!  Built bigger & heavier than our old 48&#34; jack which has served us well for many decades.  If your in need of a heavy duty Hi-Lift Jack, look no farther because this jack is a beast!!!<br /><br />Every shop should be equipped with this jack ... no questions about it ... you won't be disappointed that I can guarantee!
B0069RQ5CK|5|Awesome stuff. Keeps my new truck looking sharp
B000CIF3WA|5|nice gage set all you need.....
B00GU8XFRG|5|This was a perfect fit fan for my 2005 Chevrolet Express van 3500 6.0L.
B00062ZDAE|3|Works ok after taking lots of extra time screwing it in slowly and back out several times just like running a tap to repair threads. I think this is due to the chrome on the threads. No leaks just took a lot longer to install in my fuel pump than I would of liked.
B00BCRMA9Y|1|Delivery was very prompt. With that being said, the product is very poorly made. Not happy with the quality of this purchase. Do not recommend at all, not worth paying any amount of money for.
B00QUBXBKO|5|working well and makes room for 315mm tires where stock LCA had tire rub issues
B006B80KKA|5|Used this for a 2013 Mercedes C 350 sedan. Watched a lot of YouTube videos where there were two filters. This came with one and my car only had one. Easy install and works great. The delivery was quick
B00917J3TM|5|This item fit perfectly in my car. It met all my expectations and were exactly as the specifications discribe
B000KYWW66|5|thank you great product.
B0091Q3NCG|4|Works very well right now for its price, but is clearly very fragile and cheaply made. The bargain males it worthwhile, and I wouldn't expect this item to last long term, but I needed an immediate solution, and I got this delivered in a day. Not an item you'd want to drop on a hard surface.
B000E28CBS|5|Arrived quick and was correct
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Appears to be a high quality piece and install was a breeze.
B0035MYV9G|5|Nice! Fits great matter of fact perfect. It really shines up my dull grill. Looking good!  Very happy with the product. When u purchase not if you purchase you will be very satisfied.
B0050VGZLM|5|Would definetly purchase again from this seller.Awesome service and no problems. Thanks!!
B0006MWPZU|5|Exactly as described, has been great for extended road trips. Worth the purchase price.
B00MAQ5TA8|5|Really glad they were available on Amazon, our local dealer didn't have them in stock and they were back ordered else where. They were the perfect fit. Will definitely be ordering again once I use the ones I have.
B00L888TVA|5|A real nice addition that dodge decided to exclude.  Nice piece of mind item
B00OBU7VB6|5|My Husband was very pleased with the alternator.
B00GTDNV9Y|1|One of the  peices didn't fit rite I had to cut it out to make it fit
B00CHGFGPY|5|Just Was I was looking for, all good.
B001U7M2OO|2|Did not fit my 1974 jeep.
B00NMOLI8O|4|Good as OEM quality boots. Brackets could be better.
B00HY06JTK|2|not that bright but it was okay quality. 3.5/5
B000CQOIR8|1|Double check the part number on the Reese sight to make sure it really does fit your vehicle prior to purchase
B00IPDQWLK|5|Awesome
B00K8E0WAG|5|I was very pleasantly surprised to get it earlier than expected.All charged and ready to go.
B00RBML7RK|5|Popped right in. Works great
B0076DID6W|5|Been on the car window for a while now.  Still looks nice.  Good item.  Keeps the Mrs. feeling proud.
B00DELNHJI|5|Really nice and safer to drive my razor 900
B0040DTLJE|5|Exactly as pictured, Great Quality and fits perfect in my car.
B006ULJ1Y4|5|As others have said, it is obvious that this was created on a computer because it is slightly pixelized. It is not noticeable on a vehicle though. I have it on my back window of my truck and it is holding up amazingly! We have a lot of sun and rain in Florida and it has not had any effect on the sticker what so ever.
B0073VC6YM|5|Fits my 2011 Grand Cherokee perfect. Much less noticeable than factory antenna. Good FM and Sirius reception.
B00CINCJ9W|5|Great product. Works well.
B0049BV654|1|after six months of operation began to buzz tensioner pulley.
B00MGI60RQ|5|LEDs lights are bright and work as described, the 5 mounted LEDs have great light output. They are slightly larger than a 194 bulb, but fit perfectly. These LEDs are polarity specific, and unmarked. Otherwise a great product.
B009Z1KQ2M|5|Wife loves these grips on her bike (2012 CBR250R).  I jealous because I have yet to buy/install them on mine.
B004LYR4FK|5|Excellent value and product
B003V9UU66|3|it glue
B00U9Z1J9C|5|great
B009OEMJL6|5|Better than original and simple replacment
B00NWT66CM|5|Awesome product
B000OV6D3S|5|Good product, fits perfect
B00DJEDGVY|5|Easy to install, looks great.
B00J5HEK7S|5|OEM product. Good price. Fast delivery. Would purchase from them again.
B003MO295A|5|I thought it was going to be a metal Keychain,  but it's a 3Dis ruber design, that is great!! Good quality and looks awesome!!!
B005PUBZ5E|5|Perfect fit for my Town and Country-S.
B003L35936|5|only wish it was a little cheaper, but I guess you pay for peace of mind!
B000C5YCZ2|5|work perfectly
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Really lights up the area your backing into. Worth the price.
B00KTIA134|3|Remote did not come with instructions as indicated, but rather a link for programming that did not work; however, programming is easy to find elsewhere. Battery also needed to be replaced within a few weeks. Other than that unit works good.
B00IAZXN2Y|5|This was a great solution to the ugly air dam hole on the Ecoboost F-150s. Thanks to all who suggested using cable ties for installation. It took less than 2 mins to install and looks great!
B0014FGS6U|5|We bought this for a our Toyota Sienna.  Item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  Installation was easy -- just six bolts and a set of ramps to elevate the rear of the vehicle.  Worked like a charm.  One warning though, if you are going to add this to your van, get a set of air bags for the rear springs.  Otherwise, you will be scraping the rear end constantly, especially if you tow a trailer.
B003L8WUBU|4|nice little step stool
B00CO2QQQ4|5|They were just right
B0013CXCYK|5|BULLY POWER!!!  This Bumper Guard.. KICK AZZ!!!  If you have a nice car you want to protect from Bad Parking folks.. GET this one right here.<br />I named mine Bill because he Blocks the BULLS***!!
B008SERWQA|5|awesome.
B000JZD71A|5|A+ as discribed,
B001E359MQ|5|Works great
B00I3PM9ZS|2|Not as sturdy as it claims to be.
B000ME1HQU|5|Great product~
B0009IBJE4|4|instructions not real clear, no diagram relating to the function of the differant buttons , how ever once you figure our your settings it works great
B00192MU2Y|4|Nice replacement, they could have made the wire connection better but just strip double the wire and bend it over to make the connection work.
B00AU75KQC|5|The fit was perfect would recommend
B0076PKN1S|2|i bought this light and i hace the same feelings as some others.  the halo is very dim, can't see it in the day and when the projector is on ... you still can't see it. besides that, the projector light seems to be also a halogen type of color and it almost looks like the standard fog lights i already had on my car.
B00ZVJ2ZPS|5|I bought these for my 2006 Toyota Tacoma they fit perfectly and I was actually really impressed with the material. They have a strong &#34;New material smell&#34; from the packaging but i'm sure that will go away :) All in all great buy for the price! Thank you thank you
B00PE5HCGQ|5|Get design fits great all around great buy
B004MXN71U|5|Was just like the original works perfect.
B00429NKWK|5|Very nice product
B0002Z9L7G|2|It's difficult to get on.  I keep getting it upside down or backwards & finally gave up.
B00192JGDU|5|great
B008KZK8F4|5|These fit my car perfectly and they were exactly what I needed. I liked the ease of finding this original part for my car through Amazon.
B005NLQAHS|5|This little guy is pretty awesome, I used it to clear a couple codes when I took out a cat in my Subaru WRX. The app I used was torque for android and it gives you options for performance testing (0-60 times, quarter miles, etc) and graph readouts. The bluetooth connects quickly and the unit sticks out a little bit but tries to stay out of the way when driving. Very much worth the money and does what the 80 dollar units do at auto part stores.
B003Y8EFRO|5|Better then expected. I had one of their older units that looked like a huge lock. This one is much better in that it's harder to cover the hole the alarm sounds out of.<br />I don't know how other people are having this go off inside their bags.<br />The key doesn't slide right in and out with the greatest of ease. But it works very well.
B00H1E4QFI|1|Not what I expected. I had to peel each and every letter off individualy. Would not rub off as directed. Piss poor.
B002MIQBZG|5|Works great. Highly recommend using the included hook to clip a wrist strap to the mount.<br /><br />The only issue is finding a good security strap to wrap around the radio. I ended up finding a strap at REI that's designed for a climbing chalk bag. It would be benefitial if Amazon would list one as a suggested item.
B009QT1KLO|5|Product works as advertised. As always, shipping was lightning quick through Amazon! Thanks! When the fuel burns, I do not smell it at all, yet, since my mower is brand new, so we will see after a mowing season or two.
B000EFMU4A|5|The fit was perfect for my 95 Ford Windstar Van.  Really improved appearance with these hubcaps.  Have received many compliments.
B004A6KANM|5|It worked really well I would buy a next one again it's really wonderful I would recommend it to other persons
B00F8O9FG8|5|Well constructed, easy to install and looks very clean.
B0019CSNNY|1|I liked the extension handle on this squeegee, since I'm trying to wash my apartment windows, but the rubber is bent in the middle which creates a massive streak every time I wipe with it.  The streaks completely defeat the purpose of cleaning my windows.  I ended up purchasing another product as this was too cheaply made.
B004TRKBOK|3|Ok item.  feels very cheap. Hollow handle.  But it does what it is designed to do.  Don think it will stand up to much abuse though.
B002ZBWKAU|5|I love it.
B007R4H3X4|1|Not worth money .. Pls don't buy it
B0049MMS96|4|Installed it and hope it works if needed.
B002R1QCW0|5|Perfect fit. Great Price...All good!
B00ED2J1OM|5|absolutely adorable, it is &#34;quiet&#34; but says what we love to all
B0002T8FM4|5|Excellent
B00IY4J0LO|2|Lasted only two weeks and broke...Not good quality
B003ITIUU2|3|I'm gonna give a 3 for one reason I didn't see much of difference on torque and material feels lit be cheap but they got a lot good reviews so mine may not make alot sense
B00T0WONOI|4|This Tint fit perfectly, easy installation ( I've done it the hard way multiple times) The only issue I even slightly had was the fact that it is very thin. more so than I've ever bought before. thus, the four star review...
B001T7JEOQ|4|Nice quality tube
B000C81WGG|5|Perfect fit took care of my proble
B004HYPO38|5|Lesson learned. Don't watch a You Tube video of someone else installing before you install. Follow the directions and apply as the manufacturer suggests. Once they are stuck down, they are stuck down! If you get them on a little off, they will always be a little off. They look great and do the job.
B002YKGLUW|5|Easy to use. Seems very accurate.
B0033QO022|5|Good price
B0009H519Y|5|Great for polishing rifle actions and pistol triggers.
B00GZLMEN4|5|I have tried everything my 21 yr old truck's plastic rear bumper pads and front bumper valance, that nasty white oxidation just wouldn't go away - 20 minutes rubbing this stuff on and the plastics looks like new!! I was about to buy replacement parts at $200. Been a month out in the hot texas sun and still the oxidation hasn't returned. I'm hard to impress, but must say that this stuff works.<br />Note - It's made specifically for oxidation on black plastics - And it is not a scratch/scrape/dent repair product - my plastics have slight surface damage, but now they are like a new &#34;blackness&#34; the actual damage doesn't show as much ;)
B00V6QM19K|4|For the price definitely worth it if you're looking for a quick boost, but as they say you get what you pay for I wasn't too satisfied with the air filter on how it just fell apart on me and then blew off on the road lol..so future buyers HAVE SUPER GLUE!!!
B002PDV4PU|5|Looks great on the gunmetal Prius C it was ordered for.
B001R91QN8|4|Fun Marathon car sticker.
B003XWEOQS|3|Not all the withe adapter came with the package now I only have 3 powered windows
B005CLQ3RQ|5|The replacement tailgate handle is as good or better than the original.  I switched it out in under 10 min with a liitle guidance from a youtube video I found.  I'm glad I bought it... saved a lot of money....compared to buying from the manufacturer.
B002YS2GV2|4|perfect product, but not exactly as shown, does not come with cover grill
B00NXRXH8O|5|Great design,  great performance, great buy.  Worked well with my Honda Pilot 2005.
B004UQV3II|3|solar panel came un glued
B005WVZFC0|4|These guards are great and are exactly as described.  Shipper delivered on time.
B00OM7BZME|5|Arrived quickly and applied easily (without any bubbles).
B00I5055P2|5|Just what I was looking for! Great product that achieved the results that I wanted. Quality!
B001447URM|5|the right part
B000XA5NEU|5|Works great
B00HE1FQFW|5|Fits perfectly!
B0009JKGII|5|I was afraid of using this on my car in case it took the paint off but it worked exactly like the advertising said.
B00G3EAGO2|3|seems to do the job
B00XZDBZ2G|3|Yes, for cruising below 60mph.. over that speed the visor presses up against my lips because of so much force of wind against it.  Stylish and comfortable.
B007HRI81M|5|I've used it in two high mileage vehicles I've owned and I feel it's increased the life of the vehicles
B00AWYBNBO|3|This product does not fit any Cobalt model like amazon says it does. It comes with 3 different adapters (for a variety of cars, &#34;universal&#34;) that do not fit on the wiper arm. Just in case anyone else missed it, this is one single wiper blade, not two. On the quality side, it appears to be durable and rust resistant. Apart from that, I do not know how well it functions.
B001BFLV9C|5|One of the better brakes pads to buy. Made in USA
B00RVEBB8S|5|Leopard heaven! It sticks great and is just lovely!!
B00EI6CKVE|2|design is great but it looks really cheap. you can see the outline.
B008Y84LF0|5|exactly as advertised. fits perfectly and easy to change.
B004RDVR8U|2|Works great. Very easy to install. The car shop wanted around $250 to install new liftgate suspension arms. Thank you to these, I saved a bunch!!  Update 5/31/16...  lift arms are no longer working properly. They worked great for a short time and then begin to show loss of power to do the job. At this point, they won't fully lift my hatchback. Back to square one where I started from with the old ones.
B00VCTZZ0I|1|Doesn't fit. Very hard to open.
B005XH6HIE|1|Buyer Beware<br />Amazon said that this product was guaranteed to fit my 2004 Kia Rio. I got it all put together and placed into my car.<br />Until the very last bolt that is. The lip on this strut is way too close for the bushing on the bolt to turn. This also happened with the G52016 (the right front strut). I am very disappointed with this product.
B000C9IZT2|5|Doesn't get better than OEM. Well made product and it FITS PERFECT
B002RSIK4G|5|We were very happy with the tape.  The adhesive was so strong that you really had to work at keeping it from sticking to you fingers!
B002ZXHGWK|5|Perfect fit. Very easy to install and look nice
B000CF3XKC|5|Perfect fit for a 2006 Cadillac SRX V6.  FYI, Bosch is the OE maker for oxygen sensors for this car.  No reason to pay more when this one works perfectly!
B00KGT9IUS|5|3 months later it's still working like new!!
B00S043JF6|2|good quality, but not too bright, I would say regular bulb is actually brighter...
B00XO7GL54|5|it works great
B00PV6T586|5|Good product
B00029JKG4|5|Wow, big difference when paired with MSD spark plug wires. Throttle response is much better and can really feel the difference in power. I would have put this product on a lot sooner had I known it would make this much of a power boost.
B000C5G93K|5|Love it and works great
B00TM26HVI|5|Nice fit
B007PVHVO0|5|Good quality-fair price-very pleased!
B0035DLJ2M|5|excelente
B004WNU4JS|3|The holes didn't match up so I returned it.
B00TUNSOMO|5|Easy to apply & use this spray on WAX ONLY product works really well on a variety of surfaces...I tried it on fiberglass and it works perfectly. Like another reviewer, I am also interested in using it to protect other surfaces (like my shower) after deep steam cleaning and scale removal. It does a great job of sealing the surface to discourage hard water and soap scum build up after cleaning, so much better than silicone based products. This is by far the most useful way of using this spray wax (&#34;off label&#34; usage) for me. And yes, it works great for boats (!) as long as you understand that it's a WAX ONLY product. It's super easy to apply and remove (shine) after cleaning. It also effective on painted metal and plastics, stainless steel and aluminum and other non porous surfaces. Like ordinary paste wax you allow the product to dry to a haze then buff to a glossy shine. I find that microfiber works well after initially removing the product with an old sweat shirt first - a soft terry towel works too. Either way, the point is to remove the product before attempting to get a final shine. The really lazy person can also use a machine to do the work as well. Application with this spray cuts the work of having to tediously apply a paste.<br /><br />Directions: Apply product onto a cool, clean surface. THIS SPRAY WAX DOES NOT CLEAN THE SURFACE! IT IS WAX ONLY!<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: Water, surfactants, and proprietary waxes (not a lot of chemicals here!)<br /><br />There are NO SILICONES in this spray wax, which is the primary reason I wanted to try it. Lots of great uses for this Carnuaba wax spray and it's super easy to use compared with paste wax. Highly recommended!
B002ZTNVDM|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ
B00WVJPXU0|5|I had read a lot of forum posts regarding the installation of various LED H11s on 899 Panigales, and most people had terrible luck due to clearances.  I decided to give these a shot because the clearances they experienced, and the issues they were having, I didn't foresee.  I was able to install these in just a few minutes, and they work fantastically.  The cooling fins do rest a bit against the metal frame under the dash, but not in a way that I would ever be concerned about.  I simply untwisted the old bulbs, routed the new wiring, hid the control boxes behind the rubber cap next to the light housing, twisted in the new LED bulbs, and connected the wires.  No tools required other than a flat head screwdriver to pry off the factory plugs from the factory bulbs.  The color temperature fits the factory 899 LED running lights perfectly as well.  Great bulbs!  Thanks OPT7!  In case it comes up, I got the Dual H11 60W Motorcycle kit.
B001NZZAGU|5|OEM part.
B000HBNTX2|5|This product works as advertised. I usually have grit, grime, oil and grease on my hands and Fast orange gets rid of the mess on my hands. I like the smell and the pump action spout on the bottle. Fast orange does not chap my hands.
B001445OUM|4|Fits my alpha one
B0031C3UDI|5|This paint is awesome it matched my factory FORD grabber blue spot on. It flows real nice and matches good
B005DNBJ1I|1|This is a set of head bolts, for only one head, so the advertisement is intentionally deceiving since we all know there are two heads on this car.
B000BWCFIM|3|works well, needed to drill hole to zip tie to spring to keep it in, but it did good on the springs and I could feel it in the race.
B009Y8CCAA|4|The shield itself arrived on time and lives up to the description.  The only problem I have with it is that I did not process in my mind that it would not fold up neatly like most shields out on the market now a days and if I have a full car, I have to put the shield in the trunk, otherwise it is in the way.  Also, the first weeks that I have had this, it has been raining none stop for days, so the temperature never got too terribly warm for me to notice a difference.
B000BPUTO6|2|Will this fit on a Honda CR-V 2008?
B004I0PJEU|5|Great fit
B00FDQPCR2|5|Works Great.<br />Mine needs some more tuning.<br />But, I will recommend.<br />But, I don't use it for a work light
B00407WNE0|5|Pretty excited about this add-on.. came packaged in a Mopar (OEM) box, and after install fits like it should have came from the factory.<br /><br />I purchased the 08' JKU Sahara used and it had a rather unsightly chrome cover installed, from another aftermarket company. Very glad I replaced it with an OEM part. Pricey, but worth it.
B00F7QZM2I|5|Cupcake Zombie Pin-Up, What else do I need to say.
B000CB6D0S|5|thanks
B00FSVT4XK|5|These are just much cooler looking than your average led tail light and different. I am using them for the rear tail lights of my rock crawler.
B002M67J5O|1|Doesn't fit 2010 Subaru Forester. The original factory rotor is almost one inch smaller in diameter.
B0031GVNAG|5|Seems like it was OK tranny is still in one piece. Right part packaged well.Mopar  New fluid new filter brings the transmission back to life,shifts better etc.
B00199F2WW|5|Used in combo with the Ignitor 2, this works great.  Truck runs much better, and no fiddling with points anymore.
B001UC3C0M|5|$120 for all four is far better than $100 each at Dealer, and $100/wheel to install, for a grand total of $800.  America's Tire installed them for $125, so $245 total.  Only DF was bad (likely dead battery), so did all four at once as they are at least 11 years old.  Costco and Les Schwab will not install TPMS that you provide, citing liability reasons (= not getting a markup on parts).  Cars did just fine for 100 years without TPMS; bend at the knee x4 and check your tire pressure like you're supposed to!
B003AL23TC|5|This unit provides peace of mind especially during storms.  I can't say I completely understand everything it's telling me though.  I plug it in, give it time to do it's thing (about a minute and a half) watching for any errors to show up on the screen.  If all is well I plug in my rig and lock it to the post using the handy metal collar shown in the photo.  Only thing I don't like is it hangs out below most electric posts.  If rain is expected I pull an opaque plastic bag over the whole post.  I doubt if rain will hurt it but it makes me comfortable to know it's protected.<br />I've plugged into bad electric posts in the past and got away with just blowing out a new space heater.  I no longer worry about it.  It's on the expensive side but cheaper than having major appliances replaced.  I was hit by lightning once and survived w/out damage to my unit.  I don't want to tempt fate!
B0041WOEYG|5|Installed this bad boy on my 2008 Honda Civic EX and it had my AC back blowing within seconds.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone instead of paying $30+ for a OEM part.  FYI I got this on a emergency Sunday delivery!  Keep up the great work Amazon!
B00P2D4BPA|3|I've had packages from central Europe get to me in less time than it took these bulbs to arrive, but the product was as described and both bulbs work fine.
B002OMUG3S|5|Quality S&S parts at a fair price. Had everything I needed for a for a complete overhaul, minus jets. Shipped in a timely manner. Thumbs up.
B00T0WWP2A|3|Works pretty good. I have a Subaru Outback and while the side windows were pretty easy, the back window install was near impossible to install without bubbles and wrinkles even with two people. This was my first time ever attempting this, so maybe it was just me. It was well worth the $30 though to have all the windows tinted in the back for my little girl and the cargo we carry in the back.
B00B3V2HRY|4|Good product at a good price!
B012XIP074|5|Good product, a great value.
B005N76UCC|1|I'm normally a medium and so I ordered a medium. Well it would not fit at all. More like an x-small. I'd order the x-large if you have any junk in the trunk. Also not impressed with the quality. I think it's pretty cheaply made for the price. I've gotten much better underwear for cheaper.
B0056BBFX4|5|Looks good and fast shipping
B00CZ6LUQA|4|id love it more it it fit better.  I dont have a big head either.  7 1/8 fitted hat and this thing is tight.
B004ME4NDA|1|Misleading size ,  too small and ineffective height ,seek another type at big box stores
B00480GY0S|5|Seem to be Ok
B00AC6YA1W|4|Very well constructed and fit well on my KLR 650. Large enough to hold essentials like gloves and glasses but not much more.
B001EAQTRI|5|Crystal clear sound with this.
B00DLMMZ3Y|2|Bought these brand new. Came in the mail yesterday 8/5/15 and installed them. Worked good at first but after a test ride with them they quit working.
B00514BR5C|5|Nicely made.
B006AFAWYI|5|This product does exactly as advertised,  Made the washing and waxing of my 50Ft 5th wheel camper, golf cart and F350 truck something I did in one day with less effort and amazing results
B0085KGOIE|4|As most have noted, it's incomplete as sent.  Requires another twist connect sewer hose fitting to be completely useful.<br />Otherwise works as expected.
B0066QRMX0|4|Perfect fit for 2001 VW Jetta GLS 2.0 Auto w/Air.  Can be installed without removing fan shroud.  Took all of 20 minutes to install.
B00T9SS53S|5|Great Helmet, near perfect finish. Fitted great and the interior is excellent quality.
B0006SH4IM|5|This is the best vehicle wash around, use it for my detail business.
B00G9W9TK0|3|Decent bag for the price, but overall would not recommend. Fork up the cash for something a little nicer. Cortech is only a little bit more expensive and supposedly nice. But personally I'm gonna step up to something nicer like SW-Moetech or Giant Loop.<br /><br />Good design, plenty of storage, but internal organization is lacking. I don't personally find the external, clear pouches on top to be useful. I end up keeping my phone inside the bag and snaking the headphones out for GPS. Strap mount didn't work very well on my bike (1st gen sv650) so the bag tends to move around a bit, though not an unreasonable amount.<br /><br />NOT impressed with the construction of this bag. Day 1 stitching was loose or not trimmed. Since then (only had it for about a month) more stitching has frayed, the zipper covers has started to deform (making it more difficult to close with gloves on or one hand)

B00T7BTRLG|4|This is a wonderful looking switch, I wired it in my Jeep and ran in to my A-Pillar, great product....no wiring instructions came with it would be only complaint, I think it's critical to provide people with appropriate schematics for electrical components cause someone can damage or cause a fire their vehicle or whatever application if they don't know what they are doing (prolly shouldn't be playing with electricity either), anyhow I did my research and wired it correctly and it works great.  One star off for not providing electrical schematic, not everyone knows how to wire a 5 pole switch.
B00BD6D4B2|5|Thank You.
B00EDFM66E|5|Great price
B0002MA4X4|5|Great--I totally recommend this purchase.
B001JKXJF8|5|easy to put. Fits like a glove.<br />No complaints here
B00W9CFN86|5|I am pleased with the fit and it protects very well.
B000V2Y4FE|5|Pipes look geat and sound even better. Great product especially considering the price, would definately buy again.
B00JVHLS3G|1|Very poor quality.  Mounting pins too small.  2 piece tape together design.  Plastic logo turned yellow in a couple of weeks.
B00L9IHO9M|4|Seat cushion works really well, attaches to my motorcycle seat well using included attaching hardware.  Item was received fairly quick and I installed it that night and used it first thing this morning and felt great on my hour ride into work.  I would recommend this item to my fellow motorcycle riders.
B00JTUBTQG|5|best oil for you're car
B00EC2CKW8|5|Excellent!
B006ZB8KS2|5|this is from HFT. i use a lot of teflon tape and this works very well. a great price too.
B0041MVALG|5|Excellent carrier.  Light and easy to slide into vehicle receiver hitch.
B004BP9IEO|5|Love it sound perfect
B00B9F1BAI|4|BUMPER CAME IN WITH FEW SCRATCHES. ALSO YOU WOULD NEED TO PRIME IT AND PAINT IT AND POLISH IT A FEW TIMES FOR IT TO BLEND IN OTHER THAN THAT IT IS PERFECT FIT FOR RAV4
B008VOOPW6|3|ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!! But...when driving highway speeds the attached wings, fighting with the wind speeds, really bend the antenna which concerns me.  I will not return them because they are so cute but I think I will cut down the wings in an attempt to cut down on the bending issue.
B0095GODRQ|5|Just what I needed for my service dogs vest.
B000XEGEWG|5|Best microfiber towels I've ever purchased. Actual dust magnets! Good price, great quality. Just have to buy more now because I use them for everything from house and auto cleaning, to TV and device screen cleaning. The best!
B00KULIE9I|5|Perfect for my Wives 03 Escape. Bought the rotors and pad here cheaper than I could buy just the rotors local
B00BXPRB5S|2|Looks nice but broke after two weeks of ownership.
B000NWJJLG|5|I absolutely love Rain-X! After going to college in the rainiest city in the country, with a car whose windshield wipers were not working properly, this product was a life-saver. The water immediately beads up and runs off your windshield, helping your visibility immensely. I will always clean and protect my windows with Rain-X
B010R32L3I|5|Great Product<br />I'm always willing to try anything that will make my 64 Olds Cutlass looking good and easy to maintain. This stuff was remarkable. The instructions says for best results to leave it on for at least 30 minutes before taking it off.  It was easy to put on and I left it on for 5 hours before taking it off and it was easy to come off. My car is Red and the color just &#34;popped&#34;! It's like a mirror. I usually have a small accumulation of dust on the car over a weeks time even though it's garage kept but it's been a week now and it is just as clean as the day I waxed it. Can't say enough about it.
B00F9LQ3RO|5|Have a 2015 GMC Sierra 1500 SLT Crew Cab.  Fits very nice and made very well.
B00HEV2TD4|5|It extended my oil change by more than 3000 miles according to my car monitor. I'm impressed and will use it in other equipt. such as my outboard and pressure washer.
B004IYV7OM|5|Worked great for a 2000 gmc serria
B00ONDM07G|5|Fits perfectly and strong enough to hold an iPhone
B004N0EX7Y|5|ordered for my husband and he loves it -- great product, works as expected and quality item!
B005N6YFYS|5|Absolutely Love this shirt! It's my second order with hot leathers and it fits great. The logo is awesome. And I wear a 3x and its actually very, very true to size. Couldn't be happier
B00EN20KQ0|5|Exactly what I expected!  Don't you love it when that happens!  Good value.
B00IAYS5E6|5|product as described, great quality,
B005NLQAHS|5|Nice ODB2 reader. Works well with Torque. Easy to use.
B000K02EDG|4|Fits a 2001 Tahoe 4.8l SFI engine perfectly.
B0001CMUV4|5|Works as advertised.  No more hitch wobble.
B000GD5FMY|4|Great glasses....it fits perfectly.<br />Very comfortable and good cost benefit
B00IEYDHUE|5|Worked perfectly and is now used as a spare.
B00E7WEFQ2|4|look great, easy to install.  Only problem is the tape will not hold them at highway speed, so I installed with epoxy and gorilla tape, good for up to 75MPH so far.
B000GOJW9K|2|Fan was wobbly when at full speed. Sent back because of slight vibration over stock blower.
B000EPSAUI|5|Perfect fit and work as they should.
B000CKN762|5|purchased these for my '95 Jeep XJ. Great upgrade.
B00063X38M|1|Tube exploded on first squeeze
B000FOUB8M|5|The cargo bar works well.  It is great for securing items in a full size bed.  It has worked great for transporting gas cans without worrying about them tipping over.
B0013FSL8O|5|Matched the originals. Easy to install and they perform flawlessly. Price was very reasonable. What more can be said.
B00BITREGU|5|This part fixed my window problem. Very happy with the whole experience.
B000CLOT6S|4|bit pricey but fit was great and all the pieces youd ever need for rebuilding including clips and check balls.
B0011O0YDW|5|Good quality construction, Should last for a long time. Good price too!
B003ATCLYG|5|Good, solid, easy to install hitch. I would have put one on years ago if I had known how easy it would be to install.
B0084L0YR6|5|It's been working perfectly in my 2005 Envoy for several weeks now. It's nice to have ac blowing again.
B0053X4XRU|4|These mirrors really add to the look of my 109, but they have a limited view compared to the stock mirrors. Great for show, TERRIBLE for traffic.
B008G28DSK|5|Good
B005FUTYC0|5|Perfect fit and looks awesome
B005LLGQJW|5|Fits great.
B009OBVY06|2|not as advertised.. does not work..
B00GCUJYGS|1|Was not a good fit
B000HI9E7U|5|Works Great
B00K8DD8C6|5|works great, made in USA and is why I bought it!, seems slow, but have nothing to compare it to and saves my back. easy installation.
B00KQXKG46|4|Good
B0041CFWYW|4|Put these on my 010 Electra Glide. Easy install, looks great, feels good! thank you!
B005XH6JAA|5|Came fast and is just what I expected!<br />Dot approved and will keep my head safe!
B000VDHZOA|5|Good product
B00970ZHIO|5|Put them on your conservative friends cars and trucks lol
B00EKTJ6HU|5|Nice exactly  what  I  wanted
B001G5W1M8|5|Genuine OEM and 1/10 the cost if ordered from GM.
B00UNTU3VO|5|So far it works great. I just want to know when and how to clean the duster? Thanks
B0045I1H82|5|Configuration: Cloth40/console/40 seat<br />First set we bought was for 2014 F250 40/20/40 with foldown armrest. Fit perfectly. Had an accident with that truck so bought a 2015 F250 with bucket seats and fixed center console. Was hesitant to purchase because of bad reviews. We just finished installing them on our new truck. Hassle free installation, nice tight fit and good quality material, exactly the same as our first set. We highly recommend this product.
B008AGTCVY|5|Works great and came on time.
B000CAYSUQ|5|This belt was perfect for my application.  Bando's belts are of excellent quality, and they are quite fairly priced.  I also am pleased that it is an American made product.
B005NKRYM4|5|It came quickly and was what it said it was.
B001EOV45G|5|It's great quality.  It feels like 100% real rubber, instead of cheap vinyl or plastic products.  Don't forget, there's a storage area for the wire connection too.  I thought that was cool!  It's months old now and still looks like it was freshly made.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Nice color; waterproof and easy to clean.
B00Y3H3TOA|5|THIS HITCH RECEIVER IS MADE WITH HEAVY DUTY STEEL. THE ONE I BOUGHT BEFORE THIS WAS ALOT THINNER STEEL.THIS  6 1/2 RISE RECEIVER WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY
B00CN4YNP4|5|Great product. Feels a lot better then the stock plastic one. It's not to big and not to small and fits perfectly on my 2000 Jeep Wrangler
B00WNISTP0|5|Pro- worked great nice and bright<br />Con-harness did not work. Had to splice the wires nothing a little electrical tape could not fix. Would buy again
B0097C9Y3Q|5|easy peasy works great
B00IS93TI0|5|Looks great and was extremely easy to install in about 20 to 30 mins by myself. I've had the bumper for a few months and the rectangular LED lights started going out,I contacted E-autogrills and they sent replacement lights at no change. They are a great company with great customer service.
B00OGNJFFS|3|The front covers were a little bit but they were manageable. The back ones were way too big. Kind of a waste of money. Could've just bought front seat overs
B004GDR0R8|5|Works great. Easy to install and makes a huge difference over the old ones.
B00B5X68NY|4|Runs a little on the small side. Other than that, this seems to be a good product that I intend to use in Cosplay. Arrived on time.
B004ALK5O6|5|Great fit, good price
B0014JQ13Q|5|Nice frame good quality
B000HPWPP6|5|Pack well with 494 silicone grease, good quality bush & bracket
B00JX2UCQ8|4|Fit perfect
B00L84EKI0|1|Did not even come close to fitting my 2006 Toyota Tacoma with a 6 Cylinder engine. Not sure why it was to match my truck but when it arrived it was 76 mm and my truck has a 67 mm 14 fluted filter.
B0052ORSB8|5|I broke the shell of my keyless entry remote for my 2008 350Z and saw this and ordered it after seeing on Youtube the procedure for myself on how to program the new remote into your car and was confident I could do it myself without having to go to the dealer.<br /><br />Got it by the end of the week programmed it in and it worked just like a charm.  Even though it feels differently in my hand and the buttons push differently, it has all the same markings on the back cover as the original.  My guess is that my original is just worn down some and the buttons therefore feel easier to push.  With time I expect my new one to break in and feel easier to push the buttons.  I get about the same range with the new as the old which is a good sign :)  Overall for the price I paid, I am very content with my purchase.  Too bad I can't get a replacement key as easily as I have a chipped key and that requires the dealer to program a new key into your car.
B004BPADG6|1|I purchased this frame over a year ago when I get my new car. I was so excited when I found it, because it was EXACTLY what I wanted. However, the black pieces that represent the black piano keys started coming off within a few weeks. At this point, there are only 2-3 left. Also, the bright colors are severely faded. I am now looking for a new frame, because this one is just sad.
B000IY8OLU|5|These are the best wires for the Miata.  A perfect fit for our 1999.  We have used other wires in the past and they don't match the quality.
B005GHB5U6|5|Love it
B000C2ANZS|5|great product!
B00A82JM90|3|Not nearly as bright as I had hoped they would be.
B0079DGP64|5|OEM. Easy to install.
B00HJDUNWQ|5|Great quality not a single issue ever
B004BS0M50|5|Great product...better to have 2 people to install...fits 15 and 2016 trucks..ford f350
B009VOQ05U|5|Works great, easily installed and arrived in only a couple days. I'm an electrician so I use it everyday to haul ladders and pipe.
B00D9W4I5E|5|Love this on my bathroom door so cute
B00MJUXS6W|2|Fridge is ok but came without glass panels on the doors. Also took a week longer than promised to arrive.
B00O85TDTM|5|Best of what I have buyed for no mini cooper countryman! Will buy again for other cars !
B0048FZSOQ|4|I gave it 4 stars because of the fit - well designed.  I bought it specifically to reduce the glare from my grey dashboard.  (Love my 2011 Prius but the placement of the indicators and low light level is the dumbest thing I've ever seen)  I thought the plush black would do the trick.  Unfortunately because of the shiny synthetic fibers, it actually sparkles in the direct sunlight - works great in overcast conditions.  Even though the surface doesn't get hot, the plastic dash beneath it does and the cover holds in the heat like an oven mitt.  Was going to return but not worth the shipping cost.
B00EPT59KS|4|Only a four star rating due to a slight dent in the top bar. Can only be seen because of the distortion in the crome. Overall the guard looks great really dresses up the front end.
B001TEOMW8|5|Good fit seamless installation
B00BVL7M26|2|It works but disappointed , fails to strip wires every time
B00YG65B0S|3|Material: Basic Plastic<br />Quality: good but feels a bit cheap but for $10 dollars I guess good.<br />Experience: amateur. The delivery was fast, but I received the wrong color. I had to contact the seller good thing they are located some what near and he was able to switch it out in the main factory. So that was a bit of a pain because I had to go out of my way to get the correct item.
B00488JCMW|5|works great.  Easy to install and rack the bikes.
B00C305898|2|they are the wrong one for my bike but I misplaced the screws so I haven't returned them for the right ones
B00JRPAFDQ|5|Very happy  the hopper got there quicker than I had expected
B00AFWO9VE|4|Works well. CanAm original products are a bit overpriced. Not sure I got the value for the dollars spent.
B00CPN0BB8|5|Great quality, very good adhesive.
B00PQWN5DQ|3|This is a good gauge.  The dial is a bit small, but is readable.  Rubber surround seems like it will protect it.  I wish I could talk it up, but there isn't much to a tire pressure gauge...
B00BCRMA9Y|4|bueno
B003WM9RZW|5|This works very well.  It leaves the RV looking like it was just waxed.  great product.
B00371VL52|5|Heavy duty unit.
B001TI5IIQ|4|working good
B000Q0TCX0|5|Been on 2 months no problems easy to install
B0050VFA8G|2|This device worked well the few times I used it...until it died tragically.<br /><br />It is partially my fault.  I tried to run a rather heavy load.  There were clicks, then smoke, then no more clicks or smoke.<br /><br />Of course, one could say it was entirely my fault, however...<br /><br />I've had other inverters, and every single one had overload protection.  If you asked to much of them, they'd shut down, usually giving you a nasty buzzer in the process, just to let everybody know how bad at math you are.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of Black and Decker, and this is only the second substandard product I've gotten...the other was an 18v shop radio, which was a joke.<br /><br />I loved the looks, the cable options, and the USB plug.  It was very handy for running low power laptops, charging phones, cameras, and various other things that need charging.<br /><br />I'm tempted to give it 3 stars, however these things are often used for emergencies, and without overload protection, this is much more likely to fail when you really need it...which I did at the time.
B00K3B595M|5|Got them but haven't use it yet. I expect no problems!
B00OLP4I9O|3|Does not fit newer Infiniti EX35 trunks at all. This net is designed to lay flat. Newer models don't have the proper hooks for this. They're designed for vertical nets. This net CAN work that way, but not very well. Too much netting for that.
B000C7YCIM|2|Wrong part for a 1996 Dodge 2500 Ram Wagon
B001JT1CEE|5|It does what it does
B000E7SY0C|5|Great hitch and seems very well built..  I have a Honda Ridgeline and the ability to tilt the bikes out of the way to open the tailgate is great - obviously you'll need a little muscle with multiple bikes loaded.
B003YCAAKG|5|Decent lights, very good price compared to others i saw, for a 2008 Mazda 6 sport only. These are very clean and you will need the covers to the bulbs, as it does not come with any. Your old lights should have them.
B00BHD6710|5|Amazing case. Leather is great quality. I've used it for quite a while and there isn't a mark on it, even in and out of my pocket.
B000AA4RWM|5|work perfectly  tells you how many inches you are off and bingo you have a perfectly balanced camper every time  get them!
B00B5ZY07I|5|I installed the license plate clear cover and the chrome screw fasteners this weekend. It took me less than 30 minutes to do it. I followed the instructions sent and had no problem what-so-ever. They look really nice on my car. I am ordering another set for the front plates. Just take your time and follow the instructions.
B00LBCXMII|5|It is much better than the original no problems installing it! It is reasonable and the u joints are much easier to replace than constant velocity  plus much much cheaper!  Absolutely no vibration. The stories about vibration are false!
B008G1ZKGE|5|Perfect fit
B0006IX87S|5|We have had no issues with the filter, will probably purchase another filter next year again.
B009153IWM|5|Looked great! Fit perfect!
B00NAR0S20|5|The TTX lights met my needs. I am very pleased with the items and will purchase more in the future. The brightness is perpect for what I use these lights for.
B000N3W8J0|5|Does its job.
B00AHJZBCG|1|at first worked great. after first charge as per instruction, it no longer works. very disappointed.
B0009H52BG|5|Great filter and my husband always has purchased Fram.  You get what your pay for and this is worth the money.
B0026M7WGU|5|Nice set up.
B00KMBOWGA|3|The quality wasn't as good as I hoped and a couple of them ripped apart when I tried to unstick them
B0043FR2XG|5|Cheap and works.
B001QG76B8|2|Ok... But  they get stack ):
B00F0VK7RU|5|Installed this kit a few days ago. Installation was quite easy and the kit included most everything needed. My only caveat is that the kit only includes two installation bolts instead of four. This is pictured and not a real issue as old bolts can be reused. However, replacing all bolts would be preferable as they can shear from continual stress. Anyway, price was fair and the kit worked out.<br /><br />No more squeak and my BMW is not embarrassing to drive. A-quality overall.
B00H6XUWVG|3|would get 5 stars if tubing was clear instead of black
B001G64HIS|5|Works as pictured and replaced an oil cap on my BMW. The quality is excellent from what I can tell.
B003YKXTSI|3|Not bad as a key chain, but also not very useful except for the light.
B00DP5K97Q|5|Colors are true to picture and worked great to match our jet ski
B0040AE7WS|5|Well made, didn't realize it would be solid metal, awesome pick up, it's sturdy
B000C42RYQ|5|The shipping was fast and they are a perfect fit. very happy!
B00AR4SJCU|4|Nice feel, fits snuggly in my Ford F250 steering wheel.  Took a bit of time to put it on.
B002MNU4YU|3|Very Large!!!
B0013LH206|5|Be careful if you install this on your ATC 200x. Mine has so much compression now that it keeps injuring me.
B008ZTX02S|4|It's a nice helmet but it's geared more for scooters , and once on its very round so makes you look like a mushroom head.
B00XBMDJA2|5|Fits nicely, can hardly wait till next oil change. Seemed to take a while for delivery.
B00ARJQTT0|5|totally pleased with this product
B000E7WLJW|5|This bag held alot of our camping gear. Good purchase for us! It fit perfectly in the Pro Series 63154 Hitch Cargo Carrier we got.
B00YU0WWDY|5|Bought these to make a switch panel for strobe lights, driving lights and air compressor. I haven't had a chance to hook them up so far due to having to work 7 days a week. They seem like they will work fine for what I need them for as I am using them all with relays so amps won't be a big issue.
B00537FIRU|5|Great hitch and easy to install.
B008N8ILQG|4|Haven't had to use it yet. Looks to be well made. Only time will tell..........<br />Only 4 stars due to fact I haven't used it. Other than that I have no problem with it.
B000BUQODG|5|easy to install, works great
B0076O5XD2|5|Great product!  Fits perfectly on my 2015 Camry SE.
B003NU0EM8|4|I actually use it to hold a plastic square ruler in place while I cut along the edge with a rotary cutter. Works great.
B00LYL6P9E|5|Great gift for Mountaineer fans!
B005RSUOBU|3|Well i mean it showes what it is in the picture and as far as confederate flags go this was the best i could get
B0002NYC0Y|1|Cheap metal. Striped on first bolt. Not good for any torqued bolts.
B00144B32A|5|I purchased this for cleaning vinyl boat seats and carpet stains.<br />The product worked great for me.<br />I combined this with a magic eraser and everything cleaned up nicely.
B00II5YADC|5|Use it for a shower squeegee and it works great.
B000E2F1WG|4|It's Oil. Product arrived on time as advertised
B00JH2GMMC|5|Fit was perfect, fast shipping, and great price.
B004ERQS42|5|My pooch loves these!
B000BYGD4W|5|Worked good ,exact fit .  Good oem replacement, you Have to drill out rivets on mounting bracket to mount coil on a 4.3 vortec.
B00QSMTGP4|5|Perfect fit .makes car look 100%better . Easy install
B0001XPCCC|1|very bad quality...
B002ZBWKAU|5|This is one of the most handy little gagets  I've ever owned. And one of the best purchases I've ever made. I highly recomend this.
B006X8CH5O|4|Can't complain for the price! Somewhat easy installation, had to bend the grill because it didn't flush properly but it'll do. Got here fast!
B00D329B8Y|5|If you have never had a 3 year old spill food/drink in your car, consider yourself lucky. But with three kids and the many activities we have in one day, my mats have not survived. I really needed to remove the old ones and find mats that would be easier to clean. These mats are heavy so I know they will stay in place. They cover a larger amount of space than the manufactured mats that came with our car. There is a small flap that you are instructed to cut, but we felt that it added about another half inch to the mat and that half inch may save the flooring underneath. It will not be an eye sore because it is hidden under the seats. Easy to clean when we go to the car wash, because you can just rinse them and they air dry while you vacuum the car out. I would recommend these to everyone I know.<br /><br />*These were purchased at a discounted rate and and this is my honest opinion of the mats, as I have them in my car and love them.
B00029KA6S|4|Just a described, only thing wish the string/ tie would be a little stronger. When pulling it to wrap around the wrap to secure it broke with not a lot of tension. Looks great!
B000WJ7OIA|3|Close, but not OEM fitment
B001MQPQQ4|5|EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED
B0028075TO|5|Awesome stopping power!
B009PQHUIK|5|Perfect part. Great customer service!
B006O3CHUI|5|Worked great would recommend again
B001BTPKHW|5|Wow!  It actually fits a woman's figure.  Had to wait a while until the weather cooled down before I could wear this jacket.  It is VERY warm.  Even without the liner. Good fit; pockets are good.  I wish the zippers weren't quite as sticky, but that should clear up in time.  Kinda busy around the wrist: Zippers and Velcro?  One or the other should be sufficient. The price was fabulous and I'm am quite happy with this purchase.  Delivered when they said it would be.  No complaints about shipping.
B00MVN6V8O|1|Says ships from US but it took 2 weeks so not sure about that.  Also make sure you have a Ball Point Pen to push them they are so Small!<br />Typical Bait and Switch with people not imagining the item would be so Small... A little bigger then an LED light bulb Gosh....
B004I11UUG|5|Works perfect on my 2009 Denali
B00N6DBXG8|2|They look bright when looking at them, but they hardly light the road.
B005JWCGN8|5|It is a great steering wheel cover.  It is great in the winter because it is so warm.
B004TC1GFS|5|Superfast shipping g and correct product. Worked great
B000DN7VLU|5|Arrived as promised. Works great on my 1985 Chevrolet CUCV.<br />Carl
B001GKBCTQ|5|Worked great!!!
B00WLRRD8C|5|Easy install and a great product definitely feel the power difference!BTW did it to a 08 hatch with vf52 swap with ewg
B001JSY6FC|1|Poorly made. Thought I could just get by, by going cheap and that certainly wasn't the case. Came out the box squeaking and the ball fell off, literally. Only used it for 1 week and it is broke. SMH
B00BPSUCPE|5|High quality. Seems to really work.
B0052XN2ZA|5|This SS exhaust tip fit my 2015 Jeep Wrangler perfectly.<br />Looks good.
B00L85QB86|1|Poor design,  separated while putting on the key.
B00SMH58N2|5|Lights are very noticeable, great product.
B00DC6MRIM|5|nice thick and strong love it
B008KZK8F4|5|Perfect fit.  Looks nice and good quality.
B000KKLLFS|5|Plastic but feel solid and tight. Will buy again.
B00BCRMB34|5|Nice product looks great
B0017UBHQS|4|awesome product
B0015KH93K|5|Simple to use, follow instructions, be EXTRA careful to unscrew the piston nut slowly when removing the core because the pressure pushing the extractor may cause the core to fall out.  The pressure is stronger than you think.
B006BCRNYM|5|Works perfect
B004GEP7VS|1|Do not have len for headlight only signal len
B0093PGG74|5|right part
B000BWAOWG|5|Very happy. No problems.
B002UC4TGC|5|another great product
B001KSEFUC|5|Best Price for an OEM part
B00P2D41OQ|5|These are so much brighter and look so clean in the housing!
B0081S5IP0|4|It was a gift, It works.
B00L4TF32G|5|have always liked this  great for the boat
B0076O2CNQ|5|Good item. Thanks+++++
B00A6G5SB4|5|As expected.  Excellent and efficient.
B002TMQ4AM|5|Perfect fit. I have been using this company for years and have not been let down.
B00BI3JGC6|5|Been almost a year and still working great, easy to install
B00X32LTT8|4|I have a mini van. I have 3 little kids. We are always running somewhere. The van gets messy. This is a very convenient tool to have. It plus in to the port in your car...or van and sites a great job of sticking up the little messes that always seem to happen, like the sunflower seeds that my daughter jumped in the van yesterday.  My only issue with this is that the hose and attachment is kind of cheap plastic and really had to be shoved on to fit. But it is effective so I can't complain.<br /><br />Please note that I received this product at a discount in order to provide a fair and honest review.
B0066QR8FM|5|Easy install.
B008G4YMHY|5|I think this was perfect. I used it to control the light bars on my four wheeler. I used the turn signals for small LEDs on the sides through relays to light up the side of the trail when needed. Great driving down the creek. I turned the horn button into all lights on through a relay. It fit great and looks like it should be there.
B00498DFH4|4|The price is good and it works so far.
B00550MXKA|5|Awesome sunshade.<br /><br />It was a little pricey but it works very well and fits my window like a glove. Great for the Phoenix sun.
B000IHIAES|4|makes finding source of noises a lot easier
B001EEWCRU|5|Mine are black which wasn't what was said or shown, but since my order and this review the pic has been changed to what I ordered not a generic red poly pic. They are quality parts though and I will buy them again for other vehicles.
B0013EHC4O|5|Still looks great!
B00OWS4K6Q|1|If we could select zero stars, we would. Wouldn't line up after over 2 hours of working with it, absolutely didn't fit like it is supposed to. So we decided to return it because apparently it was defective. After spending $75 to return it, which they in no way intend on providing back to us, we still haven't received a refund for the product even though they received it one week ago. Really terrible customer service, this is how you treat your customers? Worst part, we really need the cover!
B00QW55XI6|5|Perfect fit and easily programmed.
B00O5FUJZM|5|Perfect fit in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited (4 door)
B0047MAPFM|5|Can't believe this part is so cheap.  Easy install, looks and feels like an oem.  Only problem: auto down cannot stop until the window is fully down... Makes for a mess on a rainy day and you just want to crack the window.
B00029KC2U|2|Because a lot of folks make ethnic jokes about products made in China, I find it pretty funny when I see the same thing happen in a product that proudly markets itself as an American made item. It has a typo right on the box, and the product has a strong smell right when you open the box. I had to put it in my own bag, just to not smell it.<br /><br />To sum it all up:<br />1. Clearly engineers/shop folks and not English majors<br />2. Smells like it was made in a factory filled with sweaty skunks<br />3. I found a competitor product for half the price, 25% wider, not smelly, and guess what? Made in China...sold at Home Depot.
B00MIZT7OK|5|Nice!
B000C5453G|5|Hole is not tapped for grease fitting so you will have to use the fitting itself to cut them in or a tap. I just used the fitting and it feels like it had more bite which will keep it in place over the life of the joint.
B0000AY3SX|5|I got wax on my dash on my 1995 Honda Accord from a cloth I thought was clean , wax everywhere  tried everything from bleach to WD 40 nothing worked . Went on line and found this little jewel of a cleaner ..followed the directions and it all came off . Cleaned all of the vinyl in the car. This product works. After cleaning I used the Meguiar's M40 Mirror Glaze Vinyl and Rubber Cleaner/Conditioner. Beautiful finish. I will only use Meguiar's products from now on .
B001V8UHWQ|5|all  i  expected it to be
B000XQ9MGE|5|No complaints!  Easy to charge and easy to use.  Substantially less hassle than jumper cables.  I've done four jump-starts in the past few weeks, to include two V8's without any problem.
B001LHVOVK|5|work real good, I am glad that i got this it say me money
B002LEEXWE|5|Great product
B000C06Q38|5|Wrong part for me but great quality
B000H0QRFK|5|Nice
B005JVNPRA|5|Royal Purple is my oil of choice for the last 10(ish) years. I personally feel like there is a difference when my car drives in RP vs any other oil I've used.
B00BF8N74C|5|Fits my VW Beetle perfectly, they look just like the OEM that came with the vehicle. Are very easy to install it literally took 30 seconds per wiper blade to complete the installation.
B001AJH1HK|4|I can confirm that these mirrors do fit onto a 2005 Pontiac Vibe.  However, I do have them secured with zip ties just in case they were to ever slide off while driving.  Which has not happened so far.  They do make a little wind noise, but nothing I would consider annoying.  The mirrors do shake some while driving down the road going 50 mph and faster, obviously they are not nearly as solidly fixed as the factory mirrors.  However, they don't shake so much to be useless, but you still have to use your factory mirrors at certain times while driving.  They do greatly enhance visibility while backing up, which is their primary purpose.  Contrary to what other people have stated before, these mirrors can be oriented vertically or horizontally.  You definitely would want to take the mirrors off before going into any automated car washes.  I don't know how well these mirrors would hold up during the winter, I know I will take mine off for winter.
B000C33M8C|3|Works what more can you say! Quick delivery !
B00ATT4VGQ|5|Very cute, I love them! They are made very well.
B0030311FC|4|nice ramps!
B00651OAVS|5|This stuff is fantastic! It makes routing new brake lines so much simpler.
B006OQ35GU|1|I think this product is a good idea to be able to see if you get your black tank clean but my first experience was just the opposite. First use of this product in Italy and made a bigger mess then what I would have used it. After I finally got the black tank shut off and the mess cleaned up this went in the trash.
B0014FKI1Q|1|The threads between the tank and the cap do not match! I filled it with oil, left it briefly on a slight incline and it started leaking from the cap, had a decent mount pooled over the course of a couple minutes.
B008GVFZKU|5|Great day time visibility
B00BFDJDJ0|5|perfect fit
B00EEMJBYQ|1|Did'nt work out to good!!!
B00BTKWQ3O|5|We like the bulbs. They are a whiter light than the 921's they replaced. I think they are a little brighter than the 921's. We changed out our whole motor home and the are much cooler and use less battery.
B00CZG1ZRY|5|Exactly as described
B00L94GQZ4|1|Didn't fit my daughters Corolla Sport as advertised.
B0045XRK06|3|It starts working great and with time it looses power, so the light is not as strong.
B000BZTII4|5|Good fit
B00ELHT5P4|5|I moved my Buell 1125r to Royal Purple. The bike runs better and noticeably cooler than before. I really love RP products, high quality and really help extend the life of your vehicle.
B003TP09O0|4|Not bad at all a little off the exact fit but u make it happen
B001EOV42Y|5|Fit great and looks good. Grade A #1
B003TNHETA|5|Real cool
B00PJH5V76|3|Runs small
B00239R96Y|4|As expected<br />Fast arrival. Good price!
B007LICJ0S|5|Excellent, just as pictured and just as described, easy to install and very stylish
B00GSAUHB8|1|This is the worst product i ever bought. my car remains too hot. it never cools it.
B000JZUU92|4|Gave 4 stars cause did have 2 issues of running high temp and had to add coolant. Don't no what happened or if it was involved
B00HG48C80|4|It's been outdoors on a Weather Guard tool box for a few seasons now and, it shows no signs of failing. The quality of this particular vinyl has been suprisingly great. It was easy to manipulate and resetable with or without heat (if you're even mildly patient / skilled).  If they only offered more patriotic American themes in this particular grade of vinyl I'd be all over it! I would find things to cover...
B01092IEEM|3|didn't care for the fishnet type fabric. i was concerned about how much stuff would get caught in it. but they looked nice. i returned them.
B00LXAMVOE|5|Made for the car and you can tell by how snug the fit is. Shipped nicely without bending. Appreciated that. The velcro keeps it wrapped up nicely for keeping stored.
B00B0QBC2I|1|awful and not even resibido
B00ANA5YY4|5|This floor mat fit like a glove and is easy to clean. it keeps the Dogs hair and drull very well contained.
B004ZF4F7A|4|The lights look great and really dress up my vibe.  Can't complain so far after a 2 weeks of install.
B00SDO61QC|1|its been 4 mounts since  i buy  them and the lamps all ready crack -0
B00CZDVOQY|4|excellent
B000HSASIE|5|Works great on my 1980 Suzuki 400
B00I87FA2K|5|great item
B00N6AT4YY|5|Awesome
B00BJCHTFW|4|Chemical Guys have updated their appearance of this item.<br />It is not longer contoured like it used to be, so keep that in mind.<br />I bought this applicator pad on June 19, 2015 and I received the contoured version.<br />You will probably receive the flat version with grooves that is pictured.<br /><br />The contoured pad that I received is fairly large compared to my other flat applicator pads so keep that in mind if you have low profile tires like I do.<br />It holds a large amount of tire dressing rather neatly but since it does not have a plastic handle, it feels awkward to use.
B00ZED026U|3|I thought it might have come with the exhaust gasket also. But it didn't. Had to buy separate.
B000B6JPWW|5|very nice metallic frame.  perfect for Florida.  quick ship, just as advertised. very pleased. A+
B003NU0EM8|1|This struggle to stick to a window... let alone pull out the dent in my car. Do not waste your time or money
B005ITX2LC|4|Product works very well and is very easy to apply.  I was happy with results although severe spots needed two applications. Good product and happy with the wax removal. Needed very little elbow grease.
B00D5XSFZQ|5|Fit perfect!
B002OUIXU8|3|It serves its purpose if you have 2 sewers connections on your RV. However, one issue I find with it is that the fitting does not contain a clapper valve, i.e. there is not a way to isolate either the right or left part of the fitting of which you are using to dump. So the contents of the sewer can and does back fill into the other hose. So be mindful if you have one line on your Gray Tank outlet and one on the Black Tank outlet to close the one you are not dumping. Especially if you are dumping your Black Tank. And you will have to manually drain the line you did not use to dump, as the contents will take the path of least resistance. This could all be solved if Camco manufactured this fitting with an isolator or clapper valve to prevent this. In all still a good product. Just beware of the back fill into the adjacent line.
B004TSOZTG|5|Great stuff, very solid and keeps the OEM look but gives that brand new look to the front end.
B00CO6Q1VA|4|It works but I wish it had more rubber slip fittings for the bleed port.
B004969RCI|3|Very streaky, and don't work well until they're wet. Spend a little more and get better quality wipers.
B0084O11YI|5|Exelente
B003OAES8I|5|at the time//
B003DFIW1S|1|Got a bad one, wire was disconnected on the inside. Wasn't worth the time to return it.
B00JJX1TA4|5|Perfect for my conversion.
B000EJ4SPU|2|Besides the dusting and some squealing I had a total pad failure on one of the front pads with less than 40,000 miles on them. This is on my wifes daily driver Excursion that only pulls our boat a few times a year and it only weighs around 4000 lbs and has trailer brakes. Stopping power was improved when the pads were new but I noticed a definite decline with age.
B00TP0K60K|3|It's a nice sticker, however I feel that since I've got it the thinner areas are giving out and peeling. Because you'll be typing on your computer your arm will be rubbing up against it and it might peel faster. I suggest finding one for the front of your computer where it won't be affected.
B00VIVAE10|5|Excellent
B00RV83UUG|4|light works great, good price but please get rid of the alan head screws and put in some normal bolts that you can use a socket on!  i had to buy new bolts because the alan heads are junk!
B0001EFSTI|5|All of this units features work but they aren't the easiest to use.  The knife isn't so sharp, it takes some work to open a bottle, and the screwdrivers are awkward.  However, they do all work and this is a backup device.  I'd rather have a crappy bottle opener in a pinch than no bottle opener at all.<br /><br />I was worried that this would either be really hard to wrench open and get off a keyring or would open way too easily and fall off.  In my opinion, the one I got strikes a really nice balance.  I can get it open and I don't think it will come off in my pocket.<br /><br />Note that it only opens to 90 degrees which seems to be best.<br /><br />There seems to be some debate out there about whether this is airport safe or not.  I haven't tried it in an airport, but the blade is serious enough that I can't imagine it being allowed on a plane.
B00P9EJGR0|3|I have Nissan rogue 2010. they are fine.<br />Sometimes they slip away, and tightening causes them to wrinkle.
B009D41M9C|5|Very nice.
B000GBIPY6|1|It's not match with my BMW 325I convertible 1987.
B000IOOME8|5|great product, installation was fairly simple, and programming was a breeze.
B00TQZVDDI|4|Looks great on my husbands truck
B006OVTY0Q|4|Would  be  a five if it wouldn't be  wired backwards.  Up goes down and down goes up. Other than that  works great. Thanks
B006VFR2LS|5|Perfect for my roll cage
B00L4G91V8|4|Good price, fast delivery
B00CRQYX62|5|I don't write many reviews, but this product is worth mentioning. I have purchased over a dozen different LEDs for ny cars, have enjoyed them, but they are almost never as bright as listings make them out to be.<br /><br />I recently purchased a small dome light panel for my BRZ. It worked, looked like an LED should, but wasn't near as bright as stock. So I started doing some research and found this. Wow, super easy installation, direct plug and play. My car wows every person that sees it from now on. If your looking for maximum light output, DO NOT waste your time on other bulbs, this product is what you need
B00CYGNJ2Y|1|Very poor quality.  You have seen other reviews with the same outcome.  Here are my own photos.
B0041FCNU0|3|they work
B0035533S8|5|These work very good especially for the price really can't go wrong and its a very complete set covers all the major threads you might run into.
B00E9HWS9G|5|this rubber mat is great. It was outlined where exactly to cut it to fit your car perfectly. Great Idea. THANKS AMAZON&#62;
B003VLBPJA|3|product was delivered on time but is not heavy duty, had to double them to hold a bag on my motorcycle
B00PLXWEB4|5|Perfect fit for my 2012 Ram. Easy to install once you take the wheel off.
B003BMCL4M|5|this case isi well made and I would suggest as good as the more costly Minn Kota
B00KWN73EG|5|good quality for the price, not disapointed
B000A835AY|5|Very handy for a great price
B008N2JL5C|4|Fits and works perfectly.  OEM at a better price.
B007S0GQ3A|5|Product came fast 🙌 I bought this after loosing my keys in wegmans, and a friend recommended getting on of these! So of course it had to be under Armour and I LOVE it!!! Product is super high quality, and I haven't lost my keys since lol!
B000VKRQ7O|5|Can't beat the price and delivery time. Just like the name brands and can't tell a difference. Fit just like OEM.
B00WINKFRK|5|Love it
B003RQBKLC|5|I bought this so when we travel I can use my GPS and charge more than one phone. I will use it soon.
B00O4Z5XOA|5|Fits perfect in the back of our 72 Chevy Luv. Very comfortable too
B00D754BYG|5|as per listing, works great
B00KJ8JFYK|5|Very nice
B000LG06UM|4|First before I start I am a professional mechanic so my install was using a lift and all professional tools. This job took me approx. 3 hrs to do including clean up. (I do not normally install custom exhaust) This install would take an experienced do-it-yourselfer a good part of a day rolling around on the ground to do this job. The instructions are clear and cover the entire install completely. This is a great sounding stainless steel exhaust system by Gibson. The fit for this particular system was as expected considering the vehicle didn't originally have dual exhaust. I would expect the single exit to have no issues because I didn't have to change anything on that side. With kit where your adding something not originally fit to the vehicle I always expect some minor modifications to get a perfect fit. All the adjustments were just cutting a little pipe off for clearance. I didn't run into any issues until the spare tire area. The pipe running behind the spare was hitting so I had to shorten the main pipe to move the tail section away from the tire. I also moved the tire a little for more clearance. Gibson should change their clamps to a strap style. The U-bolt type clamps are not very good. I will likely weld my connections. This system is cheaper than the magnaflow system and you can see the difference. The finish and clamps are better on the magnaflow but who crawls under their car to look at their exhaust anyway! This install was on a 2003 Cadillac Escalade EXT 6.0L engine.
B001G6H9HE|2|Bought this for a 95 Sentra Little did I know the valve covers on the 95 and up Sentras are plastic and have non replaceable spark plug seals.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS KIT kit if you intend on replacing the spark plug seals on your 95 and up Sentra, I broke the plastic plate that is glued over the seals to help with oil distribution trying to removing them. I ended up just going to the junkyard and finding a 94 Sentra with the aluminum valve cover and buying that for $20 just to use the plug seals that came with the kit, though of course the actual cover gasket is different between the plastic and aluminum covers so I ended up not using the gasket that came with the kit.
B006X41MTU|5|good fit
B0016LG0CY|1|Worked great for about three whole seconds and then nothing.
B00EZIQR64|3|I little on the dull side for a boost gauge but works as advertised.
B00VGL86SU|5|Looks great I wanted a ball with a one inch shaft for the hitch it fit perfect. My last one was stolen so now i'm keeping it inside the vehicle while not in use
B00MNQU04U|5|Work great on the seats of my hubbys pickup!
B00YB5GAEA|3|This item broke super quick; the USB plug pulled off from the back. I would only expect this product to last one season at best so you are better to spend a little more if you want it to last any amount of time. The battery in this light presses against the button cover; this is why you get a nice solid click feel. This practice is generally frowned upon in the electronics industry, but having been made in China I dont think that they care.  I would suggest looking at the Bontrager lights for quality products that will last.
B00F66TFH2|4|ALMOST an exact fit for a 2006 Silverado 4.3L work truck. Don't know why but the lower hose was just a couple inches too short and I needed to splice in an extension piece.  Other than that it is a well made quality product. Much better than the generic &#34;one size fits all&#34; part that the local parts stores are selling.
B00WE65J3G|4|Great product , the fit is a little off, but my wrangler looks bad a$$
B00LZODW1O|5|great product easy to install
B000AM8BF4|5|Works as advertised... A little louder hum than my last one... but who cares...
B000UK0D0M|5|These fork springs made a huge difference in &#34;nose dive&#34; when braking!!!  I can't believe how weak the factory Sportster fork springs are in comparison.  These shock be put in every Sportster that leaves the dealership, it's that big of a difference.  I paired these fork springs with the Progressive 412-4024B 14.25&#34; rear shocks, talk about a night and day improvement in ride quality and handling!!! The bike is an animal now, I can actually take the twisty roads at speed now and get into a somewhat decent lean (which was not possible on my 2014 Iron with the factory 11&#34; shocks and saggy fork springs).<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend these fork springs in combination with a set of Progressive 412 series shocks!!!
B003L2VYWW|5|Royals with cheese
B0062IJPEQ|4|Easy to install and a definite upgrade over the stock fuel door!
B0001MQ7E0|5|awsome cooler/warmer works great and very lightweight
B00HFKDLCW|1|This does not work or fit for a 2006 Toyota Tacoma 4x4. Took this to the dealer and the pins and disc size do not match up.
B00480BWCI|4|Much easier than toting wood blocks around!
B00VWK5SR2|3|Sticker is printed and has visible lines through length, making white letters a bit grayish.
B0033WNKJU|5|Worked great! Fit my rails and were easy to install.
B000BRCIJ8|5|nice price for the steps. look like good quailty.
B00FTAZPDI|5|They fit! Thank you!
B0010Z4MDK|3|It 's fine but terminals are too large. Wwill have to return . Is there  ano model with slightly smaller terminal.?
B00UZP1HVQ|5|Fits great and is better than the green cap truck comes with, only thing that would make it better is if you could put the tab straight down but the door doesn't close all the way if u do that just a ocd issue of mine
B000CLTKIU|5|met and even exceeded my expectaions
B00WQSFLPS|4|Provides power as described.  I wish it would have an on/off switch too.

B001URVKS8|5|great gloves especially if you have long arms, as my son does!! Very good quality & workmanship!!
B003YNYCIG|1|I am not sure what went wrong with this filter. I went to Amazon.com and typed in 2014 Chevy Spark Oil Filter and this filter came up. I then went to the section that asks &#34;Will this fit&#34; and selected 2014; Chevy; Spark and a message came up that this would fit. I purchased it, drained the oil out of my Spark for it's first oil change, took off the used filter, tried for several minuets to spin this filter on and it did not fit. The threaded hole looked to be about 5/8 to 3/4 of an inch on the new FRAM filter, and the original filter had a threaded hole closer to 1/2 inch. I had to push my car out of the way to get to my Jeep, go to the parts store and get one that did fit. I purchased a Purolator L16291 and it fit. Also, the G M filter that came on the Spark is G M 96 985 730. Perhaps General Motors put the wrong engine in our Spark. I am not sure what went wrong. Thank you for asking Like many of the other reviews, the filter has a nice grip, and I like the orange color; that is why I give it One Star. Randy Hale Alexis, Illinois
B008XL1DZE|5|Exact replacement works fine
B009O0RT88|5|It fits perfectly and looks identical to the original part.
B00IO8IP3Y|3|I like this product.  It does everything that the factory standard screen would do.  The one major issue that I have been having with the product is the retracting mechanism for the screens which attach to the rear seat head rest.  For some reason the driver's side screen will not stay in place, and often snaps closed when driving.  Cue heart attack when you're sitting quietly at an intersection and WHAP!!!  I will try and figure out how to correct this with a zip tie or something.  But overall, I am pleased with the price point and provided concealment I was looking for within the open CR-V design.
B007GREAKG|3|This is a very nice looking air cleaner however after I installed it on my 2002 flstc heritage softail the bike ran like garbage. I did a complete carb clean and it still ran poorly. After giving up and taking it to my local Harley stealership I learned that this setup is for a bike with EFI. They ground a channel in the backing plate to allow a carb port to not be covered and its running great now.
B005RNEH5O|5|Great stuff...highly recommended for a brake job...great price
B00NQ451TC|5|Bought for hubby for his birthday. He loves it. Arrived super quickly. Thank you.
B00LHNTWXK|5|Great product!
B000HDD6E2|4|it sparks
B00AQ8H3RY|1|does not fit into my corolla S 2009
B00LST7A00|4|It is very good keeping out the sun however, it is a little short for the 2015 Highlander.  I would buy it again.
B00N27K1IY|5|This product fits perfectly-no issues. Also, it was delivered on time.
B000CH15XC|5|They are nice but since I went with Moog Problem Solver tierod ends the head on these tierod ends are way too big for this product. OEM would fit fine but my oem tierods had pressed on rubber boots that have a ring inside them which keeps them from falling off. If you are just wanting to keep the red poly theme going on your vehicle you might want to wait and measure your rod heads then order.
B004I0YUXQ|4|Nice product. Fits good. Looks like original equipment.
B0004ELKC4|2|Package came, stained by product leakage. This is too expensive to pay for leaked product. As for the product, it's ok. It's a bit messy. My kayak, about a month after using, now has a white film, I thought this product wasn't supposed to do that.
B00U1NTX9K|5|Worked as a replacement on my Simplicity Coronet riding mower. Would probably work on most 12 volt systems.<br />Had a bad solenoid and could tell as starter kept running after key was turned off - tapped bad solenoid body (and it would stop) as solenoid was sticking. Replaced with this one and although mounting holes lined up it ended up mounted in a different orientation when compared to my old one, but it worked fine as I just made sure to connect the same wires to the same terminals (2 small wires to small posts and large wires to battery and starter just as they came off the old one).
B002DZJQ0A|5|Performed as advertised
B00FMUYTGY|5|Delivered in 4 days, Easy to install and a lot cheaper than GM.
B006KZAJUU|5|Works perfectly. Plastic is a little lighter coloured than the original part, but everything else is perfect.
B000BPLNXC|4|Perfect
B000W080W8|5|Easy to install and easy to use. Price is better than any other.
B003CJGNWK|5|Works Great easy to install
B00II7U58E|5|Very nice pipes fit perfectly on my 91 sportster. Doesn't come with flanges I used the ones from the stock exhaust everything mounted fine and sounds great! I had a question and contacted seller and they answered my question which resolved my problem. I recommend this exhaust over factory and also recommend this seller.
B005HTFQBM|5|Love it looks great fits great and was much less expensive then local Motor Sports Store Thank you
B000CMHNY2|4|it could come with stainless hardware
B00G1BXINI|5|great quality and great price!
B00JGRAP3K|5|so clean!  i mounted this on my motorcycle handlebar to control a pair of strobes i use when lane-splitting.  it's clean, durable, and looks like original equipment.
B002Z34VJ6|5|Not as handy as my missing caliper I've had for 50 years, but small enough. Also has a measure for depth (in a hole). I don't know if I'll need that feature but the rod comesextends whenever you use it and getting used to the obstacle. I will probably remove that feature. The digital is easier to read than the indices on my old caliper (eyes showing their age)
B00UBYR3L4|1|The material is so poor
B004XJLCDI|1|Junk.  Oring fit is sloppy with no way to tighten.  It will leak!  When I removed the lower fitting to see if there was a means to tighten it, I saw that the braided stainless cover was frayed and small pieces if stainless wire could flow with the fluid in to the tranny.
B009AGY7IQ|2|This is nothing more than a basic metal frame with stickers on it. It is not engraved. It says it is great quality. Well maybe the frame itself but I suspect the vinyl stickers will be peeling off real soon. Spend $4.00 more and get one the is laser engraved.
B00HNSSWQQ|4|A basic , functional set of meter leads, quality seems quite good so far.
B000CGVSA8|1|[[ASIN:B000CGVSA8 Edelmann 8525 Power Steering Gear Box Input Shaft Seal Kit]] This seal kit will not fit a 1985 CJ-7 steering box
B00VKM3PSQ|3|The cover fit great on my 2000 ford f 250 and worked well for about a month then top just came apart. OxGord was great with refunding or replacing the cover. I decided to upgrade to the storm proof one though. I think this cover would work good for indoor and minimal outdoor use.
B000CO8ZPQ|5|a+
B005G5RKOS|4|I  BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER SHE HAD A LOT OF CLOTHES THE BAG WORKED OUT WELL
B009EVM810|5|Great product and easy to install.  Took less than 1/2 hr.
B004I0M222|1|Does not fit like it should very cheaply made next time I will go to a junkyard
B00HG1J4WQ|1|Weak & flimsy!
B0058UHJPQ|5|Expensive but well built. Airaid seems to perform better.
B000E28C7M|5|Love these filters for my street glide
B0009IQZFM|4|good product  good seller
B0067ED17W|5|Fast shipping great filter good  price
B00IVA50K6|3|Quite a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but still pretty nice
B00RPKOF0E|1|worked only for two weeks with low mpg. then stop working.
B00CRR5LJY|5|Perfect fit
B00OBWSAG4|4|Did what it's designed to do in a good manner.  There is a gap between good and great.
B000OQHVQG|5|Very well packed! The zipper pouches have porcelain &#34;Mickey&#34; hands! Very cute and GREAT quality!
B007CVSEAS|5|These work great on both square or round pipe when you use the provided round pipe adapter. Secures your ladders, or anything on top of your ladder rack safely and holds it tight.
B00D2QL0DU|1|When I first got this, I actually like it.  It's a simple to use siphon/pump (although I mainly use it as a siphon).  So why one star?  In the roughly one month since I had it, I have only used it a few times...and for those times, I'm able to initiate the siphon by just pumping it once.  But I was trying to use it earlier today, and I pump it once as usual...and nothing happened.  So I pumped a few more times...and still nothing.  I decided to cover the ends of the siphon and noticed there's very little pressure, so I think the gasket for the piston in the pump must have failed and is leaking air, which would explain why I have to pump it like mad just to barely able to siphon.  I tried to unscrew the ends to see if I can fix it, but it doesn't seem to be threaded on, as it just spins round and round.  I have a feeling if I tried to pull it out, it will break it...though as it, it's still useless.<br /><br />I think if it's more durable, it would be a 4-star product.  I only give it 4-stars because whenever I initiate the siphon, the air would push the upper hose around, which in my case has caused the hose to come out of the higher liquid source a couple of times and spilled liquid all over the place.  I have hooked some weight to the end of the upper hose to weigh it down so that doesn't happen.  I only write this part as something to note for other buyers of this product.
B00374OASE|5|They r great just don't have my head set
B005HWTGQU|5|Item received as described.
B0090B7M2O|5|Description says: &#34;Ability to quickly Read and Clear codes in ALL modules&#34;. It identified the SRS fault code and after the repair it was able to clear the code as advertised. Well worth the price IMO.
B0000AXNMO|5|Used it before. Rain-X works well. water just beads off windshield. Might try on shower glass
B00KTIYXLU|5|Bought a used ford explorer unfortunately didn't come with key less remote. Checked online found these. With a bit of searching online on how to program it worked like a charm. Nice,  cheap and unlike some of the other reviews say. Works from a great distance away with no battery problems since 6 months ago.
B006GFU39Q|4|great product for support of soft bags, had to purchase longer bolts for installation, but found a good website to do so. www.belmetric.com
B000JQOKW4|5|great product and like the clear coat
B00CMX20H4|5|Love being &#34;THAT GUY&#34;  and with this horn people that get in your way on the lake will know if your not happy with there driving shills....
B00IY3YLCI|5|Well made, solid construction, installed them as backup lights on my 64 olds f85 rat rod. Mounted on frame behind bumper and simply points toward the holes for the light in the bumper, has a wow effect for sure. N
B002R0R1T4|5|Fast, Reliable
B000C83SRC|5|Fit like original. Easier to order here than to deal with the local &#34;parts&#34; store.
B00I8SJPPW|5|I did a lot of research on different exhaust's to try and find the best fit for my Honda CBR500R. This exhaust is great. Looks awesome and sounds amazing. Great rumble to it. No loss in power that I could tell. Look no further, this is the exhaust you want.
B00C0SNKOI|4|quality product, good price.
B0067F595I|5|Very happy with this product. Performance, fit, finish, and sound were everything that I expected from Vance and Hines.
B00509RC66|5|Awesome product!
B00AMH5SHG|4|Pros: The alternator on my truck says THANK YOU. I replaced 30 six watt (14 amps) incandescent lamps with the one watt (2.25 amp) LEDs.<br />-<br />Cons: One lamp was DOA.
B002QAU8MM|5|Fit my 1998 Ford Ranger perfectly.  It looks a lot better without the old plastic bed liner.
B002J9SMP0|4|ok
B006WNUQ7G|3|Bought to match rear rack for quick snap bungees. Theses are painted not powdercoated and scratch easily. Work perfect for my needs.
B00V4PMY7W|3|have had some areas that it wont stick and stay.  Others no problem.
B0091OG9Z6|5|Great--I totally recommend this purchase.
B00YVQD4A2|5|Excellent price for a great product. Very sturdy.
B00K5XH4TM|5|Just pops right in! :)
B000CFS028|5|Installed on our 2006 Toyota Sienna.  Raised the rear of the vehicle on a set of ramps.  Squeezed the air out of the bags and slid them into the springs.  Slid in the spacers.  Ran the airlines to my hitch and secured them with zip ties.  Installed the heat shield for the exhaust.  Added air to the bags and I was done!  No need to remove the rear wheels.  Access to the springs is quite easy.  We towed our trailer to the beach and back with no issues.  There is no sag and so sway and the rear end no longer scrapes on driveways.  This is a great, simple to install addition to your van.
B00TDOGRW4|2|I wasn't overly impressed. I'd been using Yankee Candle Leather car packs. I was looking for a better longer lasting scent. This was right on par with those. I was also shocked at how many sprays it took for it actually to actually start to be noticeable. So it's just OK for me.
B00B7QN4LI|1|I dropped it within a week, it fell apart and doesn't stay locked.
B006U3MU2C|5|Exact match to the OEM and easy to install in my 2008 Lincoln Navigator.
B001MPY4S6|5|very nice, will purchase again.
B0046NNNK6|5|Works like it should!
B00XA7EW1I|5|Good
B00NBVGAZ4|5|Nice rear mirrors!  good quality and new with all accesories,  its a good upgrade to factory mirrors,  my xj6n is looks better.
B0066RJIKO|5|Deal ok.
B00030CXZM|5|As advertised
B000OAW216|5|I bought it from Amazon warehouse deals for $19. Do not be foolish and pay $40. Just make one yourself.<br />It is a good product but it should be included with the exhaust system. Manufacturing cost on an item like this is pennies.
B001D6HLBG|5|My husband loved it !!!!
B002EBSLA4|5|great quality filter fits my Suzuki 70 hp outboard motors. delivered on time and in perfect condition.
B0055LVW38|5|Easy install, had over a year on my car with very little if any fading
B00MO0BVBG|5|Great product, great fit for my truck, made my truck look new.....thanks
B00PEFNPZI|5|Money clips were as advertised & a good buy !
B001VYT72G|4|Fits my 71 f100 adequately. Good enough for a universal fit.
B007ZDDUCK|5|Easy to apply and appears to be doing the job of protecting two leather arm chairs.
B005G82C8E|5|These shades attach to the bottom of the windshield and do not affect the defroster vents.  They have self-adhesive velcro pads that stick to the window and the 2 shade pieces attach to the velcro pads.  The shades pull up to the top of the windshield and have round plastic holders that attach to a hook that sticks to the top of the windshield as well as tucking under the headliner.  The handles on the shades can slide left and right to make sure they fit the hook location perfectly.  They are well-made and easy to operate once installed.  Highly recommend for anyone (like me) that forgets to install their sunshield when leaving the car!!
B00YTDOHSK|5|Look and work great nice addition to my vehicle
B00W57F808|5|worked great
B00HFK2R4U|1|Not bright at all. Stock bulbs are actually brighter.
B001U3LZPU|5|All products work very well in this kit.  Will buy Mothers products again because of the results I have gotten.
B00FQ0ROZS|2|The lights work and look good but full of moisture the first time it rained with them on my truck
B00AMPHHVI|5|A bit pricey, but adds a great subtle and stylish look to my 2012 Scion tC.  Fits perfectly.  Install took like 5 minutes or less.  If you're just starting to accessorize your Scion, start here...then add a shorter antenna, custom mud guards, and maybe change the interior bulbs for lighting...(Mine are deep blue, and it's slick.)
B009PQX9RG|5|Excellent quality! I got this as a gift for my Mother. She loves it. She also likes the color so she can spot her keys quickly.
B00943TYY2|5|Great looking and easy to install.
B002LBRI4M|5|These are high quality and are priced way less than some competing products. Installation was simple, and they've held up to 6 months of use and abuse.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Hands down the best set of light I have ever used little tight to fit in my 2007 Chevy Tahoe but boy do they light up the night<br /><br />Great product would buy again
