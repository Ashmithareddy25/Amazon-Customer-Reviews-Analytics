B000AA4RWM|4|These levels work very well in my 25 foot motorhome.  I placed them on the cabinet work surrounding the refrigerator, which is the main reason I am leveling the RV in the first place.  They were installed several months ago, the motorhome has been driver 5,000 miles and they are still secure and working fine.  I check them at the start of each trip with a carpenters level  and so far so good.  I was meticulous in cleaning the wood surfaces before attaching them with the supplied adhesive strip.  I find the inch gradations very helpful in selecting and setting up the RV leveling blocks.
B005DKIIJW|5|Excellent charger
B0007TV6M0|4|Awesome product from reputable company. I run a showcase detailing and maintenance company and I use this stuff specifically on my own trunk/hood/door jams. Great product, but you should buy it local for much cheaper though.
B000HUNHLM|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 BMW 525i. Exactly the same length and bends as OEM, fittings connect positively and securely. Seems to be of great quality.
B0049EJZA4|5|Tried the cheaper aftermarket, but still had engine light- This OEM part fixed it. The aftermarket part is only $30 and it is hard to bring yourself to purchase this $80 part, but in the end.....I shelled out more money because the aftermarket did not have the quality airtight fit needed.<br />ADDITIONAL INFO 11-14-13<br />If you need TPS, this is the one! In the end I had more engine light issues with codes pointing to up front bank O2 sensor, I changed those... still issues. FINALLY I found a thread that discussed issues with Ethanol causing problems with air/fuel mix. So now, not certain if it was ever my TPS, O2 sensor or muffler. I only know since doing all that and SeaFoam in my intake....after NOT use Ethanol fuel, 8 months later NO ENGINE LIGHT! My suggestion- Check Gas cap first ($8), avoid Ethanol fuel (Jeep Forums discuss this with 4.0), then try TPS, O2 ups (CA Jeep you have 4 O2 sensors, lower will not mess with air/fuel to set off light) Also.....when you change any of these things, a reset by disconnecting your battery overnight, never hurts. Let your computer adjust to the changes you have made or you may end up with a false/positive engine light.
B005DM5Y5Q|5|Even though for the larger size tires, it was a very tight fit. Looks great. Logo finish was good too.
B00126ETS0|5|Great product and works as expected. I haven't heard the fan come on but I draw under 40 watts. Nice plastic case.<br /><br />Pros: Quality materials, can be hard-wired, USB power port (great for non-stop ipod use), indicator lights.<br /><br />Cons: Outlets too close together for power bricks (but I'd rather have a small unit and use an extension cord).
B000GZLUBM|5|Great quality and looks super.
B00EMFMI1I|5|Nice decal and easy to install.  Really cute!
B0006H8AEK|5|These mirrors are wonderful as they fit perfectly over the existing mirrors on our Ford F-150 truck.  They provide excellent visibility with no vibration.  We are very happy with this purchase.
B007BKFG60|5|Fast and good product
B00E23OVAQ|5|GREAT
B0036E9VB6|5|I've had a VIAIR 70P for quite some time and that unit is great for the small pump that it is. When I needed another small portable compressor that was able to be powered by a cigarette lighter power socket, I noticed that VIAIR had a new model and got one. This one is almost twice as fast as the 70P and every bit as quiet. The unit doesn't walk around when you're using it and the brass screw-on tire chuck makes for almost no air loss. The LED power indicator is a nice touch and I found the air pressure gauge to be spot-on as long as I turn the compressor off to check pressure. In all, another nice unit. -I just wish this was available when I got my 70P. Side note: don't throw away the box - its a means of storage since this unit doesn't come with a carry bag.
B001DKO3X6|5|I actually purchased this for defrosting the freezer.  We only occasionally get cold enough here in SE Louisiana to have to scrape ice off of windshields, so it is hard to find scrapers in stores locally.  It worked very well and was easy to grip.
B005DLNQP2|3|Item as described. Factory machining of base screw didnt fit right mirror. Could not use one mirror. Fast shipping, good seller.
B003AOEAHC|5|I've had 2 of these holding fire extinguishers in my Jeep for 3+ months.  They work great.  I haven't' experienced any problem with the straps/threads tearing loose.
B005MKQKXY|5|I bought a pair in the color gray (more of a charcoal) for my Subaru Forester.  They are designed with German stitching on the sides to allow your side airbag to deploy. It was easy to fit it over my headrest and onto the seat.  The pouch in back is for folding over and stuffing in extra on top if your seat is short, but since I didn't need it for that I use it as a convenient drawstring pocket instead!  It is supremely comfortable in both hot and cold weather.  I agree with a previous reviewer, it is a good idea to hang it up and air it out for a couple of days before installation.  It does have a slight smell of chemicals at first.  After a couple of days, though, that was all gone.  I will definitely buy more of these when needed.
B00BR1TO80|5|This item has exceeded my expectations. I've used it for manning, starting cars, pouring garage equipement and inflated flat tires. no issues, has worked flawlessly.
B001C4SL4U|5|Fit perfectly
B00BZVYM98|5|Excellent product. Was able to program it in less than one minute. Highly recommend it.
B0035J82X0|5|I ordered this for my husband and he absolutely loves them.  We ordered these for our 2004 Silverado 1500, and my husband said that they were easy to install and the sound is great.
B000EA5WLS|5|Read the instruction, it is very clear and easy to understand. I had about 1/2\\" star shape chip, it took more like 6-8 drops of resin in order to be effective for the plunger, it is better to use more than less, otherwise the cracks will not have enough resin. The spillover is easy to wipe off with paper towel. I used CFL black light ($5 from Home Depot) as UV source. Most of the star cracks are completely gone, but the impact site is still there (a dot on the windshield, not too bad). You can buy from Walmart, about the same price.
B000GV4NZG|5|Picked this up due to the great price and knowing that Suomy makes quality helmets.  Read that people usually end up buying a size larger than normal, so since xxl was my normal size went with the xxxl figuring I could replace the padding to make it a xxl if needed.  No need, it fits just fine.  Since this is a race styled helmet, it is made to conform closely to your head (including cheek area), but I'm not picking up any pressure points.  It is very aerodynamic which I like since my bike has no windscreen.  It does have some wind noise at highway speeds, but has nice air flow inside.  Most impressive is that I've had it out in weather in the 50's and have had no fogging issues so far.  I think the design looks even sharper in person than what the pictures show, nice finish and sparkle to it.  Fairly lightweight too, but feels solid.  Very pleased with this purchase so far.
B0067MFQ1S|4|Really well made and solid.  As disk locks go, I can't imagine wanting more.  The alarm is a little trickier.  When I put in the batter, and put the alarm in place, I couldn't get it to turn off.  It would beep or whatever, like the instructions said it would...but then the alarm just fires off again.  Maybe I'm missing something?  I'm guessing I need to remove something from the sensor?  Frankly, I haven't taken the time to fuss with it.  Other than that, I'm really happy with it as a lock.<br /><br />Once I take the time to figure out the alarm thing, I'll update my review.
B000IYSK64|5|I bought this condenser motor for my wife's '99 Honda Accord, and it is a perfect replacement.  Although it is slightly smaller and may not last 12 years like the factory item, it mounts just like the OEM version, has a connector that matches up perfectly to the wiring harness, and operates without any problems.  And it costs substantially less than the OEM part.  Definitely buy this motor!
B00EJ4LPGG|5|Great non DOT helmet!! Fits great, nice cushioning inside. Recommend.
B004YA2726|5|So good this car beauty accesorie. You put this on your tires and using The key, you can be sure they won't be stolen. In ddition The key is your key holder! For me five stars!...
B0066R5DQW|5|Great product quality! Shipped super fast. Thank you, gus!
B003U8ZZKY|5|The item I ordered was exactly what I wanted. It installed easily and works perfectly. It looks and works just like the original equipment mirror.
B00FAIBCOK|5|Was a nice gift for my son's new car.  He really liked it. I ended up getting one for my car!
B002Z311MQ|5|This was a great find. Much cheaper than all other online stores. This is a must have for the Ford (Superduty's) 6.0L's. I highly recommend this purchase. Thank you!
B010PZXZL0|5|Great product
B000CIPUR8|1|This fluid didn't not work for my car...I bought it hoping it would work. I followed instructions to the letter. Not worth buying (my opinion)
B00ILXLMCS|5|nice for gf's son car he loves it
B011NNZYJE|2|Edges were too fat to fit into any panel seams I needed to remove on a 2016 WRX.
B000H6P55W|5|owned for over 3 years and have made over 6 long trips with it and no issues at all.  When I purchased it I was just hoping that it would make it through the first trip, and honestly I would of been happy if it brought my stuff back home dry that one trip, but after all this time it shows almost no wear and tear at all.  The zipper works great and the ties hold it very secure to the roof.  I'm overly cautious and use additional straps to hold it in place.
B000CE9EXI|3|Just be careful and don't let it drop.  I accidentally let it touch the window and it stuck RIGHT AWAY so I had to peel it off and when I did that it ripped.  Oh well, just be careful.
B0061R32JC|5|Everything about it was perfect.
B009FU7FP4|3|Shocks work good<br />mounting stud is garbage removed and put grade 8 bolt in its place.
B009R57LBU|5|It is so fun to drive around with these on. Loved it when we drove past a little girl in a parking lot and she got this great big smile on her face and started pointing out our car to her father. They stayed on great. Too bad next Christmas is so far away.
B00AU5N6II|2|item was delievered to me with cracks in it
B00LHMWQXO|1|Are you kidding me!! How loud of a whistle (not a click) do you need? Then it lasted about 2 minutes and quit.. Not happy.
B005H49GTA|5|works good for the price
B000CFRZHE|4|This receiver cover is very nice looking and well made. I gave it 4 stars because it is held in by 2 triangle shaped wires instead of an actual shaft. It holds firmly and does not rattle.
B0012PTAJY|4|The shocks work great even though the direcections were wrong.  The correct directions for a 2004 buick lasabre is unhook the factory air shock lines that snap on the air shocks,  remove the snap on fittings from air lines use the threaded fitting and 2 rubber orings on each shock,  When installing the air shocks through the trunk reuse the rubber fittings.
B000E35V5C|5|I bought this when slid on black ice into the curb for an exit off of route 78 east in NJ because the mechanic said it would be cheaper if I ordered the parts and had the shipped to him. However this dip$s*** did not realize I had a blown head gasket so after ordering this and condenser, and radiator he took forever calls me says all fixed, 10 minutes later in the bank drive through my muffle is spitting out a vapor screen like a james bond car, turns out it was engine coolant coming out my muffle like smoke. I am sure they were good parts and would have worked if my mechanic who no longer will touch any of my cars knew what her was doing.
B006BFTO8W|1|Amateurish home printer job - not professional quality. Not really yellow either; more like baby-sh-t green. And not worth returning either because of the low price and the 20% restocking fee, so right into the recycle bin it goes, smiling sickly green all the way.
B000O7H8FE|5|Replaced vent and drain plugs on my Mercruiser Alpha One outdrive. These worked good and replaced my old worn out plugs.
B0032J1KAK|3|It's true. These are great mirrors that really do the job, but the tape doesn't last more than about 3 months. I caught mine before they fell off in traffic. Check them frequently and replace when they start to loosen.
B00CCIM1YQ|5|Great bike lock.  A little heavy but the peace of mind makes it worth it.
B0021GI47M|5|I gave them to my husband for Christmas ... Best gift he loves the fit and feel!
B001A05E3C|5|Excellent replacement, saving me a lot of money!  It fits, was easy to install and looks great.  Many thanks to you!
B002UL4JAY|3|I bought the princess car seat covers/mats/steering wheel cover for my 16 year old's car.  They are very cute but the quality isn't great.  After several months there is still a really strong smell and I can't stand driving her car with the steering wheel cover on because that smell gets all over my hands.  The front seat covers fit ok but the back ones are a joke.  We ended up taking them off after just a week.  Didn't fit properly and wouldn't stay on.
B007D06F9U|5|I had no car or any vechile of my own so this is great start for those don't have a lot of money to spend on a used car, plus its great on gas. speed may reach to 35 to 40mph due to wind weather. but I recommended it for those who don't have transportation of there own.
B001FI3NRS|5|Worked like a Charm and saved me 115$
B000FRLO9Y|5|I'm pretty obsessed with battery life/longevity in general, and car batteries are not an exception. CTEK is the brand most popular with OEMs for their battery maintainers, and even though this is an older model it is still current, and has sufficient amps to charge a battery without taking forever.<br /><br />Definitely a solid recommend.
B00OZVOGL4|5|I replaced the Dorman 911-630 charcoal canister today in my 2002 Toyota Camry LE 2.4L 4 cylinder. -The Amazon Website Fitment Tool says it will not fit but it does. -You can validate that searching at other online parts stores. -In the box the charcoal canister is shipped in, is a Dorman cut sheet that indicates to change out a hose to a different one (provided). The one installed on the canister and in the Amazon advertisement photo shows the smaller crookedly one already installed that fits my 02 Camry. The cut sheet indicates it will fit: a. 2000-04 Toyota Avalon b. 2000-01 Toyota Camry c. 2000-02 Toyota Solara Changing out the additional hose, the 911-630 can be used on the following applications (photo of hose to change out shown on the cut sheet page): a. 2001-02 Lexus ES300 b. 2002-03 Toyota Camry There are a couple of pretty good videos on line to show the work to be done. It took me about 4 hours in the driveway lying on my back but I did take my time and had to do some online research for two hose lines I didn't remember where they went. Not the easiest job unless you have it up on a lift. I'd rate it 2 out of 4 for difficulty and 3 out of 4 for aggravation (disconnecting lines and electrical connectors). -Make sure you use jack stands -Mark or take a photo of the hoses before you remove them so you know where they go back -Replace any hard or dry-rotted hoses with new same size hoses Tools -  Common Metric 3/8&#34; and 1/2&#34; Metric Socket set with extensions and breaker bar -Make sure you have a 14MM deep well socket with your other metric tools to drop the Driver's side cross-member and some other bolts  Oh so far so good - much better than paying big bucks at the dealers. Good luck - have fun!
B00HRSTQ30|5|They look sick. Work perfectly
B000HEBR3I|4|The product worked fine as described. I have a back problem and the pump facilitates the transfer of gasoline from the can to the car. Good product!<br /><br />Heinz
B005CLMYIS|4|I have yet to install it knowing it too will eventually break since it is all plastic construction. However it was very cheap with free shipping.
B00A2VHM1W|5|As expected
B0038BBHNM|2|the lights are very nice looking. the driver side fitted good but the passenger side did not good at all. could not the brake light on one side to work at first.
B006ISNSBQ|4|Good item
B0088P06AS|5|great for small applications and quick disposal without any necessary cleanup! It's great for quick patches on the go or just keep a few on hand.
B007KICX7I|5|Perfect fit
B005TQN81I|5|I purchased this bag due to an upcoming cross-country trip (by air).  I not only use a walker, but also needed to rent a Portable Oxygen Concentrator for my trip.  This bag is wonderful!!  It hung on the top bar, just like the picture shows, AND with the handle on top to carry it by, it also served as a carry-on bag which fit quite nicely under the seat.  It was roomy enough to hold the 5 extra batteries for the POV, 2 battery chargers (AC and DC), my medications in a 2-wk-individual-day-pack, my cosmetics in their quart-size bag, a book for entertainment during the flight, and a clutch-type wallet with my driver's license, checkbook, credit cards, etc.  The fabric is strong, and the bag is very well made.  I LOVE it, and highly recommend it to anyone using a walker, especially one who might need some extra space for carrying small items. It certainly adds to one's independence!![[ASIN:B005TQN81I Classic Accessories 62-002-011001-00 Zippidy Deluxe Walker Organizer]]
B00DBEMVMM|5|Awesome Product, Easy Install and they shine better than regular light bulbs for sure! If you are looking for LED's, these are the ones!
B006X1UB68|1|This boot came with my band new convertible and the dealer has to replace already after only a month due to issues with the seals not holding. The series are peeling up. They should use some quality adhesive.
B002OUMVWY|2|I'm told this is the best hose on the market for its purpose, and the design would seem to support that claim.  Amazon certainly has the right price compared to our sources.    Having said that, I have ordered two of them thru Amazon (one replacing the other), and found both to have numerous nicks on the outside of the hose which expose the metal slinky like wire that allows rigidity & facilitate  contraction/expansion of the hose.  (7 places in one hose, 3 in the other)    An earlier review claimed the fittings weren't glued.  I'm not sure if the product has been redesigned since that review, or if the user was unaware.  The hose is designed to insert into the fittings and lock on, via a bezel.      As for my chief complaint, the nicks which expose the wire, I suspect I can repair them using some sort of plastic filler, but it is not what I would expect of a new product.   At the price Amazon is able to sell them at (compared to other outlets), it makes me wonder if Amazon doesn't realize they are selling seconds, or is this in fact the normal quality of the product.    I'm not at all surprised that some of the reviews indicated the hose had pin hole leaks.
B0069V8XRQ|1|Amazon needs to come up with a negative start system. These are the biggest POS's I have ever encountered. they all broke upon installation. I am selling the car that these were intended for and now I have to explain to the buyer why the car is is spending thousands of dollars on doesn't have hubcaps.  I am not going to bother trying to return them because it's only $44. I will, however, warn people off about this company. Terrible product!! DO NOT BUY!!!!
B00687LQL6|5|Perfect fit, works great.
B001KQ43AG|5|I put hese on my regular cherokee, not grand, by grinding down the eye studs to make these fit. Jeep now rides like a country cadillac and clears my 33&#34; tires much better when wheel is turned.  HUGE improvement over the factory XJ cherokee arms.
B001C3VQKW|5|AWESOME GREAT THANKS
B000WK515C|5|The art of lethal threat is one of the best out there! Their products are of the finest quality. I even bought a blank skate board and use one of their bigger decals as design. I have been asked where i bought the board!
B003HGPBQ2|5|Amazon says this doesn't fit my car but they have no idea. All you have to buy is ARP stud kit number 100-7201 GM 60* V6 Rocker Stud Kit. They also don't have to be modified to fit like blocky aluminum rocker arms. These will clear the back of your intake manifold.
B00173U7D4|5|Great in keeping ants away...they hate the scent of orange.
B002O006VM|4|good product and concept. key is hard to get in especially with gloves on.
B0032DBQHS|5|Very well built, and is very sturdy.
B001AIZ5HY|4|I thought it worked really well.  I even did two car headlights and had solution left over that I can use for a second &#34;coat&#34;.
B0002AJR8E|5|I don't have drain the oil....Very clean.. I such suck the oil out of the filler pout
B001CK4BVQ|5|Very functional, good quality.
B00E0NSL54|5|Yay, no more bug guts, and no hard scrubbing!
B00064SFJI|3|Is good, but it could be better if it comes with 2 wires to make an x tide.
B00FT69VXC|5|I love this set. It fits to a T in my old Camry. And very confortable.
B004TDMVWO|3|Other than that, so far they have been true and problem free. I am concerned with premature wear though. The country of origin would have been nice to know.
B000182F0Y|4|I have been using these for years so that I can keep the windows open slightly, even in the rain. These are better than the tape-on ones outside on the window frame as they go inside the window frame & are made better. One problem is that being inside the window frame, it activates the automatic child-release window switch until the sun expands the shade after several days of being installed. I think it would cause an inconvenience if you installed it in the middle of winter temperatures.
B000NZUTQW|5|Happy with my purchase
B004HJAS7K|4|It is a greta fit and size even if you have small hands it has a weird feel to the melted felt velvet whatever material it is to give some grip[ I hope that wears in a little smoother, but overall a good item if you want the design
B00CGRX6RE|4|easy to use and works great.  I definitely feel a slight increase in power.
B002XA0ZJQ|5|This looks great on my car! I am very happy with this purchase! It was very easy to put on and stay on great
B00SELNGW6|1|did not work
B000TE46SY|1|This timing light only costs about 10 bucks on Amazon, so I wasn't expecting the absolute best regarding build quality, etc.<br /><br />I did, however, expect it to last more than 3 minutes. Until now, I wasn't aware that they made disposable timing lights.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour, DON'T BUY THIS !!!<br /><br />I'm going to go look for a good one now. You should do the same.
B00JAXU6MU|5|minty fresh good product.
B00L841RIQ|4|my cuz love like them
B006FD3594|5|This Item arrived quickly and is working just fine on the 2000 Polaris Sportsman 500.
B004CF2SDQ|5|It fit like a glove and works great,I highly recommmed the companys product it made me love my t4actor again.tks
B0031EL7TA|1|I bought this winch over a year ago and wanted to really give it a chance before I said a word about it. Ok when I bought it; it was shipped to me fast which was nice. I put the winch on my truck to use with farm work. The main use for it was to hook to my hay spike. The out of box winch wouldnt pick up a 1100lb round bale of hay, it put tension on it and it would stop. Letting the tension off sometimes you had to beat on it to unhang its self then it made the worst sound you could think of for a winch. Ok so yes Im saying the winch sucked. Customer service was great I believe its still the same company. It did take them awhile to get around and do something but they sent me new motors new gear drives and new solinoids. The last batch of parts they sent me I finially was able to pick up a bale of hay so I gave up. I bought this winch to replace a 10000lb winch I bought from the cummins tools truck that I broke. I fixed the 10000lb winch and use it still for my hay because its faster and works better the 17500lb winch I have on a trailer to  pull cars on it, using the extra blocks I have though. Oh and thats just for cars also, I have a tractor that weighs 14000lbs and using the extra blocks thats 3 total; the Recon 17500lb still wouldnt pull the broke down tractor on trailer, but guess what the 10000lb cummins tool truck winch did, it was grunting and growling the hole time and I had to take breaks to let it cool but it did it atleast. I havent got stuck yet but unless its something small like a jeep I dont think this winch will pull you out.
B000GZEU64|5|When I found out what the dealership was going to charge for this, a friend of mine found these online. The same thing as what the dealership was going to use, at a much better price.
B000V2SVFS|5|Easy to install with the correct adaptors and a good RV filter...
B000C918I2|5|Fit perfectly to front part of the exhaust and nicely to the new tail pipe.  Quiet as OE!  Nice!
B0043M6C58|5|Thanks alot
B00BTHFWSI|1|Terrible burned out in two months
B000CSQEV4|5|Worked great.  Car runs better than ever
B005BTOR40|5|Just like the original; strong and sturdy.  This is a great product for Isuzu owners, especially those owners who are picky (like me) and want their vehicle to look like new.
B0009OMYAQ|4|I purchased this socket to remove and tighten the oil canister on my 2006 Pontiac G6 4-cylinder motor. Although it fits the hex my problem is with engine layout because the clearance between the filter canister and engine compartments is not enough. I am forced to crank from an awkward angle resulting in not completely fitting the cap. It is doable and does the job, but you have to be careful not to strip the hard rubber canister hex top. If a quality, lower profile socket can be found then give it a try, none were at the local stores that could even fit in the tight space like this one.
B000COBLPC|5|Very bright and clean. I used this product little more than 3 months but there is nothing to complain about it. Love it.
B005FFEFB0|5|Fast shipping. Worked great. Solid fit.
B00Q4YQBGI|5|Feels like it's very good quality, love the soft bristles- they are perfect for washing any type of vehicle. I'd definitely recommend!
B00K7XNEE4|5|Great cover! And it fits perfectly. The only thing that bothers me is how big the word Jeep is - kind of embarrassing BUT it does the job! So overall, I love it!<br />Delivery time was exceptional.
B002LWQ4HS|5|worked perfectly 2004 Mazda 6 V6
B00CEXKB8M|1|Does not fit correctly. Driver window hits plastic and cracked. Passenger plastic hit windows as well when rolled up. Also plastic moves when window is rolled up and down.
B005CLMYOW|5|I needed to replace the tailgate handle on my Ford Ranger for the 3rd time. I couldn't remember where I purchased the last one (it was an online store, still can't remember). Did some research on Amazon, found this suppler, and bought it.  Package arrived in one piece, and the handle was intact. This repo handle fit perfectly and has been working for the past few months.  I'd recommend this part and supplier, and will use them again for the tailgate handle if I need to replace it for the 4th time.
B004HOJYRK|5|Good product at a great price.
B000ZRVYO4|5|A very nicely machined tool set with a deep polish, the flexing elbow is another great idea but I wish I could find a metric set.
B007RRSZQ0|5|Came quickly and was a nice fresh new touch up paint
B002M4GMI6|4|Firstly - price factors in greatly in the 4 stars i'm giving this.  Were it priced inline with thule or yakima - it would get failing marks.<br /><br />That said - it's a good, solid rack and the price is unbeatable.  It's very low profile, and allows for some secure mounting points without attracting a ton of attention or looking like an apocalypse mobile. The included mounts work equally well with my wrx and jeep (different shaped crossbars) - the mount design is good for a large variety of crossbar types (round, oval, square, etc)<br /><br />So.. now to the not so great (but not unexpected for the price)<br /><br />Assembling.  Do yourself a favor - use a hex bit and a drill. otherwise it'll take forever. It arrives in a thin box, with each bar and screw separate. I used some threadlocker on each screw to make sure it never vibrates loose. The included locknuts should prevent that, but as small as they are, they don't present a lot of surface friction to keep things in placel.<br /><br />Powdercoating: Very thin.  The first few loads i carried up there left scratches to the metal.  A rack is supposed to carry things, a thicker coating would have been nice.  I took it off, primed it with a self etching primer, and sprayed it with some plastidip - a rubberized spray paint.  Put on a few good thick coats.  I'm not saying everyone should do this - a quick touch up spray would have sufficed... but this did the trick for me and i'll likely not have to worry about it again.<br /><br />Use:  It's noisy.  There's an odd harmonic frequency at speed, and it hums like a tuning fork at certain times (62mph = hummmmmmmmmm)  - At first i used bungees wrapped over-under style with the supports, and that quieted it...  i later got a wind fairing (I opted for an Inno medium size) and that made the biggest difference.<br /><br />So - this is looking more and more like a 2 star review - but I still give it 4 stars because it was very inexpensive, and with a few additional steps on my part, is the rack that best suits my needs at any price.  No one else makes a low profile rack that suits my needs (yakima's ultra low profile basket is much lower gauge metal - a metal wire-basket in fact - much lower weight handling and not as sturdy as this one)y part, is the rack that best suits my needs at any price.

B00DUDTXUW|5|A perfect match to the original! Saved us a lot of money!
B004C443PI|1|HORRIBLE MADE GLOVES. LOOKS LIKE MY NEICE DID THIS IN HER KINDERGARDEN CLASS
B006LJB7EM|5|It has been working great
B00IMWOK5Y|4|looks like its going to be a perfect fit ,workmanship looks good,shipment was on time, engine is out and being rebuilt can't try out til engine comes back .
B0000AX5X5|5|super comfy, easy to fit, brought to burning man and worked wonders!
B003C5VOGY|5|This is the coolest thing in the whole wide word im going to buy 100 more so i can stick them everywhere wow idk how i lived my life without this product every one should buy one these are so clever and funny LMFAO this is a true statement and the dcow people did not did not ask me to say anything that is not true
B006OQ35GU|5|Great view of the $&@! As it comes out to ensure the tank is clean. Not as interesting as it sounds.
B00067BWBI|5|I replaced my wimpy Civic horns with these and I am very happy with them!  They are much louder and demand attention!!  Great price too.
B00HHHNFME|3|First  the bad. Mazda changed the rear motor mount for the 1st generation Mazda 6 a few times. This mount WILL NOT WORK for an 03 or 04. It may work on a later model year but I am not sure. Either the Anchor 9221 or Westar EM 9221 mount with the triangular bracket on the small end of the dog bone is the correct part for an 03-04 Mazda 6S.<br /><br />The overall quality of the part appears decent.  If this is the correct part for your car I am sure it would be just as good as the OE mount. Just make sure this mount will work for your application before you order.<br /><br />In addition when I ordered this part before finding out it was not correct for my application it was shipped and arrived very quickly and communication with the seller once I was able to determine it was incorrect was fast.
B000C7M6HG|5|Best OEM replacement, it fit perfectly into the fan with a five minute install job; well worth it!
B001C8YQMM|3|I put these pads on the front of my 2006 Honda Odyssey.  Wow do they stop!  Nice smooth modulation and very stoppy.<br /><br />I got 12,000 miles out of a set.  These probably weren't what I should have bought.  I am now trying a set of the EBC green to see how they do.
B001MXTOKQ|5|These products are the only ones I was able to get my motorhome wheels cleaned with.  The wheels are so bright in the sunlight it almost hurts your eyes.
B000BRESDM|4|Its looks good and its bright. Have to be careful with the wires though.
B008AH4YB6|5|I ordered mine on the 8th of august and received it on the 14th (i live in Holland) i just came back from holiday a couple of days ago so i couldn't install it on my car earlier so today was the day.<br />I tried it today and noticed that on of the longer strips his Red leds didn't work so i contacted the sellers and they are sending me a new one this monday so don't doubt to buy this product its great..<br /><br />Al en al a great product with super bright Led's and a great service for sending me a new strip.
B003RQBKLC|5|When you have your phone, wife's phone, MP3 player, and 2-way radio you even fill up this puppy. Love the way it lights up too.
B00630IZYO|2|The car air freshener itself works. But there is NO WAY that the scent packs are made from essential oils. They may have a drop added to them but they are pure fragrance. They all give me a headache and stink up my car so bad that I have to air it out after. I would suggest just buying the diffuser, throwing out the scent pads, and adding your own essential oil blend mixed with a carrier oil (to make the essential oils go farther) from a dropper bottle (that's what I do- coconut oil, lemongrass and lavender are perfect) to some refill pads. It smells infinitely better.
B000CCZ50G|5|I purchased a 93 mark viii and had immediate problems with the air ride.  All of the air struts leaked, and replacing them at approx $200 ea (front more, rear less) did not guarantee a solution.  Chances were almost 100% I would need a new compressor and dryer for another $250.00.  So, the repairing the air system was not practical.  I then began looking for alternatives.<br /><br />There are best I can tell 4 companies that make conversion kits.  All of the kits if including rear shocks sell from about $700 and up, without rear shocks, about $550, and another $60 on shipping.  Amazon had the monroe kit for 431$ with free shipping.<br /><br />The kit arrives in 3 boxes, two boxes contain one front each, the third contains the two rear and the shocks.  I did not have any problem getting the right parts, or incomplete kits.  The first one was perfect.<br /><br />The appearance of the parts was exceptional.  They were all covered in a heavy black coating, and contained very clear instructions to uninstall the air, install the springs and how to PROPERLY disconnect the air system from the computer so no errors are generated.  Its a couple of wires, and some of the online kits said to pull a connector.  The monroe kit said snip a few specific wires.  I was very impressed by this.<br /><br />The installation went very smoothly, taking me about 3 hours to perform.  I am no super mechanic nor do I have a lift. I used a floor jack and hand tools just like most people would.  I had no problems.<br /><br />After it was installed, the car sat about 24\\" off ground (specs) which was within lincoln specs.  I drove the car and had a squeak, but some silicone lube got rid of that.  It handled much better, didn't feel as soft and mushy as it did with air, and so I am very happy.<br /><br />I would wholeheartedly recommend this kit over any of the others.  Its from a reputable company who obviously has the resources to perform the R&D to make the specs right/components right, and will stand behind any issues.  You may not get that from a small suspension company.<br /><br />I hope this helps, do not feel intimidated or reluctant about making this conversion.  Air is not practical due to cost, and doing nothing is not pracitcal.  Mine would leak out so the car was rubbing on all four wheels.  It is not driveable if the air system fails.  Even if brand new it could fail, and for that reason, I would only use the springs.from a small suspension company.

B009PVAYY2|4|worked out great
B004GCP1BG|5|Good deal
B003VZLJFG|4|Pros: Works very good, the yellow color on the lights has disappeared. All the fluids are sufficient.<br /><br />Cons: Sandpaper is very less, and I cannot see the lights clearly, the one point is for that.
B0091VCI86|5|As the sole driver of my Toyota, the driver's side floor mat was the only one that was getting wear and tear ... and boy was it worn and torn!  The first problem was to find only a driver's side mat replacement.  No luck.  The next problem was to find something less than the full four mat set.  I found several sources.  Toyota's offer was priced out of sight but, of course, you are paying for the Toyota name on the carpet.  Searching the internet, I found a two-piece (both front sides) set for more than $100.  Then I found the FH Group offer and it was perfect!  Only slightly more than a THIRD of the best price I was able to find for comparable quality ... and with no shipping cost!  And, even more wonderful, the set arrived today - a full day earlier than the earliest projected arrival date!  Lotta exclamation marks so far ... all deserved.  Box opened, mats installed perfectly, and now I can again look down and see comfortable support for my driving feet.
B00230CAOO|5|Works on old 2 stroke mopeds and small displacement motorcycles.  Always good to keep one on hand to have a ready replacement.
B0033B7VPK|4|Works great with my battery tender outlet that I have hooked up to my bike. Anytime, anywhere. Awesome!
B0034CMT6O|5|I received my heating oil tank lock today, and I am very impressed by the design and engineering that went into it.  It is seriously heavy duty; industrial quality.  The locking mechanism has a very positive action.  The inside of the cap has a gasket to seal the cap to the filler pipe.  All aspects of its manufacture are of the highest standard and it works perfectly.  Great value.  This lock should deter thieves and vandals, and protect my property.  In buying the Heating Oil Tank Lock, I feel that I have exercised due diligence to button up a hole in my home security.  Thanks to Flow Security Systems for providing this product.
B00877SL2M|4|good plug and play. look's good. should have free shipping.
B00PA2LMVY|5|I've been a Griot's user for years; their products have never disappointed me and this one didn't either.  I have a collection of classic cars and I usually detail them myself.  I've found this Griot's car wash to be a fine choice as a general car washing soap.  It suds well and, most importantly, rinses off nicely without leaving a residue.  It's a nice product that I will continue to use.
B009EBU75O|4|This product getting four stars because the name of the product is misleading. If you are buying this to fix a sticky temperature control knob and the black cable is not broken, this will solve that problem and you'll be have a leftover with a blue cable that controls vent choice. If your black cable is also broken, you will also need the part MR979515, which is the OEM cable for the temperature adjustment. The blue cable provided is too long and will not fit. Overall, the transaction was positive, the product came very quickly and contents were as described.
B00HRXG3E0|3|I was mildly excited about this.  The material is nice, think and well coated to be waterproof and the camo print looks nice on the Rhino.  However, 1 of the 4 straps used to attach it to the rollcage was not even stitched.  We opted to just stitch it ourselves and not send it back, but I'm disappointed that the quality control on this product did not catch this.
B00029WYEY|5|Same stuff you're get at the local store except cheaper here. Product exactly as described and I much prefer the oil spray to the drip oil.
B0093NAAY6|5|Easy install, works well
B000C3YT4I|5|K&N has always made awesome equipment! This was my first cold air/ram kit that I purchased from K&N and it was incredibly easy to install. The entire removal of my old air intake assembly & installation of the K&N short ram kit took about 30 min. I've definitely noticed a slight improvement in my pickup & acceleration on highway on-ramps, I have also noticed a slight improvement in my overall fuel economy (approx. 1-2 mpg avg.) K&N made another solid product that does exactly what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />Another note, there's no noticeable increase in engine compartment noise unless I'm putting my foot down on the on-ramp. Don't let the statements that it makes your car sound loud scare you. I'm in sales & need to be able take customer phone calls. I wouldn't have installed it if I thought it was going to interfere.<br /><br />Best/Most cost effective bolt-on improvement you can get for a Honda Civic! Get one if you don't have one already!
B00CB8WM2S|5|I bought the car hammer for 2 reasons: 1 to help anyone in my car escape after an accident and 2 to help a person, child or pet escape another hot car. I feel safer having it with me.
B0078U8SJ0|5|Product as described. I've bounced it on a few rocks and haven't busted it yet...
B0063GKHPI|5|Buy this product.<br />I was try this product for my headlight on the 1/27/14, It is the best and fast, you don't have to buff .
B00029KA8G|3|Very difficult to make a proper fit.  No matter how hard he tried, my husband couldn't get this cover to smoothly grip our steering wheel.  The end result was very dissatisfying after spending a couple of hours on the job.
B003BZWR4S|5|can't go past this one,extremely sticky it won't disappoint the fussiest user.It's so good it's hard to get off the roll.
B00NB2XT6Q|5|This is a true most have tool in your car. Very compact perfect design, very use friendly, the extra cable to connect this directly in to the battery its a great help. Not noisy, don't get hot so over all I will give this new Kensun product a 100 plus!!!.
B000WJX4BQ|4|So far so good hopefully it lasts a few years.
B008MISDH4|5|Best price around when I purchased this for my Vulcan 1700 Motorcycle.  Top quality, full synthetic oil!
B0051D3MP6|1|I bought two and neither one worked. Must be selling rejected charges
B000BZ6YOK|5|I bought this for an '03  Ford Ranger with an 8.8 rear end, but this bearing came as a 3.0&#34; diameter and my truck takes a 2.25&#34;. I wished I could have used this bearing as it's superior to the National I ended up buying locally (at a higher price) as a replacement.
B000EDUUL2|2|Bought the stands for a tall Jeep project, these stands are NOT very stable at their max height. They have approximately 6 inch circle of movement at max height. However, at their lowest there is less than 1 inch movement. I tried to see if they were more stable with load and the Jeep fell, thankfully I had left the tires on for this test. This is why I sent them back.<br /><br />Otherwise they are well made and strong, just not for my project.
B001THQX1S|5|This tool works like it should.Very satisfied! its cool green design makes it very nice on the eyes get you one today you will be glad you did.
B003BLXVVU|4|Installation of the Wheelskin was pretty straightforward.  It looks kind of intimidating, but it just takes some time.  The end result is well worth the time and effort.  It can be a bit tricky around the spokes of the steering wheel, but if you keep pulling the cord tight, it looks great!
B000ZANAX4|5|Thick material, well fitted, three piece set. Will purchase again!! Only thing left is finding out the longevity of the material. It feels just like a wet suit. If you like wet okoles seat covers, you'll like these. Nice straps, well made.
B000E21CU6|5|buenos
B004BI5A98|5|I really like the size and the colors are great I just hope it doesn't fade?? I looks great on my truck!!
B00M0VMTPQ|3|The handle holder broke at first use.  The blade part worked well
B008YB7LY0|5|Everything you need.
B0013916XW|4|fit good
B0009J3R02|5|Fits nicely in the back of my XJ.  The Gray is not the same gray of the factory carpet, but its close enough for me.  Who stares at the cargo area anyway?
B006U9AM5I|2|End cap I received came in FMF packaging however it was severely bent at the top two mounting points. It was installed without problem but does not look clean like a factory cap. Also the spark arrestor screen (as pictured) is not included so be aware.
B006ODTU7G|5|These are genuine Honda all season floor mats, and they fit perfectly into my wife's CRV. The water and snow from this Winter was retained within the mats that can be easily removed and washed.  Note that they will only work if the existing carpet floor mats are removed.  I only purchased the front set since we rarely have passengers in the back seat.
B000A8FGPG|4|work well
B00E6Z108G|5|I loved it
B001O5RF1M|4|Read reviews before ordering & made sure to order correct one for my 2013 Dodge Quad cab. Order came & was correct. Was easy to install & looks great and @ a good price.
B002M6J6VO|5|perfect
B0031XULF2|5|Perfect!
B000A6VBZ2|5|Perfect fit in a 2001 F-150 XLT. One minute installation.
B00CA5PT8Q|5|I just ordered this key and went to get it programed a day they said it was a 50 percent chance for working. Luckily it worked and we are so happy. Thank you so much.
B00HSIKQ6U|1|It don't fit my truck.  Plus the turn signal don't work anymore.
B001BWE7BY|5|Installed in 20 minutes, love it
B000C34KV0|4|Well, it seems to work on my 2000 Crown Victoria, but makes a cyclical clicking noise which is audible at a stop light while at idle. That shouldn't happen. Next time I guess I'll have to pay twice the price for a Motorcraft direct replacement.
B0080N3AOC|2|I bought this one instead of the cheaper one because in the description it says high quality, but it is the same exact one as the cheaper one. The spikes are plastic not metal and snap off very easily.. Shipping was on time..
B006GFLI0O|3|This was too big for me to wear. I have an average size head (hat size 7) and the elastic on this fit fine, but it pulled down over my ears when I pulled it on. If you don't pull it down all the way you will look like a baker. I returned it.
B004SSAFTG|2|lasted 4 months lost water repellent and a tear.
B00BXUCWQG|5|Dear DROK and AMAZON<br /><br />Even though I couldn't see the status of the fuse from the outside, I opened it up and pulled it out.  It was blown.  I replaced it and the unit works just fine.  I truly appreciate the assistance and time you spent in working with me.  You can bet I will be buying more of the unique items from your site.<br /><br />And to quote what I had said in a previous Amazon Marketplace product:<br /><br />WE HAVE ARRIVED INTO A NEW ERA OF BUSINESS<br /><br />This dealer, \\"DROK\\"  has bent over backwards to please me.  And when it all came out, the product was perfect with a new fuse and I hope the seller and Amazon Marketplace don't create a ton of bad marks on me as a buyer.<br /><br />As I had said in a different product and different dealer:<br /><br />We are coming out of a century old phase of \\"sell it, even if it's broke and refuse a refund\\"  It is quite shocking to find business y caring about the satisfaction of the customer, which of course, keeps them coming back and word of mouth and internet praise.<br /><br />So, in two words:<br /><br />\\"Shockingly Pleased!\\"<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Peppi Turco
B000C8ZE74|5|perfect fit in the truck better then going to the exhaust shop
B000EQEQ32|5|Not much to say about these other then they fit in perfectly, with no problems what so ever. These are more or less oem.
B000C2AKEC|3|ok
B00AIJY2ZM|5|I've used several bulbs for my license plate and this one is worth the money. They last a long time and are a outré white color!!!
B0053YIKSC|4|Works great. Very good price. The more led modules the better. For my need they where perfect. Would tell a friend about this product.
B003VFNZEY|5|I bought these in a desperate attempt to round out my Christmas presents but I think it ended up being the favourite gift! The glasses fit snugly on the face so no teary eyes from the wind and no worries about bugs. The three shades cover all needs for the motorcycle enthusiast who drives in all kinds of weather, day and night. Great buy. Great price. Thanks for making me look good Amazon!
B000CF6RX2|5|I put these window vents on ALL my vehicles, and I use this brand exclusively! It takes all of a few minutes to install, and they last as long as...well, I don't know exactly, they are still going strong after 4 years on my older truck! Affordable and long lasting, you just don't find that much any more!
B008YFI27Q|5|Had a hard time finding, no one in our town sells and ordered on line.  The first order received one bottle the cap was completely off, several others loose and had a white mess inside the box.  The Amazon seller had no problem on reorder at no cost.  I noticed when the item was packed and shipped the inside box was laying on the side however was marked as ship standing up.  Good thing the interior box was wrapped in plastic.<br />For the ones that do the packing, they need to pay attention to the boxes when it says &#34;ship standing upright&#34; or similar information.<br /><br />BTW we do NOT buy Armor All, seems to only do a so-so job as opposed to an outstanding job with Son of a Gun!<br /><br />Son of a Gun is the only one to buy!
B00ISPK60I|5|Love the produced.  Good fit, easy install.
B006BBVXDA|1|S***,dosent start truck only used as a spare key
B0007OS6XC|5|Struggled with the choices on the light bar, smittybilt or kc.  Ultimately went with the kc which have my hella 4000's mounted. Looks great
B000C7VZGY|4|First off the radiator came very quickly but I think it should have been double boxed cause the foam<br />was damaged, Radiator was not.<br />It has the look of quality, not the cheap look came with adapter fittings for the oil lines so it<br />will fit even if GM decided to change size. We didn't need these but they are in the tool box<br />in case I ever need them on another job. It fit perfectly.<br />The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because the top neck does not have a raised<br />lip on the end and the hose didn't fit quite like it could have. Maybe someone installed<br />the wrong hose too. Good product , Only time will tell of the real quality<br />Overall , very happy so far.
B004ZKZ4AM|5|good job, all very nice
B000CNB5OK|3|Quality product. but I received them in black
B000KYXC1K|5|worked great. programming instructions<br />were correct.
B006L8I9VM|4|No complaints here.  It does its job and fits the trunk of my 2009 Corolla S perfectly.  Very high quality.
B00BMPFI6I|4|It's everything I expected and I don't have to worry about someone walking off with it because at 70# it's not exactly light. Seems like a good value for the ,money
B002R1RCTM|5|Great price and headlight kit for my 2002 Toyota. Quick shipping.
B009DJ8UE2|5|Works as advertised
B00802FXVG|2|was not the right conversion kit for my car
B009XIX6S8|5|This was a product that was bought by my son and he uses it almost on a daily basis. I was afraid it was going to be so dark he would have to change it for night and day but he states it helps with the sunlight but does not affect him when he uses it at night time. He can still use this dark faceshield at night. A+ Seller and packaged nicely for delivery.
B002P8HB66|5|I love it it's exactly what I need it thank you.
B000HVTERW|5|Brilliant. Wish I'd bought one of these years ago. Solid and just makes sense.
B00062YBTS|4|I ordered this kit in order to bring the 1406 up to a 1405 spec carb and then some.  Which it will do, but that is the limit.  Need another kit to actually take the 1405 base curve to higher performance.  Very pleasee with my 1406 which is now a 1405.  Really made the engine come alive, no stumble on hard accelerations.  Update:  FYI:  I went to the larger jet, smaller rod, appeared to pick up some performance in HP, but, while doing many miles on the Hot Rod Power Tour my milage went from 23 MPG to 15 MPG. (Very rich just cruising) First chance I changed back to the original jets and rods.  I did, against instructions, open the idle screws 1/4 turn beyond optimum set point and this almost completely reduced the stumble upon acceleration.  Sticking where I am as long as fuel is at $3.54 a gallon.
B0045MYEQ0|3|We bought this cover for our Chalet Arrowhead camper just over one year ago and it has now seriously deteriorated. We had placed Styrofoam covers over all eight corners of the camper to keep the cover from wearing through at those sharper points. We also used the cord provided to string under the camper to hold it more snug. We noticed some areas that had shredded a couple of months ago and actually used the cover's bag of the same material to make repairs, using a sewing machine. More shredding has occurred and so we are now going to try a more expensive Camco cover, this time strapping the top down as well as tying across the underside of the camper. We will write a review for the Camco after using it for a few months. The reason we gave this Expedition cover 3 out of 5 stars and not less is because we figured that a $50 investment for a year of camper protection is not that bad.
B00029WYVW|5|Cleaned filter with cleaners around the house...then sprayed with this cleaner and WOW. All the dirt that was missed came out with a simple rinse!!! Never use stuff 'round the house again!!! Great stuff!
B0002NIF70|4|nice
B008KZK4YE|5|Good as new- replace some old looking mats and like a new interior
B005PZMKZI|3|Good for price
B00ANZHG7C|5|I got the 24 pack because it was better value than the smaller ones and not much more money.  These are a good size and good quality. I keep finding new uses for these cloths. I use them for all my cleaning needs and as I have so many, then its simple just to toss them in the wash. They work really well for cleaning glass after you've washed them once.
B000AMZK2G|4|These are probably some of the easiest parts to replace. Just be sure you are working with a depressurized line
B000C3YTJI|5|Best filter out there, the nut at the end is super handy.
B00FPTMLLM|5|Legit product.
B005VTSWW8|5|An Exact replacement for my 2004 F350 super duty. Only took 5 minutes to install.
B000CIGDAG|5|High quality, additional capacity, drain plug and a bung hole to install the B&M transmission gauge. Easy install and the fit was excellent. I have always been pleased with B&M products that I have purchased for many years.
B0022ZYUS4|5|good product
B000OGXITK|5|Excellent
B003CGSUL0|5|Perfect for 5.0 resto mod fuel line conversion.
B00OZWXJKM|5|Great thank u!
B000EVWDU0|5|The picture on Amazon site is not correct. This battery monitor shows the voltage value with .01 precision (or two digits after decimal point). That is far more then enough to tell the battery status. I put it in the car, it automatically switches between &#34;battery status monitoring&#34; and &#34;charging status monitoring&#34;. When the engine is stopped, it is in &#34;battery status monitoring mode&#34;, when engine is running, it will be in &#34;charging status monitoring&#34; mode. Amazon's price is even better then Walmart. Definitely a great value buy. Will recommend this item to my friends.  --- Update --- Amazon has updated the new photo for the product. The picture is correct now.  --- Update 5/30/2016 --- Lately, my wife's car won't start. I plug in this battery-Charging System monitor and turn on the power. The monitor shows 11.65V. Right there, I know something is wrong either with the battery by itself or the car's charging system. At this voltage level, the battery won't have sufficient power to crank up the engine. A typical reading before turning engine on should be around 12.34V.   Nevertheless, I replace the old battery with a new one. The monitor now shows 12.30V when I turn on power. I drive around with the battery-Charging system monitor plugged in. I see voltage level is at 14.34V. That's good. This means the charging system is charging the battery.  After driving around for about 15 minutes. I turn off engine. The monitor now shows battery is at 12.74V (higher then the initial 12.30V) . This confirms the new battery is taking charge from the charging system when I drive the car around.  This battery-charging system monitor makes it easier to figure out if the battery goes bad or the charging system is not working correctly.  Most mechanic will ask for a $120 diagnostic fee to figure out what is going on first, then additional charge for fixing the problem. I just save myself $120 diagnostic fee with this battery-charging system monitor.

B00OK9LJ7U|5|Very Satisfied!! Delivery was exactly one week from purchase. Definitely impressed with my purchase.
B00NCH252Y|3|The mirrors are nice enough, but do not fit my 2002 Zuma 50 which as I found out, has a COUNTER CLOCKWISE screw. Now I am hoping the adaptor will work.
B000SARCAS|4|It is made in Germany. Works great on my VW GTI 2006 2.0T. Came as described. Good price. No complaints.
B000C2CKWW|5|Great price.
B0091XPJ4O|5|its such a helpful accessory to any vehicle..manufacturers should give this to all new car owners or even pre-owned ones
B003CJERXM|5|This a 32 hole Honda rim. The compatibility chart shows it is incompatible for a Honda, but the part number is correct. They would sell more if they corrected the chart and stated the number spoke holes in the description. Great price for a great rim
B003QUGPW8|1|We have very different definitions of &#34;lint-free&#34;. You just shake this thing and lint falls out like snow. Are people hired to give this thing good reviews (as if that's a new thing, I know)?
B000C75QC8|4|Like the title says, so far this has been a great replacement for my worn factory MC, but it was a bit of a pain to bench bleed with the included caps. If they had included a better tube/hose type bleed kit, it would have been much better. Fitment was great and has been solid thus far. Time will tell how it holds up.
B000GTXVEM|5|James Gaskets reputation is well known.  These gaskets were perfect for the rebuild of my 2000 Harley Road King. Properly coated, OEM fit and no leaks after install and many miles of use.  All the gaskets and seals I needed for bottom and top end rebuild of my 95ci engine. Cheaper than OEM gaskets also.
B0002NYDZ8|5|Not a mechanic but love this
B008BU3PF8|5|worked great light not as bright as the factory but it works good for the money, even light on both lens nice...
B005J3BPCK|5|Works as advertised.<br />Easy to use.<br />Very bright lights.<br />Excellent design -- works well.
B001DCN1SC|4|Fairly easy to install (about 30 minutes total for both struts), though it takes a little muscle to pop the struts in place. Price was less than half of what the dealership had quoted. I researched the product category online before buying, and am convinced that the StrongArm line is the best value (defined as quality relative to price). CAUTION: The installation instructions say to have a helper to hold the lift gate open while you replace the struts--this is NO JOKE. I thought that I had two bad struts, because the gate would slam shut. However, I found that I really had only one bad strut to replace, and that the one good strut had been slowing the gate as it slammed shut. I found out how heavy the gate *really* was after I took off the second strut. I used a 2x4 to prop open the gate while I worked, but would not advise this. Having a friend as a helper and spotter would be safer.
B000O3M5CE|5|Thanks
B000C944R4|5|GREAT VALUE
B000FPY6CI|3|Not that great and hardware is terrible.
B004I79QZG|1|Has about 10 different patterns, but it cycles through them,  i like the have one pattern while im plowing so that it doesnt distract me and i know whats to come.  Also its just LED lights which are bright, but i prefer to have just a regular whelen strobe loaded thats bigger than this.  DO NOT BUY
B000EDSSKW|5|A perfect fit for our  camper'a step. We have a viking popup, but I think the steps are all pretty standard. Very simple to install and looks great, it replaced the original which lasted 14 yrs.
B000A6VBZ2|4|Decent replacement,  fit the f-350 well.  Plastic seems thinner than oem.  But for the price it's good to go!
B004AH1YQS|5|If you live in Buffalo, you know that Delta Sonic is a necessity of life... and this was a great deal!
B00CSBWLZG|5|thank you for good parts
B0058U8MMK|4|Had know idea that the starter was this size. I have to say though, So far so Good... Arrived yesterday 7/22/13 and im driving gain today 7/23/13... Great price... The cheapest I found... Thnks
B007V37ERQ|5|These Mats Match the Brown interior of my car perfectly and the fit perfect also.
B009PIKHYW|5|I ordered these and was a little skeptical about how well they would fit. I mean a lot of places advertise the digital fit liners and I've gotten ill fitting ones before for previous cars.  I have a 2015 escape and these fit PERFECTLY.  Very easy to install and they look great!
B0030GR4JQ|4|I wanted this so my 2 sons could enjoy their own activities in our back seat (dvd player, games, etc). This adapter works great for that purpose. The only tiny issue I have, that is hardly worth mentioning because it is really not that big of deal, is it fits VERY snug into my car outlet. It does take some effort to get it in, and when I take it out, sometimes I feel like I am going to pull the car guts right out with it! But it is probably just my car!
B0002BC0T6|5|The telescoping feature is a plus. Makes it real easy to fit in my tool box. Very sturdy construction. I've used it on some old 40's and 50's car hoods, which are pretty heavy and have had no problems.
B0030GF2LI|5|Strong magnet for multiple use (taking off when not needed). I ordered a different type for the sides of our car but wasted my money on that one (beware of 6&#34; x 4&#34; white lettering, &#34;vinyl&#34; sticker......more like clear contac paper and card stock lettering). I will be throwing that one away and ordering 2 more of THIS product. This one is clearly seen and easily removed and put back on again. Looks much like the professional driving school decals. Would highly recommend this magnet.
B005FEGP7I|3|must already have software
B00A5RO6EE|5|Wish it was set up to put on the inside of your car window instead of outside. Other than that....awesome!!!
B001C9QX8Q|4|I've had 'em on for 3 months+ now and Definetly the ride quality increases. They're A LOT Firmer than the original 2008 Mazda3, kind of rough at first but they get comfortable as you use them. That's just how Gas shocks work, a lot more responsive, less head-tilting, less Body-roll of the car. The important thing is that they behave almost like a sport ride on the open Road and highway, No bouncing all the way through, adding a great new deal of control and Handling. Mine are the black ones, nice Patent-Black Gloss. Came with their own stickers, very good. No shock-Boots included. You can use the old ones, just be sure to give them a little cleaning-up before Re-using.
B00062YA44|3|Loos good.  Works well
B000MD4YKM|5|Hubby says it works great
B00NDIUE48|5|Love it
B008G28FDS|5|very nice
B000EQL0PO|1|This was advertised as a genuine AcDelco distributor. When I received it I found it to be a cheap aftermarket version. I was able to return it but I had to pay shipping both ways.....What a scam! After returning it I see they changed their description. BEWARE!
B00DC3V5EM|5|Works great, but would be better if the fabric were stiffer. Right now, the extender gets lost in the seat some times instead of remaining where it can be seen and easily grasped.
B002MBEA1K|3|The hose itself seems of very good quality.  However, the brass hose fittings last only about a year before springing a leak.  This is the second hose I've gone through in 2 years.  Does no company make a hose that will last more than a year without leaking?
B0084H9QME|2|Great smelling product, but fragrance only lasts about a day, and that's with using over 10 sprays at a time!! It should last much longer!
B000XQK0N8|5|These tips are actually 4\\" outlet tips with a 2.25\\" inlet.  They are very well constructed and are highly polished.  The length is actually 6\\", not the 6.25\\" advertised.
B00VAVSQHM|5|Took about 1 1/2 hours to install both. Improved ride in my 2001 Toyota, that has 316000 miles on it. I hope they hold up.
B00T62RK1U|5|Too soon to know how well they will hold up but in terms of effectiveness when used as reverse lights they rock.  Before installing them I disassembled one to check for gaskets or sealant and it appeared very well sealed, so well that I didn't bother taking the other one apart.<br /><br />One word of advice before mounting them: Get an Allen wrench and check the screws. I had 3-4 screws that needed at least a full turn or more to tighten up completely. Any loose screws will eventually result in condensation regardless of how they are sealed. Also put a smidgeon of clear RTV adhesive around the entry port for the wire.<br /><br />I bolted them under my 2010 F-150, soldered all connections and they lit up the neighbor's house 70 Ft across the street with a wide beam of brilliant white light. You couldn't possibly need a brighter or better light to improve your visibility when backing up in the dark.<br /><br /> Be prepared to be surprised.
B0089GTC92|4|They are definitely brighter and clearer than tungsten bulbs, and give greater back up light.  They are not spotlights though.  2000 Silverado.  I have ordered a pair for the DRL in the front, which seem to burn out all the time.  They are reportedly more durable.
B00B7ORHNG|4|Kind of expensive for what it is, but a good investment considering what I spent for the Elite-7 itself.  I don't understand why a sun cover isn't supplied with the Elite-7 in the first place.......or maybe, I do understand but don't like the reason....$$$$.
B001C9E4SM|5|Perfect fit upon install and no leaks.4 months have gone by in the Baja heat and all is good !
B007HO3RIO|3|The quality is not good. Poorly machined with rough edges and the emblem insert does not stay on, will have to be glued in permanently and may have to be damaged if the bolt needs to be removed. The product looks used.
B00K35UP52|4|Love the cover but there are some flaws. There is a rubbery smell and it gets onto your hands and it is hard to get into the steering wheel.
B0016LEAUI|2|Doesn't provide a long lasting shine like it claims.
B000AMBOIK|5|nice little charger for the price brought my bike battery back to life
B0023VKVV2|5|It was perfect. My husband was really happy with it.
B000C2GG5E|5|excelent for the price all ok
B002T433DG|5|I really like this helmet. fits kinda smallish, but you came beat this kind of quality for the price. Matches my bike nicely. Its all about visability out there among the cagers for me.
B00BCU60LK|4|good ,perfect fit!!
B00E1SNULS|5|OEM replacements (almost) for half the cost - what's not to like
B000VAW4LW|5|Perfecto... Works well and cheaper than autoparts
B00KJAZFRE|5|Excelent! It's the part to my Ford Fusion 2008
B0009IK87I|1|This blade DOES NOT FIT A 2007 CIVIC SEDAN.  Amazon says it does, but it does not.  The Civic takes different length wipers for the driver vs passenger side and they must be curved to conform to the windshield.  I had already torn up the packaging so could not return these.  I ended up going to O'Reilly and they installed the proper blades.  Should have done that in the first place.
B00B1UN4OW|4|Pleased with purchase.
B000COD1D2|5|did the job for my 99 jeep fog light repair
B00AMLNMJI|4|love this light works great
B001A0J2JO|5|fandamntastic...in my 57 chevrolet it is a must...it gives me full side to side panorama and no blind spots
B0002SR4RM|4|Great !!!
B0006O2S0U|5|Very pleased with the way this guage works.  Be aware that some gauges do not hold their settings when removed from your tire's valve stem.  This one holds the reading which is very nice for eyes that are not so young.  The bleed valve is also handy.
B00SDOEM8G|3|Lens replacements and brackets are perfect, and come with standard replacement halogen bulbs already installed. My fog lights were cracked, so I simply needed this for the lens replacements and were 1/4 the cost of Honda original.  I bought this kit thinking the HID upgrade would be a DIY, and it probably is - but without ANY instruction in the box I just plugged in the original bulbs that were pre-installed in the housing. HID upgrade kit is available if anyone needs just the kit!
B0042ZIT7U|5|Its nice but all the fold line are still there maybe when it gets hot it will lay flat
B008OGZJDA|5|Excellent!
B00MUYZM98|4|I got one of these about 2 years ago as a gift from my mother (she bought it on a black friday sale for $99).  It's a great tool to have if your vehicle is unreliable or even just as an extra tool in case of emergencies.  Problem is though if you lose the charger you have to make sure to get one with high enough voltage.  A regular charger that fits, will NOT charge it due to the voltage requirements.  Overall great though.
B00BEYD9LI|5|They were great and my boyfriend loves them. The mats are really sturdy and look just as they are pictured. Also, they can be cut if they are too big. I got them for a 2012 hyundai sonata and didn't have to cut them at all.
B00GRLC51I|5|Fast delivery and a very reasonable price
B008M1WK7A|5|Great fit,great quality
B000JFL7ZS|5|Thanks
B008AZDBJY|5|Fit as expected.
B00029WRMI|3|I was looking for a quick and cheap way to get street-legal before figuring out a longer term solution for my antique project.  these fit the bill, and are just as cheap and janky as I expected!  If I bump them with something in the garage they're coming right off...
B003WXPR78|3|its to wide so it takes a few times to open a bottle
B000UV8FNS|1|They are not the best!! Wire does not reach back seat!
B000CPCBEQ|5|Works great in Pontiac Vibe manual. Better than GM OEM at half the price.
B005HR2TM8|4|Looks great.
B001F79H4M|5|We own two, one on each car.  Better quality and better looking than the dealers holder.  An inexpensive way to have a little fun!
B00G6CTUZM|4|I would have given it a 5 star except the part did not match the description but my husband was able to make some adjustments and make it work...but it was not as described.
B008D6YGE4|2|Not very sturdy metal, makes annoying noise when turning. Ready to toss this one.
B00A0HGMPU|5|Fit perfectly and installation was incredibly simple with no tools or accessories needed. Just bend them a little bit to fit and they expand into place. They provide full window coverage unlike the factory-installed one in the tailgate.<br /><br />They also function almost like a privacy tint when trying to view inside the car from the outside which is a nice little bonus.
B009ZIMXLW|5|Looks good in my truck. Shipped fast and easy install.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Works perfect!
B003OHEA48|5|great product. love it.  just what I needed.  couldn't ask for better.  worth every penny.  best of the best. perfect.
B0002MBKAA|4|Bought this to replace the last one my husband had on his truck. The installation was easy (F-350) and the wheel cover fits well. He has been happy with it and driving with it for about a month now. I liked that it didn't stink like cheap rubber/plastic when it arrived.
B00GWWTFZ6|4|These mirror covers look really nice on my Liberty. The only complaint I have is<br />that they don't cover the existing mirror<br />completely.  There is about a 3/4 inch area that remains uncovered.  As my late Father would say in this situation,  &#34;A man running for his life would never notice. &#34;  I'm still glad I added these and the chrome door handles as well.
B000C847HW|4|It is confusing that the box that says it is an 188F. Of course i wanted the 195F so I almost returned it but then i did some research in discussion forums and one forum about saturn s cars says for the stant 1429 &#34;The initial opening point is 188F and full flow is ~212F, the 195F is the pint where all water is first directed through the radiator and the bypass is closed off. That is the correct part.&#34; So this is the right part for saturns. I installed it and it works perfectly. Now my gauge is reading the perfect running temperature. So the story ends well but there were a few problems along the way.<br /><br />First it was very hard to install and i had to file down the metal &#34;wing&#34; things that hold it just a little bit on each wing side to get it to fit. I do not know if you will have the same problem as me, because perhaps it was because my thermostat cover was not the original. Before i realized that this car needed a 195F, i was a fool and first bought a new thermostat that came already in a case cover (the cover is what the thermostat sits in where the hose goes in), So before i got this 195 I threw away the previous case cover which might have been the original case cover. I realized i needed a 195F when i went to discussion forum because i found it strange that when i first changed thermostat with the Oreily's replacement, the car was still running cooler than it should. So this 195 was hard to fit in the case cover i had from the oreily's that was with there wrong temp 85 theromostats. So maybe that is why the 195 did not fit with out some slight mod. Also i was a bit concered because the design of the wings were a bit different, but not so much that it would not hold once i did file them to fit the proper width to twist into place. So you might run into the same problem as me, since i bought this car used i think it already had been replaced with the wrong thermostat. The auto parts stores have in their computer the wrong replacement part.So you might also have the wrong housing.<br /><br />Not only that the gasket that came with this stant was slightly too big, so i reused the one that came with the oreilly's housing. This again could be because of the same thing described above. I also used a bit of red silicone which makes it easier to hold the gasket in when installing into the car.<br /><br />If you have no experience, Changing the thermostat is not that hard. One other thing is to make sure you are using a good socket and ratchet. You do not want to strip the bolts that can be hard to remove on some cars. And if you have the same prob as i did, you can use a file. Since other people seem to not have these issues i think it was not stant's fault but the fault of these autopart store suppliers.<br /><br />I highly recommend these 195F and the price on amazon was fair.
B001KQAAFS|5|Purchased from an Amazon supplier.  It was easy to install, works like a champ and 1/3 the cost of OEM from a Ford dealer
B00AZPRK1W|5|Same price as if you ordered direct from WeatherTech and faster shipping with Prime.  It's a no brainer!
B0001L0DFA|5|Perfect.
B000F0RFRG|1|My 2015 300s has a clock on the dash and none of your covers allow for it. If I buy one of these I would have to check the sun to tell time.
B000AMBOI0|5|I have used this on many batteries with good results.  Smokes and smells when new, but after the first use or two that will go away.
B00AZ4QT10|5|this product looks great on my scion 2006 it makes the vehicle look very classy.. was impressed . first box received had damage part in it but was imediately replaced from the company quickly .. also had the mail person pick up the damage parts before you can blink.. very impressed.. with company
B0001MQ7AO|1|Weak power.<br />Two weeks later the higher power only worked spreading cold air instead of hot air.<br />$48 dollars earned with hard work wasted.<br />Trying to get a fair refund is a hassle.
B004VWKZY4|5|Came as described. Easy Install. Couldn't have expected a bytes product for being after market.
B000NCOKQK|5|This charger is the only way to go if you want to properly maintain your lead-acid or glass-mat batteries.  It is programmed to deliver a constant-current/constant-voltage charge, which will greatly increase the life of your battery.  It will not overcharge the battery.  In fact, you could leave the charger connected indefinitely (although I do not recommend it).  When the battery reaches full capacity, the charger switches to a &#34;float charge&#34; that will maintain the battery at its peak.  It is very simple to use.
B00CI1USXI|5|This product came as listed and was promptly on time and is also a great look on my bike. I recommend that you by this if you are looking for a new look to your stock bike
B00M50MGQO|1|To start off, I would just like to say that I would consider myself pretty knowledgable when it comes to cars, and the maintenance that comes along owning one. I take pride in caring for my vehicles, and doing my best to keep them looking showroom new (asides from the periodic modification work). Before purchasing this cover, I tried my best to keep my car washed, polished, and waxed ever three weeks and under a dust cover inside of my garage for the entirety of its life. I recently purchased this vehicle cover with high hopes, seeing that the feedback and reception of this item was mostly positive. I was in search of a rugged, at least water resistant cover now that I am away from home in the military with no garage to put over my vehicle. Let me be one of the many to tell you, there is no 100% waterproof car cover. Not one that is healthy for your car's aesthetics anyway.<br /><br />Upon reception of my cover, I inspected the components for quality, and any apparent damage that may have incurred during the shipping and handling process. Found none. Picked up the manual, and learned how to install, employ, and stow the cover in the correct manner. Check. Proceeded to install the cover, and employ it. Check. That's when I noticed the first issue with this particular model cover. With my vehicle's specifications, and some help from the seller, I picked this particular model cover according to manufacturer's specs. Well, for whatever reason, this cover was long enough, but just a little short on the sides to cover all of the fairings, and my sideview mirrors did not fit in the mirror cover slots. Like, by a long shot, they didn't fit into the slots. Emailed the seller, told me I was probably installing it incorrectly. Okay.. So I chose to ignore the issue at hand and decided I would test out the cover for the next couple of months before leaving a full-fledged review. A few months have gone by (and I am officially out of the return/refund window), and I have found quite a few number of discrepancies with this particular product. To start off, this item is known to leave a white residue on your vehicle after rain (not sure if damaging or not), the cover is very thin and not at all rugged I already have multiple tears that leak all over, and the most important issue of all, THIS COVER WILL LEAVE A HAZE/SCRATCHES IN YOUR PAINT IF USED IN WINDY CONDITIONS OR FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHERE THERE IS MOISTURE INVOLVED. I have learned my lesson of getting what I paid for, and for not investing in a cover with a long history of safety and reliability.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. employs, and stows in a short amount of time<br />2. Is actually close to 100% waterproof before holes started showing up in the cover<br />3. convenient, as it rolls and stows into your trunk<br />4. pullstring tightening system is handy, however not all that effective<br />5. will keep your vehicle considerably cooler than it will be without the cover<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Leaks when holes inevitably show a couple months down the line with just a few uses<br />2. Leaves a white residue on your vehicle after rain<br />3. When wind is involved, it will scratch the sh*t out of you vehicle<br />4. When moisture is involved, a watery haze will be left on your vehicle. If moisture is present for long periods of time, a haze in the clear coat will occur where a polish will have to be used to remove it.<br />5. Does not have tiedown holes along the bottom for further securing, which also leads to more scratches<br />6. Definitely not made to fit all vehicles obviously, so may not fit the way you want it to depending on your vehicle<br />7. Tears very easily, I've only used my cover for a collective of 10 different occasions, and there are already at least 4 holes in it<br />8. Makes your car look like a Jiffy stovetop foil popcorn bag<br />9. Instructions are in broken English<br />10. Don't know why it comes with a &#34;gift&#34;, but my cover came with chopsticks.
B004J6G3YI|4|I bought these pads to go with a new set of rotors from the same maker. They took a long, long time to bed in, nearly 700 miles. Then they finally stopped squealing and shrieking. They now work flawlessly, and I get the sense they're going to last a long, long time.
B004E5B7YA|3|the bag doesn't work any better than the RZR bag and is almost as expensive as this item doesn't have free shipping as did other items I purchased from Amazon.com
B000A3YRR4|5|Both fit my 96 f250 xlt perfect. Looks so much better now that I have them on instead of mg stock covers, they have been on since 1995. It makes the truck look so much better!
B0075KY0KE|5|Installation was a snap. I'm going to like the multi-folds and not having to have an extra key on my key ring due to the tailgate lock being sufficient.<br />Great product and wonderful service from Amazon!
B0099T1SPE|5|Wanted to replace the ugly green bulb in my center console for my gears and it looks so good and bright with one of these tiny bulbs!!!
B001TZBB3K|5|Best towel for cleaning car windows Period.
B003OTAIWY|4|nice... installed easily..took some time though...so far so good.. actual fitment of center console is a miss.. not the way it should be.. but decent product otherwise.<br /><br />durability unknown as of this time.<br />Materials seem well..sticthed well..<br />95% satisfied.
B009YYVYHG|5|Battery was as easy to install as Prius battery's are.  It fit perfectly!  Had it for a couple of months so far, so good.
B000EDOT8C|4|Very please so far, Does not slip or move when other stuff does!
B00BTYRIAQ|1|I purchased this item and was initially impressed with the quality for the price that was paid.  While trying to install this product, I found out that the quality was very poor.  Material was some type of compressed soft metal that breaks very easy.  After contacting the company, they were very helpful in replacing the initial set because the threading was not proper and the heal/toe levers would not screw in properly.  After receiving the second set, the threading issue was fixed but after several rides I found myself stranded on a busy I95 Hwy (dangerous situation) because the rear shift lever stripped (soft metal) and the toe shifter cracked at the point of the spindle (Soft metal)!  Needless to say, I was not a happy camper!!!  DO NOT PURCHASE!  Very dangerous product!  Definitely not made to proper safety standards!
B00ESBOL3E|4|Amazon is great. Almost everything you need bam it's there. Love buying amazon, However the 50 inch led light is actually 52 inches and doesn't fit my jk so I had to return it. It should state doesn't fit 50 inch applications
B001U60T9U|5|i bought these seat cover for my 2008 honda accord and it fits perfectly looks very nice dosen't look like so cheap cover and goes with the car.
B004ETGQKG|5|works great.
B000VAZKAY|1|I spoke with Bosch tech support and they told me that sensors 15953 15955 15965 15967 have been discontinued. More important fact is that these sensors will not plug into your harness. I have 2001 Nissan Sentra 1.8L Automatic with &#34;no-clean air equipment&#34; not a federal emission or California emissions but &#34;no-clean air equipment&#34; that’s what my parts store told me. I had to order Denso sensors from the local place since Boschs did not fit. Cables have correct lengths, correct attachment points and correct colors on their cable shields but their plugs will not work on 2001 Nissan Sentra 1.8L Automatic with &#34;no-clean air equipment&#34;.<br /><br />On the good note, replacing all 4 sensors is fairly easy if you remove top radiator brackets, remove negative terminal, remove positive terminal from the battery and pull the harness away, remove top hose from the radiator (make sure vehicle is cold and system is not pressurized) about quart of coolant will come out of the radiator and the hose, unplug radiator fans and wiggle out the whole fan assembly slowly - watching out for the snagging wire and hoses while you are pulling it up
B001GJ3ECA|5|I thought it was a useless new tool, but it seems surprisingly well thought out and works really well.It is actually worth it as it makes the job easier and faster. Beats a toothbrush any day...
B005IF36QC|2|Way too quiet for an aftermarket exhaust system. Barely louder than stock system. I don't really see the point of buying it. I'm extremely disappointed that I spent $900 dollars on something and now I have to turn around and spend another $200+ on a resonator delete pipe just so I can hear it. It does look nice though if that's any consolation.
B00AN8NWCM|3|fuel pump came with fuel flow going in wrong direction, with No help from SELLER I found out you had to remove the front cover and reverse it, the pump worked very good.  I sent the SELLER 2 EMAILS for help with NO returns I would not recommend this company to no one.
B00080QHMM|5|I bought this one for myself a year back based on a recommendation from my boss. It worked like charm. Now i ordered another one for my cousin as he liked it very much when he saw it for the first time.
B000C33KZ2|5|Great product.  Good value and easier to get then going to the local auto parts store.
B0032Y91B0|5|Pretty stable and good for sienna
B0002M8TNQ|4|I like the lock-down feature..you have to open the lid to access the lock-down bolts. Paint(powdercoat) is a little thin, as it dings easily and then will rust if you dont touch-up. Lid is not very pry-resistant because of the single locking point.
B0013WJT2E|5|Fit perfect!
B0000AXVBO|3|Seem nice
B008XCF72I|5|great product looks great installed in my husbands truck. everything looks so clear with these lights and truck looks amazing.
B00AQ29FOY|5|great
B00F9RNIPI|3|Cables seem thin for 4 gauge. I have yet to use them, will update when I finally do
B0055DOBDE|4|So far so good, was easy to wire to old system, will know more once I start using it. For the money it was the best deal, less than half the cost of the Manufacturer.
B00486CWEO|5|I have the nose of a bloodhound and cannot stand bad odors, especially in the car!  Very often car scents will be overpowering and then gone, but this lingers and isn't overpowering at all.  It's sweet but clean.  Not at all cloying.  And I love how the lei looks hanging on the mirror.  :)  I only wish Bahama & Co made a turtle with the tropical breeze scent - I love turtles but I'm allergic to vanilla!
B00JM6QEL2|5|I gave it to my husband and he loved it
B000HZFDOG|1|I bought these chains based on the good reviews and am sending them back. They absolutely did not fit my 08 prius, they were not even close. If you have a prius, I'd strongly recommend buying different chains.
B00075XCCG|5|Fit great.  worked Great
B001AZH6H4|5|Very handy, and very sturdy...  I have a lexus and and the car is small...  This is perfect for small cars.
B000Q96BL2|5|worked for a long time  finally wore it out  might have to buy another one soon
B00F4N2754|1|Do not waist your time and money! This is worse that bad quality. I received it today and the return label has already been created.
B00DB8R6KU|5|fit and installed very good!! nice and sturdy feel. well finished
B007MF6UC8|5|It looks exactly like the original, only a tiny bit thinner, but no one else is going to know!!!<br /><br />Recommended.
B002TV7TW0|2|Only lasted a month or two then leaked like crazy and the clear coat peeled off lense...
B00005AXI4|4|This is a good tire gauge. We've had it about a month and so far it works fine -- seals properly and gives consistent, accurate digital readings that are easy to read. It comes in a hard case for protection, too, which is nice.
B000KPGMUW|1|I think you need a simi or large RV for the tray to work.  I also tried it in the rear seat with the same disapointing results.  I tossed it.
B002GP87NE|5|I was very happy with this decal order. The quality looks great, the price was low, and the shipping was fast. I have ordered decals from other vendors on Amazon and literally had it take months to arrive, so I was very happy when this one arrived about 9 days after I ordered it. If you are looking for an awesome batman logo decal this is a great one to get. The size is as described just over 4&#34; long.
B00CAUG7E6|3|Good
B000CITK8S|4|I bought 4 of these tenders.  Three of them have been left unattended on deep cycle trolling batteries and a start battery for the boat.  It took the little tenders about a week to get all of these batteries back to full charge (green light) after a summer of on again off again use.  The fourth is working two motorcycles batteries at home.  What I did there was locate both of them (batteries) near the outlet and tender.  Because of the two connections (alligator clips and loops) that come with the unit you can actually just charge one until the green light comes on then switch the connection to charge the other via the quick disconnect.  It's a very slick way to get more use out of one Battery Tender.  I gave only four stars because the proof will be in the spring when all of these batteries go back into the boat and bikes, but I assume everything will be fine.
B00PIL6XX4|1|Didn't attach to the wheel properly
B000VU91SG|5|Very good fit perfectly into my Ford F150 51/2 foot bed it is a great product.  I just rolled directly into the truck bed with no fuss. Nice and grippy on the bottom and grippy on the top. Nothing slides around any more. Very comfortable to kneel on in the bed.
B00BDEOGA2|5|Bought these to keep boat potable water hose clean and free of debris.  The seem to work fine and like the small holes that let air in and not much else.
B007J8ILES|5|This was trivailly simply to install and made a definate improvement in radio reception in both clarity and signal strength.  Great buy for my music loving daughters' enjoyment.
B000E286VY|5|Filter delivered very quickly, was wasy to install, and exactly as advertised.  I noticed an improvement in throtle response.  Great product, for my Suzuki z250 quad.
B00HNYHTT6|4|They are bright but I wish they were brighter.  Way too expensive.
B0031BN5UC|5|just what we were looking for
B0002UHVAA|5|Product works great. We camp every weekend so our septic system gets a work out. The 45 degree angle is perfect for washing out the tank. Well worth the money to keep your tank clean!
B007O0ODSY|5|Perfect fit, no leaks yet.
B004YID4DY|5|Excellent  look great,
B008E94ZVE|5|Will this fit my 2015 toyota camry?
B000C5HRGS|5|In the last 50 years, I have only had one (1) thermostat fail mechanically after only two (2) years in service.  In the last two (2) years, I have had two (2) of these thermostats leak around the O-ring.  It looks like Ford screwed up the O-ring size or the material.  These thermostats on the 6.0 diesel need to be replaced each year or you risk a leak.
B000C9QAX0|5|Ordered this one to replace the broken tank.With the tank it contains set of gaskets. As i found one of the leak points coused by bad gasket. The tank itseld made just like the original from the factory, same thickness, same form. I just unbend the tabs and bend it back. And it's kinda strong, i drop the radiator after replacement and it didn't leave a scratch.
B00029JXNE|1|Reading not accurate.  400 rpm low.  Tach was not powered to neutral position before needle installed.Looks good but inaccurate reading render it worthless.  Not able to caliblate without destroying outer bezel...
B0002Q801I|5|Haven't used it yet, but it was very easy to install in my 2010 Mazda 5. Only took me about an hour, so a competent person would be done in no time. There is no need to run a wire to the front of the vehicle with this kit. Three wires connect near one tail light, the other wire runs under the trunk trim to the opposite tail light. Once you gain access to the wires, use the little probe to see which wire is the brake, and which is the blinker etc. Identify &#34;left blinker,&#34; for example, and then the instructions say which kit wire should be spliced into the left blinker. Slide one of the little blue connectors around your car's wire, push the end of the kit's wire into the hole and snap it closed. It is pre-filled with some goo to keep water out. I had a little trouble getting them to snap by hand, but no problem with little pliers. The electrical aspect of this job was easier than the task of getting to the wires. I also ordered a Automotive Installer Pry Tool kit for about $5 and it was worth it to help pop the trim panels on this job.
B000I1KJT8|5|Well worth the buy, also great to have in your arsenal of mechanics tool box. Saves you from busted, cramping hands when trying to fit a hose clamp.
B004R36WZ8|5|Great product.  It did take a little while to get it on.. Crosstour is dual exhaust with fire plate underneath.. So had to drill through the fire plate to put in bolts. Not bad with the right tools.
B00AN5JWXI|5|These letters really made the bumper pop They were a perfect fit And very easy to put ongetting Great job
B00L9FSOLC|5|The price is right. fit like a glove and works fine.
B000CK7MWM|5|Do not feel much brake fade at all and seems to be a good match with Raybestos Professional Grade Rotor(s).  Truck stops nicely and that is what I want.
B00B5VEGTY|5|Works perfect with my 2014 ST.<br />Couple thoughts.<br />First, it says it'll take 20-40 minutes to install.  Yeah right!  Took me about 90 minutes and I was prepared with tools out already.  I do not have a lift.  I could have done it alone, but it was easier to have my wife help at times.  Also, a tool box to prop it up in the right position is great, so your arms don't get tired.<br />Second, I didn't have a grinder, just a rotatory tool and I got the job done.  You just have to open up the access hole ever so slight, so even my junky $20 rotatory tool and sander bit did the trick, although I broke 2 in the process.<br />It calls for a 15/32&#34; drill bit...ok who has that?  I have at least 100 drill bits and I don't have a 15/32&#34;.  I went with a 1/2&#34; and it worked just fine, since that's only 4/100ths of an inch bigger.<br /><br />I'm pulling a 260lb harbor freight trailer with 2 kayaks and 2 bikes, and also a hitch rack for 2 bikes and works great for both.  Would recommend and despite it taking much longer than it says, I was actually surprised by ease of installation.<br /><br />Also, will work with aftermarket exhaust.
B001CHG19O|5|Brought this product because i wanted to improve the performance of my Hemi and it did just that. I drive my car hard and this is exactly what i needed to keep her going. Works great and you will notice a difference when you install it. If i ever get a new car i will definitely add it to that car also.
B00C7Y2LBI|5|97 Toyota Corolla<br />Good replacement for the OEM light.  The bulb holder is VERY TIGHT to remove from the unit.  Good construction.
B006HSO6J0|5|Everything fit in my boyfriends camaro perfectly. it looks great and my boyfriend loves it! perfect for any steelers fan.
B005SEJRSE|5|I started using it in a corvette that sits more than it is driven , switched from Mobile 1 , and noticed I had no noise at start up use it in everything now , also got a slight fuel mileage boost
B0099Q66C2|5|Easy to programe with a unique look, just neede to visit the locksmith to cut it same as the existing one
B00KHUQAY8|5|Very easy put on very strong cover I love it
B000CBXSX8|5|Works great; super easy to install and set up.  Only suggestion is to find the place on the garage ceiling that allows the lasers to fire on a spot in each car before you install the bracket to permanently fix the laser to the ceiling.
B00OK42H6M|5|Very Nice.... Not cheap looking.... Nice color-texture-fit
B005H5332A|5|This is a great product. I love the color. Supper bright!!!!! Thanks you guys and gals.
B000EH0ORI|5|This is a must for boaters that have to carry gas cans to the boat.  The only gas cans you can buy today have the safety spout and you will grow old putting 5 gal. of gas in your boat.  This item makes the job very easy and fast
B0012FKICC|3|Bed , bath and Beyond has a similar piece for $10.<br />This is way over price…works well for small space.
B00ASMX23W|5|I Put this battery into my 2006 Honda VTX 1300 two months ago and I must say that so far I am quite happy with it. As it is advertised it was charged and ready to go when I got it. It has held its charge very well even when the bike has sat for a couple weeks.<br />Also, I accidentally left the key on for about an hour as well once and when I came out to it, it fired right up.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this battery, it's a great buy for the price.
B001VJZOBO|5|This unit works very well. Hooks up in minutes and is very accurate. Gives Green, Yellow, and Red indicators so you park in the same spot without hitting wall.
B00M0TLQ6Q|5|received a box full of rust - put the blocks of rust into the Evapo-rust pail - left it overnight - next day I had several tools in the pail.<br /><br />Easy to use - easy clean up and does not have an odor.<br /><br />I would suggest any grease be cleaned off before using the evaporust
B0028SN75M|5|I was doubtful if these really work but they sure do! Nine months later after my new car purchase of not being able to enjoy the ride with the top down I now can. Why I didn't think to look into it on the internet as soon as I got my car is beyond me but glad I did since it is better priced than what the dealership wants to sell it for. Has the mini coded stickers to prove its authenticity and even comes with a travel case when not in use. Can easily hear the radio without the need to raise the volume up a bit and also what the passenger(s) are saying to me. Highly recommend this wind deflector and the seller too.
B00KIZJJQI|5|Fabulous fit.  Made my car look like new.
B000TYTS64|5|just nice
B007HYAUZW|3|Seemed to be a good product. Found out that some of the l.e.d.s wont stay lit. There are 2 led bulbs in each light, sometimes they flicker or sometimes they both wont stay lit or even come on. I bought 16 of them, 4 dont work well.Otherwise they are small and look nice
B000B68V6I|5|Works great.
B004M8L4HY|5|I installed one over the sink in my camper to reduce the battery draw while dry camping. While I haven't had an opportunity to actually time battery life while using these lights, a multimeter confirms the amp draw is considerably less than the incandescent it replaced.  It is at least as bright as the light it replaced, possibly brighter.  The light is very white; if you are looking for warm white, try the 52429WW.  I prefer the color of this light.<br /><br />It comes with everything you need to install, including screws and wire nuts.  I installed this light in about 5 minutes.
B00HWLQQL2|5|I purchased these and used them as rock lights. They are very bright and look awesome.<br /><br />I took the pics with my phone so they're not that great but they give you an idea
B005NLQAHS|4|Works well for me.  I use with android torque to monitor engine sensors and check/clear engine codes on several vehicles.
B00SI6NU3W|2|Liked mats nice quality, but were slightly to big so disappointed because was flagged that would fit my SUV :(
B000C5G3WW|5|Comes w/ 2 pads and will fit abunch of different pedals.  Good quality and tastes great with a little mustard.
B00HLUYR1U|5|I rewired the switch to my RZR's switch and it works great. The shipping was fast and packaged well. The LED's are bright. Strong heavy duty casing, went muding for the weekend and was bounced around a bit, washed, bounced around a bit more and washed again and still looks and works like new.
B0000AX5X5|5|I am, generally speaking, an adherent to the \\"get what you pay for\\" frame of mind.<br /><br />I felt it was a bit of a gamble to buy these goggles, but for the price (I paid $9.99, through Amazon, from Northern Tool) it wasn't much of a gamble.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these goggles.<br /><br />They're not *quite* as good as say, Scott goggles, but they're very close to that in terms of quality.<br /><br />They don't fog up, the lenses are nice and clear, and the ventilation system works well at keeping out dirt/debris.<br /><br />All in all, would highly recommend.
B00FHFRT6G|1|The poorest quality product I have ever received from Amazon!  Possibly this was a return item as the staple holding its storage bag was missing.  One of the two screws was not threaded correctly and I had to buy a replacement.  It took<br />me 1/2 hour with a wire brush to clean off the rust and scale.  Once it was cleaned and repaired it worked;  but if I had seen this poor quality in person,  I would have purchased a better quality product at Harbor Freight.
B0016KH254|5|fit Nissan titan perfect only thing was finding where to mount it
B00062ZVW4|4|Fit into my S2000 perfectly, hopefully will save me some money down the road. Any performance gains are nonexistent to imperceptible, but I knew that going into this purchase. I did notice that some of the plastic/resin spoils left over from the injection molding looked to be trimmed by hand, meaning that there were some liberal and inconsistent removal of plastic in some areas, but these are purely cosmetic and honestly, inside the airbox, I'll never see it.
B004S7V7RG|5|I recently bought a nice car and wanted to use something to seal. I daily drive this car and the optiseal has done a great job. Water beads off perfectly. I also use the ONR polish and they work great together. The optiseal goes on with a simple spray and just blend it in. It will flash off and you are good to go. If you use too much just blend it into a bigger area. I would definately suggest this product.
B000GKU0D6|5|This works well! I needed to grease the center of a mower deck and only something like this can reach. It does, and works well.
B005OK987W|3|My only complaint is the packing.  Rolled into a tiny tube that was hard to open and too much postagel
B0049CNX36|5|Seems very solid and well built.  It fits perfectly in a 2005 Tundra and 2008 Toyota 4Runner.  You'll have a little less than 1/4&#34; play from right to left after it's installed.  To fix any noise that would make, just head down to your local Orange or Blue home improvement store down the plumbing isle and buy 5/8&#34; i.d. (Interior Diameter) O-Rings.  $2 and you'll have plenty left over when they wear out.
B0046DSWI4|5|I love the way it shines in the sun. Crystals are STILL on after multiple car washes and rain and snow. Love this producT. And h appy with the purchase.
B002X58ZWU|5|As stated in others reviews, the sticker is rather big to fit a small BMW M mirror (and leaving any space to actually see anything in the mirror for that matter ;D), but it's a great item nonetheless ;)) It's not the printed type, I received a cutout (= better looks IMO…).
B00G6ML8YI|2|Light will not work with trolling motor mounted straight with centerline of boat, will only work if trolling motor is mounted diagonally across bow. Called rigid, no concern on their part. &#34;Just send it back&#34;. In review this light will not work on 50% of boats .
B000TYSBTO|4|The Honda xtractor tool is mandatory to remove and install bushings. First side took me 2 hours. The next side took 40mins.<br /><br />Removing the old one is easy. Just use penetrating oil and let it soak overnight. It will come out in less than 7 minutes with the tool.<br /><br />Even with the tool the bushing will go in skewed. One side always goes in further. The easiest way to install is to hammer tap it in. Then carefully centre the tool onto the bushing ans drive it in. It will skew as it progresses. Take the tool off and hammer tap the edge that is out the most. Make the bushing line up equally. Put back on the tool carefully and drive again in. Just make sure the bushing goes in equally and true up to the white mark on it. Don't forget to have it clocked properly when the new bushing is placed in the trailing arm!<br /><br />I read some reviewers saying that leaving the new bushing in the freezer overnight helps to get it in. In my experience this did NOT work.<br /><br />Here is the instructable I published for that job.<br />http://www.instructables.com/id/Replacing-trailing-arm-bushings-on-my-honda-civic/
B000ALIRWM|5|Great product for the price!  Fit great works great, no more trunk closing on our fingers and heads.
B000C5I2YO|5|Fits perfectly
B00MUHGZGY|5|Way too cute
B00L35RI5G|3|More than happy with the screen a little thinner than I expected but fits perfectly. Has some defects from manufacturer on it but not than noticeable.
B00746LT4Y|3|Gets the job done, but it's not like the original.  The original twisted into a pair of tabs in the water outlet to hold it in place during installation.  This one doesn't protrude enough to do that.  Thus, I had to rotate it out of the way of the tabs and use a wire looped through the tip and all the way through the outlet to hold it in place while I attached the housing back onto the engine block.  That said, it does work.
B000RFUF12|5|Great. Perfect for golf cart battery maintenance.
B00BVPU4J0|1|Aftermarket - low quality/poor engineering design. Actuator arm was not properly bonded (ultrasonic welded?) to the drive solenoid shaft.  So it arrived loose from the assembly and would not work or stay in place on its own. Designed to fail prematurely! Had to return.
B002DG4FKU|5|the product came very quicklyand it does everything as advertised the lighting is very good ten times better then the stock light that was currently in the car for those that are wondering if the LED dims as some of the newer cars do the answer to that is yes. there is one little issue that I have with the LED how do you mount them.when you remove the current light bulb the default place to put the LED is resting on the lens of the dome itself that to me just isn't well thought out. but like I said the product is great and I would recommend it to anybody.I would just like to add the customer service at kensun definitely seems to be the best that I have encountered in a very long time.I spoke with a gentleman named Joe he helped me out to narrow down the issue that might have reflected on my initial review.
B001FXSZJE|5|Very nice piece of equipment ones installed on my trailer i did feel a bug difference now i don't even feel i am towing a trailer.
B0081SC7O0|5|Good quality switch, perfect fit. Fast shipping too.
B00BG5H7WM|5|Fit beautifully WIsh i could still wear it, someone just stole my bike HA (not funny actually) Seriously though, great buy i reccommend
B0010DLHDA|5|Exact replacement for both sides of 2006 Volvo S60R. Car's steering feels new and tight again.
B0040Z9C32|5|great fit!
B001G77TPK|1|It was too small for my CRV and lower quality then standard automobile small.  Had to buy a new one from an automobile store.
B000JFJLK6|5|Used it few times. Works good. Hope it stays that way. Product appears to be well made. Definitely would recommend it for light to medium load work.
B000CN56KY|5|Bought at a very good price from the USA and whats more they arrived very quickly, can't see they've made that much difference to the way the car feels or drives, but at least they'll last longer, and one less thing to worry about.
B007SGAUJA|5|Fast delivery. Sticker is of good quality and sticks on very easy. Follow the instructions of the back and it only took 30 seconds. It looks really really nice!
B000FW4LLW|5|This was a replacement for the one I've had for years that melted in my car on one of those sporadic 120 degree days.  Does what it's supposed to do, holds my insurance card and registration.
B000E28C7M|4|works well
B000MTI15K|5|Good product.
B000GS1GBS|5|Work indeed! Then again this is not my first use of  these progressives. Helps with weight distribution and the plus us road control as well. Works for me.
B002JB62DW|5|I get more compliments on this bumper sticker/magnet. People actually get out of their cars in drive-throus to approach me and praise the sticker. I wish they were still available. It says SO MUCH with so little. Love It!
B0022UOF8Y|2|My son bought this thinking that it went over his current seat. This is a replacement cover that has to be stapled on underneath. The quality is just OK.
B00AO2CWJQ|5|My lenses are so thick that they are constantly falling down my nose.<br /><br />THESE have been a LIFESAVER! I can go jogging and workout in the gym now without having to constantly push up my glasses thanks to these!
B005G2R1V8|5|I installed this last night in my 2010 VW CC Sport and it went in very smooth.  The directions were easy to follow and were specific for my vehicle.  I have only ran it about 15 miles on my way to work but I noticed a difference right now, the car seemed to have better throttle response and the sound from under the hood was a lot deeper.  Looking forward to taking it on the interstate this afternoon.  It sure was nice removing the plastic intake they put in my car and replacing it with this.  I would definitely recommend and you can't beat the price that amazon sells it for, I've looked.
B0081SK6P2|4|Worked just fine. Met my expectations
B0061SBRP2|5|It took about almost a month to deliver since it's delivered from China but it's worth it ! The quality and style is superb ! Definitely recommend this purchase for anyone looking for quality at a fair price.
B00514BKE0|5|Great service from this vendor. Ordered on Monday and received on Wednesday. Cheapest price I could find for this item. Item fit perfectly and works as advertised.
B005904LMO|5|No problems so far. I've had it for 2 months now. It works like it should. I use it for my 2 chanel home stereo so i could add a amplifier that only has low level inputs. It does a great job.
B005R4LFIU|5|I have these lights . Easy to install. I was just wondering what the size of the little white less was across the middle of the lights
B00AQWO0FS|4|Works fantastic.<br /><br />My truck will blink rapidly when it senses a light missing or out.  When I replaced my blinker lights with these, the truck doesn't see the load across the lamp because LED's bias with so little voltage, so my blinkers now blink very fast (which means I have no &#34;dummy&#34; indication if my blinkers burn out).  If this is a problem for you, don't purchase these to replace blinker lamps.  Otherwise, they are great!
B000KI8EE6|4|3 stars, really, if you are a clay bar kind of guy, like me--- but 4 stars for conveniently packaging a bunch of good car-cleaning stuff together so just maybe you will find the time, once in the spring and then before the snow falls, to make your baby look pretty.<br /><br />Easy for me to talk. I'm retired and detailing my Acura is entertainment instead of a time-sucking chore.<br /><br />Product includes 7 liquids and 4 decent microfiber cloths.<br /><br />Tested on my Wife's ride (not on my car!) Her car is a Forester, red with clear coat. Car looks good if you stand back far enough, but up close there are 12 years of hairline scratches and scuffs.<br /><br />1) Car wash soap. Kudos to the 3M chemists for making the liquid a startling vibrant pink just to entertain us. The soap is fine. Takes some elbow grease with a soft, often-rinsed towel to get the grime off. That is as it should be. Harsh soap could hurt the finish.<br /><br />2) Scratch remover: pretty good; mild abrasive helps buff out very shallow scratches and make scuffs disappear. Instructions say apply in 2 ft square areas. Well, maybe, if your ride is in really bad shape. I just went along scratch by scratch and mar by scuff rubbing away those that would go away. Not miraculous, but helpful. Any stronger and it might have dulled the clear coat.<br /><br />3) Wheel and Tire Cleaner: Here is where you want your strong soap. Instructions say scrub with bristly brush and then blast with water. Verdict: just OK. I have used more effective wheel cleaners. Cleans the tire just fine. Does not shine the tire, but that can't happen with an all-in-one tire and wheel cleaner like this.<br /><br />4) Lens and Hard Plastic Cleaner: Again, just OK. you can notice a little difference in the shine of the plastic covering your headlights. Better to get one of the new, excellent restoration products.<br /><br />5)  Leather and Vinyl Restorer: Call it 3M's version of Armor all/. Not good as a cleaner. To make things shiny it's fine. If you apply it smoothly and generously to vinyl it gives a nice result. And just like Armor all, it will be blotchy if you don't coat evenly. I did not like it so much for leather.<br /><br />6) Quick Wax: This stuff is a spray-on wipe-off product that can go on after you clean the car, or to gently wipe off a thin layer of dust. Super easy. Looks good right away and feels almost as smooth as \\"real\\" wax. It has silicone in it, and some carnauba. Won't last long, but looks good right away. Also use it as lubricant if you ever clay bar your finish, just like Griot's Speed Shine, but less expensive.<br /><br />7) 3M Synthetic Wax Protectant: This is supposed to be the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance of the package. It's a synthetic wax. If you only use 3 of the products in this package, make it the soap, the towels, and this wax. I can't say how good it is compared to a good carnauba wax, but it goes on real easy and buffs up fast. A lot of bang for a little elbow grease buck. I will update on its longevity later after I compare it to Griot's Best of Show Wax on adjoining panels. * * * Update: pretty good! Lasted well and after a month felt as good to mu fingertips as the Griot's liquid wax.<br /><br />In conclusion, I guess that shopping carefully you might duplicate this package for the same price or less, but those matching black bottles do look pretty all lined up on the garage shelf.<br /><br />p.s. Used all these products to detail my Father In Law's white Civic. Looked very good. He was blown away. Honestly, though, that is because he almost never touches the car except to clean the dust and mud off the windshield. Any effort would have been appreciated and made a dramatic difference. The point is, you are more likely to do it if you have all the products together... maybe. AND, I got a bottle of Laphroaig single malt for my efforts. Tastes like campfire ash, but I appreciate the thought.it gives a nice result. And just like Armor all, it will be blotchy if you don't coat evenly. I did not like it so much for leather.    6) Quick Wax: This stuff is a spray-on wipe-off product that can go on after you clean the car, or to gently wipe off a thin layer of dust. Super easy. Looks good right away and feels almost as smooth as \\"real\\" wax. It has silicone in it, and some carnauba. Won't last long, but looks good right away. Also use it as lubricant if you ever clay bar your finish, just like Griot's Speed Shine, but less expensive.    7) 3M Synthetic Wax Protectant: This is supposed to be the pièce de résistance of the package. It's a synthetic wax. If you only use 3 of the products in this package, make it the soap, the towels, and this wax. I can't say how good it is compared to a good carnauba wax, but it goes on real easy and buffs up fast. A lot of bang for a little elbow grease buck. I will update on its longevity later after I compare it to Griot's Best of Show Wax on adjoining panels. * * * Update: pretty good! Lasted well and after a month felt as good to mu fingertips as the Griot's liquid wax.    In conclusion, I guess that shopping carefully you might duplicate this package for the same price or less, but those matching black bottles do look pretty all lined up on the garage shelf.    p.s. Used all these products to detail my Father In Law's white Civic. Looked very good. He was blown away. Honestly, though, that is because he almost never touches the car except to clean the dust and mud off the windshield. Any effort would have been appreciated and made a dramatic difference. The point is, you are more likely to do it if you have all the products together... maybe. AND, I got a bottle of Laphroaig single malt for my efforts. Tastes like campfire ash, but I appreciate the thought.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great, everything fit perfectly and was easy to install.
B00WGSDP42|5|Works fine
B001SR26TC|4|Works great when extending lenght of RhinoFlex sewer hose. Some RV parks require extention of original sewer hose and this works great.
B00FB3MT7S|5|Great quality. Easy instructions
B001QIUGVI|5|I received it and out of the box it works. Simple to understand and operate. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money by diy.
B0086RLT40|5|was exactly what i was looking for
B00JEG964C|4|Does the job.  Would buy again.
B00375JBL4|2|I bought this to clean electronics and it was mediocre at best. I opened my package, read as seen on TV on the label and quickly realized my mistake: this was for all intents and purposes a gimmick. For electronics it advertises getting in the nooks and crannies, but I found it was no replacement for a canister of compressed air and a damp paper towel. I can't speak to how well it cleans door knobs and drawers but I would imagine there are similarly more effective items to use.<br />However, it is not completely useless.
B001KQ5L70|5|Door handle was just like the one I removed and it installed very easy.  Received shipment before the date that was given to me. Price was great so much better then the dealer's price. Would recommend to any one who is in the market for car parts.
B004VR07OC|3|rear brackets doesnt seem to great and instructions are not very clear but i still managed to figure it out in under 2hrs by myself. It also states that the 3rd bracket isnt necessary for my 2014 silverado crew cab but i still put it on anyhow.
B001IA8CWE|2|i was looking for a lift strut for a small project i am working on. this has a force of 45lbs and it far to strong for my little project (i needed a 6lb). It is a quality product but the description should have said how much force it puts out.
B00FPJKO66|1|The visors keep falling down every time I hit a bump in the road until it just wouldn't stay up and this was only a week after I put it in the car.  It also slides over the sun visor from one side to the other!!!
B00BGI6A54|1|The product would be great but the windows kept getting caught on the visors. I also had a problem with wind leaking in while on the highway
B000BREMQ0|5|Bought this for snow and ice. It fits ok to my Mitsubishi Pajero(Montero) 31/10,5/R15. I tried them on the rise about 24-26 degree  (temperature -8°C) with snow and ice(rear tires are quite poor), rise and descent was done without any problem.
B005R4057C|3|It's cheap... I mean you can push on it and it bends in after install.  If you don't do that it looks decent.<br /><br />1/15/16 Update: So after almost one year, the red part of this emblem is pretty much faded to almost nothing. I would not buy this if I were you.  Won't last.
B00K18E3OA|5|Once it had unrolled and I left it to flatten, it fitted into the boot of the car easily. We can safely put messy items in the boot now and can be confident that the carpet will not be spoilt.
B001933OP0|2|Part did not work still waiting on replacement hope next one works waiting for it is no fun so hurry
B007KPVNGI|5|Nice kit, fits perfectly, excellent quality.
B00B7M8DIG|3|thought that it would be 2  but there was just one
B000WJIDVC|5|Good
B000IYAZ6C|5|I purchased these for my 1996 Nissan Maxima. I was hesitant in getting them at first. The dealer had charged $100 per side few years back to replace them. Since my car is so old, I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money. Well, after replacing them, I can't believe I waited so long. The pair took less than 20 minutes to replace. They work great too! I would advice that anyone wanting to attempt this to get a set of mechanics wrench. Sockets might be too shallow for the small sizes.
B00QW5PE76|5|All Ive really done so far is just plug in in and vacuum a little spot on the seats to make sure it was working but Im pretty pleased with how it worked. Havent really fumbled with the extensions too much but theyre pretty straightforward and not cumbersome. If the lifetime is good then this is jackpot imo.
B000A8MIE8|5|Please be aware that these lugnuts are only for the steel wheels not for the factory alloys.<br /><br />I ordered these for my 07 Charger R/T that has factory Chrome Clad Alloy wheels and was disappointed to see that they were substantially smaller than the OEM lugnuts. Upon doing further research I found that the correct replacement is the Gorilla 61148CH. These 91743 lugnuts will only clamp down on less than a half of the wheel seat surface and I fear could potentially even pull through the metal of the factory alloys if left to the tireshop's air impact wrench power. I'm sure they are fine for steel wheels since they are normal size but the alloys have a much larger tapered seat than the steel wheels to spread out the pressure.  The correct ones for factory alloys are [[ASIN:B003DA4NEI Gorilla Automotive 61147CH Chrome Acorn Bulge Lug Nut (14 mm x 1.50 Thread Size)]] or  [[ASIN:B0098Z94DC CHARGER CHALLENGER 300 WHEEL CHROME LUG NUTS ACORN STOCK REPLACEMENT 14X1.5 21MM]]<br /><br />Hoping owners of factory alloys see this and don't make the same mistake I made in ordering these little guys instead of the right ones.
B004LX3AXQ|5|A charger that is perfect for maintaining a vehicle that is used occasionally. It can charge at a trickle or fast enough to restore a car battery overnight. I used the permanent connections so it is a snap to connect or disconnect.
B002SIR91A|5|Hope to never need it, glad I've got it. Very pleased with this shovel. I thought is was AAA, as in &#34;AAA Auto&#34;, but name on shovel is LifefLine. No matter, it's a quality product that breaks down to save space.
B00CFSZSK2|5|Works as described. Plugged right into my 2002 jeep wrangler SE. Much easier than a franken-kit.
B000KL2S9A|5|done its job!
B000WJ64O0|5|This has been one of the best purchases I have made on amazon. It fit perfect on my steering wheel and it's doing really well in the heat of the desert. I absolutely love it!
B00FLVONAQ|5|What I needed.
B0000AYES4|5|Quality was good. The interchangeable ball hitch has been a blessing.  Has allowed me to get the job done regardless what size of ball I needed without alot of searching for the right one!!!!!!
B004H2CYYW|3|I brought this keychain for a BFF of mine because she is a survivor of breast cancer, but the words are sooooo small, that with reading glasses, you still can not make out the words.  I am only satisfied because the words are so touching and worthy to be carried around on ones keys everyday.
B004FP378I|5|I am such a fan of the Resident Evil game. This sticker makes it official and very realistic that I had some people ask me where my company is located and how nice our parking stickers look, LOl! Good buy for a true fan of the game.
B000UK9WRC|5|Great part. Higher quality for a lower price. Great kit. If you n3ed one. Look no further. Buy this one
B003AW1LEE|5|Good
B004W4OQBE|5|perfect fit excellent look!!!
B000CODK7Y|5|Did give me a increase in power.  You cant go wrong when improving air flow.
B003FBV8ZW|4|These work great I use the clear and tinted ones mainly, haven't really had too much use for the yellow ones yet. The foam works great for keeping the wind out of your eyes and still allows for some air circulation so that your eyes don't dry out. I wear contacts and find that wearing goggles causes my contacts to dry out. The only issue I have is that if I wear them for too long such as 4 hour rides I find they dig into the sides of my head a little. Other than that they are worth the money you pay for them. Clear vision out of them and great protection.
B005VO48AI|5|Replaced a broken tail light on my '05 Tundra double cab.  Easy install and works like a champ.  Only tool needed was a screwdriver.
B0031TU8HW|5|i like the stig. the sticker looks good.  my son put them on both his bmw's. he gets a lot of laughs from his friends.
B001LHVOVK|5|I've used it on an '05 Mazda, an '06 Toyota, and a Chrysler minivan (don't know the year), and it worked fine each time. It shows you the codes and lets you clear them, if you like.<br /><br />Looking up the codes on the web is better than using the included book, which, as you can probably imaging, can't be very specific or complete for a product that basically works on every car.
B008Y3R396|4|A little rough on the casting of the bolt holes but a round file took care of that fairly easily - works grea
B003TPFDLY|5|nice spring kit, had just the right amount of springs for my choices. Good price too!
B000BN3A4Y|1|I hate giving bad reviews, but this is really not worth the excessive price!  I Love the Idea, but the materials they used to make these hammers is just Way Sub Par!  The idea is great, and it will definitely be able to save lives once they remanufacture the hammers with better materials. The plastic is like a cheap $.99 toy from china, it is way to light to do any good, an it would be very hard to even break your windows to escape. Although the metal tips are a great idea, they just didn't use enough metal to make the hammer useful. That doesn't mean it is unable to break windows, it would only possibly break the windows because of the metal tips, but the hammer is so light and cheap that it would be hard to break any windows.. But I do not have any windows to test it out, but with better glass technology, it will be harder and harder for these to break any windows..<br /><br />  Now the \\"Razor\\" blade that is supposed to be a seatbelt cutter is way to useless, it is a mini piece of razor blade and it wouldn't cut through a piece of paper,  The piece of paper just bent and would not cut, now once again that doesn't mean that it will not cut a seat belt, I really didn't want to test it out on my seat belts, but there is no way that I would risks the lives of my family and friends with these hammers..<br /><br />  I was Very Dissapointed when I recieved these \\"Life Hammers\\", because for the high price, (which I was fine with paying at first), I believed I would be getting a well made tool that is just a no brainer to keep in my cars.. However when I recieved the hammers and felt them, it is VERY Apparent that this company took their Great Idea, and TRIED TO MAKE AS MUCH PROFIT AS POSSIBLE, EVEN IF IT MEANT GIVING THEIR CUSTOMERS A HORRIBLY INFERIOR PRODUCT, That they themselves probably wouldn't even trust the LIVES  of THEIR FAMILIES WITH..<br /><br />  For the price, they should have been able to put together a gret product that is reliable and that would actually be very capable of doing the things it says it can do! Once again, it is a Great Idea for a product that would no doubt be able to save many lives, but the company would rather have those extra dollars, which is just plain Sad!!!!  You can ignore this and make your purchase, but when you feel them for yourselfs you will be Able to feel the horrible materials that make up these life hammers, very thin cheap plastic..<br /><br />  You are better off carrying a knife in the car that has a built opin seatbelt cutter!!<br /><br />  ( prove me wrong Life Hammer, and make your hammers out of better life saving materials and I Will take this down!!)e very capable of doing the things it says it can do! Once again, it is a Great Idea for a product that would no doubt be able to save many lives, but the company would rather have those extra dollars, which is just plain Sad!!!!

B0041HN1HM|5|this lock is sturdy and inexpensive it will do the job just fine.
B0017OG0E8|5|I've got a 1200 custom with mini apes, windshield and saddle bags. Covers all of it except the front which covers to the bottom of the front axle nut. This isn't an issue for me because the bungee cord holds it there and covers the front fender. Don't expect to get any security out of the lock as it is a cheap luggage lock. I use a disk lock anyway. I only store the bike inside so I'm not sure on the weather proof nature of the cover
B008J52L32|5|Works great on my 2015 Subaru WRX STi
B000COTX66|4|will this fit a 2001 vw jetta?
B00029WT0I|5|I was needing a blind spot mirror because I moved the mirrors on my Jeep Wrangler to the body off the doors and the passenger side was blocked a little bit.  This was perfect to put on there so I could see a lot better than with out it.
B00DC4O5JI|5|Works great with the taller seats in my YJ.
B0057UIIKM|5|Great bar pad, looks awesome and goes with my skullcandy grips! Also like the notch for the vent tube for the gas tank.
B00BITQIU8|4|It's a door handle casing, so nothing exciting about it.  It works just fine.  The only issue is it's hard to match the color of the one I'm buying to the existing ones in my car.  The ones in my car are brown, and the one I ordered I thought was brown but it's more of a lighter tan color.  Since I don't want to buy three more just so they match, I'm going to spray paint them all red.
B004XRI3JG|1|The black plastic filler is so sloppily applied that it obliterates the middle bar in the \\"B.\\"  The key chain I received reads \\"DMW.\\"  You get what you pay for.
B005LLQB56|4|I really like it.  I am always cold, especially at work on the waterfront.  This helps keep the chill off.
B00GSA3BQ6|5|Yes, the cover was expensive but well worth it!  The paint matched PERFECTLY and the workmanship was exceptional.  And talk about FAST delivery - other businesses should take a lesson-learned from these people.  My cover was delivered ahead of the posted delivery date....by FIVE (5) days!  I will highly recommend the product and the selling merchant - you CAN'T go wrong!!
B007GCDM46|5|This battery cost a fraction of what Verizon wanted to charge me for theirs.  It works perfectly.  This is exactly why it pays to use the internet to research things before getting ripped off.
B000BZZWIE|2|Warning, this master cylinder comes with 4 open ports.  My car only uses 2 ports(automatic transmission).  There were no instructions how to block the bottom ports.  The rubber plugs that it came with just pop right off.  The master cylinder off my car looks the same but the bottom ports are not bored out they are plugged with metal.  You cannot contact Centric as they do not work with the final customer.  Now I don't know what to do.
B006X8AVY8|5|this grill fits perfect and looks good
B00AZJYDQI|5|Great tool
B000CNHDVO|5|I went from the 40 series to this and it was amazing. Just enough sound but not enough to annoy you. No cab drone at all and can still have a convo without yelling. Freaking love it! Has low enough soumd at idle but sounds nice and deep when you open her up. Even makes a 6 cyl sound like a big block 8. Reccommend it highly!
B000B5QFE4|5|Excellent Service & Completely Satisfied.
B00388K4MK|4|The mirrored face shield gives the helmet a cool look. Filters out some sun light. I haven't tried it at night time. Would have liked to see installation instructions included. I spent some time on the net learning how to replace the old one. It is simple-once you know how. But, a buyer could easily crack the plastic retainers when trying to pry when they are in the wrong position.
B00A23V5EU|5|this is the exact piece I needed for my 2005 Cadillac Escalade ESV thanks to Amazon my air suspension is A OK
B000CBDKQ8|4|This receiver hitch is great but it initially didn't fit my 2002 RX 300.  I had to make it an inch wider to get the bolt holes line up.  Not a problem for me but some folks might not feel comfortable hammering on their new product.
B004I11DFI|5|The taillight unit  arrived on time and happily looks and works the same as the original equipment unit at a whopping discount from OEM (dealer)  prices.  Good find.  Good job, Depo!
B0031W3G6O|1|Biggest piece of trash I've ever spent my hard earned money on, doesn't even fit properly, i hope everyone reads this before they buy
B001EMBSQI|5|This works just great.  Saves me a lot of time waiting in line at the P.O.  Easy to use, seems accurate, doesn't take up too much space. Good product
B005SEJTUA|5|I love this oil..I have an 06 gmc envoy. I did a full oil change about 2 months ago... and I've driven about 2000 miles so far..for the past two days I've been leaking oil ... it comes to find out I had a hole in my oil filter. The mechanics were amazed that my engine hadn't seized up.. I has one quart left in my engine and the car ran fine... they asked what kind of oil I was using.. When I told them Royal Purple.. they said that sh*t probably saved your engine...
B000CIOYT8|5|item arrived fast and in excellent condition. Installed item using procedure indicated in factory shop manual. No special tools necessary but you would need a dependable puller to do the job.<br /><br />the size of the pulley however was larger that the one originally installed in my 1996 grand caravan with a v6 3.8L engine.<br /><br />I needed to replace the serpentine belt with a longer one<br /><br />Other than that, installation was a little hard but with patience, everything<br />went well
B000CQHZ3C|4|Genuine Warn part.
B00FFGPUAO|5|Great product. Fast shipping. Thanks
B001FNG7BM|4|all new starter at a great price, has a little bit of a high pitched whining noise, but it's been working well... dunno what's going to happen... we'll see, but it's working fine now..  very shiny, all new starter with lifetime warranty for half the price of motorcraft  ....  great deal
B00CJ21U7O|5|This site is awesome
B000GU7J7G|4|fits on my crf250r 2007 works well
B0031ZDU62|4|2000 ford expedition. Replaced all 8 coils and runs like new. Great price and great quality so far a couple months in.
B004B8GTQG|5|Applied it to all the rubber sealants on my 1-year old car. Time will tell if it pays off!
B001IF2BDU|5|They were easy to install with the instructions provided.  I got these for my husband for Fathers Day, I was more excited about them than he was, but after the ease of installing and having them on for a couple of weeks, he really likes them now.  They look great on our truck
B00MOBPGR0|5|It's a very nice detailed sticker!!!
B000EVU8J8|4|Easy to use, nice that the cords can be replaced.  For the $$ you can't beat this light - especially since it's got a tach feature that you can use when doing other tuning.
B001P57SNQ|5|Works great!  My face shield use to fog up quite frequently from my hot breath!  This has completely eliminated that and is still very breathable!
B001B5IYK6|5|Ordered these towels to try to avoid smearing and streaking when drying the car after washing.  These towels were really effective in bringing the shine back after washing. I would recommend to anyone.
B007PV3RDY|5|just what I needed AMAZON is the BEST
B004WHS6OE|5|This container has a conveniently low format, simple to use, made of strong material, and cleans up easily. I recommend it to anyone looking for a handy oil drain container.
B0032ID0D6|4|barely fulfulls function, but DOES do it, needs to fit goggle, not all goggles will take it, battery life few hours, carry extra batteries just in case, I have several of these, have not failed last few years, kept goggles & glasses steam free. As opposed to Smith turbo fan type fan goggles, need to take goggles off to turn on or off, & can't do that with gloves or mittens on. Has on-demand setting to avoid that difficulty.
B00CWXN6V8|4|The Decal looks good, but I have yet to use it.  The Decal is for my vehicle, with additional lettering it will work for my needs.
B000MQOJ6S|1|Did not do the job! Hard to mix. Guess I thought buying this over the internet would make it a better product, I couldn't find it here
B003MA73SM|5|Perfect fit. Great vale, great price.
B00HVO0LVG|2|I'm sure this hammer breaks glass just fine, but it absolutely DOES NOT glow in the dark.  Not at all.  Not even a little bit.  If you specifically want one that glows in the dark so that you can easily find it in an emergency, DO NOT buy this.
B00092RY80|4|A tad pricey, a bit lighter than expected, but all around good product with firm hold on all cable. A sturdy quality termination for custom hi end power cords.
B002JH7PEQ|1|I am not sure why it has 2 outlet spots.  I tried using it to run a small blender and it kept shorting out.  Seems like the only thing it can do is charge a phone, which is pointless.
B000BGHVSM|5|As advertized. Works great! Just what I was looking ffor and could not find locally at two different RV dealers.
B000CNLCHA|3|Make sure and do the research on your year to get the right depth...do google searches on the web and check out their website as well ...otherwise...hey its just a spacer...right.
B00C7Y6AHE|4|They look great on the truck but with most aftermarket parts the screw holes didn't line up the best had ream them out a little and had some form molding tabs on the back side had to break off they hit right at the headlights
B000UVUAFO|1|I tried this product on a minor scratch and it just doesn't work!!! The scratch didn't get any worse but it didn't get any better either... waste of money!
B001EYYRDW|5|Works like originals! they look much smaller but they do the job!<br />thing that was annoying was that the originals had (L)-Left and (R)-Right stamped on the side and these had (A) and (B)... other than that they work :)
B001GFUCD8|1|The only thing that actually worked were the OEM manifold I put these on and just instantly leaked
B00IBIPOAO|5|These worked perfectly for my '97 4-door Blazer! I no longer have to worry about the glass falling on my head anymore.  I highly recommend these as a replacement!
B003GZFEAW|2|The radiator I received had fitment issues.  I have a 1997 M3 Sedan so it should've been a no brainer.  However, when I tried to install the transmission oil cooler the bolt holes didn't line up.  So I figured probably not a big deal since it was a single fitment issue.  Then I tried the fan shroud to make sure it fit.  I didn't expect a problem here but the shroud didn't fit flush to the new radiator.  Ok, so now I have 2 fitment issues.  No big deal, right?  Well, I stopped there cause I didn't want to continue down this path with possibly more unknown fitment issues.  So I returned it.  Looked like a great product but it's not quite a drop-in replacement without significant modifications.  I read some of the reviews that the fitment issues had been minimized or eliminated.  Not the case with the one I received.
B00JGF7HW4|5|They are awesome. I have a black and red 2002 Toyota tacoma 4x4. The slight black in these light make my truck look great. They arrived well packaged and took less than an hour to install. They do not come with bulbs. But you can just use the ones in your stock headlights. And in my case, I had to take the grill off. It's easy, but be prepared to do it.
B000C4087O|5|I wish the socket part was a bit longer, but it definitely makes taking the filter off and putting a new one on so much easier.
B001AWLTX4|5|Very adjustable and will work with people who have big heads like me! The material is decent but is really nothing more than a wind barrier. Great for looks!
B001I35LPM|5|I bought a new truck, and the first thing I did was to buy a new Trifecta cover for it.  I had one on my last truck, and did not hesitate to buy one for the new truck.  It is a super cover, and very easy to operate and to take on and off the truck by myself.  I am a a wood worker and also remodel houses.  I open and close the tonneau cover many times every day and it looks and works as good as it did when it was new.  I also like it because if I need the whole truck bed open, I can removed it a minute, and store it in the rear compartment of my truck.  After I am finished hauling the load, it re installs easily and quickly, and I am on my way.  The cover also seals the truck bed from snow (Minnesota) and rain.  I have not had a drop of water inside of the bed, even in a driving rain.  I HIGHLY recommend this cover for your truck.  You will not be disappointed.
B000NWA8HU|5|Perfect fit in my 03 duramax
B004SRRM48|3|It fits and it works. Maybe it should be 4 stars. it seems to struggle a bit as the window moves. But it fits and it works. I would buy it again.
B00NS6MR0Y|4|good
B00265FXTA|5|This product was ver very very easy to install. part was the same as factory part. will order again if needed
B00AR379U4|5|Carb worked excellent !
B000B6CVZU|5|Great price and good quality. Worked perfectly.
B004GCF1CK|5|Fit perfectly and looks great!
B00522WQYO|5|Perfect fit. That's about all there is to a cupholder. lol Someone threw mine out at a car wash and I wanted a stock one back in; this was it!
B00KB4ZL6I|5|Good size ,good material
B00B8KBNDY|4|Had some problems because didnt have the right tools. I order a molding Trim kit from Amazon and once I had it it didn't take long at all.<br />It is very bright at night which I have a love hate for.<br />I hate it because people can see me in my car from miles away.<br />I love it because if I need to find something in my car at night,its easy.<br /><br />the reason I am not giving 5 stars is it doesnt come with enough bulbs.<br />it only come with 1 bulb under sunvisor but there is enough for everything else. I received 7 bulbs in all but need 8.still happy  with product. Would recommend.
B005LXTOHQ|5|perfect fit!
B003M8S11M|4|Works exactly as expected, no leaks, quality product.  Has been installed for several months now.
B000GV9II8|5|Sounds great, no need for baffles, impressive deep rumbling sound!<br />A bit too tight to install, however got the job done on my own with primitive tools in a bit over 3 hours!!
B001RU31HG|4|I use this product to clean all the Apple devices I have wrapped in invisible-shields. It keeps them clean of finger prints. I bought this small size to take in the car. It. It is relatively expensive but a can lasts a long time.
B001C1ZKCY|5|Easy to use and fits perfect for my Honda pilot 2012. My wife loves it and it is easy to fold/roll and unfold/unroll. Perfect for the hot weather in California, it keeps the vehicle cooler too!
B005N00JB2|5|On time, and exactly as pictured
B0090B7M2O|1|This thing is no good, it tales too long nobody buy this
B006GJMCPU|3|They are ok, i think they are a little over priced and they advertise the 2&#34; lift when its just a 1.5
B001AJ60DQ|5|It's submersible but not waterproof, meaning that water won't corrode or ruin it, (as it will on non-submersible lights as they wont drain properly) but you still have to unplug the connections to your vehicle or you'll get a short. Not a big deal. You have to get out of your truck to losen tie-downs and unhook anyways first, just unplug it. You should always disconnect your connections anyways, even sealed lights can get leaks eventually and you'll get a short.<br /><br />As far as quality and assembly, they were very easy to install. I had my trailer lights swapped in 20 minutes. Much better than paying $100 for a kit at a boat store or trailer shop. I didn't use the side lights or the wiring system yet. This was for a quick fix to get my trailer street legal. Glad I got it.
B0038385H6|3|I bought this because it is suppose to be some kind of super oil. I have not noticed a difference in the way my bike runs over using Harley oil or Mobil One. Doubt if I will buy it again.
B001PJS4LW|5|good price
B009P8ITK6|1|I hated this item because i still had to pay $300 for a replacement key!!! Why sell this if the dealership wont even use it in the first place its useless why sell a useless item that could of been $20 left in my pocket.
B008N8INGE|5|Inexpensive and every winch cable should have a snatch block on it whether you need it all the time or not.  It is not in the way and it eliminates the tendency to do something stupid when you can double the strength of the winch.  Sometimes I use two of these.<br />Superwinch 2000s  on Amazon are inexpensive but do not come with the blocks you get with the larger unit.  YOU NEED ONE OF THESE and the winch instructions advise that you purchase and use them  .
B006QXX1FG|3|It works, but the quality is pretty cheap.  One of the end metal caps came off while I was trying to insert it to the fixture.  I made it to work eventually but the quality is a bit on the low side; however the price for two is quite affordable.
B005ERWJRG|2|Came broken.
B00KHUQ9NK|3|It's okay.. But it reaks alot. I hope it goes away
B00IKJ8QM2|5|Perfect fit for 1997 Nissan Altima GXE.
B00I3Y8M4Q|3|overall good kit only had an issue with one of the fog lights it's not grounding itself out correctly have to attach a ground to the bulb to make it work
B00FB3KZHY|3|Great lights!  Bright as hell!  Looks awesome on my Silver 2010 F150 XLT Supercrew!....so update.  Only been less than a year and one of my lights go out.  Thought it was bulb, so I switched lights, no problem on either side.  Rose like that for a while then same side went out again.  looked at connectors and one of the pins was fried.  Excuse me, there was no metal pin in the positive connection.  Not sure what happened but seems like s*** that it would burn out in less than a year.  (Minimal night driving.)
B001DNH5XI|5|did what I wanted ,great
B003V57NUQ|3|Using them for our 2nd season (which is NY State is 4-5 months) some of the padding is starting to wear off our racks.
B00707B9M4|5|I bought this and the intake from Volant for my Tundra. I love the sound and the whistle it makes. The fit was perfect installation was easy. Nice product I would buy it again. Helps a few points with MPG too
B00BJJZ2QS|1|Good
B00AST8U1E|4|Shipped fast,<br />Easy to install. I do recommend some very, very  fine sand paper to prep the area. Also recommend some rubbing alcohol and rag for prep. The kit comes with little alcohol pads like you use when you get a boo boo, not really good for cleaning a large area. I also recommend a little dab of J.B weld so you don't loose the things the first time you take your vehicle to get washed.
B0093XLGVM|1|these are a joke don't waste your money they came in a cheap bag in the mail. tried both bulbs in my bike and nothing.
B000COTP9Q|5|NGK is a very well known and reliable company.  I use these plugs in my 1976 cb750 and they work great.
B00GA5977Q|5|I love this product!  Motor Trend got it right.  I use it daily to cover the windshield of my 3/4 ton Ram Truck.  It really saves time in the morning before work.  No more scrapping the windshield!!!
B001VZL2LO|4|It works very well, definitely noticeable increase in hp and mpg when selected.  Also is very nice if you need to calibrate your speedometer for oversized tires.
B000BLNTQU|5|A+
B001NH3B5A|5|I bought an 09 Super Glide with stock pipes, and it was just so quiet!  I ordered the V&H Short Shots in black and put them on in about two hours, and it made a huge difference.  First off, these are so much lighter than stock, second, they sound amazing!  And third, they look great, I've gotten a lot of compliments.  The only bad part is you have to make sure to remap your system or else it idles high and runs really lean.  So I've got a FuelPak I'm about to install to help out.
B000I04Z7Q|5|Great colors. 100% worth the extra couple of bucks than just getting a single color. TIP: mount the control close to where you can change it while driving without looking down. Trust me you'll thank me later.
B003D4O9DY|4|i got the exhaust and i put it on my 240sx and its pretty good. after replacing it i started it up and it sounds deeper and not too loud but it will get attention..<br /><br />Pros: its looks a lot better and gives it a nice deep tone<br /><br />Con: it might catch attention...
B007TYLMAW|5|Great fit. Fast install. Good price. 5 mins to pop in, and I don't have a broken taillight any more.
B000C9SH2C|5|tuned up my 2002 Impala and changed the fuel filter and this was the exact fit easily off and on.
B00KQXKG46|5|Never thought it would be this bright.<br />Very easy installation
B00LCD8ISK|4|After shopping around, these mats fit the bill for what we needed -especially the price. Great quality mats.
B0047RV8WG|2|I used these to replace my license plate lights on a Cadillac DeVille.  Much brighter, cleaner look than the stock bulbs.  Seem to be good quality.  All the LEDs work, they fit the sockets well.  Happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Update:<br />After about 3 months one bulb had a couple leds out and was flickering.  I replaced it with one of the leftovers I had form the original purchase and was shocked at how much dimmer the old one was after such as short amount of time.  So I replaced them both.  Within 3 more months another had fallen to leds failing and flickering problems as well as noticeable dimming in both.  (now that I was looking for it) So, after 6 months, all 4 bulbs had failed and I was back to plain bulbs.  Disappointing.
B0036QX4EY|5|time saver for bike work is a must if you plan on doing any kind of work on a bike
B0057NS4J4|5|Great product! Easy to install!
B004DMVIDE|5|Great
B001W6LGGS|2|After installing this on to my Ford F150, I was having great success with properly aligning my hitch to the trailer each time.  Almost all the time the image was clear and alignment was spot on.  A couple of times glare from the sun washed out the image and made the alignment more challenging until I could get into the shadow of the trailer.<br /><br />After the first hard rain the lens appears to have taken on water and the image is completely useless.  After a few days of drying out, the image is nearly as clear as it was in the initial installation.  Once again, the next rain blurred the lens to useless and I am waiting for it to dry out.  I am disappointed to find how unreliable the product was when it rained.  It seems the manufacturer would have accounted for moisture especially when mounting to the outside of a vehicle.
B002R1097O|5|great
B003NU0EM8|3|Will not pull a dent with a crease. Difficult to get suction. slips off
B00D8WHI8O|1|i bought 2 sets of these valves, after a month one of the valves that i gave to a friend as a gift failed and released the air. two month later valve failed on my car. Visibly i could not see any damage to the valves. On both tires the release was rapid. I do not recommend them.
B003PIRSHM|5|This hitch fits neatly, is good value and robustly constructed. With the Euro ball mount it looks professional.<br />Finnish the installation replacing  the pin-clip with a 1/2 in. stainless bolt, lock washer and nut to prevent ball mount<br />tampering and theft.
B00563S1HA|5|Did not work had to spend $100. To get it to work
B00QJWUPC6|5|These lights are much better than that o.e.m that were in my current vehicle. Good product. Hopefully they last a long time. Not as bright as Xeon headlights but would not blind other drivers on the road.
B00080QHMM|5|Have purchased 3 of these.  I like that they are led so you can see them when the lighting is great.
B00397GL5O|5|Excellent product fast delivery
B005NLQAHS|5|Works every time
B003VGQ4RS|5|great price thanks
B00CLMBE5A|5|I was lucky enough to have the person in the parts department of my car's dealership recommend this hitch.  Strong and unobtrusive. Had professionally installed. I'm using to attach a bicycle rack. Fits perfect.  Company shipped promptly.  Would definitely recommend.
B008C0G35Q|5|This is a perfect fit for my Ford F-150.  I purchased only because of frost (don't live in an area where we get snow) It is easy to put on and remove.  I've recently used it 3 mornings in a row with tempatures in the 30's and no frost on my windshield when I remove it.  Would recommend to anyone not wanting to scrape their windshield daily.
B000CITK8S|5|I won't know for sure until next spring but I just put these on my boat and my Jet Ski batteries. Assuming they work they are perfect for my needs. Long cord is very helpful - I didn't need to get an extension cord for either one.
B00NF2KBTU|5|Price was great, works right off the bat, hopefully it will last, but as of now I am pleased.
B007SIF8WC|5|l like the quality of the sticker and have been asked were l got it many times<br />l like the fact it sticks well and will last may years to come
B005FJ0BRI|5|I have an old reader that used to work with my 97 Camry, but it keeps getting errors on my 04 Sienna.  Bought this and it works like a charm.  I like the bright green back light, long cable, and separate read/erase features (my old one will automatically erase after 5 reading cycles).  I was able to find the error code quickly and avoid a trip to the shop.<br />I know it might not work for every car but it does work well with my Toyotas - Just a data point for potential buyers.
B0087NAZM0|5|Best intercom with the new Bell Mag-9 helments. Very clear audio.  Works great with inercom and phones music and bluetooth.
B003S2E4UE|5|Binds well to plastic and can withstand heat + non poisonous!
B0031I207O|4|Fit was ok.
B001LHVOVK|5|I've been going to my mechanic before every annual inspection just to clear out my car system. It's cost me hundreds of dollars but this year I had enough and did some research online. I was so glad I came across a blog article with this device linked and recommended.
B00OTLE1HY|2|After only using the dishes twice there are cuts through the pattern into the plate.  We have only used butter knives against them which seems like normal wear for dishes to me.  They are really cute so I am disappointed they aren't holding up.
B0000YOGXI|3|When you put a low charge to this it doesn't send the 110 V. It sends about 90V and you have a risk to damage the device plugged. when it sends the 110V works great and it's really quiet. it saves the battery very well. In general terms it's a very good product
B00S75VUHC|5|The fuel pump worked great
B00480J4KA|5|This is the same bulb as the original in my 2003 Maxima. It works how it's supposed to.
B0002STSQM|5|I rated this product 5 stars for quality and ease of use. The scale is easy to read and moves easily and stays where it needs to be after reading the depth.
B008AD1FI0|5|Worked great!
B0015DLMOO|5|I am very happy with this. The little funnel end works well to find wind noise and vac leaks also the dreaded belt squeak.
B003YK96YO|5|Arrived quickly, very easy installation. Works fabulously. Allows quick easy access to the truck bed. I would reccommend this to anyone with a truck bed that is too high to step into.
B002TPRNFE|5|I have been using the California Duster for years. Now I have a small one that<br />I can use on my dashboards but also one the plexiglass windows on my Polaris Razor.<br />I should have enough California Duster Life to last my lifetime.
B000C8RADA|5|accurate discription and fast shipping
B000MTSSIK|1|DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IT STOPPED WORKING THE FIRST TIME IT GOT WET, IT IS A LICENSE PLATE HOLDER IT GOES ON THE OUTSIDE OF A VEHICLE IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET WET!!!!
B00OM9KDI4|5|The wife is happy!
B00C8757HO|5|Works great with no leaks.
B006P5BXH8|5|I bought this hat for my Son and he said it was great. just like the picture.<br />color was bright.
B001CS92JO|5|Simple installation. Well built product.
B004C4443E|4|These gloves are good for winter use when it isn't quite cold enough to wear my insulated gloves.  The XXL fit my hands a little snug, so seem to be sized just a touch small (although with all the variations between manufacturers, take this with a grain of salt).<br /><br />The leather is a little thicker than I expected, but it is still thin enough to allow easy movement.<br /><br />Overall a worthy pair of gloves for keeping my hands warm.
B002D7KKW6|5|exact replacement part for '96 Cherokee
B004AJCR30|5|Easy to installl
B00CPKV8JU|5|Finally! The answer to our problems! Being that we have a Yamaha V Star it's hard to find a passanger seat that is made for the bike! My rear end was killing me ! Totally took the fun out of the ride. Then this little baby came in the mail and I can now ride on the back of his bike for as long as we can go!
B00CNYGTDI|5|Works great for polishing metal
B00BITLYFM|5|Great Replacement for a Broken Handle.<br />This was replaced easily in about 10-15 Minutes.
B004RNOW64|1|I loved it while it worked.  I used it to light a wood fire in a fireplace - we live in a mountain home and use our wood-fired secondary heat daily for months at a time.  Reaching between logs to light the little wax starter cube was pretty slick with this lighter - I could build the fire stack around the kindling without having to light the kindling first.  Poking the lighter into wads of paper stuffed in to various nooks and crevices in the firebox during fire-start was easy too.  I especially liked the ability to simply spark it again (or hold the sparker down for continuous mode) when the flame would get snuffed.  The flame adjustment was good too.  But we soon found the weak point.  We nursed it for a week or so before it finally separated and broke for good.  I'm disappointed.
B00AZZV82E|5|received two nozzles two days from order.  Perfect fit, perfect spray pattern.  Just what I needed.  They even followed up with me to make sure it was correct.  Highly recommended.
B001OG68Q4|5|I have only used it one time and that was to recharge my lawn mower battery after it sat in the shed all winter. Attached it first thing in the morning well cleaning up yard debris and mower had enough of a charge by noon to start right up.
B00652XZU4|5|I bought this book for my father and he LOVES it! It's a reproduction of the old-original manual and the photos are even better and sharper. Very thorough and my father is totally enjoying it!
B004TG3R6U|1|I finally got around to installing this. The bottom is about 2\\" above the roof and bolt holes are 1/2\\" off. I enlarged the holes but the bottom has no support and will shake in the wind and probably won't last. I really wish I had gone to a dealer spent the extra money.
B004VDSVG2|5|Snapped on easy and looks great! Haven't had it long enough to say if it will last a long time, but I don't see any reason it shouldn't! Fit perfectly!
B0037VVPFS|5|I have seen the husky and weathertech,these are much better quality.thicker plastic.i did my research and these had great ratings.they fit great and look great as well.you will not be dissapointed.
B000IZ4B7K|5|Excellent price--works smooth & quiet.
B00E8H0VL4|5|Really nice metal frame (not plastic). Looks great on my wife's car. I installed with chrome button caps and is a nice compliment to the overall appearance.
B0051MYLS4|2|After 4 or 5 use start coming apart
B000BO5A3M|2|burst in my car.  get a new can every year or so.<br /><br />seems to work well enough when you get a flat  (id recommend the bigger can though)<br />but just this morning I noticed a very strong ammonia smell coming from teh back of my SUV.  I thought a bottle of windex must have spilled,  but when i got to my destination I noticed the bottom of the fix a flat can had been eaten through and the *entire* bottle leaked all over the back.  I really hope this stuff isnt toxic
B001KOHPOY|4|The bag looks good, like leather even though it is not.  Took it on two trips so far, one trip was 600 miles.  I have a BMW F800ST and the bag attaches to my luggage rack easily and quickly.  I have ridden over 100 mph with the bag attached and no issues.  It does not seem to be as 'heavy duty' as a Kuryakin Gran Tour bag I had for a different bike.  I have expandable hard luggage so I don't plan on having this bag on my bike all the time.  I only plan on using it on longer trips.  It fits the bill for what I need and at a good price.
B001TI5IIQ|3|I used this on two vehicles,  and after it was done... they looked &#34;great&#34; ,  much better and was very impressed.<br />However,  2 weeks later,  it's also returning toward what it did look like before using it.  The &#34;sealing&#34; is a cloth/paper piece and is a one time use item, and I think that's where the key is... and I can't go back and treat and SEAL it again.. as one application, the seal is 'done' and not reusable.  However,  the 'cleaning' portion would do it all probably 2 more times on 2 vehicles, and work fine. That part of it works very very well.
B00498KQIA|5|mirror fit and performs perfect
B00N8NBJPG|5|Fit perfect on my 2012 BMW Z4 28i....looks great matches emblem on center of wheel cover.Locking feature excellent.
B00B0ZMKTS|4|Stows quickly bit watch you fingers.
B001C9KNWI|5|Perfect fit. Great price. Rides like new again. Fast shipping. Thank you.
B001C6Q8M0|5|Great quality and works well for all kinds of projects in the garage.
B0002UQAXY|5|Exelent product
B004K9ETMM|5|Good grips...
B00GLJY712|5|No issue with it at this time. It's better than the default dealership one.
B009HQ7FX8|5|The  RV Designer Collection E525 Fleetwood Style Baggage Door went on with ease and worked as promised by the seller.
B005JU5WI6|5|i haven't had these wipers very long but i really like them. they are very flexible and curve around your windshield and they remove all water off of it. they don't squeak either.
B002PQQFD8|4|I have no complaints. This is what I needed and it arrived pretty quickly and no defects. If I ever have to buy other lights I will definitely look at this company again.<br /><br />Thanks
B003UHH3B4|5|This fit my car pefectly.  Much cheaper than the local oil change place and takes possibly 60 seconds to install including opening the hood and closing it when done.
B009Q5EZBK|4|surprised, good tool
B000MIPR94|4|Fit nice and sounds good. In jeep yj.
B009IPWWA4|5|Perfect. Saved me from buying a battery from the alarm company for $$$$$$.
B003DUFBRQ|3|It's solid and it holds what I need it to.  It handles well on the trail.  The problem is that it attaches using only two wing bolts.  They're hard to get to to tighten.  You have to use a stubby screw dirver for leverage.  Those bolts loosen after about a week of driving so I'm constantly having to check at least once every week or 100 miles.  It adds about an extra foot to the back end of my Jeep with the Jerry can on it which looks a little odd.  I might end up replacing with something else.
B0030I7SW2|2|Shamrocks are too noisy to drive at speeds above 25MPH.  Had to remove them if I wanted to hear myself think.  Otherwise a very cute concept.
B00HW58R92|5|This is a great tool set to work on newer trucks and car door panels, stereo's, dash components, dash panels, etc. I was originally only interested in the tools to work on dash panel removal until I seen this kit that does it all. I haven't used the stereo tools yet, but the tools for dash etc. work great. Makes repairs a breeze. I highly recommend these tools for anyone who works on dashes, panels, stereos, etc. and doesn't want to damage any of the parts.
B004IAB552|5|Didn't come on time, however once it got delivered I was very satisfied. These fit my 2004 Grand Cherokee like a glove.
B000C5DUN2|5|No problems. Working great'
B000CEFT5K|2|this is a really nice decal but i changed my mind after i got it. i was going to put on rear window but its bigger than i thought it was and i ended up putting something else there.
B009FREAGO|2|We don't like this trash bag because it's difficult to open from the front seat.  It's also a little too large for our needs.
B00DBENCZC|5|They look good!!! No problems, easy to install...
B001AZIA42|2|I wished this would work but it would not fit my 2005 Kawasaki Brute Force,So I returned it for credit.
B006B1XUXG|5|I put one of these on my keychain just so I always have it with me, and put another in my backpack.
B000A0CANA|4|Product fits and does the job as advertised. Cheaper than buying at local auto parts store or the dealer.
B000BVP20Q|5|Great seat covers for the price! They did not fit the bucket seats of my VW GTI well, so I gave them to a friend who was admiring them. He is very pleased.
B00AMO6NQE|5|I ordered the white one, I love it! Makes me smile :) Some people don't know what it is by just looking, I personally don't mind that. I also got a free sticker!
B002UD0GIG|4|I read the other reviews and those really helped.<br />Use only on badly scratched devices, not just on one.<br /><br />Because then you will probably make things worse.<br />The lint cloths they give are cheepy, so you probably want to use microfiber if you want to be more delicate.
B00G5OQFFO|1|lasted 5 minutes......seriously
B006ISVBRO|5|Excellent replacement for the stock halogen.  The color is slightly less yellow than the halogen but in my opinion an improvement. The brightness is the same.
B000E3CYJ8|1|the wrong color came - I ordered champaigne and did not expect to get a solid yellow color<br />the stitching came loose on the 2nd time we used it<br />it stretched and did not fit<br />What a waste and a very poor quality product
B00BB0UDLE|5|My boyfriend loves his new Obey lanyard!
B00683YTUA|5|Recieved it quik.. i programmed it myself took a cpl tries but works perfect!
B0024GQ0WK|5|Love the product.  Does what it was designed to do.  The price was great.  I would buy again and I would recommend to all.
B000JZGFLE|4|Went on my '06 4wd f550. No problems with 5k miles on it now, truck weighs 16k lbs everyday. 4 stars because the included mounting studs, witch work, are slightly shorter than factory and don't &#34;engage&#34; as much thread.
B0085IJMYO|4|worked very good
B0015YBYCS|4|Good.
B001N4QY66|4|I used the tachometer on my riding mower, and it seemed to get a good ballpark number that satisfied me.  I would recommend the product due to the price, simplicity of use, and storage bag.  Good stuff so far.
B007GR91BO|5|I needed this for a long time.
B00GH0A7VE|4|I got this on time. Good quality for pice. But I'm not sure if the stearing wheel covor got scratched? But it's okay I'll face it down so I want see it. Matches my mats. Like it a lot.    Update. The stearing wheel covor ripped when I tried to put it on my wheel. :( it ripped in half where the scratch was.. Very disappointed
B000FOIJXQ|1|This stuff did not work as advertised and I am so sorry I ever put it on my Jeep Wrangler fender guards.  The finish after the first application was horrible and it took at least 6 more applications to get a somewhat even consistency and solid black color. After a few weeks it it chipping off in chunks and looks worse than when I started. I do not recommend and intend to contact Amazon about a refund.  BTW all instructions were followed to the letter including the initial cleaning instructions for the use of the cleaning product included.
B000ET9SB4|4|Delivery was fast. Product received was as described.
B005JU5UEW|5|I did a lot of research on which wiper blades were truly the best.  Every where I looked, 'Bosch Icon' appeared over and over.<br />I replaced my Rain-X Latitude blades with the Bosch's and while the Latitudes were quite good blades, I found the Icon's to be superior.  If you're willing to put up a few extra bucks for some high quality blades, you will not be disappointed with these.  I have recommended these blades to all of my friends and they've all thanked me after they installed their own.
B00E1SJYG8|5|Replaced the warn OE front rotors and pads on my Corolla about 20k miles ago with a set from that Irish auto parts store a couple towns over.  Bad choice.  They were warped within 5k miles, and faded something fierce from day one.  Finally, the pads wore out and the wife irreparably scored the rotor on the driver's side, so I purchased this set from Callahan.  This is the 3rd car I've put their products on and continue to be pleased.  High quality product for a very reasonable price, and speedy shipping to boot!  Smooth, quiet braking; on par with, if not better than OE.
B008VPZBJ6|5|Used this pump for a NP-242J transfer case in a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Limited. Fit like a charm. No complaints 1 month in to the install.
B00O9H0QIG|5|Correct product at good price with fast delivery and they work well...
B0031HUFTK|5|This is very hard to find in this pipe size and I needed it for my RV generator.  This one was just what the doctor ordered!
B000HB2CP8|1|not even close, who suggested this color from sem?
B000BUU5Z4|4|Replaced my old style toothbrush holder .So much better
B0033YTV78|5|If you like to ride in the colder months this is a must have.Not only do they keep your hands warm and toasty they keep you much safer due to your hands not turning numb while riding.I also bought the thumb warmer and it combined with the heated grips are a great way to keep hands warm.The only problem i have found with this product is keeping your friends off your bike to warm their hands.
B0013JVZ7O|4|This is a great gauge to keep around, especially if you autocross or go to the track and need to maintain accurate tire pressure.<br /><br />The face is pretty big with a 1-7/8\\" inch glass view. Pressure reading is maintained after removing gauge from tire.<br /><br />The pressure relief button allows you to lower pressure without removing the gauge. The button can also slowly let tire pressure out too if you press lightly. This makes it a bit easier to get to the right psi without having to remove the gauge or tilt the stem to relief pressure. Makes adjusting quick.<br /><br />As far as accuracy, I did not compare the gauge to another gauge so I can't tell. Even if I compared this gauge to another gauge it won't really provide much information in regards to accuracy since the other gauge would have to be calibrated or compared to a third gauge (experimental methods). Most likely it'll fall within the same bell curve so I'm going to say it seems like it works just fine to me.<br /><br />Update:<br />I was quite surprised to find this product a few dollars cheaper at home improvement store but oh well! Tried posting up price but I guess it didn't pass the filter
B004U8JH84|5|Great oil.  Always used in my Hayabusa.
B00FEH2C14|5|Great fit..sexy...
B002N30SSQ|5|These roof racks are great and less than half the price of buying directly from Kia.  We have a 2009 Kia Sorrento and these fit fine on it.  Assembly / installation was relatively easy (the instructions are very bare-bones, but are followable), and we have been using the cross bars for about 3 weeks now to haul kayaks around.  No complaints at all.
B005WRABPU|5|Could not beat that price. installed and work fine. code on odb2 did not repeat and this items fixed it.
B00480N0GE|1|It's a good price but went dead after 6 months of use. I had forgotten which side I had changed when my passenger side went out, after I got the bulb out it was the Philips. Very short life.
B009IK94FA|4|works as it should. Seems to be constructed well.
B003X9TLUK|5|Great price! It was just like the original! I hope it is better than the original... No problems so far!
B005F9K3LW|5|Just as discribed thanks
B000VHK30Y|5|Let me say first that it came faster than I thought possible as I only took the free shipping option and received it in 2 days. Ive only had the product on for a few hours but I can really feel how its keep my shoulder intact without immobilizing my shoulder and keeping from work. I realize that one day Ill have the surgery but I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this product.
B00BGAHFPQ|5|Quick shipping and everything was correct
B00429NKWK|5|Works as advertised; comes with more product than you need -- could probably have done two cars. Lots cheaper than replacing headlight lenses or paying a repair technician.
B000779T3U|4|I love having this! I've used this on several long trips now and cant tell you how much it helps to free up all the leg room in the van. Keep a couple things in mind:<br /><br />1. This is heavy. A strong man can put it in place and take it off, but most of the time it takes two to get the holes lined up and the hitch lock in.<br /><br />2. Folding up is way worth it! Every time I went to a park for a tournament I dropped off my load and then someone would need something from a store. The ability to fold this up makes this hitch stand out.<br /><br />3. You'll need some heavy duty tools to put this together. Some of the bolts have to be tightened to a certain torque. I took it to my mechanic who put it together for me. I recommend you consider that unless you have a torque wrench.<br /><br />I think this is a great value and am very satisfied with the product.
B004CSZXTE|4|It's a starter. What can one really say. It looks like a quality product, just like the OEM one, but new.
B000C1ZL4C|5|works well.
B001GAVGX8|5|Nice for  heating  my cold breaths in 30F° and  below. The cheeks  come up a little  high on my face (I wear  glasses ).
B0001XPC7C|3|was hoping it would have been a bit more solid but it came just as described, i do love when something it described as new and its actually new when i get it THANK YOU :)
B00EVY344K|5|Works just as well as any other professional one iIve used.
B0041PM1SY|1|The one star rating is not because the quality of product. So far, Techmount is the only decent motorcycle mounting system I found. But the picture is showing a mount without pivot which does not match the part number and price. Most shopper probably will miss it if they don't cross reference. As a matter of fact, it's not even a handle bar mount! Not cool, as an online shopper, we rely heavily on product picture and description. If you can't even post the right picture to match your product, how can you be a trusted vendor?
B00CMWDRHM|2|these units could not be programmed by the local tire shop so I had to return them to the sender.
B002A2L5K0|1|Quality is low...
B007REFW32|5|This is an adorable Snow White decal that looks prefect on my mac. I need to order more because they look awesome in your computer.
B007V1Y5S4|5|This was easy to install on a 2003 honda element.  Once installed the fan started working perfectly on all speeds.
B000C3ZDBG|5|Great shock.  A bit on the HD side so any real offroaders this is good stuff for the $.  Recommended by my mechanic bud (got for $44 each), bought 'em, put 'em on, and the ride is controlled and solid.  A bit on the stiff side for my uses, but that offroad capability is definitely there.
B000BQYH6Q|5|Great Tool for keeping in you car!!!
B00L4NHW7Q|5|look nice, didn't smell horrible and look great in the car.
B002KQ86EY|5|I purchased one set and installed them, fit great and helped keep my chains in place and reduces the chain noise.
B002RSIK4G|5|Sealed up the leak in the rv's roof,  worked great, was easy to install.  would recommend this product.  Great Product
B0064TG10Y|5|Cute!
B0051OONO4|5|Great quality. They look great on my vest!
B0095IDUK0|5|Fit perfectly
B0036L66I0|5|For an auto emblem it is clear, concise and beautiful. Clearly identifiable when approaching vehicle. It meets all of my expectations
B006QHENYU|1|Installed the 750051 & 750050 on my 2004 Lexus GX470.<br /><br />Layed a straight edge on the mating surface and found it was not true.  A quick trip the machine shop and it's all good. Installed manifold only to have three of the four cylinders leak around the welds.<br /><br />Amazon was fantastic and sent a replacement ASAP. Had the Muffler shop inspect the the new replacement manifold before installation. Holes found in the welds.<br /><br />Not sure who is working QA over at Pacesetter Performance but they are obviously asleep at the wheel.<br /><br />Definitely NOT recommend.
B000CMDA1C|5|very fast delivery, great value
B00KTIGSTK|4|They work great!!
B000IYSKZU|4|Fit perfectly
B00HIHNX0W|3|Love the led light.
B00KY0DM56|5|This fit my 1992 F150 with 300 CID Six Cylinder Perfectly.  A really good deal.
B00F676B0U|5|fit Saturn outlook
B0007VM3D4|5|Perfect
B008VQ6E64|5|very good
B002N4MAZO|5|I bought this item when it was promotion.  It's fit in my car. Very easily replaced and works smooth when raining.
B00ONBU8TK|5|Works as it should and fits
B000HAEOFU|5|worked perfect as described. would buy again.
B00SBZRR8O|5|It is exactly what I wanted and needed. Great product. GREAT product..
B000BK8PPQ|5|I used to have the floor of my SUV littered with toys, books, car products.  Now I'm able to keep everything organized in the trunk.  I keep my box and papers for my remote start there as well as baby wipes, bottle warmer, books, baby sling.  It's very convenient and helps keep me from cluttering my new SUV.  It was very easy to install and has held up great.
B00B5KYS02|4|The color was a good match, and the end result was very creditable, with no folds, wrinkles, etc. However, the installation of the new fabric wasn't really as simple as it was presented. First, the plastic is pretty brittle, so you run the risk of destroying the console top if you're not careful. Second, the staples came wrapped in scotch tape, which was a pain in the a**. The process wasn't that hard, but you take the risk that you won't be able to get it back together, and you definitely need the right tools.
B007KTINWQ|5|This was recommended by our new car dealer to use to keep it looking new.  It sure does what he said and it claims.
B000W3TFTW|5|Haven't installed these magnetic plugs yet. But I can honestly say from holding them and looking at them, that they are of very high quality. But then most of the Skunk2 parts are so I had confidence in the purchase before hand.  If your on the fence about these then don't hesitate. I don't think you will find any out there built better than these? Plus these come as a set!  What more do you want!?
B00EB3H4RY|5|Fits my Nissan Versa Note perfectly! I live in sunny Florida and definitely recommend this sunshade.
B00498WKF2|5|Can't go wrong with Moog, great product over oem.
B000E2F1WG|5|Best oil for an air cooled engine!!
B002ML8D7C|5|Perfect!
B005PZMLDY|4|Be careful with these. They tear easily on the seam  and straps if you are pulling them tight so be gentle. These fit my 2012 ford escape. My only complaint is I can't figure out how to get the middle seat belt through  (you have to cut your own holes in the cover, which is actually a good idea because cars can have different sized seat belt holes) no one can use the middle belt.
B005CLNWGQ|2|I was hoping to replace my Passenger door handle and was so pleased with this handle I ordered…up until i went to install it and it was the DRIVERS SIDE door handle. Why would they send me the opposite door handle? WHO KNOWS but it isn't worth the time or money for returns. Next time, I'm go to a local store to see what I'm really buying first.
B00FJF0O2K|5|Although I didn't have a drill that could provide the minimum rpm the wheel performed as advertised, just took a little longer. I was concerned about the paint at first but doesn't appear to be affected. Great product and arrived in 4 days as promised, thank you.
B0002SR4Q8|3|It works really well to unscrew your old oil filter, and it's universal, so you'll probably never need any other tool than this one.  But there is one BIG downside.  There's no catch for the socket wrench meaning that if you put your socket driver into the hole where it's supposed to go, the tool doesn't stay attached to the wrench - it just falls right off!  I almost lost this tool inside the engine bay of my 4Runner by accident because of this.  Fortunately, gravity worked for me as much as it worked against me, and the tool fell all the way down to the skid plate where I could grab it from beneath.<br /><br />Otherwise, this thing is genius!  But that one flaw knocks two stars off the perfect rating.
B000CPHXQ2|5|I ordered these and they shipped the day I ordered them. They shipped from Kansas City and got to me in Omaha the next day. Very fast shipping. I'm very impressed.<br /><br />They are good quality flaps. I purchased 2 and installed them on my 05 WRX. They came with 4 screws each, so I had to go out and buy a couple more to secure them properly. (for specific hardware necessary, google DIY mudflaps)<br /><br />They are durable and tough and look like they can take a beating. I'm going to put them to the test this winter.<br /><br />Install was easy and they look great. I'm very pleased. They don't have the durability and overall quality of Rally Armor flaps, but they're a fraction of the price and look just as good in my opinion. I recommend these to anyone looking for reasonably priced protection or the rally-race look on their vehicle.
B00IGCTEME|5|The blower motor went out on my 2005 Tacoma. It was making a whining noise and then finally just quit on me. I like to do things myself, so I looked for a new blower motor and found this genuine oem part from Toyota. It was a easy to install. Installed it under the glove compartment, plugged it in, started my truck and BLAMO! It worked perfectly. I looks like they replaced the original plastic bearing with a more substantial metal bearing. Hope it lasts. For now it works like a charm. So think about it: have the stealership charge you for the part and labor (around $1300!) or do it yourself for a little over $100 bucks. There are tons of forums and youtube videos to guide you through it.
B0056A35FG|5|These chaps fit perfectly!!  Took me awhile to find a pair to fit correctly.  Have a 21&#34; thigh and these fit perfectly!!  Great quality hardware and stitching and are insulated.  Almost had to get the extra tall option...because, I am!!!  No need to trim anything off.  Definitely recommend!
B005VFWOOE|5|Zombies repel from the tainted area where they have already been.<br /><br />it looks like every thing i own has a high five from the living dead
B0039T0518|5|I don't know how to put it on my camp trailer yet but am excited to get the solar panel and all that goes with it hooked up. Thanks
B00BLZAXW8|2|Yes, they look exactly as pictured, but they go on the OUTSIDE of a window so anybody walking by can take them.
B001DCF6GM|1|These shocks did not last 4 weeks.  The lid now opens all the way to the back window.  The shocks are blown.  Don't waste your money, buy factory shocks.  Will cost a little more but worth it.  You get what you pay for is the lesson here.
B0081S9E1O|5|You can't beat the price (OEM is 3 times the cost).  It's plug and play.  I had an issue with my advance curve in the OEM (original) module and this one cured the issue in about 2 minutes, the time it took to instal it.  Just be sure to pack the connector with di-electric grease before connecting to insure no moisture gets in to corrode the connections.<br /><br />My Foreman400 is a happy quad again and I'm a happy owner.
B005O023CO|5|This is a great product.
B0059J51F6|5|Excellent product, well built and function as designed.  Used the set to strap down my C5 corvette on a trailer and they provided perfect tension with no worries of straps breaking.
B000NKXRDO|1|doesn't fit my 2003 e46 330 convertible.
B005ZY94FS|1|Product looks gorgeous like a factory light but mine won't adjust up or down using the adjustment screw. The screw spins freely so I had to put my old fogged up lamp back in my car.  Without the adjustment the beam lights up all the signs and signal heads in town.
B009XIUFBE|4|As with all clymer manuals I've seen,it looks to be very well written and complete.
B003NTQCA2|4|I clean up old stereo equipment and generally use DeOxit products to clean & lub pots, sliders, and switches. On one of the stereo forums I frequent, one user said he used this product for the same purposes and was happy with it, as well as it being less expensive than the DeOxit equivalent. So I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It works, but differently than DeOxit. This product, while it cuts thru oxidation, dries quickly so I'm not sure how well it cleans in the hard to reach locations. I've had to reapply it a few times after checking the results (eg, scratchy volume after application to the volume pot) before I felt it had sufficiently cleaned the item. With DeOxit, it stays &#34;wet&#34; longer and you work the pot/slider thru its run multiple times to allow the cleaner to fully coat the surfaces to deoxidize (is that a word?).<br /><br />And speaking of hard to reach places: this doesn't come with a tube to attach to the nozzle to allow access to those places. I had to scrounge up my own.<br /><br />The is primarily a contact cleaner geared toward auto applications and in that I think it would be great. I will use it for my trailer light connections as well as other electrical connects around the car, particularly under the hood. It would probably work well for household electrical connections also.<br />But as for stereo equipment (or similar apps) pay the extra bucks and buy a cleaner/lub design for that purpose.
B006ULI1QI|5|Sooo happy with this!
B001P4ZJBA|5|This is exactly what you purchase to get you by when you have been spoiled by ones that cost more because they transmit further.
B001CL7Y6E|1|I received this for a Christmas present and the second you open the box this horrible smell is so overwhelming it takes your breath away.  The smell is an oily, chemically smell.<br />So I figured I would leave it opened in my basement for a little while and maybe the smell will wear off..well it has been 6 months and it still smells horrible.  It smells so bad that I eventually threw it outside hoping the weather would help - NOPE.  It is a lost cause.<br />Because it came from Overseas it isn't worth sending back.<br />Beware!
B000I66JEM|5|Works like a charm. Perfect when surfing!<br />Highly recommend. I really like choosing my own combo too! And it's easy to change at will.
B00DR1Q40E|5|It is what it is. Not too big not too small. Recommend it. Green day fans must get. Good to put on almost anything.
B00MWBO6GO|5|Love it
B000S2ST4Y|5|Great product !!!
B0089GTC92|4|I really like these and will buy more for other vehicles
B003066NJ8|4|To start out I'd have to say that the lights arrived faster than I expected, in great shape, and looking extremely sharp. The instructions although were very vague and general in nature so you'll pretty much have to figure it out by yourself outside of knowing the positives and negatives for the halo lights themselves. The term plug and play does somewhat apply to the lights but take it lightly, you're looking around at least an hour minimum to install negating all the hubbub of the wiring harnesses. They fit well once put back it, just use a little finesse so that you can get the anchors back into their sockets, and make sure to tuck away the excess wiring from the added halo/led wiring. There's no instructions either for leveling out the lights or projector lens but if you're a halfway intelligent individual I'm sure you can figure it out. Only had time today to get one properly wired up but it looks snazzy, and I'm pleased with it for now. In the future considering going with a HID conversion, but as for now if you've got any questions about these just comment and i'll see if i can help you out along with showing you pics of them in action.
B00EJRF9T2|3|the rails are fine but they didn't fit my vehicle, guess i measured wrong or something so am giving them 3 stars on this account.  if they fit would give them 5
B000SOKE5E|5|This little filter is amazing!  I used it to filter a 55 gallon drum full of kerosene that had been left out in the rain for several weeks.  If you follow the instructions and filter slowly, it really works.<br /><br />I was able to remove several pints of water (along with some debris) from the kerosene in that drum, and as a result, was able to save it from being wasted.  When pumped into our oil tank and used by our furnace, it burned great - no water!<br /><br />This would be great in any situation where you need to remove water from fuel.  It filters much quicker than expected, and does a great job of making otherwise ruined fuel usable again.
B0013ERRT4|1|Product picture is totally deceiving. Product is only 12\\" wide - NOT as shown. No actual product dimensions are shown in the description. STAY AWAY.
B004AGTQZK|4|Husband likes them.
B000QSZPV0|5|I am happy with my purchase. The amount I bought helped me learn to bleed the hydraulic line. Got the item before the brakes arrived.
B00167S67A|5|I've used it already on my n ext door neighbors car,he didn't have triple A.It worked great after my initial charge
B002LOP5IA|3|no big deal
B00KWGOFCG|1|Didn't work with any of my GM cars/trucks. Although, it did work on my Honda.
B00GMTWDW6|5|Best scent even better I dont have to use the spray bottle would recommend anyone to use this product beats choking on the spray or gettin on your cloths an vinyl is a strong great scent....
B000C7VYVU|5|I received when I was supposed to and it fit correctly.  Good quality and craftsmanship.  If you are in need of this product, this one is a keeper.
B000RHSNQE|5|Works like it is supposed to.
B007Y2SIGK|5|Installation  was a snap. Works well.
B0046I9FSU|5|Works great, easy to program. Glad i bought it instead of having put in a key to unlock my doors and having scratches by the lock.
B00495UQT2|5|Fits Perfect
B000JFL8RU|5|The service couplers it comes with are the 18191A high side & the 18190A low side. I was not sure what service couplers where supplied with the Gauge Set, so I ordered a 18191A high side & a 18190A low side. Spares for when the supplied ones wear out I guess. They want about $133.30 for this set on sale, from local vendors in my area. So I paid the same & got the most likely to wear out parts to boot. Used free super saver shipping 24 July 2008
B000E4VC7W|4|Mirror was packaged well in box over box. Finished well... no big mold lines and color was uniform. Had to push hard to get it to fit in bolt holes but once in the manual adjust worked fine. Overall good finish ...OK fit... good price and fast Amazon free shipping!
B004YJ0RXS|5|Pretty straight forward, they work or they don't.  Got the lift I wanted, truck sits level with a 2&#34; coil spacer in the back.<br /><br />NOTE: I installed these on a 2001 Navigator and they worked just great.
B00E7VFL8E|5|I ordered these and the rear cupholder plate, and was very surprised at the quality of them. They are nice high quality cut acrylic and fit perfectly in the door pulls. It does come with a set of four which was nice but the tape it came with was not so nice. It was double sided foam tape a little on the thick side and due to the design of the Dart's door pull design being very curveacous deisgn the tape made it a little hard to apply evenly. I had some left over 3M thin tape strips and used those and it sat very flush and looks very nice in contrast to the silver door handles. I would definitely order again from this company based on how high quality their products are and the very good fitment, the only thing I would change is the supplied tape, like I said if you have it 3M thin tape makes it alot better.
B00GI77ONA|1|I needed to return wrong light for me
B001EOV474|5|Easy to install. The bracket is cheap..flimsy.  Was fortunate I had the means to make a stronger bracelet at work out of 3/16 steel.
B001BN76KC|5|The MSD Enhancer is a great product. I have been running them for years now in my Superjets and have never seen them priced this well. Best bang for your buck mod available today.
B00CMGBEZU|5|Good delivery, i got the last coated one i guess, awesome lol
B004UOE8XC|4|Good product, but plastic covers could be a little more sturdy
B002X7VH1Y|5|Very nice polish. Cleans beautifully and the shine really is glossy. Did a beautiful job on the black granite with no smearing when I ran my fingers over it. Surface more resistant to water marks. I bought this product and Granite Gold cleaner to test them side by side, and the Gel-Gloss left a much better finish.
B001G75R68|5|After watching this DVD i feel i could strip and rebuild my Triumph myself. i like his style and the camera work is great. Not cheap but i feel well worth  the money.
B005M1SR0W|4|Assembly is difficult, had to bring it to local (non BMW) mechanic, but cost of part and labor amounted to about half of what it would have cost at BMW dealership.
B000C9OLPY|5|Good
B000EW0KHW|5|If you have a car or truck within the years recommended for this unit, it's a must. Makes things easy to check an locate problems. Why pay a dealer 125.00 to check a code,when for 25.00 you can check it yourself an put the money towards the parts needed. Make sure you get the cable, pricey but worth it.  Tested a 1992 Ford F-150 4.9/6 2WD
B0068SW90W|5|We bought a Harley at an auto auction and it needed some work so we have been putting new parts on it here and there.  These pegs look great and were fairly easy to install.  My husband loves the grip they have.  No slipping when shifting.  Great product!
B004ZF38G4|5|I am very happy with these h.I.d. headlights and the customer service with kensun. They have went beyond what I would have ever thought to help me out. If your in the market for h.I.d headlights, I recommend this company. 6k h.I.d lights are very bright love them.
B004139PSU|5|Looks great!<br /><br />The installation is easy, with a little patients.<br /><br />One improvement would be Color Instructions.<br /><br />The &#34;x&#34; Logo i got was Grey/silver, not Red.
B00IU89MBW|1|I really Love it! It makes the long rides so much more comfortable. I am not sure why we waiting so long to get one.
B000CQBND0|5|Built for duty squared away
B00THRJZSK|5|Great quality for the price. Slightly large for the truck but that is alright. Arrived on time and in good condition. I may buy a smaller one for my wife's car. I highly recommend if you are in the market for a good car cover at a reasonable price and good quality.
B007AOQTQS|4|Fit perfectly and the grey color matched my 2013 camry hybrid interior.  I only deducted one star because the gas/trunk levers are covered by the mats, which would not be bothersome except that the sharp plastic prongs on the undersides of the mat can be uncomfortable when lifting the mat to pull the levers.  This part of the mat could of course be cut out as indicated by the manufacturer.
B0002U6RWI|5|what else is there to say!  great bumper sticker with funny message. only problem is that adhesive didn't last very long and it fell off my bumper.
B00336YWS4|4|Shipped quickly, fit my 2006 CRV as advertised, installation was quick and relatively straight forward despite a lack of detail in the instructions. The spacing between the bars is not the same as OEM as the roof cargo box that is supposed to fit on stock rack did not fit without an adapter, but I have used the cargo box with about 100 lbs on the rack 3 times for 2 hr trip each way on highway with no issues.
B000MK5LVG|5|nice
B002BBDJB8|5|I was having issues with the cooling fan on my 2004 Liberty for about 2 days. At first the A/C wouldn't cool while idling, then after a bit of driving around, the coolant reservoir tank was bubbling over with coolant spewing out of it.  Also, the temp gauge was nearly redlining which never has happened before.  After a bit of DIY process of elimination, I reluctantly, and with some reservation, ordered this fan on a Friday around noon with Saturday delivery (at a steep delivery charge). I wasn't totally convinced the fan was the problem, but at this price point, it was worth a shot.  To my pleasant surprise, I received it Saturday afternoon, and I was rolling in my Liberty in less than 15 minutes. Bonus is that I still paid $50-75 less than the cheapest price I found at local brick and mortar stores, even with Saturday delivery.  So far the fan is working like a champ, A/C is ice cold and the temp gauge never crosses halfway.  With the old fan, there was some lag time before the fan kicked in when the A/C was turned on, not so with this one.  The fan turns on immediately once the A/C is activated.  Also, if the temp gauge creeps past halfway, this cooling fan turns on where as the original fan took some coaxing (specifically the Fonz technique), which was one clue that maybe it was the cooling fan and not any relays or connections.  FYI, be certain which type of connector (three or two prong) the original fan has.  There is another fan that is listed as fitting the Liberty, but it has a two pronged connector.  I almost ordered that one because it was a bit cheaper.  This fan has three prongs (pictured in the images) which matches the original fan.  Just like previous reviewers, I can't vouch for the longevity of the part since I've only had it since 6/8/13, but so far so good.  It's holding up in Atlanta rush hour traffic, in the middle of summer, so that's some bit of reassurance.  And for the record, I am very grateful for the Saturday delivery option and will nothesitate to use it again if the situation calls for it.  I'm usually pretty stingy when it comes to extra delivery costs, but after factoring the cost of renting car for the following week, Saturday delivery proved rather beneficial.  UPDATE 3/17/17  Fan lasted less than 4 yrs until it finally croaked. It first sounded like a very mild groan, less than two weeks after hearing the groan the fan finally crapped out. With a very loud roar, it stopped spinning. Good thing it was in the 20s with a wind chill of 15deg, otherwise the engine would've overheated. Ordered another one with hopes it lasts longer....
B0050NGB6O|5|This Caster Assembly is strong, easy to install and remove and does a great job of providing ease of locating a camper where you want it when you can't back it with a truck.
B006QZJAYK|3|No had to get new carbrettor as the bike would not run properly after
B004C1XQWM|4|I believe the product works as advertised. I dynoed the bike before and after and there was no difference in HP or Torque. It did dial in the air/fuel at exactly 13:1 through the entire RPM range. This is what I was hoping to achieve. I never had much of a problem with exhaust backfiring or popping, but any that existed was eliminated. The bike seems to run a little smoother, but that observation is anecdotal. I've had it on since March 2012 and around 14,000 miles and the unit has performed with zero problems. I ride a 2006 Honda VTX 1800C with a K&N air filter and Hard Krome exhaust. I helps the overall performance of the bike. Four stars only because the PowerPro is pretty expensive.
B000E7UIWO|5|Nice assortmant
B000BQSL5E|5|This was a life saver at Disney World! There was torrential downpours during our trip and the Absorber was amazing at drying everything off. My husband thought it was an unnecessary purchase for our trip BUT when he got soaked I had him use it to dry his pants. He couldn't believe how well it worked. It is also amazing at absorbing water from hair.
B00FEUXUR6|5|Love it!I get so many compliments

B000LY4AC4|1|This is not a good helmet.  I have had to fix the jaw of the helmet repeatedly because the screw kept falling out. If this helmet gets a good review, they probably work for the company.  Think about your safety and spend the money on a good helmet.
B000NOUQRA|4|Sturdy, small, portable . . . I use it for jobs where I just can't reach. It folds and transports easily.
B003CN30X6|5|Wrong size, but fast shipping of a quality product
B004UL5V40|2|Button is very sensitive so light is constantly on. Silver metal part that holds the knife broke while in my pocket, no way to fix it.
B001F0I4SO|5|GM has a garbage design with these mirrors on their cars and it helps to have a affordable replacement for the likely 3-4 times that the mirror is going to break off on you (car wash, leaning on it slightly, bumping it with your hip, etc.).  The issue is there is no flex in the mirror in any direction and the mirrors are thin rigid plastic, that break easily.  Enough about that though.  As stated, for the price these mirrors are great and the fit is perfect.  Takes about 5 minutes to replace.
B004KK553I|5|Thanks
B003JH6HPI|3|Floor liners were not as sturdy as I expected but still work well as designed for my 2007 Toyota Tundra.  I had problems with the floor liner staying in one place on the passenger side and contacted weather tech customer service for resolution.  They were quick to address my problem and sent out Velcro strips to resolve the issue immediately.  Liners look great against my black carpet and seats and brings attention to the cab.  The customer service, by itself, is a great reason to make this purchase, on top of having a functional product.
B000Z0HVHA|1|The solder connections on the ends of the wire broke during my first use. The product was not expensive so I was not expecting much but it broke before I could use it one time. Would not recommend.
B00FVX9ZH0|5|These are a great help providing an easy buckle up in the car.  You know how the seat belt connector seems to disappear between the seats and is very hard to reach?  Well, get some of these and you can always find it.  Makes it so easy to click.  Highly recommended.
B00J51QLHG|4|Worked fine.
B00CX9BYT2|5|My Lt Col patient bought this rug for his &#34;Man Cave&#34;. It is thick and the colors are rich. Very nice high quality rug.
B000E721L0|5|Fit right up on a 2004 Ford Taurus 3.0L Flex Vulcan engine. Vehicle has over 130,000 miles and OEM unit gave out. No issues with seller or unit.
B000F15GLM|5|Great product.
B004LZH9D6|4|I recently purchased one of the exhaust systems for a U.S spec GTI MK6, Installation was pretty eaisy, although the raceland in-pipe was 70mm and the GTI pipe is 65mm so this leaves a considerable gap when trying to marry the two together, and this is impossible with the band clamps that are provided, the band clamps that are provided are 80 mm band clamps and DO NOT tighten enough to tighten the exhaust on either end.  Other then that it was a perfect fit. Also might want to mention that the stock exhaust needs to be cut, and the average home mechanic will have a rough time with the proper measurements. The MK6 GTI Exhaust from the CAT back is all one piece and does not clamp together. You will need more then one person to install. If your looking for sound out of this you will not get any different sound from the stock exhaust, as VW does NOT use the muffler to baffel the sound of you engine, If you would like a different sound you need to replace or remove the resonator (the piece between the CAT and the Muffler). The product arrived in perfect condition and in a very timely manner, 2 days.
B006WFSV1M|5|works great went for a ride today 12/02/2012 makes riding more comfortable used one on the brake side also my leg fits better around carb now
B00F7GYUOO|1|The size, colors, detail, etc was spot on. However, the colors started fading very fast after just one week. I would not recommend using this product outside or in direct sunlight.
B001TGH9OE|5|Between the Seal and wax both were great. Very easy to use on a clean truck. The look was like a mirror Finish !
B00ED4040A|5|I used these as backup lights for our Suburban. They put much more light on the ground behind the vehicle. So far I have not had any problems. Well worth the money.
B003YI421I|2|doesnt  bond  metal  that good, and  its  a over glorified super glue  with  some sand  bonding
B0014DINME|5|This battery/charging system/starter tester is a very well made piece of equipment and I recommend it to anyone! This company has many nice products.
B0095GK9SI|4|Easy to install and looks good
B0026Y81VS|3|came quick and worth the money...plastic tabs are cheap where it shuts and locks in over the tailgate...driver's side broke while i was installing it..yes my fault but i wasn't rough with it...
B009SAAK7G|5|Purchased this to use as reverse light on my F250. Wired it into my stock reverse lights and mounted it beneath the bumper.  Works great ! I will be ordering a couple more for up front to use on long highway trips at night. Can't comment on durability yet but housing feels well built. I'm very excited about mounting a few more.
B000FQ7BFG|3|In the picture listed, it shows the mounting to be the three hole plate. I should have read the description better, where it said they were made of PLASTIC. The mounting for this piece is just the top two holes, where I assume you slide it behind the plate on your windshield. It looks nice, but being that its plastic I dont have high hopes on it lasting very long. Its a shame, because its a great idea!
B0002SREPO|5|Did what it was supposed to do.
B001J60W3O|5|Purchased for my wife's 2003 Hyundai elantra (manufacturer date January 03). The car would turn over but wouldn't stay on, figured it wasn't getting gas as the starter and plugs are new. Was pretty sure the fuel pump (or the filter,strainer,regulator) has never been replaced. After replacement the car starts and runs again. This is a fantastic replacement as it allows you to drop this straight in and swap everything in one shot, rather than guessing at which item failed and dealing with opening the can and with individual replacement.<br /><br />Replacement process and tips: the fuel pump module is located in the gas tank but Hyundai was nice enough to make it very accessible. It is located under the rear passenger bench seat right in the middle and you access it from inside the car. There are two bolts at the back of the seat(one on each side),remove those bolts (socket wrench), you might have to partially lean the back rests down to get to the bolts) and then pull up hard on each side of the front of the seat to completely remove the back seat. It is not necessary to remove the back rest. You will see a black circle in the middle of the seat, pry it up with a screwdriver, it's just stuck on with black goo. You'll then need to remove 8 screws, clip and hose from the module. There are three rubber nipples that come up through the gasket, pop these out and it will be ready for a swap. at this point be careful when removing the module as it's likely full of gas, have a bucket handy to just drop it in. Replace and reconnect everything. Be careful with the attached gasket when you start to screw it down, a couple of the holes are off centered and you must line them up correctly. Rotate slightly until you can see all holes lined up. This module makes this an incredibly easy fix.
B000LNBLTK|5|I got these tools to remove the car interior.  It works perfectly and is scratch proof.  The material is excellent. The price is amazing low for its quality. I am glad that I found these tools.
B0038AV56W|5|Easy to install and looks nice
B001Y8NF90|5|Good to have,  keep eyes on straps
B00KL3ALGO|1|Doen't blok the sun. It falls regularly and it doesn't look good (lots of wrinkles no matter how much you try)
B000EDOTCS|5|Holds the Paper Towel Roll Nicely!
B0012X0MWU|4|Installed these struts on our 2005 Chrysler Town & Country without any major issues, the most difficult task was removing the sway bar links.  In all, I replaced the struts, the sway bar links and bushings, and the shocks (same Monroe family).  After the installation I had the vehicle aligned, and the shop thought it was a waste of money to have replaced the strut bolts, as recommended by Monroe: so skip this replacement item and save the 20 bucks.  Additionally, I had to retighten the strut mounting nuts after the units seated themselves.  I also needed to retighten the sway bar link nuts at the same time.  The ride has dramatically improved, but I would label it as stiff.
B003BZD03K|5|Work as intended
B000EDUTOA|5|OK, no longevity report here as I just got this recently.  What this is great for is mounting on your travel trailer or fifth wheel, so when you back into your camp site you can clearly see if the trailer is level without ever getting out of the driver's seat. It's great because sometimes all it takes is pulling ahead or back a couple of feet and you are level. Saves a ton of time.
B00HTWJBAW|4|Awesomeness!!! There is nothing to say other than thank you. I would of marked 5 stars however the chrome is fading a little bit and  about to paint it black due to chrome coming off but It's fine I wanted black anyways with red lettering.
B009EA9G4I|3|Mirror motor to move in and out isn't very good. After only two months and being used only a couple times to fold in at the bank it doesn't fold all the way in but for now the blinker in the mirror still works. Decent mirror for the price beats having a busted one.
B000WHACHC|3|This fits great in my 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan.  The only downside is the way the read cup holder hangs over the back of it - this was easily and quickly broken by my kid in the back seat.  It just sort of popped off.  When I looked in a retail store to buy another, the one in the package was broken in the same way - IN THE PACKAGE!  It's just the way it's built - simple leverage makes it inevitable.<br /><br />The thing is, this console is so great that I just left the rear cup holder sitting on there, slid it forward a bit, and kept it in my van.  It holds tons of stuff, has convenient spaces and the middle part holds everything.  The cup holders are great too.
B000CQHVJA|4|As described.
B005DLNQP2|5|Nice mirrors overall. Great pricing too. For the cost of one replacement mirror you get a matching pair. Fit well and look nice. Fully adjustable so you get a decent view behind.
B007GRH0IK|5|i had an hmf exhaust before and the rivets just fell apart on it. so i ordered this one just because of the price and solid build type and i could not be more satisfied with it! it comes with a quite core and spark arrestor.  with the quite core in, it is almost as quite as a stock muffler (which im concerned with because i use my bike for hunting as well as mud riding) and with it out i have to say it sounds pretty good. i highly recommend it.
B000IZ0386|5|All parts were well made and fit perfectly. Just as I expected from AC-Delco.<br />I put them on my Cadillac Deville. The brake install went very easy due to every part<br />was the exact fit. It comes with a small packet of brake lube. Make sure you have more on hand.<br />About 300 miles on them, work fine and no squeaks!
B001N3ZXJQ|5|A must have. It keeps the seats underneath looking new.
B000WJ64O0|5|Fits. Works. Big improvement over a naked wheel.
B008SCDE1Y|4|Bike: 2006 650R / ER-6F<br /><br />Cap works fine, but needs a spacer for the sealing ring. McMaster sells Buna-type square rings that brings the sealing ring to the correct height to insure a positive seal against any water intrusion.
B0009H523E|4|Used it on my 1965 mustang fastback 302 engine I bought plenty at that price, hard to find filter or my car without them taking out a lean against your car
B00FI7TXUS|4|These are great I have used them before, but for those that do not know how to install instructions would be helpful
B003LIX4EC|5|Made for Weber carb but fit my Holley 5210 just fine. Fitting for crankcase vent hose included. Easily installed on my custom Jaguar SS100 replica car.
B002PF4I2Y|2|The frames are ok, but the plastic screws and covers for the screws were no good. Very low quality on screws and covers.
B00EHN673U|5|It was what I expected and I highly recommend
B004RFKBEO|5|It is a great product Bikes are very sturdy. Caution, it is heavy and hard to set up, if you have a low car like it do, careful with dips on the road
B0058WXNOK|5|i used it fix a seat in my thunderbird it looks great it blends in great unless you,look hard you not notice
B000E301IY|5|Plug & play, this window regulator works perfect! Very pleased with it. It rolls up quick fast and in a hurry:)
B00I548SDY|5|Awesome Fit! Looks Great!
B005G50RNO|5|Perfect perfect perfect
B000C9Y1FY|5|It is becoming harder and harder to find Wix filters. And when I found a case for such a great price, I had to buy it. It shipped in atimely manner with plenty of communication along the way. I will be buying more.
B001F7EK3U|4|This was just what we needed for the car.  Made the car work so much better.  Price was great for the product
B000SL4AA2|4|Quite loud, but does the job.  I only use it for topping off my tires when the TPM light comes on.  It takes some time, but works just fine.
B00CLX09O6|3|It didn't fit my 93 wrangler.
B00B7R5LJK|5|I bought this for my sons 07' FJ. What a great product. It is durable and easy to clean. The price was right and would recommend for the people that don't always have time to clean their vehicle.
B00KT0OSKE|4|good product
B001FHQKUQ|3|Had it on only a few miles; temp. gauge seemed \\"off\\" and eventually, got a check engine light/fault code for \\"coolant thermostat malfunction.\\" P0128 -- read a low coolant temp.  R&R'd the coolant temp. sensor that came with part; even though it was \\"new!\\"  Blew another $18 at Advanced on a BWD sensor -- so far, no problemo!  Next time, I will purchase a bleeder sans the sensor, barring a next time!
B002UX7INM|3|good
B00JIJ4LWW|5|This is amazing! I have a huge leather chair and had not used it. It was very dried out. It is soft and supple now!<br /><br />Beautiful!
B002O30CGI|4|they need to be curved a little bit
B000GZOG2W|5|lifter's also worked out great!!! great product at a great price....
B00LBUTTBY|2|Bracket didn't last.  One USB port no longer functions.
B00KA3Z0X4|5|The coolest item I have bought to date !
B004JAP19C|4|I like this toolbox! It sits low in the bed of my Toyota Tundra so it is less visible and does not block my vision out the rear window. Because it is low profile, it holds slightly less that a standard toolbox. The box clears the front tie down hooks with plenty of room to spare. While the rotating locks seem more secure than the standard paddle handle locks, I was not all that impressed by the key cylinder nor by the lack of a clear \\"click\\" when locking the handles.   My toolbox was shipped without proper packaging (box was thin). It was damaged by some sharp object that punctured the box and put several deep gouges in the lid of the box. I kept the box rather than returning it since I needed it.   Shipping gets two stars (it arrived quickly but was damaged) while the box itself is five stars. Shipping was the reason I give the overall transaction four stars.
B00394N8Y4|5|Worth every penny
B000Y5CTV4|5|I dropped my helmet and the face shield cracked off.  The replacement I purchased is smoke color instead of clear and I'm very pleased with it.  I will definitely be a repeat customer if the need arises.
B009PJJWYM|1|Didn't even last 6 months. Total junk!<br />As many others here have stated, the rubber is subpar. It has broken down and the car now clunks over bumps.<br /><br />Also the bearing seams to be garbage. I can hear my springs get stuck as I turn the wheel.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!
B004F8U7SS|5|Mr. Gasket 33027G Engine Lift Plate<br />Great product nice welding on top unlike some others for sale at this price point.<br />BUY THIS ONE!!!!!!<br />BUY WITH CONFIDENCE<br />RagenRat
B00HRZG9H4|5|It fits nice and tight. Easy to install. It hasn't rained so I not sure about keeping water out but I guess will have to wait till winter. But so far, great!
B0024ECIP0|5|It met my expections.
B001UG4WIO|5|This came quickly, met my expectations exactly, and was easy to put on the car. Not too large, but big enough to enjoy it!
B00MG07R80|5|I've already gone through a car wash, and the vinyl has held at pretty well.  I think it will last a very long time.  Already got a lot of laughs and comments about it.
B00EEGH0DQ|3|Appearance is what I expected but getting them to work properly has been a real pain. My vehicle is pre-led and I purchased with the right year etc., so they should have worked right from the box, but the built in resistor is inadequate to stop hyper-flashing. There were no instructions to add resistors which I shouldn't have had to do. The existing resistors from the auto parts store were sub-par which made matters worse. Once I got the resistor problem worked out they are good looking and are bright. Many smoke lights I see on the street make it so you have trouble seeing them.
B000CB6D2G|5|Good filter for my Ural
B000KL3894|3|This is a good product if you are looking for something that will cover your whole floor. It is made of a plastic and not rubber. My feet would slide more on this piece and did not fit my truck like a glove as it was supposed to do. There was a little bit of a gap between the front left side on the driver floorliner or if you pushed the liner up to fill that then there was a gap between the seat and the floorliner. With this gap the floorliner started to move back and forth and since I was not sure if I was going to keep it I did not try the floor clip that came with it, that was supposed to hold it in place. I only tried the driver side floorliner and if it fit like a glove, like advertised, then I would have loved it and kept it. But I returned it and bought the all-weather Husky floor mat. It is made of rubber, so my feet do not slide, however that floor mat interferes with the gas pedal. So I am not sure what I am going to do with it. The Husky floor mat was about 40% cheaper though.
B006OQ48OI|2|If you're looking for a very cheap blanket that will fall apart the first time you use it, this is the one for you. I returned mine because I was not satisfied with the quality. Will keep looking for a better one.
B000XBCURW|5|BEST on the market ! no sticky armrest or dashboard.
B0002SRGI4|3|This product is what it represented to be and  Does the job the steel however is soft on the space sleeve  And deforms with use.
B003V94KIK|5|I now have a set for both the jack and the wrench and will always use whenever i have a flat.
B0001EFSTI|5|Very good design and super useful. It isn't noticeable so it is great!
B00DYOVXZ0|5|Works great with iPhone 6+.
B0015KTWJE|5|fit perfect.. suggest wire brush and coat with heat paint last twice as long.
B00598SNK2|2|I put these on my car in September, its now November, and the one on the front it cracked already.  Guess I'm gonna buy the silver metal ones instead
B0002U2V1Y|5|I was a bit skeptical but for the price I thought I would try it anyway.  The clay bar system was very easy to use on my 2008 Acura.  This is a car that is my daily driver and I don't ever wash it or wax it.  After I washed the car I did in fact feel containments on the surface of the paint so I had a good starting point, I followed the directions keeping the clay bar wet using the included spray bottle.  I got to admit that after going over the whole car, the containments were no longer present.  I washed the car again and then applied a coat of wax.  The car looks and feels brand new with the exception of the obvious paint chips and other wear and tear.  The car has 100k miles and looks almost brand new.<br /><br />I will use this product again
B0040CTYBU|5|The clips underneath the front air damn were missing. I tried universal 8 mm screw-in clips but they did not work. These push-type clips worked flawlessly. Very easy to install and they hold the panels together securely.
B00466L2GU|4|Had some minor imperfections so I would not give it 5 stars.  For the price it was alright for no more than I do tires
B008ELZ15G|2|Sirius radio shook so bad that I took the mount off of my Electra Glide
B000CCFIU8|2|These are generic with Ignited name! Past product was great and better quality. Its a shame Ignited has succumbed to selling junk!  Amazon customer service is the best! They consider a customers satifaction and the return was not a problem.  Thank you Amazon.
B001A4EAV0|5|Good product!<br /><br />- drain/refill your coolant without putting a mess<br />- easy to bleed air of the coolant system<br />- easy to use<br /><br />Wath video on youtube to drain/refill and bleed air out of your coolant system if you don't know how to use it. It's so easy with this funnel.
B000AP57TO|5|Bike runs normal before was too rich, even the choke works wheer before the chock would kill the bike<br />i have better millage as well
B007EHOWNI|4|Excellent on time product.
B00HRMSU1K|5|This kit had all the interior and license plate bulbs in one shot so I didn't have to search for the different types separately. The Festoon type bulbs are just a slightly smaller diameter so you will need to squeeze the prongs together a little in the sockets but no big deal. Lights look and work great.
B006A571BA|5|Came fast. Looks good.
B005SEJTUA|5|quality product
B0002SQUFY|3|Tried to use this tool on rear brake piston on a 2002 Honda Accord.  I found it hard to line up with the slot and it slips out easily.  I used a wide prybar instead, and the pry bar worked much better.  Also, this tool is made in China.
B00AZJYDQI|3|How chuck seem to be more durable than others on the market with a clip to hold it on the valve stem.<br /><br />It operates like a conventional chuck but is awkward to use attached to the end of an air hose by itself because of the clip for the valve stem.  It is best to use it in combination with a hand controlled air gauge.<br /><br />Then you can secure it to valve stems in difficult to reach places like the valve stems on my tractor tires that are on the inside.  Once secured to the valve stem you can add the amount of air needed with a hand operated gauge without having to hold the cuck on the stem.
B00MXWJ5QS|1|It did not fit my car. My car is automatique.
B008A16CDK|3|Cheap! Thin material that ripped the<br />first time we put it on and we were being careful. Then it ripped again in another place w/ the slightest wind. Too thin!
B000O707IO|5|I got the charger on time and it is working as advertised. I believe it has increased the capacity of some old batteries (12v, 9 Ah) that initially showed about 50% capacity (which was about what I thought), and now they're over 75% - probably increasing further. I'm running them through a Pulse Tech Xtreme Charge Quadlink XC-QL4, which is also great.
B000R2RBEY|4|Visit HYUNDAI dealer they gonna setup for my car (extra spend money required)<br />Simple and Easy installation if you pay to dealer.
B00180P03I|3|i wish i could attach it to the retainer on my car so it wasn't loose
B000VAQA08|5|Rotor was exactly what I had expected, part # cross referenced easily with other sites for comparing features and pricing.  Rotor was 1/3 the cost of the same \\"premium\\" rotor from my local Napa auto parts store.  Has a nice expoxy type coating on the fins and area of wheel contact.  $9.00 more than my usual source @ [...], but I came out $2.00 ahead with free shipping.  Arrived in about 4 days, thought it would take 2 weeks or so.  Would buy again if available down the road
B00AU4F74K|1|It didn't work
B001LMWQ44|5|excellent
B0015PMZMU|4|I had never used a flaring tool , so it took a couple of tries before I began to make perfect flares.  After that it was fairly easy and id did a great job.
B008FCD0SE|5|These are a gm product and fit perfect, def happy I went with these, they match my std tailgate protector pattern that gm puts on the trucks standard.<br /><br />Also, they come with stake hole plugs, a really nice feature to be able to put on and fill the holes when not in use! If you look around most don't have this feature, a definite plus!
B002PQU6UQ|5|These lights replaced my factory fog lamps that were sand blasted with 105,000 miles of road debris and the chrome falling off the back of the lights. My old lights weren't as bright as the parking lamps!!! The new lights preform like the OEM lights, were easy to install and came with the bulbs. I stopped by the Ford dealer and priced replacement lights from them with a total quote of $176.38. I'm glad I purchased these lights.
B007ILBVDO|2|advise the costumers not buy those because they are not success. I did use them every day that still is hot even opened little windows so I placed four shades on one side of left window. Very little help..so I wasted $$ on those.
B004BCBZUM|5|Great quality, ready to replace the hold headlights it come with all the hardware, just clip out the old and clip in the new !!!
B0014K66BC|5|Love it! Used it to personalize my Kindle :)

B000C8ZFRI|5|Extension pipe fit my 1994 Chevy Extended Cab perfectly. Installation was quick and easy.  Shipment was quick and arrived before estimated delivery date.
B000AP452E|5|This item worked for my 2009 Grand Vitara. Comfortable to the hand. The chrome metal top plate ensures it always stays shiny. Use the longer screw as the center screw.
B0071I3NEO|4|Exactly what I wanted  but could have had instructions.
B00IX69WHA|4|Great product and even better customer service. Had a fit issue with the shocks but they we quick to correct the issue. I would definetly recommend them to friends and family, I'm that pleased with them.
B001FKJL40|3|Guess it's my fault or maybe it's the vendor's. In 2007 the V70/S60 came with eitheir steel control arms or aluminum arms. THESE ARE NOT INTERCHANGABLE! The ball joints are different and the angle to which the arm comes to the ball joint is different also. I guess I could've looked before I ordered, but I took the word from Amazon that it would fit.<br />Also, the price was too good to pass up.
B004KK553I|2|I bought this less than year ago but now it has turned completely yellow. It never looked as sparky as it does in the picture. It came with plastic screw covers that looked like crystals... tacky. Not only that but one of the covers was way too big so I couldn't even use them.
B00I6VTUWY|5|This is such an affordable and a smart investment for “just in case” moments. I recently moved to a new city and I’ve learned that people in my city are not the best drivers (Los Angeles). I’ve seen many car accidents where cars were flipped sideways and upside-down. I feel safer with this tool in my car, just knowing it is there in case something unfortunate happens. It is lightweight, sturdy, and very compact! I currently have it in the driver's side door, within reaching distance. I hope to not use it one day, but if I do, it would be easy to use right out of the case. I highly recommend this tool for every vehicle!
B005ZZLRF2|5|Easy to install, painted nice, came out good, recieved alot of comments on its looks
B00BJCHTFW|5|works great
B000BYD4JY|5|Good wiper with easy installation!
B002LOG598|2|While it does it's job it has some flaws. The sensor is tricked by itself whenever anything is too close to it, or when you walk past it. What I mean is the light is reflected by another object and turns the night light off, which causes it to start flickering rapidly!    Also, it doesn't rest easily against the wall, at least not on my outlets.    The most annoying part of this nightlight is the installation. You have to screw it in in the same area that the bulb is positioned. Take the bulb off and screw it on, right? Well - again, on my standard electrical outlet the measurements appear to be off so I am unable to screw it in with a perfect fit AND it's a little difficult to screw in because of the mound that holds the bulb in.    Either way, the product does work and does create a safe nightlight without worrying about my toddler burning himself on the bulb or removing the night light to expose the outlet. I will use the product, but if given a second chance I would have found something else.
B000GTXST0|4|chain seems well made, and fits the sprockets like a glove. have a 1982 Kawasaki 550 LTD I stand it up from first gear and ride it on the rear wheel thru sixth gear at 45 miles an hour.
B0013RIOPC|5|I was shock, thought the would cheap and wouldn't last long but to my surprise they held up past my expectations.  Will shop some more.
B002OUMVWY|5|I would recommend buying the extension....just in case.  Tough material.  Fits perfectly and have never had an issue.  When it comes to dumping.  No news is good news and I'm glad to say I've got no news to report.  I've used this from day one and will never use anything else.
B00JIDIHXM|5|Great!
B00FFV16BG|5|Perfect factory new part
B002M1BWM0|5|It worked !!  That was the important thing.  And it fit as described.
B00LMO7024|1|Didn't work....
B006MX81FA|1|Advertised as leather, but looks and feels like thin vinyl. Very disappointing. Don't waste your money.
B009FZWF3Q|1|I was gonna buy this product but when I saw all the bad reviews I decided not. The product seems poorly built I wouldn't buy this and I wound NOT recommend.
B000CAINRK|5|Sheepskin covers arrived as described, they were packed well and arrived promptly. The dark gray sheepskin color matches the interior of the truck. Thanks MJH
B000LEPT5G|5|Exactly what I needed. Good price for it compared to stores. Worked like a charm and it had a book of all the trouble codes. Very helpful
B002PX9Z6A|4|Just don't get your prints all over the sticky side.
B003V1DDK4|5|Bought this for an older '68 Sears garden tractor I was restoring.  Turns that old Tecumseh motor over no problem.  It's not an exact fit as it claims, just a lil common sense and a few shims and it will do the job.
B000BO8X9K|5|Works perfectly, and heats quickly.  It is thermostatically protected, so that it heats the coolant to a preset temperature, without overheating.  I got this to replace a failed unit on a tractor, so installation was easy.  The hoses already were plumbed, all I had to do was remove the old one, and install this one.  It comes with new clamps, and a couple fittings that would be helpful in a new installation:  a mounting bracket, a tee fitting, (to tap into a heater hose), and a fitting with threaded ends, (to connect to a threaded hole in the water jacket of your engine block), and a simple instruction/installation sheet.  You supply your own tools and any extra hose you may need.<br />Now my tractor goes from a sluggish start at 30 degrees to starting right up at 15.<br />I have one of these, and another rated at 1500 watts, and unless you have something BIG to start, like a 100+ HP tractor, I'd suggest going with this one, as it seems to be all I will ever need on an 80 HP tractor, and draws under 10 amps, so you can run two at a time, on a single 20 amp circuit.  The 1500 watt heater draws somewhere around 13 amps, and almost needs its own circuit.
B00DWA173E|5|Good price with good quality!
B005R4L3LO|1|both lights weren't sealed properly.  waste of money.  stay away.  also they don't look like this because there is a clear piece of plastic covering the exterior of the light and it looks nothing like this and it ruins the look.
B000CCFXYY|4|I used it on something on my dash and it's holding up so far...still watching it to see if the sun will make a difference.
B00HR8CDBC|5|Installed in my 370Z as back up lights. They are super bright and work great.
B00029XBBY|4|I actually don't use this tape for pin-striping on a vehicle at all. Instead I use it to label professional audio gear in a very subtle manner.<br /><br />I use this tape (in several colours) to label microphones, cable ends, microphone stands and other gear that can be easily mixed up on a stage. The coloured marking also helps to quickly troubleshoot cable runs on a busy stage.<br /><br />The tape sticks very well to smooth surfaces if carefully applied and is just bright enough to be seen but not so bright that it looks out of place. Most users would almost think the marking was already on a microphone from the factory as it looks that professional if carefully applied. I had previously used 3M coloured electrical tape for cable ends and lower visibility gear, but over time the adhesive in electrical tape would bleed and not look as good and need to be replaced.<br /><br />I would also think this tape would work well for tools and many other uses. And compared to electrical tape which does not tolerate heat very well and starts to shift, this tape seems to set even better if it gets warm such as when exposed to the hot sun.<br /><br />Oh, and it is possible to remove this tape if you should change your mind. (Although I haven't tested it for an extended period of application)
B008EG66BO|5|Works good and at a good price!
B00HV20ISO|1|Had them on<br />My Honda Accord all chrome started to fade in spots all over .junk
B000NWA6FY|5|Love OEM products, fit perfectly!
B003WC4G26|5|Wonderfully made out of heave metal, came very quickly too.<br /><br />Very happy with it and would buy from them again.
B004L5WLZ2|5|I was pleasantly surprised with this shine enhancer.  After waxing I used the &#34;Black Light&#34;.  Then the finish really popped.  Easy on, easy off.  It doesn't get any simpler.  Seems to work best with microfiber.
B002EIE2J6|4|Lifetime filter, just clean/wash it and add K&N oil every 4-6 months. Saves money in the long run so definitely worth the cost. Fits perfectly with no issues on my 2010 Honda Fit Sport. A little pricey however.
B003M1EMTE|5|This Door Handle works great on my 1992 4-door Honda civic. Looks and feels firm and sturdy. No complaints (yet). I recommend it!
B0009IR0PQ|5|Great item!
B00ATGGRMU|5|It looks good I bought 4 pcs. and I will buy some more. Great seller I highly recommend.
B00MWEODFK|5|Makes my car looks so badass
B00AWYWVK6|5|Everything I expected.  A nice accent piece for my black 2008 Trailblazer. I recommend you buy a lock for it as dishonesty might be tempted.
B001KQCBD2|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 Audi a4. these are for the Rear. Used EBC Brakes DP3680C Redstuff Ceramic Low Dust Brake Pad with these rotors and its awesome! great stopping power and very low brake dust. highly recommend especially for someone who drives a bit fast and does heavy braking.
B006N933VU|5|Fits thanks
B005VZXUXI|1|Amazon really does not know vehicle after market parts very well. It's been two times in a row that they have said it fits my vesicle and when I put i on my vehicle it does not fit! Also, I don't like things made in Taiwan when I am installing it on my Honda! At least it should be Japanese made and not a copy of the real thing!
