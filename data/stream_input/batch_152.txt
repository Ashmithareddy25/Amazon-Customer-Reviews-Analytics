B00000263T|5.0|Despite what some may say, this is the top of the line product from Accept.  Heavy but not overbearing, Metal Heart rocks with intensity.  The five members of Germany's best band are in perfect sync and Wolf Holfmann's solos are outstanding.  Yes, I even like Udo's shrieking voice.  Best songs are &quot;Midnight Mover&quot; and &quot;Screaming for a Lovebite&quot; (an Accept classic) and &quot;Bound to Fail.&quot;  The only weak link here is &quot;Teach us to Survive.&quot;  If you were to have only one Accept CD, this should be it.
B00004YKUY|4.0|I grew up in the 80's listening to punk and new wave, so I never considered myself a Journey fan.  (Even though I slow-danced to &quot;Faithfully&quot; and &quot;Open Arms&quot; at many a high school dance.)  I just recently got into the group by influence of my boyfriend who was a die-hard.  We saw the band live in 1998 and was blown away by Steve Augeri.  His similarities to Steve Perry are uncanny.  Regardless of the comparisons, Augeri's voice and range are quite powerful and can hold their own.<br />The last six tracks of &quot;Arrival&quot; are the best.  I listen to the CD and hear not a Steve Perry sound-alike, but a performer with such soul and depth that you forget you're listening to Journey at all.  Even the sounds of Schon, Cain, and Valory seem to have evolved.<br />It has been a long time since I've come across a CD that I can play over and over without ever tiring of it.  &quot;Arrival&quot; is a real winner.
B000056VIY|5.0|I love all the lyrics of the songs.  I love the RYTHM.  I love it.  There is nothing negative I can say about the CD  I love every single song of it.  If you really listen to the lyrics of the songs.. Im sure you WILL love them too.  Becuase, you can relate to all of the songs.. if its that you are in love.. you like someone.. you just broke up with someone.. Or you have a crush in someone.. [darn].. its the CD to LISTEN TO.. I really enjoy hearing the CD so GO AND BUY IT! ITs worth your [money] :)~
0789723107|5.0|I can't say enough about this book.  Great examples and good explanations of the logic behind web usability.  We use it every day to evaluate what's good and bad about our sites and where we want them to be.  For anyone involved in designing or helping to determine the direction of a web site, it's a must-buy.
B00004YKUY|3.0|Hey, I'll give them an A+ for effort, but if they wanted someone that sounded like Steve Perry, why didn't they work with him to get him back? While it sound's like Journey &amp; it looks like Journey, it's just not the Journey from before without Perry. I have all their previous albums/cd's, but I was disappointed in the new &quot;Arrival&quot;
0790729601|5.0|This one of those tongue in cheek super pace action flicks that Arnold is famous for making. There are lots of humorous moments from the Mafia guys to fighting CGI Alligators and falling out of a jet plane without a parachute only to catch it on the way down.  Anyone who takes this film seriously needs some mental help. But it's a great ride and thoroughly enjoyable.
0743201140|2.0|I love the overall point of the book: Individuals and companies would do better identifying and focusing on strengths rather than trying to fix weaknesses.  There are neurological reasons why focusing on strengths is the more rewarding direction to take.<br />However, I found the evaluation tool offered by the authors to be weak (i.e. inaccurate).  After completing the evaluation I read through all 34 &quot;themes&quot; and evaluated them for myself using the principles outlined in the book (e.g. you are energized when expressing the theme).  Of the 5 themes uncovered for me by the evaluation, only 2 are accurate.  The other 3 are far overshadowed by other themes in my life.  So...like much else in life, to thine own self be true.  Skip the evaluation and just read the book; either on your own, or with the help of family and friends you'll be able to figure out your own themes.  Also, like some of the reviewers before me, I think the restrictions around the evaluation (only one per book, and no retakes) are suspect.
B00005B1EX|5.0|I saw this tour and was blown away!  I couldn't hear for for 4 days.  All the tracks on this album are very clean.  By far the best live album I have ever heard.  Halford at his best!
B00004XOWM|1.0|Great for a skeet shoot that is. MAYBE it deserves 1 star for the Weiland appearance, because that's about the only song I've listened to more than once. True Bizkit is over, we saw it coming with Significant Other, this reinforced it. The Rap Remix of Rollin' will make your eyes roll (to any old Skool Bizkit fans). And rippin' on Trent and NIN went over the line. My official position? DEATH TO ADDIDAS ROCK!!!!
B00005B1EX|5.0|This is Halford at his best.  Play this one LOUD 'cause this is groundshaking metal at its best.  This is quite possibly the best live recording I have ever heard (and I am not just saying this because Halford is The Metal God).  If you buy one album this year, this has got to be the one.  If you missed Halford on tour, pick this up, crank the speakers, and blast this one out.  I just can't say enough good things about this album.  Everything from his early Priest days through the latest solo album.  If you consider yourself a Metalhead, you MUST own this album.
B000059H99|5.0|Buying DVD's, when you already own the VHS version, can sometimes feel like a waste of money.  However, added footage can always be the selling point.  That's exactly the case with Rocky.  When you have seen this movie as often as I have - it's gotta be in the hundreds - it's refreshing to finally get some insight into the making of this classic.  The commentary by Stallone is very funny and gives you a fresh look at how this film came to light.  Sadly, Stallone has never kept his edge -or eye of the tiger- with many of his later films.<br />My favorite feature of this DVD is the commentary track that goes of the entire film!  Comments from the directors, producers, and actors (Shire, Young, and Weathers - but no Stallone!) are continuous as you watch the film.  That is perfect for the big fan who has seen the movie many times but wants to know more about the fight sequence, for example.  <br />Special features sell DVD's.  Stallone figured this out and released Rocky again.  Sadly, I don't think 2 -5 have special features.  Otherwise, I would already own the boxed set.<br />Rocky, by itself, is a must-own DVD.
B00004WLXZ|2.0|Overall, the picture was somewhat of a disappointment. While much of the footage is interesting from a historical point of view,the photography has not been digitally remastered. As for content, a more descriptive title my be &quot;Hitler Goes to a Parade.&quot; It becomes repetitive for the length of the film.   The narration, does nothing to enhance the film. &quot;Hitler put himself on a pedestal.&quot; We know that. What we want to know is how does a tryant like Hitler take control of a couple of million people and bring them and himself to total destruction.
0141000198|4.0|I read this book with great reluctancy.  A friend of mine recommened it strongly..  but I had to ask myself: Who the heck is Bridget Jones?  and why would I care about reading her diary? One day I picked it up to see what all the fuss was about and after two pages I couldn't stop laughing.<br />Bridget Jones sees life from such an interesting point of view...  she is crazed, loony and neurotic, yet at the same time she is like many of us.  She makes promises to herself to bettter her life, but usually gets distracted by someone or something else along the way.<br />Like John Lennon said &quot;Life is what happens to you while you are making other plans&quot;.<br />She is trying her very best to get what she wants, but usually the outcome is well handled by fate instead.  Finally, in the end, she ends up getting most of what she wants.<br />Highly recommened if you need a good laugh at the misfortunes and misadventures of life.<br />must write book review on second book now and try to be brilliant yet humble in a serious, pseudo-journalistic tone...
6300273016|5.0|Johns Densmore once called Jim Morrison a &quot;Media God&quot; and he said it better than I could. It's too bad that this video is not available because it's a revealing look at the Media God. I haven't seen this in about a year, but certain images still remain. For example, John Densmore said that at first he wondered if Jim would be able to perform because he was so shy that he mumbled into the microphone. He also said that Jim would never pace himself. If he had a concert to do, he would show up after being up all night. Sometimes he would roam in the concert halls before a concert, talking to all the fans. After the concert, Jim was known to continue to party. No wonder Jim died at 27. He lived each moment like it was his last. This video also shows Francis Ford Coppolla's &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; section of &quot;The End,&quot; commenting that Jim would have loved how Coppolla used the song. I would love to own this video because now even the movie rental store no longer has it. Let's bring this one back!
0812550706|5.0|Battle combat in zero gravity. Saving the world from alien extermination.  To many these may start to sound like some sort of Star Wars rendition of The Matrix, but when the hero of the story is merely seven years old, things take a more interesting twist. Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game follows the life of innocent Ender, barely out of toddler-hood, who is recruited into the military in order to train for combat against a force of ant-like aliens known as the Buggers. At an early young age, Ender is thrown into a school of other children like him whose training consists of strategic battle combat and survival.  Immersed in an intense world full of deception, jealousies, and competition, it no longer becomes clear who is the real enemy, and Ender's only chance of survival is to strive to be the best.   The book, winner of the Nebula and Hugo Awards, does not have the same level of complicated terminology or background common in science fiction novels that only confuses readers; instead Card used simplistic, straightforward narration to follow the dramatic trials that Ender must endure in order to remain alive. The actions and interactions between characters are realistically portrayed, leaving readers completely involved in the complex relationships so true to human nature. This book, a must-read, is a classic that is soon to appear on the silver screen. And Ender's adventures do not end there; Ender's Game becomes the first book in an extremely successful series of 7 novels by Card that remains one of the best loved in America, ensuring an entire summer of stimulating reading.
B000000H6Y|5.0|With such lines in the lyrics, how could one not find this album a true gem?  Type O Negative is easily one of my favorite bands. Moving from an atmospheric punk sound, they created the most beautiful yet depressing metal I have heard in my life. On this album they have their finest hour. Instant classics such as Christian Woman and Black No. 1 are bound to be faves for the majority of listeners. Other faves for me are the title track, Summer Breeze, We Hate Everything, and Set Me On Fire.<br />What always catches me about this album is how the band makes music with such a dark sense of humor, making mockery of whatever the topic of the song is. For example: Christian Woman makes mockery of Christians; Black No. 1 pokes fun at goth girls, and Kill All The White People makes fun of racism.  The music itself is very professional. Johnny Kelly is easily one of the better drummers today. Kenny plays a very melodic yet unsettling guitar, and Pete Steele's thundering voice and bass echo into your mind. The inclusion of keyboards only adds to the beauty of the music, and at times, makes it ever the more gloomy. A wonderful, first rate band and album. You must check this album out!! I also reccomend October Rust and World Coming Down.
0385335482|3.0|Had I not already read &quot;Bridget Jones'Diary,&quot; its sequel and numerous Bridget knock-offs, I might have thought more of this book.  Rebecca Bloomwood is a sweet, charming, albeit self-deluded, character.  Her story, however, is predictable and pretty much follows the Bridget Jones formula, right down the television gig.  Still, Kinsella's writing is crisp and engaging    and captures perfectly the thought-process we use to justify purchasing our shopping finds. This would make a great vacation book.
B00005B6C9|5.0|As a Bee Gee fan since 1967, when &quot;New York Mining Disaster&quot; totally knocked me out, I have to say that, 34 years later, the Brothers Gibb are still making beautiful, unique music. This album, starting with the irresistable title track, marks a return to the 60s and 70s, when they made their best music- strong melodies, flawless harmonies, first-class production, etc., but with a modern sound. It includes one haunting classic, &quot;Wedding Day,&quot; as well as outstanding pop songs such as &quot;Embrace,&quot; Deja Vu,&quot; (both would be hit singles if released under another group's name), &quot;Sacred Trust,&quot; and &quot;Walking On Air.&quot; Only one cut, &quot;Voice in the Wilderness,&quot; is a disappointment. If you're looking for a CD with 11 great songs by a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriter's Hall of Fame group(in the history of rock, only the Beatles' songs have sold more than theirs), this record's for you.
B00003CXMG|2.0|The biggest letdown of a movie I have seen in a while.  The lead character (ie Cameron Crowe as a boy) is way to perfect to be believeable.  The movie was shallow and boring.  The only character remotely interesting was &quot;Lester Bangs&quot;.  Somehow, I remeber the 70's as being distinctly different.
B000008H24|4.0|Apparently Warchild is a love it or hate it proposition.  I'm very fond of it, and I think it fits in well with both the albums that proceed and follow.  For the reviewer who &quot;doesn't know what was in Ian Anderson's mind&quot; at the time - Warchild is the soundtrack to a movie that simply was never finished.  Anderson released the album anyway, since it was essentially finished.  &quot;Only Solitaire&quot; may or may not be a response to critics - but it was written well ahead of the rest of the album, and was a part of the &quot;Chateau D'isaster&quot; tapes that were recorded just before Passion Play.<br />Because Tull's career is now so long, I think each album has to be looked at as part of the whole.  There is a lot of good music on Warchild, and it definitely leads the way into the albums that follow.
B00000IPAX|1.0|it sickens me how kids will worship any band shown on mtv/trl just because some idiot named carson daly will do anything for money. calling these guys punk is like calling the backstreet boys a real band with real talent (sure they sing on the cds...or do they and have stupid little dance moves but NONE of it is their own ideas and all just a creation to make money...and sadly it's working)sure people will whine about blink's 1st few albums were punk and this is where they sold out (um...they did have a pretty big hit with their last album)but their 1st few albums are the same as this...pop-rock with no talent (how can one go from being a popular jock prom king in high school to being a punk or in a punk band and pretending to know something about punk...which none of blink know anything about!)i'd advise each and everyone of you little blink fans to get rid of this band's stuff because money is the only thing they are in it for (the only way they will hang with fans is through trl)and pick up some GOOD/REAL punk like: stiff little fingers, the clash, the damned, the ramones, dead kennedys, fugazi, dropkick murphys, rancid, the casualties, blanks 77, the adicts, bouncing souls, the business, ann beretta, one man army, tilt, u.s. bombs, kid dynamite, the jam, circle jerks, germs, buzzcocks, crass, sub/hum/ans, operation ivy, the unseen nips, gc5, swingin' utters, f-minus, adolescents, x, fear, bad brains and the list goes on and on and on! that stuff there is punk rock that doesn't need a free ride and they are and will continue to not take free handouts from the large corperate music companies who control the bands and the bands have no control over what they are doing! down with mtv/down with this fake punk crap!
B00004NRWH|5.0|I first heard of Nickelback off of their &quot;Leader of Men&quot; video on MTV. I thought it was pretty sweet so I downloaded it. I kept hearing their music coming up on the radio and every song was awesome. I wasn't disappointed in a single one of their songs. It's a solid composition of music. I very highly recommend getting The State. You won't be disappointed.*****
B0000025ZK|5.0|I bought this album more than 16 years ago when it made its debut.  It remains at the top of my play stack.  So many believe that a David Gilmour album should be Pink Floyd (PF) set in disguise... for all of you I merely suggest you reread the album's title.  The set within the album is a departure from PF.  It is refreshingly simple and devoid of the layering of sound that weighs down some PF selections.  The album is not locked into a conceptual theme, but rather explores a wide breadth of emotions.  Perhaps most poignant is the quiet desperation of the final cut &quot;Near the End&quot;.  It speaks of faith, and belief in oneself, and the quiet strength it can take to face a day when there is little to look forward to.  The sound is different from PF but is unmistakenly recognizable as David Gilmour.  It is an about face and departure from the PF sound but it is a rewarding exploration of the different directions that can be taken.  It may be almost 17 years old, but is ages incredibly well.
B00000BKDW|5.0|Recently, thanks to some friends of mine, I have become an avid fan of Iron Maiden. But I must say that this is probably one of their best (if not their best). \\"Aces High\\" is one of their classic songs. This album, compared to their earlier albums, is not raw or hard-edged.<br />\\"Aces High\\" features some of the best drumwork ever in a heavy metal album. It's a great song that perfectly blends heavy metal with the flavor of flying in a jet.<br />\\"Flash of the Blade\\" features great guitar work and a great song which strongly resembles something out of a medieval story\game. I especially love the chorus (\\"in a corner forgotten by no one...\\"), performed in spectacular fashion by Bruce Dickinson.<br />And of course, this features their 13-minute juggernaut, \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\"  One of their best songs ever.<br />these two are my favorites, but there are other good songs that weren't mentioned that are on the album. I strongly recommend this album, and get some of their later albums too. I also recommend obtaining albums by Judas Priest and OLD Metallica, who have produced masterpieces.
B00003CWTI|5.0|it's an amazing piece of work and has stayed with me all the this week since i saw it. it resonates on so many levels, lonliness, realization, family relationships...aimee mann's music fits so well into the film, you aren't even surprised when the characters start singing halfway through the movie. i'd agree with prior reviewers that, even at 3+ hours, something would be seriously wrong if anything were removed. it's extremely well-crafted, meandering and beautiful film. the only problem i had with the film was tom cruise. never a strong actor to begin with, he almost manages to wring a believable performance out of the script, when he's clearly outgunned by the rest of cast, who are strong and incredibly understated.
B000059TEQ|2.0|Oh yes, this story to many older generation is the starting point and the beginning of love stories drama. The story of this movie is very touching but for now a days the acting is not all that.<br />I recommend reading the book. But still it is &quot;the&quot; classic love movie of all time..!
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower completely revamps the conception of the generic wallflower everyone knew in high school. Stephen Chbosky tells a true tale of someone who is not well liked in high school, a road not usually traveled by writers. The tale is spun in the form of letters to an anonymous person, never revealed throughout the book, which adds a mysterious spin on the story. I had very high expectations of the book given that everyone one around me had read the book and now swears by it. The book starts out with a very unhappy letter to the said anonymous person by Charlie, a freshman just starting out in high school with no friends for his best friend just committed suicide, the hatred of his siblings, and book for a companion. Since Charlie has so much free time, he runs through books like tissues, discarding one and immediately taking up another.  It is only when Charlie meets a nice guy in shop class called Nothing, that he luck begins to change and Charlie is thrown into a wild first year of the rest of his life. Charlie encounters everything from the intensity of his first crush to experiencing drugs for the first time. And yet he never fails to write a letter to his special friend. The book is about high school and yet only touches delicately on the hierarchy of the cruel world that kids exist in today. Stephen Chbosky sheds light on finding yourself in a particularly difficult time in ones life and shows that the worst situations bring out the best in everyone. Charlie being shy observes everyone around him and tries to memorize peoples exact moments so he can keep them in his mind forever, afraid that this dream will suddenly go away. I am very picky when it comes to choosing a book to read. The world is filled with bad books and I refuse to pledge my time to any one of them.  So reading this book was a leap of faith for me and it turned out this was one special exception of the world filled with ...endings. I somehow identified with Charlie; it was almost like he was telling me his day, step-by-step, play-by-play. I recommend this book because it might remind you of the good old days when you were the loser in the corner or the geek in the cafeteria and for once the wallflower prevails and that's the way it should be.
6305538018|3.0|I am a fan of odd movies.  In fact the more one has to think while watching a movie the better I like it.  However, this failed to deliver.  I am afraid that I found this movie almost border on being boring!!  It had a wafer thin plot which in conclusion didn't really make sense and I have to say that I really didn't care what happened to anyone by then!!!  I also have to say that I thought the characters to be ill defined, to say the least, and unsympathetic.  In fact I would go as far as to say I truly disliked the character of Allegra, if indeed that was her real character!!  In short I felt decidedly disappointed in this film as I had such high hopes as I started watching it.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's Review<br />The world of Sci-Fi has always been original, gripping, and intense.  Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card is no exception.  The novel is set in the not to distant future, where the world has ventured into the realm of space flight.  We meet our main character early in the novel, Ender Wiggin.  Ender comes from a gifted family blessed with intelligence and the ability to lead.  Ender is an extremely talented young man, who has anger control problems.  He has a brother who abuses him and parents who ignore him.  This make him an obvious prospect for the Imperial Fleet, or IF.  The IF is earth's military fleet, burdened with the responsibility of defending Earth from the \\"Buggers\\".  The IF is comprised of gifted and talented young children who could survive the long journeys of space flight.  These children are broken down and molded into efficient fighters and pilots.  The Buggers are the human race's newest enemy, a species run by a queen much like an insect infestation.  Ender is chosen by the IF to be the next leader who will save humanity from total annihilation.    Despite the danger of the Buggers on the horizon we come to see that the real threat is from within.  Ender is sent to a \\"training\\" school in space for new cadets.  The school is a weeding out process that pits the students against each other to see the strongest survive.  Through his trails at command school Ender develops into a person, a leader, and humanity's last chance.  The novel is extremely interesting and captivating.  You will not be able to put down this novel until you discover its shocking conclusion.  Ender's Game is written from the point of view of several different narrators.  Sometimes we see through Ender's eyes, others through a supporting character, and sometimes from a third person narrative.  For being only 324 pages, the novel is surprisingly deep, creative, and well written.  I found that seeing the future through a child's eyes was very thought provoking.  Although he is in the middle of a war and being constantly tested, he seems to start innocent and slowly come to understand the horrors of interstellar war.  Being a fan of Sci-Fi, I found it interesting to see the future in a negative light.  I am accustomed to seeing humanity portrayed at its pinnacle of enlightenment and understanding of the universe.  To see humans committing the same mistakes we have committed in our past helped me see what can happen if humanity doesn't learn from our mistakes.  In this dark future we have become xenophobes who fear the buggers because they are different.  Corrupt individuals control the world and people are controlled by propaganda and militarism.  In a way it reminds me of many wars fought in our pass.  The difference here is the nature of the conflict being in space, and that humans face complete extinction.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who wants to see the future of humanity shown from an open and honest perspective.  The novel has received high praised and has been honored with both the Hugo and Nebula awards.  I recommend getting this book and it is well worth its cost.  If you enjoy this book you can continue into the series because Ender's game has many sequels, prequels and parallel novels.  Go buy this book.  Now!
B000002I97|5.0|In 1970, when most of the country was listening to Hendrix, Cream, The Beatles and Airplane, a down-on-his luck Kentuckian got a reputation singing songs in hole-in-the-wall Chicago clubs.  This record is a faithful re-creation of those days.  Every song should send shivers down your spine.  Prine easily convinces the listener that all of these things have happened to him.  The songs bounce from funny (Illegal Smile, Flag Decal) to incredibly depressing (Sam Stone, Hello in There) to some of the tenderest love songs ever penned (Donald and Lydia, Paradise (a love song about a place)).  It's obvious from this record that Prine knew what it was like to live hard.  One gets the sense that he really understands Korea and Vietnam, addiction and love, loss and separation.
B000002HFU|5.0|This album always gets rotation in my system..one of the many classics by the Wu from '93 to '96..sure his latest joint wasnt much to be happy about..but return to the 36 chambers is undeniably a true banger..with production from the RZA..how could it not be.
6305508550|5.0|I actually know people who won't watch this because it so closely portrays their work life.  Stephen Root (Milton) and Ron Livingston (Peter) do a great job in this cubicle classic.  It has truth, humor, and a &quot;don't give a s*#@ attitude&quot; towards work.  Definitely a must buy for those computer oriented people out there like myself.
B000002JPA|5.0|Definitivamente el mejor álbum de Dream Theater hasta la fecha. Tengo 38 años y por mis oídos ya han pasado demasiados grupos de R'n'R, desde que con 15 años compré mi primer disco (de Sex Pistols por cierto).     Pocos grupos me han impresionado tanto en los 90's como éste. Los descubrí por casualidad en una revista que afirmaba que eran los nuevos reyes del rock progresivo e incluso los  comparaban con los mismísimos Rush (¡Qué ilusos y pretenciosos!, pensé).<br /> En consecuencia empecé a comprar sus discos y me fui enamorando de su música. El último que llegó a mis manos fue este y tengo que confesar que es el mejor. ¿Por qué? Muy sencillo: tiene un poco de todo, desde riffs furiosos hasta instrumentales envolventes, pasando por baladas &quot;quedonas&quot;; y por encima de todo ese &quot;chorro&quot; de voz del amigo James LaBrie, con esos agudos imposibles y provenientes de no se sabe dónde (creo que su voz no aparece tan nítida en ningún otro álbum).  Escucha TAKE THE TIME y sabrás a lo que me refiero.     He escuchado el álbum cientos de veces y no me ha llegado a cansar todavía. De los músicos poco se puede decir, si ya los conoces. Todos dominan sus instrumentos con gran maestría y no desaprovechan esta ocasión para demostrárnoslo una vez más: Petrucci, Moore &amp; cía. saben lo que se traen entre manos. Y la producción, por otra parte, la esperable: brillante.<br />   Otros discos de DT también son recomendables, por supuesto, pero no son tan brillantes en su totalidad como éste. Aquí no hay desperdicio, de principio a fin merece la pena, como la buena sidra. ¡Disfrútalo/a!
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is an amazing, amazing critique and representation of nineteenth century society.  All I have to say is wow.  This edition, however, is very small print, and definitely not easy on the eye.  I am reviewing this one because it was the version that recieved from school.  It is so enticing, once i reached about halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down at all.  I was delighted with the complexity of the characters and the way in which Jane Austen opens up the thought process of the main character, Elizabeth.  This is one of the few classics that deserves the word &quot;classic&quot; to be applied to it.  Pride and Prejudice is a must read for anyone, but requires a substantial amount of thought and maturity.  I loved it.
6304107218|5.0|this is a funny parody of it's a wonderful life that actually surpases the classic. It is funny, touching, smart and has some of the funniest songs precursing animaniacs. Really amazing!
0425107469|5.0|I have read a few of Dean Koontz books but this was my favorite by far. From the first paragraph the story sucks you in like a vacuum. I was just amazed by the creativity involved in this book. There are still several of his books that I haven't read but so far you can't go wrong with Watchers.
1565114582|1.0|Okay. I am not the type of person to write a book review. You all know the phrase about opinions; however, this book really got under my skin. <br />I caught part of an interview with Tracy Hogg on TV and I was intrigued by the idea of knowing your baby's cries. My son was 5 months old and though I had a pretty good handle on things I am always open to new information. This book was a real let down.<br />First of all, this book is really geared for a newborn. Many of her practices just won't work on a 5 month old. For example, her soothing method for sleep and crying just didn't work with my son at all.<br />Second, the section on the cries is so vague that you can't really identify which cry is which. I happened to hear her do a couple during her interview and those are the only two that I could identify.<br />Third, her information breastfeeding and solid foods isn't up to snuff. She states that breast/bottle confusion is a myth. This is soley her opinion and is incorrect. I lived through it and can tell you first hand that it is real. My advice is no bottles or pacifiers until nursing is well established, but no later than six weeks. Also, she makes it seem like breastfeeding's popularity is simply a trend and doesn't even metion the enormous health benefits. Though it is a personal decision, its benefits are no secret. She lost all her credibility by poo pooing th whole thing. Her recommendations for solid foods are equally uninformed. <br />It seems like Tracy needed to cover too many subjects to make a book of it. As a result, you get very little about a whole lot...
B000008H1R|5.0|This is simply one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  Overshadowed by great releases from The Stones, Zeppelin, and the Beatles, Benefit is an underrated gem that really shows-off the brilliance of Ian Anderson and his band.  Much like the later Beatles albums, Benefit has two distinct styles: folk-acoustic and straight power rock.  The acoustic side is wonderfully melodic with tunes such as Inside; For MC, Jeffrey, and Me; and the haunting Sossity, You're a Woman.  The rock side with Nothing To Say, Teacher, and the powerful To Cry You a Song really give Benefit a rock sound that is unique to Jethro Tull.  This whole album is a must listen from beginning to end.  Many people don't give Tull a chance because of their dislike for the flute or Aqualung.  I say that people that don't like Tull have never LISTENED to Tull.
B000056VIY|5.0|If you could rate a CD with a rating of a million stars, this would be the CD that gets it. The beats are fantastic and her singing has ameliorated since On The 6. The lyrics are stupendous and the way everything blends is just marvelous. Jennifer Lopez has really proved herself as a diva and I think we will be seeing a lot of her for a long time. On The 6 had a mix of dance songs and ballads. But J. Lo is almost all dance songs, which make my body move all the time. The two obvious ballads on this fabulous CD are \\"Come Over\\" and \\"Secretly\\". These songs create a kind of calm before and after the storm feeling. Now I will go into detail on each of the songs!<br /> 1. \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\"- A great first single!!! The beat is great and her  attitude is remarkable. You can totally tell that her love don't cost a thing through  these lyrics!!!!!<br /> 2. \\"I'm Real\\"- The beats for this song really make your body shake. This also  proves the growth in the way Jennifer expresses herself. She's real, and what you  get is what you see. You go Jennifer!!!<br /> 3. \\"Play\\"- Her follow-up single and a great one at that. The song shows that even  if people don't like her songs, which they should, she still wants to groove to  them. The best parts of the song are when she cusses. FUN!!!!!!!! DJ, you better  play her song, `cause Jennifer wants to dance with me.<br /> 4. \\"Walking on Sunshine\\"- From the title, you might think that the song is a  kiddie song. But, this  song is well written and talks about love in an awesome  way. This is one of my favorite songs on the album, and you will know why when  you purchase this CD. Jennifer and me are walking on sunshine, in the middle of  the night. And, it feels like we are somewhere above the sky. This song rises  above the sky for sure.<br /> 5. \\"Ain't It Funny\\"- The Latin grooves make this song my #1 favorite on the  album. Also, the way that Shalene Thomas and Cory Rooney assist Jennifer's  lovely voice add to the reason why thisis my favorite song on the album. Ain't it  funny how some feelings you just can't deny, and you can't move on even though  you tried. Well, it ain't funny that I can't move on, because this song will always  last.<br /> 6. \\"Cariño\\"- A great Spanish song. It shows her Latin roots somewhat, and is a  great song. Cariño, cariño, cariño, cariño. I gotta have Jennifer's love, cariño.<br /> 7. \\"Come Over\\"- I can't believe Jennifer would do a song like this. All this song  is talking about is sex. I know Jennifer is an adult, but this is too far. I love when  Jennifer comes over, because when she does it gives me feva.<br /> 8. \\"We Gotta Talk\\"- One song that tells about a guy playing hard to get. The song  blends in with everything on the CD. Ooh, Jennifer come and talk to me. We  gotta love thing.<br /> 9. \\"That's Not Me\\"- This song shows Independent Woman Jennifer. She says that  she has been trying to compete with a girl to get to her crush, but she can't do it  anymore. She will find herself. She can't sit and be passive. She won't tolerate it  anymore.<br /> 10. \\"Dance With Me\\"- No this isn't the Debelah Morgan song. This is a great  song that goes well with the name. The song is just a fun party song that makes  you wanna dance with someone. Dance the night away, party `till the sun comes  up!!<br /> 11. \\"Secretly\\"- This is such a good ballad, just as my friend said. It makes you feel  really good inside and says the things that I wanna say to my crush!!! Secretly, I'm  wanting Jennifer. And I'm hoping she wants me too.<br /> 12. \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright\\"- A song that is the anthem for all people breaking up  with someone. It says that she can't change the person she is with and that it is  better for her to live on her own.<br /> 13. \\"That's The Way\\"- Oh my gosh. I can't believe the extremity of this  monumental song. The lyrics, singing, beats, they are all good. This is also one of  my favorite's on the album. If you don't like this song, then you have serious  problems. Jennifer, I can give you anything if you promise to be with me forever.<br /> 14. \\"Dame (Touch Me)\\"- This Spanish-filled song really shows that she is a Latin  artist. This is a duet with another singer and they really go well together. Oh  Jennifer please! Dame, dame, dame!!!!!<br /> 15. \\"Si Ya Se Acabó\\"- A great ending to this wonderful CD by the astounding  Jennifer Lopez. The Spanish surely would sound better than an English version. It  makes me fall more in love with Jennifer. Si ya se acabó tu amor.<br />Overall, this CD is great. If you have the chance to buy it, BUY IT. You won't be disappointed.
0812550706|5.0|This book was great!!!!!!!!,even though Card never developed any other characters besids Graff and Ender(maybe a little bit of his brother and sister too).  It had a greta plot and the batles and the last fight was really cool.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending.  It wasn't what I think Ender wouldv'e done.  Other than that the book was really good.
B0000524E5|4.0|Coyote Ugly is a nice movie,and although it may not be apparent from the trailer or the pictures from the movie,there is a fine story included,to add to the pleasure of seeing beautiful ladies dancing to great songs on the top of a bar.<br />It is the story of a young lady,Violet,who leaves South Amboy N.J. and goes to New York to become a famous songwriter.There is one slight problem though,she has stagefright and it is not easy to make people hear your songs if you can not sing them.On top of that,her house gets robbed and she runs out of money.At that point,she learns about the bar named Coyote Ugly (why would a bar be named like that?) and  gets a chance to work there.In the meantime,she also meets Kevin O'Donnel,a young Australian and a love interest starts between them.The rest is the funny adaptation of Violet to the crazy and wild environment of Coyote Ugly and her struggle to overcome her stagefright to finally make it to the bigtime.<br />The songs are definitely worth mentioning,both because they are important to the story of Violet and because they are really beautiful.Leanne Rimes is the voice of Violet singing and she does a great job altering her voice to make us believe that it is really Violet singing.<br />The DVD includes a lot of extras,and also some deleted scenes which for me are the most important element of any dvd's bonus features.<br />Just don't bother with how cheesy the storyline is,and how much this movie looks like a lot of movies we have seen before.Then I guarantee you will have fun watching Coyote Ugly.
0553269631|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a while.  It is very sad; you can't decide which character is the worst off.  Mick, the gangly tomboy who is tryign to find some beauty in a harsh world, while also trying to deal with the problems of her family and the trials of growing up.  Dr. Copeland, the educated black doctor, bitter against the injustices shown his people.  Biff Brannon, the hardened restaurant owner, who shows signs of being a homosexual in a time when being a homosexual was not acceptable.  Jake Blount, the radical drifter, who talks and talks but no one listens.  And Mr. Singer, the deaf mute with a longing for his best friend, the only person who understands him.  All of these characters are fully drawn, and each one of them makes you care deeply for him/her, even though they are very hard to like.  You read on, wanting to know what happens to these people, and whether anyone finds happiness at all.  While the ending is not all that happy, the point is made.  Everyone is searching for something, whether it be beauty, like Mick, or understanding, like Mr. Singer.  And as the title says, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. My only regret is that I waited so long to read this book.
B00004VVND|5.0|Great movie even better on DVD.  Transfer looks good and is still as thrilling as ever.  Do yourself a favor and seek out the MGM DVD release.  It comes in a plactic keepcase, has 8 pages of very interesting liner notes/behind the scenes facts, and the original trailer.  Westworld, &quot;where nothing can go wrong...go wrong...go wrong...&quot;
078401213X|5.0|I saw this on video the day it was released to video stores. I was not expecting much, but much is what I got! This hyperkenetic, disjointed, mind-numbingly paced film is one of the more interesting independant films to pop up in a while. The main character feels that he can solve the &quot;pattern&quot; behind the stock market's seemingly unpredictable ups and downs. His theory makes him the target of wall-street corporations who want to make a fortune from his theory and, most interestingly, a rabbi who feels that his theory can help prove the truthfulness of religous texts. He drives himself mad, and the movie becomes just as insane as it's main character. While this IS a fantastic movie, I don't feel that the technique is as innovative and original as many say. Go find Tetsuo: The Iron Man, a 61 minute Japanese experimental film from '89, and compare the styles. Aronofsky owes more than a little to that movie... A fascinating film though... Check out the superior, though much different, follow-up Requiem for a Dream.
0061020680|5.0|I've started reading the Discworld series from the beginning since they've started reissuing the ones that were out of print.  &quot;Mort&quot; is by far the best I've read so far.  If they keep getting better as the series progresses, I'm going to have to restrict myself to reading these books at home because of the weird looks I get if I laugh at a book in public. Death is the most hilarious character in the book. Death has decided that he needs an apprentice so that he can look around a bit, do a bit of sightseeing on the Disc. Mort is the only boy in his town that wasn't offered an apprenticeship... until Death came.  He gave Mort the offer of a lifetime.  Free room and board, a great job, use of the company horse.  What more could Mort ask for? But Death starts spending more and more time away and Mort isn't quite ready to start taking over the job full time. This book explores what happens when someone doesn't die that the entire universe expects to die. Like I said, it's one of the *best* of the series so far, and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Totally awesome.  I just got it and have already watched it twice.  This weekend I will have to check out all the bonus footage.  These guys show that they are the most talented band out there.  For you guys that gave this low scores because it dosen't have Dolby Digital 5.0 surround sound shut up.  I can't believe you are complaining about this even though you admit that the concert is awesome.
B000005ALP|5.0|Eels album &quot;Beautiful Freak&quot;;especially track 5 ;&quot;Not ready yet&quot; is one of the best albums I`ve ever heard.Track 5 explaines to all you overwillingly helping everyday-therapists out there to stay calm and at respectfully distance to peoples problems. Track 5 is rough and soft,a fantastic guitar-line-tune;track 5 is the ultimate conclution of this album; It`s just beautiful.<br />arne
0380002930|5.0|I'm in seventh grade, and I have read tons of books in my life, but this has to be the best.  Throughout the entire book, the band of 11 hlessil(homeless rabbits)venture away from their home warren due to a fearful premonition by the small rabbit Hrair-roo(Fiver).  Along the way, they run into friends and enemies, surprise and danger, in their search for a new home.<br />Whether the rabbits are meeting new creatures or listening to stories of the great El-ahrairah, experiencing the likes of the outrageous seagull Kehaar or battling head on with the forces of Efrafa, you will find something excellent.  As their new leader Hazel-rah makes decisions with cunning where a human would break down and weep, they press on, searching for the ultimate life.  And as they do so, Hazel-rah finds the greatest honor for any rabbit in any time.
B000002BBY|5.0|What can be said about this cd? Fist of all...Oasis shaped the mid 90's with this amazing sophomore album...to not give it 5 stars is redundant and stupid in my opinion! Geez, Not enough can be said about  Noel's amazing songwriting  which is at its best in this one and I have utmost respect for him as a guitarist as well. Liam's straining voice sounds like a cross between jaggar and the who...he's the best rock voice so far to come out of Britain in my opinion! I also have to say something about the drum playing on this album...its outstanding!!! J/ listen to &quot;wonderwall&quot; or &quot;roll with it&quot; and you get a feel of such vibrant, ambient drumming that it j/ carries you from song to song. I j/ have to say that every song is great on this one...especially take note of &quot;don't look back in anger&quot;(my fave), &quot;morning glory&quot;, and &quot;champaigne supernova.&quot; You won't develop a true appreciation for this great rock and roll band unless you see them live, or listen to their live version of songs as well (G-mex in Manchester or Knebworth). I have all of their other albums and some bootlegs, but this ranks as my personal favorite. Cheers to Liam and Noel for bringing back British rock at its finest!
B000002B7U|5.0|i bought the cassette back in the past, and i have intentions on buying the cd soon. but i need to say that the music is really very nice, many of the songs on this cd that amazon.com sells appear on his live video titled if i am correct &quot;ultimate ozzy&quot; the songs do rock-they have very nice rhythms, and the vocals by mr. ozzy osbourne blend in well. the music and vocals have alot of feeling and energy. jake e lee does awesome work on the solos and his moves are fantastic as well as mr. sosa's moves. for me personally their moves with the music in the video recorded live concert is really something amazing. i suggest you buy the cd, the music is worth it ---awesome tracks:shot in the dark is a great track. the others are too.
078401213X|1.0|I DID MANAGE TO WATCH THE WHOLE THING!  MY WIFE WENT TO BED, I WISHED I HAD.  DON'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS. I DONATED MY COPY TO RENTAL AND I BET THEY HAVE TO GIVE REFUNDS.
0345349571|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best history books I've ever read.  The writing is superb -- and the level of detail is just right -- between anecdotal and exhaustive.  I wouldn't call it a reference book, but for an understanding of the period and an overall introduction to Continental Late Medieval Period, there is no better book.
B00003CXLF|5.0|This movie was absolutely delightful... It kept me laughing constantly because the humour was well delivered and written (thanks to the great Dr Seuss himself) and it was so full of fun. The friends i went with loved it too, and this movie made me love Jim Carrey even more. His facial expressions and portrayal of the grinch was so cool!! ggggggreat movie!!
B000005RFQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD!! IOMMI THE RIFFMASTER IS AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME MATCHING JOE PERRY/ ED VAN HALEN/ ANGUS YOUNG  AS THE BEST RIFFSTERS SINCE CHUCK BERRY THESE ARE ROCK GUITAR RIFF CLASSICS!! BILL WITH GEEZER AND TONY IS MAGIC REGARDLESS TO WHO SINGS...... TONY WAKES THE DEAD WITH THESE COMPOSITIONS AND ENGINEER ROBIN BLACK'S MIX NOW REMASTERED BRINGS THE BASS AND RHYTHM UP FRONT GIVING THE BAND A MENACING, DARK, AND HEAVY SOUND.  GEEZER CAN NOW BE HEARD TO BE THE FINEST ROCK BASSIST EVER! FINALLY IF YOU DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW IT YOU WILL HEAR THE WORLD'S NASTIEST AND HEAVIEST LOUD ROCK BAND.  IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY SET IAN GILLIAN ON FIRE LITERALLY WITH A TORCH AND ALCOHOL IN THE STUDIO. THEY SOUND AS IF THE  CENTURIES OLD ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE CASTLE THEY RECORDED THIS ALBUM IN WAS POSSESSED BY DARK SPIRITS THAT BLESSED THIS RECORDING.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I have to agree with other reviewers that 2.0 channel sound only is disapointing.   But the sound is very clear, and definitely showcases the amazing musicians which are Dream Theater.  Is it just me or are the sound levels low on the DVD?  I had to put it about 30-40% higher to get the same levels as other CD's. The concert is amazing.  You really get the feeling that you're watching something special, not just a standard concert.  THe extra singers and the psychiatrist on the stage really add to the atmosphere.  There's about 2 1/2 hours of live music here.   As well, there's tons of extras, interviews with Kevin Shirley, many fans, a nice photo section, and a running commentary featuring the band.  I haven't heard the commentary yet, and I've already invested about 3 1/2 hours on this DVD!  If you're a Dream Theater fan, this one's a no-brainer.
B0000399WI|4.0|This movie was awesome! Great story, great characters an very good performances by Robbins and Freeman. You really get absorbed by it. The movie gets 5 stars from me.<br />The DVD however does not. When I buy a DVD of such a good movie I want to see beyond the film, I want interviews, documentaries, and specially audio tracks with commentary by the director and/or main lead. This sadly was not featured and while production notes are at least something extra it is not something that you couldn't find on the web.<br />So please DVD makers: in the future when making a DVD be sure to put real special features, otherwise it's the same as buying the VHS version. I know picture quality and sound are better on DVD but frankly that's not what I look for when I buy a movie.<br />By the way, &quot;chapter selection&quot; does not count as a special feature. A DVD by nature should have a chapter selection.
B000002HH9|3.0|WANT is an incredibly wellwritten song. It's got to have one of the most thrilling intro's ever! Just yesterday I pulled this cd outand I've listened to WANTover and over and over! Unfortunately, excepting oneor two other cuts..I thinkit's a weak album. BUT, WANT is such a perfect songit makes up for the rest.
0441172717|5.0|If you are looking for an excellent story constructed by flawless writing then this is the book for you.<br />You may have seen the movie, TV mini-series but let me tell you this: Nothing will ever come close to reading the book together with your own imagination.<br />This is one of those books not to be missed.
B00000IQBM|5.0|This Classic Horror Film by the one and the only Stanley Kubrick who delivers a great horror film where a writer named Jack Torrance(Jack Nicholson) is the caretaker for the Overlook Hotel for the winter.  Some where during that period of time Jack got a bad case of writers block and tries to murder his wife, Wendy Torrance(Shelley Duvall), and his telapathic son Danny Torrance(Danny Loyd).  Danny finds out about &quot;The Shining&quot; while talking to with the Overlook's hotel cook, Dick Hallorann(Scatman Crothers).  If your looking for a great horror classic buy or rent The Shining.
0451198492|5.0|Thank you Mr. Clarke for bringing this book into existence!<br />The many ideas brought forth in the book (especially written decades ago)are so fresh and mind-blowing even as we review them today...<br />Read it and see if you agree.
B00005B6C9|5.0|This CD is a real mixed bag of treats...a wonderful variety of styles that showcase the wide range of talent these incredible guys possess.  I just wish they wouldn't make us wait years between releases!  Whether you're a longtime fan or a &quot;post Saturday Night Fever&quot; addition to the club, you will love this CD. New releases naturally invite positive/negative comparisons to previous work but that's difficult for me to do. I love just about everything they've done.  What I do find interesting though, is that, on their last CD (Still Waters), the songs were in a similar style, but they used different producers for each one.  On this CD, they handle all the production, but each song is sort of a different style of music. All this adds up to a multi-decade CD...a little ditty reminiscent of 1920 (Technicolor Dreams) with some 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and today mixed in. Now, if they would just be willing to release some specialty CD's like a beautiful Christmas CD (no Santa Claus is Coming To Town please!), perhaps along the lines of the beautiful &quot;In the Bleak Mid Winter&quot; that Robin performed last Xmas at a Welsh cathedral. (Guys, take note: Kenny Loggins did a superb non-traditional Xmas CD (December)-it can be done.) Or perhaps release &quot;Barry Sings Sinatra&quot; which was recorded at Barry's charity tennis tournament but only available by bootleg which I refuse to buy.  Barry, Robin, Maurice...we'll keep coming back for more...just keep 'em coming!  Thanks for sharing your talents and best of luck with this release...you deserve it!
0920668372|5.0|Someone introduced this book to me at a playgroup this morning wow! I read it right there &amp; was teary eyed with a big smile on my face... I came home &amp; ordered a few!  It's not just for those with boys, it can apply to girls too.  But being a Mom to two boys, it really hit home.. the author starts off with a Mom signing to her newborn boy &amp; then follows him throughout his life, always picking him up signing a certain little poem, even when he is an adult.. it is then the &quot;boys&quot; turn to hold his sick Mom &amp; the story begins again when he is signing this poem to his baby daughter... for me, I thought of my husband who lost him Mother several years ago.. I think he will appreciate this book also... the story has beautiful meaning &amp; great illustration.... I would highly recommend this book to one &amp; all!
0812550706|5.0|Once I picked up this book, I couldn't put it down. What more can you ask from a book? The story of Ender and the games he is forced to play is fascinating. Earth in the future has been nearly destroyed by hostile aliens, and human beings are in a race to find the perfect general who will save them from the third invasion. Ender is a child genius who is snatched up at the tender age of six and enrolled in an ultra-compeditive military academy where the primary education is through zero-gravity tactical combat. Is he earth's savior?<br />What makes this novel so great is the author's frequent insights into the souls of his characters, and how any philosophy or moral arguments the author might have are presented through action and conflict instead of lengthy dialog (except for a few boring scenes between Ender's bright siblings). Author Orsen Scott Card manages to make Ender convincing as a super genius by writing him as a six year old with adult intelligence (however, this &quot;cheating&quot; will catch up with Card in the next books). The ending is anticlimaxic, and the science is downright laughable - if humans almost got wiped out 60 years ago, why is Earth overpopulated?!? At best this is fantasy writing in a futuristic setting. Still, what sets in my mind is the meat of the book, those fascinating zero-gravity games where Ender matches wits with the best time and time again. Check this book out, it is worth the read.
0767802659|4.0|Okay so maybe this movie shouldn't be taken too seriously, but it's a lot of fun to watch. Based on Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel, director Paul Verhoeven (\\"Basic Instinct\\" and \\"Robocop\\") made this film with tongue planted firmly in cheek...but not at all times. There are bouts of seriousness, but they generally don't last too long. The acting is actually kind of stale by most of the players, especially Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards in the lead roles. The most likable character is played by Jake Busey in a supporting role. Yet with all the cheese that was intentionally added, the movie still works and is very, very entertaining. The special effects, particularly the giant insects, are some of the best that ever made it on to film, and some of the most startling as well. If you have a weak stomach, you may want to skip this one. The epic-style story telling also adds to the mix making this film part \\"Star Wars\\" and part \\"Platoon\\", with the intentional satire of \\"Robocop\\" added in. <br />The DVD edition features some behind-the-scenes footage and a few deleted scenes that are in a special section and not re-edited into the film.
B000001F2H|4.0|4 1/2 Stars<br />This is a thorougly enjoyable blues album that I bought after Lonnie Brooks and Cub Koda recommended it as one of the 25 essential blues albums of all time in their Blues For Dummies book (great intro to blues, btw).  Now I still have a dozen or so of those albums to hear, and while I probably would not put this cd in my top 15 selection, I think it does fit in the top 25.<br />Excellent guitar and blues harp playing and songwriting here.  No particular song has made a standout impression on me, but that's because they are all of an uniform, high quality level.  The only criticism I have is that Mayall's singing, that appears on most of these songs, is pretty weak, thin and undistinguished; however, that may not be that bad of a fault, because it allows the listener to focus more on the guitar, organ and harmonica.<br />If you, like me, have wondered how Clapton still maintains his &quot;legendary guitar god&quot; status in rock and blues, it has to be because most people remember his work on this album, as well as with Cream and Derek and the Dominoes.  It is unfortunate that for the last quarter century Clapton has abandoned any desire to play creative, emotional and hard-edged guitar and instead has devoted himself to writing and promoting AOR suitable for the commercial market.
6305232660|4.0|Since \\"D E E P IMPACT\\" and \\"Armageddon\\" were released at approximately the same time in theaters, moviegoers will most likely always compare the two.  It's apples and oranges though. The title \\"D E E P IMPACT\\" is really a play on words that goes over most people's heads I guess.  Anyone expecting an MTV-like retread of \\"Armageddon\\" will definitely be disappointed.  This is a serious movie that treats it's audience with respect and is NOT just an excuse to make a 2 1/2-hour \\"Aerosmith\\" video like the other movie was.  Also, this movie is the more realistic of the two as well.  When these movies were released, NASA actually chimed in their two cents and commented on how completely accurate the scenario was. They commented on the national lottery system for choosing the survivors that was executed in the film as well as the use of the cavern in the mountains where they would remain until Earth was habitable again, etc.  This movie has all the effects too, but it also affects you as well. The reality is that this type of holocaust happened already with the dinosaurs and is very likely to happen again (fortunately probably not in our lifetime though). But...what if? What would you do if you knew the end was coming and who would you spend that time with?  Would you seek out friends or loved ones that you've been estranged from and make amends?  Would you try to survive somehow?  <br />Being a New Yorker I saw this movie in a theater with many other New Yorkers, and I will always remember the scene where a gargantuan tidal wave hits New York City.  Now the audience sitting in the theater has an aerial view of this scene, watching groups of frantic people on the rooftops of several skyscrapers running from one side of the rooftops to another, trying to avoid the wave.  Then there is a cut to the streets of New York which is now under several hundred feet of water, where we see taxi-cabs and the Statue of Liberty's mangled head floating aimlessly into buildings and each other. At this moment there was ABSOLUTE SILENCE in the Movie Theater.  You could've heard a pin drop.  <br />The DVD edition doesn't really have any fancy extra features other than 2 theatrical trailers, but it doesn't need anything else.  It has a very scary and fact-based premise, outstanding performances by all of the actors involved, and amazing and exhilarating special
0679879269|5.0|Oh my god. This is the best book. Everyone in the entire world has to read it! I cried so hard when I read it. I don't want to give too much away, so all I'll say is that it has many surprising twists and it's a marvoulous love story. Also, the descriptions and details are very vivid. However, I would strongly suggest reading The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife first. But, once you read the entire trilogy, I assure you, you will be happy you did read them.
B000009EAD|5.0|Great!i would simply say that about this album,great guitar works (Jon&amp; larry)also great performed,particulary,vox by mattew I never realize that they play so good music before i listen of I.E i thought that they play as normal stanadrd of florida band who worked with jim morrison,but,thet were muuh more different,they got power emotional feeling in their sound,also good melody either.
B000050HTO|4.0|With this release, Columbia has effectively replaced their three previous Greatest Hits package as a good introduction to Dylan, doing a double disc compilation for one of the most important artists of music.  However, for those who wish to get more indepth with this artists and not delve into the albums proper, go with the Greatest Hits package.  Of course, this should stand only as an introduction.  Do I have qualms with the track listing?  Yes, of course I do.  But the thing is, with an artist of this important, no matter what you choose you only have a limited running time and you're going to have to make cuts.  But why is DOWN IN THE GROOVE represented and EMPIRE BURLESQUE not?  (Yeah, I know, its strange, but EMPIRE BURLESQUE stands as one of my favorite of Dylan's later day records, probably even moreso that the critically praised OH MERCY).  But still, just as The Beatles release 1, this fills the same service: it gets the tracks the casual fan would want and puts them in one place, and it is a good introduction to the most important songwriter we have.<br />The biggest problem I have with this is that THE BOOTLEG SERIES VOL. 1-3 has no representation on this disc, which to me is a travesty, because &quot;Let Me Die in My Footsteps&quot;, &quot;Farewell, Angelina&quot;, &quot;Angelina&quot;, &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;, &quot;Foot of Pride&quot; (one of my favorite Dylan compositions), and &quot;Series of Dreams&quot; are all worth contenders for inclusion, but especially the last three and Farewell.  Even if only one from THE BOOTLEG SERIES had made it I'd be happy, because it contains music that is as important as anything else Dylan has done, and it's a shame that its been neglected by compilers.  Its also illustrates the greatest problem with THE BOOTLEG SERIES in general: it has some of Dylan's best music, some of his most accessible, and it's the type of release that the dedicated seek out.  That's the greatest problem with outtakes, especially with someone as important as Dylan.<br />Led Zeppelin should learn something from this.  If you're going to release a Greatest Hits package, or the Essential tracks, go with the big hits and not ones that don't get a lot of radio play (see my EARLY DAYS/LATER DAYS OF LED ZEPPELIN REVIEWS).  <br />Five stars for doing quite well for giving an introduction, one star docked for not having a song from THE BOOTLEG SERIES VOL. 1-3.
B000000WCA|5.0|In ten years, I'm predicting there will be a feminist revolution the likes of which have never been seen before.<br />And it will be a result of this album.<br />Breaking records of all kind, the Spice Girls have inspired many young ladies to praise the ideals of friendship and sisterhood.  Take these issues to heart girls.  In ten years, you won't need to burn your bras or pinch boys bums.  You will have your own message, and you'll be screaming it loud and clear.<br />The Spice Girls have set a solid platform (and I don't mean shoes) for today's young ladies to build upon.<br />Remember:  God Help the Mista that comes between me and my Sistas!
0316926345|2.0|i got this book thinking it would be geniously acidic and sarcastic like waugh's other novels. i suppose, leaving my preference for waugh's usual style aside, that this book is alright. just. the story was bland, i kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never showed up. the main character constantly left me rolling my eyes at him. actually, everyone in the book did, besides the younger sister. she was a lovely smarta**. but i'm rambling. my point is that if you want something acidic and wickedly funny, go for the loved one or a handful of dust. just admire the gorgeous cover art in the bookstore and then reach for another one of waugh's books.
B000056K04|4.0|The Dave Matthews Band has always been know for it's heavy rhythmic acoustic guitar, so any departure from that is immediatly noticed.  Initial reaction to this album is &quot;Who is this?&quot;, however, once you get past the initial shock of electric lead guitar you'll find it is what you have come to expect from the Dave Matthews Band: a solid performance by what must be the most musically gifted band on the market today.  The band made a last minuet change to proucer Glen Ballard who was influential in every track.  Anyone familiar with previous DMB titles may think this album a bit simplistic compared to their normal complex rhythms, but it is still a good album and shows the band's growing maturity.
B00000JYGX|5.0|I found the music from this CD to be incredible.  It is especially enjoyable for those who speak the french language and are familair with the story of Notre Dame de Paris.  I was highly surprised by some of the negative reviews I found on this page.  For those who feel Esmerelda should have had a more powerful voice for having been a gipsy, I think you had not carefully read the book.  After all, she wasn't truly a gipsy.  And to those who felt the singers sounded as they had &quot;sore throats&quot; again, I think Quoisimodo would not have had the most beautiful voice, considering his deformation and his deftness.  Being a fan of the book, and the French language, I found this musical to be incredibly enjoyable.
B0000027RL|5.0|A strong argument can be made for Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;, but each and every track on Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; is a minor miracle of songwriting and music; taken as a whole, it's a masterpiece that unfortunately comes at the very beginning of Pearl Jam's  musical journey.  Had this been their third or fourth album, it would've seemed logical, but for a debut to be this strong, this well-crafted and essentially *perfect*, made it so much harder for the band to grip success and subsequent efforts.<br />It overshadows later work, unfairly of course, but this speaks to how good this album really is : it's a desert island disc; it's a ten-best-of-all-time on any list; it's ten of the best songs of the 90's collected on one disc by one band; it makes people rave and lose objectivity when writing about the damn thing.<br />How can you not own this album?
B00000634L|5.0|I purchased this cd back in '97 and gave it a few listens and at the time thought what the hell is this.  After I heard they are working on their new album i decieded to give this cd a listen again.  Its amazing!  I really love this cd and am very excited to hear their new stuff.  Their new single &quot;Astounded&quot;......it does not get much better.  R.I.Y.L. Self&quot;Gizmodgery&quot;
B00004U8H4|1.0|This was quite possibly one of the very worst movies I have ever had to sit through. I actually gave up and stopped watching at around the time Christian Bale, the star, began hacking away at somebody to the beat of a Huey Lewis song, &quot;Hip To Be Square.&quot; Mr. Lewis, as I understand it, wasn't very pleased over the movie's use of his music and actually tried taking the filmmakers to court. Can't say that I blame him.<br />     Although based on a popular novel that I will admit I haven't read, the movie just didn't seem to have any real story. Yet, there were people and critics alike who thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Go figure. What I find hard to accept is the fact that Leonardo Dicaprio had long been considered for the role Bale eventually won! I'm glad he turned it down because, frankly, a lousy movie like this would have easily ruined his career.<br />     Rent &quot;Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer&quot; if you really want a chilling film experience. It was shot for half the budget of this one and is far superior.
B000000W5F|5.0|Just want to state, I am only 23yrs old. But it seems this was the album I grew up with. Who can forget all those great videos on MTV in the early 80's from the stones. Anyway this is a great album buy it!!I love the sound of the guitar on the album. Repeat THIS IS NOT THE LAST GREAT STONES ALBUM!!
B0000027G6|5.0|This is a &quot;blinger&quot; of a film score, an Academy Award winning score from an Academy Award winning picture.  Unquestionably, the music singnificantly enhances the emotion of the film.  This is a clear case of a score that is so good, so strong, so well-done, that it can even stand on its own away from the film.  It is a must-have for any serious film music buff.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Hunky Dory is the most pop-influenced of David Bowie's albums, but by no means in a bad way. This was the first David Bowie album I ever bought, and it's the one that got me hooked. Many of my of my all-time favorite Bowie songs are on this CD- Changes, Oh! You Pretty Things, Life on Mars?, Kooks and Andy Warhol. If you are already a Bowie fan and you don't have this CD, what are you waiting for? -- this is definitely one of the essential albums. If you don't have anything by him, Hunky Dory is a great intro CD (after that I'd recommend Low, Space Oddity &amp; The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust). <br />P.S. I urge everyone to go to David Bowie's own creation, davidbowie.com-- you can hear his new (unreleased) songs, see photos of him as a kid, ask him questions, learn about new artists &amp; books, and read &quot;journal&quot; entries and messages from the man himself. Go check it out.
B000001EC1|5.0|This was the one that brought me to my favorite band of all time. Way back when Always came out I heard it on the radio and instantly fell in love with it. The power of that song. Everything comes together in it. David's piano playing, Ticco's power drumming, Richie's brilliant ability to play with such emotion, and Jon's perfect voice that accually makes you believe everything he is saying. So anyhow I got crossroads as my first cd ever and heard all the other songs and realized I had found something very special. Runaway still rocks my world and Wanted gives me goosebumps. There is not one song on it I don't like. Bed of Roses comes very close to being as good as always but ALWAYS remains my favorite song of all time. get this cd because it will so be worth the money.
B00000I41G|4.0|Yes, this is a great cd, esp. the Midnight Blue track.  The solo work on Kenny's Soul Lament is also great.  However, I must reserve my highest rating to his works on the 1969 verve released &quot;Asphalt Canyon Suite&quot; LP.  That LP is INCREDIBLE, and words alone cannot describe how nice it sounds.  Unfortunately, that LP is not released on cd yet :(.  And you will have a difficult time finding it.  I have been looking for that LP for quite a few years, and finally found it second hand on amazon.com auction site (a DJ copy)!  I am a happy man.
B0000047CX|1.0|There is some good music here to be sure but I can't help but feel that the product is badly let down by poor value and packaging. For my part, I am annoyed that consumers are asked to pay for 60+mins of music only to receive 38.42mins. There is a great deal of empty space on sale in this CD.   This re-issuing caper is not new. If a premium price is to be asked, a good strategy (demonstrated by many other examples) is to bundle up the vinyl release with other material as it goes to CD. If Verve/PolyGram are interested in delivering value then they should have got it somewhere closer to the 75min that's possible.  The other problem that I have with this CD is the incredibly poor design of the CD wallet. The booklet provided within has the infuriating habit of slipping out. And why shouldn't it - there is nothing  to hold it in! Were the folk at Verve/PolyGram to design automobiles then occupants could expect to be dumped on the roadside at each and every corner.

0780625129|4.0|It's difficult to gauge my feelings towards this film. It is incredibly powerful, shocking and moving, lasting long in your mind after the end credits have faded to black. The performances are particularly engaging, both Ed Norton and Edward Furlong giving career bests, and Stacy Keach, Elliot \\"Father Gellar\\" Gould, and Beverly \\"Mother Griswald\\" D'Angelo thankfully kept to an absolute minimum. The music, coupled with the bleak cinematography that cuts from black and white to slow motion to grainy textures and bleached colours, makes this a surprisingly emotional film, and the story line grips you throughout. What troubles me, however, is the subject matter, twinned with the charisma given off by Norton's fascist mastermind.<br />The film is obviously sending out the message that it is wrong to be racist, and yet, just as `Falling Down' brought cheers of support from the white middle-classes, `American History X' may gain the same support. The appeal of Norton's character whilst he is in his racist phase is magnetic, to say the least, as the camera adulates him in glorious monochrome and voyeuristic slow motion, and his sociological (and fascist) dialogue is given a solitary forum from which to speak. So, you wait for the abuttal, the turnaround, the moment in which he realises his error, the adulation of an anti-racist, and the same sociological arguments that reverse what has been said before...and yet they never come. Indeed, it seems to make the point that racism is bad because it tears up your white middle-class family, and not because it is wrong. And so, though the ending is powerful and shocking from an emotional drama point-of-view, from a political viewpoint it is dangerous, because it does not reverse the seductive allure of racism that fills up the first half of the movie. Essentially, therefore, the film is full of rhetoric that argues racism has a valid and acceptable root, and is rather slim on evidence that racism is bad.<br />I gave `American History X' four stars because of its power: just a look from the characters can rend your heart. When Norton is in the shower having been released from prison, he thinks back to his innocent childhood, and upon leaving the cubicle, sees himself in the mirror, complete with his Nazi tattoos, and the expression that crosses his face, added to the slow-motion footage and music, is incredibly moving. Likewise, the manic gleam in his eyes having killed the two men being replaced by despair upon realising he is going to be separated from his family strikes the heart. And yet I cannot fully commit to this movie because its surface anti-racist sentiment seems to hide an undercurrent of pro-fascist ideologies and aesthetics, in that never does the camera dwell upon a coloured person the way it does the white cast members. It is, however, a must-see movie, if only for the cinematic masterpiece that comprises the final scenes. Watching it as a drama, it is a great movie. Watching it as something else is deeply unsettling.X' four stars because of its power: just a look from the characters can rend your heart.

068484267X|1.0|What a yawner! Highly recommended to put you to sleep. I was so mad so much of my precious time was put into this book.  I really don't understand what all the hype was about concerning this.  I guess I just must be intellectually challenged.
B000009QPE|5.0|As R.H. Bear of Bile once told me, &quot;Slayer is the best band in the world at what they do.&quot;  He was so right,<br />I purchased &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; in the late 1980s.  &quot;The guys&quot; made fun of the music I liked (too girly).  I was darned if I was going to suffer their chauvinistic prejudice, and I chose this for its brutal cover artwork.  From the opening chords, I was hooked.  <br />As a high school student, I had studied the Holocaust.  &quot;Angel of Death&quot; told a lot more than the books of my previously sheltered existence.  Slayer opened my eyes.<br />And when Tom Araya screams, it's from the gut, from the soul, deep enough to have come from the soles of his boots.<br />There is no better band.  This album is timeless.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is a mandatory CD for any Tool fan. Any of you A Perfect Circle fans who haven't listened to much Tool should buy this one, and Opiate. nema is an excellent CD, truly a classic in its genre.

B00004Y6O4|4.0|Blondes Have More Fun is the album that is easily the most critically reviled of all of Rod Stewart's albums and is a target of alot his fans.  People call it Rod Stewart selling out to disco music and to a degree they're right.  &quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?&quot; is pure disco and in 1979 disco was king.  The song was a number one hit and a platinum seller.  The thing people overlook is that &quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?&quot; is the only disco song on the album and while the rest of it isn't vintage Rod Stewart music, it's not bad.  In fact there are some songs like &quot;The Best Of My Life&quot;, &quot;Ain't Love A Bitch&quot; &amp; &quot;Scarred &amp; Scared&quot; that are high quality.  Also, if you take &quot;Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?&quot; for what it is, it is a catchy piece of music.  If you're looking for Every Picture Tells A Story, you won't find it here, but with Blondes Have More Fun, you get a solid, workman like effort.
B000009QPK|5.0|Arguably the best album ever made by any body. Heavy, fast, agressive... Everything you would expect from Slayer, and it is live. Arraya, King, Henneman and Lombardo show what theyre all about. BUY IT NOW !!!!!!!!!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool's second full AEnima is in my opinion the best album I've ever heard.  I bought this record shortly after it came out but it took almost 3 years before I truelly understood what was going on with it.  Every song on the record from the powerful first single STINKFIST(renamed Track 1 by MTV) to the 13 minute epic THIRD EYE is incredable and you'll find yourself paralyzed for nearly 80 minutes when you listen to it.
B000056N8X|5.0|More awesome then the theatrical release.  LOVED the behind the scenes and other  extras on DVD.
0375707972|3.0|the reader is about a young boys life who grows into a mature man.one day the boy is walking home from school and gets sick.a woman who sees him vomit goes to his aid and helps the kid.she cleans him and bathes him.he visits her another day to thank her and he soon falls in love with and they start meeting everyday for sex.the reader could be labeled a love story as well as a tragic story.its basically about a kid who falls in love with an older woman and a woman who hides a secret.a good read.
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson's History greatest hits album contains some of the finest pop songs recorded in the past twenty years.  Songs like &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Rock With You&quot;, &quot;Man In the Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; and the rest of the songs on disk one are pop classics and lay evidence as to why he is one of the most electrifying performances in music history.  Disk two is made up of original material that strays away from usual positivity that Mr. Jackson exudes.  In the songs we hear an angry and bitter man.  &quot;Childhood&quot; is a scathing account of how the press and fame robbed him of his own youth, &quot;Tabloid Junkie&quot; is another shot at the press and &quot;2 Bad&quot; is anger filed.  &quot;Scream&quot; is a first time duet with his sister Janet that is a good song but falls short of the high expectations.  There are some excellent songs on disk two like the lush and beautiful &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; (which became the first song ever to debut at number one on the Billboard singles chart) and the stirring &quot;Stranger In Moscow&quot;.  If disk two were a single new Michael Jackson album it would be a bit of a disappointment, but coupled with the first disk of his greatest hits, History is a must have.
0141000198|2.0|Helen Fielding is an incredibly gifted writer.  There's no denying that.  But this book is so overhyped it's not even funny.  The storyline of a self-obsessed thirty-something (the book kindly hints that when you're in your thirties you're 'old') searching for a boyfriend and complaining about her weight is so boring, so unoriginal.  Yeah, 130 pounds is terribly overweight, isn't it?  This book makes women look like cry babies with nothing better to do than feel sorry for themselves.  Worse yet, there's a sequel coming.  Oh boy...
B000056K04|5.0|Well, yes it's different...but there is still that underlying tone!!  I love this CD along with all of his others.  It's good to see the band experimenting with new things, isn't that what was the cool thing about the group to begin with...they did things that aren't normally done?  Well, now they have taken it to the next step.  The sax still plays crazy riffs and Carter still rocks out on the drums (maybe not as profound as before, but being a percussionist myself, the grooves he plays are/still amazing!)...So, yes...it may sound different, but the CD grows on you!  I would recommend this CD to anyone that likes DMB....Later all!
0312243022|5.0|Being a reader who appreciates everything from Jane Austen to Pat Conroy to Janet Evanovich, I can still unoquivocally say that this is one of the best, most elegantly written books I've ever read.  Each of his sentences seems to be a novel in itself.  Even with my limited Virginia Woolf experience, I was still able to and understand what was going on in this book.  You don't need to read Mrs. Dalloway in order to appreciate what the author is so expertly doing with his narrative, but it does enrich the experience.  And though the novel deals with many heavy subjects, such as AIDS and suicide, I never felt the weight of them holding the story down.  This book is not to be missed.
B000002B5L|4.0|released in 96,the score is now considered one of the best hip hop albums ever.at the time of release,it was hailed as something fresh from hip hop as well as true to the culture.it worked because it had good hard beats and the lyrics were actually smart.especially those of lauryn hill who became one of the best female rappers.the song that made everyone go out and but this cd was &quot;fu-gee-la&quot; which wasn't the only good song on the album.other great songs are &quot;how many mics&quot;,&quot;ready or not&quot;,&quot;killing me softly with his song&quot; and the fugees rendition of &quot;no woman no cry&quot; which is just as good as the original.an excellent album that launched the solo careers of lauryn hill and wyclef jean.
B00003OT51|5.0|Fore is another great record from the News.  &quot;Stuck With You&quot; is a light and airy song build around a casual guitar riff that has a tropical sound to it.  It became the band's second number one single.  &quot;Hip To Be Square&quot; has a pulsating beat and perfectly plays on the band's average guy persona and spawned a popular catch phrase.  &quot;Doin' It All For My Baby&quot; has gorgeous harmonization by the band and a Stax/Volt sound.  &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; is a solid rocker as is &quot;Forest For The Trees&quot;.  &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; has a soaring melody and was written by Bruce Hornsby.  The song became the second number one single from the album and third and final one of the band's career.  &quot;Naturally&quot; is a wistful acapella number that gives the band a chance to show off their vocal chops. Top notch work and a real winner.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece of fine art.  I love every song.  I cannot seem to understand how it is that there are actually people out there that can find it in themselves to tear down Roger's best work and say that people who like this album are basically idiots with no sense of good music.  A lot of people, including that reviewer I aforementioned, were probably turned off ny the length of the songs.  But this was simply another way that the album thumbed its nose at the recording industry.  After Wish you were here and dark side, PF were being pressured to turn out another radio-friendly album.  Instead Roger put his creative genius to work and presented us with Animals, a work of modern art.

B000003TAL|5.0|From one of the greatest rock bands of the past 20 years.  I don't think there's an 'alternative', 'grunge', or ninties rock band that does not attribute some of their sound to SY.  Simple put - this is in my top ten forever!!
B000008HPE|5.0|After the monstrous success of Sports, Huey Lewis &amp; The News followed it up with the equally catchy and appealing Fore.  The album sticks to the straight ahead, no nonsense approach of their previous efforts and the results are fruitful.  &quot;Stuck With You&quot; is a light and airy song build around a casual guitar riff that has a tropical sound to it.

Fore was their second straight number one album and though it didn't sell as many copies as Sports it did best it in one regard as it produced five top ten singles.  Albums by Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen (7 top ten singles each) and Janet Jackson (6 top ten singles), but Fore holds the record as most top ten singles from an album by a band.
0783229100|5.0|The Sting is one of my favourite films, and I have watched it god knows how many times. This 1973 crime caper flick from director George Roy Hill pairs Robert Redford and Paul Newman as a pair of con artists who pull a con on nasty Irish gangster Doyle Lonnegan(Robert Shaw). The set up is fascinating, as Redford and Newman set up the con, and it finishes with a bang. Along with the super music of Scott Joplin, and a fine supporting cast which includes Ray Walston, Harold Gould and the marvellous Charles Durning(Hudsucker Proxy) and you have a winning formula on your hands. Redford and Newman are good, and Robert Shaw is a great villain. The only criticism of this film that I can think of is that it is perhaps a little overlong. But overall, film making at its best!

B000053GTF|1.0|I expected to see the videos that has not been on VH1 for thousands of times. Besides the new ones, and &quot;Misled&quot; which is great, the others are pretty known and it gets boring to watch and listen over and over for the same old songs. What happened to great videos and not as much viewed  like, &quot;Last plane out&quot; &quot; Immortality&quot;, 'Only one road&quot; &quot;all by Myself&quot; etc...? Hope next one is more original
B000002BVN|3.0|Blood On The Dance Floor is the first remix album in Michael Jackson's career. Usually these albums are a waste of time as the remixes of songs don't normally measure up to their originals. Remixes serve a purpose for the artists as they get additional airplay in dance clubs and on dance stations and that is fine.  If you are out at a club, you're there to dance and the extended versions and thumping beats that are added to songs work. The problem is, the songs get tedious when you're just listening to them. A perfect example on this album is &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; which is a beautiful ballad, but in this version has a club beat.  What saves this album from the rest are the five original songs.  After a spotty effort with the new songs on History, the new material included here is top rate.  The title track is amazing with its vivid lyrics and &quot;Morphine&quot; is a searing rocker that speaks of the ravagings of drug addiction.  The five songs would have been better served being on an EP, but they are worth buying the whole album for.
B000002H33|5.0|As the headline says this is the best album I`ve ever heard. 1 1/2 year back I hardly knew anything about Metallica. I had heard songs like Enter Sandman, Nothing else Matters, The Unforgiven 2 and Memory remains. Then I got to know a Metallica maniac (he hadn`t listen to anything else the last three years).  He said I should listen to the three best albums (after his opinion &quot;Puppets&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Metallica&quot;) I gave it a try. At first I liked &quot;Metallica&quot; as much as &quot;Puppets&quot; because it`s more catchy and overcoming at first with it`s shorther songs comparing to the very long songs at &quot;Puppets&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot;. After a while it was definetly going to be &quot;Puppets&quot; which changed my opinion about Metallica. The album starts with a grat allmost spanish alike acoustic guitar on &quot;Battery&quot; before the beast opens its gap and you can`t sit still when this muscular sound fills the room. A fast and great song. Then the song &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; comes. There are no words that can describe what I feel for this song. It`s long, but doesn`t feel like that because I`m in heaven all the way through the track. With it`s fast and technically great riffs and soulfull vocal by James Hetfield, wonderful solos, exellent drums and very good bass this is the best song ever made by man.I don`t think it`s possible for me to get tired of this song. It`s powerful, muscular and beautiful all at the same time. &quot;The Thing that should not be&quot; is the only little down on this album (it`s a little boring the last two minutes), but though it`s thick, muscular and really great to listen to.&quot;Welcome Home&quot; (Sanitarium) has maybe the most beautiful first minutes of all Metallica songs. It reminds of &quot;Fade to Black&quot; but it`s more grown-up and also a little better. &quot;Disposable heroes&quot; has maybe the best drumplaying of all Metallica songs. The riff after about a half minute is really breathtaking, and &quot;Heroes&quot; is probably the next best track on the album. &quot;Leper Messiah&quot; is also great. &quot;Orion contains the most beautiful bassplaying I`ve heard. This song belongs to basslegend Cliff Burton. &quot;Damage Inc.&quot; has an angstridden opening before it really takes off with hard and fast riffs and drums. The slower break in the middle is just great with one of the best riffs from Metallica. The vocal is also great. It`s really soulful, tortured and beautiful. Every member of Metallica is at their best on this album. Maybe the biggest different on this album comparing to the others is Lars Ulrichs amazing drumming. I can`t understand how he makes it. The riffs are also James Hetfields best and the vocal is with the vocal on &quot;Ride the Lighthning&quot; his best. Kirk Hammet and Cliff Burton are at their best too.The sound is thick, full and deserves a good stereo because it`s filled with details and overwhelming complexity. This album doesn`t stay away from my cd-player for more than a couple of days before I`ve to put it on again. Though this is the cd I`ve listen most to of all my cds I never getting tired of it. If you are a metallfan with brain and you manage to divide the heavy metal that`s art and where every second is made to be the best in the world from stupid noise, this is the album for you. This is a musthave for everyone who knows good music when they hear it. Buy it, you won`t be dissapointed. If you do it`s you there is something wrong with.

My children LOVED that we could have the song lyrics at the bottom of the screen if we wanted - what a neat feature for a movie/DVD.  That added to our enjoyment of a long time favorite.  I have been looking for somewhere that carries this DVD for a month and am THRILLED to have found it here - I can't wait until we get it!  :)  Hope it blesses your families as much as it has mine - a CLEAN, fun film with adorable songs!

0887306667|4.0|I have had the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing for over a year now, and I am always refering to it.  <br />For thoes who are interested in advertising or are already in the business should really read this book.  It is practical advice from experts in the field.  I have read other books by both authors and have found very vaulable information in all of them.<br />I disagree with the negetive previous review. Of course times change and so do values, beliefs, and situations, but the basic advertising, branding ideas stay true. Chrysler would have probably failed if they had not developed brands that created a unique perception in the mind of the consumer. The PT Cruiser, 300M and so on... before all of their cars looked the same...like Chryslers. boring, replications, year after year. That type of line extension would burn a brand out faster than it got started.<br />The one law which I found most interesting is line extension. I would have given this a 5 star review, however I feel that some brands can line extend without damage to the core brand. However this is very limited and must be delt with caution.<br />However, you can see the effect of correct line extention today. In the car market Toyota, Nissan, and Honda all wanted to compete in the high priced car market. They would never get in the mind of the consumer with a $40,000 honda. But they would with a new name, new brand image and new advertising strategy....hence, Acura.<br />Advertising is 90% perception of a brand. Consumers feel what they want to feel, believe what they want to believe, and buy what they think is the better brand.  The job of advertising is to change thoes perceptions in the mind of the consumer.<br />I can go on and on, but it's better if you get the book and read it for yourself.  As you can probably tell, I really enjoyed this book.
630170648X|5.0|I am a great fan of Lubitsch and I discovered him thanks to this absolute masterpiece, when I was 14. The story, the actors, the script are absolutely perfect, clever and funny. If you have to see only ONE old movie in your life (and if you don't want to die stupid), watch it again and again. This movie is far better than all the overrated JULIA ROBERTS's or JIM CARREY's pseudo comedies. My personal list of the greatest comedies of all time is : this LUBITSCH's one, BILLY WILDER's &quot;Some like it hot&quot; and HOWARD HAWKS's&quot;Bringing up baby&quot;.
B000024D4R|5.0|A highly underrated album that was a fantastic follow-up to Wish You Were Here and Dark Side Of The Moon. The songs though few in number are epic in length and full of rich textures and intense musical stylings. The highlight for me is the outrageous guitar work of David Gilmour throughout, as clearly evidenced by his soloing on the track &quot;Dogs&quot;. Rick Wright's keyboard work was also a standout on this album and with Roger Waters inspired lyrics, this is one to not pass up for any reason. Still a favorite 25 years later!

0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, is a science fiction book that takes place a couple hundred years in the future.  It is about a little boy named Ender who is rejected by his family because he is what is called a \\"third\\" or third born.  That makes him an outcast.  Despite his lack of friends, Ender is a genius, and he is sent off to a school in space to learn to become a commander to fight the \\"buggers\\" that tried to invade earth twice in years previously.  He goes through many challenges that the teachers at the school throw at him, and it soon becomes evident to everyone that he is indeed the best of the best.  In the book, Card is trying to explain why people act the way they do.  Throughout the story, Ender is isolated from his family, and grows up in a different atmosphere than his brother and sister.  That causes him to become a completely different person from the people in his family.  At the space school, he is taught that victory, no matter what the costs, is all that matters.  By living in that type of atmosphere, he learns that to be true, and that has great effects on how he acts throughout the book.  The characters are very well defined.  Card uses a third person-narrator that switches between the minds of different people at different times.  The reader is always able to tell what each character is feeling and why.  He or she then knows almost everything about each character that is needed for a storng plot.  This book was written in 1977, so it is a little out-dated.  For instance, there are many references to the Warsaw Pact, which was created by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  Since the Soviet Union fell and the Warsaw Pact no longer exists, it is obvious that this book is a little behind what is happening today.  Other than that, it has an excellent futuristic setting.  The reader is also able to relate to Ender in many ways.  Ender is always the outcast no matter where he is because of his intelligence. When Ender first enters the school, the people he came with leave him isolated because the man in charge of the school was constantly praising him on the flight there.  Rejection, like with Ender, is a very common thing in the world today and the reader always knows how Ender feels when he finds himself in positions where he is looked down upon.  I think that this is an excellent book.  It is easy to read, and once you start reading, it is hard to stop.  This type of book is very captivating and interesting, and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read science fiction.

B00003CXE7|1.0|I must have seen some kind of &quot;director's cut&quot; of Gladiator; that's the only way that I can explain the fact that everyone seems to like, or at least to tolerate, this complete waste of film stock.<br />I've rarely seen a movie with a real budget that was more poorly written.  Every line made me wince.  And the historical inaccuracies are so widespread that it's really not possible to talk in any meaningful sense about this movie being a tale of ancient Rome.<br />You'll probably like it, though -- everyone else seems to.

This book shines a light for all the world to see why exactly hitler is the way he was and why he did what he did.

014028009X|3.0|I am currently slogging my way through &quot;Diary&quot;, waiting for it to be, as promised on the cover, &quot;screamingly funny&quot;. It's just not &quot;v.g.&quot;.  Screamingly boring is more like it. Her little notations about weight, cigarettes smoked and alcohol &quot;units&quot; are really pissing me off. And that's not &quot;v.g.&quot;, either.   It's made it past my 20 page rule,(if the book doesn't grab me by page 20, it goes to the local library's book sale) but only because I'm trying to find any differences between Bridget and Ally McBeal.  While I'm reading it, my brain is moving ahead to my next &quot;read&quot;, thinking anything is better than this over-rated mess.  Haven't seen the movie, but hear IT was over-rated, also. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; it ain't.
B0000033TE|5.0|Leave it to ELP to produce an album that manages to be thier most pompous yet also thier most accomplished and enduring piece of work. &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; could be presented as the perfect parody of 70's prog-rock excess...from the neo-gothic 3-D cover art to the inevitable 20-minute suite of &quot;impressions&quot;. Even the album's title fits the bill-an obscure double entendre for a, well...let's just say, certain popular timekiller involving rock stars and backstage &quot;guests&quot;. The music itself is quite compelling, from the commanding pipe organ that kicks off &quot;Jerusalem&quot; to Greg Lake's mellifluous invitation on side 2  (well,original side 2) to &quot;Step inside,step inside&quot; for the epic &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot;. Another highlight is of course, the perennial fan fave &quot;Still..You Turn Me On&quot;, the trio's most lovely and engimatic ballad (&quot;Love&quot; song? Well, sort of. Discuss.) Rhino's special edition does a nice turn with remastering and the original cover art reproduction. The bonus track interview segment, which seems to run on longer than the album itself, is interesting but not something I would have lobbied for (especially with that annoying Murphy's Law tendency vis a vis &quot;shuffle&quot; mode on your CD player...you know what I'm talking about!) A &quot;must own&quot; for true prog-rockers everywhere.
0790736233|4.0|Imagine if Kubrick's &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was made with late-'90's technology and a Hollywood cast, by -- for better or for worse -- the Spielberg disciple who directed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;.  You don't have to imagine it, because we have the reality of &quot;Contact&quot;.  I had a lot of problems with this movie, some of which I'll list later, but overall I enjoyed it a lot.<br />The science of the movie was fascinating (even though I'm not familiar with the source material, the late Carl Sagan probably deserves much credit here).  A rag-tag group of science misfits picks up a pulse from outer space, and slowly learns the message contained within.  There's a fine moment near the end of this sequence where a video representation of the message is revealed, and it is a truly stunning moment, that carries much drama.  The message contains plans to build a machine, which will send one person to a distant star, presumably for enlightenment.  The &quot;machine&quot; is gloriously realized.  It is both beautiful and believable, its power palpable and awesome (especially in one scene where things go horribly wrong).  Director Robert Zemeckis uses his considerable skill at special effects very wisely here, giving us enough to keep the imagination entertained but never overwhelming the story.<br />Unfortunately, the less technical aspects of the movie are handled quite sloppily.<br />First, the acting.  James Woods and John Hurt, two actors I admire, had a tough time fleshing out their two-dimensional characters.  Woods didn't do anything more than show narrow-mindedness and anger, while Hurt was stuck in eccentric billionaire mode.  Rob Lowe, also playing a two-dimensional character, was just painful to watch, affecting a hoarse voice and a beatific smile that did little to hide the fact that his character was no more than a fluffy device to introduce basic religious arguments.  Ditto Jake Busey, as an over the top zealot who carried the added detriment ofan albino fright wig and &quot;evil&quot; white-eyes.  Tom Skerritt fared better, although he was miscast.  Skerritt is usually fine when playing the saintly father figure; here he's asked to be a slick, egotistical bureaucrat, and doesn't pull it off.  Which brings us to Matthew McConaughey.  I had no problem with his acting, but the character was completely implausible.  A man with a self-help book at number one on the bestseller list would not get this much time with the President, especially if his ideas were as lame as Matt's 'Palmer Joss'.  He represents a bigger problem with the movie, in that the fight between science and religion is handled in a very passionate, but utterly simple-minded way.  I suspect that some of the book's big ideas and arguments were dumbed down for a mass audience.  It's unfortunate, wasting an opportunity for intelligent mass discourse.<br />The lone bright spot in the cast is -- duh -- Jodie Foster.  I admit to being ambivalent about Foster in the past, but here she won me over.  Her Dr. Arroway is meant to have passion, drive, brains, desire, spunk, and innocence.  Foster pulls off all of these traits wonderfully.  There were some moments near the end, when Arroway takes flight (&quot;They should have sent a poet,&quot; she cries when confronted by an ineffable view of space), that in the hands of a lesser actor would be hokey.  Foster gets them all right.<br />I get the impression that Zemeckis himself doesn't trust the weight of the ideas he's putting forth here, because he does several things that distract the audience from them.  First, the relationship between a young Arroway and her father was manipulation of the highest order.  It's pop psychology that anyone can understand on an emotional level, rather than the intellectual level, which should have been the movie's strength.  Also, he employs &quot;testimony&quot; from real-world media figures (it seemed like the entire staff of CNN appeared on screen at one point or another) to lend the ideas credibility.  In fact, the ideas were undermined because of this.  The same can be said for his liberal use of news footage of President Clinton, whose intentionally vague speeches are supposed to relate to the film's narrative, but rather prove distracting.<br />There is a lot of potential in &quot;Contact&quot;.  I was gripped by the story, even though a lot of the times I felt like a machete-wielding explorer hacking my way through a jungle of debris to get to it (I have the sneaking suspicion that Zemeckis realizes this, for he includes a take-off of the line &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume&quot;).  It is visually stunning, engrossing, and, if you can turn off your cynicism for awhile, believable.
B000002OVJ|5.0|In the early spring of 1981, I, at the tender age of 12, discovered The Who.  I remember buying &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; and &quot;Face Dances,&quot; both good albums.  MCA's reissues of the Who's essential works during 1995-98 (&quot;Odds and Sods&quot; was the last of the reissues until the three soundtracks just recently) fleshed out (and in one or two cases, perhaps, padded out) all of these with bonus tracks and outtakes which gave insights into the progressions of some tracks in the studio and of others that were completed but left out, sometimes inexplicably.<br />&quot;Live at Leeds&quot; was the first of these, and in my opinion, the remaster improved immeasurably on what was, in fact, already a good album.  My main complaint with the original was that you could barely hear the audience applauding at the ends of the tracks.  Everything has been adjusted forward here and, as the label proudly announces, &quot;Scratching noises have been removed!&quot;  I particularly liked the inclusion of &quot;Heaven and Hell,&quot; which is one of John Entwistle's best songs, the vast majority of which are highly underrated.<br />All in all, this is most worth having.
B00003CWL6|3.0|The best thing about this film is Kevin Spacey's performance. I was excited to see his transformation from someone emotionally dead to someone who was a force to be reckoned with. I was equally saddened and somewhat shocked to see his tragic end. I don't necessarily agree with the methods he used to achieve his transformation, but all he wanted back was the sort of \\"white picket fence\\" life. He yearned again for a time when things at least seemed simpler. No one heard him! They only bullied him or degraded him! While I can appreciate each actor's incredible ability to capture the essence of their characters, I have to say I was very disturbed to see how terribly dysfunctional everyone was. I suppose in this day and age we've come to expect and even accept things in movies that challenge the norm and question traditional values: lifestyle choices, families torn apart, drug use, etc., and then we hail them as artistic wonders.  It seems to me these characters were played to the extreme. I can only hope that's the case, because if this is what Hollywood thinks goes on in \\"real life\\", it should think again.  There are a lot of \\"traditional\\" people out there with stories to be told that can be equally as affecting and entertaining.
B000000WJK|2.0|If you were to believe most of the reviews here, you would think this CD was commissioned by God himself. One reviewer even goes on to say, \\"I have listened to this CD every day since I purchased it 4 years ago, and if you read through the other reviews, you will see that I am not the only one.\\" Which only makes me wonder: Have these people ever listened to a recording like Miles Davis' \\"Kind Of Blue.\\" Quincy Jones, the great arranger, once said, \\"I play 'Kind of Blue' every day - it's my orange juice.\\" THAT I can understand.<br />So it was based on the rave reviews I read here that I purchased this CD, and folks, I can honestly say it fell far short of my expectations. Of course I should've seen it coming from a mile off. A singer named Richard Ashcroft, in a group called The Verve, with an album titled \\"A Storm In Heaven.\\" It has all the markings of one bloated, pretentious endeavor. This album is slow and tedious, with little or no variation between songs. The lyrics are uninspired and Ashcroft's voice sounds as if he's searching for melodies that just aren't there. The music itself is run-of-the-mill, multi-layered guitar-based compositions that some might be tempted to call \\"lush.\\" <br />There's an old saying: If ten people say you have a tail, sooner or later you have to turn around and take a look. So maybe it's just me. But in my opinion, your money would be better spent on sedatives; you'll get the same effect without feeling cheated.
6304428928|5.0|What can you say about a movie that deals with a subject not usually tackled? Of course, there was 1968's CHARLY, starring Cliff Robertson (Best Actor Oscar-winner) and Claire Bloom, that gave us an in-depth look at &quot;special&quot; people, mostly especially, autistic people.<br />Dustin Hoffman is Raymond Babbitt, the titular character. Tom Cruise, in an excellent role that even impressed me (and I'm not at all a Tom Cruise fan) plays his conniving, selfish brother Charlie Babbitt. Thrown in the mix with them is the beautiful Italian actress Valeria Golino, who plays Cruise's compassionate girlfriend.<br />You have to love this film! Why? Because of two men, Cruise and Best Actor winner Hoffman (winning his second award since 1979's KRAMER VS. KRAMER). They are what pulls us into their world, and keeps us there until the very end when Charlie sadly puts Raymond on a train back to the sanitorium. (I admit, as a man, I cried repeatedly during this scene -- and still do!) It begins with the death of the brothers' father, a rich man who was estranged from Charlie and never even spoken about Raymond. When he dies, Charlie is given a beautiful 1940s convertible (and his father's prize roses). Upon hearing that this brother of his has inherited their father's fortune, Charlie decides to find him and eventually &quot;kidnap&quot; him.<br />His greedy selfishness is obvious from the first scene of the film. Eventually, his girlfriend has enough of this and leaves him alone with his brother. (She eventually comes back to him in Las Vegas.) During their cross-country journey, Charlie realizes how important having a brother is, citing that he always felt alone and that how happy he was to know that Raymond was his brother. Beautiful and human, yet not too sappy and saccharine! Even though Charlie proves to have an alterior motive for Raymond, you can't help but like the character (since he does provide some laughs). Cruise eventually plays the same character in 1996's JERRYMAGUIRE.<br />And, of course, there's Hoffman! Virtually stealing every scene he is in. From his quips: &quot;I'm an excellent driver&quot; to his Abbott &amp; Costello &quot;Who's on First&quot; bit, you can't help but fall in love with this silly, but poignant character. What also clinches the tears for me, other than the departing scene on the train, are the end credits. Yes, that's right, the credits! Here's why. Even notice that Raymond is taking pictures? If you do, then you should know that those are the pictures taken in the end credits. We're actually SEEING what Raymond is seeing; that, in itself, is heartbreaking! Think about that!<br />And to the director, Barry Levinson, who would soon give us 1990's DINER and 1991's Oscar-nominated BUGSY, for showing us that even a family/buddy/road movie like this doesn't have to be an epic to win Best Picture.<br />My hat's off to Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass for creating such a wonderful script! Bravo, gentlemen, you deserve it!<br />RAIN MAN was the winner of 4 Academy Awards in 1988 for: Best Picture - Mark Gordon, producer; Best Director - Barry Levinson; Best Actor - Dustin Hoffman; and Best Original Screenplay - Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow. <br />RUNNING TIME: 2 HOURS, 14 MINUTES.
6305910324|5.0|All the other reviews comment on the fine acting, directing and screenplay of this film. I agree with all of that. All the performances are outstanding and the story compelling. One more thing about this film that is amazing, is the art direction, sound and editing of the chess competition scenes. Most people I tell about this movie think chess is boring to play, let alone watch. The competition scenes are just as thrilling and nail biting as any other well directed sports action movie. The chess pieces seem bigger than life and the sound of the players moving and slamming down the pieces really project the tension and intensity of the game. The quick editing makes the chess games fly. SEE THIS MOVIE!
B00005AUBA|5.0|so you like mogwai? and you're reading a review? why? you already know that they are one of the most original, emotional and talented bands out there at the moment... they won't let you down... You need re-assurance... okay. this album is brilliant. not more of the same, sure, but since when has more of the same been a good thing? mogwai are fiercely creative, and have moved well beyond the bounds of the 'slint lite' tag that has dogged them for so long. The are no other albums out there at the moment to compare to this. 'Take Me Somewhere Nice' '2 Rights Makes 1 Wrong' and 'Secret Pint' are three of the finest songs they've ever written... So c'mon... we haven't got all day. buy the bloody thing. you know it makes sense.
0783227272|3.0|One of the most repulsive opening scenes in recent memory.Even a great director like SPIELBERG can reach a low point sometimes.It's hard to imagine why STEVEN has chosen such a subject among all the projects he enconters.It's like a guy experimenting cocaine for the first time;he doesn't remember where he is or where is coming from.I at least enjoyed ANTHONY HOPKINS'S performance as ADAMS,but those boring courtroom scenes really made me look at my watch more than twice.This is a misfire to say the least.Avoid this film and don't make the mistake of buying it.This is a DVD for masochists only.
B00004TLMC|3.0|This clever but ultimately unsatisfying erotic psychodrama has a couple of high points but for me fell flat most of the way.  It is clearly intended to seem unreal, but also seems contrived in too many places.  The best parts for me are scenes where Kubrick plays on the ambiguities of jealousy in both male and female flavors.  He touches on very uncomfortable realities for both men and women.  Yet he lets go of the tension just when he needs it most.<br />In the pivotal early scene, the wife confesses an intensely erotic adulterous fantasy to her husband.  She reveals a deeply disturbing aspect of female sexuality that her husband understandably never considered, that she can feel utter tenderness and devotion to her mate while having overwhelming erotic fantasies of another man.<br />Possibly we are being treated to the real-life implications of women's mating strategies being a combination of finding reliable resources in a man while seeking out even better genes in another.  Since 10% of babies are estimated to belong to a man other than the spouse, this uncomfortable aspect of female sexuality is probably not just a fantasy of Kubrick's.<br />The husband is obsessed with it for the rest of the movie.  Not just for the obvious reason that it makes him jealous and insecure, but I think it is also arousing to him to think of his wife with another man, and that's where the ambiguities in male sexuality seem to come into play.  The husband seems driven to put himself in sexual situations, even though he never seems to quite carry them through, just as his wife claims to have never carried out her fantasy.<br />The movie does a reasonably good job providing an unreal sense of confusing erotic feelings in the main characters, but is curiously lacking in erotic excitement for the movie viewer.  The sense of fantasy doesn't quite absorb me, the scenes are just contrived enough that I could never quite feel the conflicts or the desires in the characters, except possibly the powerfully erotic scenes where the husband imagines his wife with the naval officer of her fantasies.<br />I think part of where this fell down for me was that the wife is clearly ambivalent in her feelings about her husband, not in having had erotic fantasies of another man, but in not even having a strong sense of committment to her husband.  This destroys some of the erotic tension.  She has an orgy dream  with an odd twist where her husband clearly plays the role of an annoyance rather than a jealous lover while she is taken by countless men.<br />At the climax, where they presumably are recovering from the near-fantasy nature of the rest of the film she reveals that she has a hard time saying &quot;forever&quot; to him; playing on his insecurity about her commitment rather than the sexual jealousy and arousal that seems to obsess him throughout the movie up to that point.  But we already sensed that she was ambivalent about her marriage before that, since her dream of sex with countless men.  The initial palpable tug between her committment and her sexual passion was already broken by then, and she just seems uninterested rather than torn. Perhaps that ironically foreshadowed what happened to Tom and Nicole.sibly the powerfully erotic scenes where the husband imagines his wife with the naval officer of her fantasies.  <br />I think part of where this fell down for me was that the wife is clearly ambivalent in her feelings about her husband, not in having had erotic fantasies of another man, but in not even having a strong sense of committment to her husband.

B000002G89|1.0|Don't get me wrong: 461 OCEAN BOULEVARD is one of the great rock albums of all time, probably on my top ten list. Certainly Clapton's finest solo work (if you count Derek and the Dominoes as a group effort, and it should be). The decision by the record company to delete one of the songs is simply unacceptable, and the deleted song is one of the highlights of the set. Can you imagine ABBEY ROAD without &quot;Here Comes the Sun?&quot; Or BEGGAR'S BANQUET without &quot;Salt of the Earth?&quot; The deletion here is equally as ludicrous. Also, the original arrangement of the songs worked to make 461 an extended work of art, not just a collection of songs. Now it is just a collection. I don't know how to react to this kind of corporate arrogance except to refuse to buy the album, hence the one star rating. Hopefully Atlantic or Polydor or whoever was/is responsible will right the wrong. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.
6300214826|5.0|This was my favorite movie for years. And I still love it. The tiger scene is a  bit off the spine of the narrative, and Brando's improvised lines at the end are a bit muddled. But other than that, it's an almost perfect film. Coppola should get it through his head that his three greatest films (GF I &amp; II and this) were based on brilliant novels. When he tries to create his own material, he falters. When he goes back to brilliant source material, he may knock us out again with a brilliant movie. I hope he will.
0151003084|5.0|...but this book is done in an undeniably British style. It's really truly brilliant. The demises of these 26 toddlers are morbidly hysterical, and the art is truly wonderful. I believe my favorite of the demises was the child who &quot;died of ennui&quot;. (Regretfully, I don't own this and can't remember his name.) This book is great for anyone with a decidedly macabre sense of humor.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This is THE definitive Rainbow record!  After the first album, &quot;Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow&quot; was released, Ritchie Blackmore and Ronnie James Dio chucked Dio's former Elf bandmates and replaced them with Tony Carey on keyboards, Jimmy Bain on bass guitar, and Cozy Powell on drums.  This lineup fit together perfectly, and brought out the true mystical aura of Rainbow better than any of the other lineups.  The front cover couldn't say it any better:  Rainbow is powerful, progressive yet rooted in ancient lore, dark and mystical but also full of light and hope.  If Rainbow's music on &quot;Rising&quot; could be summed up in a picture, then this would be the visual representation of their music.<br />It's amazing; this album only has six songs on it, and totals only about 34 minutes.  But Rainbow's &quot;Rising&quot; is far more than the sum of its parts.  It conjures up such mystery, imagination, and wonder that it goes way beyond its songs to create such a beautiful panorama of images for the mind to enjoy.<br />The album opens with one of the greatest and most memorable keyboard intros in the history of rock and roll, for the powerful song &quot;Tarot Woman.&quot;  When Tony Carey did this back then, he probably didn't know that this would cement him in R'N'R history as one of the most dynamic, three-dimensional keyboard players ever.  But it did, and this keyboard intro is his proudest moment on the album.  When the bass and drums kick in, they pack a wallop similar to a train crashing through a brick wall.  This CD is a sonic boom of epic proportions.<br />&quot;Run With The Wolf&quot; and &quot;Starstruck&quot; also pack a major punch, with Ronnie James Dio's powerful voice seeming to float on top of the music.  It is an instrument all it's own.  Not bad for a former barroom bluesman who got his career started as the founding member of &quot;Ronnie and The Rumblers&quot; way back in the late 50's (I wonder if I can get a collection of their songs, I'd love to hear what Ronnie sounded like back then...imagine that, eh?)<br />Although &quot;Do You Close Your Eyes&quot; is short and fairly disposable (I'm sorry, but it is the only song that just doesn't seem to fit here; I think it would have been better off on the first album, quite frankly), it is followed by what is my favorite song on the album, the magical epic &quot;Stargazer.&quot;  This song never fails to give me chills, especially when I am listening to it in the dark (this is one of those albums that are best heard in the dark).  To me, this really is the centerpiece of the album, as it has Ronnie singing, &quot;I see a rainbow rising!&quot;, and it features such an unbeatable combination of atmospheric keyboards and orchestra, slicing guitar work, and thunderous bass and drums.  This is the progressive side of Heavy Metal at its very best.<br />The album then closes with &quot;Light In The Black,&quot; which begins as a pretty straight-forward rocker, but soon turns out to be an extended showcase of keyboard and guitar solos, courtesy of Carey and Blackmore, respectively.  This is Tony Carey's second proudest moment on the album.  Overall, this is Rainbow's proudest moment-- ever.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Here in Oz, we've been lucky enough to get the Snatch DVD recently. But it's worth the wait.<br />The commentary with Guy Ritchie and Matt Vaughn [the producer] is as erratic as the film. They're never able to stay on topic for long [the producers are giving them sheets listing things to mention], but they do fill the track with plenty of laughs. These guys have got stories.<br />The 'Stealing Stones' feature is like the 'White Rabbit' one from The Matrix. When the diamond comes up, press on it and you'll see a deleted scene entered into the film.<br />The picture disc, photo gallery, talent profiles and production notes are the standard stuff, but the way they're presented makes them far more entertaining than usual [see the little characters besides everyone in the talen profiles].<br />You get a 25 minute 'making of' feature, which I can guarantee will make you laugh. Witness the antics of Bo, the dog, and watch Guy handing out fines to people who stuff up. From watching this you can tell they had a blast making the movie.<br />6 more deleted scene w/ optional commentary. Good stuff, but you can see why it was cut.<br />Storyboard to film comparisons. Normally these are dull, but here they're energetic and off three different views. It actually offers moving shots rather than just stills.<br />The interviews are a little dissapointing, but only a little. It's mostly snippets.<br />Of course there's the trailers and TV spots, and even song samples from the soundtrack. Finally, another behind the scenes feature, equally as good as the other.<br />If you loved this movie, you have to get this DVD. You'll love it.
0783227019|3.0|&quot;Carlito's Way&quot; has THE best party scene I've ever seen in a movie (Sean Penn's oceanfront residence).
1573225517|5.0|Did you ever wonder what was going on inside a man's head? Nick Hornby explains it all in this book.<br />I loved it.  I couldn't put it down. I was laughing and feeling bad about it at the same time. Then I found myself coming up w/my own list of worst break ups and compulation tapes would I put w/those situations. I even found myself staying up late again to watch Cheers so I could get the titles of my favorite episodes. I laughed and laughed and could find myself in the book, too.<br />I knew people who were like the guys in this book and I even had a few people tell me I would never get it because I was a woman and it was a guys book. Absolutley NOT. This is a cross gender book and I'm greatful to a past coworker (female) who handed me the book and said &quot;it's time for you to read this. I can't believe you waited so long.&quot;<br />Hornby has a cult classic.
B00004XOWN|5.0|i love Limp Bizkit, and this album is G R E A T !<br />every1 should have it!<br />really, it's the best.
B00001MXXG|5.0|Ferries Bueller is what every teenager yearns to be: free, independant, quick-witted and spontaneous.  This is every teen's dream.  Cut school and have a blast.  Watching this movie makes me miss high school so much, and it's only been 2 years.  Unfortunately high school life was never like this, but this movie definitely is a blast and has non-stop laughs.  Ferris(Broderick) even gives you some tips on how to fool your parents into thinking you're sick!(kids, pay attention!)  One of my favorite movies, and a must-own for anyone who misses high school or wants to make something special out of it.
B000002H6C|5.0|People will never come to a consensus about this album, which in my opinion is the greatest metal album made since the late 1970's.  Before I review the album, there are two related things I want to touch on. First of all...the production.  Yeah the production of the album is shoddy, but that's the fault of the producers and engineers who mixed the album on a $50,000 system and never took the time to listen to it on a normal stereo.  Second of all, the people who leave reviews saying &quot;I've been a fan of Metallica since the Black album and Fuel and this just isn't Metallica&quot;....i have one thing to say to you. You don't know Metallica and you don't know music. <br />From the opening fade in of Blackened to the ending fury of Dyers Eve, this album is a relentless assualt of nasty Hetfield riffs, mean Hammett solos, skilled drums from Lars and solid supporting bass from Newstead (the few times you can hear the bass. I think the loss of Cliff may have lead people to try to hide the bass sound to avoid a direct comparison of Metallica with and w/out Cliff).  Either way, the power and arrangements of the songs is unbelievable, and the lyrics are the best Hetfield has ever written.  The album deals with real subjects; subjects that people don't like to talk about at parties.<br />If you are bored by this album, think the songs are too long or have no point, or like some other people unbelieveably think that Metallica are not talented musicians, then you are not a metal fan.  This is an album for metal fans.  The songs on the black album are four to five minute simple songs: intro, verse i, chorus, verse 2, chorus, weak solo, chorus, repeat, fade out. If you like that, you're a radio rock fan. Save yourself the money. But also save us the time by not posting unintelligent reviews. Thanks in advance.
0385493622|5.0|Actually I read this book in Italian, but I think that the original can be only better than the translation. It is very interesting, and you will feel the desire to go on and on reading, until you arrive to the end. I also read &quot;The code book&quot; but I think that Fermat's Enigma is the masterpiece of Singh. You don't need a mathematical preparation to read it, although a little of secondary school's math will help you to appreciate this book more.
B00004YKUY|2.0|This could of been good but their new singer Steve Augeri does not have the vocal power to sing these songs and he is a very weak version of the great Steve Perry nuff said.
B00005ATQC|2.0|A very long time to wait for a punchline that Kidman is incapable of delivering. Cruise is a non-starter and it's time for the guy to have some work done on his nose -- sounds like he's breathing through a straw. The only part of the movie that works is the 'big house' section: good music, nudity until it starts to seem like furniture. What was Kubrick thinking? Anyone but the Kidman brothers! Very disappointing last effort.
B0000542D2|3.0|If you really like the Beatles, then you may enjoy this movie.   After seeing this movie, however, you will see why the Beatles made so much more money from music than they did from movies.<br />Ringo Starr simply cannot act.  As you watch this movie, you may begin to wonder if Mr. Starr has some kind of learning disability.  <br />Other than the acting, the music is great.
0553328255|5.0|I won!t spend hours saying how marvelous these stories are, you can read all that in other reviews. All I want to say, is that if you start reading Sherlock Holmes stories, it will become a passion. It will give you a new way of thinking about a lot of things, and it will give yous something to do in your free time. It is also important to say here, that this unabridged edition is written in 19th century British english, and it!s really exciting to actually speak this language, because its special slang is like a landmark of the atmosphere of Victorian England. Also, you will be able to read books from great author (such as Dickens) that you thought you never would be able to understand. Sherlock Holmes is a hobby, a passion and a lifestyle
B00003CXS4|5.0|Guy Ritchie knows his way around a movie camera.  His last film, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, handed us a bunch of guys down on their luck and out a couple of grand.  In this movie we get a group of all-star competitors all on the hunt for a diamond the size of a fist.  Brad Pitt, a bare-knuckled boxer gypsie?  Dennis Farina, a crime boss?  Benicio Del Torro, a crook with a gambling problem?  You better believe it.  And you have to see it to do so.  The editing of the film is exquisite.  Every scene you either laugh histerically or you cringe at the gruesome violence.  You have to own this one.  If you loved Lock, Stock, then you this movie is a MUST own.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I loved the film (any movie that drives out a group of senior citizen viewers 40 minutes into it is GOLDEN to me) but the whole time I could not shake the feeling that it was nothing but the violents bits of Lock,Stock warmed over with a darker storyline and more dumb humor.<br />Lock,Stock was a classic not only for the violence, the quick edits, and the vernacular, but for the intricately plotted storyline that effortlessly interwove a cast of many into one big tapestry that flowed perfectly.  Snatch seemed disjointed, almost as though the interactions were forced there, just to suit a gag later on, or merely to invent some eccentric humorous character.  Nowhere do you get the feeling that this is more than just a funny heist-gone-wrong movie, unlike Lock,Stock which was a very well-thought-out cohesive film.<br />Brad Pitt?  Big deal.  He barely spoke in the entire film.  Yet the theater practically erupted in paroxisms of sympathy laughter when he did.  I'm guessing people were more into the role he played than how he played it.  The movie would have been better without him (though I'm sure his presence helped the box office receipts.)  Dennis Farina (real life ex-cop) is SO genuine as the exasperated American of the caper.  Brick-Top is genuinely scary, and Vinnie Jones gets to play another smooth-talking tough guy.  The rest are either pathetic or forgettable, and that goes for the 2 leads, as well as Benicio Del Toro.<br />Not a wretched cash-in sequel, but definitely not the inspired work of art of Ritchie's first and superior film.  And the critics are right, as much as I liked both films, he's played the &quot;dumb gangster&quot; card twice now, but 3 strikes and you're out, old chap.<br />Bottom line: A violently &quot;in-your-face&quot; yet affable black-comedy missing the soul of the original.
B00003CXSM|3.0|Jennifer Lopez is a famous wedding cordinator who is a little off center in the love section of her life.  Enter the charming Matthew McConaughey, who in turns saves her life from an oncoming trash can when Lopez gets her foot stuck in one of those pesky steam ventalators.  This movie is one of the few decent romantic comedies out there.  It is funny and the actors actually seemed to have a chemistry going on in the movie, this aspect really helped the movie flow.  I would give it a look see.  Think about watching it with someone special.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This movie is a must see!  I have seen this movie twice in the movie theatre and loved every second of it.  Sean C. was great terrific.  Inspirational and chilling to see how life is precious but also an opportunity to shine.  GOT TO SEE TO BELIEVE!
B00003CXMG|3.0|&quot;If you light a candle and listen to Tommy, you'll see your future&quot;.  We hear this line repeated over a breathtaking early scene, closing in on the turntable, panning over writing, pete townshend strumming in the background . . .<br />But then the rest of the movie, instead of being his &quot;future&quot;, turns out to be a boring film diary of goofball antics on the road-- sort of a &quot;Summer School&quot; type movie with much more pretention.  Of course there are a few funny moments-- Billy Crudup on the roof shouting &quot;I am a golden god!&quot;; the deflowering scene is amazing.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance also lends the film a lot of quality and cred (I think he should ask for it back).  But ultimately, we've got this doe-eyed kid who never says a sentence more than three words long, and we're expected to believe he's a wunderkind music journalist.  Furthermore, this movie has all the emotional content of the song &quot;Do you believe in magic?&quot;  Sitting through it was like chewing gum for way, way too long.  <br />Don't tell me I'm taking the movie too seriously.  It took itself seriously, and then couldn't deliver.
B00004YKUY|5.0|This is one of those CDs you can listen to over and over. The more you hear it, the better it gets. Yes, there is a slight change in the sound with the new front man and drummer, but that's not necessarily bad. This CD has a fine mixture of ballads and rockers. Excellent guitar as usual, &quot;on the money&quot; vocals, and great support from the rhythm section. Cain's keyboard work fits in nicely and tastefully. If you like Journey's previous works, you will like this one, maybe better. There seems to be some pent up energy from the wait to release a new album. Very good.
0060194995|5.0|I first read to kill a mockingbird in high school and have re read it a few times over the years. It is an amazingly well crafted novel that sets the context for the story and then lets you be absorbed the characters very human reactions.<br />If you enjoyed the movie, do yourself a favour and read the book!!
B000056VIY|5.0|&quot;J.Lo&quot; marks a return to the music scene with more energetic dance songs that sadly lacked on her debut album. Jennifer's vocals really shine on this album, most likely because she carries more confidence and observes a wider range of music. Among my favorites are the delectable R&amp;B classic &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing,&quot; the Madonna inspired &quot;Play,&quot; the techno flavored &quot;Walking On Sunshine,&quot; the latin inspired &quot;Aint It Funny&quot; and the sensual &quot;Come Over&quot;. This will become an instant classic, this will appeal to all Lopez fans and/or people who enjoy good music, I recommend it!! =)
B000002I25|5.0|Here is one of the great debut albums. The Doors come through here with original, daring, intricate and exhilarating work. The words are clear, poetic and deep. Jim Morrison brings a strange passion to the vocals and Ray Manzarek (organ), Robby Krieger (guitar) and John Densmore (drums) perform unique, intricate music that can sometimes be fun, other times hypnotic. The songs are especially memorable. &quot;Break On Through&quot; is alive and speaks to the revolutionary spirit. And of course, there is &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; a romantic, vibrant song that is a true classic. The masterpiece here though, in my opinion, is &quot;The End.&quot; It is true musical poetry sung and performed in a truly hypnotic form and it is epic, the touch of adding the Oedipus theory into the fabric is original and maybe even brilliant. The rest of the songs are also very cool, especially &quot;Backdoor Man,&quot; which usually calls you back for a second listen. &quot;The Crystal Ship&quot; is also a hypnotic, romantic song with deepness and exquisiteness. &quot;End Of The Night&quot; is, like another Doors song, &quot;Not To Touch The Earth,&quot; wonderfully weird. All in all, &quot;The Doors&quot; is a great album, visceral, alive and vibrant and well-performed. This is rock n' roll at its best.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|When I first bought this album, I thought Jennifer Lopez was trying to make a lame attempt to remake Britney Spears (which by the way is a terrible move). A quick listen to this album, and I fell in love with Jennifer's ability to sing, most likely because she doesn't seem to be like anybody else that is out there in the music world today. On her debut album, Jennifer seems to have an affinity for a multitude of music styles, these include Pop, Ballads, Spanish numbers, and modern R&amp;B. The songs can be very catchy and also very moving simultaneously. My favorites are &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; which has a very infectious beat, but there is annoying person in the back chanting &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah,&quot; &quot;Let's Get Loud&quot; which is a great song to dance to which is inspired by Gloria Estefan, the salsa beat to the song is great but too bad it wasn't played too often on the radio, and &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot; which has to be her best vocal performance ever even if she does seem to be following a pattern of dance musicians that made it huge with a song like this. I believe this album will grow on you, just as has with me, so I definitely recommend it!
014100018X|4.0|I am high school student who read this book for a school project. Being a 16 year old, I loved it. It was interesting and unpredictable. The towns people aren't very accepting of new- commers, but Vianne proved that she was strong. A wonderful woman in a small French town made it seem a little like a fairy tale. It's a very good and appropriate book for all ages!
0345423496|2.0|The Final Odyssey is a big disappointment.  There are no original ideas, but the author treats the ideas like they are his creations.  The characters are not developed at all, and are merely plot devices with names.  Arthur Clarke promotes his underdeveloped religious and philosophical ideas in a way that has nothing to do with the plot.  The ending is the most unrealistic and disappointing part; it leaves the reader wanting more and wondering how the author weaseled his way out of writing an ending.      Read the earlier ones, but to NOT ruin your appreciation of the series by reading 3001.
0060987464|5.0|The first words that come to mind when someone mentions Marilyn Manson are what?  &quot;Deomon&quot;, &quot;AntiChrist&quot;, &quot;Satan&quot;?  Well, there's one word left out:  &quot;human&quot;.  Despite what most religious fanatics that are frightened of diversity and change would have you think, there's no getting around the fact that Marilyn Manson - born Brian Warner - is still a human being.  Subject to the same hardships, burdens, and emotional dilemmas that we all are, as shown in this finely written autobiography, &quot;The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell&quot;.  Within its pages lies the life of who could very well be the most hated man in America, from his childhood, to a little while after the completion of his groundbreaking album &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;.  In the pages between, you'll find the events, the good and the bad, that shape and mold the troubled Brian Warner into one of the world's great inspirational performers, Marilyn Manson.  This book is truly a great example of the hero's (or in Manson's case, anti-hero's) journey, and would probably even make a great movie if there wasn't the utter certainty that it would be boycotted by every self-righteous Christian authority in existence.   Do I recommend this book?  Most definately.
1891252089|5.0|This is the only book one ever needs for Ashtanga Vinyasa Hatha Yoga.  Loads of pictures and comments of specific points of each asana.  Covers 1° and 2° series.  Spiral bound so can be refered to during practice.  David uses the original Sanskrit names for each posture which I sppreciate (being Indian) and also explains the meaning of the Sanskrit.  <br />Above all however, the photos are superb and David's body is so finely tuned that it is very clear to see precisely how the back should be curved etc etc.  In fact considering his age and the great shape he is in, the photos are a constant encouragement to keep at it.  If you buy one yoga book this year, this is the one to get.<br />WARNING:  Despite the quality of the book, Ashtanga Vinyasa Hatha Yoga should only be practiced with a qualified teacher.  It is critical that certain internal locks, flow and strength is developed before attempting some of the postures in this book.  This is NOT a book for beginners of Hatha Yoga or Do It Yourselfers.

I THINK NO ONE LIKES THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT'S NOT BRANDON LEE (WHO WAS AWESOME IN PART ONE) BUT I THINK VINCE PEREZ DID A GOOD JOB. THIS MOVIE HAS  A LOT OF COOL THINGS ABOUT IT, WHEN YOU WATCH THE MOVIE DON'T LOOK AT IT LIKE JUST ANOTHER CROW MOVIE BUT MORE LIKE ANOTHER CROW STORY. THIS MOVIE HAS IT'S  OWN COOL DARK STYLE.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This album keeps getting better every listen.  Powerful, melodic and very addictive.  A cup of coffee and Mutter coming through my PC speakers is more than I need to get going in the morning.  It's also great driving music.<br />I liked this album so much, their previous albums were quickly added to my collection (Herzeleid, Sehnsucht).  Rammstein is a great heavy band that effectively mixes synth and techno sounds.<br />One piece of advice is to get the CD with the extra track - Hallelujah.  It seems that retailers are carrying slightly different versions.  That is one great track.

B00004BZ16|5.0|Named after a political movement in South America, &quot;Sandinista!&quot; is easily the most bizzare album I have ever listened to.  Often times, the Clash's &quot;London Calling&quot; is compared to the Beatles' white album, but I think &quot;Sandinista!&quot; better fits the bill.  Combining nearly everything that is audiable, the Clash created a musical experiment that anyone has yet to come even close to.  Punk, Ska, Reggae, Dance, Hip-Hop, Rockabilly, Disco, Hard Rock, Country, Funk...it's all here!  Not only does it use unusual instruments like violins and various African and South American insrtuments, this album also makes use of sound effects.  The amazing theing is the effects are not annoying!  The Clash is the only band to my knowledge to so effectilvely blend this all together.  This album is truely a gem and quite possibly the Clash's best work.  After all the Clash had accomplished, I have no idea why they aren't a household name; they are more than deserving.  I do not reccomend this as a first Clash album because it is too much to take in if you don't already have a feel for them.  For new fans, go with &quot;London Calling&quot; and come back for &quot;Sandinista!&quot; later.
B000002JS6|5.0|1980 was a year when we lost some true music giants.  John Bonham, the legendary powerhouse drummer of Led Zeppelin, died on Sept. 25, 1980 after an all-day alcohol binge.  John Lennon would be shot and killed three months later on Dec. 8, 1980.  But the first rock tragedy of 1980 happened when AC/DC's original lead singer, Bon Scott, died in Feburary the same way Bonham would die (drink too much alcohol, fall sleep, choke to death).  A lot of people thought that AC/DC would just quit and vanish like thin air.<br />They thought wrong.  The hard rock legends rebounded with raspy-voiced singer Brian Johnson (who sounds eerily similar to Bon Scott) and made an album that stands the test of time.  The result?  BACK IN BLACK, one of the best hard rock records ever made.  What can I say that hasn't been said all ready?  This album is an absolute masterpiece, 42 minutes of raunchy, bone-crushing, three-chord heavy rock that is one of only three albums I have that contain NO bad songs (the other two being Led Zeppelin's first album and the Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;).<br />The reason this album is so brilliant is because of how mind-bogglingly simple it is!  Even though Angus Young is only playing three chords, his guitar solos are so awesome that he sounds like he's doing a lot.  Enough of that.  Let's get to the album.  It begins with the scary &quot;Hell's Bells,&quot; an ominous track that starts with ringing bells as Brian Johnson's menacing voice and Angus Young's guitar riff slides in.  &quot;Shoot To Thrill&quot; is the most energetic tune about violence ever written.  &quot;What Do You Do For Money Honey,&quot; &quot;Given the Dog a Bone,&quot; and &quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You&quot; show AC/DC at their raunchy best, as Brian Johnson's humorous sexual metaphors set the tone.<br />&quot;Back In Black&quot; and &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; are the well known songs off the album (and two of the best rock tracks PERIOD).&quot;Have A Drink On Me&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot; are great as well, but the BEST song on the entire record is &quot;Shake A Leg,&quot; a song that starts with a slow drum groove courtesy of Phil Rudd and then pauses and then leads into a driving, intense guitar riff that never stops until the song is over.  This is an excellent pump-up song and the ultimate headbanger's tune.<br />With powerful guitar riffs, killer bass/drum rhythms, and the catchiest lyrics around, BACK IN BLACK is one of my favorite albums and one of the best rock albums ever recorded.  Hey, it didn't sell 19 million copies and become the sixth best-selling album of all time for nothing!!
6304411448|5.0|Almost, but maybe not quite that far to see this beautiful, quirky movie.   It's Johnny Depp's showcase as the soulful Sam with strong support from Mary Stuart Masterson (Joon-short for Juniper) and Aiden Quinn (Benny).  Sam can barely read or write, but is a savant in the cinematic area, so much so, he doesn't just imitate Buster Keaton, he miraculously becomes Keaton.  The photography is stunning, capturing the perfect town, the perfect park and even a perfect hospital.  An added bonus is the sublime soundtrack featuring the Proclaimers \\"I'm Gonna Be (5,000 Miles),\\" Sam's beguiling song.<br />Before Sam ambled into their lives, Benny was an over-worked, over-protective brother who gave his entire life to hovering over his disturbed younger sister.  Joon precariously threads her way between \\"somewhat strange\\" and outright nuts.  She is smothered, but not strong enough to struggle through the cobwebs.  Sam is the catalyst for both of them.  He falls in love with Joon and implacably, but innocently sets her free.  Sam has a certain ferocious clarity in his view of the world that allows Joon to follow.<br />The hilarious exchange between Benny and Sam is the heart of the movie:<br />Sam:  How sick is she?<br />Benny:  Oh she's plenty sick.<br />Sam:  Oh, because you know, it seems to me that, aside from being a little mentally ill, she's pretty normal.<br />You will enjoy Benny &amp; Joon on many levels.  It will make you smile and laugh out loud, you will be touched in spite of yourself, and definitely feel better for the experience.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Before I saw Gladiator, I had been very interested in historical epics like Braveheart or Ben-Hur. When I sat down and watched this movie with my dad and brother (please don't crucify me for watching it on VHS)I was afraid the script wouldn't be all that great and it may be too bloody. But this film left me awestruck by its power. Its grand sense of dignity, honor and passion, from the great Ridley Scott made for great entertainment. The script by David Franzoni, William Nicholson and John Logan was excellent, using old poetic dialogue to readily convey the proper feelings (By the way, John Logan is writing the script for the next Star Trek movie, so I'm sure it will be great). Other pluses were the beautiful sets and costumes, the great cinematography and special effects, a grand, moving musical score and the fabulous performances of Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, Djimon Honsou, Spencer Treat Clark and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe, whose brilliant performances highlited this film.I was very glad to see the movie win Oscars for Best Picture, Actor (Crowe), Costumes, Sound and Visual Effects, though I would have liked to see it win more. For anyone who likes action, drama, good dialogue, visual splendor and good characterizations, I highly reccomend this film. Strength and honor!
B00001NFCY|5.0|Can we just put an end to the &quot;Creed is a christian rock band&quot; myth already seeing as how Scott Stapp went public and said that they weren't?! This cd should not be bought because of the random religious implications in the lyrics, but because of the fact that it's a phenominal cd! If you buy this cd strictly because you're considering it one step closer to God then you're in trouble. This cd will take you on the roller coaster whirling around inside Scott's head and somehow you won't come off of it ready to vomit. The cd just flows together and is well produced. The first time I heard this cd, I was amazed! I highly recommend this cd for anyone who enjoys good music and not just the religious aspect.
B00004VVNE|5.0|A true classic.  I would rate it as one of the best movies ever made.  First class story and acting.  I enjoy Dr. Stranglelove and highly recommend it but you won't be laughing at the end of this gem.
0684853523|5.0|I've been a fan of Mr. King's work for years (&quot;The Shining&quot; was and still is an all time favorite) so I make it a point to explore every new book as it comes out.  I must say, however, I was skeptical when I began to read this book.  I wasn't sure what to expect from the master of suspense, grisly horror, and plot twists.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Mr. King is an excellent instructor, using examples from such respected authors as White and Strunk, Hemingway, Elmore Leonard, and John Steinbeck.  He also provides the writer with the tools, examples and lessons needed to, not only begin the work, but to finish it as well and challenges each of us to do so. He does so in his own relaxed, humorous, down-to-earth style that keeps you wanting to read page after page and then re-read it in order to commit it to memory.  My copy has highlights, underline, notes in the margins, and is just generally scribbled beyond recognition.  And I've only had it two weeks! Anyone who desires to be a true writer will find this book to be every bit as invaluable as their thesaurus, their dictionary, and their copy of &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;.  If you are not willing to work -- and I do mean work, because, as Mr. King points out, that's what writing really is, don't bother to purchase this book.  He has written many wonderful novels, your money would be better spent reading one of his.
B00000IQBM|4.0|After seeing Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets I found out what a great actor he is so I decided to give The Shining another chance. I decided I really like this movie mostly because of him. My favorite part is when Jack as Jack Torrence mimics and makes fun of his wife after she reads the manuscript with the same sentence repeated and she is scared of him. Shelly Duvall irritates me especially during her crying scenes because she snorts like a pig. What I like about The Shining video version I bought is that before the actual film starts there is a documentary about the making of The Shining filmed by Stanley Kubrick's daughter Vivian. With this documentary you find out a little more about the real Jack Nicholson, but Shelly Duvall still irritates me even when she's just herself. There is a touching moment when Scatman Crothers is interviewed. Since I had seen The Shining before I saw Cuckoo's Nest in the past I didn't realize this was the second time for he and Jack to work together I thought it so neat to see him working with Jack again. My favorite song from the movie was &quot;Midnight With the Stars and You&quot; which was playing in the background in one scene of the movie, at the end, and continuing into the closing credits. If you are a Jack Nicholson fan and even if you're not I recommend this movie.
B00005AFVR|5.0|I'm a 54 year old white guy, with a mortgage.  Well there goes half the readers.  For the rest I just want to comment on Springsteen's latest CD.   Like Dylan, he has become to represent lines of time in people's lives.  When I returned from Vietnam in 1968 and immendiately began working in a southside Chicago steelmill I began latching on to music as a vehicle to relate with other people.  It worked well then.  When I begin listenting to Springsteen and began hearing references of returned Vietnam Vets, (remember &quot;Don't trust the governemnt they'll get you killed&quot;), hanging out with friends and other developmental stages of life, I was hooked on this guys passion and musical craftmanship.  I saw him once in 1975.  How much perfection do listenters now want?  The power of this band is quite evident.  Again like Dylan reworking classic songs, in my opinion, has more to do with keeping their own musical and creative interests alive, than pleasing the auidence.  Becasue the music is so pure and their abilities so sharp, the reworked pieces are very appealing.  &quot;Born in the USA&quot; took my breath away.  I really never listened to the lyrics since the power of the instruments distracted me.  Of course the CD is brillant.  We only can hope that Springsteen can continue to produce material that is just as honest and healthly as what has come before.  All artists are criticized, in Springsteen's case I just prefer to just listen.
B000058983|5.0|I inadvertantly wrote a review for this deluxe re-issue under the banner of the original CD version, so this is my attempt to address the recently released, 7-bonus track edition of this stellar album. I can understand why people wouldn't know or care about Love, but then again they are probably the same people who think Britney Spears is an &quot;artist&quot;. To the uninitiated, it helps to know that Love was Jim Morrison's favorite group; when &quot;Forever Changes&quot; was first issued in 1967, it was their third album for Elektra, who eventually signed The Doors and released that group's incredible debut the same year. If it weren't for Arthur Lee and Love: 1) Elektra would not have gotten into the rock game; 2) The Doors might not have gotten signed to Elektra (Arthur Lee saw the group play The Whisky a Go Go and referred them to Jac Holzman and Ahmet Ertugen); 3) Jimi Hendrix might not have been exposed to a recording studio until much later in life (Lee recorded Hendrix on a rare 45 in the early '60's, and later included sessions with Jimi on subsequent Love LPs); and my life would still be the same. The re-issue offers a little insight into this deliberately mysterious group by supplying fans with outtakes from the original line-up's last session (&quot;You and I and Your Mind Belong Together&quot;), a demo version of one of the tracks (&quot;The Good Humor Man...&quot; re-titled as &quot;Hummingbirds&quot;), alternate mixes of classic Love tracks (&quot;You Set The Scene&quot; and &quot;Alone Again Or&quot;, which emphasizes Brian Maclean's vocals more prominently), and even a song deleted from the original album completely (&quot;Wonder People&quot;), as well as the B-side &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; which is from the same session as &quot;You and I...&quot; Needless to say, the album sounds great, despite the original multi-track tapes being MIA. Lee seems like a prophet when he rattles off lines like &quot;The news of today will be the movies of tomorrow&quot;... Too bad the band went through all the tragic cliches that accompany bands that come close to stardom: infighting, ego trips, money issues, refusals to tour, line-up adds and drops, and the obligatory drug abuse that grew to mythic proportions... Unlike any other album released in 1967, this one shows both sides of the coin that was the Summer Of Love: Hippie pride paired with nihilism, romance with despair, mind-expansion with paranoia. Arthur Lee was onto something, and until he is released from jail in 2005, we may never hear anything this well-written and executed from the man ever again. You can hear in this one album where artists as diverse as The Damned, UFO, The Smiths, Baby Lemonade, Neil Young, The Hooters, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, and even John Frusciante of the Chili Peppers copped some of their best ideas; you can also hear how well Love incorporated their own influences and peers into their songs: you hear Dylan, Neil Young (again), Brian Wilson, The Byrds, mariachi and flamenco music, Memphis Blues, folk, and acid rock peek up here and there, but the overall sound and texture is pure Love.  Take a risk, all you adventurous pop music fans out there who are looking for interesting, elegant melodies to sing along to as you drive around L.A. or wherever it is you may live.
0786915749|5.0|This book by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman is fantasy literature at its best.  Some &quot;fantasy fans&quot; say this book is generic fantasy.(a quest to save the world, unlikely heroes)  But they are utterly obtuse.  This book is more than just fantasy, it helped me realize the evil sides of the world and of people.  In terms of the plot, it exceeds other fantasy trilogies without contest.  My favorite character is the frail human mage Raistlin.  Throughout the whole book, I always waited to see what Raistlin would say and do next.  Also, the other characters:  Tanis, Flint, Sturm, Tasslehoff, Goldmoon, Riverwind, Caramon, Laurana, and Fizban are extremely interesting throughout the whole trilogy.  After reading this masterpeice by Weis and Hickman I was inspired to read all Dragonlance novels.  After reading several other Dragonlance books, I always think of this one being my favorite because it is when you get introduced to all the characters of Krynn.
B00003CWL6|2.0|As always Kevin Spacey does a great job but in my opinion it doesn't deserve an Oscar!<br />Oh yes after you see the movie, you know that such stories usually get Oscars. But no one can understand why! If you analyze the movie deeply you'll see that it has to do with Hollywood stereotype against a specific type of discrimination! This is becoming the &quot;American Beauty&quot; trend since the early 90s!<br />I give one Star for good acting + one Star for a nice way of telling a bad story with a shocking tragical ending... that is all!
B000002BHE|4.0|Celine Dion is one of the, if not, THE, most talented female singer of all time. However, this CD which received the GRAMMY AWARD for best album leaves something to be desired. Some stand-outs are FLY, RIVER DEEP MOUNTAIN HIGH, SEDUCES ME, IT'S ALL COMING BACK (#2), BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME (#1), ALL BY MYSELF (#4). While these songs are excellent, I always feel lost in the middle of this album. Songs that were dissapointing to me were \\"Declaration of Love\\" which is too loud to the ears and is too much like she's screaming, not singing, at the top of her lungs into a microphone. In \\"Dreamin' of You\\" the background sounds are quite a bit annoying, and the lyrics are more spoken then sung. The last dissapointment \\"I Love You\\" has background sounds very very similar to that of \\"Dreamin' of You\\" and moves very slowly. But, even if these songs may be a bit dissapointing, the other songs are so good that you just have to get the album. You should buy the album just for these two, as well as the others mentioned above that are great.great tracks.<br />However, IF YOU ARE A HUGE CELINE FAN YOU WONT WANT THIS BECAUSE IT IS ANOTHER CHEAP CUT-COURTESY OF EPIC RECORDS-THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Two good songs are missing that you can buy on the import version here on Amazon[.com] or elsewhere for a differing price. They are You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman and Your Light. Though Celine does a good rendition of Aretha Franklin's/Carol King's \\"Natural Woman\\", it is not good enough to spend an extra 20.00 on. But \\"Your Light\\" is. Although it starts out odd, with Celine screaming like a rock star, it is a touching, meaningful song, something different for Miss Celine. Even though Celine yells out things like \\"hey man, yo man\\" it is still one of the absolute better ones from this album.<br />All and all, this is a great Celine Dion album and if you ever hear it, I'm sure you'll enjoy it-if not all the songs, definitely a nice handful.
6305657947|4.0|I see this film very similar to the movie &quot;Entrapment&quot; but in a One-Man-Show for Pierce Brosnan. Also this film reminds me of a TV successful Best Seller &quot;If tomorrow comes&quot;.<br />This film combines Pierce Brosnan charm &amp; intelligince with the power and adventures of being a spoiled rich man who simply has everything!<br />I would have rated this film 5 stars but because of Rene Russo I gave it 5 Stars!
0789723107|5.0|This book is excellent.  Every page worth reading - and then reading again.  As someone whose job it is to do usability testing for our company's web site and HTML emails, and do it in little time with even fewer dollars, Steve Krug provides a roadmap to getting the job done.  Steve has become my personal god as regards to usability.
B00003Q43A|4.0|In a way this movie reminds me of another great movie &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Both has the same thrill and suspense not to forget the amazing computer effects.<br />I am not a big fan of Will Smith but I must admit that I see he did a great job... especially for giving a light sense of humor to the movie.<br />Of course this movie wouldn't have been successful without its rich effects. And this DVD wouldn't have been rich without its extras!
0783240503|5.0|At first i thought the movie was corny with the different kinds of music styles put togeather, but then i heard Donny's voice and all I could think was &quot;I have to buy this movie!&quot;  It is now my favorite musical and I can't stop listening to the soundtrack.  This movie is a garunteed hit! (And Joseph looks real good in a loin cloth too!)
B00004Z4WR|2.0|The trailor gives much more credit to the movie than it deserves! And for great actors such as Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie, this movie should have been much better than this!<br />So what makes this movie not as good as it should; 1. Lack of on going action until the last quarter of the movie! 2. Lack of modern expensive fast cars. 3. Lack of cars action except for one classic at the end. 4. The jump of 1967 Shelby GT 500 Mustang was an insult for audience intelligence. 5. Nice story but not well covered!<br />Do not expect too much of this film!
B000059ZLH|5.0|This is a one-off killer effort by the band. The full dramatisation of their latest (1999) release, Scenes From A Memory (SFAM). While this is a concert in essence, it is also a fulfillment of the story set in SFAM. Hence there will be some bit and pieces thrown in with the show that will answer questions raised by the album itself.<br />Mike Portnoy (the band's drummer) has really out done himself in producing this DVD. Ok, it doesn't have 5.1 sound, or widescreen definition. But when you consider that there is 190 mins of recorded material (plus over 20 mins of hidden material) in this DVD, I'm sure one can understand the difficulty in having every single feature available in technology in this disc. But every single idea in presenting the band's talent and showmanship has been thought through and carefully executed. The concert-length Audio Commentary in the DVD is a definate plus (The band &quot;watches&quot; the DVD with you) This explains a lot in terms of concepts and ideas used in the writing of the album. The commentary is both fun and fulfilling to the audience and is an eye opener to those who are fresh to this band's efforts.<br />Dream Theater has lived once again to their true worth by being a fan's band, and sticking to what they believe in. No other band has fans this rabid or feverish about the band's efforts, and not other band has tried so hard and come so close to their fans. This DVD has been 9 yrs in the making, from the very 1st concept of Metropolis Pt 1 in 1992 till 1999 when Metropolis Pt2: Scenes From A Memory was released, and in 2001, this DVD.<br />Now fans of Dream Theater have a DVD with the heart and soul of the band's past efforts built into this release. This is an excellent answer to the band's legacy set from 1992 to date.<br />A Must Buy for all who are fans of the band, and for those who wish to be part of the band's past, present and future. This is THE album, and DVD to get.
630512762X|3.0|If you can accept the exaggeration of the story, both John Travolta, Nicolas Cage did a great job. Plus the actions in this movie are very rich and breath taking.<br />But when combining both the exaggerated story with the super action scenes it will conclude into an unrealistic film. To enjoy this film is to take it as is with no analysis or plot!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I absolutely ate this CD up. It's music for all your moods. Ballads, bubblegum, rockers...it's all there. Whoever you are out there reading this, I can guarantee you that there are at least five songs on '1' that you will like. <br />People have been quibbling over whether or not songs like 'Strawberry Fields', and 'Please Please Me' ought to be on there, as well. But I believe that this CD is primarily for introducing people like me to the great music of the Beatles. I was born a couple of years after John died. Personally, I couldn't even name all four Beatles before I got this CD (I kept leaving out George). I knew only three of the songs on '1' when I got it. Now I know the words to every single song on that album. <br />I've since acquired Abbey Road and the White Album. Really good stuff, you know. However, 1's probably the best one to take along on long trips. If it's good for nothing else, it has wonderful variety. I mean, where else can you get from 'She Loves You' to 'Paperback Writer' to 'Let it Be' with just a few clicks of the NEXT button?
0767803434|4.0|Harrison Ford does a great job in this film. He's so convincing in both emotion and action wise as in his great old movie Indiana Jones!<br />Although we have seen so many films about airplane accidents and hijacking but this one is a Master Piece of all.<br />the suspense is very original and the action is very entertaining... of course you see that US politics plays a major role in HollyWood!
B000002J27|5.0|One of the best disco albums of the 70's. Ok, maybe not. Definitely one of the finer moments of progressive rock. This album was released at a time when stereo equipment was taking a giant leap in quality. Putting the needle to this one for the first time was truly amazing. `Dance on a Volcano' floored anyone with half an interest in progressive rock.
B00004SC3M|5.0|If you look back to the two 007 giants Sean Connery &amp; Pierce Brosnan, both acted similar movies in the same year &quot;Entrapment&quot; &amp; &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;. And both movies and actors were perfect but what makes this movie better than the other is simply Catherine Zeta-Jones! This type of movies requires wild beauty melt into an adventurous spirit, and Catherine Zeta-Jones had both!<br />This movie is very entertaining, and gets you very suspecious all through the continuous surprising events! Enjoy it..!
B0000033TE|5.0|This album is the Tiger Woods of progressive rock. Words can hardly describe the complexity and originality of Brain Salad Surgery.
B0000399WI|4.0|Right from the beginning of the movie you get confused whether to believe or not to believe... but then so many events take place that you ignore your beliefs and sense the thrilling powerful struggle and injustice taking place.<br />The drama is very interesting and amazingly put together that you do not get bored at all but keep on living the changes and frequent ups and downs.<br />Tim Robbins, played a very cold character who managed to well to surprise you all along the movie.<br />Morgan Freeman, played with viewers emotions with his deep character who gave up hope but managed to survive in jail.<br />This is a great movie not to be ignored... to me it's a must see/buy for every library!
6304119046|1.0|this film is of decent quality, but falls far short of such classics as welcome to spring break.  welcome to spring break has a fat man who screams &quot;gators&quot; for no apparent reason.  citizen kane does not.  also, it fails to feature wwf wrestler kane, an inexplicable omission given the title.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Wow! This album is purely amazing! Listen to the song, &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and it will be impossible to doubt Mark Knopfler's genius! Songs like &quot;Les Boys,&quot; are funny and &quot;Solid Rock,&quot; is a masterpiece. &quot;Espresso Love,&quot; is a favorite amongst my family members. This is one of the ten greatest albums of all time. And if you love this, you'll fall in love with &quot;Sultans of Swing,&quot; another Straits album.
B000002U9W|5.0|My favorite Pink Floyd album. Very original and unique and fun to listen to.
B00003CXPC|5.0|Billy Elliot is truly one of the year 2000's best films. It is also one, however, that the Oscars overlooked for Best Picture. Billy Elliot was a pure enjoyment and enlightened film. It's about a boy - Billy Elliot - who dreams of becoming a ballet dancer even though his father and basically everybody else he knows doesn't want him to become a ballet dancer because ballet is not for boys...ballet is for girls.<br />Newcomer Jamie Bell plays the starring role of Billy Elliot, and he performes it very well. Absolutely no flaws with Jamie Bell's performance! And Julie Walters, who plays the strict but fair, ballet teacher, is also excellent. Mrs. Wilkinson is the one who encourages Billy to dance. Julie Walters is just supurb. As well as the rest of the cast.<br />But it's not the actual story that's enchanting...the real enchantment to this film is the choreography, which is absolutely spectacular! This film is very cleaver and original, and even hilarious at some parts. And it gives a good message, too: nothing is impossible no matter how old you are or what gender, race, etc.<br />Billy Elliot is definitely a film not to be missed. You must buy Billy Elliot! A pure delight!
B000002U9W|5.0|My favorite Pink Floyd album. Very original and unique and fun to listen to.
B00004SCX6|5.0|If you are looking for one great album, this is it. Although she is already recording her 3rd album right now, you will have to wait til october to pick it up, so why dont you go buy this one. It's an awesome pop cd. Better than anything anybody has put out before. She changes her style a lot in this cd. in &quot;...Baby one more time&quot; the lyrics were young in the sense that she depended on a guy all of the time, but now she is &quot;stronger&quot; and she has grown and learned the ropes of relationships. This whole album tells a story. Her great/ bluesy/pop-tart voice is stunning. All the tracks are guaranteed hits! Go buy it NOW!
B000059HCM|5.0|even beyond the amazingly wonderful title this is a great movie. It is not for everyone especially people who only like fluff because this is anything but. This a movie about drugs with a great message, great acting and a amazing script. I don't want to rveal anymore but this is really great.I can't express how great that title is too.
B000003CMB|5.0|My great love for &quot;Layla and other assorted love songs&quot; and recognizing Duane's seminal role on that album finally led me to overcome my predjudice against &quot;Southern Rock&quot; and check out the Allman Brothers (whom I identified with &quot;Ramblin' Man&quot;).  I've been listening to nothing but the first four albums for the last two weeks.  That six young guys could embody such genius and passion and power is a complete mystery, especially seen from thirty years later.  Right now I'm listening to Duane's first solo on &quot;You Don't Love Me.&quot;  It's like Coltrane or something.  Only in this context would Dickie Bett's great solo work come off second best.  Honestly, I think this album is on a par with &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; in terms of the power of both solo and ensemble work.  Duane was in a class by himself, but each member of the band was incredibly creative.  The drum solo on &quot;Hot 'Lanta&quot;, the consistent quality of Duane's singing--perfect for the blues--the quality of the song writing.  <br />Went to workout at the gym at the university where I teach and brought along this CD and persuaded the attendant to put in on.  Pretty soon students, used to the rap and metal that is their present diet, started coming up to me and asking me about this amazing music.  It felt great to be able to pass this on to the younger generation.
B000053V12|4.0|this is a ok film it is entertaining and kind of smart it is a twist on the original but if u take into account that Schwarzenegger is in it and the fact that his films are usually terribble this is great maybe his best but besides that it is just another good action film
0767903854|5.0|What a charming work by Bill Bryson! I had thoroughly enjoyed Walk in the Woods, then been utterly disappointed to go back and read Lost Continent. It helps that Bryson is utterly captivated by the land which he describes here. The mean spiritedness that characterizes much of Lost Continent (&amp; from what I have seen of otherr reviews, some of his other work as well) is almost entirely absent here. His description of each corner of the continent, which he traveled quite exhaustively, is at once wide-eyed and humorous. I guess I must agree with the one negative review that I have seen that it is too bad he did not include Tasmania, &amp; that he did not spend any time talking to aboriginal people. But I cannot find it in me to give this thoroughly pleasant, informative, &amp; humorous book anything less than 5 stars.
B00004UB79|3.0|this is the classic case of a movie that is only for fans of the tv show but the sequel is another story
B000056NX5|4.0|This is my all time favorite musical. I think it is a brilliant piece of work that stands up even ,today. I play it often during Lent. <br />  I was excited when I heard there was going to be a new version of JCS videotaped. This version does come across as a bit too theatrical at times. I think Glenn Carter was great as Jesus. I found him to be believable even without a beard. Renee Castle was great as Mary Magadalene. Though, I wasn't too impressed with Jerome Pradon as Judas. I can't pinpoint exactly why. At times, I think his accent distracted me. <br />  I liked the modern touch. I wasn't all impressed with some of the lyric changes.  I'm glad Could We Start Again, Please was included. I like that song. Tony Vincent as Simon was great. Glenn Carter Had some great facial expressions throughout the movie. The Everythings Alright scene was outstanding,especially the part when he says&quot;you'll be Sorry When I'm Gone&quot; and collapses. Talk about synbolic.<br />   The voices and portrayals of Caiphas and Annas were great. Rik Mayal's King Herod didn't do anything for me.<br />   Overall, I would recommend getting this DVD. It's worth it. Just keep an open mind about it.
0783241569|2.0|I don't see what is so great about this movie - I think it's pretty dumb.  Snobby actress &quot;falls in love&quot; with a bookstore owner, treats him like an unwanted dog and he still wants her back.  PLEASE!

0440219078|5.0|i borrowed the Giver from the Library for my almost 12 yr. old son.His taste runs very close to mine: sci-fi, horror, mystery. While I waited for him to finish his current book, I picked up The Giver &amp; never put it down. This is such a great story, essentially about an &quot;awakening of the truth&quot; that a 12 year old boy is faced with. He lives in a controlled community, is happy, it seems, until he discovers the truth about the real world while under the tutelage of an old man he will eventually replace as the &quot;keeper of memories&quot;.  I strongly suggest you read THIS PERFECT DAY, by Ira Levin (Rosemary's Baby). It's an adult book, reminiscent of this story. I read it every 5 years or so...It's also fantastic.  The Giver rocks!
B00000AFDW|5.0|I purchased with album a few months ago and it still seems very fresh.Do not be discouraged by those wrong people who give this album very low reviews cause they do not know what they are talking about.This album ROCKS and so do all of the songs.the songs ''Psycho circus '',and ''raise your glasses'' are really cool.Also ''Journey of 1,000 years''and the rest of the album stuff.Our fav. Demon Gene does 3 lead vocals,4 by the starchild,paul,one by ace-space-Ace,and one by the catman-peter.Purchase this album-trust me it will live up to your expectations.
B00005B58Y|5.0|This CD showcases the newly formed Miles Davis Sextet, which added Cannonball Adderley to the already combustible old quintet of Red Garland, Philly Joe Jones, Paul Chambers, John Coltrane, and Miles.  This CD is absolutely banging-- the sextet shows off its virtuoso form playing Jekyll; it lays the foundations of modal jazz in the title track; and the rousing rendition of Straight, No Chaser is amazing as well.  Coltrane is much improved from his recordings with the first quintet, and the dynamic he forms with the alto sax of cannonball is inspiring-- especially on Jekyll.  You liked Kind of Blue?  You probably did. Then get this album.
B000059ZLH|4.0|I have been a huge fan of Dream Theater for the past 10 years, and was really looking forward to the release of this DVD since I have never seen a video of them or a live concert. Well for the most part I was not disappointed, their musical talents cannot be compared to any other band. I was absolutely amazed at how well they play together. John P. is from another planet, no other guitarist compares, and the same goes to John Myung on bass. Jordan Rudess is a perfect fit for this band, and Mike Portnoy can really hammer the sticks!<br />But putting that aside I was very disheartened by the sound of the DVD. I know that almost everyone else here has complained about that aspect, but it is very noticeable in todays hi-tech world.<br />The Bonus tracks on this DVD simply make it a must purchase. Watching &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; in its entirety was something to behold! (A first for the band to play this live full version according to the DVD specs) So overall it was well worth the 20 bucks spent, just wish the sound was more up to date.
B00005JG6Q|1.0|Akira is somehow one of the most-hyped anime out there.  I saw it a while back, and frankly, I hated it.  It was long and boring with a twisting plot that led nowhere.  The setting was believable, but the plot was not (this coming from someone who likes anime plots).  This movie is also LOOONG. You sit through it for like 2 hours and then you think...&quot;what a waste of time! I could've actually seen a good anime instead!&quot;  My recommendation, rent it first, and if you love it, buy it.
B00004UCA5|4.0|What an album! The Latin tracks (Corcovado, Girl from Ipanema) have a relaxed bossa groove while tracks like You Look Good To Me and Have You Met Miss Jones? swing like mad. This album is less a display of Oscar's technical acrobatics than his beautiful lyrical improvisation. My only reservation is that it verges on being 'cocktail music' and doesn't demand a lot of the listener. But if you're looking for classic Oscar performances of a whole array of standards, this is definitely the one for you.
B000002GVO|5.0|Wish I had a dollar for every time I listened to this one.  It'll get old now and then, but I always come back to the Eagles.  Never stays old for long.  This album's got a little something for everyone.  I just love the guitar solos on the title song.  I love country music, and New Kid In Town is more country than most stuff that's on country radio today.  Life In the Fast Lane and Victim of Love satisfy the rocker in me.  Wasted Time is one of Don Henley's best songs ever.  Pretty Maids and Try are good songs, good enough to be the centerpiece of anybody else's albums.  (&quot;Like a sicle goes around...&quot;).  Too bad it only has 9 songs.
B00003BDXG|2.0|Hamfisted parade of bitter ugliness and pitiful stupidity that deals with two ecentric and rather annoying serial killers that go on a murdering rampage along the highways of texas...or something; with mass media cockroach (Downey Jr.) making them into celebrities. Starts off just fine, but the entire concept and style of the film becomes so repellent and boring that its supposed &quot;satirical&quot; meaning gets flushed right down the toilet, and all were left with is black intensity (which some people actually found fun). Yet, this was one of the most critically acclaimed films of 1994. <BR>The DVD is as good as anyone could hope. Nice picture and sound, informative doco, trailer which isn't actualy the theatrical trailer but the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; trailer and a selection of deleted scenes with an intro by Stone. So if you actually found yourself enjoying this film, you will most likely be satisfied.
B000059ZLH|4.0|I was really looking forward to this DVD. I saw the band on this tour (Atlanta,GA-Tabernacle) and it was a great show.  This DVD contains over 3 and 1/2 hours of video, band commentary on the SFAM part of the show, and a tour photo slide-show.  The video quality is great, and the Pan/Scan presentation is fine with me.  However, I think it would have been a better package if the audio had been mixed in DD 5.1  The DD 2.0 track is not even a good mix...the audio imaging seems to be shifted to the right, and the overall level is way too low. I had to turn my volume contol up to the 12 o'clock position and turn up the sub to get it to sound right. I think my VHS copy of Five Years In A LiveTime had better sound!  Still worth buying if you're a DT fan, but be advised that the audio is a few steps below that of many other concert DVDs released in the last few years.
B000003RCY|5.0|As a Rammstein newbie, I was excellently surprised to hear an album of such a stature as an introduction to the band after being told that they were &quot;nothing more than a joke band&quot; and &quot;what metalheads flock to when Marilyn Manson becomes too tame&quot;. These comments were sickeningly unjust, especially considering that unlike Manson, this band actually had talent within songwriting and music. The songs are all great: The best would have to be the untouchable metal classic &quot;Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen Sehen (Do You Want to See the Bed in Flames?)&quot;, perhaps the greatest Rammstein song ever. Do you want to hear how powerful Rammstein can be musically? The listen to this song. &quot;Seeman&quot; is almost as great, as it shows that the band's music can be just as strong emotionally as it is literally. Another renowned piece is &quot;Du Reichst so Gut&quot; (literally &quot;You Smell so Good&quot;) a tale about a stalker with an incredible chorus and some delightful progressive-rock touches. &quot;Asche zu Asche&quot; is another stellar metal piece, progressive, angry and exceedingly entertaining, as is &quot;Laichzeit&quot; with its killer da-da-dat da-da-dat dut dut dat dut riff. &quot;Das Alte Leid&quot;, a song commonly dismissed as mediocre amongst Rammstein fans, is a highly underrated slow, emotionally charged rocker, one of my favorites. &quot;Wesses Fleisch&quot; is yet another classic, extremely loud and incredibly ranchy, with perhaps the catchiest chorus on the album (yes, even if you don't speak German). &quot;Heirate Mich&quot; is, like &quot;Das Alte Leid&quot;, a criminally overlooked Rammstein piece, similar in style to the latter. This is one of my favorites on the album; everything just flows so well. The sing-along &quot;Herzeleid&quot;, while simple, is another classic and a great metal workout. The two weakest tracks are &quot;Rammstein&quot;, which is good, Zeppelin-esque metal/sludge, but doesn't really match the quality of the rest of the songs, and the melodic &quot;Der Meister&quot;, which is pretty forgettable and simple, though it's got a great chorus. All in all, no matter where one's tastes fall, this is remarkable stuff, and anyone who appreciates music or metal should own this. By the way, I don't quite own &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, &quot;Live from Berlin&quot;, or &quot;Mutter&quot; quite yet, but I am eager to see whether they live up to Herzeleid and will post my comments on them as soon as possible. <br />Guten Tag, fächelt Musik!
B00000FYIL|5.0|The music is simply unforgettable.  Admittingly, I fell asleep during the movie (which isn't a reflection on the movie, but rather on myself, I seem to have a tendency to get too comfortable on my couch at home), but the music just kept re-playing over and over in my head!  I couldn't find the CD and my friend ended up purchasing it as a christmas gift.  My favourite is the very first track.  It's on the repeat function on my hi-fi at home.  Absolutely beautiful.
B00000ILDF|5.0|I recently rented the first 3 installments in the 'Alien' series, and I'd just like to say that had the series ended this way, it would've been a masterpiece. Ripley dying at the end and then her transmission from 50 years earlier (a transmission she made at the end of the first 'Alien' movie) reaching the deserted prison--&quot;with any luck, the network will pick me up...this is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostramo, signing off&quot;--was the most depressing ending I've ever seen in a scifi/horror movie. I really wish the series had ended after Alien 3. This one is great, IMHO.
0440211727|2.0|Certainly Grisham's best novel(excepting possibly A Painted House, which I haven't read yet), this appeals to the indignation we all feel at injustice in the world in general and specifically to that evoked by so much racial injustice in our country's past and by violence perpetrated on children. I am surprised that mystery and legal suspense readers don't recognize the plot, though. My belief is that very few people living today have ever had an original thought (and I seriously doubt that I am one of them). Yet the very striking similarities, the clear-cut parallels, evident when comparing this novel to Paul Travers' 1958 Anatomy of a Murder is uncanny, to say the least. I would be curious to know whether Mr. Grisham ever read that classic (also made into a movie).
B00003CX8I|5.0|Too often are we shown cheap, rushed superhero movies. One only has to mention &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;... ugh... Superhero films are never taken seriously these days. But X-Men shows that there's life in the old dog yet. One of the most popular comics around, X-Men centres around the very adult theme of racism, discrimination, and ofcourse, lots of great super-human powers and a juicy battle between good and evil. The film is a perfect mix of straight-faced storytelling and tongue-in-cheek in-jokes. Those who never take these films seriously will no doubt identify with Hugh Jackman's fabulous Wolverine, who never passes up an oppertunity to point out the stupidity of the situation. But things are carried out seriously and intelligently - hence the casting of first rate actors Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen as the leaders of good and evil. The script is never anything less than excellent, and the direction by Bryan Singer (the genius who gave us the indisputable masterpiece that was the Usual Suspects) is flawless. The supporting cast, made up mainly of unknowns (although sci-fi fans may recognise Ray Part, alias Darth Maul, as Toad) shows a great deal of promise. And the effects... well, probably inspired by the Matrix (a landmark in effects technology), this film looks fantastic. No effect is underdone, no set is not awe-inspiring. The music, alas, is where the movie is let down. Although dramatic and tense, there's just nothing memorable here. Gone are the days of the groovy title theme, by which the audience can identify the film. Never mind - who needs a catchy theme, when you've got a brilliantly directed, perfectly acted, intelligently written film to replace it. And just to make things better, there's sequels on the way. Look no further for the finest comic-book adaptation of the year. Unless Spider-Man's any good... Unmissable.
B000002KKS|5.0|I was about to leave the house for the night as a young college student and I remember getting to the top of the steps to go downstairs and the song &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; came on the local radio station and it stopped me.  I remember sitting on the top step until the song was over -- that last bit of guitar just floats away.  Immediately I went out and bought the album thinking probably I was buying another album for one song but what a surprise it was when almost every song was fantastic!  20 years later I'm still listening to this -- I was up late last night drinking wine and put it on and it's still just as captivating as it was the first time I heard it.  There is something ethereal about some of these songs that resonate right down to my bones.  I've never liked Black Sabbath, anything they've done or what they've stood for.  This album shouldn't even be called a Black Sabbath album, there is a special magic in Dio's voice, lyrics and Iommi's guitar that sets it apart.  It has been a part of my life for 20 years and will probably remain so for the next 20.
B000056NX4|4.0|I was initially skeptical of this new film version of the Weber / Rice classic.  However, after viewing I found the production to be far more compelling than the the 1973 version.  Direction by Gale Edwards and staging updated this broadway classic in a way that is at once classical (as in Greek drama) and modern (allowing it to speak to a younger generation).<br />While there are moments of overacting on both the parts of Glenn Carter (Jesus) and Jerome Pradon (Judas Iscariot) - perhaps appropriate on stage - the intensity and emotion both bring to the material illuminated the complex relationship of these two men far greater than the 1973 version.<br />Also the singing quality of both main leads at times leaves something to be desired and in general are inconsistent.  However, again, both actors have an intensity that propelled this viewer into watching the production 5 times in a row. <br />Renee Castle as Mary Magadeline is compeling and the vocal quality of the actor playing Peter (sorry I don't have his name)was amazing.<br />The staging of the title song brought new insight into this moment in the production, but at the same time it was a little awkward in its execution.<br />While the filmic version of this stage production worked on many levels, it at times seemed to be unskilled. Overall, I think huge credit needs to go to Gale Edwards for her vision in the direction and staging of this production.<br />A fine and compelling cast, while showing imperfections in acting and vocal talent at various points, when pulled together make for a strangly addictive production.  Well worth the purchase for those who love the music and are suckers for stories of ordinary folks caught up in extraordinary circumstances.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed is one of the best rock bands i've seen. Since there are so many rock bands today like Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock, that get lazy writing real music and instead write a few notes hear and there. Most everybody's music sounds like a lot of nothing. But Creed put a stop to a lot of that mess when writing their debut album, &quot;My Own Prison&quot; and releasing their much anticipated second album, &quot;Human Clay.&quot; Without the influence of real music from Metallica, guitarist Mark Tremonti would have nothing but a dusty old guitar and some plain power chords. Tremonti is on of the most idealistic guitarists today and deserves much respect. Creed stands out in the music world and there records are examples why.
B000000H5K|4.0|Presumably Kel Brigance has never heard of Faith No More. Just about every nu metal band are a bad FNM rip-off (inc Korn), however Sepultura are one of the originals - and for good reasons. However, without getting too involved, I'd say Chaos AD, for me, is a stronger album, and showcases more what Sep were all about in those days. I also prefer their new album (Nation) over Roots, coz as a comparison to early Sep, it is a big turn in direction, just as Roots is, but appeals more to me. If that made sense. The great thing about Roots is, it's not all just riffs, shouting and fast drums, no no, it takes many more listens to get into the interesting and dark world the album creates. Certainly a major influence on the scene today, but not one of the biggest.
B00005A1PR|5.0|How does she get such compelling, unique, sophistocated rhythms and depth into her songs with such a light touch? She has a gorgeous voice, something like Randy Crawford plus Tracy Chapman. I love this CD. Lends itself equally well to romantic home music and extactic skate dancing. &quot;Ready for Love&quot; and &quot;Brown Skin&quot; are so beautiful you could weep. I'm looking down the barrel of 50- but my two young nieces also loved this.
B00004SCX6|4.0|If you like pop....you'll like Britney Spears. The music is really good if you like Britney.
B000000993|4.0|...but still good! The reason I took off a star is that some of the songs sound like older Metallica sans the guitar solos. Otherwise, this is a good, solid album. It helps make a transition between the aggressive Opiate, and the experimental AEnima. As usual with Tool, the last songs are the best. The long intro to Flood, and the sceaming vocals and drums in Disgustipated are clear highlights in this album. Other songs like Bottom, Swamp Song, and 4 Degrees are great as well. The only song that isn't at all listenable is Prison Sex. If you heard Sober and want this album because of it, get AEnima or Opiate instead. Most of the songs on Undertow aren't at all like Sober.
B000002VC3|4.0|What else more can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? I find it truly innovative in terms of songwriting and stereophonics. I reccomend listening to it on headphones: the stereo's quite exquisite. Elmer Gantry sings his @$$ off on &quot;Psychobabble&quot;.
630027120X|5.0|The Mission is a very moving film.  It demostrates the choice all people must make; to turn our backs on injustice or to give it our all to make things right.  Forgiveness is also a strong theme in the movie.  The scene in which the Indians forgive Rodrigo is one of the most touching in the entire film. Although the movie takes place in 1750, its message translates into moderm time. The Mission stands as a reminder of the dignity of all human persons and our call to work for justice for everyone.  Everyone should see this film.
B00005A3KS|4.0|if your a bank robbing flick keanu patrick or surfing kind of person you should check this  film out what is the worst that could happen besides laughing at keanu the whole movie also be sure to see if you can spot some one from the red hot chili peppers in this movie
B00004YKSD|3.0|You can forgive historical inaccuracies in a film of this nature ... all in the name of dramatic license and whatnot. But what really rankles is Stone's audio commentary. He says he used the music in chronological order, which is wrong. The timeline of the music jumps all over the place (for instance, the song &quot;Indian Summer&quot; from 1969 is played in the background during the scene when Jim and Pamela first get together, in 1965). He talks about the nightmares of 1968 during a scene when Morrison is in court after Miami, which occurred in 1969. He says Pamela died just a couple months after Morrison died, which is wrong -- she died three years after Morrison died. And near the end of the film, when he's talking about the LA Woman album, he keeps referring to Riders on the Storm as &quot;Killer in the Road.&quot; And he says, &quot;I believe Killer in the Road was on the last album ... it was, as was Roadhouse Blues.&quot; WRONG! And then we figure out that he's not actually talking about Roadhouse Blues ... as the song LA Woman is playing on the soundtrack, he refers to the song as Roadhouse Blues. There are many other such silly, basic inaccuracies in Stone's audio commentary, and I do have a problem with that.
B00005ASOI|5.0|Bottom line is that this is a great horror movie....I've read a lot of the other reviews and the negative ones seem to talk about the violent deaths and not being able to understand what is going on. First of all, it's a horror movie, so ofcourse there are going to be violent deaths (it's not Ghostbusters). As for the plot, I believe (as others have stated) that it is supposed to be dreamlike...but you are able to follow along. The basic plot is this...girl goes to dance academy headed by a coven of witches..now sit back and enjoy.  Enjoy it for its great eye-candy, music, and most of all atmosphere.  Dario Argento is a superb director and I cannot wait for this to finally be released on dvd.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down is one of the most influencial bands in today's metal scene. After the rap metal explosion, they were a major force in bringing metal back to its real form. Songs like Suite-Pee, Soil, and War? show the naturaly heavy side of System, while Suggestions, Peephole, and CUBErt show off their Eastern European flavor. Serj proves himself a great vocalist in Know, DDevil, and Darts, sounding like a cartoon character. The best songs are Spiders, Mind, and Politically Lying, Unholy, Cowadly Killers because they have the ability to take on their own life, and end up emotionally moving you. The only song on here that isn't above and beyond anything else in hardcore metal today is Sugar. <br />Overall, this CD is excellent. If the thought ever crosses your mind to get a Korn CD, get this one instead. It's well worth it. If you liked this, I recommend Violence by Nothingface, Boy Hits Car's self titled, and the Dracula 2000 soundtrack, which has the rare cut &quot;Metro&quot; on it.
B00004RFFU|5.0|This movie was everything I had hoped it would be. It was true to the novel, and it caught all the details that most movies would have missed. Louis is timid, Lestat is rebellious, and New Orleans is just how I imagined it. The cast was excellent: Kirsten Dunst was the perfect sweet/cunning/evil Claudia, and Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise pulled off roles I never imagined they could play. (Thandie Newton has a cameo as a slave -- she was later in M:I2 with Tom Cruise.) Only one thing rang false for me, and that was the casting of Antonio Banderas as Armand.<br />Anyone who has read the novel knows that Armand  a) is seventeen, b) has auburn hair, and c) is Italian. Mr. Banderas is none of these, and his casting was the only detraction from this gloriously evil movie. If you plan to watch *Queen of the Damned* when it comes to theaters, I strongly suggest you watch this one first, and then compare.<br />***Just a note: at the end, the song playing in the car is the Rolling Stones' &quot;Sympathy for the Devil.&quot; Very fitting.***
B000059TEP|4.0|ok if you have never seen this movie get off the the computer and see it     now your probably saying well if it is so good why don't you give it five stars ...... whoopi goldberg she is good in the movie i guess dont care for her much   love the ending though &quot;whose there sam sam sam sam sam sam sam sam sam sam sam ...&quot;
0671004107|4.0|Most readers of science fiction are not interested in character development, or even plot.  They are interested in Big Ideas.  Contact has reasonably good character development and plot, especially coming from a scientist, not a professional sci-fi writer.  But then, that's not what this book is about.  If that's what you seek, read Hemingway, Steinbeck, or Proust.<br />This book is about a Big Idea, and what a doozy it is--it will truly blow your mind.  I first read Contact in high school in the '80s and spent several hours in a daze upon completing it.  I recently re-read it, and had a similar reaction.  The final pages contain the single most impressive Big Idea I've ever encountered in science fiction.<br />After building a so-so story around &quot;meaning&quot; as it is perceived by the religious and the rational, Sagan proceeds to close the book with nothing short of a mathematical proof of the existence of God.  The protagonist, after earlier demanding of religious leaders, &quot;Why would God make himself an article of faith?  Why not reveal himself unequivocably in nature?&quot;, is finally given her proof.  God wasn't hiding, it turns out.  Mankind just wasn't smart enough yet to find Him deep within mathematics.  With Intelligent Design proven, faith and reason are united, and mankind sets off on the next level of development.<br />This is what good sci-fi is all about.<br />Too bad it's fiction.  A fitting final work for Sagan, a scientist who wished desperately to reconcile faith and reason.<br />btw, the movie leaves the whole Big Idea out.  Apparently the producers felt the mathematics would be over the audience's heads.  Pity.
B00003XB8K|5.0|First of all, I think it is essential that I point out that many of the negative reviews I've read seem to be flawed, factually speaking. I think it's ridiculous that some people would give it 1 star just because it doesn't sound like Enya or Prodigy or isn't &quot;newagey&quot; enough for them. Also, there are less male vocals on this album then there were on the previous &quot;Le Roi est mort, Vive le Roi!&quot; album, and the male voices you do hear singing (which is only fronted on 2 of the 11 tracks, and is heavily reverbed and echoey on two others) are primarily done by Andru Donalds - NOT Michael Cretu as many have stated. The rest of the album is filled with lush feminine voices by Sandra Cretu, Elisabeth Houghton (who has replaced Louisa Stanley) and guest vocalist Ruth-Ann (from the amazing electronica act, Olive). Also featured is a stunning and dramatic choir singing parts of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from Carl Orff's 'Carmina Burana' which only Michael Cretu has been givin the rights to use (in the past it has been sampled by others without permission). Despite all this, I feel that &quot;Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; is actually the most instrumental based Enigma album since their debut &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;, and ranks highly up there with it. Strong electronic (but non-techno) rhythms support the music which is moody, unpredictable and is nothing short of an emotional rollercoaster. Although familiar elements and samples from previous Enigma albums are present on this disc, I feel it was done more as a &quot;tribute&quot; to Enigma itself, where each of the past familiar and favorite sounds slip in and out at just the right moments. In spite of this, &quot;Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; still stands as a unique creation even against the previous Enigma albums and has it's own distint feel and atmosphere. Maybe it's not as &quot;newagey&quot; as some hoped it would be, or as &quot;light&quot; and &quot;airy&quot; as some thought it should be which is fine by me as we already have Yanni and Enya for that. Rather this is an album that is rich and complex and that is both deep and thought provoking. If you've heard Enigma in the past and liked it but aren't very famililar with much of the music, you will love this album. If you liked Pure Moods and the Enigma songs from there you will also love this album. If you're a die hard Enigma fan who doesn't mind Enigma progressing with each album you'll love it too. However, if you're a die hard fan who thinks Enigma should still be cranking out the same exact sound and style they did back in 1991 with no progression forward, then you probably won't like this. Nevertheless, I love this album and feel it blows all of it's competiters out of the water as it truly cannot be matched or copied by anyone else. This reinforces my belief the only Enigma can truly compose an &quot;enigmatic&quot; album. This album must be listened to from beginning to end on good headphones or speakers as like always, each track crossfades from one to the next and is a theme centered album that shouldn't be broken apart. Nearly every track is a masterpiece but they sound even better when listened to as a whole.<br />Also, look for the upcoming Enigma &quot;best of&quot; album tenitively called LSD (Love Sensuality Devotion) released near the end of 2001 which will feature a brand new Enigma track!
0671027344|5.0|i bought this book several months ago, put it in my bag to read inbetween classes, but just couldn't make myself do it.  today i finally decided to read it, and i can't even begin to express how happy i am that i did.  this is the best book i have ever read for several reasons.  i was able to relate in so many ways, that it began to scare me.  it brought me back to high school, during a time when making friends seemed almost impossible, and keeping them was even harder. there were times when i laughed, and times when i cried. it made me remember all of the times when i made simple mistakes, and thought that my life was over.  i had no idea when buying this book, that it would in an instant, become a favorite.<br />i highly recommend this book.
B000059TEP|5.0|Ghost originally came out when I was 10 years old.   I missed it in the theatrical run.  But when it came out on video, my older sister rented it and made me watch it.  Even then, I was sucked in and LOVED it.  I rented it again a little bit later and once more, watched it maybe 3 times that weekend.   Years passed, I hadn't seen the movie in it's entirity since then (early 1991) tho I'd seen clips on TBS and the like.  But once I heard it was coming on DVD, I knew it was a must to get.   Well, I watched the movie last night for the first time in literally 10 years and I must say.  It is still a superb movie.  You felt so much emotion the entire time.   <br />Patrick Swayze gave the performance of his career as Sam.  It's a shame his career would never be the same afterwards by taking lackluster after lackluster for the rest of the decade (save To Wong Foo).<br />Demi Moore's career went from semi-popular Brat Pack refugee to a bonafide superstar with this role.   She is not a great actress in the least (for every Ghost and A Few Good Men, she had 4 or 5 Scarlett Letter's and Striptease's),  but she was excellent as Molly.<br />Whoopi Goldberg, what can you say?  Color Purple had already proved the naysayers that she could act.  And next to her part as Celie in Color Purple (still a shame both her, and that movie were snubbed by Oscars), her role as Oda May Brown is definately her signature role.  She steals every single scene she is in.  The bank scene and the nun scene are two of the funniest scenes ever put on celluloid.  She totally deserved her Oscar.<br />Also look for Stephen Root (better known for his role in Newsradio, as well as his part as Milton in Office Space) as the police detective who Demi goes to halfway through it.<br />This movie is a great classic.  And on DVD, you totally will be able to rediscover the movie you loved a decade ago.   This movie, along with Pretty Woman, are my absolute fave movies of 1990, and possibly of the early 90's period.<br />And to those who have never seen the movie before, prepare to bring some kleenex.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|This soundtrack is not upbeat or happy to say the least,though at times it is incredibly beautiful.Some of the pieces are very sinister and intense(&quot;Fear&quot;,&quot;Meltdown&quot;,&quot;Sara Goldfarb has left the building&quot;).Others are delicate and sad(&quot;Summer Overture&quot;,&quot;Ghosts of things to come&quot;).Variations of the same melodies come and go,but I never found it less than riveting.My only critism would be the two conga pieces that seem out of place,but which gives the listener a little breather from the heaviness.I have yet to see the movie,but my good friend Laura and I are counting the days until the May 22 video release.
B000002OZY|5.0|The day after I saw Almost Famous for the first time, I asked my father if he had Tommy and if he did, could I listen to it?  The next day he gave me a copy and later that week I listened to it for the first time with headphones and it blew my mind.  I had just turned fifteen and was starting to get into older rock, but this album threw me forward a few good steps.  <br />Wow!  I can remember when I first heard the french horn on Overture it made me think of some big colorful happy bird that you might expect to see in Yellow Submarine singing.  The album is a jewel.  Songs like Fiddle About and Cousin Kevin aren't as easy to listen too, but when I listen to the entire album from beginning to end I never skip any songs.  Everyone plays great.  Too many skeptics will try to criticize it, but that really isn't too cool.<br />The movie you shouldn't see.  It was a major dissapointment.  There are some things that are just sacred, man.  I don't think you could turn it into a good movie without changing the story.  (which they did, and it still turned out worse than the album).  The only real albums that can compare are Are You Experienced, Sgt. Pepper, Led Zeppelin, or Exile on Mainstreet (at least in my opinion).<br />In conclusion:Buy the album, don't see the movie, and try not to judge too much.  If you just listen to it as music it really does sound better.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|I've actually missed the series on TV and thought I'd check out the DVD. (...)the second I started, I loved it. I've seen the first series and instantly ordered the second (which is inferior but OK) because I admired it that much: a) the characters are amazing - I thought that the actors looked only slighty above average (except Nathan who's gorgeous) but that doesn't matter much because they have a lot of personality and are very likable. And for the matter, more real. b) the storyline is very nice, easy to follow and somewhere between completely conservativ, sopa operish, revolutionary and in your face. c) somehwhere around epoisode 4 (...), the series was one of the best things ever commited to TV. I know that even some gays don't appreciate the gay/drug - connection nor the image that all gay men like 15-year-old boys - but those issues are only hinted at and are done in a British/European way (=very lightly and admirably free of US-conservatism). The main issue is the lives of gay characters in Manchester - and as such, it is just perfect. Watch it, love it, admire it.
0790733226|4.0|I am a huge sci-fi fan and Contact is a movie that I never get tired of. Contact is probably as close to &quot;realistic sci-fi&quot; that there is. No monsters, no gore, none of the usual sci-fi cliche. Some sci-fi fans may find Contact boring and uneventful- I personally find Contact to be extremely exciting and thought provoking. The acting by Jodie Foster, Tom Skerrit, and Matthew McCnaughly is perfection as usual. Contact is a must for a DVD collection. You don't even have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this extremely intelligent and thought provoking movie.
B000056VIY|1.0|Well, I must say that I did buy her first album becuasue I liked waiting for tonight/ and sadly to say that was the only song I really liked.  I did give J LO another chance and I was not dissapointed becuase I didn't set my expectations high.  THis one did have a few more songs that I liked , mostly PLAY. I think that she is a better actress than singer, but the way the songs were enhanced made J Lo's voice sound better, if it werent' for that she wouldn't sound so good, and I probably would say don't waste good money, but with the special effects and some of the upbeat songs, it's no so  bad, Just as long as you don't expect an awesome CD you'll find this one satisfactory, at least to play a few weeks.
B00005B6C9|2.0|These guys deserve every accolade they've received, including induction into the Songwriters' and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but on this CD they pass up a great chance to grow and evolve. I assume they want to continue selling records (otherwise why would they be signed to a major label?) but I can't find much on here that's going to grab radio's attention. And without a radio hit, it's going to be very hard to sell albums.<br />From a group that became famous through its ballads, it's sad to hear them perform such bland, sacchariney love songs as &quot;Sacred Trust,&quot; &quot;Wedding Day,&quot; and &quot;The Extra Mile,&quot; the latter song unimaginatively borrowing some notes from &quot;How Can I Be Sure.&quot; A different producer could have given &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; a more modern touch, but the other two songs can't overcome their cliched musical and lyrical ideas. &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; sounds a little like U2's &quot;Last Night On Earth&quot; and is the only track that retains the old Bee Gees magic from beginning to end.<br />The most surprising aspect of this album was the fact that each brother got to record two solo tracks. Robin outshines his brothers by simply turning in a couple of breezy, pleasant adult contemporary tunes, &quot;Déjà vu&quot; and &quot;Embrace.&quot; Barry chooses to indulge himself with the I-don't-get-hard-rock-but-will-try-it-anyway mess &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot; and &quot;Technicolor Dreams,&quot; whose existence the Beatles made unnecessary 30-some years ago when they recorded &quot;When I'm 64.&quot; Maurice, not exactly anyone's idea of a lead singer, amiably contributes &quot;Man In The Middle,&quot; which might as well be &quot;Omega Man II,&quot; and &quot;Walking On Air,&quot; also henceforth known as &quot;Wildflower II.&quot; What the Bee Gees need is to team up with some musical collaborators who have new ideas and can shake them out of their insular, lite-rock haze, just as Arif Mardin did with &quot;Main Course.&quot;
0060930187|5.0|This book has been frequently labeled as one of the first salinger like books with a woman as the main character.  However, that label is a huge insult to the Bell Jar and Sylvia Plath who has ten times the skill of salinger and her book is ten times more real and more intresting.  Despite the differences, this book shares one fault with salingers in that both rely  heavily on a main character, Holden and in Plath, Esther. So if you find your self hating Esther, than you probably won't like any of the book.  That said, Plath makes Esther much more appealing and likeable than holden, most likely because the character is more genuine than Holden Caufield.  The story itself gave me the chills at the end, which is ironic, though it was not intended to be so and that is what gets you while you read the book: The fact that she worked so hard battling depression only to fall back under the bell jar shortly after the book was published.  However, as one reviewer earlier suggested, this book is more than a descent into madness, it also makes social commentary on the role of woman and the suburban life, i can't find that review now but it was really excellent you should look through and find it.
0553274503|5.0|Flowers For Algernon is about an individual who is faced with the burdens of mental retardation. Keyes uses people, feelings, places, past events, etc. in order to get this book across. In my opinion, this is a must read novel. Very Compelling!
B00004XOWN|5.0|Although I like to think I enjoy real music and don't fall for pseudo-angry punk skater-bands this is a whole other story. With `The Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water' Fred Durst shows us he really can sing, he really can write good music and his band really are excellent musicians.  Brilliant tracks on the album include the singles `My Way', `Rollin', `My Generation' and `Take A Look Around', the `Mission Impossible'-theme. These songs showcase pure rock - the very loud kind. Rap and hip-hop are represented by the urban version of `Rollin' and by `Getcha Groove On' with the featuring stylings of pure talents like DMX, Wutang's Method Man, Redman and the one and only Mister X to the Z Xzibit. `Hold On' and `The One' are two real emotional moments, proving Mister Durst has a soul - and a sensitive one. <br />I believe today's poets try to get their messages across by shocking others (so do Eminem, Dr. Dre, Fred and so many others) but in the end it's the music and the lyrics that matter. These are the medieval troubadours of our own time... and we're lucky to have `em. I think it's 2Pac who said a rose can grow from concrete. This is an incredible album, to put it in a single word: it's strong.
B000002ULO|5.0|What a stunning comeback musically this album was to Sir Paul. The unfortunate thing was that it didn't chart well. With the possible exception of Band On The Run, this I feel is Paul's finest solo effort to date. In many of the cuts it brings out the gift in him that we all admire and that is melody. From the simplistic beauty of Little Willow (his ode to Ringo's deceased wife Maureen), to the absolutely joyful Heaven On A Sunday, we are constantly reminded of the wonder that is McCartney. Few artists can touch us in the heart the way he can. He has a tendency to go through droughts; and just when you feel he is done he blows us away with something as gorgeous as this. Now if we could just get people to rediscover him and put him back on the charts. Get this wonderful cd, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!!
1552091090|4.0|The mother of a friend gave me this book when my first of three sons was born.  She wrote in the cover that the all mothers of boys should have a copy of this. I find it to hit home as my son's are &quot;busy&quot; and yet I do love them so much.  I would cry a little when I read it.  With three boys in the house, I can attest at least to the early stages illustrated here.  It's a good baby gift to new mothers with little boys.
0767827015|5.0|Such a film is a masterpiece of realism and cynicism because realism is always cynical in front of evil, because that sadism here aims at showing the horror of black ghettos or urban projects in Los Angeles. It illustrates the fact that the vast majority of black murderers kill black victims. It is in fact the same thing as for white murderers and white victims. Who is the copy cat? Or is it a rule that you murder one of your own? In other words crime is not racist, not even racial, in its vast majority. It is nothing but the result of a social, cultural, ideological, economic and political situation that nurtures it. But the film provides absolutely no answer about that social situation. Cynical black cops who can only repress, even the innocent, when they do something at all, especially when that innocent is black, though most of the time these cops do nothing as for protecting the black community against the crime it feeds and raises in its own heart like a pet in a home. There is no hope except escape, go away as far as possible to free ourselves from the white plot that locks blacks together to produce a self-destructive boiling pot of a community, not even seeing it may be a time bomb that could harm the whole society when it explodes. It only wants to impress the audience with a fate, a fatality and create in its audience a feeling, emotion of total rejection based on disgust, maybe even hatred. But there is no hope anywhere in that film. No hope whatsoever.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
B000002KFJ|5.0|Another great Black Sabbath CD.  Not a bad song on the CD.  One of my all time favorites.  Go out and buy it.
B000024D4R|5.0|Don't you think that it is very stupid to say that a song is bad because it is long? Or because it is short? The quality of music does not depend on such parameters. If you are searching for 3 and a half poppy songs don't buy this album, it's not for you. This album is to be listend to, and to think about it, not just chew it and spit it. Listen to Gilmour's guitar and notice his influence in another great ones, like The Edge and Slash!
B000002LR6|5.0|This is the second best Ministry album out there. If you have never heard Ministry this is a perfect starting point. Far more experimental than the punky THE MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO TASTE and just a tad harder than THE LAND OF RAPE AND HONEY, this is a headbanger's paradise, not to mention a true industrial classic. Check out NWO, TV II, and HERO.
B000059XUP|4.0|I FOUND THIS MOVIE TO BE VERY GOOD &amp; THE MUSIC IS GREAT. IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS PART ONE, I THINK  PART ONE WAS GREAT, BUT I ENJOYED THIS ONE A LOT. I THINK NO ONE LIKES THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT'S NOT BRANDON LEE (WHO WAS AWESOME IN PART ONE) BUT I THINK VINCE PEREZ DID A GOOD JOB. THIS MOVIE HAS  A LOT OF COOL THINGS ABOUT IT, WHEN YOU WATCH THE MOVIE DON'T LOOK AT IT LIKE THE CROW 2, BUT MORE LIKE ANOTHER CROW STORY. THIS MOVIE HAS IT'S  OWN COOL DARK STYLE.
B00005AUBA|5.0|it is refreshing to see mogwai moving on from come on die young, without forgetting the things that made them great in the first place.<br />without doubt, there are some songs here which rank as mogwai &quot;classics&quot; along with the likes of tracy and stanley kubrick. there are various returns to &quot;with portfolio&quot; type noise, with the songs &quot;sine wave&quot; and &quot;chant&quot;, although the former is awash with beautiful melodies.<br />songs like &quot;take me somewhere nice&quot; and &quot;dial:revenge&quot; are reminiscent of the splendour of the stanley kubrick e.p., and also have vocals. the more harsher arpeggio's are evident on &quot;you don't know jesus&quot;, which sets it apart from most of this record.<br />the best thing about this record is it's cohesion. this album feels more like an album than anything mogwai have attempted before, and i think they were conscious of this. it has a cohesive mood in a simalar vein to radiohead's kid a or tortoise's excellent &quot;standards&quot; album. however, this lp is a lot more warm and emotional than those albums.<br />mogwai are back.
B0000024SD|5.0|I bought Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde (the three considered to be his best) and this album at the same time.  I listened to all four all the way through and this is the one I returned to and have left in my cd player.  No other Dylan album can match its diversity.  &quot;It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is the most underrated Dylan song and in my opinion his best.  Add the casual Dylan fan's favorite, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; and other classics such as &quot;Subterrainian Homesick Blues,&quot; and &quot;Maggie's Farm,&quot; and you have a great album.  Not to mention that there is not one bad song.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|The name says it all. It's an album called 'the best of Jimi Hendrix'. Surely that's reason enough to buy it. If you're still not convinced then one listen will do it. He really is a genuis when it comes to playing the guitar. Songs like 'voodoo chile' and 'all along the watchtower' show, in my view, some of the best improvisation. You gotta get this album, it'll leave you stunned (and experienced!).
B00004XOWM|2.0|When I bought Limp Bizkit's first release, 3 Dollar Bill Ya'll I was amazed by their origionality. So of course when they put out Significant other I rushed to the store and bought it. This CD was pretty repetative and the first single, Nookie, was very idiodic but none the less I was still glad I bought it. When I listened to Chocolate Starfish I felt so angry at the stupidity of the album. Every track sounded like one before it. You would like to think frontman Fred Durst is trying to show off how many foul words he knows. I did however like the M:I2 theme song. The bottom line is you should stay away from this CD unless you like a lot of childish lyrics and swearing. Limp Bizkit is just another sell out band that'll die out sooner or later.
6304994540|5.0|If I could give this movie more than 5 stars, I would. It is worth every star I could give. This movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The acting was all amazing, especially John Goodman. He was hilarious in his role as Walter, the Vietnam vet. I have seen this movie multiple times now and it just gets better every time. There are scenes where I laugh so hard I'm close to tears. It's so much differentthan all the other comedies that come out. It really is a great change of pace. If you don't get at least a few laughs out of this movie you don't have any sense of humor. Watch it, and watch it often!
B00005AKQE|5.0|Welcome to the big time. Creed is one of the fastest, and most popular, rising bands. From their beautiful guitar rythyms and well developed lyrics, Creed has proven their worth. This is a band that will be around for some time to come. Keep it up Scott and Mark!!
B000008H1U|5.0|If you know nothing about Jethro Tull this should be the first album you try. It has a slightly more commercial and lighter feel to it than other Tull albums. If upon listening to this album you feel that you like Tull then you could start buying their other stuff. I love Tull and feel that Ian is very talented, but sometimes (like Emerson, Lake, and Palmer and Led Zepplin) his songs can become too long and overly dramatic. That's why this is a good place to start. This is a straight forward rock album and it is consistantly good from start to finish.
B00005AFVR|5.0|What else can I say?  Bruce and the E Street Band are simply THE BEST live act around...no frills, no gimmicks, just great and meaningful music!  I was fortunate to see them in Virginia Beach in 1973 when they were doing the big club circuit.  This offering captures exactly what I remember way back then.  Bruce is the most important American artist since Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix.  What is so great is that even the so-called throw away tunes are dynamic and moving.  I am not even going to attempt a song-by-song commentary, as that would only be a waste of time.  Just trust me on this one...This is one of the best performances in our lifetime!
B000001FFJ|4.0|Maybe it means I'm not a good fan of Tom Waits, but I prefer his love songs and lost-love songs to his grating jazz experiments.<br />To me, the best things on this album are &quot;Hang Down Your Head,&quot; &quot;Downtown Train,&quot; (later trashed by Rod Stewart), and &quot;Blind Love,&quot; a great country drinking song helped out by Keith Richards backing vocals.<br />Some of the other stuff is good too--&quot;Singapore&quot; and &quot;Jockey Full Of Bourbon,&quot; for example--but if I never have to hear &quot;Tango Till They're Sore&quot; again, it'll be too soon for me.
B000003N7G|5.0|I just recently started listening to some jazz.  I read a lot of the reviews here and thought I'd give this album a try.  Needless to say, this album is trully a special gift to all who enjoy good music. The story behind the album only makes it that more special.  Everyone should have this album even if your not really into jazz.  Don't put it on as background music.  Put it in your cd player, sit down for 40 minutes and really listen to it. As time went on, I found myself being drawn to this album.  You will too...Give it a try!
B00000JJQK|5.0|I am not a Beach Boys fan.  <br />I consider this one of the 4 or 5 greatest albums of all time.<br />The trouble with this album is that it constantly points out the musical genius--and I do mean genius--Brian Wilson was, and leaves you wondering how he could have plummeted to the depths that would hit him within just a few months of PET SOUNDS.<br />As much as I love &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;Sloop John B,&quot; they seem second tier when heard in the context of this album.  &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day,&quot; &quot;Here Today,&quot; &quot;God Only Knows,&quot; and &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; are all first rate Pop.  <br />PET SOUNDS also has what I consider to be the greatest Beach Boys track, &quot;Caroline No.&quot;  It is a perfect recording of a heartbreaking lyric.
B000056V73|5.0|Every time they do a writer story I get all choked up.  This is like Shakespeare in Love only different.  Like Shakespeare in Love?  WHAT?  Well, we have a writer as the hero.  And...?  And he's in love.  And...?  Okay the rest is different except that he's really working hard to be a success and he's around performers and...  Anyway &quot;it's all happening.&quot;  By the way, that should be &quot;It's all happening at the zoo&quot; a lyric from the Simon and Garfunkel album in the opening scene.<br />Okay, okay.  I'm having a little trouble with this one.  I thought it was just so, so cute, and so touching and warm, even though I know it's only &quot;[my] rock and roll fantasy.&quot;  However I don't care.  I watched practically the whole thing with tears in my eyes, partially from nostalgia from the music and the clothes and the hair styles done so perfectly, and partly because the story of &quot;Penny Lane,&quot; sweet flower child groupie, &quot;seamstress for the band&quot; (to borrow a lyric) who has a &quot;rock and roll record&quot; to borrow another lyric (Great White, this time) who wears her sophistication on her sleeve to cover her heart that's also there.  And for a slightly nerdish kid who grows up before our eyes and falls in love and is too young to really be loved in return, a nervous writer on his first assignment who overwrites and sees the best in people, even as they treat him like a little girl, a kid who is so, so unsure of himself.  (Is writer and director Cameron Crowe again reprising his youth as he did so well in the script for the now classic coming of ager, Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)?)<br />Kate Hudson (Goldie Hawn's daughter) is unforgettable in a completely original creation dreamed up (or better yet, probably remembered) by Crowe, who here improves on his fine directorial work in Jerry Maguire (1996).  I understand that Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter 1997) was originally picked to play the part of Penny Lane, and she is a fine talent, but quite frankly Kate Hudson stole all the scenes she was in (she learned it from her mother!) and I don't think the movie would have been quite the beguiling, bittersweet experience it was without her.<br />Billy Crudup (a name to look at twice) manages to look exactly like all the wanna-be rock stars of the seventies wished they had while exuding the kind of charm that breaks hearts as Russell Hammond, guitarist for the band and Penny's true love.  Patrick Fugit is William Miller the would be teenaged writer as hero who is charming, boyish, vulnerable and well, heroic.  Frances McDormand plays his mother with just the right combination of pigheaded earnestness and her unique sense of the comedic.<br />The entire cast was terrific and the characters were truly original.  The Academy Award winning script was clever and at times profound, interspersed with sparkling lines.  (My favorite, from Lester Bangs on William's school mates: &quot;You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle.&quot;)  Also, and this is important, Crowe paid close attention to detail throughout and never lost his concentration.  Everything seemed amazingly authentic right down to the floral stitch on Russell's shirts and the bottles of Jack Daniels in his hands.  And nothing was done in a routine manner.  Every scene was carefully planned and even minor characters were roundly developed.  I'm thinking in particular of Lester Bangs, mentor and cynical rock critic brought to life in a fine performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and William's sweet and slightly dippy sister, vividly portrayed by Zooey Deschanel.  Notice how Crowe even took the trouble to satirize flight attendants with the parody of the stewardess uniforms (day glow orange!).<br />Yes, I loved this film, and I predict that the Academy, whose members obviously did not really SEE this film, will be rewarding the producers sometime down the road for the oversight.fine talent, but quite frankly Kate Hudson stole all the scenes she was in (she learned it from her mother!) and I don't think the movie would have been quite the beguiling, bittersweet experience it was without her.<br />Billy Crudup (a name to look at twice) manages to look exactly like all the wanna-be rock stars of the seventies wished they had while exuding the kind of charm that breaks hearts as Russell Hammond, guitarist for the band and Penny's true love.

B000000WGL|5.0|I waited for years for Keith to dump the Mickster and do a solo LP, and I was thrilled when he finally did.<br />A couple of straight Chuck Berry-ish numbers were to be expected.  But the Funk of &quot;Big Enough&quot; came out of nowhere, and I'm pretty sure that's Bootsy Collins who makes it work.  <br />I love the jam at the end of &quot;It Means A Lot,&quot; but it's the two slower tunes, &quot;Locked Away&quot; and especially &quot;Make No Mistake&quot; that convinced me that this is a classic album on a par with anything the Stones released except EXILE ON MAIN STREET.
6303168507|5.0|That's the tagline of Steven Spielberg's 1993 holocaust epic, SCHINDLER'S LIST (a film that has inspired me with my own film, TRIANGLE). What is this film? A documentary? A memorial service? A biopic? The answer is all of the above. It is a realistic look at a man who began as a womanizing criminal and ended as a sympathetic savior to thousands of Jewish people.<br />Based on Thomas Keneally's bestselling novel, it is passionate look at the Jewish struggle during the ghetto liquidation by the Nazis and in the concentration camps. <br />Filmed entirely on location in Poland and in black-and-white, with some color aspects, SCHINDLER'S LIST brings to life one of the saddest chapters in history. Starring Liam Neeson as industrialist Oskar Schindler; Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth; Ben Kingsley as Schindler's accountant Itzhak Stern; and Caroline Goodall as Schindler's wife, Emilie. <br />This is a film too sad to imagine, but also very important to watch and shameful to miss. Neeson does an extraordinary job in showing us the man who saved so many lives. A man whom most would call a pirate, he has shown us a brighter light. But, honestly, the one who impressed me (and shocked me the most) was Ralph Fiennes as a Nazi superior. Fiennes was known for playing romantic heroes on the London stage before playing such a dastardly role. (In the end, you can't help but cheer when he is eventually hanged.) And to Ben Kingsley (Oscar-winner for GANDHI), always the dependable one! His Stern provided me enough time to breathe a sign of relief and smile at his nervously mousy character. From his being trapped inside the train to his trying to reason with Schindler about the one-arm man's dependability working in the factory (a rare comedic moment in the film). <br />This is a triumph in every way possible! To watch a man, whom we never even heard of, save thousands of lives is heart-breakingly wonderful. Good job, Steven!<br />Winner of 7 Academy Awards including: Best Picture - Steven Spielberg, Branko Lustig &amp; Gerald R. Molen; Best Director - Steven Spielberg; Best Adapted Screenplay - Steven Zaillian; Best Cinematography - Janusz Kaminski; Best Art Direction/Set Decoration - Allan Starski, Ewa Braun; Best Score - John Williams; and Best Film Eediting - Michael Kahn.<br />Approximately: 3 HOURS and 17 MINUTES
0679777547|3.0|If you are the sort of reader that likes the &quot;perfume&quot; of intrigue without demanding any real &quot;substance&quot;, then this book is perfect for you. One review I have read calls it a &quot;beach book for intellectuals&quot; which is very close to the truth. Its not as good as Reverte may trick you into thinking it is, but is a very entertaining read for fans of the intellectual-thriller. The end of the book is a bit of a letdown, but that really fits the jaded mentality of the protagonist in a clever sort of a way. Pretty good book in my opinion.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Great! It almost captures all the angles of the drug problem.<br />I left the theatre depressed but thoughtful about this complex theme. It's one of those movies you enjoy watching many times and never get tired of it.<br />Traffic should have won the Oscar for best picture... No question about it.
B000059ZLH|4.0|I have to say there was a ton of hype regarding the release of this DVD and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. So I get the DVD , fine tune my stereo setup because it's not in 5.1. I then proceed to sit through almost 2 hrs of live Dream Theater, BUT several things bugged me about the DVD: The sound quality I felt lacked high-end (I ended up running it thru a EQ to fix this). Compared to Metallica's Cunning Stunts or Kiss' Second Coming it lacks some crispness to it. Second, there was way too many onstage static camera shots of the individual players, not enough audience shots and maybe a handful of stage shots. I felt that that took away from the feeling of it being live.<br />Now the good: The picture quality is spectacular, the transfer is amazing. The sound, even though it lacks high-end, is very warm and rich all the instruments are mixed well (yes John Myung's bass is low in the mix as usual). The performance is amazing, pratically flawless and to see them perform SFAM in it's entirety, a Change of Season and Learning To Live made it truly a DVD to cherish. I have yet to dive it into some of the extras and can't wait!!! Don't miss out on a great band and a great DVD.......
B00001OH7O|5.0|What is good about this album?<br />The lyrics? Even Dylan and Lennon meet their match here!<br />The tunes rival those of the Beatles.<br />The guitar playing of Ronson is almost as influential as Hendrix, yet generally unobtrusive enough to be almost entirely ignored by all but Ronson devotees.<br />The singing voice and style is as influential in its time as Billie Holiday, Elvis, or Sinatra were in theirs.<br />The production is as influential as Dark Side of the Moon's.<br />Want to make an album?<br />Here's your textbook!

6305657947|5.0|Or even marble stairs for that matter...  One of the most prominent remakes of the past decade, The Thomas Crown Affair, is a beautiful, magical, adventure; with Pierce Brosnan in the title role.  Having catapulted into the spotlight with his appearance as James Bond; (The only one I believe that has challenged Connery's hold over the part, but it is Connery afterall and Brosnan takes a cool second.) Brosnan has successfully escaped the role, unlike some of his predecessors, with films such as 'The Thomas Crown Affair' and his latest 'The Tailor Of Panamar'.  He has an ease on the screen that turns sharp when required, and is an absolute joy to watch.<br />The 1999 version has some alterations that had to be made to the 1968 format, for the main reason that the producers wished to bring modern aspects into the film, through the story, they didn't just want to rehash the original.  Thomas Crown's love of life is still ever present, through the representation of a catamaran race, a glider, and an expensive golf swing; His interest in banks has been replaced with a desire for the arts and the 1968 intense chess scene is gone, with a dance in its place and what a night!  Brosnan was upset when one journalist jumped to the assumption that he used a bottom double... he said 'No, it's mine, and I'm quite proud of it!'  It was also a delight to see a Kato 'Pink Panther' type character as Crown's butler, there's no fighting though, and I think it was just my mind going into overtime... it tends to stray.<br />The opening art heist is executed by an Albanian foursome, their entrance is a very old method, that works... and their exit? Well, you'll see.  But are they on their own, or do they have a backer... Indeed, a backer they have and the chase is on.  Rene Russo comes into play as the insurance investigator, Catherine Banning, a resourceful woman with a wealth of worldly experience, however she gets caught up in Crown's world and is forced to make some tough decisions.  Russo is great in the part, an extremely talented actress who has enjoyed many parts coupled to A-List actors.  The film brings with it a pleasure to see Faye Dunaway, appear in a cameo role as Crown's psychiatrist, she is truly one of Hollywood's veteran actresses.  It is a shame that Steve McQueen is not present.<br />The soundtrack is phenomenal and one that I treasure.  Sting heads it up with his version of 'Windmills Of Your Mind', along with songs from Nina Simone, Wasis Diop and Georges Fordant.  Having some South American in my blood, I love the journey that the music takes me on through the course of the film.  Together they are dynamite.  The DVD has a wondrous opening selection screen, and an elaborate commentary with many references to the original film.<br />The Thomas Crown Affair is a Romantic Action Adventure, but how will it all end... will they go away together, will he get caught, or as the original will their likenesses keep them apart... More importantly, will Mr Crown get away with it again... I hope so, but watch and see.
6304068549|5.0|I didn't like the first one very much but I really liked this one. It's one of my favorite movies of the 80's. Even though if I don't like the first one I sure do miss the movie because I hadn't seen it in awhile. I wonder if there's a soundtrack to this movie because I like the song at the ending of the movie. It would also be really cool if they made a Short Circuit 3 and there would be a Short Circuit Trilogy later on in the future. If you hadn't seen this movie yet go rent it you will like it if your a Short Circuit fan!
B00000DFMN|5.0|I was very young when this album was released, so I dont know the reception it got. I actually first heard some of the songs from Whos Afraid.. on the Real World Miami season. I looked them up and recently bought a copy at a flea market. Its very scratched and dirty but it plays decent enough. People, im telling you go get it. &quot;Moments In Love&quot; has to be the most beautiful song ive heard, and of course theres &quot;Beatbox&quot; and &quot;Snapshot&quot;. Any body remember that video where they smash all the instruments? A must have for any electronic music fan.
B00004T9UF|4.0|This was a good album.I liked EMINEM underground more though. He seemed more focused on the music, not the money.The only good songs on the album were,&quot;Stan&quot;,&quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;,Marshal Mathers&quot;,and &quot;Criminal&quot;. All the other songs he didn't seem focused on.As I said before, this album was INDEED very good.The songs such as &quot;Drug Ballad&quot;,and &quot;B**ch Please Part 2&quot; were halfway decent in my view.So I advise you to buy this album.That's all you're gettin from me! Or is it.......
0451191153|5.0|Best book ive ever read, hands down.
6301247485|5.0|I have never logged into this system before but I wanted to share some thoughts about the book and the film.  As an English instructor at the secondary and post-secondary level, I believe that Fitzgerald's novel is one of the finest in American Literature.  I have read and studied the work for 11 years and every word in the novel is important.  It would be impossible to effectively convey the entire work in another medium.   The 1974 film version is better than the 2001 version.  The original musical score in the 1974 version perfectly complements the narration and scenes.  The music, in this case, truly makes the movie.  I suggest one find the original version with the original score to truly appreciate the film. SENTIMENTALITY is the most significant aspect of the book and film.  After reading the book on no less than forty occassions and viewing the film with the original score no less than fifty times, I believe I am well qualified to present my opinion.<br />The major literary devices are present in the movie.  Redford, portraying Gatsby, reaches for the grren light on the other side.  It flashes, hauntingly, reminding him that he did, indeed, at one time have an opportunity to win Daisy, had it not been for the war.  Gatsby, Nick, and Daisy are all portrayed well.  Tom Buchannan is slick in the film and there is an inference that he is plotting to eliminate Gatsby. A slight deviation from the novel. The dialogue is commendable and incorporates the major themes from the novel into the film.   If you enjoy romance and sentimentality, I suggest you view this film.  Choose the correct version with the original score.  Look deep into the symbolism present throughout.  Feel the pain of Gatsby's despair.  Recognize the hope he once held is momentarily realized, only to once again fade.  Daisy;s love is fleeding; Gatsby's love is enduring.  That is the pain of Fitzgerald and Gatsby. Those wishing to hear a wonderful rendition of the original score may consider hearingLinda Ronstadt and the Nelson Riddle Orchestra's CD, &quot;What's New&quot;.  It makes me cry each time I listen. If anyone knows where I can purchase the 1974 version with the original soundtrack, please let me know.  I am also looking for the DVD version of the 1974 film.  My VCR copy of the film has faded away.  Thanks for your help.
6302759110|5.0|I loved the movie!!!! I will love it forever and I have two reasons why that I liked the movie because 1. when the wear wolf bumrushed the room and bit Lucy and then the nex thing you konw blood was splashed everywhere. 2. when Dracul turned into that wolf I though he was going to look even scarrier but he wasn't and the four thigns that are romantic abou the movie is 1. Is when dracula turned young again he saw Mina walking down the street and my favorite tune comes on and and he was staring at her. 2. Is when Mina and Dracula was in the theater I think they were in and he was about to bite her but he didn't and then the white wolf came and everybody was screaming and hollaring!! and when Mina came to that point where the wolf was at and the animal was about to bite her too since Dracula came and every thing went smoothly and then he told Mina to come to him and pet the wolf and when she came closer to the wolf and startted to pet the animal and the other tune that came was romantic too 3. Now that's when Dracula and Mina were alone togather and they weren't interupted at that point and when dracula said that he would give her eternal life and wants her to be his loving wife forever and so she agreeded with him on that. 4. When Mina was suckin the blood form his chest and then he was hugging her tightly and and there was another tune that I was really in love with so much and I just have to record that part over and over and over and over again!!! And my FAVORITE part from the rest of the movie was of course the ending the music sounds she beautiful!!! and I rate that as the #1 list of all time!!!!
0141000198|5.0|It was gifted to me by a woman, and came highly recommended.  Despite being a man, I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />Even got to understand the way women think a little better. ;)
6305169187|4.0|Well, if you like Ben Affleck this flick will give you ample opportunity to drool and gush because it has plenty of beefcake hero action.I found the story to be good, but not great.. this is certainly not a thinking movie...but I was entertained and I liked the interaction and relationships established in the film. The action was good..the beginninng sequence with the meteor shower was probaby the most enthralling and technical scene. I reccomend Armageddon greatly!
B00003CXE7|4.0|Could learn lessons in strategizing and leadership as applicable to business from this movie. ;)
6305095574|5.0|OOOh this movie!!! I was 14 years old, all the lights were on, my mom was ironing clothes right beside me and this movie scared the bejesus out of me!!!!!! Now, 32 years old and it is what I consider a Classic. From the nice pencil in the ankle scene to the beheading with the shovel. This movie rocks! &quot;Why have you disturbed our sleep, destroyed our ancient slumber.....YOU WILL DIE!!! One by one we will take you......&quot; Whew! That line still gives me chills. A nice horror flic. A beginning to the Ash legacy that lives today. Get this tape!!!
B000002H2H|5.0|Oh man, this is a great CD.  Probably my favorite followed close by the Black Album.  I feel that these albums are just pure adrenaline that I can listen to all day.  My favorite song is without a doubt Fight Fire With Fire.  How does Lars play that fast?  Ride the Lightning is a real solid song, with a great and lightning quick guitar solo.  For Whom The Bell Tolls is pure Metallica with great rhythm..I like the rest of the album too, particularly Creeping Death.  Ktulu was good on the studio album, but the S&amp;M version with the San Francisco Orchestra is noticeably better.  Overall, Metallica's finest work of the 80s.
B000056NX5|5.0|If you are a serious fan of anything to do with JCS you must see this new addition.  It is 10/10.  Theres nothing that I could say a negative thing about his movie.  The Actors are brilliante with magnificent voices, the score is about 99% the same but there are a few minor differences to the original which are of great addiction. There are a few different lycrics but mostly all original.  You would have to be a real negative person to say anything bad about his movie.  A must see for JCS fans!!!
B00004U8H4|4.0|Come on, all you people that are disappointed by this movie went in with a closed mind!!!  If you go into seeing this with the mind set that you are going to see your typical Hollywood horror movie, then you ARE going to be disappointed.  Instead, go into this with an open mind and just watch it and try to understand it for what it is.  I can't say what that is because that is up to the indvidual watching it to decide!  I am sure at this point you are saying HUH???   Trust me, just watch it and you'll understand what I am saying by the end.  I know I am going to stir up a lot of controversy by my next statement, but I wouldn't say it unless I meant it.  CHRISTIAN BALE gives one of the BEST performances I have ever seen by an actor.  Yes that is a strong statement, but I can't stop thinking about this movie and how he ABSOULETELY NAILED his performance.  His character was not an easy one to portray and the whole time I watched it the first two times, I couldn't get over how well he portrays this character.  While Tom Hanks gets a lot of accolades for his performances, I think a lot of his performances reflect his personality into the character.  This character that Christian portrays is complex, dark, and emotionless on the inside yet outgoing and extremely educated on the outside and Christian performs both sides to absolute perfection.  The whole time you watch him you just marvel at how well he pulls off everything he does.  The rest of the characters within the movie really don't contribute much other than a supporting cast.  Christian is the star and what makes this movie what it is.  Is the movie disturbing in parts???  Yes!  Is it sexist???  Yes!!  Do the characters display superficiality??? Yes!!  All of this though itertwines into the story and helps add humor to it by making fun of the 80's &quot;ME&quot; decade. This movie is branded a dark comedy but don't go into thinking you are going to see &quot;Weekend at Bernies&quot; type humor.  This movie isn't for everybody, but if you have an open mind and don't go into it with any expectations, you should enjoy it for the type of movie it is and for the acting performance you are about to see.  The ending is enough alone to make you watch and want to see it again!
B000000JO3|5.0|Interestingly enough Minor Threat was the band of my youth.  I had the opportunity to see them live when I was at the tender age of fourteen. And at thirty three I still love Minor Threat and also Fugazi. I have their music on vinyl, but this cd is a must have for any real punk at heart.
B00005AKQE|5.0|I have purchased both creed CD's and love listening to them. When i heard &quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot; i was like wow new creed i have to get that song. so i was told it was only on the european copy of Human Clay so i was out of luck until i looked up Amazon.com and found the import copy of Human Clay.I already have Human Clay but the import copy with &quot;young grow old&quot; and a 5 song bonus CD including my fave creed song right now &quot;To Who It May Concern&quot; makes it all well worth buying it again. now i can't wait to pick up the import of My Own Prison with the 2 extra songs and thier new album. It is no wonder why Creed is my favorite rock band thier just amazing.
B00005B6C9|3.0|I'm as big a fan as anyone but don't believe these inflated, 5-star reviews.  I think our boys really need an outside producer to help shape their material and vocals.  For a trio so known for their soaring harmonies, there are only a couple of tracks that show them off. Someone needs to tell Barry that his breathy vocal style is just too precious. Just sing the song!  You know how!  And there's a certain lack of warmth to most of the album, too much techno production and drum machines.  On the positive side, it's a big improvement over the mediocre Still Waters and this one gets through seven straight listenable and enjoyable tracks before running into a truly terrible one (Maurice's WALKING ON AIR).  Again, don't believe the rave 5-star reviews. If you are like me and think their material has been hit-and-miss since their ONE cd came out, then this one won't surprise you.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Beauty is a subjective thing, not objective.  I know it's been said before, but it is truly in the eye of the beholder.  That is what we find here.  Spacey sees beauty in simplicity.  His daughter sees it in the individuality of her neighbor.  Bening's character finds it in success, and cloak-and-dagger affairs. The gay neighbor and distanced wife see it in the Leave it to Beaver ideal. <br />But the most beautiful character of all is the artist, who pulls together the most coherent, stunning, socially critical film on a level with Fight Club.  I would watch that bag float for hours; I can watch newspapers race across a cracked cement road, crumbling underfoot, for an eternity.  <br />People blasted this movie for it's &quot;glorification of sex and drugs.&quot;  No, I say.  Not in the least.  This is America we are living in, isn't it?  Home of the brainless, land of the moral slaves?  <br />I am a painter, a writer, and a philosopher.  I felt I could not even weep at the end, so beautiful was it.  I walked out of that theater rethinking my grounds of the picturesque.  My friend walked out and said: &quot;I'm sick of these sex-crazed degenerate Jerry Springer films.&quot;<br />I'm sick of people's intolerance.  I'm sick of people's hate of life, treating it as though the mere beating of a heart were a sin that needs forgiving.  Why execrate ourselves?  Why execrate this movie, which is merely being true to every one of our &quot;selves&quot;, and, in turn, execrating ourselves in this eternal chain of hate?  Beauty is all around you.  This film captures it in life and death.

B00003W8NM|5.0|Hmmmm....The entire world seems to have missed the point.  This is not just a story of rebellion and self-destructive philosophy to find some strange form of enlightenment.  This is not just silly lines and guys fighting violently.  Not just sex.  Not just insanity.  This is certainly not a story of freedom.<br />There is a political and social message I've noticed not many people are recieving.  It's a poke at every radical out there who fights against &quot;the Establishment&quot; or the &quot;Man.&quot;  Watch this movie again.  Fight Club begins as something innocent, a way to rebel against standardized norms of pleasure.  What it transforms into is a terrorist regime.  Sure, in Fight Club they managed to escape from enslaving jobs and the &quot;oppression&quot; of modern suburbia through this unsanctioned variety of rituals.  But in Project Mayhem, the innocence of rebellion turns into e x a c t l y what they tried to escape from.  It's all right there in the mantra of Project Mayhem: &quot;Sir, we do not ask questions in Project Mayhem, Sir.&quot;  They become Space Monkeys, like the slaves to nine-to-fivers, the old lives they think they've destroyed.  Everything comes back to where it started.  The rebels form their own chains of self-oppression.  In order to rebel, they must establish a conformist society (Project Mayhem).  They lose their names and personal identities--exactly what they hated about regular society and jobs that lead to anonymity and industrial disallusionment.  The means to usurpation are different, but the underlying bases of Project Mayhem are just as empty and disgusting as the real world's foundations. I suppose this, like many great films of our era, would be easily misinterpreted by the idiots looking for blood and violence, and stupid lines.  Critics looking for sub-par Titanics.   The empty-minded award givers who gave Michael Caine (Michae Caine!) an Academy Award for one of hte worst written, acted, and directed movies ever--Cider House Rules.  (Let us not forget: &quot;What's your business, boy!) I am a writer and an artist and philosopher--Fight Club appealed to all three facets of my being.<br />To all the kids who started their own fight clubs, and you'd be surprised at how many actually did--the idiots--I say this: actually read into the movie.  If you have any ability to interpret intelligent symbols, you will see past what everyone else praises emptily.  Don't be a Space Monkey--the movie managed to fool more people than even Palahniuk, the writer of the book.  <br />David Fincher, Pitt, and Norton deserved Academy Awards.  Especially Fincher.  Probably the greatest social analysis in film of any generation.  The rest is just delicious garnishing.
B000059Z8J|5.0|At last, Superman is presented the way it was meant to be! The master print for the 1978 classic had deteriorated so badly that the film, particularly the white-on-white Krypton opening scenes, was almost unwatchable. (I had even gone so far as to write a critique on Amazon.com demanding a 'Director's Cut' DVD edition, digitally transferred and remastered, be made!)<br />  Somebody was listening! While this isn't a 'Director's Cut' (Donner has said that the version that premiered in 1978 was the version he preferred), the movie has been expanded, to include a couple of brief scenes with Brando, and the famous Superman Gauntlet sequence at Luthor's underground lair (the remaining unused sequences can be seen in the 'Deleted Scenes' Chapter, on Side 2).<br />Technically, the DVD is fabulous; the Krypton sequences are now clean and sharp, a couple of shots where, previously, color balancing problems had turned Superman's costume green have been corrected, and, best of all, the soundtrack has been digitally remastered and sounds even better than it did in 1978!<br />Three fabulous documentaries are included on Side 2 about the making of the film, and how the flying effects were achieved. This was an incredibly expensive and difficult film to make (so much so that Donner, after 'Superman' was released to rave reviews, was fired, and replaced by Richard Lester, for 'Superman 2'), and through interviews with Donner, Christopher Reeve (who is honored for his work in the film, and his courage since his crippling accident), Margot Kidder, Gene Hackman, and several of the creative team, you can appreciate what a unique and wonderful film this is!<br />Two other 'pluses'; a full-length audio commentary track with Richard Donner, and a 'music only' option, where you can admire one of composer John Williams' greatest scores!<br />This Special Edition DVD should be an essential part of any film lover's collection!
079070546X|5.0|This is one of the few movies that I have laughed uncontrollably at.  The film immediately gives the viewer a taste of what is to come later when the family is first searching for the &quot;Griswold Family Christmas Tree&quot; out in a rural setting.  The family, in their beat up station wagon, gets harassed by a couple of rednecks who end up playing chicken on the road with Clark, the father (Chase).  As the movie progresses towards the final scenes on Christmas Eve and more family members arrive, the scenes become more outrageous, like the issues that rise when both sets of grandparents arrive or the measures Clark takes to decorate the house with Christmas lights. When he finally succeeds in lighting the house, the movie shifts into a different gear when Ellen, Clark's wife's (D'Angelo) cousin Eddie (Quaid) and his family arrives on the scene via a barely running RV with their rottweiler dog that is aptly named for a body condition.  The film is stuck in high gear after this, as scenes become more disastrous and hilarious.  The Christmas Eve dinner features the entire family along with Clark's Aunt Bethany and Uncle Lewis and their senile demeanors.  Random scenes like the dog &quot;yakkin' on a bone&quot; during dinner or Bethany's house cat mistakenly wrapped up as a Christmas present add to the hilarity. The movie ends when Clark finds out that he has been shafted by his boss and Cousin Eddie decides to do something about it.  A great holiday classic with many more random, funny scenes not mentioned in this review.
076783819X|3.0|This is yet another thriller about an evil neighbor (played by Tim Robbins) settling into a typical Norman Rockwell-ish community and of course, sooner or later, brings hell into the life of a family, with Jeff Bridges investigating the newcomer's past. I liked both of the performances by the leads and the director does indeed know how to work up some occassionally  genuinely frightening chills. But overall the script is not as strong as it should have been and for anyone who at least has half a brain wouldn't believe most of the goings-on in the film. Yet another thing I enjoyed about the film is how fast paced it is and how interestingly (if, once again, implausibly) the film worked up to an exciting ending and drove home a potent message: good guys don't always finish first. I'd say that this would have been a much better thriller if the writer added some more surprises, took out some silly contrivances, and added at least one original idea!
6305078564|5.0|I'm a young reader, and also declare myself an unconditional Austen's fan. When I first read one of her books (usually I repeat) I only feel discontent in one particular way: I want to  meet the characters, SEE THEM! With P&amp;P I felt the same, so I borrowed the DVD from a friend. It was amazing, they  just where there, in the real world. I first thought the characters had come to live in Colin Firth's and Jennifer Ehle's bodies! I never saw a film so much according to the original book, I could say even improving it! If you watch that film you won't feel deceived, I promise!
B000059ZLH|5.0|Dream Theater's concept album Scenes From A Memory is jaw-dropping on CD, but one gains a whole new level of appreciation for the work when one sees it performed. I mean, Dream Theater plays some really complex stuff here, and it's awesome to watch. &quot;The Dance of Eternity&quot; is insane, and the instrumental section of &quot;Beyond this Life&quot; has some really tough harmonization and unison lines. John Myung's dexterous bass playing is especially incredible to see because it's sometimes difficult to hear him in the mix on the CD. Jordan Rudess is truly a god among keyboardists, and I don't doubt that in a few years we'll regard him with the same deference as legends like Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson. It's almost uncanny how easily he plays everything. What's also interesting about him is that he doesn't use racks of keyboards; he controls everything from just one, and switches between sounds with a pedal. Very cool. For much of the show, I just sat there with my jaw constantly hitting the floor thinking, &quot;How the freakin' heck do they do that?&quot;<br />The band puts on an incredible show. The band usually has a sort of calm stage presence, but here they're gushing energy. LaBrie's vocals never miss their mark, and in some ways his performance is better here than on the CD. I hadn't realized he had this much live power (let's not forget that he's an operatically trained vocalist, too). The band recreates SFAM's story using images on the big screens, which is good for those who didn't quite grasp the plot. (I understood the story, but it was nice to finally see what the breaking glass was on &quot;Finally Free.&quot;) The band also brings in the hypnotherapist, the gospel choir for &quot;The Spirit Carries On,&quot; and Theresa Thomason to sing Victoria's lines on that same song. Here, they've essentially recreated the album better than I could have imagined.<br />The bonus material is great. Personally, I found the &quot;Making Of&quot; section very interesting, and the band's audio commentary for the concert is really quite funny. The &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot; are a dream come true. I never expected to see the band perform &quot;A Mind Beside Itself&quot; in its entirety, and the electric version of &quot;The Silent Man&quot; is an intense extension of the original song. &quot;Learning to Live&quot; is a great anthemic song, even better here because of LaBrie's vocal improvisation during Petrucci's heroic guitar solo (the one right after LaBrie's hits that high F). And the best of all... &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; as an encore, with some fun embellishments during &quot;IV. The Darkest of Winters.&quot;<br />What I'm getting at is...this DVD is incredible.

B00000K0DT|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning screenplay deserves a great deal of praise. Kevin Spacey gives a wonderful and memorable performance as Verbal Kint, as does Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, and Kevin Pollack. This movie is well worth your money.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is the cd that started it all for my descent into the world of death metal. First, this is not death metal. Slipknot fits their own genre in my mind, a hybrid of hardcore, thrash/death influences, some nu-metal, and some hip hop. However, it is VERY aggressive, and is quite possibly the most pissed-off recording I have heard in a long time. The total outflowing of anger can be felt on each and every song, as is pain and anguish and the crushing anxiety of living in misery. Thats not to say this is depressing; in fact, it is quite cathartic. With each playing I put this through, I feel a release from all forms of anger and pressure built up during my life. Back to the CD itself. The band is a nine piece set, composed of 2 guitarists, a drummer, 2 percussionists, a sampler, a DJ, a bassist, and of course, a singer. The music is driven by the immense range of Corey Taylor, quite possibly THE best new singer in the rock world today. He switches from an angry scream to a melodic voice that is very haunting. The pummeling drums from Joey are also very good; check out those bass pedals on Surfacing. The guitars are not really technical, but they are aggressive and creative throughout. What stands out most are the samples, scratches and eerie percussion throughout, creating some weird sounds that scare you the first time( listen to Tattered and Torn and Surfacing). Standout tracks: Sic, Eyeless, Surfacing, Spit it Out, Purity, and Scissors. If you like this, I reccomend Slayer, Mudvayne, Sepultura, Soulfly and some of the death/grindcore scene. I reccomend you buy this cd, it has changed my life.
1558216847|5.0|I discovered this book through a rave review from The Common Reader which also signalled that it was back in print finally.  As others have recounted, the book tells the incredible tale of the prisoners' escape from Siberia (and the harrowing journey to get there) as they cover 30 miles a day on their way to India.  It's amazing the level of detail the author is able to recall and the hospitality of the Mongols and Tibetans he met along the journey.  Reduced to starvation and exhaustion (especially after the harrowing crossing of the Gobi Desert), they exist meal to meal looking for food and water.  Even in this state, their humanity shines through as they grieve for the ones who died on the journey (the story of Kristina is one of the most touching you'll ever read) and push each other as they climb the Himilayan peaks in shabby clothing and moccasins.  An incredible tale of survival and determination, well written and well recalled.  Inspiring and life changing.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I love dream theatre and this is the best concert ever!! hey, but theres one problem with this concert disc you can't play it in your sony cd walkman!! that is dumb, i think james labrie is the best singer ever and john petrucci is so good at guitar he's probably amazing at bass too. but jon myung plays bass so that's cool. buy this concert now!
B000002JNJ|4.0|Who wrote that this was a glam cd? It's not glam. I know Pantera were glam at first, but that was before Phil joined around '88. This is METAL, no 'if's or 'but's. Why are there so many crap comparisons in various reviews (including the official Amazon.com review)? I like Metallica, but Pil does NOT sound like James Hetfield.<br />Anyway, on to the CD. I have to say that this is one of Pantera's best, albeit lightest album. If you're looking for an accurate example of Pantera then you probably won't find it here. After this album they were heavier and more 90s. Not to say that this isn't heavy. Think of Meat Loaf carrying a bag of bricks and you kinda come close to how heavy this CD is. Phil's vocals are amazing here, reaching heights that rival Rob Halford of all people. Apparently he got some throat infection after this album, which is why there was no more of that on any other Pantera album.<br />Almost every song is great, no bad riffs, no bad solos and no bad vocals. There's quite a lot of variety as well - ballads (Cemetary Gates, The Sleep) - midpaced crunchers (title track, Psycho Holiday, Domination) - and fast thrashers (Heresy, Shattered, Art Of Shredding). The only bad song is Primal Concrete Sledge and perhaps Message In Blood, but even then loads people like those songs as well. Even though I don't like them, I wouldn't say they were fillers.<br />A great CD that only just misses out on a 5 star review. Also check out the live album, Vulgar Display Of Power or Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society if you like this.
B000002NJS|5.0|As many people know, Madonna began experimenting with electronica during her &quot;Erotica&quot; days, but this album brings a whole new meaning to electronica (thanks to William Orbit) not to mention putting it on the homefront. Spirtually overwhelmed is one way to describe this album, because it discusses a wide range of subjects such as Death, Happiness, Depression, Nostalgia, the list goes on and on. Although there were a couple of singles that totally flopped on the billboards, they are all favorites in my book, such as: &quot;Drowned World/Subsitute For Love&quot; a very touching song, it's a ballad, and at the end of the song she says &quot;This is my religion&quot; letting you know how in depth spirtually this album will be, &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; a club favorite where the synthesizer plays a major role and features Madonna's vocals in full confidence, &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; has oddball lyrics, but if you focus on the lyrics you will see it's about a drug user, I didn't care for the song at first but I have grown to love it &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; was a low charting dance hit, but has always been a favorite of mine inspired by some Japanese geisha girl(have you seen the video??), &quot;Shanti/Ashtangi&quot; is a song sung in Sanskrit but very beautiful, &quot;Frozen&quot; the first single off the album, and a big hit for maddy. The synthesizer keys get distorted during the middle of the song making the song sound very odd. &quot;The Power Of Good-Bye&quot; literally made me cry, and is about somebody parting there loved one, but the only problem is that Madonna's vocals are distant but are very strong nonethess, &quot;Mer Girl&quot; deals with Madonna's loss of her Mother and also made me cry and cringe simulataneously.<br />If you watched &quot;The Grammys&quot; a couple of years ago, this album picked up four grammys and put Madonna's name at the top of the list again. So if your beginning to collect some of Madonna's albums I'd startwith this one, or if you are just a music lover, this is definitely a good buy. =)
B0000028RR|4.0|Lets face it - Evil Empire and Battle Of LA [stunk]. Renegades isn't to grand either. This is the only good offering from the band. But that said, it is very good. Although I don't like rap (and Zach de la Rocha is no real exception), I do like this because the music, unlike every other rap &quot;music&quot; that I've heard, does actually take talent. OK so Timmy C. and Brad Wilk are nothing special but they are tight and they do the job very well. Tom Morrello is a very good guitarist. Leads on songs like Killing In The Name and Take The Power Back are very well executed. He's not in the same league as Zakk Wylde (Ozzy solo, Black Label Society), Dimebag Darrel (Pantera) or Adrian Smith (Iron Maiden) but he is nonetheless a good guitarist. I do respect innovation, but this is by far his finest hour. He wasn't [fooling] around with effects pedals and allan keys, he driving at us with good quality guitar work in both the lead and rhythm department. Throw in some aggressive, well written political lyrics and you will be more than satisfied.<br />This is their best work and an album that fans of both skools can enjoy. There's not a bad song on this album (although I don't care much for fistful of steel). It's not one of my personal classics (hence 4 and not 5 stars) but it will be remembered for years to come.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this album recently and other than Moby's Play, this is the best album that I ever purchased considering that I only had heard of 1 song on the album.  That 1 song was Thank You which at first I didn't like.  But, I heard it so many times that I started to like it.  Then I went to Amazon and read the reviews which the majority were positive.  The last time that I took a chance, I struck gold with Moby's Play (which I think in time will be recognized as one of the truly great albums of all-time).  Here's the track listing and my thoughts on each:<br />1) Here With Me -- Believe it or not, I honestly had never heard this song until I bought the album.  I fell in love with it immediately!  What a great song.  This song has everything--great instrumentation and arrangement by Rollo and Rick Nowells and of course smooth vocals by Dido, who helped co-write this song (she co-writes every song on the album).   2) Hunter -- A very underrated song.  It's one of those songs that gets better after every listen. 3) Don't Think of Me -- Another standout track.  It's very close to being my favorite track on the album, battling along with Here With Me and Thank You.  Once again, very polished and flawless vocals by Dido and great production by the individual that simply goes by Youth.  I'm not one that gets into lyrics, but the lyrics to this song are awesome! 4) My Lover's Gone -- A ballad--it's an interesting change of pace compared to the first 3 songs.  Solid song but not as good as the first 3 or the next 2. 5) All You Want -- A pretty good track with once again thought-provoking lyrics.  You might be saying to yourself, &quot;Can it get any better than this?&quot;  The answer is a resounding YES! 6) Thank You -- The reason that the answer is yes is because of this track--the one that I bought this album for.  I just love the overall feel and texture of this song.  As most people know, the first verse was used in the useless Eminem song, Stan.  That's the only brightthing that idiot has done in his whole life is to use Dido. 7) Honestly OK -- An alright track but one that I don't get excited about. 8) Slide -- Another solid performance by Dido.  A pretty spooky track at time with the instrumentation. 9) Isobel -- Another track that I feel so-so about. 10) I'm No Angel -- One of the better later tracks that continues to showcase the things that Dido does so well. 11) My Life -- An alright and decent song. 12) Take my Hand -- A bonus track that is a little over 6 minutes long, it's a very good track.  It's the most danceable track and even has a little techno in it.  I think Dido could be an excellent Dance/Techno artist if she wanted to.<br />In summary, get this album because of tracks #1, #2, #3, #5, #6, #8, #10, and #12.  This album has to rank as one of the best debut albums in recent years.  Dido definitely has a bright future ahead of her!
B000002H97|5.0|Just like a fine wine, this album just gets better with age.  This is one of the first CD's I ever bought,  and I have to say that this is probably the best album I have ever listened to.  I was in the 10th grade when this album came roaring onto the scene in 1991, and I have to say that this album more than stands the test of time.  There are 12 songs on the album, and each one is a musical masterpiece.  From &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; to &quot;The Struggle Within&quot;, this album is packed with roaring, blistering guitars and massive, slammin' drum tracks.  Even if you are not a metal fan, I highly recommend that you add this to your music collection.  20 million metallifans can't be wrong!!
B000001F3C|5.0|Back when I shaved and/or spiked my hair, wore all-black clothes, and hung around in dirty alleys after hall shows, waiting for a glimpse of my heroes (Bono, The Edge, Adam, and Larry), U2 could do no wrong. Almost 20 years and some grey hair later, War's mix of thunder and lush quiet is still perfection to my ears. With just enough rage and anguish, Sunday Bloody Sunday incites the listener's heart to rebel, to fight (although on Under A Blood Red Sky, Bono states that this song is not a rebel song). New Year's Day's intertwining piano/bass riff is one of the most evocative rock openings I've ever heard. As far as I'm concerned, NYD's intro is just memorable as the intros to Satisfaction and Superstition. Evolving into a gorgeous tale of woe, it spirals downward until Edge's soaring guitar solo saves us from despair. Although I prefer the manic club remix of Two Hearts Beat As One, the CD version does not disappoint. It hammers the chest and head with Adam's throbbing bass, Larry's frantic drumming, Edge's frenetic guitar playing, and Bono breathless singing. More political than THBAO, Like A Song... is just as relentless. My favorite track is Drowning Man which still makes me ache like a gloomy November day. Hearing Seconds again, gave me my biggest surprise. Dance moody music, its &quot;funky&quot; bass reminds me of newer songs like Radiohead's The National Anthem or maybe even Moby. The Refugee brings in some different rhythms that add another texture to the CD. Red Light and Surrender slow the tempo down but the urgency remains. 40 brings us home. Sounding raw, hungry, and earnest, U2's War is a complete work, an old-fashioned guitar driven rock CD that has no wasted moments or even pauses.
B000000H4V|3.0|My introduction to Sepultura was Roots, which totally blew me away. Then I bought Arise and Schizophrenia, and they were even better! Roots was sludgy but heavy and full of experimentation while their earlier efforts (my personal favs) being thrash and really fast and heavy. So with Chaos A.D., what went wrong?<br />A mixture of two styles that Sepultura did really well could have been great (and it appears that 'great' is how most people view this album). But in my opinion, this falls short of both. The majority of songs aren't that thrashy, and those that are sound very amatuerish and boring compared to what was offered previously (especially &quot;Slave New World&quot; and &quot;Biotech Is Godzilla&quot; - just compare those song structures and riffs to &quot;From The Past Comes The Storms&quot; or &quot;Dead Embryonic Cells&quot;). And as for experimental aspects and acoustic tracks which emulate Brazilian tribe music, only &quot;Kaiwos&quot; comes close to tracks such &quot;Jasco&quot;, &quot;Attitude&quot; or &quot;Itsari&quot;. And solos? Yes, there may be none on Roots which is (the only) one aspect of this album which is better than Roots. But compare the solos on this to Andreas's lead work on previous albums. Sometimes it's hard to believe its the same group.<br />It could have been their best album - a collaboration of sounds that Sepultura did better than most. Instead it falls short of both elements instead of fusing them together well and often sounds like a bunch of Sepultura wannabes. There are a few up points, namely Refuse/Resist, Territory (although the solo is terrible) and Kaiwos, but generally this is very disappointing.
B000059Z8J|5.0|A nearly flawless DVD rendering of &quot;Superman&quot; with remastered sound and picture. This extended 151 minute cut with eight new minutes is a true must have. Not only does it look and sound great but has tons of extras worthy of it's bargain price. The best is the music only track of John Williams' wonderful score and makes a worthy companion to the audio CD. The only flaw is that the remixed sound effects on the main titles nearly drown out the music but that's a minor quibble in an otherwise outstanding DVD.
B00005B6C9|5.0|My title says it all.  I count this to be their 22nd album of all new material; however, this is counting Saturday Night Fever and Stayin' Alive as albums when they really were movie soundtracks.  I have every Bee Gees albums except for Living Eyes (which needs to be put back in print, so I can get it), so I knew that this was a must buy.  A couple of things to say before I list each track:  1) the people who gave this a negative review are either people who are expecting another Main Course or Spirits or they are people who have a negative opinion about the Brothers Gibb because of SNF (this is mainly American radio). 2) A couple of people said that this was the best Bee Gees CD since 2 Years On.  I'm sorry but with the exception of Lonely Days and Man For All Seasons, 2 Years On was an album full of filler.  There are about 20 other Bee Gees albums that are better including this one.  Here's a track listing and my thoughts on each:<br />1) This Is Where I Came In -- The title track and one of my favorites.  Great vocals and  instrumentation are hallmarks of this song.  Reminds me alot of New York Mining Disaster 1941. 2) She Keeps On Coming -- A pretty good track with great vocals by my favorite Gibb brother, Robin.  It's a song that reminds me of an ELO song.  It has a chorus that will stick in your head. 3) Sacred Trust -- A pretty good ballad that is handled well by Barry.  Reminds me of other great ballads like First of May and Don't Wanna Live Inside Myself. 4) Wedding Day -- Definitely one of the best songs on the album.  You better believe that this song will be one that you will hear at weddings.  It's already been played some on the TV show, Providence. 5) Man In the Middle -- A Mo song.  It's alot like Omega Man from Size Isn't Everything.  Many people don't know how to react to a Bee Gees song with Maurice singing the lead simply because they are not used to him singing lead.  However, this song has a very catchy hook. 6) Deja Vu -- Another fine performance by the inimitable Robin. 7) Technicolor Dreams -- An interesting song to say the least!  Reminds me of Winchester Cathedral.  Definitely not a disco song.  Barry gives a fine performance as usual, but I don't really care for ragtime jazz. 8) Walking On Air -- Another Mo song.  Not as good as Man In the Middle. 9) Loose Talk Costs Lives -- A magnificent ballad by Barry.  It's better than Sacred Trust. 10) Embrace -- This song along with the title track features the brothers at their very best--singing together and harmonizing. 11) The Extra Mile -- An okay song.  Don't really have any other feelings about it. 12) Voice In the Wilderness -- The only true rock song on the album.  It reminds me of Down the Road and Heavy Breathing--2 songs that were on their album, Mr. Natural.  Not alot of people have heard the Bee Gees sing this style, so they don't know how to react except to react negatively.  However, as they have proven over their 35+ year career, they can sing in a variety of different styles.<br />All in all, this is a Bee Gees album that comes close to overtaking One and Size Isn't Everything as their best album since their post Spirits day.  The best tracks are #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #9, and #10.  It's unrealistic to expect another Main Course or Odessa with this album simply because the brothers have matured over the years.  Here's hoping that American radio and the American public get over their phobia of the Bee Gees and give this album a chance.  I guarantee you that it will be a big hit everywhere else in the world which is a very sad commentary on our society.<br />P.S. Whoever is in charge of their label, please put Living Eyes back in print, so my Bee Gees collection can be complete!
B00004XOWN|4.0|This CD is like techno alien music. It is cool. If you listen to the songs you will not get bored of them. I think you all will like this CD. Just buy it. If you don't like it give it to me.  Limp Bizket is not like rap or nothing. All the songs are cool. I think so. I think you will like this. It's all good. I think so. You will probably like it. It's cool. Yes it's cool. It is so cool!END
B000002B5L|1.0|I believe this country has a problem with what it considers racism to be, and this album shows that the musical industry is no exception.  The Lead-singing lady of this band made the comment that she doesn't want white people to buy her records, going so far as saying that she would rather have her children starve than have their food bought with the dirty money of the white people of this country.  Of course no one made the attempt of calling her racist, because that's the way this country's media has been controlled lately.<br />Musically, the album is not that bad.  I'm going off what I heard on the radio a few years back.  But there are tons of albums out there that aren't &quot;bad.&quot;  It's what you say in your music, what you do with it, the message you try to convey that makes the album.  And if this woman is trying to show that color can still segregate us, does the album deserve more than one star?  Too bad not all music can be for everyone...
0790749998|4.0|This was one BAAAAAAD (good BAAAAAAD) title. It had comedy, it had action, it had... well yeah thats bout it but it was awesome. I must say that although most people may complain about camera angels, they are nowhere near as bad as the farmclub videos. Most people dont understand that to capture the action requires a variety of angels, otherwise the speed will slow down and the scenes will get repetitive... and that blows. To keep action alive you need new angles, and I really didn't notice a problem. The plot itself is deeper than the naked mind might perceive. Han takes jail time for his father and brother when they flee to America... so he breaks out after he finds out his little brother dies and tries to find out who killed him. And that's just the beginning... wait till you find out how he gets mixed up with a family of African-American mobsters. But I won't spoil the rest-take a look at this movie. If you like action or comedy or even romance... its got it all.
B00004YRQA|1.0|I was happy when I saw that my Memory card arrived, and at first I had no problems. All I was thinking was the only drawback is that it had to save an animated icon on every file (Starwars Starfighter save: 133KB could take about: 100B to save if they didnt use icons 1024B=1KB).<br /> Suddenly after owning it for a week, while playing an ATV OFFROAD Fury game for some reason it corrupted my Oni Musha game (shows up corrupt) and is UNDELETEABLE it also has a ? for the size so I CAN NOT MAKE ANY NEW SAVES IN ANY GAME. I went online to look for utilitiesfor fixing it, and the only information on data repair / reformating was for the JAP playstation (they had a repair disc) I tried saving over it in OniMusha (didnt work) tried opening the card with all my games (in hope that they had a repair in one game) nothing.<br />Setup: I do not have an irregular setup, NO MODIFICATIONS to the card or system, and Im NOT even using a multitap
B00005B6C9|5.0|Maybe this will be the album that finally makes it clear to the mainstream that the BeeGees are not (and should not be labeled as) a disco-only group. Frankly, those who do not research the BeeGees' music both before and after disco are really missing out on what is potentially the most meaningful music they will ever have the pleasure of hearing.<br />Though their post-disco output is excellent in its synthesized, atmospheric grandeur (I would recommend ESP, Size Isn't Everything, and One), This Is Where I Came In is a stripped-down album that marks a return of sorts to the BeeGees' old-fashioned style of music from the late 60's. They recorded most vocals on this album around a single microphone and with the use of few synthesizers.   <br />The brothers Gibb have said that they wanted to experiment with as many different styles of music on this album as they could. Here you will find elements of pop, R&amp;B, rock, jazz, blues, and even a trace of gospel. Highlights include the title track, &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot;, &quot;Wedding Day&quot;, &quot;Man In The Middle&quot;, &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Loose Talk Costs Lives&quot;.<br />This Is Where I Came In is yet another poignant reminder that the BeeGees are a creative musical force to be reckoned with.  After 35 years in the business, Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb show through this album that you really can go home!
0783233477|5.0|Unlike any movie I've seen, this talks about life and death and how love can be appreciated by death. Brad Pitt played a wonderful job as the Spirit of Death (codenamed Joe Black by Anthony Hopkins) inside the body of man who Claire Fontani met in a diner somewhere in New York. Claire is a very beautiful actress and I hope she will do another romantic movie with her charm. For Anthony Hopkins, who plays as a rich CEO of a communications company, has done a good job as a man trying to deal with Joe Black in his house. At first, when Anthony Hopkins hears the voices of death in the beginning, he felt strange but he learns who the person is talking to is in his house and that he is Joe Black. The reason Death is in the body of the man from the diner Susan met is because the man got knocked out in an accident and Death occupies the body because he is on vacation. Joe Black soon gets aquainted with the essence of people and falls for Susan Parrish who was in love with this man who thought Joe was pretty weird with his obsession with peanut butter, jelly cookies, and nice tea. Susan leaves the boyfriend behind and loves Joe Black. However, Joe Black has to deal with Susan's Father's fate, which could be the end of his life during his vacation. This was a great movie because it talked about what love is and it shows who Death really is.
B00003CXQY|5.0|It Rocks!  One of the best disney movies around.  Not all that horrible singing.  It will make you laugh.   Fun for all ages.  Very close to being as good as Aladdin.  Maybe even better.
B000002AGN|4.0|I won't go into the details about time signatures or the history of this-or-that school of jazz (there are hundreds who have done better at this then I ever could).  The only thing I feel needs to be said that I haven't heard from many others is that &quot;Time Out&quot; is an amazing introduction to cool jazz: absolutely undeniable, BUT, the &quot;odd-meter experiments&quot; wore out quickly on me.  Don't get me wrong: this is a classic (and brilliant) jazz album that has &quot;stood the test of time&quot; but it's kind of like &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; by Deep Purple...everyone knows that it is a classic, it got a lot of people listening to listening to rock, but soon enough they moved on to more subtle, nuanced styles.  I suppose &quot;Time Out&quot; is the inspirational Kindergarden teacher whom we owe so much to but had to move beyond.  A great intro-to-jazz album, and if you're already a jazz fan and don't have this album I can only ask, &quot;Why don't you?&quot;
B000020617|5.0|I have been a fan of the Foo Fighters for so long. There is Nothing Left to Lose is a wonderful album that shows a different side of Dave Grohl then The Colour and the Shape did. &quot;Aurora&quot; is a beautiful song about his grandmother, and it shows Dave's softer side. &quot;Breakout&quot; and &quot;Stacked Actors&quot; are two other great songs that show Dave's more rough side, but still wonderful. All of the Foo Fighter's songs have a true beautiful meaning behind them and Dave Grohl is truely an inspiration. Anyone who doesn't have this CD is crazy. This CD and the Foo Fighters other 2 CDS are the best CDs in my collection and always will be.
B000000YG5|5.0|I was introduced to jazz by friends who touted Coltrane as the beginning and end of sax mastery and I almost dropped out of jazz until I came upon &quot;Sax Colussus&quot;.  I have the Prestige 50th Anniversary Special Commemorative Edition and for the record, the sound quality on this album is so rich that when you close your eyes you can almost slip back in time into the recording studio.  St. Thomas is a classic that belongs in any collection but signature pieces like &quot;Strode Rode&quot; and the ultra cool &quot;Moritat&quot; (Doug Watkins bass is great on this one [although Tommy Flanagan's piano does sound a bit &quot;subdued&quot; or &quot;muffled&quot;) make this album a gem in any sized jazz collection.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I love this CD!! Green Day is definitely one of the coolest alternative groups that there is! I knew I had to purchase this CD after hearing &quot;Minority&quot; on the radio. I was very happy that I did buy it because I found more awesome songs on it. My favorites include Minority, Fashion Victim, Warning and my current favorite song in the whole world, &quot;CASTAWAY!&quot; This is one of the most fabulous songs that I have ever heard. If you love a good alternative album then you gotta buy WARNING!
B00005JG6Q|5.0|When I saw Akira three years ago, I was at a loss to describe it to the people who asked me about it. And three years later I still am. Nearly perfect animation, wonderful plot, and mind blowing visuals that will leave you head hurting, this is Akira. This is a must have for ANY anime fan, the movie deserves to be seen in its complete DVD glory.
0446310786|1.0|In my Junior English class this year I was forced to read this Pulitzer Prize - winning novel.  First, what was the PP committee thinking?  Yes it was 1961, yes it was the Civil Rights Movement, yes a lot of people used WAY too much pot, but none of those arguments can explain why this obvious, saccharine mockery of a novel won anything, including publication rights.   I kept thinking that &quot;it has to get better&quot;, but it DOESN'T!  The characters are flat and cariacatured - everyone does exactly what a Disney-style movie would like them to do.  Because of this, there is no real definition to the characters and you can't care about them - believe me, I tried - under threat of death by English teacher.  Also the symbolism is blatant beyond belief.  She actually tells you directly what the symbols are and what they mean - defeating the whole purpose.   As bad as the first 28 or so chapters are, they are no comparison with the last 3.  I have seen and read many bad endings, but this made me throw the book across the room in anger.  If you've ever watched any of the ... movies or most any other kids movie (see the unending series of sports animal ones), you will have a rough idea of the sappiness and predictability of this conclusion.   For a high school kid, I consider myself pretty well read, and this novel hits a new low in any genre.  Kids, if your teacher pushes this on you, just remember what they taught you in DARE - &quot;Just Say No&quot;!  If you (any age) are considering this book, consider yourself warned - I couldn't be paid to read even one chapter again.   But if you REALLY like those dopey kids' movies your 3-year-old watches, this is the book for you.  Immerse yourself in the sugar of it all.
0201633612|3.0|Finally when confronted with real world problems, engineers re-discover the good all tricks: decision tables, indirection, message passing, publish and subscribe, message switching, parsing, linked lists, exploding objects into their components at implementation time to better handle versioning ... Too bad the terminology has to be so esoteric, but hey, isn't this a new world? Really?<br />It was funny to see Christofer Alexander wondering what he was doing talking to a bunch of software engineers several yeras ago. &quot;Closet architects&quot; he called them. No wonder, this business of patterns is only slowly emerging out of its programmers craddle to look into the real enterprise problems. <br />As a final note, looking at architecture for guidance from the elders may not be the wisest thing. Software is a dynamic environment, not architecture. I would rather look at mechanical engineering, electrical engineering or even try to understand how switching systems software is organized (rather than Smalltalk classes) to see what real software virtuosos have done in the past. The telephone network works. They must have done something right ...
B0000028PL|5.0|It is unfortunate that &quot;Stain&quot; was the least popular Living Colour c-d when originally released (and therefore, the least appreciated); but there is growing consensus today that &quot;Stain&quot; is their masterpiece--as much as an advance on &quot;Time's Up&quot; as that album was for &quot;Vivid.&quot;  Part of the reason maybe that the strong funk-rock fusion that was present before (&quot;Love Rears It's  Ugly Head&quot;, &quot;Elvis is Dead&quot;, etc.)is largely absent here--with the exception of &quot;WTTF&quot;--their best instrumental track.  This was  their hardest, edgiest work yet; the sheer bleakness of most of the songs dealing with alienation, indifference, hatred, insanity and persecution might have proved too &quot;heavy&quot;; and the occasional satiric song, such as &quot;Mind Your Own Business&quot;, didn't balance out the intensity the way previous recordings did.  But, the hard-edged approach is justified with the lyrics achieving a new maturity that had Living Colour getting under the skin of its disfunctional characters instead of the effective yet simplistic preaching that was characterisitc of their first two albums.  Songs like &quot;Go Away&quot;, &quot;Ignorance Is Bliss&quot;, &quot;Auslander&quot;, &quot;Never Be Satisfied&quot;, &quot;Leave It Alone&quot;, and &quot;The Postman&quot;, testify to  Living Colour's growing artistry.  Compare the earlier, similiarly themed &quot;Middle Man&quot; with the deceptively jaunty &quot;Leave It Alone&quot; or note how the lush orchestration on &quot;Nothingness&quot; underscores the song's nihilism. In fact it is only when you reach &quot;Stain's&quot; coda &quot;The Wall&quot; that Living Colour reverts back to using a more typical &quot;message&quot; song that it almost disappoints . (&quot;Time's Up&quot; final song, the haunting &quot;This Is The Life&quot; is certainly more memorable.) But, &quot;Stain&quot; is a dynamic album and contains what is Living Colour's greatest song ever--&quot;Bi.&quot;  A perfect blend of pop, r&amp;b and heavy metal, without a trace of preachiness, witty yet serious, it's light tone contributing to its provocativeness--&quot;Bi&quot; represents Living Colour at their musical and lyrical best and for that alone makes &quot;Stain&quot; a must buy.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Ok, It's really annoying that the critics slam Britney 4 this album. It's really good, IMO. Yes, some of the songs sound the same (&quot;Lucky,and &quot;Oops&quot;)(&quot;Can't make u love me&quot;,and &quot;Stronger&quot;) But overall this is a good album. I play it alot when I want 2 enjoy independent music.&quot;Stronger&quot; is my favorite track on the album. That's the reason I got it. I like every song on the album but the last 2 (&quot;When your eyes say it&quot; and &quot;Dear diary&quot;. &quot;Don't let me b the last 2 know&quot; is a wonderful song showing that she CAN sing. She never gets a chance 2 show her vocal ability cause she makes more catchy songs like &quot;Oops...I did it again&quot; and &quot;Lucky&quot;. &quot;Where r u now&quot; Is a great ballad, IMO. She shows vocal talent in that song 2.Her next album should b differen't than this 1 and &quot;..Baby 1 more time&quot; cause she's co-writing songs w/ Dido. I can't wait 4 her new album so she can show u people that she does have talent and she's more than just a blonde that can dance. She's awsome. She has a great voice when she gets the chance 2 show it. Over all, The album is a thubs ^ cause she got positive songs about getting over heart break and surviving on your own. I love this album. If u want an album w/ great songs than buy it. You'll get your $'s worth.
B000002UAR|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best albums ever made. Every song is perfect, there is no need to skip through. In my opinion this album surpasses all of the other Beatles releases, even the white album. It is that good. If you want to hear why people love the Beatles, buy this album, buy Abbey Road, and then go on from there. If you're a fan and don't have this album yet - get it. now. not later. RIGHT NOW.

B00003CXB2|5.0|I always dreamed to see this movie and when I finally saw it I was astonished. First of all the sets were magnificent and the desert was beautiful. The movie is very genius and hard to understand so I would recommend this movie to those who are movie collectors and to those who think a lot. Lawrence Of Arabia is a true epic.
0800179501|5.0|I've heard it said that psychologists have found that certain films can promote certain emotional healings. When I think back on this gem of a film, it certainly brings back a barrage of emotions. It always reminds me of those times when bullies made my school days miserable, and I felt like a weakling, unable to steer my own destiny. In &quot;The Karate Kid&quot; I found a comrade in spirit with Daniel. He fought back only when pressed from all sides, and no other avenue of escape existed. Even when faced with the &quot;no mercy&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot; methods, Daniel San still presses on -- courageous -- determined and encouraged by his mentor to do the honorable thing.  The most disappointing aspect of the movie? Only having the pan-and-scan version on the DVD. I'd think that the studios would clamor at the chance to give this film a first-class presentation. Widescreen and Dolby 5.1 would restore the quality of this wonderful film and build on the emotional crush that the film delivers... So that when Daniel faces his adversaries, and the crowd cheers him on, I can FEEL his fear and anxiety. An experience like this is only heightened by the visual and audio impact of Daniel's victory. And in that moment, as I sit immersed in that feeling.. those memories from my own life replay.... and from that comes the reminder, that like Daniel, I've ended up victorious! Man, what a movie. Can't wait to see this film with a decent treatment!
B00003CXMG|4.0|The year is 1973 and contrary to popular belief, Rock and Roll is far from dead.  Almost Famous is the story of fifteen-year-old William Miller and his journalistic journey to capture the lives of the rock group, Stillwater, for Rolling Stone magazine.  Through William's adolescent eyes, we get a behind the scenes look at a mid-level rock band and the struggles they go through as a group.<br />Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical screenplay is superb and the actors bring each and every one of his characters to life.  Frances McDormand is great as William's eccentric and over-protective mother, Elaine.  McDormand will have you laughing with her &quot;just say no to drugs&quot; speeches.  Billy Crudup portrays Stillwater's lead guitarist &quot;Russell Hammond&quot; just the way you would picture a rock star to be: cool, confident and temperamental.  Patrick Fugit also gives a good performance as the wide-eyed and innocent William, while Kate Hudson gives great energy to the worldly teen Miss Penny Lane.  <br />Almost Famous was definitely one of the best films of 2000.  There have been many movies about Rock and Roll, but Almost Famous is different.  Almost Famous humanizes rock stars and lets the viewer see what their world of drugs, sex, fame and music is all about.  If you are looking to see a movie with great acting, great music and a great script, then look no more, you've found it.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|At the Drive-In is a really cool band.  However, they are most certainly not a rap/rock band.  Of course their singer can't rap - he's not trying too.  At The Drive-In consider themselves an alternative/punk band.
B00003CWL6|4.0|'American Beauty' lacks the bite of a true satire, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect, whilst characters are undoubtedly stereotypes. The result is a film with people that are not entirely palpable, and which never really elicits strong emotions. Yet to level these criticisms is to miss the point. The characters should not be wholly believable, nor should the film be highly moving. Our reaction reflects nothing more, or less, than the sense of numbness felt by the characters. We do not care how the film ends; but nor, in reality, does anyone in the film. Mendes' masterpiece demonstrates more than anything his grounding in the theatre: he forces the audience to view the characters in exactly the same manner that other people in the film do. This is not a simple accomplishment; by so doing, he alters not just the concious but the subconcious. We end the film knowing only half of why we liked the film, only time enables the assertion of the subconscious's views of the work. It is this, more than anything, that ensures the film is worthy of repeated viewing.

B000002MUQ|5.0|Despite what people will say about Sammy Hagar in Van Halen the truth of the matter is that they put out great albums. I'm not going to say that I'm a bigger Dave fan or a bigger Sammy fan, the truth of the matter is that I'm a Van Halen fan, meaning Eddie, Alex, Mike, Dave, Sammy, or Gary. I honestly love all Van Halen there isn't one song I can say I don't like. But out of the Sammy Hagar era of the band next to 5150 Balance is the best album. First off the production on this album is a lot better than the two previous albums (For Unlwaful Carnal Knowledge and OU812). The band also sounds tighter on this album, Eddie's guitar sound is a lot better than it's been in years, Alex's drums are more solid, Mike sounds great, bass playing and his signature background vocals, and Sammy Hagar's voice is still excellent. It's just a shame that this was their last album together. For the most part the songs on Balance are straight forward hard rock. The album kicks off with The Seventh Seal, this is a great rockin track with excellent lyrics. The sugar coated semi ballad first single, Can't Stop Lovin You is next, don't let my description throw you off, it's a great song. Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do) is next, again don't let the title throw you off, this is one of Van Halen's heaviest song to date. The party rock song Amsterdam is next, once again this is another great song, the band sounds awesome. Big Fat Money is another joke song, but it's awesome, great guitar parts. Of course what would a Van Halen album be without instrumentals, there are three on Balance, Strung Out, Doin' Time, and Baluchitherium. They are all pretty good, Strung Out features Eddie playing with the strings on a piano, Strung Out is a great song with an awesome drum solo, and Baluchitherium has more of a song structure than the other ones, the band sounds great. They also have a really great ballad on this album, Not Enough is one of their best ballads ever, this ranks up there with When It's Love and Love Walks In. This song is followed by a great rocker called Aftershock, Eddie's guitar is amazing and the power in Alex's drums can't be matched by anyone. Take Me Back (deja vu) is another ballad, while Not Enough was piano based this track is based on acoustic guitar. The album ends with Feelin' this song can't really be considered a ballad but it isn't a rocker either. I can't say enough about this track, the lyrics are great, very meaningful, Sammy's voice is great, and Eddie's best solo on the album is on this song. Balance is an essential album for a Van Halen fan, it's just a shame that we never got to hear a followup to it, but either way I'm excited to hear their next album.
B000002H97|1.0|Well, I guess it's true: If you market enough t-shirts and posters you can sell anything, and Metallica proved it with this sad step into the big-time mainstream sludge of accessibility.I realize that my opinion on this is unpopular, everyone under the age of 20 loves this album. Perhaps they missed the better days of Metallica when the band welded their complexity and stylistic integrity into the minds of an angry generation. Metallica, at one time, gave us a powerful and unstoppable sound that you could feel in your guts. Then they decided that they just wanted to sell records, and as cliche and stupidly rock-egoish as it may sound, I declare, ladies and gentlemen, this band SOLD-OUT!       They are, in fact, quite the definition of selling out. Beginning with the obvious cheese gimmicks of their self-entitled album, such as deeming it the &quot;Black&quot; album and churning out accessible ballads and clean-cut radio-freindly productions, put this album up against any of the band's earlier releases, and you know what? It's not even the same band. They should have changed their name. With this &quot;black&quot; album we see a truly unique band (even among its metal contemperaries) turn into another slice of the same old stale bread, slowly contributing to the death of what so many of us love about music.            Fifteen years old, and I'm off to the record store nine miles away with rolling electricity in my stomach. I've got a twenty dollar bill in my pocket that I somehow attained, and I'm imagining just how cool the new Metallica album is going to be. After seeing the &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; video on headbangers ball over and over, and weeks of anticipation, It's finally here! Man, I just couldn't wait.I remember finally getting to the record store, and in a grand display the dark cover of the album was plastered from wall to wall. I grabbed my copy, threw my wadded twenty on the counter and headed home.          Having been a devoted Metallica fan for some time, I had an image in my head of what the album would be like. It's black cover and already magnificent reputation, however, began to seem misleading when I tore the CD open and began to read the lyrics. &quot;shape-shift, run through the wind, move swift...&quot;? What, are they saying they're werewolves or something? Oh well, it's Metallica! I'm sure it's cool. Of course it's cool...          Arriving home, I quickly inserted the disc into my very early nineties CD player, skipped the first, already played out track &quot;Sandman&quot;, turned the volume up to some obscene level, and began to experience one of life's bigger disappoinments. I tried, I really did, to love the album as much as I had loved &quot;Puppets&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot;. But as the album went on there was just no hope for it. I mean, &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; sounded like it was a Cowardly Lion (&quot;If I were king of the foreeeest&quot;) rip-off. &quot;Don't Tread on Me&quot; was as confusing lyricly as it was stale and boring musicly. &quot;Of Wolf and Man&quot; was just plain stupid, and &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; sounded like another version of &quot;Don't Tread...&quot;.                      My freinds called, and I told them the album was great. I lived in a complete state of denial for a few days, trying desparately to pry the awesomeness out of the album. I was sure that it just had to grow on me. Within a few weeks the CD had filtered its way into the corner of my room, dusty and scratched, ignored. I remember finding it there and finally admitting to myself &quot;This album sucks...&quot;.                   Sometime later, I began to notice people at my school wearing Metallica t-shirts who shouldn't be wearing Metallica t-shirts. The kind of people who actually would wear that same Metallica t-shirt to a Metallica concert, declaring that they were fans and displaying their t-shirt like some kind of badge admitting them into the universe of cool. The kind of peoplewho only a year earlier were blabbing on about how awesome Vanilla Ice was. It was around then that I began to understand what Metallica was doing. They were a sensation. They had manufactured, through ingenious marketing, what was perhaps what they always wanted...to be another slice of stale bread. It doesn't taste good, but it sells like mad as long as the package catches the eye of your run of the mill teen, scanning the landscape for some rebellious scrappings that will scare their parents and prop them up another rung on the ladder of image...which is exactly what this album did, and was.
6302759110|5.0|This movie follows in the footsteps of great love stories such as Romeo and Juliet. Filled with gallons of blood, this movie bring a suitable amount of gore to this classic love story. There is a certain amount of over acting and some dodgy english accents from Winona Ryder and especially Keanu Reeves, but if you can look past those you have a wonderful gothic horror/romance that will transcend time.
055352626X|5.0|I loved it!!  I listened while driving to and from work.  At times, I was laughing so hard that I had to pull over.  So many of the tales hit me personally.  Prepare to laugh and to empathize!!
B00003CXPD|5.0|Myself and my wife rented this on DVD this weekend, and we were pleasantly surprised. After all the media's mixed opinions on this movie, it was good to sit down and actually see for ourselves what all the hype(good, bad or otherwise) was about. The only other Brit movie we saw this year was the godawful MAYBE BABY, wrongly marketed as comedy. However, BILLY ELLIOT is billed as drama and is often wittier than you think! The subject matter of a young boy becoming a ballet dancer sounded odd and done-before, but it certainly works here! Set in 1984, with the coal miner's strike as a backdrop, young Billy's interest in ballet dancing causes family friction in a macho-male dominated society of the 1980s Britain. His dance teacher, brilliantly played by Julie Walters, encourgaes him to develop his skills and audition for the Royal Ballet School in London. However, his family are not well off - his father and brother are actively involved in the miner's strike with union activity and things come to a head when Billy's brother is arrested for rioting. Those scenes brought back some memories of that time - the retro settings are just great and the musical soundtrack, featuring T-Rex, The Jam, The Clash and assorted classical pieces is interesting(great songs during end credit roll by Stephen Gately and Eagle Eye Cherry too!) and works well with the film's best moments. Jamie Bell is superb as Billy, and his aggressive dancing through the streets scene is a gem, and the message of this dramatic and sometimes amusing movie is that one can overcome all obstacles and achieve their dreams if they persevere! Don't miss it.
B00005ATQD|5.0|Eyes Wide Shut is the most realistic movie ever made. The major problems of marriage as well as between men and women potrayed in Mr. Kubrick's masterpiece were so true. One of my friends visited me during I was watching the movie on DVD, and we talked about his crisis that his present-girlfriend called him when he was having dinner with his ex-girlfriend. Of course, my friend told his present-girlfriend that he was accompanied by his mother. I said to him maybe his girlfriend was unfaithful too. He replied determinedly, &quot;No, definitely not. she is a good girl.&quot; 20 minutes after I saw the argument between Cruise and Kidman, the everlasting problem popped out in front of my eyes, in our mortal world. Never had I seen a movie so close to real life, and I was left wordless, yet so excited. I have heard people saying hoe crappy Eyes Wide Shut is. I can simply say they are pathetic, for they lack one of the most wonderful traits given to human beings--appreciating art, and they are not even willing to spend two minutes thinking about the meaning of the film.                         What I have to mention is the score of Eyes Wide Shut was purely fascinating. Shostakovich's Jazz Waltz 2 echoed throughout my mind for over a week after I saw the movie. I watched the movie with my mom and she enjoyed it a lot, which also made her think about her &quot;life&quot;. <br />      I saw Eyes Wide Shut in Taiwan so luckily I got the uncensored version. The additional scenes were just more nudes in action, which did not add anything to the story. I did not realized the fact until I bought the DVD in Canada, when I found certain scenes were missing. Well, I can only say that don't get too fussy about those scenes since they didn't affect the perfect story. <br />       To people who hate the movie: Grow up, please.
078322706X|4.0|This is a charming, intelligent and visually elegant film that is far more deserving than the somewhat harsh treatment that it received from critics.<br />   Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of the mogul Bill Parrish is a study in how an elite actor can take a superior script and create a character with dignity and richness beyond what the writers could have envisioned.  Despite the unbelievability in such a worldly figure maintaining the idealism that Parrish has, it is easily forgiven, because the focus is on the quality of the fated man's interactions rather than on his stature.<br />   Claire Forlani gives a graceful and expressive performance as the daughter in a role that highlights the persistence of feminine vulnerability even in the contemporary world of high-achieving women.<br />   The real star of the film, truth be told, though, is Pitt, whose tremendously charismatic presence is always the centerpiece of attention.  His is a confused Reaper, but at times a grim one nevertheless, and it's an unnerving moment when this boyish actor becomes stern enough to convey fear to the Hopkins character.<br />   Not the least, it should be said, of the film's pleasures are the beautiful and elaborate sets and locations.<br />   Most of all, though, throughout its entire length, the dignity of and compassion for all the characters is maintained, the hallmark of all good entertainment.  For someone who frankly does not like many movies, this was a refreshing and very recommendable experience.
0061020710|5.0|On the back of a giant space turtle stand four giant elephants, together they support the Disc World.  This book mixes together a failed wizard called Rincewind, an innocent tourist with four eyes called Twoflower and his many legged sapient pearwood luggage that has a mind of it's own!  It follows the mishaps as Rincewind is hired to show the tourist around the capital Ankh-Morpork... the more dangerous the situation the more he likes it!  Look out for DEATH on his white charger called Binky!!  A must to read, and REALLY funny... it's addictive and before you know it you'll have bought all 26 Disc World series and all the other merchandise you can lay your hands on!!  Good luck and good reading!
B00003CXQY|5.0|After recent Disney releases, this is really a great, new, and original movie!  Disney has lately been going down-hill, what with all of the sequels they have made that don't even measure up to the originals.  This was one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen!  Not just for kids, adult humor makes it great for everyone!  I completely and totally recommend this movie.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|To call AKIRA anime is a crime.  This is NOT anime, but the most realistic animated movie ever made.  It is a testament to the animation art form.  Just watching the movie, you will be engrossed by its awe.  I recommend watching this movie in the original Japanese.  There is not a single American dub that does the characters justice.  This new DVD will give you that opportunity.  AKIRA is a very complex and beautiful story and a must have for any DVD collection.
0790730960|5.0|This movie is what I call my &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;.  The acting isn't the greatest, but it's just one of those awesome movies with great visual effects, an unusual plot, brilliant musical score, and just full of action.  The score to the film comes through loud and clear on this DVD edition.  And the art direction is much easier to appreciate.  I'm sure everyone has a place in their heart for superhero movies, but this is one of the all-time greatest of any superhero movie.  The Academy Award nominated make-up artists made Danny DeVito one of the best, and realistic villians in the history of cinema.  And let's face it, Michael Keaton is the original Batman!
B000001Y2U|5.0|I started out listening to ACS with an open mind, and lets face it to listen to Manson you need to have one.  I must say I was totally blown away with this album, the whole thing from start to finish is a true master piece.  To me this album is almost like a second bible, a dark bible, every song telling a story and also sending out a message to the world.  I have full respect for Manson as to create and perform an album of this quality is truly amazing.  Songs that stick out of the pack are the awesomley powerful Reflecting God, the superb antichrist superstar with its evil and brilliant music and lyrics and finally the most emotion numbing track that i have ever heard Man that you Fear.  If you want to listen to something different and you're not a christian then this is a must purchase.  I have no regrets whatsoever about purchasing this album and it really is truly out of this world.
B00003TL18|5.0|I purchased this DVD because i was electrified by the PBS showing, and the DVD was worth the price to see it many times again, with the bonus of the extras.  But the main attraction to multiple viewings is the concert itself that makes you feel like you're privileged to view it, and makes you feel like you missed one of those rare, special &quot;live&quot; moments where everyone is real.  <br />It seems like all the performing and technical artists involved realized early on that a window of unique opportunity to do something wonderful was being given to them by a commercial platform that just happened to come along.<br />Wow. To see Elvis Costello, k.d. lang, Bonnie Raitt, and Tom Waits playing anonymous, non-descript back-up, pure...in just...Being There.  Being There pure along with a young Bruce Springsteen as the acolyte to the Master, who he was, actually, at the time of the concert's recording.  We experience Bruce striving to his best, consciously realizing before our eyes, in all his nervous insecure intensity, Roy's largess in bestowing room for him to shine in what is clearly Roy the Master's spotlight.  We feel Art, Humanity, as it is meant to be, is happening.  <br />Call me a nyophyte innocent while I call myself an old dog who refuses to fold into cynicism despite 50 plus lifeyears experience to the contrary, but this concert gave me a thrill of what it is to feel on the top of one's profession, of one's life.  I'm convinced Roy Orbison felt all of that in this concert, and felt the respect and recognition of his peers and heirs.  And I came away from the DVD feeling that even for the reserved man who was Roy Orbison, he knew he was lucky to share in the celebration of his life through the collaborative performance of his art while he was still alive to feel it.
B00000IPAX|5.0|There is only one song on here that is punk. The Party Song. A pretty good song but it's too fast. I will rate each song as I usually don't do.<br />1. Dumpweed: A pretty good song. Good riffs and stuff. Nice drumming. Some cusses but not as much as Dysentary Gary.<br />2. Don't leave me: A good song with good drumming. Okayish guitars. Cool lyrics.<br />3. Aliens Exist: Awesome song when it gets around 2:10. Good guitars and vocals.<br />4. Going away to colege: This used to be my favorite song on here. Now I'm not sure what is my favorite.... A GREAT song! One of the best on here!<br />5. What's my age again: I've heard this so many times that it's not funny. I am still not tired of it. Great song with funny lyrics. <br />6. Dysentary Gary: Cool song. Lots of cusses and discrimination against girls. Good song though.<br />7. Adam's Song: Now we are talking! This song is great! If you can't figure what this song is about then listen to it really carefully! &quot;I traced the cord back to the wall, no wonder it was never plugged in at all.&quot; That's kind of obvious. Figure it out.<br />8. All the small things: An average song. Not great but good enough to help make this CD a 5 star rating.<br />9. The Party Song: Nah! This isn't good. They need more effort in this song.<br />10. Mutt: Cool and funny song! This whole CD has funny lyrics except for Adams's Song. <br />11. Wendy Clear: Now I remember! This is my favorite song. Great song with cool guitars and riffs and lyrics and drumms and... everything!<br />12. Anthem: I am actually listening to this now. It's not bad. Acutally, it's pretty good! Nice lyrics and effort!<br />So this CD earns 5 stars because every song (in my oponion) is good except for The Party Song. Now, if you are a fan of Blink 182's old stuff, then you might want to reconsider this album. It's not quite punk but (in my oponion) it's better than punk. I like this album for its diverstiy from the other Blink 182 albums. A good buy and worth every haypenny (a half of a penny).
B000035Z1Z|5.0|I enjoyed this movie thouroughly!  I like it, my daughter likes it, my Mom likes it.  Meg Ryan is funny and charming throughout and the chemistry between Ryan and Kevin Klein is great.  There are some great scenes of France, fun music, clever dialogue.  I think this is one of Meg Ryan's best movies.
B00003CXE6|4.0|The movie Gladiator is a good one and has a good plot. It is about a roman general who was about to become emporer when the emperor's son killed the emperor and attempts to kill Russel Crowe(The roman general Maximus) Maximus then becomes enslaved after his family is crusified. He becomes a gladiator for his owner Proximus and earns his way to the Collesium by defeating everone in his path. I won't tell you the rest. The movie has a good plot and keeps you on your toes. The battle scenes are great and so are the backstabbing liars in this movie. The battle scenes are also very gory and bloddy. Many people have their heads cut off and you can see their heads laying on the ground. So its a bit gross for your kids. The one thing I did not care for was some of the actors. I believe that some actors could have done a better part. Russel, old Caesar, and the slaves do well acting but some other actors do not. I watched this movie on VHS and its sound and picture was ok. Although watching this on DVD would be a lot better. This is another reason I rated it four stars. It was hard to hear and understand some conversations. All-in-all I would reccomend that you go and rent the movie first and than buy it because with this movie, you either hated it or you loved it. There was no middle.
0451169514|5.0|S.K's IT is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I love the way S.K. goes from character to character, from teenage years back to present day. Sometimes its hard to tell what's what but it makes everything flow that much better, and you grow to love and care for each character. Billy, the wise, gifted writer and leader of the group, Stan is soft hearted and slightly wimpy, Richie with all his voices adds laughter and humor to the tale, Eddie with his powerful inhaler or battery acid who is strong mentally even if he isn't strong physically, Mike who looks out for everyone and adds color to the group in more ways than one, Beverly with her beauty and strength, and finally Ben whos weight never gets him down. The 7 become a kind of magical circle of power, a witches coven of sorts that fight IT as children and later as adults. Only children can really see IT, with its horror, its blood splattering terror, and its orange pom poms. As a child I was always afraid of clowns, and reading this story it brings the terror back and throws it in my face. This is a great book, I recommend it for someone with a tough stomach as with all S.K's books. He isn't afraid of a little carnage. Everytime I read another of his books, I find myself filling up with more ideas for my own books, like a ballon about to pop. If I ever make it out to the word of writing, S.K. will defintely be one of my major role models. I plead with you to read this book, its 1000 or so pages only took me a week or two to read, and only because I had work and school and I had to eat and sleep sometime. READ!!!!!! :)
6302467861|1.0|I was hoping for the original animated classic and this is just pictures from the book and Dustin Hoffman reading the story. I have the book and I can read the book! I wanted to see those nasty monkeys and hear the songs! My son loves them. The description I read didn't really let on that this wasn't the original. I was very disapointed.
0800177177|4.0|Anyone hoping to make it in the world of filmmaking would do well to look at the works of Francis Ford Coppola (well, his earlier works, anyway).  &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula,&quot; is certainly no exception, though I feel I should point out a few negative aspects.  First, the film is great when viewed as a living work of art; Coppola uses every cinematic trick in the book to bring the world of the Count to life, and does so with exceptional flair.  However, as an adaptation of Mr. Stoker's famous novel, it fails in many places.  For instance, not once in the novel does Stoker make a direct reference to Walachian ruler Vlad Dracula (or Vlad Tepes - the Impaler), nor does he ever make it clear why Dracula chose the dark path he has walked for centuries.  In the film, it is said that Dracula renounced God upon learning of his wife's suicide, and vowed to live for all time until she could be avenged - thus becoming an all-powerful vampire.  This is certainly a touching addition, and the film does not truly suffer from it.  In fact, the film does not suffer from any of the inaccuracies within.  No, the film is certainly great, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Dracula, vampires in general, or Francis Ford Coppola.  The biggest problem had nothing to do with the novel, but a performace - Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker.  I still cannot fathom why Coppola allowed such a stiff, monotone actor to take on the role of such a vital character.  His inclusion is a dark blot on an otherwise beautiful portrait. The other actors are all quite exceptional, especially Gary Oldman as the Count and Anthony Hopkins as Abraham Van Helsing.  The good out-weighs the bad, as one can plainly see; &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot; would certainly make a fine addition to anyone's DVD collection.
B000056NX5|5.0|I have now watched this version of JCS 10 times. I've heard the music many times and recall seeing the first movie version. This updated version spoke to me much more. Not sure that it's because I'm now in my late 30's and have more insight to draw from. <br />I love the Palm Sunday scene...kudos to Glenn Carter and the successful affect of the stage lighting to make it an inspiring segment.  The joy and boundless unconditional love of Carter's Jesus is breathtaking.<br />I really took in the concept of those characters who did the &quot;will of God&quot;, some whole heartedly and others did it although they did so kicking and screaming. (both Pilot and Judas realize they are being drugged into a situation they don't want to be in...the persecution of an innocent man).  It brings up a point that so many have missed over the centuries...the Jews, Judas, Pilot and Herrod were all carrying out God's will whether they realized it or not. There is really no one to be angry at for Christ's death.<br />This seems so basic yet in these times where white supremists still are trying to indoctrinate others  to hate (all in the name of how Christ died) it is a good message to drive home.<br />And when Christ does die on the cross, it is very moving and brings it all to life in a way that can't help but put a lump in the throat the most callous view<br />I DO HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS PRODUCTION:<br />I realize that they were trying to show the human side of Jesus and thus there are lots of anger and tears shown by Carter;s Jesus.  I could appreciate it all except for when Pilot hands down the order for Jesus to die. Carter's Jesus kneels down and cries like a baby.  It is way over the top, especially considering that he is angry or crying or both through 65% or more of the movie.<br />Also, I could understand why his mother, Mary was not part of the movie. Afterall, the movie focus's on other characters. I found myself feeling angered though at the end when Christ was dyingon the cross and he cries out...&quot;Where is my mother?&quot; What was Gale Edwards trying to accomplish by this? If they are going to tell the story of it all, the fact is that his mother was there when he died.<br />I'm going to assume that it was all for a theatrical statement that he felt abandoned by his mother because she couldn't protect him from this.<br />And last...I know that not showing the ressurrection had thematic reasons behind it. However, it was an empty experience to not see his ressurection. I think that it would have brought great closure. Jesus would finally be seen not suffering and thus it would answer the question of whether all the aganony witnessed most of the movie was worth it or not. And it would have brought resolution to what he was trying to explain to his followers of what true glory is.<br />I'm not a bible thumper...but I am spiritual and I think although it's all thought provoking and the music is wonderful, it is lacking in some areas.
B000002V0Q|5.0|This is the best album that Megdeth ever recorded, with &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; a close second.  &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; features incredible songs woven together into a beautiful tapestry.  No song can be called &quot;filler,&quot; and the overall weakest song on this album is &quot;Psychotron,&quot; which is repetitive but not at all bad.<br />The best songs are the first 4 (&quot;Skin O' My Teeth,&quot; &quot;Symphony of Destruction,&quot; &quot;Architecture of Aggression,&quot; and &quot;Foreclosure of a Dream&quot;), which all feature poignant lyrics and killer riffs.  On that best list, we have &quot;This Was My Life,&quot; &quot;Countdown to Extinction,&quot; &quot;Captive Honor,&quot; and &quot;Ashes in Your Mouth.&quot;  Nick Menza flexes his forearms as he punishes his drums for not being loud enough.  Marty and Dave make a great guitar tandem--Megadeth's place in history is assured all because of a genius we call Dave Mustaine.  David Ellefson's bass, when you can hear it, is awesome and rounds out the songs perfectly, but the producers of the album did somewhat better than the group that did Metallica's &quot;Justice.&quot;<br />All in all, this is a masterpiece, and far better than the Metallica album that came out at nearly the same time--accursed &quot;Black.&quot;
B000002H6C|5.0|I love Metallica.  From slow ballads to crunching rhythums they rule it all!  I think Hammetts most technical soloing is on this album. I love it because I'm a guitarist and the songs keep me busy.  Fast drums, fast guitar, not very good bass...Dissapointing.... Metallica knows Jason Newsted [stinks] so they turn down his bass!<br />If you like this check out Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Kill Em' All, Cliff Burton is on those!!!!  (Metallica's best albums..Load and Reload are terrible and the Black Album is so so...)
0790749998|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time!!!! It has great actors, stunts and story. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone that likes action and kung fu movies. Jet Li rules in this movie and so does Aaliyah!!!!!
6300185249|5.0|&quot;The Money Pit&quot; may have been a disaster at the box office and with critics at the time but this movie is just too hilarious. This is one of the few movies that makes me laugh until tears starts rolling down my face. My personal favorite moment is when Shelly Long finds a raccoon in the dumb waiter and it leaps at her. Seeing her running around screaming with a raccoon on her shoulder is hysterical. Of course just watching Tom Hanks' character try to fix the house is equally funny, particularly when he hears Shelly's character screaming and he runs...or tries to run up the poorly built staircase. The classic moment is when he falls into that hole and is stuck there for most of the day, missing out on an important meeting with a contractor and then seeing Shelly Long's expression when she finds him stuck in the hole. &quot;The Money Pit&quot; remains one of my top favorite comedies of all time as well as favorite Tom Hanks film.
0451196716|5.0|I read this book close to a year ago, and there is not a day that goes by since then that I do not think about some aspect of it.  This is probabaly the scariest book I have ever read in my life, not because of the content of the book, but the actual idea.  The fact that people would actually march to their deaths in hopes of getting whatever they want for the rest of their lives.  Here's the scary part: there are people in the world who would actually do this.  It is not that different from &quot;Survivor&quot;, it is the same idea.  Who knows that people on &quot;Survivor&quot;wouldn't risk their lives if the prize was just a lot better?  Besides being scary in that &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;Running Man&quot; way, there are also amazing characters(I absolutely love Peter McVries, I cried because of him), and so many little philosophies in this story that make it so much more than a horror book.  There are so many, I couldn't even name them all, but those who have read it know what I'm talking about.  One example I can think of is when one of the characters compares the Long Walk to when people used to watch christians get killed by lions in the Colliseum in Roman Times.  This is truly an amazing book, Stephen King is truly an amazing author, much more than just a horror writer, he's not the world's better selling author for nothing.  Read this book!
6304466498|5.0|&quot;Spaceballs&quot; is another movie that makes me laugh until tears starts streaming down my face. The late John Candy is hilarious as Barf, half-man, half dog, as he says in the film &quot;I'm my own best friend&quot;. Joan Rivers is just as funny as the voice for the robot Spot, a female take on C-3PO. I loved the virgin alarm. Daphne Zuniga (pre-Melrose Place) and Bill Pullman are just as great to watch in this hysterical spoof on &quot;Star Wars&quot; however Rick Moranis is my favorite as Dark Helmet. His character is such a dork it is too funny. Not the brightest light bulb in the group of morons. I can't really pick a favorite scene because I think every scene is truly memorable even if the film is a bit schlocky at times. I can only enjoy this movie on tape as opposed to on tv, since tv censors a couple of hilarious lines which annoys the  heck out of me. &quot;Spaceballs&quot; is certainly no satire like &quot;Spinal Tap&quot; was but it is a spoof and an enjoyable spoof it is.
6302548195|5.0|I know that many people are looking for this video.  If Warner Studios receives letters then they may be persuaded to release tis video in limited quantities (it has happedned before with other titles). Write those Emails!!
B0000025ZF|5.0|This album started it all Waters post Floyd carrer.  A strange album without a doubt.  Acording to roger the entire album is pretty much about sex.  Well that's as may be but it's only the scratch off.  Everyone knows Roger had more to say as he showed in life performances... What I wouldn't give to go back and see one.  One of the best elements is the heartwrenching emotion and feeling of reality felt throuout the album.  This comes to a height in &quot;Gone Fishing&quot; you feel the mans pain and can relate.  Buy the album and be prepared for a bizzar and exellent musical exsperence.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I am in agreement with most of the other reviews, this CD rules.  I really enjoy the new depth to Rammstein's songs compared to the older CDs.  Sonne, Mein Herz Brennt, and all the others are just wonderful.  Unfortunatly I have yet to purchase the actual CD but believe me I WILL!
B0000027I6|5.0|This is the perfect example of Rogers biting politicly powerful lyrics.  His best lyrics since &quot;The Wall&quot; the storline is basicly an alien anthropologist giving a view of the world... and of course Roger nails it as being pretty bleak if people keep up the way thet have been.  His usual powerful anti-war messege and the sadness that the media presents it as enertainment.  Many won't like this album becasue of the cynical view of humanity well they need to wake up and take a look around.  Some of the best on this album are both parts of &quot;What God Wants&quot; they are in fact giving what many people are trying to sell as God... and of course they're all wrong.  Roger uses a tele-evangelist voice over to drive the point home. &quot;Watching T.V.&quot; is a great and very sad story about the Tiananmen Square massacre. The best song all and all however is &quot;The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range&quot; a great rocker and story about sittig back and watching the missles fall.  The album ends in power and an uplifting note with &quot;Amused To Death&quot; the choral work will bring chills to your spine.
0792842723|2.0|I am one of Bond's biggest fans so I can't really believe the rating I'm giving this movie. It all started when one of my friends said this was the best movie ever. I went right away and bought it, and boy was I dissapointed. The only good part was Tina Turner's song. Another bad thing was having Xenia in there. All she does is a bunch of sick noises, etc. The plot also really stunk. Either rent, or just don't see it at all.
B00005AUBA|5.0|This Mogwai album came from the point when they heard Radiohead's Kid A (it was, really).  This album is purely what Mogwai has wanted to be, and what they are.  They show us in this album that they can compare to any one that's popular and critically acclaimed, which Mogwai has been for the past two years.  But in this album, Rock Action (which has just been written up in Spin) is pure genius.<br />Mogwai really shows us what they can do here.  I praise them for creating an album that shows what they can be, and what they are while still mantaining a crisp sound that is suitable for the world's ears.<br />I'm excited to see where this album goes and where it takes Mogwai.  I think that I'd compare this album (if any thing,  because it is quite unique) to Godspeed You Black Emperor! only because of a couple of the songs sound VERY similar while still maintaing a great Mogwai sound.
014100018X|5.0|I must admit, I picked up this book with a few reservations. The book, however, turned out to be one of the best books I've read in a long itme!! Vianne Roche (IS she a witch?) breezes into town one day on the tails of carnival and sets up shop across from the local church, to the dismay of the local priest. This book has just the right amount of tension between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;. Seldom has a book evoked such emotion. At times laughing out loud and unashamedly crying, I could not put the book down until the very last page. The characters are wonderfully portrayed, the plot is well-thought out and the book itself is beautifully written. A delight to read! If the movie follows the book, it should be a box office hit. I highly recommend this book to anyone! Delicious!!
B00004RHZU|5.0|This is Pink's first ever album and it's a surprising one. In this CD you will find pop that is dominating the airwaves as we speak, but she also offers some gems that are very rare. I don't care what any body says, There You Go is the best female song since Brandy &amp; Monica's The Boy is Mine. Catch a listen to it and you won't get it outta your head.. it's catchy stuff. Is it Love is R&amp;B soul ballad at its best with lyrics you got to hear to believe (let's just say Pink gave something sacred up to a boy she loved and can never get it back). But besides There You Go which I don't think anybody hates, and Is it Love, there is Love is Such a Crazy Thing. Which is a medium paced soul shaker which will stick out like a sore thumb on the attitude and anger so many of her songs express. Its a soft and silky song, I know this sounds so corny but I can't find the words. Really its an amazing song that even without the 3 Top 10 hits on here would make it worth it. Did you also know Pink is white? Hard to believe but its the truth.
052594527X|4.0|Enjoyable.  Eloquent.  A thoroughly enjoyable read.  Griet is a girl with values.  Knows her place but does what is necessary for her family. Well-developed characters.  Some you love to hate.  Tracy Chevalier's description of everyday life back in the late 1600's is as clear as if she were there. Is this the true story behind Vermeer's painting of the same name?  Whatever your age, it's an enjoyable novel.
0786915749|5.0|because of this book i now realize how much i enjoy reading. reading the next books just seem to increase the greatness of the first.
B00004XONN|4.0|You have to give Radiohead some credit for coming back with something different - experimental,  Of course experimental doesn't always work, and, in this case perhaps the music isn't all that revolutionary - been done before etc. etc. <br />But I like it<br />Most of it anyway.<br />I can't listen to this cd without pressing the skip track button on my CD player a few times, as I never had to do with Radiohead's bends + OK Computer. So...well it IS good, but not that good, and you DO need to be in the right mood for it, whereas I can listen to the Bends or OK Computer any mood,time or place.<br />TRack one is very good, track 2 is ok(at times) - for some reason it makes me think of sheep!<br />I love the punky bass line on the nAtional ANthem, but the whole thing just goes on and on so I normally skip part of that to get to the wonderful How To Disappear Completely And Never Be Found - which is sad but beautiful(check the weird strings near the end).<br />Treefingers - NO WAY. How can this be deemed a track?!. Skip button there<br />Track 6 is good, excellent even...track 7...ok...but something's missing<br />idioteque - I love this. Even one of teenybopping friends does (NOt that it's pop song). Excellent beat and frantic lyrics.<br />Morning bell is pretty good, yeh I like this and then there no 10, which is all cosy and hushed and weird and also sad. I like it - but its really sad. <br />So there are loads of good points, but no real feeling of 'this is amazing, another classic', not for me anyway. Ok computer WAs a big act to follow and I think this is a fair sequel, but nothing more.
B00000BKE0|5.0|Ok people whats going on here, this is great Maiden, you people who say Jannick isnt a good guitarist without great riffs need to learn how to play a guitar, cause he is bad to the bone, this album is great, all 10 tracks rock, its just more raw and wild, but is still great maiden material, Jannick Gers is just as a good guitar player as Adrian Smith if not better, he's just alot wilder, but Dave Murray is the leader of the bunch, but Maiden fans, dont waist ur time this cd rocks buy it now, true talent and high quality metal.  Up the Irons!!!
0788811355|4.0|I understand everyone's &quot;sighs&quot; and &quot;ho-hums&quot; for this film. After all, I didn't even hear of THE ENGLISH PATIENT in the theaters when it came out in 1996. (I didn't hear of SHINE, either.) But, when the awards were handed out, this unknown film had swept 9 of its 12 nominations.<br />Director Anthony Minghella has created an epic David Lean-style film worthy of its awards. Lean was known for creating such epic films as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, A PASSAGE TO INDIA, and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO; Minghella, not known for many epic films, has brought back that Lean-esque feeling to films again. From the dark cinematography by John Seale to the haunting score by Gabriel Yared, THE ENGLISH PATIENT is a moody, beautiful, if overlong (162 mins.), piece of art that should be treasured.<br />Based on the 1992 bestselling novel by Michael Ondaatje, the film is about love, loss, and betrayal during World War II North Africa and Europe. When a mysterious stranger, played by the sometimes-unrecogizable Ralph Fiennes (Best Actor nominee, is found alive after a horrible plane crash, he is taken into care by a kindly Canadian nurse named Hana, played by Juliette Binoche. Hana is emotionally scarred by the war and agrees to take care of the stranger in Italy. The stranger in question is Count Almasy, a Hungarian -- though mistakened for English. (Hence the title!) He confides in her of a time when he was in an adulterous affair with a beautiful woman named Katharine Clifton, played by Kristin Scott Thomas (Best Actress nominee). They meet on an expedition in the Sahara in 1939, years before his plane crash. She is married to Geoffrey Clifton, played by Colin Firth, who doesn't know of her infidelity until much later, causing him to attempt a triple suicide by flying his biplane into Almasy, killing himself instead and leaving Katharine critically wounded (and eventually dying in a cave). Meanwhile, Hana meets some friends. Kip, played by Naveen Andrews, is an Indian bomb disposer; and David Caravaggio, played by Willem Dafoe, as a Canadian thief who has a terrible past with Almasy (it involves him losing his thumbs!). Eventaully, all secrets are revealed and lives are destroyed. Soon, the war ends and Almasy dies; Hana and Caravaggio leave Italy, and the rest is epic history. And, the first Best Picture winner for Miramax Films, my future co-partners in my epic film, PRISONER OF WAR.<br />Winner of 9 Academy Awards including: Best Picture - Saul Zaentz, producer; Best Director - Anthony Minghella, who was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay; Best Supporting Actress - Juliette Binoche; Best Cinematography; Best Art Direction/Set Decoration; Best Costume Design; Best Sound; Best Film Editing; and Best Score.<br />The epic genre has returned!
B000001DYA|5.0|Some groups' debut albums are straight from the garage: Raw, gritty, unrestrained, and yet to be tamed by success. Aerosmith's debut album was that way, as was Velvet Underground's, and The Stooges'. This debut album by Blue Cheer, called &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; (Latin for &quot;Controlled Chaos&quot;--or in this case, lack thereof!) defintely fits that mold. The producer simply flipped the switch and let'em bang out the tunes as hard and as crude as they wanted to--possibly in one take! A lot of the &quot;Blue Cheer sound&quot; was in the equipment they used and the way they used, or abused, it. Certainly, what strikes me the most on this album is the guitar playing of Leigh Stephens. He was to the &quot;whammy bar&quot; what Stooges' guitarist Ron Asheton was to the &quot;wah-wah pedal&quot;. When describing the Stooges' first album, one critic called Asheton the bands' &quot;wah-wah pedaler&quot;. I will thus refer to Leigh Stephens here as this bands' &quot;vibrator&quot;. His specialty was to find more ways to use and abuse one part of a guitar more than anyone else ever thought about doing, and that &quot;whammy bar&quot; was his toy on this album! Another thing about Stephens' playing is that it doesn't sound like he used a whole lot of Fuzztone. he just had his Marshall amp cranked, and when he played rhythm, you could tell he was hitting the strings hard to get natural amp distortion (unlike, say, Tony Iommi or Leslie West, who didn't hit the strings as hard, but it came out hard, because of the Fuzztone.) Leigh Stephens guitar solos are a little better than Ron Asheton's, but then he decides to overdub his solos with some completely off-kilter solos on a few songs like &quot;Out of Focus&quot;, &quot;Doctor Please&quot;, and &quot;Second Time Around&quot;, and the way he overdubs them, it comes out sounding like an all-out, sonic blitzkrieg assault!! Far from the &quot;Controlled Chaos&quot; the album title promised! Then there is the drummer, Paul Whaley--one of the few American drummers of his day to own a double-drum kit--with his drum sticks all nicely filed down for a blunter sound, and his bass drums exposed!!(no pillows, no cover, no nothin'--just microphones. If you saw the photo of them on stage on the inside sleeve of their second album, &quot;Outside/Inside&quot;, then you'll see what I mean.) If there is a weak link to all of this, perhaps it's Dickie Petersen--only there because every power trio needs a singing bass player. And when it comes singing bass players, Jack Bruce, he ain't. But, hey. At least he could write songs! And, of course, on the liner credits, the 'props' going to &quot;Jim Marshall Ltd. of London, for the amplification.&quot; And there you have it. But I can't say enough guitarist Leigh Stephens, the real standout musician here. He wasn't the most gifted guitarist in the world, but he was unique. It's a shame he gave up rock music altogether after Blue Cheer's second album (because, as he said, &quot;It was getting too violent&quot;--yeah, right. As if he didn't have a lot to do with that!!). His &quot;New Improved&quot;, more technically-proficient replacement on guitar, Randy Holden ended up having some kind of guitar-virtuoso career after Blue Cheer-however, not on the same level with a Jeff Beck or a Steve Vai.  Blue Cheer was originally from Boston, but I think they would have thrived better in a place like Detroit, than in San Fransisco. Their brand of anarchic, heavy-blues with an attitude would have been better appreciated in the &quot;Motor City&quot; that spawned the likes of Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent, Iggy Pop, MC5, and Grand Funk Railroad. I think San Fransisco mellowed them out, and made them too much like the Grateful Dead. And hiring laid-back, native Friscoids to replace original members only made things worse (of course, Frisco has come a long way since then, with the likes of Metallica.) But I digress.

B000002J1B|5.0|At first, I had just about given up on Yes, do to my dissapointment with the vastly overrated &quot;Close To The Edge&quot;. At first listen, Relayer sounded like a bunch of noise, but after a few more listens (at night to be exact), I totally fell in love with Relayer. The 3-song format on here, at least to me blows &quot;Close&quot;, off the cliff... get it?. Matter of fact this sounds much more experimental and &quot;progressive&quot; than that one. It starts off with &quot;The Gates Of Delirium&quot;, which is about war and stands at 22 minutes. This is truly an insane piece of music, but excellent as it features visionary sound effects like battle scenes from a movie. The same can be said about &quot;Sound Chaser&quot;, which is even more insane instrumentally. Tempo changes are flying all over the place. Very jazzy.  &quot;To Be Over&quot;, is truly a beautiful closing to an excellent album.<br />This is a great cd, with fantastic artwork also, give it a try if you like prog-rock/fantasy oriented music.<br />Thanks.
B0000508U6|5.0|This album is one of the greatest in a very long time, and I'm just waiting for &quot;Trouble&quot; to be released as a single, when it does there will be another mad rush to buy this album.  It's official now, &quot;Trouble&quot; is one of the best songs I have heard in the last 10 years.  Making a statement like that is very difficult, but I have already given that song a legendary status.  Absolutely mesmerizing piano, with beautifully sung lyrics, I get goosebumps when I listen to it.  As usual, the UK never dissapoints with guitar-oriented music...

6305078564|5.0|This is my favorite mini-series of all time.  The acting, cinemaphotography, script, and sound track were so incredible, that I felt like I was put under a magical spell.  The cast and crew should be so proud of themselves for creating such a Masterpiece.  You literally feel every emotion of love, longing, heartbreak, hope and dispair conveyed by the actors.  The on screen chemistry between Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle)and Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) is so intense and believable that you'd swear they loved one another in real life.  Somewhat a Cinderella story, this beautifully adpapted Austin novel will have you watching this bit of heaven, over and over again.
0618135871|4.0|Roth, of course, writes another good book. His look at eros is always in a league by itself, and in this book he extends its plane in all directions. To some it will seem &quot;revolutionary&quot; or &quot;selfish&quot; (beyond family's all-star crucible (!!))) - - but that is not its aim. It's closer to say that it tries to re-situate, or re-constellate, Eros in American life. It reads as an aesthetic/puer defense of imaginative life. Not (no)autobiography, but the life with aesthetics and eros at its (near) center. With its grandness and repugnance a city in the face - - this is a snapshot .   . ----   and a good one,
B00000099Y|5.0|I have been listening to this cd consistently for over 4 years now, awaiting their next album which I did in ostensible ingenuousness, I didn't think it would be this long, but it might have been a blessing in disguise, time to really breathe in Ænema. <br />I can't single out a favorite, I've tried to over time, and while the one that I listen to a lot hasn't changed(Eulogy), the way I appreciate all the songs on this album is tantamount. <br />May 15 will be a bittersweet day for me because I can't wait for Lateralus, but at the same time I don't see how it can possibly be as good as Ænema. One thing I'm sure of is that I will love finding out either way, just to hear more of the brilliance that is Maynard James Keenan will be more than enough for me.
B000056K04|4.0|I was kinda skeptical when I first heard Everyday...but then like the other albums, it grows on you.  For starters, &quot;I did it&quot; rocks you off your seat when you first hear it...for it is nothing like the other DMB songs.   But if you listen closely, there is a little of the &quot;old Dave&quot; lingering in every song. The title track has awesome harmony.  Granted the songs are a little ragged and edgy, this is definately a worthy buy so give it a chance and like mom used to say, &quot;You just may like it!&quot;

B00003CX95|5.0|As I write this, Gladiator is still enjoying its shower of praise. I recall with notable fondness a similar film to snag the Oscar for Best Picture, Braveheart. This is the true masterpiece of the genre (which might be medieval action/adventure or something). What makes Braveheart special? In many movies like this (for instance, Gladiator), the protagonist is only a hero because he suffers. In Braveheart, William Wallace is a hero because he fights against suffering. It is that simple fundament that sets Braveheart up to be a great film.<br />Of course, there is more that makes Braveheart great. Mel Gibson's performance as Wallace is riveting, emotionally charged, and...real. He portrays his character with incredible conviction that makes the movie so much more powerful. His requisite hero speeches are inspiring yet plausible, and positively electric with passion. Sorry, Russell Crowe, but Gibson is the true medieval hero of contemporary cinema. Gibson also proves to be a fine director, with a keen eye for detail and a shrewd understanding of the emotional element of the story.<br />The battle scenes are fittingly gory, and do an excellent job portraying the chaos and brutality of the epoch's battlefield. But the emphasis here is not on the battles between the Scots and the English; this is an enduring story of love, ideals, and heroism. I've never cried watching a movie, but the heart-wrenching (and concurrently uplifting) finale brought me very close. Indeed, this movie sweeps you along for its epic story, and practically makes you another Scottish warrior. Along with the actors, you feel the soaring elation of victory and the profound anguish of defeat. Amazing.<br />One of my favorite movies of all time. I've used the designation idly before, but here it's certainly true.
0446310786|4.0|I am currently reading To Kill a Mockingbird in my 8th grade English class. I must say, I have been pleasantly surprised. For a &quot;school book&quot; it is pretty darn good. Every adult I have talked to always says &quot;oh, you just HAVE to read TKAM&quot; yadayadayada. I think that this book is a true diamond in the rough. When you sift through all the controversial junk of today's world, this novel is refreshingly honest and well written. I would reccomend to anyone old enough to understand it.
B00004XONN|5.0|What can you say about Radiohead, they are creative geniouses.  Ditching guitars for the most part, KID A is almost a combination of Industrial and Ambient genres mixed with a little bit of old Radiohead.  Lyrically it is the same, beautiful.  To trully grasp the music in this disc you must just sit in a dark room and let your mind wander.  Songs like &quot;How to Disappear Completly&quot; are trully amazing.  GIVE THIS A CHANCE!
B00004Z459|5.0|This is probably my most played CD, it's great! but i don't think Linkin park is like Limp bizkit at all, (which is what some people say) i think they're better! the rap and the singing go totally well with each other, and the guitar riffs are amazing. <br />'Pushing me away' is the best vocal/guitar track on the CD, and 'one step closer' is a good one for rapping. 'cure for the itch' is really unique, (listen to it!) and it's really good because of that. <br />The more you play this album, the more you'll grow to like the songs. i haven't got tired of it, and i've had it for quite a long time now! If you buy this album, and you like this type of music, you'll love it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm a nu metal fan so when people hear me say that Radiohead is my favorite band they usually scratch their heads and say &quot;Aren't they realitvly slow&quot;?  The beauty of Radiohead is in the texture and approach they put into their music.  Songs like &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and &quot;Karma Police&quot; put you in a certine mind frame that makes life either very confusing or very enjoyable.  I can understand why some people will not like Radiohead due to the complexity they carry but you have to realise it will take more than one listen to truly grasp the music and when you do grasp it you are addicted.  <br />Lyrically Thom York is god.  Nobody can write a song like him.  The cynicism, the beauty, the TRUTH they carry carry into each word and phrase of his.  The album should be listened to from start to finish but the standout tracks are &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Exit Music&quot;, and &quot;Climbing Up The Walls&quot;.  Have fun and enjoy.
B000002MY3|5.0|if you like alanis morisette, (which you probably do if you're reading this review) you should really buy this album. the best of all her albums, 'jagged little pill' has some of her best songs, plus some unreleased ones that are just as good, if not better!  'ironic', 'you oughta know' and 'all i really want' are my favourites - fast and interesting, with some great lyrics. if you've heard ironic and like it, don't expect the rest of the album to be like that, because it varies. 'perfect' is very slow, as well as the hidden track, 'your house'.  So whatever type of song you like, i'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this album! alanis has a great voice, and the songs are really good. If you're trying to decide which of her albums to buy, it's definately this one! you won't be disappointed.

630157401X|5.0|This third film in the Indiana Jones trilogy (so far) has its heart in the right place, if at times its head is in the ether. Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones, the rogue archaeologist, playboy, and college professor that we have loved ever since his first appearance in the 1981 film, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark.&quot;<br />In &quot;The Last Crusade,&quot; Indiana's father has been kidnapped. It appears as if his father is obsessed with finding the religious artifact known as the &quot;Holy Grail,&quot; and that this obsession has partly alienated him from his son.<br />But we don't get too sentimental as the race to find the Grail begins. There is the usual bloodiness found in the previous films, and there is still enough excitement to tide us over until the fourth (hopefully) installment.<br />Sean Connery's performance is sheer, inspired lunacy. As the elder Dr. Jones, Connery is part eccentric, part failed father, and part goof. He plays the role with a kind of childish glee that is delightful to watch, and when he has scenes with Harrison Ford, the two are positively magical together.<br />My only complaint about the film is the way Spielberg decided to make a buffoon out of Indiana's colleague, Marcus Brody. Brody, in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark,&quot; was really just an older version of Indiana himself. He even intimated that he'd have gone after the Ark of the Covenant himself. But, in &quot;The Last Crusade,&quot; he was transformed into a geriatric idiot whose sheer ineptitude is only matched by his tendancy to hit the right bad guy at the right time by complete accident. If the filmmakers had not done this, I would have no complaints whatsoever.<br />I am still giving the film a 5-star rating because it is still a blast watching Indiana Jones tackle the bad guys.
B00005AFVR|5.0|If you wanted an album to remember why you love music this is it.  The gut feeling and the themes are still as strong today as they were when much of this music was originally written. It is not progressive, it is music that transends generations. The music performed in this recording is about people, both at their best and the weakest. The fact that this albums ends on a note of love and not a typical encore tells you all you need to know about Springsteen and his hope for the future.
B000000W5N|5.0|The aural upside, and lyrical downside, of EXILE ON MAIN STREET, STICKY FINGERS provided FM-radio with a handful of standards still played two decades later, and gave fans an insight into the heroin-induced hell Keith was in.<br />Though not as all-encompassing as EXILE, nor as friendly and cozy as LET IT BLEED or BEGGARS BANQUET, STICKY FINGERS is a classic nonetheless.  It was a blueprint for 70s hard rock, and gave the prettiest moment on any Stones LP, &quot;Moonlight Mile.&quot;  <br />Much of the credit has to go to Mick Taylor, the only man to ever quit the Rolling Stones and live (until Bill Wyman, anyway), and an underrated guitarist.  Keith was starting his decade-long slide, and Taylor more than picks up the pieces.
B000002UZ1|3.0|Ok I don't have a real problem with the Red 62-66 compilation. Its nice to have the Beatles best from their early albums on 2 CDs but there is no way you can take albums like Abbey Road, White Album, and Sgt Peppers and splice them together this way. Sure these are all great songs but there is no flow, and there are way to many missing songs. I mean really where's the Abbey Road medley (essential as they come), Birthday, Blackbird, and the list goes on... Enjoy collecting all the original albums, one at a time, then make your own mix if you must, but don't think 67-70 really tells the story, It don't !

0393307050|3.0|Fascinated by the hoopla surrounding Mr. O'Brian's wildly successful series and being a lover of historical fiction myself, I was drawn to this one. I first picked up and tried THE WINE DARK SEA, which is much later in the series. But I was a little put off by its very dry style and slow-moving pace. Still, I figured that with all the excitement about these books there must be more to them than I found in WINE. So I tried this one, MASTER AND COMMANDER, which is the first in the series and the beckoning portal for all Aubrey/Maturin fans.<br />Well, I found this one a bit better than WINE but, I must admit, I am still confused about all the fuss for these books. Here is a tale of two men who become friends aboard a small war ship in the shadow of the Napoleonic War. Neither individual is particularly vividly drawn though we do get a sense, albeit at some remove, of their very different personalities. We also see the very strained and formal aspects of interpersonal communications which O'Brian plainly saw as reflective of the tone of that day (though it is less clear to me that people were quite as stuffy and tightly drawn as he makes them out to be).<br />The events recounted are mainly episodic, too, amidst lots of \\"period\\" social gatherings and somewhat stuffy conversations. The characters are indeed interesting . . . to a point. But the tale, in the end, is just not structured tightly enough to suit me -- not a criticism in itself, to be sure, but a lack which, in my opinion, ought to be offset by something else: the strong interplay of personalities, powerfully wrought scenic backdrops, brilliantly soaring prose, a deep cultural tension, etc, etc. A good book can be good for many reasons and all or any of the foregoing can provide such reasons. Unfortunately, this book has none of these to offset its loosely structured narrative.<br />On the other hand, it does have a lot of nautical jargon, if you like that sort of thing, and a feel for the language of the period, though even this is rendered in a somewhat prosaic manner. And there are a few quite respectable battle scenes though these are not very clearly drawn either. In fact, there is very little sense here of the war at all. (Though this, alone, may be truest to the slower pacing of warfare on the high seas of that day.) In the end, this book, I suppose, gets its good name for the sense of authenticity it affords those who are fascinated by nineteenth century mores in war and peace and on the high seas.  ... I want to say at once that I have the utmost respect for the man, as an author who was plainly dedicated to his art. And I also imagine that there must be more to these books than I am seeing since so many readers can't be so utterly wrong. But, frankly, I have concluded that these books are just not for me and that, just possibly, and I say this with great hesitation as I am an author myself, the emperor, in this case, may be in need of a new tailor.<br />SWMiod, though even this is rendered in a somewhat prosaic manner.

0385334176|4.0|Although not Kurt Vonnegut's best novel, Deadeye Dick is an enlightening, fast-paced, and highly entertaining satrical look at the death of innocence and the randomness of life. Through the plot and the life of the protonagist, Rudy Waltz, we are shown how seemingly random and completely unforseeable events can completely change and/or wreck a person's life. Everything we do, however seemingly trivial, has a consequence. Vonnegut's writing style is as fluid and graceful as ever, with a prose, quick wit, and pace that will keep you reading. His ever-present humor and light touch with weighty subjects is apparent from the very first page. A good read that you will enjoy. If you are new to this author, I would recommend reading something like Cat's Cradle first, but this is a fine novel and recommended for all Vonnegut fans.
B00001ZWTT|4.0|Can anyone, tell me, what's wrong with it?!, i think that some aspects were exxagreated, but just in three times, the acting was good, the special FX, were great, it never bored me, the music it's also really very good, i think that many people, including critics,have lost their child inside for enjoying a film, like this one (sorry this is not quite for children).
B000056K04|5.0|I for one think that DMB made a great album.  All the songs are so good I can't name one as my favorite.  I would definetly reccomend this CD to anyone.
B0000026WD|5.0|When I first heard 'Dangerous' back in '91, I thought it was amazing.Ten years later after all the hype and noise that surrounded this album, it is still amazing and truly worth all the hysteria it started ten years ago.No wonder Rolling Stones called it a flawless album and gave it a rare 5 stars out of five!It deserved it.I recommend it to any music lover.It is the most diverse album I know.Get it and then you'll know why michael is called the king of pop.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This DVD is well worth the money!  I got mine four days before the May 1st release date and have been listening to it ever since.  The 5.1 Surround sound is magnificent! You will learn more about the making of this movie than ever with the documentaries and running commentary. The music is crisp and clear. Updated sound effects! Extra deleted scenes!! Though still missing some... Best way to show off that 5.1 home theater system!!
B00004XONN|4.0|Kid A, in my opinion, is very very impressive. With only some weak parts, and no weak song, it works very well. The whole listening experience is like going through hypothermia. Warm and comfortable, yet cold, and alien. Now, this is what may have changed people from Radiohead fans to Radiohead haters. The album, to me, was like a friend changing his image. You still like him, but a part of you misses the old one, and knows you'll never get him back(OK Computer, The Bends -to- Kid A and Amnesiac). Does this make sense? Okay, good...<br />Everything in its Right Place - what the hell? ah well, its a grower 7<br />Kid A - Weirdly, enough, the drums reminded me of Phil Collins and his bongos. I also thought it was an instrumental for a while, if you can believe that. 7<br />The National Anthem - Party! Wooo! This song kicks. Kinda winds down weird though, like an overheated machine. cool. 8<br />How to Disappear Completely - reminescant of the Beatles &quot;A day in the life&quot;, with its freaky string section. Different though, and the best on the album. 9.5<br />Treefingers - a break. Nothing more. cool to listen to when you go to sleep. 6<br />Optimistic - harsh song, with some cool kind of egytian thing going on. What the hells up with the last lyric? way out of place. 8<br />In Limbo - the weakest track on the album, still good though. Like the shimmering guitars, and vacuum ending. 5<br />Idioteque - the beats may put some off. I like it live better, or the BBC version, with more personality. Some of the best lyrics on the album, though. 8<br />Morning Bell - One of my favorites, here. Cool time, and cut and paste drums. The ending kinda reminded me of &quot;Echoes&quot;, by Pink Floyd, with its whale calls. Warning: dont listen to it on drugs. Trust me. 9<br />Motion Picture Soundtrack - beautiful lyrics. A funeral inside a computer, if you can get that. Oh, and the background noise is the sound of a film running. Love the last line, with a kinda pointless hidden track. 9<br />Lyrically and songwise, Kid A is kinda weak. I would've loved to see Radiohead try and combine Amnesiac and Kid A into a double album, however it worked out. But, just me talking. Someone help me out of the crushed tin box.
B000053V7Q|5.0|YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS RESTORATION. <br />For all of my 30 years of life, I have longed for the day when the manufacturers of Elvis' image (his estate and the various copyright holders of his product) would quit pandering to the least common denominator of his fans and give the world the essence(s) of what he was: the best communicator of song and the best performer/entertainer in the history of the world. As I got older I began to realize that, aside from the early Elvis, Col. Tom never allowed Elvis to associate himself with product that would showcase this fact. I always thought that the '68 comeback special was a fluke in the system because of what it captured of Elvis. <br />Until now.<br />The restorer of this film, either through intentions that he sought to get approval of or through the agenda that was handed to him, has successfully re-edited and reformatted this concert film to be just that: an incredible and masterful concert movie production. <br />From the very beginning it is clear what the agenda is going to be: to show the world just how powerful, charismatic, and complete of an entertainer Elvis was during this time. <br />Let me take you through a brief tour of the film:<br />The opening credits have been re-edited to be very cinematic. Even in watching these it's obvious that you're about to witness something that you have never seen before.<br />True to the original version we spend time with Elvis and band as they rehearse on the MGM lot. But it's different this time. This entire section has been re-edited to make you realize why they are rehearsing and the completeness of it. You don't feel like you're watching a goofball act stupid during rehearsals (like the original made you feel). Now, entire songs are carefully edited that show a band of great session players growing tight and close as a musical structure and to Elvis as his BAND. As a viewer, you don't feel like you're seeing a series of snapshots from the rehearsal (like the original showed you). Instead, when this portion is over, you feel like a much privileged fly-on-the-wall who has just witnessed a great behind-the-scenes synergy being created.<br />This portion is over and you get in and get out and you're on to Vegas. We're still shown images of Vegas (thank God without the redundant interviews of fans and hotel employees) but they are &quot;sped up&quot; to rush the experience and to show, it seems, the hurried pace and frenetic energy of &quot;needing&quot; to get there.  ALL WITH NEW FOOTAGE.<br />We spend a little time with Elvis and band rehearsing on the stage of the International and then we're on to his backstage jitters and even that's for a brief time, because the intent of this restoration is to show what this man was ON STAGE.<br />Aside from the band rehearsal that appears first in the movie, it's the on-stage performance that benefits the most from the restoration. New camera angles have been added (a dolly camera to introduce movement to the movie) and footage from a Phoenix performance (part of a mini-tour at the time) have been included. <br />And in doing so, a spectacle is delivered to you that shows why Elvis was so revered in the world of entertainment. Gone is the sentiment of just a man returning to a stage in Vegas. The producers of this restoration have crafted a movie that puts us in a seat in the venue to witness the man's stage prowess, power, and magnetism. For the first time, this movie doesn't merely document Elvis on stage, it showcases what he WAS on stage; what he BROUGHT to the stage. But more importantly, you feel like the cameras started up as he walked on stage and captured the man's every move and every emotion. That's how complete the re-edit is. It seems seamless.<br />During the restoration, the original 16 track masters to this movie were found and re-mastered to incredible brilliance. Things show up in the mix that were never heard before. During the rehearsals, Glen Hardin's piano is finally heard.Jerry Scheff's bass is remixed to Ronnie Tutt's drums to create the low-end rhythms that, to the viewer, were never before realized. <br />Additional bonus material added is a featurette on the making of the restoration (complete with interviews with the producer, and Elvis' original band members, and the always-showing-up-somewhere Joe Esposito). <br />Even if you aren't an Elvis fan, you have to witness this restoration on DVD. It's contribution to concert-movie-cinema is that significant.<br />In one of the few times in my life I feel encouraged and proud to say that I am an Elvis fan.

B000002NJS|5.0|RAY OF LIGHT is THE best album in my pop/rock CD collection.  Although it's been almost three years since its release date, I'm amazed by its timeless themes, mystical lyrics, haunting beats, and basically the title track.  RAY OF LIGHT is hands down the best dance song of all time.  Her voice never sounded better and now having both MUSIC and ROL to listen 2, i dont think i can ever again revert back to MUSIC.  ROL is just so beautiful from beginning to end (with the exception of Shanti/Ashtangi and Mer Girl).  FRozen is the second best track off the album and tracks such as THE POWER OF GOOD BYE, SKY FITS HEAVEN,LITTLE STAR are nearly as good but simply far exceeds nething on MUSIC, with the exception of MUSIC and DONT TELL ME.  Although as I've mentioned in my review months ago for MUSIC, they are opposites of one another.  NOw i know which one's the better side.  Had i owned ROL before MUSIc, i would have surely been dissapointed with MUSIC, but I have come to appreciate MUSIC as an album that keeps you on your toes...GO ELECTRONICA!!!
0312954468|5.0|River God is one of the most gripping books I have ever read. I loved the way that just when you thought the book must be coming to an end in the plot, new threads are introduced.  River God follows the life of an enunch in Ancient Eygpt, Taita and his connections to the highest ranking people in Upper Eygpt at that time.   I really don't think I could have learnt more about Egyption gods and lifestyle from a text book, every thing is so carefully researched but portrayed interestingly.  I would not recomend this book to a reader with a non-comittal attitude to reading as it is long and takes a while to get into it but after a chapter I found myself so engrossed that I could barely put te book down and was up many a nightuntil very late reading.
0792844890|5.0|I absolutly love this movie.  It is halarious.  Mel Brooks could very well be one of the funiest movie makers of all time.  Funny, he doesn't look Druish! (movie pun). It has parodies of some of the best sci-fi movies (an alien pops out of a guy's stomach (Alien) and starts to sing and dance).  They also in a way interact with the audience(they accidently turn off the movie with a remote and when the movie plot goes by kind of quickly, they ask the audience if they got all of it).  You should definnately buy this movie and watch it over and over again until you have cought every single joke.

This is the worst exorcist rip off I've seen.Think about this for a second,if your a dead priest trying to spread the true meaning of God,would you A:Take possession of an idiot hair stylist and write     important information on a wall,paint over it,slice your arms up and beat the snot out of the only guy who is trying to help you who is a priest ?

6305903182|3.0|What happened to the cool opening scene where a famous celebrity gets butchered? The clever film references in the first two movies? I might be wrong but i only counted one.They sliced away the cast members one by one through the first two but couldnt bring themselves two kill off not one of the three original players. The voice box thing is pretty stupid they kicked a good gimmick right in the jewels when they did that voice copy thing.And they cheat you when they show who the bad guy is because the set up is stupid.And the biggest slap to the face is they try to make it all okay by saying in the final part of a trilogy anything goes.
0380788624|4.0|Anyone who has ever worked for or with a start-up cannot help but appreciate this book.  The plot may border on absurd at times, but the subplots and actions of the protagonists in the modern thread of the story are like something right out of the valley.  As someone who works for a dot-com, I had instant sympathy for the characters.  <br />Other people who are not familiar with IPOs, start-ups and the nearly surreal world of tech, may not appreciate the modern story line except in how it ties the two threads together.<br />The parallel anachronistic thread having to do with code breaking and intelligence in WWII was a richly absurd plot as well with a definite Catch-22 flavor to it.  However, the characters were deeper and more interesting.  Stephenson tied the WWII thread to enough historical fact to make the story riveting and believable, and the links to the modern thread were a wonderful literary tool.<br />The Cryptonomicon faded about 80% of the way through and sputtered to the finish line, which is why I can only give it four stars.  I would enthusiastically read another Neal Stephenson book, but I thought the ending to this very enjoyable book left too many questions unanswered and abruptly closed what was an excellent story.<br />As a stylistic note, I believe that the nearly constant chatter about the sexual needs of the male characters was distracting and did not add to the story.  It was a useful mechanism within the story to explain some of the actions of the characters, but it was overdone.<br />If you read this book, please follow with Singh's &quot;The Code Book.&quot;  It gives the history of cryptography and will fill in the details of both the modern and WWII threads of the book.
B000002G7G|5.0|In this album, VU delivers a journey of love, lust, physical pleasures, pain, spiritual awakening, quiet desperation, catharsis, emancipation, confusion, reflection, humor...: of life itself.  And what a wonderful ride it is.

B000058T5E|5.0|This one caught me totally by surprise.  Where others do their forumulaic thing and rest on their laurels, Beck challenges himself and his listeners to break new ground.  And does so with high style and real innovation.  <br />I don't think I have listened to ANY album by ANYONE in the last two years where, as I listened, I just couldn't help but SMILE and MARVEL at the man's genius and sonic adventurousness.  It was exhilarating!!!!<br />This album throws the gaunlet down to the other giants of Beck's generation to do un-calcify themselves and make MUSIC, before its too late. <br />And where did Imogen Heap come from?  Her contribution is some of the most sensual and intoxicating vocals I've heard, ever.

It is a BRILLIANT work, and perhaps, the last book you or I will ever need if you take it to heart as did Nisardagatta take his Guru's simple instruction to heart.
B00005B6C9|4.0|You've never heard the Gibbs like this before, and yet you have.  They have taken bits and pieces from a number of their albums and put them on display in their latest effort.  There is a wide variety of music here, but it flows from one song to the next very well.  The title cut is a wonderfully arranged work taking full advantage of the vocal talents of both Robin and Barry.  Unlike some of their previous works, the production retooling doesn't seem overdone here.  Other favorites are Wedding Day (sure to be a wedding anthem), Man in the Middle (Mo's look at his relationship with his brothers)and Sacred Trust.  After forty years in the business, the Gibbs prove that they're still able to write songs that can connect with a number of generations.
B000002UAU|5.0|Dorothy Parker once said this about the Marx Brothers: &quot;They've never made a movie as wonderful as they are.&quot; So, I'll paraphrase her: &quot;The Beatles never made an album as wonderful as they were.&quot; Modern audiences see the Marx Brothers' &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and wonder why this movie was so much bigger than their other ones when it was released. By the same token, many wonder why &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was considered for so long, by so many people, the best Beatles album. &quot;The White Album&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; seem to speak to the average rock fan more than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; does. I think something has to be said for a band making a mark in its own day. While this album absolutely screams &quot;1967,&quot; it is one of the things we notice when looking for 1967. As great as the Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is, the listener doesn't automatically think, &quot;Aah, 1966,&quot; when hearing it. &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; symbolizes the year in which it was recorded. There is also something to be said for packaging. The famous cover photo works extremely well with the music. The listener hears the crowd as the orchestra warms up at the album's opening. This audience laughs at various points on the album. I imagine many listeners associate the crowd shown on the cover with the crowd heard on the album. Because the packaging is as closely tied to the music as it is, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; is an ultimate example of Pop-Art. Why shouldn't it be? Pop-Art was at a peak in 1967. For all the sound effects, it is the work of a band, and, true to the album's title, there is a theme: Loneliness. What could be more lonely than the death of the driver at the beginning of &quot;A Day in the Life?&quot; In &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning,&quot; the narrator is being driven mad by his crashingly boring routine. He feels at home not when he has tea and meets the wife but only briefly (&quot;watching the skirts you start to flirt now you feel cool.&quot;)The narrator's stuck with a wife and he's not connecting with her. &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four,&quot; with its Irving Berlin-style melancholy, does ask a serious question: Is somebody going to be around when I'm old?&quot; &quot;Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; is only partly about the circus. It's mostly about death. It's final notes echo the music played, most famously, by Lon Chaney's phantom. &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; has three lonely ccharacters (four if you count the faceless &quot;man from the motor trade&quot;) with a little horror thrown in. Who is this guy the daughter's fled with? Perhaps the Beatles' least ambiguous of sad lyrics is in this song: &quot;Picks up the letter that's lying there/standing alone at the top of the stair/She breaks down and cries to her husband/'Daddy, our baby's gone.'&quot; That's not saccharine. As hallucinogenic as &quot;Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds&quot; is, it's got a lonely wanderer as well. He's too out of it to respond to the dream he's experiencing. (&quot;Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly.&quot;) It's not as happy as we're supposed to think it is at first. Finally (to bring my mostly backwards tour to an end) the song &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; has what only seems to be a flippant question: &quot;What would you do if I sang out of key, would you stand up and walk out on me?&quot; I think that's essentially the reason most people walk out on other people. It occurs to me that a tone of loneliness runs through most of the Beatles music. On &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; they took that loneliness and dressed it in party-colored confetti. Brush a little of it away and you'll see the lonely hearts.
B000031XCR|5.0|Celine Dion is an angel. Her voice takes you to the edge of your senses and definitely doesn't let you go back until several minutes after the album stops playing. She has a way of making you feel the emotions from the songs. She does not just sing well; she puts her soul into every note and syllable. The best songs on this album must be &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot;, &quot;The One To Love You More&quot;, &quot;The First Time&quot;, &quot;Then You Look At Me&quot;, &quot;I Want You To Need Me&quot;, and &quot;Live&quot;. But her masterpeice has to be &quot;Then You Look At Me&quot;, it is the most beautiful definition of love ever written, and Celine Dion is truly the only one with a voice worthy of singing it.
0800139151|3.0|This isn't your average Western movie.  One look at who directed it will tell you that much.  Horror/fantasy specialist Sam Raimi takes his first jaunt into the Old West (at least, since 'Brisco County Jr.') and it's actually pretty good.  The plot's pretty basic; a female gunfighter (perish the thought!) comes to a small town to get herself a little revenge from the town's corrupt mayor for &quot;ruining her life&quot; back in the day.  She does this by entering the local &quot;gunfighters' tournament&quot;.  The story basically goes from there and leads to an explosive finish, pitting &quot;The Lady&quot; against the mayor.  <br />One would think that Raimi would enter a fantasy element of some kind into a movie like this, but amazingly, there's none.  Just a simple Western action flick with a couple of plot twists here and there to keep you watching.  And the action's pretty cool, too; Raimi adds some interesting elements to the gunfights themselves, without needing any real &quot;special effects&quot;.  The best part about this film, though, is the cast.  They bring the main and supporting characters to life wonderfully.  Sharon Stone makes a great leading &quot;tough gal&quot;, and Gene Hackman, always a terrific villain, plays out one of the most despicable, evil people ever created as the town's mayor.  (I spent the entire movie hating him!)  Leo DiCaprio's a winner as the mayor's &quot;son&quot; as well.  Russell Crowe also turns in a breakthrough performance as a reformed killer-turned-preacher.  The rest of the cast is aces and look as well as play their parts to a T.  There are a couple of &quot;down notes&quot;, though; first of which being the dialogue.  Some of it's pretty cheesy and doesn't fit the image of the film very well.  (I didn't know they said things like &quot;why don't you come get some&quot; in the Old West.)  But hey, that's Sam Raimi's style; you either like it or you don't.  The story, while a little different, is very predictable; pretty much from the beginning you know how it's going to end.  The movie's a fun ride nonetheless, though, and it's got lots of action, and gets the blood flowing.  Fans of Westerns should dig it.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Okay... here's my take on the whole Star Wars saga gig.  I dug Episode 1.  Yes, it has its problems (which I will address, I promise) but visually, it is filled with color, vibrance, excitement, and a hint of possibility.  And that's the keyword to all the Star Wars films: possibility.  Throughout the saga, we see the Dark Side as materialistic and bent upon power, destruction, and obsession.  The Sith always speak of &quot;destiny,&quot; almost as a nihilistic ultimatum that everyone is forced to endure; according to them, there is no way out of what one can foresee.  However, the Light Side continually speaks of being &quot;guided&quot; by the Force, and a possibility for change from a foreseen destiny still withstands.  Perhaps this is why Qui-Gon Jinn's body does not disappear when he passes on as Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi's did...  He lost that organic belief in the spirit and emotion, resigning his trust in Anakin and those around him to the events he has foreseen.  True, these events were of good nature: he freed Anakin from slavery and helped his doomed crewmates aboard the Queen's ship.  Yet, he lost that belief in change.  Also, this same obsession and trust in a pre-determined fate may also be why the Emporer rebuilt the Death Star in Return of the Jedi... His sight in the future was dominated by an obsession with realizing the creation of this ultimate weapon of power and destruction.  Luke's destruction of the first Death Star simply allowed the Emporer, in his mind, to create a more powerful and defensive weapon to better accomodate his sight of &quot;destiny.&quot;  My point is, the Light Side prevails and human vitality and possibility reign and bring a balance, an awakening, within the characters' lives.  Maybe i'm over-analyzing all this.  Still, here's my point: I think George Lucas is caught up in the special effects of his films, but I also think he's gotten lost in trying to thematically place all of his characters.  Forgive me, but I actually did like Jar-Jar Binks.  I think his purpose within the series was to show an innocent rise in power throuh the luck of chance.  But, other than that thematical reason, he really serves no purpose as a character.  I liked him (strange as that may sound), but he was kinda pointless other than for the kids and comic relief.  Deep down, beneath a very rusty surface, the Star Wars saga has a very human heart.  Nevertheless, George Lucas should not stumble upon these themes by chance, as Jar-Jar has by his own fate.  Just because we now have the ability to tell a story and let go of all boundaries doesn't mean that we HAVE a great story to tell.  Please, Mr. Lucas, retain the integrity of your films as an art and as entertainment.  You succeeded with flying colors in American Graffitti and A New Hope... even moreso with The Empire Strikes Back.  We understand your purpose in repeating events (the bigger fish eating the smaller one... twice.  The Death Star... twice.)  but please remember to expose that human nature to the Star Wars films creatively, extending beyond the boundaries of repetition in storytelling.  And above all, don't get mixed up with  entertainment and the themes you aim to express.   It seems more and more like these two things are becoming oil and water, shaken not stirred.  When, in fact, they should be more like that blue goop that Luke got served from Aunt Beru.  Episode 1 is fun, guys.  It succeeds in entertaining, but left too much repetition &amp; seemingly-dropped plot elements.... and too much bland acting. (as a result of no character development... not lack of talent and skill on the actors' part) Please, I'm on my knees, leave your characters with that sense of possibility and change; this is the one thing that still can be preserved for the future of the Star Wars universe.  Maybe I've overdone all this and gone overboard and melodramatic with my analyzation.  *shrug*....  And majorly fun, and at times, touching.  Rock the house, Mr. Lucas, and keep it fun for us all, never forgetting to implement your themes beyond just plain ol' symbols and into the acting, script, and cinematography...  Make art.
0790729725|5.0|Goodfellas, for me, is the climax for movies. This is, hands down, the greatest movie i have ever seen. The acting is untouchable, the directing, the cinematography and of course, the story. If you have not seen this movie, you have not lived. The soundtrack is even perfect. Another gem that proves De Niro is God.<br /> It is 2 sided and there is no real extras. The transfer looks good but don't expect no deleted scenes or anythign like that. But it's Goodfellas, there is no good excuse. Buy it.
0375707972|2.0|As a fan of the Oprah Book Club selections, I was a bit disappointed by this particular book.  The Reader is quite somber and dark.  Given the topic (holocaust) this is entirely understandable.  This aside, I found the novel to be a bit of a &quot;downer&quot; and not uplifting or motivating in any way.  Perhaps that is not the intent?  However, if you are craving a read that will fill your spirit with the &quot;warm fuzzies,&quot; The Reader is not it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Not enough can be written about the relevatory beauty of &quot;OK Computer&quot;'s electronic space rock majesty.  My first listen was off of my sister's poorly-made cassette copy, and I have to say that it made absolutely no sense.  Thom's vocals seemed totally unintelligible and the music seemed too hectic to really be enjoyed.  Upon studying the CD version, however (over and over and over again), I realized that OK CPU was a masterpiece of new ideas and complex moods.  Taken as a whole (music, lyrics and album art) the album truly is an unmatched experience, one so cerebral and ultimately rewarding that I find something new in it with every listen.  Even as &quot;background music&quot; it succeeds, painting the world around you with infinitely dense soundscapes and gorgeous emotions.  Recommended for fans of the Beatles and Pink Floyd, or any other music that satisfies your heart and your mind at the same time.
B00003CXS4|5.0|First of all this movie just plain rocks.  I was laughing from start to finish.  Everything from the weapons used to the pitbull eating a squeak toy is funny. If you havent seen this movie you should. And i know for a fact that my DVD collection wont be without it.
B000001DTM|5.0|Common opinion holds that &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is U2's best album. As is so often true, common opinion is dead wrong. This is the band's masterpiece, the album which elevates them to Beatle-like greatness. Just when everyone thought they had U2 figured out, the band sprung this album on them. It proves their versatility and their adaptability to new sounds; it also showcases the band's rougher edges, delving into recesses of the mind and spirit not reached on any previous recording. There are songs here that will knock your socks off with the ferocity of their sound; there are songs that will make you want to cry with the simple power of their heartfelt and unfailingly truthful lyrics. There are a handful of albums that no person who considers him or herself to be a music fan should be without, and this is one of them. If you don't own it, please, cure this major deficiency in your collection. If you haven't heard it, listen to it now- not tomorrow, not when you get a chance, but now.
B00004LN16|5.0|How would Brian Johnson's voice sound, 20 years after Back In Black?  What would AC/DC do differently this time?  Would they have a big hit on this album?  These are questions that I and a lot of others had before buying this CD, but I forgot them soon after because this CD rules!  Johnson's voice is still high and explosive, and AC/DC blended their blues roots with hard rock.  Can't Hold Me Back is an underrated hit.  The title track is pure AC/DC power.  All AC/DC fans must get this CD or they will have an incomplete collection.
6304578458|5.0|I can't say enough about this film. Good story, gread acting. It is witty, clever, fast paced, plenty of excellent lines at just the right time. Also has an excellent soundtrack.  I would probably call it a dark comedy just for the &quot;professional killer&quot; aspect, but it is definitely a movie to see.
B0000025YM|2.0|my brother recently moved into my house, and with him came his record collection. contained in said collection was several of my  old metal records which i felt like i had outgrown in my pursuit of folk, psychedelia, power pop, &amp; garage. in the center of his mass of discs was this one. i remember going to sound warehouse and buying it the day it was released and it sat on my turntable for months afterwards. so the other day i put it on again to relive that metal rush i had distanced myself from. oh what a difference 15 years makes! this isnt any good! it used to be my favorite priest record, but even after going so long without hearing sad wings, unleashed in the east &amp; british steel, i know those are much better. sure this surpasses turbo, but hell CINDERELLA surpasses turbo. outside of freewheel burning &amp; love bites, there is little memorable on this, although i must admit to getting a kick out of hearing eat me alive again, knowing rob halford's, um, preferences. take it all, indeed. yes, i did not feel like the spotty 14 year old metal head relishing the power and force of these hellions, i felt like a damn 30 year old wishing i had had better taste back then. for gods sake, in 1984, let it be, zen arcade, and double nickels on the dime were released and i was listening to THIS??? squaresville, baby. i was nowhere, and so will you unless you buy something else.
B00003CX5A|5.0|i was really surprised at how great this movie was. i thought that it would be your average horror movie, but it was anything but! not to mention the fact that it was nominated for several academy awards, and even won one!~ i recomend this movie to anyone who is a tim burton, johnny depp, christina ricci fan, or just a person in the mood for a movie that's scary, dramatic, funny, and romatic all at the same time. buy it!
B00003CXN4|2.0|1. Take off two stars for no commentary 2. Take off another star for not including the original television mini-series.  The DVD format just begs for these kinds of extra goodies. Why are they not included?<br />Fans of this great movie deserve more than this. It's too bad. I guess we'll just have to wait for the &quot;special limited collectors' edition&quot;.
B00005ARDC|4.0|Black Rebel Motorcycle Club being touted as &quot;britpop wannabies&quot;? Well, yes, America could use a band that rises above the cookie-cutter Blink 182/Green Day whiny, nasal vocal monotony, but now that &quot;britpop&quot; encompasses more folk and acoustically-aligned artists like Badly Drawn Boy, Tram or Coldplay, I don't see the necessity of accusing an American band of sounding too British ... jeezus that gets old. <br />BRMC is an impressive debut from this L.A.-based band, combining some of the best elements of druggy, droney 60's psychedelia and garage R&amp;B rock; and on occasion, lead guitarist/vocalist Peter Hayes sounds uncannily like Roger (Jim) McGuinn of The Byrds (see &quot;Too Real&quot; or &quot;Salvation&quot;). BRMC sounds like a hybrid of the Jesus and Mary Chain and Spiritualized (there we go with comparisons again!), but they've also managed to carve out their own style such that you won't mistake them for either of the aforementioned. Standout songs are &quot;Love Burns&quot;, &quot;Whatever Happened to My Rock 'n' Roll (punk song)&quot;, &quot;Awake&quot;, &quot;Rifles&quot; and &quot;Spread Your Love&quot;. One of the most refreshing, promising American debuts in years.
B000002UA9|5.0|With the advent of the Beatles, a new era in pop music was inaugurated. The Fab Four brought something fresh and new to the popular music scene, and with it they ushered in the British pop stars invasion of the nineteen sixties. With this first album, The Beatles rocked the music establishment with a saucy, cheeky exuberance and highly stylized vocals. These four boys from Liverpool, England took the then somewhat moribund record industry by surprise...and what a surprise it was!<br /><br />With eight of the fourteen tracks written and composed by what would become one of the most prolific songwriting duos of the twentieth century, McCartney/Lennon, the Fab Four burst onto the music scene of the the early nineteen sixties, and pop music was never the same again. These early, simple songs are firmly imbedded in the consciousness of most baby boomers. From the syncopated rythyms of &#34;Love Me Do&#34; to the youthful innocence of &#34;Please Please Me&#34;, which are two of the biggest singles from this CD, add the enthusiastic strains of &#34;I Saw Her Standing There&#34;, toss in a romantic ballad, &#34;P.S. I Love You&#34;, and one has the makings of a hit. There is not one bad track on this CD.<br /><br />Those who did not grow up while Beatlemania was at its peak would do well to begin their musical exploration of The Beatles with this CD. It will ground them in what the magic of The Beatles was all about. It was here that it all began.
B000050HTO|3.0|Putting out a disk called the Essential Bob Dylan and leaving out Visions of Johanna and Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall is like putting out The Essential Zager and Evans and leaving out In the year 2525.
B000002UAC|5.0|This second album by The Beatles is just as good as the first. It features fourteen tracks, with seven of them written by the incomparable McCartney/Lennon duo, who went on to become one of the most prolific songwriting teams of the twentieth century. George Harrison, in a rare excursion for him at the time, wrote one of the tracks, the haunting &#34;Don't Bother Me&#34;.<br /><br />A magical meld of pop and rock, on this CD one can distinctly see that John Lennon is the edgier, grittier one of the McCartney/Lennon duo in terms of vocals, a veritable rocker, while Paul McCartney is softer, and more pop oriented. This CD is a wonderful review of some great, original early Beatles' music, &#34;It Won't Be Long&#34;, &#34;All My Loving&#34;, and &#34;Hold Me Tight&#34;, among others, as well as some traditional rock and pop favorites, &#34;Roll Over Beethoven&#34;, &#34;Money&#34;. and &#34;Please Mr. Postman&#34;. It is certainly a CD well worth listening to, filled as it is with their signature sound.
0446310786|4.0|&quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; is about growing up in a lazy town in South. The story focuses upon two young children and last throughout a few year period. The main character is a stubborn little tom girl named Scout who is very adventurous and completely innocent at heart. Her father is a lawyer who is a great person morally and will always stand up for what's right. One day, a case comes into town about a black raping a white girl, and the father, Atticus, is assigned to the trial. The whole town is shaken up by this case since the old talk of the town was a confined neighbor by the name of Boo. The racism issue comes into play during the trial. The part that shows how wrong the racism is, is that a little girl, free of any past experiences or any hatred, is amongh the few that realize the extreme wrongness that is taking place. This book can be taken on at the least two levels. The higher level is much more extreme in the overall moral being displayed. This is one of my favorite books because of the amazing way that such a deep feeling and concept of &quot;wrongness&quot; is brought to a reader through words. Without a doubt, this is recomended to anyone who can read.
B000002UAI|4.0|Coming on the heels of the highly touted, critically successful  album, &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, this one pales somewhat in comparison. It is still certainly worthy of note, however, as are all albums put out by The Beatles, and it is a very good album by any measure.<br />Here, only eight of the fourteen tracks were penned by the McCartney/Lennon songwriting duo, but they constitute an interesting shift in style, showing more depth, maturity, and complexity.  From the somewhat dark, pensive &quot; I'm a Loser&quot; to the melodic lament of &quot;Baby's in Black&quot;, followed by the pop ballad, &quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot;, it is clear that The Beatles are forging in a somewhat new direction.<br />The other six tracks on this CD are pop and rock standards upon which The Beatles have placed their signature imprimatur. Juxtaposed with the McCartney/Lennon songs, it makes for an interesting, though quirky, listening experience. As with all Beatles CDs, no music collection should be without it.
0425156842|2.0|This might be good for someone who has had no exposure at all to philosophy, in which case the ideas would seem new and exciting. Otherwise, Alberto's lectures are too basic. <br />I'm about two/thirds through it, and I'm getting fed up with Sophie's constant sarcastic interjections during her lessons. Plus, Sophie not only immediately grasps completely new concepts, but she astutely compares one philosopher's reasoning to another's, while accurately honing in on weaknesses in their arguments -- I can't imagine a 15-year old like this.<br />I'll probably just skim the rest of it -- I want to find out how everything goes with my favorite character, Hermes.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is a great CD. It is the first Beatles' album released in which all the songs were composed by the McCartney/Lennon duo. From rock to pop to ballads, they did it all. Coupled with their stylized vocals and the band's signature sound, it is quintessential Beatles' music. Without a doubt, this was a landmark album, as The Beatles were at the high point of their popularity and Beatlemania was rampant. All you baby boomers out there know what I am talking about.<br /><br />This CD showcases The Beatles' versatility as they rock through \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and then segue into a great pop tune, \\"I Should Have Known Better\\". This is followed by the romantic \\"If I Fell\\", and for those who love a beautiful ballad, there is the haunting and melodic \\"And I Love Her\\", sung only as Paul can. Likewise, those who love a gritty, pulse pounding rock beat will be thrilled by John's raspy vocals on \\"You Can't Do That\\". These songs are just the tip of the iceberg, however, as there is not one bad track on this CD.<br /><br />It was with this CD that The Beatles took a pivotal role in the shaping of pop music in the twentieth century. No music collection should be without it.
0446677450|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It helped me to look at the way I handle money and why. I was already started in the real estate business, but this book helped push me into further action. I have also played the game &quot;Cashflow&quot;, which was developed by the author. It is excellent as well.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|London Calling is one of the very best punk rock releases of all time. Simple as that. Originally released on vinyl as a double album, it is now available on one, remastered CD. Nineteen tracks and over an hour of some of the finest rock from the late seventies.<br />While it is usually categorised as a punk album, London Calling contains a very large range of musical styles. What is really impressive about this melange is that the music still feels as though it belongs together. Much credit for this diversity with coherence should go to the producer Guy Stevens. He had produced Mott the Hoople earlier in the seventies and, on a couple of the tracks, you could almost imagine that you were listening to Ian Hunter and co.<br />The title song, now enjoying a new lease of life as a result of exposure in the movie Billy Elliot, is straight down the line punk and it is my favourite track here. It is followed by a slew of really great songs ranging in style from the musical whimsy of &quot;Jimmy Jazz&quot; to the Reggae of &quot;Rudy Can't Fail.&quot;<br />These tracks, which made up the first half of the original double album release are splendid indeed. Other highlights from the first half include &quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot; and &quot;Spanish Bombs&quot;.<br />While nothing on the second half is poor, there are far fewer real gems there. That does invite criticism that the band should have been more selective in the material that was released but I'm more than happy to have all of these songs.<br />If you are seeking an introduction to the band, or even to the punk genre, this album will do you nicely.
0375500901|5.0|In Daniel Silva's latest thriller, The Kill Artist, he not only continues the suspense created in The Mark Of The Assasin, he exceeds it. This book can't miss being a sure-fire smash with all readers who like international espionage thrillers; and it  will keep you glued to the edge of your seat. Silva's writing style is so &quot;grabbing&quot; it will make you feel that you're personally there in the middle of the action. The action is non-stop, the plot is excitng and includes several surprises, and the characters are so fully developed, you'll think you really know them. If you're looking for a book in which you can fully &quot;get lost&quot;, get yourself a copy of The Kill Artist as soon as you can.
6305350205|2.0|From just about anyone's standpoint, this is not a good film.  But the problem isn't the directing.  William Shatner clearly knows how to handle a camera and draws fine performances from the cast (especially DeForest Kelley).<br />The problem with Star Trek V centers on the script.  There is an old Broadway saying, &quot;If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.&quot;  The failure of this movie proves the validity of that truism.  Since Shatner is listed as one of the persons behind the story here, he must bear his fair share of the responsibility for the problems with this story.  Creating a script about the search for a tangible God, even if it winds up  being a false God, sets the viewer up for disappointment.  No matter how spectacularly the Almighty is presented on film, it can't live up to the real thing.  In this film, He comes across as a latter day Wizard of Oz.  Compounded with that are the problems with continuity within the Trek &quot;universe,&quot; and overall tone: introducing Sybok as Spock's half-brother, and the use of the cast for slapstick humor, do not help an already implausible story.  Small wonder Gene Roddenberry did not consider this film to be canonical Trek.<br />The special effects, which are crude and amateurish, do not help matters.  However, the special effects during the original series were often sub-par, yet the old shows continue to satisfy even in today's CGI era.  (Anyone with any doubts about that should simply check how well the Original Series DVDs have been selling on Amazon.) The anemic visuals merely add to the problems here because they are coupled to a weak script.<br />About the most charitable thing one can say about this film is that it features a wonderful score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith. But that is not enough to save this uninspiring quest.<br />No complaints about the sound &amp; picture, although more extras would have been welcome.
014028009X|1.0|I am reading this last thing at night so as to go to sleep more quickly.  Trust me, it's really effective.<br />This book reads like the typical article in a women's magazine: we've already heard it all before.  I expect the reason for the hype is that unfortunately lots of girls out there have concerns just as superficial as Bridget Jones's.<br />The only reason I haven't yet given up on it is because my office mate so enthusiastically asked me to read it, and I don't want to offend her.

B00005B6C9|4.0|Its Hard to believe that the Bee Gees have had hits in the 60's 70's 80's 90's and know in the year 2000.  This Is Where I Came In is full of top class songs like Sacred Trust, Man In The Middle, Embrace and This Is Where I Came In.  This album shows why the Bee Gees have amassed a huge army of fans.
B000000OU0|5.0|It is nearly impossible to put into words just how great this album is, but i'm going to try.  I bought this CD soon after it was released in late '94, and let me tell you it &quot;Just doesn't get any better than this&quot;!  This album is vintage Eagles, Don Henley and Glenn Frey have never been better.  It has 4 new tracks recorded in the studio, and 11 of their greatest hits recorded live.  It was their first concert together in almost 14 years, but it sounds like they only took a weekend vacation.  The chemistry that this band has is truly amazing.  Eagles fan or no,  If you don't own this album, you MUST add this to your collection PRONTO!  You won't be disappointed!
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is one of the best albums that i have heard this year.  The main reason that i bought the album is that i liked the track Crawling.  There are plenty of tracks on this album that meet the standard of Crawling like One Step Closer, Papercut, Runaway and Forgotten.  Thsi is a must have album for any lover of great music
B000001EHS|5.0|Put the CD in, and crank it up!  This is the best of the best by one of the greatest bands of all time.  I bought this CD when it was released in '95, and I can honestly say that this is pure, polished rock-n-roll.  From &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; to &quot;Bringing On The Heartbreak&quot;, this album has it all, burners, ballads, soaring guitars and fantastic vocals by lead singer Joe Elliot.  I can't say enough to do this album justice, so if you don't own it, I suggest that you pick it up, put it in, and let the music do the talking!!
6304383827|3.0|I have noticed that particularly well-written stories attract more intelligent reviews than most of the best-selling trash. Not near as many reviews, of course, but much more literate. The same goes for videos. Quite a number of the reviews praising &quot;Emma&quot; are among the best I've seen on the Amazon site. Conversely, I found three outstanding negative reviews in which the reviewers stated their dislikes so compellingly that I've had to reconsider my perception of this movie.<br />For insight into what I mean, read the reviews below by dinkybob2, Anne Woodley, and Ken Groom. Woodley says, &quot;I am a Janeite and I don't like to see people fiddling around with the divine Austen.&quot; Serious writers have been studying Jane Austen's works for 200 years. Patrick O'Brian said he unabashedly adopted elements of her style. (Which is, of course, why writers study other writers.) Woodley speaks for me, too, when she says, &quot;The fact that Austen's perfect words have been read with great enjoyment for hundreds of years leaves me wondering why script writers are so determined to improve them...&quot;  It takes a mighty big ego for a screenwriter to presume to improve Jane Austen's use of dialog.<br />Dinkybob2 disliked the &quot;laughability of the historical accuracy of this version of 'Emma'&quot;, and she explains why. Ken Groom expressed the same objection. Dinkybob2 objected to a passionate and graphic kiss between Emma and Mr. Knightly, and explains, &quot;The Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle 'Pride and Prejudice' shows what I think is a lovely example of how people in love would've behaved together [in that period].&quot; Many persons familiar with eighteenth-century social customs, as they were accurately described by Jane Austen, would agree. <br />Austen fans identify the characters she created down to the last detail, and their precisely-described conduct as well. Indeed, has any author ever excelled Jane Austen in characterization and scene descriptions? Both dinkybob2 and Anne Woodley suggest other screen adaptations of Jane Austen's books which they feel are superior to Emma, and they provide lucid reasons for their opinions.<br />This forum for customer comments presented by the Amazon site is one of its most valuable features. Contrasting viewpoints, when well expressed, are highly influential in my buying decisions.<br />Maybe I was misled into believing I enjoyed this film because the version produced by BBC was so gosh-awful. (I'm pleased that it isn't offered on the Amazon.com site.) Austen said Emma was &quot;nearly&quot; twenty-one. The actress who played Emma for BBC was at least 35 when the film was made, or looked it. Jane Austen would not have considered her &quot;handsome,&quot; as she described the real Emma. BBC's Mr. Knightly was combative with Emma, not sensibly argumentative and genteel during their debates.<br />Among the grievous aspects of the BBC movie was that the screenwriter had the audacity to completely rewrite Austen's superb dialog between Emma and Mr. Knightly.<br />Most viewers who posted comments on this &quot;Emma&quot; liked the movie. Maybe you will too. But, then again, some four out of five readers out of over 1000 who commented on &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; were very positive in their reviews while I thought it was a piece of trash. (It was awarded the National Book Award, too.) So much for my likes and dislikes.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a richly packed novel adventure.  Lois Lowry skillfully fascinates her readers with a story that deals with real concepts such as, the meaning of life.  This novel was so enjoyable because it allowed me to open myself up to new ideas and use my imagination to enter the world of Jonas.  By the end of the first chapter I was so interested in the book I just couldn't put it down.  I specifically enjoyed the way the author transformed the reader into the world of the main character, Jonas.  The readers, like Jonas are asked to question their beliefs, dreams and uncertainties.  This novel is so abundantly filled with adventure and imagination that I highly recommend Lois Lowry's, The Giver.  It is an enjoyable experience that all should partake in, whether young in age or young in heart.
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung baby is BY FAR the BEST U2 album, as well as one of (if not the BEST) albums of the 90's, and of all time! Every album U2 has made in their career was absolutely amazing, and when finished listening, you feel like you have truly been giving something special, especially on achtung baby... it was a complete turning turning point in the bands career, and the title completely applies to the album! &quot;ACHTUNG&quot; meaning FOOLED YOU in german is perfect for the album because the fans were fooled in many ways, 1. the albums cover was the 1st COLOR cover the band ever had. 2.The music in general 3. The pictures of the band in the booklet.... the edges pants with the studs, the U2 rings *bling bling* etc.... The lyrics on this album are AMAZING ... just listen to THE FLY.. AMAZING LYRICS! .... or LOVE IS BLINDNESS... WOW! EVEN BETTER THAN THE REAL THING! MYSTERIOUS WAYS was a sound that brought the band into an incredible and modern new sound ,and everyone that heard it was shocked to see that it was a U2 song.....and dont forget the awesome sound of zoo station! bonos vocals and lyrics were incredible on this album as well as the edges guitar playing which is like NO OTHER! he uses his guitar to make sounds that have totally never been heard before and he does a great job..... and you cannot forget larry mullen, the most wonderful drummer drummer in the world, and adam clayton who plays like no other :) ...... and then there is the best song on the album, my favourite and many other fans favourite....

B000051VWW|4.0|I've read some of the reviews of this album, and it is hard for me to believe there is anyone out there who isn't touched by this piece of work by an uncomprimsing, pure artist like Sade. There is so much happening within the smooth cuts of this album that you must turn the lights off and demand quiet while you are listening. Listening to this cd is truly soul-spirit time. Check out Lover's Rock (the cut), Immigrant, Every Word and Somebody Already Broke My Heart, and you will see a Sade whose sound has, indeed, sonically matured. One reviewer was disappointed because the rhythm of her earlier albums seems to be missing. Well, if this is true, maybe it's because she is clearly exploring other types of rhythms (ex. Immigrant, Somebody Already...). Other than a touch of reggae, it is hard to classify the sounds on this cd, and maybe that is the point in the first place. Sade has never been easily classified. Just take a listen, and grow to where the music takes you. A true Sade fan is open to change. Like Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef, Sade will take you to a different place than the pop charts are used to from album to album. Just take a listen, turn the lights out, don't even invite your girl or your man over; just listen to it alone by yourself, let it sink in over a few listens, and you will truly say, and not be &quot;kidding yourself,&quot; as one reviewer said, that this is truly her best work ever.
B00003CXQY|5.0|After returning home from being summoned to the Emperor's palace, where he learned that his hilltop home will soon be demolished to make way for the Royal Vacation House, gentle, oversized Incan villager Pacha makes a strange discovery in his cart: A talking llama! But this is not just any talking llama, it's Emperor Kuzco himself, a spoiled, arrogant, sarcastic young man who is concerned with no one's welfare but his own. The victim of a potion given to him by his conniving, recently fired, and now disgruntled assistant, Yzma, with the help of her slow-witted, pretty-boy henchman, Kronk, Kuzco demands that Pacha help him get back to his palace and restore himself to normal in Yzma's secret lab. But, Pacha wants Kuzco to build his summer home somewhere else. The two can't agree, and Kuzco takes off through the dangerous jungle on his own. Of course, goodhearted Pacha can't allow Kuzco to get eaten by jaguars or fall off a cliff, so he soon follows, and the pair begin a Disney road-trip like no other! Facing one pitfall after another and the need to repeatedly elude the pursuing Yzma and Kronk, Pacha and Kuzco will have to work together to survive and accomplish their goal. But, in order to do that, Kuzco will have to develop a \\"new groove\\" for his life.<br /><br />Surely one of Disney's most unusual animated features, \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is a straight-up comedy, though not without its tender side. There are no limits set on the jokes in this laugh-a-minute picture, where ancient Incans perform Riverdance and run diners in the middle of the jungle. The cast is stellar, with the likes of Eartha Kitt as the villainous Yzma, Patrick Warburton as the hilarious Kronk, John Goodman as kindly Pacha, Wendie Malick as his wife, Chicha, and Tom Jones as the Theme Song Guy. But the star of this flick is easily David Spade in the role of Emperor Kuzco, the most sardonic and arrogant Disney character ever invented! The legendary Sting provides the music in this beautifully animated and definitely under-appreciated film, including the wonderful Oscar and Grammy nominated song, \\"My Funny Friend and Me.\\" Opening with little hype and weak returns, this marvelous comedy represents a complete and experimental change in style for the Disney Studios after its musical extravaganzas were starting to wane at the box office. Luckily, the public eventually caught on to what a great film this is when it hit home video, and it now has a direct to video sequel (Kronk's New Groove) and a highly entertaining animated series. The original film is a must own, of course, but if you are a true fan, you must seek out the 2-disc \\"Ultimate Groove Edition\\" that is now out of print. Don't be fooled by the slipcover flash of the \\"New Groove Edition,\\" which does little to improve on the original single-disc release. The 2-disc set is the way to go. The \\"Ultimate Groove Edition\\" includes a terrifically informative producer/director commentary on Disc One that  includes other crew members as well, plus a trivia game, DVD-Rom features, and an awful Rascal Flatts video aimed at kid viewers who want to learn a bad dance. Disc Two is where the meat is (besides the great commentary, of course), which makes this 2-disc set seem almost like a Disney Platinum Edition release! Producer Randy Fullmer and director Mark Dindal are our hosts on disc 2, acting like total dorks in an effort to be funny (they have their moments) and thankfully showing us all sorts of neat things about the making of the film. You are given the chance to \\"Choose Your Groove,\\" and you can either experience a documentary that combines segments from several different sections into one big featurette, or you can explore the individual sections so that you can also enjoy the galleries and other tidbits included. The sections are: \\"Development,\\" which holds \\"The Process\\" and \\"The Research Trip\\" shorts, as well as a readable story treatment, a visual development gallery, and a gallery on the original version of the film (Kingdom of the Sun); \\"Story and Editorial,\\" which consists of  more of \\"The Process,\\" a storyboard Pitch (3-versions in fact!), and \\"Deleted and Unused Scenes\\" (including one that is fully animated!); \\"Layouts and Backgrounds,\\" which uses featurettes and galleries to take us into scene planning, a storyboard and background comparison, layouts, and all that good stuff; \\"Animation,\\" which uses featurettes and comparisons, gives us some voice actor interviews, and that great character design stuff I love so much (there's loads of stuff here!); \\"Putting It All Together,\\" which has an \\"Ink and Paint/Composition\\" featurette, Color Models, and a clean-up animation to ink and paint comparison; \\"Music and Sound,\\" which holds a \\"Music and Sound Effects\\" featurette, Sting's video for \\"My Funny Friend and Me,\\" and a Mixing Demo you can play with; \\"Publicity,\\" the last section, holds trailers, TV spots, and a poster and ad gallery.<br /><br />As you can see, the 2-disc set is a gold mine for the \\"Emperor's New Groove\\" fan.

0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is an incredible book about an old man's walk through death and the lessons learned by a young friend who watched him die. Mitch Albom is a young sports writer for the Detroit Fress Press,who had Morrie Schwartz as a Professor in college nearly twenty years ago. One night while flicking through the t.v. stations Mitch caught his old professor on Ted Koppel's &quot;Nightline&quot;. What he hears stuns him.  His old professor is dying of ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease. It is a slow killing neurological disease. Mitch, a world weary,cynical man ,goes to visit Morrie. This begins the first of many Tuesday visits with his old professor. Morrie teaches Mitch about the meaning of life and not to fear death. One of my favoite quotes is &quot;Money is not a substitue for thenderness, and power is not a substitute for tenderness. I can tell you,as I'm sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither money nor power will give you the feeling you're looking for, no matter how much of them you have.&quot; Having just lost my mother, I really did not want to read this book. But, this was a required book in my English Comp. class. Thank God I was forced to read it,because it helped me face some issues in my own life. First and foremost, my mother's death. I recommend this book to anyone looking for the real answers to life.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This is one of the best action dramas I've EVER seen.  It crescendos into a huge climax that is nothing short of BRILLIANT! HEAT has all the components in my opinion of a movie masterpiece. It moved me so that at the end of the movie, I immediately wrote a poem about it off the top of my head.<br />Pacino and De Niro play two men on opposite sides of the law that are both one hundred and ten percent dedicated to their work. Al is the cop, Robert the &quot;bad guy.&quot; I must say he is the easiest &quot;bad guy&quot; to not only like but respect.<br />As the movie progresses the viewer discovers that Vincent (Al) and Neil (Robert) have more in common than anyone, especially they, realize. Chapter 26 &quot;An invitation to coffee&quot; and Chapter 27 &quot;A couple of regular fellows&quot; is unlike anything I've ever seen, totally original and amazing. Vincent: &quot;I don't know how to do anything else.&quot;/Neil: &quot;Neither do I.&quot;/ Vincent: &quot;I don't much want to either.&quot;/Neil: &quot;Neither do I.&quot;<br />For the true action lovers out there, this is your movie! Chapters 3, 4, 15, 30-33 and the ending are for you! Regardless of your favorite type of movie, you will appreciate this one. THIS IS ESSENTIAL VIEWING! DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!<br />All the actors in this movie are top knotch: Val Kilmer (&quot;For me, the sun rises and sets without me.&quot;) Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, Tom Sizemore,...I repeat EVERYONE! However, the character Waingro, to me is the main conflict in here that makes the movie so memorable.  Without him things would have been so much smoother for De Niro...but then it wouldn't have been so great a movie with such a remarkable ending. BRAVO TO MICHAEL MANN!<br />BLINDED BY THE LIGHT<br />Blinded by the Light; What is wrong or right? So compelling, can't keep score, Doesn't matter anymore.<br />Heat lasts until the end.

0446315028|4.0|Adam Dalgliesh, recovering from his illness, paid a dutiful visit to Father Badderly at Tonyton Village.  He found himself to be an unwilling spectator to four deaths.  In spite of his determination not to be involved, his detective instincts and skeptism were soon searching for the link and reasons behind the four seemingly straightforward deaths.<br />I find this book to be one of P D James¡¦ best.  The conclusion to the story was simply impressive.  As in all her books, this book is best not to be read in a hurry, it is beautiful to digest it slowly.  The beauty of it all is that it will make you hold your breathe even when you are turning the pages slowly, a most unusual feature for a thriller as exciting as this.
014100018X|4.0|Joanne Harris weaves a delightful story blending two sides of the story into one.  Our heroine, Vianne Rocher, brings comfort and a message of love and forgiveness to the people of Lansquenet.  She opens up a chocolate shop in full view of the very negative and slightly sinister village priest, Reynaud. <br />Vianne brings a mysterious past as well as her young daughter with her to Lansquenet. As our story unfolds the reader is quickly drawn into the battle waged against Vianne by Reynaud as well as the discovery of the secrets in each of their lives. Vianne accomplishes much by offering chocolat treats to the townspeople.  Her shop becomes a gathering place and a source of comfort to young and old.<br />The descriptions of chocolat confections created in Vianne's kitchen were mouth watering.  Readers should have chocolat on hand as they read or like this reader, will just have to pay a visit to the corner store.  <br />A joy to read.
B00004YKSD|5.0|I have been a true doors fan for some years. I am 15 years old, and I first discovered doors music when I would hear it coming from the room of my older brother when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I picked up these songs when I bought the doors first album when I was about 12 and it just clicked in and I remembered how all the songs sounded. This movie was also quite an inspiration to my devotion as a doors fan. Val Kilmer is excellent as Jim Morrison. Many negative reviews are written about how Oliver Stone didn't &quot;accurately&quot; portray the doors. The fact is that everyone has there own opinion about how Jim Morrison was and how he acted and that is was Oliver Stone did when he made the film. It was based on what he felt the doors and Jim Morrison were like. Jim had many many sides to him, crazy, funny, caring, kind, happy, dark, etc. I believe that the doors will always be my absolute most favorite band because of there unique sound, exceptional lyrics, and incredible singer/poet.

B00005A1PR|2.0|While India.Arie does deliver &quot;acoustic soul&quot; as the title of the album promises, this cd falls short of delivering the complex and unique sounds of other &quot;neo-soul&quot; artists such as Jill Scott or Erykah Badu.  India.Arie has a sultry and beautiful voice, and it is apparent that she is a strong black woman deeply proud of her spiritual and ancestral roots.  However, sometimes her lyrics come across as more preachy than proud.  I also thought that her lyrics were trite and over simplified.  There is more to songwriting than making sure the words rhyme.  The first three tracks after the Intro, &quot;Video&quot;, &quot;Promises&quot;, and &quot;Brown Skin&quot; are the strongest tracks on the cd.  But as I continued to listen, my excitement dwindled.  Ms. Arie is a talented young woman, but she needs to work on her songwritting skills, and perhaps find stronger production.  I believe her sophomore effort will be better.

0375501851|4.0|Does anyone ever wonder about his or her own teeth?  As a baby you didn't have teeth, but as you start growing up teeth begin to appear and soon after they fall out again.  As an adolescent you start to grow in your permanent set of teeth.  Of course teeth are white.  But do teeth stay white all through out your life?  I`m pretty sure factors may influence the color of one's teeth...smoking, drinking coffee, not drinking enough calcium could be a few.  Basically, as life goes on, so do your teeth.  Your teeth now do not appear as they did ten years ago, but does anything stay the same for that long of a time?  Cars change styles, not to mention clothing.  Most importantly people change within time.  A person's viewpoint changes dramatically over a period of time.  As a young person, one's mind is not yet developed and their kind of thinking is basic.  As we grow up we learn many things about society, culture, and especially, ourselves.  Some may not see it, but teeth and identity come hand in hand.  In the book White Teeth, Zadie Smith tells a story of two families struggling to make the best lives for their children.  As most children, all of them grow up searching for their own identity.  Millat and Magid, twins of Bangladeshi immigrants Samad and Alsana, grow up with the companionship of Irie, daughter of Archie and Clara Bowden.  Samad sends one of his twins, Magid, back to Bangladesh in order to save him from the corruption of Western civilization.  Millat, the other twin that stays behind, becomes much of a rebel in his neighborhood.  Much of his activities includes smoking marijuana, causing havoc, and having promiscuous sex.  Above all he becomes very involved with  a Muslim activist group.  Irie, on the other hand, goes through many changes in the novel.  She grows up struggling with feelings of inadequacy brought on by her multicultural background being that of English and Jamaican.  The pressures of Western civilization cause her to try to straighten hernatural, curly Jamaican hair.  When Magid comes back from Bangladesh, it is odd that he is more English than Muslim.  Zadie Smith allows us to step in these children's lives and follow with them the search for their own identity.  Being brought up from different cultures in a foreign land allows these children to be strong-minded and unbiased.  Smith has portrayed their lives in a way that others can seem to relate.  As stated in the beginning, teeth change over time.  We see in this novel that the lives of Millat, Magid, and Irie change over time also.  This novel helps us realize that a child's life is a very dramatic one, and sometimes taken for granted.
068818071X|4.0|I liked Rachel's Holiday quite a bit, though I have to admit that I didn't know that it was about a young woman's treatment for drug addiction when I started it. I had read Marian Keyes' two previous books, and liked them well enough to buy this one. I was pleasantly surprised! Rachel's Holiday features Rachel Walsh, sister of Claire, the heroine of Watermelon, Marian Keyes' first novel (and in my opinion, best). She's hustled back to Dublin by her family after she takes an almost fatal overdose of drugs when she's living in New York City. The book is a painful look at how debilitating drug addiction can be, and focuses on the incredibally strong stance of denial that Rachel takes when she first enters the treatment center. The novel follows her through her weeks there, and Keyes does a geat job of describing all of the eccentric characters that Rachel meets at The Cloisters, her drug rehab center. The book also follows Rachel after she is released from The Cloisters and is faced with the challenges of reality once again. Rachel's Holiday is not as laugh-out-loud funny as Watermelon nor as silly as Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, but it's a nice, relaxing read nonetheless.
0425173739|5.0|In this novel, one of Christie's best, she took a love story and made it into a murder mystery. A honeymoon cruise where the beautiful bride is murdered is just the beginning of a story filled with suspects, red herrings, and subplots.<br />Jacqueline de Bellefort is a poor orphan whose best friend at school is the beautiful and wealthy Linnet Ridgeway.  When Jacqueline becomes engaged to Simon Doyle, she convinces her friend Linnet to hire him as her estate agent.  Only tragedy can ensue when Linnet and Simon fall madly in love and Simon marries Linnet, not Jacqueline.  The jilted Jacqueline shows up at every stop on Linnet and Simon's honeymoon, but on the last leg of the trip, a cruise down the Nile, Linnet's patience has worn thin.<br />Added to this intriguing scenario are a cast of interesting cruisemates including Hercule Poirot who is taking a well-deserved holiday and Colonel Race who has appeared in earlier Christie works.  Also on board are an anxious American lawyer with questionable financial dealings, a British solicitor, a mother traveling with her grown daughter, and another mother traveling with her grown son.  These and others make this sailing of the Karnak one you don't want to miss.<br />This novel was brought to the big screen in 1978 with Peter Ustinov as Poirot, David Niven as Colonel Race,  Mia Farrow as Jacqueline, and Lois Chiles as Linnet.  Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Maggie Smith, George Kennedy, and other Hollywood notables also starred.
6304077939|3.0|I don't quite understand all the praise this movie is getting here.  I'm a big fan of art films, foreign films (surtout les filmes en francais), etc.-- so, no this isn't the criticism of someone who wants to see Van Damme wreak destruction, to watch Julia Roberts' insipidity, or other stuff typical of Hollywood fare. Certainly, &quot;Leolo&quot; is an interesting art movie in a surreal sort of way-- and sure, there are quite a few memorably disturbing scenes, such as young Leolo masterbating with a piece of old liver that he keeps in the toilet reservoir, or the fact that the father's so concerned with the defecatory habits of everyone in the family that he inspects after they use the toilet.  I suppose these, and other bits could be kind of funny in an overblown, Freudian psychoanalytical dark comedy sort of way (which is exactly what I liked about &quot;Toto le Hero&quot; and &quot;The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and her Lover&quot;), but &quot;Leolo just didn't make me laugh.  Nor did it make me cry-- or wince-- or really provoke any real reaction whatsoever.  It just made me feel kind of bored, and only a bit puzzled.  Maybe was just in the wrong mood when I saw this-- or maybe I missed something-- but to be honest, I just didn't think it was particularly interesting.
B00004XQ83|5.0|In response to a previous reviewer's question, that is reallyTim Blake Nelson the actor singing. However, he only sang for the movie. He begged the Coen brothers to let him do so, because he's been a big fan of mountain music since childhood. The soundtrack was his first time recording music. As for the soundtrack itself, I think it's wonderful. Even though it still isn't getting a lot of popular airplay (at least not in LA), it is wonderful! Every song is beautifully rendered, and the authentic 1930's machines really add depth. A great album all on its own, and definitely the best soundtrack I've ever heard.

What makes the movie even worse than it should be is the Letterbox format and Al Pacino's awful hairpiece. Don't waste your time with this thing unless your're looking for a good unintentional laugh.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a great action, mystery, and romance story. I loved the animation and the characters. I just recently watched it in Japanese, and it was totally awesome. I especially love the music(my fave is Princess Mononoke, or so it's called). It's so haunting and riveting, that's what makes this a great movie!
B00004XQ83|5.0|W. Eatmon wrote asking for information regarding the song &quot;He's in the Jailhouse Now&quot;.  I grew up listening to this song as well.  My mother had this on an album by the late Jimmy Rogers.  She had become a fan as a young child from listening to the victrola at her grandparents home in Texas.   I may be wrong, but I believe he may have been the singer you are thinking of.  He was famous for his many &quot;railroad&quot; songs, and was popular during the late 1920's and early 1930's. Hope this was of some help!   And, regarding &quot;O, Brother Where Art Thou&quot;....this is a fabulous CD!!  I love every minute of it.
B000002BHE|5.0|Being a huge Celine Dion fan, I have all of her CDs and FIY is one of my top three faves. Here's a rundown of the songs:<br />1. It's All Coming Back to me Now - This song is loud, but it's really good. Celine sings it with a powerful voice and this song prooves what a strong voice she has.<br />2. Because You Loved Me - the love theme to Up Close and Personal. It was overplayed on the radio when the movie came out, but it's still a great song.<br />3. Falling Into You - has a great beat, awesome song.<br />4. Make You Happy - Very catchy, you'll be singing along to it in no time.<br />5. Seduces Me - a very sexy song, great vocals.<br />6. All By Myself - Personally I think Celine does a better job than Eric Carmen or whoever it was that sung this song before her.<br />7. Declaration of Love - kind of reminds me of a poppish country song. Very cute and fun.<br />8. Dreaming of You - I luv this song even though it may sound too bubble gummish.<br />9. I Love You - reminds me of a 50s song, but very awesome. <br />10. If That's What It Takes - this is the English version of &quot;Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore&quot; (I like the French version better)<br />11. I Don't Know - Awesome song! Another one that showcases her strong vocal skills.<br />12. River Deep, Mountain High - Okay, I'm going to get shredded for this, but I like her version better than Tina Turner's.<br />13. Call the Man - I didn't like this song at first, but it grew on me.<br />14. Fly - very sweet spiritual song dedicated to her niece who died.
0399146253|3.0|I used to be an avid reader of Patricia Cornwell, that is until recently. The last 3 books have been a great disappointment. The characters Kay, Lucy and Marino are wonderful, but the story line needs work... lots of it. I used to wait in anticipation for her next book, but now I find myself having to make myself read. The book does not really deserve the rating I gave, but the characters are so great that I thought they deserved credit for showing up.
0156907399|5.0|&quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; reads like a dream.  By that, I mean Woolf's writing has a dreamlike, impressionistic quality that uses little dialogue.  The novel is about several English people who spend their summers in the Hebrides, islands northwest of Scotland.  The lighthouse mentioned in the title is located on one of the islands and symbolizes a goal or an ideal to which several of the characters aspire in one way or another.<br />The most prominent characters are the Ramsay family, whose internal conflicts form the basis for their existence, much like any other nuclear family.  Mr. Ramsay is a philosophy professor, an imperious man who dreams of being remembered for his work and enjoys laying down the law with his children.  Mrs. Ramsay's love for her husband has dwindled to the point of her not being sure why she ever fell in love with him in the first place, but she is enamored with the *idea* of being in love, always looking forward to her single friends getting married. <br />The central character, however, is a woman named Lily Briscoe who paints canvases of an apparently abstract nature.  Her conflict appears in the form of a character named Charles Tansley, an unsociable chauvinist who admonishes her that &quot;women can't paint, women can't write.&quot;  Lily Briscoe's efforts to paint represent the difficult, introspective process of artistic creation.  <br />In combining the themes represented by Lily and the Ramsays, Woolf portrays the problems of being a woman artist in a society that discouraged women to be artistic or creative (the discouragement represented by the voice of Tansley) and therefore having to deal with the disappointment and frustration of conflicting with social mores (illustrated by Mrs. Ramsay's discontent in her marriage).  However, Lily triumphs in completing her painting at the end, as Woolf triumphs in completing her novel.
0800141628|5.0|This movie was great. Iloved it..............             Did you?
B000059Z8J|5.0|So why is this so good eh? Well the other reviews tell you the story line but the amazing thing about this is that: 1) This film was produced around 1978, and when you consider this the special effects are really outstanding. 2) It has one of the best film scores of all time in dolby! 3) It has arguably the best Superman actor of all time - Christopher Reeve 4) It has some phenomonal DVD extras including Christopher Reeves' screen test, why Margot Kidder deserved to be Lois Lane, and one of the best additional screens (fire and ice) since the Aliens special edition.<br />The film was superbly written, and linked flawlessly to Superman II (lets hope a special edition for this one is on it's way too), Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando are also brilliant.  But then the whole cast play their parts so well...<br />And most importantly, although the film has a little fun it doesn't become childish, it keeps to a mature level (shame about III and IV - but then the same thing happened to the Batman and Robocop sequels).  They could do to Superman I and II in the same way Star Wars was recently brought back to the cinema as a whole generation have missed the chance to see these two films the way they should be seen - but the DVD makes up for this.<br />This is truely a classic and if you watch it with this in mind, you will enjoy it, the &quot;who's got you&quot; scene is classic (notice the &quot;I don't think so&quot; look from Christopher Reeve at the phone box, Supermans traditional &quot;changing room&quot;) and John Williams score is a masterpiece (especially the scene noted here). To kids, the beginning may seem slow, but adults will understand how the film builds up and explains the influences that will affect Superman's life - ENJOY!
0060977493|5.0|If you expect a candy coated fantasy story where everything comes out allright in the end - then run away.  If you expect a book which will put everything into plain English and use correct grammar - then run away.  If you expect a story that is morally and religiously proper, again, I plead you to run away . <br />However, if you are inclined to read books which portray the reality and darker side of every society, then read this.  I grew up in this land where Ms. Roy's book is set.  What she speaks of is the truth, which apparently, many reviewers can't handle.  Her style of writing is beautiful, unique, fragmented, and awesome.  Time jumps back and forth, but any reader who's paying attention can easily keep track.<br />I enjoyed this book partucularly due to Roy's inventive and creative style of writing and her sense of irony.  At times the writing is so stunning, it'll make you wonder how a person learns to be so fluid and imaginative.<br />A must read.  I rank it up there with my other favorites, The Old Man and the Sea, and To Kill a Mocking Bird.
B000050IMJ|3.0|OK, this film had a lot of hype in front of it, and sad to say, it didn't live up. If you watched this movie without seeing the original, you might enjoy it. But I gotta tell ya, this chase scene compared to the original......well there is no comparison. This one uses who knows how many Shelby GT's to make the chase scene and also uses computer graphics. The original, on the other (better) hand, used ONE for the whole chase! It was torn up at the end, but it ran. The ONLY thing better about the new one is the acting (what little there is). The first one lacked a script and the acting was horrendous, but the chase scene..oh my, the chase scene!! Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen either one, see the first one. If you've seen this one and thought it was good, you MUST see the original!
B00003CXB7|5.0|This movie is one of my faves,20th Cent.Fox own the rights so get it out on dvd with a making of,commentary by Altman etc!
B00004XONN|5.0|This is one of the greatest CDs that I have in my collection (if it is not the best), it's totally different album. The album is just beautiful I mostly listen to it when I am stressed and in less of 5 seconds of &quot;Everything in its right place&quot; all my worries go away. Every song is different but in some way they are connected, maybe because of the lyrics. The album uses lots of electronic mixed voices and things like that that give the music a really relaxing sound. In this album you can see that Thom Yorke has one of the greatest voices, in some songs his voice is electronicly changed, but it still shows what a great voice he has. It is very difficult to discribe the sound because is nothing compared to what is on the market right now.<br />The first time you listen to the album you might not like it because it sounds too strange, you might even think that it is not Radiohead, but listen to it a few times and you will not be able to take it out of the CD-Player.<br />The songs are not of the commercial thing, they probably won´t be played too much on the radio, and they don't have catchy chorus, but that is one of the things I most like, because it doesn't stick on your head it just relaxes you into another world.
0451196716|5.0|I've read a lot of books in my time. Horrors, mysteries, fantasies, you name it. I've read long books and short books. I've read classics and the latest thing. When it comes to the last page of a book, I thought I had experienced it all. But that was before I read &quot;The Long Walk.&quot; When I finished it I felt a sensation I had never had before at the end of a story: exhaustion. I was TIRED! Though I had not walked one single step, my feet were sore. I was hungry, thirsty, aching, and worn out. That is what King's story will do to you if you wisely choose to read it. You will walk every step with these young kids, go with them through their trials and fears. The miles will pass for you, too, as you see them die and fall to the wayside. For days after I read it I couldn't walk anywhere without wondering what it would be like to never stop, to walk all day and all night. It makes having to park a few extra slots away from the store seem not that bad. Get this book. Experience it for yourself. You won't regret it. This isn't just a story. It is an event. The gameshow Survivor has NOTHING on this contest.
0671027344|5.0|Ok, after browsing my school library this thin book caught my attention at the top of a shelf, and after taking it down and reading the title I just knew I would love it.  And you will too!  Seriously, this is a great book for any teenager, especially those of you who have ever felt out of place, or have had trouble making friends.  You will fall in love with the main character, Charlie, and just want to know everything about his sometimes, sad, depressing life.  Believe me, this is not a book that is just waiting to disappoint you, this book is going to move you and if you're the depressed, I hate life type, you will soon think differenly about life and think &quot;Hmm...maybe things aren't so bad&quot; and you'll start looking for the good things.  Read this book, or else!!
B00003CXRP|2.0|To say this move was bad is not enough.  Cast Away depicts Tom Hanks as the lone survivor of a plane crash stranded on a remote deserted island.  If you've seen the previews or TV commercials for this movie, you would then also know that he somehow finds a way back to civilization.  You would know that he was away for 4 years.  I did see this movie in the theaters hoping that there was more to the movie than I saw in the commercials.  I was sadly disappointed.      Cast Away starts slowly given that we are all waiting for Hanks to crash land alone.  Following his being stranded, Hanks engages in what can be best described as a mediocre slapstick routine  showing a slow adjustment to the island.  Fast-forward 4 years and Hanks is ready to get off the island... well, at least we're ready to see him get off the island since we all know he's going to somehow escape.     As is Robert Zemeckis' other recent movie, \\"What Lies Beneath,\\" too much is given away in the trailers.  Indeed, the mystery of the movie no longer becomes whether or not he will make it back, but, in my mind, what is in that last FedEx box that he doesn't open.  Sadly, Zemeckis leaves this to the imagination of the viewer.      This is not a movie you need to see more than once.  It's barely a movie you see even once.  Seen the trailer?  If so, that's all you need to know.
B000002H97|5.0|This is TRUELY the Metallica album. This album has the BEST Metallica songs on it by far. If you get a Metallica album, you HAVE to get this one.
0451197968|4.0|When I read this story several years ago, I found it to be a good read. Not the best, certainly, but it was a great way to spend my afternoon. I had just discovered King's Bachman books, and I was amazed to see that the movie &quot;The Running Man&quot; was actually based on one of those stories. I had enjoyed the movie (hey, I was a teen in the eighties, and Arnold movies were my life's blood), so I was hopeful that the book would be as good. Well, the movie and the story are worlds apart, but luckily the book far surpassed the movie in every way (don't they always?). <br />But now, looking back on the game show crazy that has developed over the past few years, and how crazy they have gotten (namely, shows like Survivor and Boot Camp come to mind), the story now seems eerily prescient. Could we be headed toward a Running Man type game show, where death is a possibility? Three years ago I would have said no. Now? Now it doesn't seem so fantastic anymore. Anyway, read this story. It might just tell the future...
B000002G7E|5.0|Every band that dares call themselves &quot;alternative&quot; owes it all to this set. from the Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine to Television and the New York Dolls to Radiohead. Keeping as a base the idea of &quot;white noise&quot;, Lou Reed and Co. rip through their songs like the Hell's Angels at an accountant's convention. Viva La Rock!
B00005JG6U|5.0|&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; was a movie that grabs you from the very beginning and doesnt let you go for months.  If you asked me what was better, the acting, the story, the directing, or the music, I honestly couldnt tell you, because they are all absolutly amazing.  Ellen Burstyn gives an absolutly stellar performance as Sarah Goldfarb, a woman addicted not only to diet medication, but to the pursuit of the spotlight.  Watching this film, I had to wonder if she was really acting, that is how great she was.  Jared Leto plays her son, Harry, a small time addict who will do anything for a fix, and along with his friend, played magnificantly by Marlon Wayans, finds a way to make it for himself, along with his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely.  The film then follows each of these characters in their own personal journey and subsequent decay to addiction and dependency.  Darren Aronofsky, the director of &quot;Pi&quot; turns out a brilliant film worthy of mountains of praise and accolades.  Unfourtunatly, because this film is not rated, and is far too deep to be understood by &quot;society,&quot; it will never get the praise it deserves.  Do not let my words fall on deaf ears, get this movie yourself.
B00005221L|5.0|The DTS version is great. Old version ( DD 5.1 ) just didn't measure up. It just rocks my apartment ( wife hates it ).
014100018X|3.0|I was really disappointed in this book, especially since I loved the movie.  It lacks all of the charm and lightheartedness of the movie and is instead dark and sad.  As one reviewer said, the writing isn't as good as it could be.  Therefore, instead of being subtle and seductive, it's boring.  If you love &quot;Chocolat&quot; you'll have a better time seeing the movie again than reading the book.
B0000033J9|5.0|Maurice Jarre's stunning score to the film DOCTOR ZHIVAGO ranks as one of the finest soundtracks ever composed. Grand, memorable, and powerful, Jarre's acheivement captures the agony of revolutionary Russia and complements brilliantly the epic production of Metro Goldwyn Mayer.<br />Jarre's score involves a use of several leitmotifs, Lara's Theme being the most famous, which bind each piece into the larger whole of the film. That Jarre was able to accomplish this is all the more surprising because, as he states in the CD booklet, he had only 6 weeks to compose the film score.<br />The production of the soundtrack is crystal-clear and strong. The drums are crisp and reverberant, and the elements of the orchestra is balanced on the recording.<br />For those who loved the film and its score, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is essential
B00005B6C9|3.0|Here's my problem, I'm still in love with the 60's Bee Gees. I liked their sparse recordings (pre-disco) when their guitar music complemented the beautiful harmony of their voices. The pace was a bit slow and gravitated toward the melancholy. I was prepared for similar so maybe it's my fault. This collection appears to be headed for a broader market. There is more depth to the music and the songs are generally upbeat. But most possess an uptempo tech sound reminiscent of a good Casio keyboard with the synthesized sound that rings false to my ears. I like the simplicity of their old standards where they sounded like an actual band with many hits incorporating a twangy guitar supporting an acoustic guitar backed by simple drums. These new  recordings are a montage of indisguishable instruments where twangy guitars could not exist. Also gone for the most part is the concept of harmony. Robin or Barry seem to have failed to show up for some songs altogether. Instead the background is sung by non Bee Gee members thus we rarely get to hear that great sound of their voices meshing together. The songs aren't bad at all and if I were not a 60's Bee Gee fan I might even like them. The song, &quot;Wedding Day&quot; is quite gorgeous where Barry and Robin sing different parts alternately. There is plenty of feeling in Robin's voice as he sounds like his &quot;old&quot; self. The title song is also good but you will not come across any old chestnuts here. I wanted to like this. But I wanted Barry and Robin to be on the same page, or at least in the studio at the same time.
B00005B1EX|5.0|but I have a quick question.  Does anyone know what is up with Heart of a Lion?  The liner notes say this song is cleaned up from an earlier demo, but I remember the exact same song being on the album &quot;Second Heat&quot; by Racer X, which i admit is actually (somewhere) in my house.  Thanks.
0060977264|4.0|This is a book written for all romantics at heart. Paulo Coelho has written another superb novel based on the power of love, faith and hope. This book is inspirational, and pushes us to believe and learn to recognise the little miracles that appear to us each day. Dreams do take hard work, patience and a lot of tears, but the author teaches us never to loose hope. Paulo manages to move and inspire through this story. Excellent! It made me trust in love again!
B000002UB3|4.0|This is an excellent album throughout.  Although there aren't a lot of phenomenally successful singles on this album, there is a lot of quality music, and you will find that you will listen to the entire album straight through instead of picking out a song or two here and there.  Specifically, tracks 9-the end all flow together seamlessly into one long piece of music, and you'll find each segment doesn't sound as good by itself.   I recommend this album to all Beatles fans.  I thought I could get by with only the greatest hits albums, but you miss a lot of good music that wasn't released to the radio, and the second half of this disk proves it.
B00003003R|4.0|Guns n' roses was an awesome band.  They had their ups and downs.  This 2-Cd set is a perfect example of this.  <br />Disc one is a great Cd. It has some great songs.  It truly shows off Axl Roses great stage personality.  Used To Love Her is a great improvement over the original.  This first disc is a classic, except for a few sound problems. <br />Disc Two has a lot of problems.  They try and make it seem like this is all part of one show.  The sound is pretty pathetic on most of the songs.  Sweet Child O' Mine is just plain pitiful. They should have picked another version to make it sound a lot better.  Paradise City kind of seems to drag on.  Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a positive on this disc which needs some retuneing.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana are an excellent band. Their sound was a mix of classic,punk, and blues rock that was very original. Of course, this sound has been imitated countless times since then, but Nirvana did it best. Now look what we have. Bands like Kid Rock and Nsync dominate our airwaves. No album of the 90's is as good as this (or In Utero for that matter). Ignore criticism towards this album, it is truly magnificent. The only albums in my collection to rival this are &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; by Metallica and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; by Pink Floyd. Buy this along with the rest of Nirvana's albums and prepare to be amazed by the musical and lyrical talent of one of the best bands of our time.
0783235968|5.0|I don't know what it is about this movie.  I am not a baseball fan, but there was something in it that made one of my all-time favorites.  Also, on the vhs version my parents had, there's a note at the end of the credits that says &quot;for our parents&quot;, I thought that was pretty cool.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar is the best book I have ever read. The book shows a great sense of feminism and feelings against men. The book explains very clearly the feelings that Plath has gone through. The scenes of suicide are powerful, and makes one look at why someone would desire to take their life. The book takes a look at depression, on a slightly darker scale. Parts of the book are so deep, that it draws the reader's emotions into the life of Esther, the main character of the book.Esther suffers depression, even though in the beginning of the book, she has almost every girls dream, to be living in New York City, for one month free, after winning a contest. The book takes a look at the darker moments in Esther's life, revealing her innermost thoughts, fears, and emotions. Plath's writing is able to make the reader break down along with Esther,  and her many faultering emotions. Most women will be able to relate with the ever changing emotions and easy annoyance that Esther goes through. Feeelings of lonlyness, rage, anger, jelousy, anxiety and distress have a great hold throughout the book.
B0000069NM|5.0|Scofield's strong guitar creativity is backed by unbelievable good drums by Martin.  This is solid funk jazz with some strong Latin/South American styles thrown in at times.<br />Really enjoy the cuts &quot;Jeep On&quot; and &quot;Green Tea.&quot;<br />A cut above some other rather trendly stuff.  This one stands alone, and many since have tried to copy this sound.
0792140346|5.0|PRIMAL FEAR is one of those movies where anything can happen,  and often does.  This eerie and intriguing tale of the murder of an archbishop and the trial of the accused choir boy is directed with skill and dexterity by Gregory Hoblit.  Martin Vale is a famous defense lawyer who takes it upon himself to defend the supposed murdering choir boy simpleton Aaron Stampler.  His former lover Janet will be the prosecutor against him in this all important trial.  Martin may think he has everything figured out,  but he soon discovers the terrible secret behind the innocent face of Aaron.  Richard Gere and Laura Linney give superior performances as Martin and Janet,  as well as John Mahoney and Frances Mcdormand in their supporting roles.  The real story is Edward Norton's incredible performance as Aaron.  He received an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actor for his role.  I am now officially a huge Ed Norton Fan!  I would love to give away the secret behind Aaron,  but you've got to see it to believe it!  Amazing Movie!
B00000JPH6|5.0|By far this is the star of my DVD collection.  I was exposed to this film as a child by my mother.  She often managed to find the most magical, fascinating, interesting stuff to show me.  &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; was no exception.  It's a magical journey that is bound to make you forget that it's actually a punch of puppets you are watching parading across the screen.  The viewer is grabbed into the world of the Dark Crystal.  It's a funny and exciting journey.  The DVD offers a chance to rediscover this childhood gem.  The new transfer is nothing short of breath takingly amazing.  I only saw the film on TV.  I remeber it being dark and grainy.  The new transfer is brilliant, vibrant and clear.  Some wonderful extras can be found on the DVD which help to enrich your viewing experience.  The deleted sequences offer some insight into new aspects of the film.  The Skesis funeral sequence juxtaposes interestingly against the laid back acceptance of death by the Ur'ru.  The featurette although dated offers some wonderful insight into the development of the film.  Overall this DVD offers almost a new experience when viewing the film despite having seen the film countless times before.  It has been, is and will always be a classic for all children and adults who are seeking a little magic in their lives.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is the dfinite Sex Pistols/raged/punk album you can get. I would say that the Sex Pistols are punk at its finest, but back then, It wasn't called punk. So, this is good fast hard rock. So many bands have covered their songs (Megadeth, Anthrax, Six Feet Under) and they do great jobs, but nothing beats the originals. Johny Rotten's voice is just killer. The guitaar playing is so easy, yet it still remains untouched. Green Day and the new Offspring are trying to be punk, but fail. This is DEFINITE punk. A classic. ANARCHY!
0793927501|5.0|Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin star in this non-stop action survival tale of men stuck in the middle of the Alaska wilderness with a man-hungry, stalking bear on there tail, and nowhere to turn.  Excellent scenic views of the Alaska frontier and just plain stunning action sequences make this film one of the best survival pictures ever made.  Superb acting on the parts of both Hopkins and Baldwin.  Hopkins, starring as the know-it-all rich guy,(As usual) takes it upon himself to pull the survivors of his plane reck into survival experts.  Baldwin, as the photographer sent up to take pictures of Hopkins's star model wife, goes along for the ride.  All in all, an amazing survival film, better then most or all of the genre.
B00000JJQK|5.0|That's about all one can really say. Beyond question, this is the single most perfect piece of music in the last 50 years. Experimental, accessable, listenable, and amazingly beautiful, Pet Sounds is destined to be listened to long after rock and even the album format have expired. Some critics have accurately stated that parts of this album are overly uniform, but I must contest this and point out that the music is supposed to be unified and, furthermore, that this unification gives Pet Sounds a sonic density which demands numerous listens. But don't take my word for it! Go out and buy it for yourself.
6303402348|5.0|People like the &quot;vile pile&quot; reviewer underestimate the message of this warm, kind movie. Don't people like you understand that there is not always a necessity for complex messages? The message is simple, like Forrest Gump himself: &quot;Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.&quot; Such wisdom, because it represents the sponaneoity and mystery of life.    We need more people like Forrest. Sure, he's simpleminded, but he has a huge heart. And I stress &quot;HUGE&quot;. He doesn't care what anyone thinks of him-because he doesn't know the difference, but that's what makes him so likable, because he can adapt easily under any kind of circumstance. He is never mean, stands up for the people he loves, has more determination than any one I've ever seen. He has such love, and he doesn't hold it all in. He is honest, but not insulting. There are more than enough scenes to show that Forrest is a rare spirit. Such as the little scene most people seem to have overlooked- the one when two black students are accepted into an all-white school and one of them drops her book while entering the building, and Forrest runs up to her and hands her the book. Who else would have had the chutzpah to do that? He also gives up a whole load of money to buy a shrimping boat, just because he promised his best friend who died in combat that they would have a boat someday. Most people might find this ludicrous, but I found it unbelievable. I, for one, would have never done that. And he's so modest about it, too- a quality that most people do not possess.  He is also overcome by compassion and love for his best friend, Jenny. I was asking the exact same question myself when Jenny said to Forrest: &quot;Why are you so good to me, Forrest?&quot; Jenny leaves him a number of times during the movie, but unlike many people, Forrest doesn't become hateful and bitter. He just keeps on thinking about her and loving her. <br /> Forrest, a simple minded man, with an I.Q. of 75, holds the key to all noble, shining parts of life. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and a love for simple, but memorable messages of life.
0812550757|3.0|I am currently reading Speaker For The Dead by Orson Scot Card.  I am disapointed in the way the book is reading.  I was hoping that the book Speaker For The Dead would pick up right were Ender's game left off.  But instead the book starts off talking about new characters and personally it is very hard and is not reading very fast.       after a few chapters into the book Ender finally comes into the book but does not have the charisma he had in Ender's Game.  In Ender's Game Ender was a very tough and brave young man.  By the end of Ender's Game Ender was a war hero and had a very good military mind. now Ender seems like he has become a woosie.
0679720200|4.0|Boy, this guy had quite a life - his mother passes, he gets into trouble with the law - and through it all he seems to be in a dream-like state.  This story follows the life of the main character through his trials and tribulations.  It definitely makes you appreciate your life...nothing could ever be as bad as this guys!!
0812550757|3.0|I am now reading Speaker, and right now it is very hard reading.  Other reviews that i have heard is that the book picks up in the middle of the book.  In the very beging of the book there are characters that were not in Ender's Game and it has me a little confussed.
158234082X|3.0|Until recently I had not read much non fiction or biographical work. I'm put off by the sheer self-indulgence of autobiography but read `Kitchen Confidential' after several friends had endlessly enthused about it. It's definitely an interesting story and Bourdain has without a doubt lead a fairly intense kind of life. If you are a regular restaurant goer you might be advised to give this a miss because you'll never be able to look at a menu again without some of Bourdain's gruesome details echoing through your skull, putting you off your food! Read this if you are entertaining the notion of opening your own restaurant or becoming a chef. There's some good advice in here regarding why you shouldn't be entertaining such a notion.
0790743523|5.0|...and that's a crying shame, because &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; is everything a movie should be and one of the greatest films ever to come out of Hollywood. This morality tale about three down-and-out Americans prospecting for gold in the Mexican mountains is a timeless story of friendship, greed and betrayal, wonderfully directed by John Huston and acted by Humphrey Bogart (in his best role ever), Tim Holt, and Huston's father, Walter Huston, who won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal as the old prospector (as did Huston Jr. for best director).  Bogart's descent into madness is an acting tour de force; it's too bad he and Huston didn't win a joint Oscar.  But there are so many Oscar-worthy performances in this film (I especially liked Alfonso Bedoya in the role of the bad guy Gold Hat) that they couldn't begin to hand out awards to everyone who deserved one.  There is not one thing I would change in this movie.  The ending is priceless.  Seeing all the gold blown back into the hills where it came from has the viewer collapsing with laughter along with Holt and Huston, even while we appreciate, along with them, their hard-won lesson.  This movie surely deserves a prominent place in any list of the ten best films of all time.
0553573403|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best fantasy novel I have ever read. All the hype, all the claims of greatness (mine included) are completely justified. This is the fantasy novel you have been waiting for, if like me, you are tired of the clich&eacute;s, hackneyed plots and ripped off characters abundant in so much of the fantasy published these days. Martin's novel is better than anything by Eddings or Jordan or Goodkind or Tolkien, for that matter. `A Game of Thrones' is for adults. The language is strong and violent like just about every character. Martin never shies away from showing the gruesome details - whether it's on the battle field or in the bedroom. Yes, this is another novel about Kings and Knights, Dragons and magic but Martin manages to take these tropes, turn them on their heads, and make them uniquely his own. The cast is huge, as is the setting. Martin takes the massive canvass he has created and makes it intimate by allowing the reader to get to know his characters thoroughly. You'll find yourself wondering which side in the game of thrones you should be on because Martin himself doesn't seem to make any judgments about his own creations. I only finished reading this first volume of `A Song of Ice and Fire' mere minutes ago and already I miss the characters and the intrigue. How long has been since you have said that about a fantasy novel?
B00003CWTI|4.0|Three unrelated &quot;strange but true&quot; stories-none of which have the slightest thing to do with this film-serve as an introduction.<br />Characters who don't even know each other sing in turn to the same Aimee Mann song. <br />People die; some deservedly, some not so deservedly. <br />People go on living.<br />And frogs fall from the sky. <br />Welcome to &quot;Magnolia,&quot; one of the most unique and rewarding filmgoing experiences you will ever have. Like &quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; the previous effort from director P.T. Anderson (and don't think the &quot;P.T.&quot; nickname is useless; all his films are basically circuses caught on camera), there is a multitide of characters, all of whom are wonderfully conceived and beautifully played. <br />Unlike &quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; though, the sly, hip tone is gone, replaced with an almost unending (and fascinating) series of vignettes about eight characters whose lives sort of weave into each others' in two loose groupings. <br />Listing the characters, and the way their lives interweave, would be a long exercise, and besides, it would spoil the fun of figuring out the labyrinthine relationships for yourself. Suffice it to say that the central themes of this film-guilt, redemption, fate, and forgiveness-are built around a plot that is at turns maddeningly dense, howlingly funny, and sad. In particular, the ending sequence, which could have been a feel-good mess in the wrong hands, strikes just the right note of love's beauty-and its uncertainty.<br />Say what you will about &quot;Magnolia,&quot; but give Anderson credit for one thing: he swings for the fences, and about 80% of the time, he hits home runs; moreover, you can tell that he and the cast had an absolute blast. <br />If the other 20% of the long-ball attempts-the excessive length, the endlessly moving and zooming camera work, to name two-don't quite work, that's fine. The other 80%-including the wonderful work from the cast (especially from Tom Cruise)-is so fascinating, fresh, and genuine, that you can't help but be swept up in it.<br />Invest some time, and an open mind, in this film and you may well have a truly unique film experience; on the other hand, you may hate it. Like the film itself (and life itself), the reaction you may have to &quot;Magnolia&quot; is anything but predictable, but that's the beauty of art and life, is it not?
B00004Z4WR|1.0|the plot has been explored by recent reviews. about the cast... how can you have Nicholas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall and come up with this piece of moviemaking? it's really incredible! the story could work but the movie itself doesn't. Angelina Jolie barely appears, the special effects sure are nice if you believe that a car can fly... Bullitt with Steve McQueen is the real deal- it has the best car chase, a realistic one, that is. With a very similar car, too. (Ford Mustang). Now they have technology, great. But like it's used in this movie it doesn't work at all.  Being an Angelina Jolie fan i'm terribly disappointed- what is she doing in this film!?
B00000BKDW|4.0|I first heard this record in 1985, just after its release, and it was my intorduction to Iron Maiden. I have always said that this one is my favorite, but it is possibly due to it being my &quot;first&quot; Maiden record. I also saw them on this tour when they came to South Florida, and still, I maintain that was their best tour. After Powerslave, I started to backtrack with Number of the Beast and Piece of mind, and then further into the Dianno years. I feel that Maiden as a band was better with Dianno, but it is quite clear that Dickenson is superior and this record is their highlight. Ancient Mariner is to Maiden as &quot;Stairway&quot; is to Zeppelin, of course without all the airplay. Well, Get this record of your a Maiden fan in any way, and I guarentee you won't be disappointed!
0671004611|1.0|Corso knows nothing!  All the government released documents indicate nothing that would lead one to believe that a UFO crashed at Roswell.  There is no evidence in this book that one could examine to see if a UFO crashed at Roswell.  THINK!  Could the U.S. Government, with civilians who were present at Roswell, hide a UFO?  Could the U.S. Government seal the lips of hundreds of people present at Roswell?  NO WAY!  Corso has nothing.  This book is total hype with no evidence (hard fact).
6302814359|2.0|Return of the Living Dead is an awsome zombie film that I wish would really get re-released on video and DVD. Return of the Living Dead Part II is another one of those sequels that doesn't measure up. ROTLD2 does relie more on comedy than horror, but it ain't no Evil Dead II. ROTLD2 still has it's funny moments, but overall the film is corny and laughable (Especially the Michael Jackson zombie scene, corny). If you like zombie films, checks ROTLD2 out, otherwise steer clear.
0684853523|5.0|I was very surprised that this turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read in my entire life. I'd never read any of Stephen King's novels before and after completing this one I've purchased several of his works. It may sound incredibly sappy but as I read this book I was just in awe. It was an amazing combination of King's life story and his beautiful/sometimes humorous writing tips. I'm very glad that for some unknown reason I decided to buy this book &amp; I hope others will enjoy it half as much as I did.
B00004STPT|5.0|Film soundtracks do not always transfer well to CD. Stripped of the pictures it supports, even good film music often seems aimless. That is not the case here. The drama of the film is communicated with no loss of impact. Tracks 9, 12 and 15 -17 are particularly effective. Why didn't this win the soundtrack Oscar?
0887307280|5.0|This book is written for the battle scarred business owner. If you have had your business running for a few years and feel like its time to throw it all away since you feel that the business is eating you alive ...... READ THIS BOOK!

0140186409|4.0|The scope of this work far exceeds any novel I've ever read.  In this magnum opus by John Steinbeck, he covers theology, philosophy, history, sociology, class struggle, and an awesome breadth of the topics of man.  His attention to detail gives the strangest sensation that I am actually there in the wagon with the Joads, giving a personal feel to the novel that is untouchable by any other writer out there.  Certain images are absolutely unforgettable: Pa's last stand, Rose's lasting image, the spell-binding oratories of Tom, Ma, and Jim.<br />On the other hand, John Steinbeck knows this is magnum opus, but he sets out on a course to prove it to the reader.  He can be pedantic, didactic, and overbearing in his writing.  He is so absolutely blatant in his symbolism (particularly his religious symbolism) so as to leave a bitter feeling in the reader that the author thinks him a fool.  Steinbeck can seem a times as if he's WORKING to create a great work, utterly unnatural.<br />Looking past these misgivings though, this book is an excellent exploration into the 1930s as well as human nature in general.  The characters are spellbinding, their dialogue excellent.  The intercleary chapters are for the most part excellent snapshots of time, with the exception of those that involve absolutely blatant symbolism.  While the progress of the book can be a tad on the slow side, I find that it gives the book an excellent feel of rambunctous wandering and exploring a la Ruthie, physically, and a la Jim Casy, spiritually.  The status of this novel as a classic is wholly deserved, and it is also deserved of several readings to capture the full breadth of the novel.
6305657947|3.0|People seem to be all over the map with regard to this movie. I can only add that it's the sort of film you could watch when nothing else is at hand. I did catch some outright inaccuracies, and since &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; purports to be about art theft (among other things), the makers of this retread need an education.<br />The painting that Pierce Brosnan steals is a Monet, but it does not hang in the location shown in the Metropolitan Museum. In one scene, a group of bored schoolkids is told by their teacher &quot;it's worth a hundred million dollars,&quot; which could hardly be the case, since few Impressionist pieces have sold for that amount - and besides, this one work of Monet's is far from being a masterpiece.<br />Another quibble I have is when Brosnan rips the painting out of its frame and jams it into a briefcase, then calmly makes off with it during the confusion of the opening scenes. We see a normal-sized briefcase, and yet the canvas is on an oversized frame. Are we supposed to believe that a hundred-year-old oil painting can just be folded to fit into a smaller case? Later, when Crown places the stolen art in a wall niche to admire it, it appears uncreased. Please. The varnish alone would have splintered after so many decades. <br />The plot itself is problematic. If Crown is such a self-assured and wealthy man, why resort to stealing? He trashes a racing cattamaran for the thrill of getting wet, but to risk a felony arrest? The whole business with Rene Russo being over 40 and shaking her stuff is nauseating. So she looks good after a certain age. Is that a revelation? Frankly, her acting is a bit overdone. I travel and get jet-lagged, but I don't make a big production of it. <br />Other than that, it's a clever film in spots. I just wish that the writers would follow through and make it more believeable. Another film, the awful &quot;Entrapment,&quot; showed how Catherine Zeta-Jones' character stole a priceless Rembrandt (she mailed itusing the museum's own mailroom). Now that's neat.
B000002UVX|5.0|I bought this cd for one reason. That reason being Machine Gun. I haven't even heard any of the other songs yet I value this as my favorite cd. Machine Gun is over 12 min long. In this song, You experience what Hendrix has to offer all wrapped up in one song. Great lyrics, great guitar riffs and solos, and great vocals by Jimi. And Jimi's guitar reminds you of a victim of a Machine Gun blast. It shoots you down as you wail, and you can almost feel the pain.<br />Jimi's performance on Machine Gun far surpasses that of The star spangled banner at woodstock. Because in the national anthem (as good as Jimi made it) goes on and off and back on again. Machine Gun is one steady, mood setting, rock song.<br />I'm sure the other songs on the cd are great. But everytime I have this cd in my stereo or in my walkman, I have track #2 repeated over and over. Since it is a 12+min song, and the cd is $14+, It's been more than a dollar a minute song. But it is worth so much more.
0062502182|5.0|By telling this story in such a deceptively simple fashion, Coelho makes it universally acceptable and, unfortunately, easy to dismiss. I found this to be an amazing story of following one's heart to fulfill one's destiny. The use of metaphors is masterful; I found myself constantly pausing to consider a turn of phrase, a conversational point, a moment of action. I disagree with the reviewer who described this book as not life-changing. Like Daniel Quinn's &quot;Ishmael&quot;, this can be a single step along one's path to a better vision of the world. The lessons the world has to tell us are simple, but actually listening to them is the difficult part.
0141000198|3.0|I found this book to be very quick and easy reading. I found myself laughing throughout the book and could relate to Bridget very well. I love Bridget's wry sense of humor and often bizarre way of looking at life. This is a very lighthearted book and I highly recommend it. I actually read the book after seeing the movie and was surprised to find that the movie sticks pretty close to the book.
B000002U8G|5.0|This came just 2 years prior to DSOM and for my money, ranks right up with it. I have to admit being biased toward anything From &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; on back. I feel that Waters' ego just got too big after that and the music began to follow a formula. On &quot;Meddle&quot; the band was still experimenting with different styles and effects and for me it makes a much more interesting listen than  let's say, &quot;Animals&quot;.<br />&quot;Echoes&quot; is far and away my all time favorite Pink Floyd piece.<br />Ambience was a term that was unheard of in Rock way back in 71 and it is used here to great effect. The influence of &quot;Echoes&quot; is still reverberating 30 years after the fact in today's ambient/electronica sounds.  The remastering job on this album is remarkable. From the opening sound of blowing wind on &quot;One Of These Days&quot; to the errie voice tape effects that close the album on &quot;Echoes&quot; this is truly a sonic masterpiece. If all you're familiar with from Pink Floyd is their output from 73 to the present, then you owe it to yourself to listen to this.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Billy once said that when he's sad and meloncholic he writes the comedies, and when he's joyous and exuberant he writes the dramas. So what state was he in when he and Diamond wrote this masterpiece; not necessarily a comedy and not necessarily a drama - just like life, which is truly Wilder's greatest gift as a filmmaker.<br />Perhaps at the top of his game when he made this, Wilder handles every scene with the deft perfection that only a handful of directors could do. I saw this film back in '98 when Curtis Hanson (of L.A. Confidental and Wonder Boys) screened a glorious print at UCLA, and Wilder's command of the widescreen image for a &quot;contained&quot; film is beyond brilliant. It's almost a shame to see this film on a TV (widescreen or not). The snappy writing and honest performances from Lemmon and McClaine easily belong as part of the hi-lites of their careers. Seeing Fred McMurray play the role of the scandalous cad is another masterstroke (remember Wilder first worked with McMurray in Double Indemnity), and the supporting work by Ray Walston rounds out a perfect-pitch picture the likes we'll never again.<br />Astoundingly based on true life events of Hollywood during the 50s.
B00004XPP0|4.0|This here review only concerns the first episode. More about the others later. This first film in a long series is interesting in the vision of the world it provides. The world is dominated by a terroristic and tyrannical Empire. But the vision is centered on simple people who suffer this tyranny but who are in contact with  the force . They are thus able to go beyond the surface of things and to use the balancing forces of the universe that the Empire negates. Then this first center connects us to the rebellion against the Empire, a rebellion that is seen as a monarchy of some symbolical value, particularly a Princess. The second interest is the fight between this Davidlike rebellion and this Goliathlike Empire, and the rebellion, with its little means, but its enormous personal investment and courage, a bunch of heroes ready to die to assert and give some future to the rebellion, is thus made victorious and it can destroy the normous war-machine of the Empire : the gnat is stronger than the lion. This makes us feel that this rebellion, in spite of its monarchical aspect, is the real representative of the American ideal : to fight for justice and freedom, through personal commitment. We can think of the model that lies behind : the fight against Nazi Germany, Hitler and fascism. We could also see the model of the fight against a certain type of communism represented by the Wall or the Iron Curtain. We must also note the vision of this intergalactic world as being an assemblage of very different  people , species and subspecies, within a  market  economy where everything has a monetary value, but a wild market-economy where violence is at times the best way to  buy  something. Yet the mercantile and mercenary pilot hired by Luke and his friends becomes a hero because he saves the situation and enables Luke to destroy the warbase of the Empire at the very last second. Hence ideals are successful in the end. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.
B0000584TI|5.0|GG's first three albums had moments of brillance mixed with a number of pedestrian compositions. Octopus is the first album where the songwriting/performing comes together. This remastered edition has terrific sound (slightly warmer with a bit more depth than the US domestic version). If you're not a hardcore GG fan then I would stick with the much less expensive US version (which sounds really, really good).<br />The Japanese demonstrate their usual attention to detail with this reissue (something that their US counterparts could take lessons in from them). The artwork restores the original Roger Dean painting and is in a gatefold sleeve like the original release. Although I wish that the lyrics and credits could have been printed a bit larger in English (these eyes aren't what they used to be), I can't argue with the quality of sound and presentation.<br />One of GG's finest albums finally gets the respect that it deserves (I'd also recommend the remastered In A Glass House put out by the band themselves with live bonus tracks).

B000002KAT|5.0|I've found it near impossible, in the thirty odd years I've been listening to Astral Weeks, to convey to others just what makes this piece of work so special to me. Can I explain excactly what Van's singing about here. No. Well I know what I think it all means, but thats probably miles apart from Van's meaning. It does'nt matter because the greatest art always inspires intensely personal reflections, and this recording, aside from being aurally enjoyable, is a work of art. I bought the LP version in 1970 after first hearing Van's Moondance LP. I loved Moondance, but I was blown away, all my preconceived notions of rock music and singing and song structure were altered forever the first time I dropped the stylus on Astral Weeks. The jazz musicians hired to back Van in the studio may have been mailing their playing in as some critics have suggested (if so, put me on their mailing list), but to my ears Richard Davis' double bass playing and Connie Kay's drumming provide a subtle yet powerful propulsive undercurrent that allows Van's voice and guitar the freedom to roam and soar at will.He sings of childhood and his native Belfast and loves lost and found in an acrobatic display of scatting and alliteration, and when words fail, the music takes up the story. Hypnotic and calming, and disturbing all at once, background music for mellow folkies it ain't. Whew! Folks, it really is as good as all the reviews over the years have said. It's been a major influence on other singer songwriters although I'd be surprised if it's sold 2 million copies in all these years, and I bought half of those anyway. Of course Van went on to his well deserved cult superstardom and honors galore, but if he had never recorded another note after Astral Weeks, his place in the pantheon of popular music would still be assured. My boat's leaving for the desert island now, gotta grab Astral Weeks and go.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this CD right after its release last summer.  I'd listened to a couple of the songs here on Amazon and thought maybe I'd like one or two enough to justify buying the CD.  WRONG--I was shocked to find that I loved every song.  My fav is still MY LOVER'S GONE, which sounds ancient but at the same time, it could be those aliens again &quot;No earthly ships will bring him home....&quot;!
B000059R8Y|5.0|This record takes you a bit by surprise.  Every song has a distinctly different style.  I think your mind wants to classify it the first time you listen.  After listening again, you begin to appreciate the absolute perfection of each and every song.  The musicians are impeccable, and Clapton is at his best.  It's become one of my very favorites.  Well done Mr. Clapton.  Keep doing what you know is good.
B000056K04|1.0|If you were a big DMB fan before, you know by now that this CD more than dissapoints you. The depth of lyrics is terrible. Compare lyrics such as &quot;I did it, do you think I've gone too far?&quot; with something like &quot;Mommy, come quick, the dreaming tree has died. The air is growing thick, the fear you cannot hide. The dreaming tree has died.&quot; from Before These Crowded Streets or a song like Typical Situations from Under the Table and Dreaming or any of their pleasant ballads like #34 from UtTaD. The depth has become the mainstream teenie-bopper-pop kind. Music-wise, they have also devolved. The fact that no other DMB albums have showed up in the &quot;Customers have also bought this:&quot; list should tell you a lot.

Everything from Director/Actor commentary to story boards to scenes with and without the effects for comparrison... it's all there!  This set is worth the first DVD alone.<br />Enough about what features come with the DVD (like a couple of documentaries on the movie), and more about the movies themselves!<br />Who couldn't enjoy the laughter and the magic surrounding these two movies?  Both are great fun and laughs.  Some guys go into business catching ghosts... wouldn't we all love to do that?<br />How can I say more about an american classic?  These movies are easily some of the best movies of all time.  Any fan of the Ghostbusters should buy this DVD--trust me--it's worth every last penny.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I have never in my life seen a movie that enthralled me as much as 'Almost Famous.' By far, this is Cameron Crowe's best effort yet. This story details the life of a fifteen year old music critic at the &quot;end&quot; of the true era of &quot;rock and roll.&quot; Fantastic.
6305232660|4.0|The smartest thing about this movie is that it will endlessly be compared to Armageddon, which makes it look like one of the best movies ever made. I am not a fan of Armageddon because they made nothing more than a two hour plus MTV video, which got sillier by the moment. The makers of Deep Impact were smarter in that they actually set out to make a movie about the end of the world. They should have let it be the end, however, which would have set up far more interesting scenarios in the subsequent struggles just to survive for the remaining peoples. Instead, they copped out and gave us some compensatory damage and deaths, but I knew all along what would happen. There are great shots of the comet and attempts to destroy it and I liked the performances overall and the effects were, well, effective. But a true disaster film needs to be disastrous to work well. Poseidon Adventure was a great disaster film because most of the people on the ship died. To prove the point of a comet or asteroid impacting on the Earth, it needs to be shown in every detail, deaths and all. Someday, a film like this will be made and this one will be seen as quite secondary, or even tertiary.
6305364613|2.0|&quot;Parting is such sweet sorrow, so I say goodnight until morrow.&quot; <br />Why not just goodbye? That's what I said after my first and last viewing of Baz Luhrmann's rendition of &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,&quot; a film I anticipated eagerly, which would explain my dislike for it. The movie takes an unconventional approach to the famed work, pitting the tale of our lovers amidst a modern-day setting, while keeping the precise words from the original play. It attempts to appeal to a broad range of audiences, which explains most of this things wrong with it. <br />Our introduction to the film begins with an ugly outburst between members of two opposing families, the Capulets and the Montagues, at a gas station in Verona Beach, Miami. We're given brief introductions to the important characters, centering on the ominous Tybalt, who slings guns and matches but never inspires any sense of boldness or fear. As the story goes, we're introduced to our &quot;star-crossed lovers,&quot; Romeo, a Montague, and Juliet, a Capulet. Their relationship is immediate and rushed, amidst the brawling of their opposing families, and their ultimate decision to stay together seals their timely fates. <br />The big question weighing on everyone's mind is, &quot;Why doesn't it work?&quot; There are three answers to this question: 1) the incorporation of the play's dialogue and events into modern-day life, 2) the way in which the treatment is handled by Luhrmann, and 3) a lack of emotion generated by the supporting cast.<br />The film attempts to keep the dialogue and customs of the period within the story, and it clashes with the modern-day era in so many ludicrous ways. Romeo's friends and confidants wear saggy pants and unbuttoned shirts, all the while shouting out poetry in an almost rap-like nature. Their lines are unconvincing and border on hilarity in some serious scenes, taking away from the story of anguish and battle between the families. <br />Of course, some blame is to lay at the hands of the actors in these roles. John Leguizamo portrays Tybalt, and fails to do anything with the character. He is supposed to be feared by his foes, and cocky in his demeanor, but Leguizamo only succeeds in making a mere fool of himself by hamming it up all the way. Dash Mihok is seriously miscast as Benvolio, and would do better to stay away from serious roles such as this. And the hammiest of the hammy goes to Carlos Martín Manzo Otálora who, as Petruchio, is uninspiring, unconvincing, and just plain aggravating to watch. His trysts in drag are some of the most ridiculous machinations of the film. <br />The battle between the two families is never established, nor are the actors who portray the parents of our lovers. Brian Dennehy as Ted Montague is given nothing more to do than sit in a limo throughout most of the film debating with his wife, an equally uninvolving Christina Pickles. Lady Capulet, now Gloria, played by Diane Venora, is overly flamboyant and flat, and her performance at a costume party is the glaze on the ham. The one supporting character who is given a chance to shine is Paul Sorvino as Fulgencio Capulet, and when he lays the hand down on Juliet, his performance is powerful in spite of the rest. <br />And then there are the two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet. There is an large amount of chemistry between these two, which is intrical to the romance, and and the two of them play their parts extremely well. DiCaprio is actually convincing in his deliverance of Shakespeare's poetic words, as is Danes, who evokes sadness and a slight naivety in her role. The love scenes, most notably at the costume party and at the balcony, sold me on their romance and chemistry and, believe it or not, I felt my heart beating a little faster. It's only a shame that all of this is wasted on the surrounding execution of the plot. <br />Luhrmann's use of the story's plot amidst modern Miami is a far miss in termsof believability. Our opposing characters carry around guns like a baby carries candy, in full view of citizens and cops; Romeo is merely banished from the city for his ole in the death of Tybalt; everyone is speaking in verse and rhyme. You'll find yourself heaving a lot of &quot;no ways&quot; throughout. His combination of the verse of the play and modern times seem more like hopes of attaining a larger audience than actual art or vision. <br />There's too much hammy acting and uninspiring elements in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; to merit acclaim of any sort. The only upside resides in the romance aspect between the two young lovers, handled wonderfully by the two leads. But Luhrmann chooses to bury them under a blanket of ludicrous performances by most of the supporting cast and muddled dialogue which is totally out of place in the modern setting. &quot;By my head, here comes Baz Luhrmann's new film.&quot; &quot;By my heel, I care not.&quot;
B0000524CY|4.0|Though there weren't many scenes added to this version of the movie it is fantastic because of the remastered sound. The Dolby 5.1 digital sound is so good you really hear chilling effects from all directions. I really enjoyed this new version.
6301971582|5.0|Times change,I saw logans run at the pictures,and thought it encompassed the novel ,so what .i then saw &quot;star wars&quot; and was blew away by the imagery, etc,but now i can see that logans run was true social comment,and star wars was cinderella
B000001FY9|5.0|Arguably the best 'Greatest Hits/Best Of' package ever, LEGEND presents the American radio version of Marley, with much of his revolutionary ferver and virtually all of his religious thesis stripped away, leaving an incomplete picture of the man while delivering a ton of great music.<br />Island Records even had the brains to include the classic live version of &quot;No Woman No Cry,&quot; from the LIVE! album, instead of the studio version.  This is, for my money, the greatest of all Marley recordings, from one of the best ever live LPs.  The live version of &quot;Get Up Stand Up&quot; would have made more sense than the studio version too.<br />I like some of the lesser-known tunes here so much.  &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; and &quot;Waiting In Vain,&quot; &quot;Satisfy My Soul&quot; fill out this great, great LP with another side of the man's music, one not often heard on American radio.<br />And, of course, you get the dance-floor favorites that made Marley's fame in America--&quot;Could You Be Loved,&quot; &quot;Stir It Up&quot; and &quot;Jamming.&quot;  <br />Marley was never as big in the States as he deserved to be; he was venerated as a political, musical and even religious figure throughout much of the third world.  This album, along with LIVE!, demonstrates that the US missed the boat on the musical piece of the puzzle.
1563890119|5.0|This introduction to the greatest graphic novel of all time is just that.  An Introduction.  I got angry when i read other reviews which only give it three or four stars because it lacks the intensity of some of the other books.  I beg to differ.  24 hours is my favorite story in Sandman because it is so twisted and demented. Eternal waking is in this book, and that is one of the coolest things about the series. If you want to read Sandman, you have to start with this book. It's just that simple.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Like the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM, SANDINISTA finds a band at the height of its creativity taking on a myriad of musical genres and succeding on virtually every attempt.<br />In 1980 straight guitar-bass-drums punk was going stale, and Dub, a reggae-rap music which introduced the idea of multiple-version releases to America, seemed ready to take the lead.  Sandinista is, among other things, the Clash's big Dub LP.  Those multiple versions required more vinyl, obviously.  Strummer also took it as some kind of personal afront when Springsteen released the double-disc THE RIVER the same year, commenting that, if Springsteen released a triple-LP album, the Clash would respond with a quadruple-disc record.<br />It is the Dub stuff that I enjoy most on SANDINISTA.  &quot;Living In Fame&quot; and &quot;Silicone On Sapphire&quot; stand up to this day, something I can't say for &quot;Hitsville UK.&quot;<br />The best moment, though, is the first: &quot;The Magnificent Seven,&quot; with Strummer spitting his lyrics.  The Clash had a lot to say in 1980, and Strummer seemed to think even three discs might not hold it all.<br />There is little I would change about this album.  It is a monster, but a good one.

B00005B6C9|5.0|What a refreshing treat to have the Bee Gees come back so strong with this new album. After several interesting but somewhat forgetful albums in the last 15 years, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; certainly proves that the Bee Gees are force to be reckoned with. From the title track that has 'smash hit' written all over it to the beautiful &quot;Wedding Day&quot; that will certainly be the background for many future nuptials, the Gibb Brothers prove that they can still write and sing better than most any other act in the industry. The variations in style for each of the tracks on this album make it more like a journey through their history rather than simply listening to a bunch of new songs. &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; showcases Barry's familiar voice with a tune that is sure to make heart's flutter. Robin's voice on tracks such as &quot;Deja Vu&quot; seems to be like a fine wine--it just gets better with age. And Maurice takes lead in several spots...the chorus of &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; is one of those that is hard to get out of your head once you've listened to it a few times. It becomes obvious that the brothers were not only creating wonderful songs, they were having fun while doing so. And if you get to see the video to the title track, you will immediately realize their sense of humor and ability to ground themselves. <br />All in all, the Bee Gees have done great work here. We are already hearing that the &quot;Bee Gees are back&quot; when in truth they never left. North American radio has been stubborn to play their songs the last 20 years, despite the continued hits in Europe and successes for other artists. But the latest project will certainly make a great impact here in the States, as it is already doing overseas.
B000002ADT|5.0|Just to add my two cents to the penny jar, I have to say that _Kind of Blue_ is one of the best works in any genre of music in the twentieth century.  The reason?  When you have several of the finest in jazz (Adderley, Philly Joe Jones, Red Garland, and of course Coltrane, Davis, and Evans) at their very best form working around a new modal concept that has infinite soul . . .  how can any Stravinsky, McCartney, or Ellington top such an achievement?  Truly one of a kind.
B000002J0B|5.0|This is as simple as it gets i dub thee the best cd ever i have heard there others but man does houses of the holy kick as*.  i bought this cd a couple of weeks ago and usually my other cd's get tireing and i move on but hell man this is awsome i'm still listening to it today.  if i was you i would get up and buy this right now it Rocks.  the music on this cd makes you want to flow with it you get right into this cd.
0792839730|4.0|Having visited Belgium and Holland quite a bit I really appreciated the location shooting.  It is something not done with very many (or maybe none that come to mind) WWII movies.  I am moving to Antwerp this summer and can't wait to go to the Arnhem area with my 16 yr old son to see first hand what sacrafices were made over 50 years ago.  I have read the Ryan book and to the best of my recollection this movie is very historically accurate.  A very nice change from the studio made movies.
6304779607|1.0|The first 10 minutes of this movie present a pretty entertaining introduction to the title character, Marion &quot;the Cobra&quot; Cobretti.  The reflecto sunglasses, the laser scoped gun, the cobra insignia on the gun's handle, the match dangling from his pouty lips (I thought that went out in the 50's?).  After those first 10 minutes, however, I had a hard time maintaining my concentration on this movie.  <br />In 1985, Stallone and Schwarzenegger went mano a mano with two war superhero movies, &quot;Rambo&quot; and &quot;Commando,&quot; two of my all time favorites for that genre.  In 1986, I was hyped for the round two with &quot;Cobra&quot; and &quot;Raw Deal&quot; fighting it out for the detective superhero award.  Well, both movies rank among my all time least favorites for ol' Hanz and Franz.  How can a woman as good looking as Brigette Nielsen be such a bore playing a model?  And why does Stallone play the Cobra like Rocky Balboa with a speech impediment?  (I know that is redundant).  I guess he thinks the shy-guy routine will somehow allow this 2 dimensional character to cast an actual shadow.  We'll never know.  You'll be best off skipping this one at the rental outlet.
B000003TAW|4.0|its sad that this amazingly wonderfull band got labeled a one hit wonder,seeing as how every song they do is chock full of home cooked catchyness.&quot;my name is jonas&quot; is the second best track here,next to &quot;say it aint so&quot;.but youll find that the wholesome goodness doesent stop there.song after song,youll be saying &quot;how in the name of popcorn on sunday does this guy write such great songs that are so mind numbingly simple?!!?!??&quot;. noone knows.if they hadent had that one bloody hit, they would have been regarded as the next buzzcocks or ramones.oh well,thems the breaks when you deal with stupid mainstreem morons.
0780622650|5.0|My review of this movie is simple. Buy it. When I invite friends over that don't know about dvd and home theatre, I put this movie in and blow them away. The action is sharp. The special effects are simply in the highest eschelon of movie effects. The story is well done and driven. I like action. I like sci-fi. If you like those two genres... you must simply buy this movie on DVD. It's that simple.
B000002BYD|4.0|this was the album that got me into them.&quot;do the evolution&quot; should have been a huge hit, but im glad it wasent.&quot;brain of j&quot; kicks things off and cuts into &quot;faithfull&quot;, than &quot;no way&quot; and onto a song with so much emotion not only in the vocals, but the music as well, &quot;given to fly&quot;.this might sound sappy, but i think that song is about trying to find your place in the world, on your own terms.anyway,an underrated gem form an overrated band.
0440219078|5.0|What a touching book. It shows the ultamite value of the human spirit, even in the face of danger. This book is the most touching book i have ever read, and may it's message live in the hearts of all.
B0000028UK|4.0|this album is what they should have been doing all along.&quot;blood&quot;,&quot;go&quot;, &quot;animal&quot; and the heart wrenching &quot;rearview mirror&quot; come out of nowhere to shock this formerly PJ hater.if this had been their debut, i doubt they would have sold as many records as &quot;ten&quot;, but thats it.whereas they deserved to be labeled &quot;fakes&quot; and &quot;sellouts&quot; with &quot;ten&quot;, they deserve just as much to be credited with praise for this great record.
B00005B6C9|3.0|I'm as big a fan as anyone but don't believe these inflated, 5-star reviews. I think our boys really need an outside producer to help shape their material and vocals. For a trio so known for their soaring harmonies, there are only a couple of tracks that show them off. Someone needs to tell Barry that his breathy vocal style is just too precious. Just sing the song! You know how! And there's a certain lack of warmth to most of the album, too much techno production and drum machines. On<br />the positive side, it's a big improvement over the mediocre Still Waters and this one gets through seven straight listenable and enjoyable tracks before running into a truly terrible one (Maurice's WALKING ON AIR). Again, don't believe the rave 5-star reviews. If you are like me and think their material has been hit-and-miss since their ONE cd came out, then this one won't surprise you
B000002AZ8|4.0|every song, even stupid mop!, flow into one another.no one style dictates the feel of the album ,just feeling.i could name the best tracks,but i doubt anyone would disagree.allthough they have never made one true masterpiece,this comes close.
B000002J1B|5.0|Yes continued to ride upon their surging undulation of progressive ambition with Relayer, the most experimental of the band's disparate catalogue. As a fan who enjoyed the subtle beauty of Tales From Topographic Oceans, I initially found Relayer's abstruse music opaque and puzzling, in a sense that I couldn't 'get' the songs. After awhile, though, things began to click, and I now find Relayer to be one of the most interesting of all progressive rock albums.<br />The dictionary definition of &quot;Music&quot; is this: &quot;The art of arranging sounds in time so as to produce a continuous, unified composition, as through melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.&quot;<br />The side long track here is the phenomenal &quot;The Gates of Delirium,&quot; which is perhaps progressive rock's most evocative composition. It goes beyond the above definition of music in a sense that it - for the most part - forsakes melody to generate vivid images and tell a (generalized) story. Innovative in its use of instruments, the song summons forth images of battle: the cacophony of clashing steel, cries of distress, the razing of buildings, et cetera. The percussive assault of Alan White's drums is astonishing, serving as the fundament for the dense tapestry of sounds that invokes the lucid image of war. It's quite amazing; close your eyes and let yourself become inundated in the intricate weaves of instrumental violence. When the dissonance comes to an end, a quiet, ethereal passage concludes the song. Here, Jon Anderson's delicate vocals soar with an ineffable heavenly quality that gives me shivers. Many know this last part because it was made into a single-edit, but believe me, it loses its punch when not preceded by the lengthy span of chaos.<br />The weird &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; follows. Here, new keyboardist Patrick Moraz's jazz influence is very evident, and Squire's adroit bass and White's meticulous drumming tear through the mix. This song, too, often trifles with dissonance, but with a different effect. This song is peppy and almost fun, and the vocals are catchy and almost evoke Yes Album melodies. Howe's solo is dangerously close to jarring with that grating pitch, but otherwise this is a neat song.<br />The album finishes with the soothing piece &quot;To Be Over,&quot; a quiet aria that can lull me to sleep. Not because the song is boring, not at all. The vocal melodies are radiant, and the arrangements engaging. But the song is so peaceful and gives me a profound sense of mental solace. This song makes me feel like I'm floating...ahhh...<br />Since Relayer is something of an acquired taste, I think it takes at least five listens to understand the music. Then it probably takes at least a dozen listens to begin appreciating the depth of each composition. It's an involved piece of work, but well worth the effort to make it &quot;stick.&quot;with a different effect.

B000002BFL|5.0|i am hard-pressed to express my admiration for this album, one of the most affecting things ive ever experienced. suffice to say, i actually get chills by the end of highway 29: &quot;i told myself it was all something in her, but as we drove i knew it was something in me.&quot; if you are debating buying this cd, please do so, and see how devastating simple words and chord changes can be. the ghost of tom joad comes of a staggering literary tradition (steinbeck, o'connor, carver) and i truly believe it can stand with any of it.
B00004XQP4|2.0|everybody is writing about warning like its good or something. no. no.no. no. these are the posers that just got into greenday after their mainstream splash from dookie. i guarantee that none of these people have either of the greenday cds from lookout! records. that was the prime of greenday but now their fame has gone to their heads. that is to say that this was just a poor attempt to cash in on the money. ok done ranting. all in all warning wasnt that bad, but only if you are one of those that listen to pop music. that is what warning is. pop music. any who love greenday will be disappointed because this is not greenday. a few songs are worth listening to and there are some have funny little commentarys but i cant recommend this cd for anyone who has any sense of individuality. all you pop loving girls are like fish swimming in the sea trying to fit in. and this album should go with you cause us real music fans are weeping at the path that greenday (and other bands too for that matter) have chosen to take. i have a theory though, from all the negative feedback that greenday gets from this pile, maybe theyll go back to the way they were, back when they were loved... ahh. a dream really, but you never know.

B000005IS1|5.0|Rock and roll extremism has known few more exuberant avatars than the MC5. Enough make the case for their fellow Motor City mental cases, the Stooges (most famously the late Lester Bangs, whose review of their second - and best - album, &quot;Fun House,&quot; which he called &quot;Of Pop and Pies and Fun: A Program For Mass Liberation in the Form of a Stooges Review, or: Who's The Fool,&quot; articulates it with the most spirited elan), as at least the MC5's equal, but you're talking about two distinctive breeds of the same existential organism: not until Nirvana would rock come anywhere close to taking Iggy's teenage wasteland panache to where you looked like a dope if you merely wrote it off as inane droning.<br />The MC5, on the other hand, could outplay the Stooges at the drop of an amplifier tube. They sounded as though they knew more of the Velvet Underground than just their ex-viola/bass player twiddling the studio dials (Velvet legend John Cale produced the first Stooges album, whose signature cut - &quot;I Want To Be Your Dog&quot; - was nothing if not an answer song to the Velvets' pounding &quot;I'm Waiting For The Man&quot;). And, they succeeded, in ways the self-righteous folkies, the wearily pretentious psychedelics, and even the detached Velvets could not, in standing delusions of grandeur (in their case, Movement or Movement-answering rock and roll politicking) flatly on their heads. They might have bought into John Sinclair's half-baked leftism to only such extent as it granted succor to a kind of libertarian ethic and aesthetic, but the MC5 were too exuberantly randy, in sound and in substance, to survive very long as New Left or any kind of political windup dolls. Which is precisely the point behind &quot;Kick Out The Jams&quot;. You could call it subversive, of course, as many enough did. But if you accept the prospect that enough of a part of them bought into the political chazerei the better to find a hole through which to drive a white-hot rock and roll branding iron, &quot;Kick Out The Jams&quot; is very subversive, indeed. Never mind high energy; these guys were striking for ionospheric energy and for the most part getting it, not to mention waving the psychedelics' snooty faux individualism AND the Revolushyong crowd's self-congratulation right back into their own faces with slash after slash of feedback and brittle distorted chord after riff after chord. <br />The whelping good time of the title track actually cracked the top 100 as a single in 1968 and sent its title into the rock lexicon, and the MC5 deserved that if nothing else. (They also deserved to have a chart crack on the album's leadoff track, &quot;Ramblin' Rose,&quot; the most insane rewrite of Bo Diddley's &quot;Road Runner&quot; you'll ever have in captivity.) They didn't deserve an awful lot of what they inadvertently inspired, unless you think that flat-as-a-pancake Cro-Magnon preening and junior-high-schoolish &quot;brothers and sisters&quot; rappery of Grand Funk Railroad was hatched completely out of their manager/producer's smarmy brain. But then the MC5's disciples also included the New York Dolls and Patti Smith (whose &quot;Radio Ethiopia,&quot; including and especially its title track, owed most of its primal shudder to the MC5's amphetamine subspace demolition of Sun Ra's &quot;Starship&quot;). The MC5 lived long enough to crank out two further albums of kinetic apesh@t drive, the oddly compacted &quot;Back In The U.S.A.&quot; and the Stones-meet-the-Godfathers R and B lacings of &quot;High Time,&quot; but it's &quot;Kick Out The Jams&quot; which secures their reputation to this day, mostly because it makes the latter two albums sound like the Partridge Family playing the  Pretty Things.
B00005B1W5|5.0|Tribute goes beyond &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot; not only in regard to the musical pieces, but for the visual and audio quality.  The &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot; DVD is a horrible transfer - the original laser disc was much better.  Tribute, on the other hand, is clean as a DVD can get - a gorgeous picture... and the sound is stunning.  The musical pieces themselves are excellent.  Particularly amazing are: Deliverance, Tribute, Waltz in 7/8 and Dance With a Stranger.  Additional videography (not of Yanni and the actual concert) is also gorgeous.  Footage of the Taj and the Forbidden city is nothing short of breathtaking.  Get this DVD ASAP and put &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot; back on the shelf and forget about it.
B0000024UO|4.0|How impressive was Johnny Winter just before he cut this album, his Columbia debut? Columbia's then-president, Clive Davis, shelled out a then-record.... bonus to sign the gangling albino with the slick fingers and the hotrod blues. Small wonder Imperial Records couldn't wait to get the set Winter and his then-rhythm section (future Double Trouble bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Uncle John Turner) had just finished laying down, the remarkable &quot;Progressive Blues Experiment,&quot; out onto the racks at about the same time.<br />Winter opened up the industry's eyes in the first place when friend and fan Mike Bloomfield urged him onstage at the Fillmore East during a SuperSession show with Al Kooper; Winter played for about fifteen minutes and flattened the place cold. His Columbia debut gives you ample enough reason why, but it was way far more than just the randiest bloozeguitar jerkoff of the year - this guy was going deeper than the average string strangler. <br />He doesn't even have a guitar in his hands, for example, when he delivers a very soulful cover of Ray Charles's &quot;I'll Drown In My Own Tears,&quot; and he's one Texan who had the Chicago blues esthetic down cold, the evidence here being &quot;Mean Mistreater,&quot; which features two titans of the Chicago style, bassist Willie Dixon and harmonica virtuoso (when he kept himself straight, anyway) Big Walter Horton. And when he switches to acoustic resonator guitar for his own &quot;Dallas,&quot; a skippy-whippy piece which pays a debt to Texas legend Blind Lemon Jefferson, Winter's just as much in his element as when he's rat-racing the electric fretboard. Likewise with his cover of Robert Johnson's &quot;When You Got A Good Friend,&quot; his guitar playing simpler but deeper, and his vocal at once reverent and soulful. <br />Yet when he does rat-race it, he's not just spraying fast and loose with no direction home. Those arpeggiated runs and machine-gun licks are so tightly controlled some accused Winter of scripting himself only too cleverly by half. Not so, though you might well understand why a lot of people didn't quite know what hit them when hearing &quot;I'm Yours and I'm Hers&quot; and &quot;Be Careful With A Fool,&quot; the former his own composition, the latter a once-obscured B.B. King number. Winter was no Johnny-come-lately, and not just because he'd slogged the Southwest blues bars for almost half his young life to this point, either. He proved it on his next Columbia issue, in spades...

B00000IL67|5.0|Where do I start, I have once again fallen in love with the man called Alice. This box set is such a gift, a thousand thank-you's, Brian!!! Please extend to your boss my deepest gratitude and admiration for what he has done for rock and roll over the past 30 plus years. Where would rock 'n' roll be today without Alice? Probably no more. I could go on and on with details about the box set, and that would take too long. But anyone who has any affection for rock music would do themselves a tremendous favor by aquiring it. Suffice to say this; anyone who has any doubts of Alice's talent, depth, range, or gifts in musical (not to mention theatrical!) ventures, or of his ability to do it for 30+ years, should listen to &quot;I Never Cry&quot; followed by &quot;Freedom&quot;. Everything in between is also some of the best rock music ever produced. Plus Alice has to be the nicest guy to strike fear into the hearts of parents in history. Truly an American legend, there will never be another one like him. I'll never forget the 'Coop!
B0000062GK|5.0|I just borrowed this album from a friend, and lemme tell ya, it rocks!!!  I've never heard someone who could play better or arrange guitar parts than Joe Satriani.  He's probably the best guitar players out there.  I used to think that Eddie Van Halen's the best, until I heard this!  Also, Joe taught Kirk Hammett (one of my favorites) and Steve Vai, which is pretty cool.  My favorite songs on here are 1, 3, 4, and 7.  To all guitar players: buy this.  You'll be inspired.
B000008H1R|5.0|Ah, the nice raw sound of early Jethro Tull.  While it's not as good as Aqualung and doesn't provide any real 'hits' (except for maybe To Cry You A Song), this album has tons of good cuts.  It's got a lot of stuff you'll find on the masterpiece Aqualung: rocking electric guitar parts, beautiful keyboard and acoustic guitar passages, the flute, and Ian Anderson's well-thought lyrics.  I can't name any favorite songs, I like them all quite a bit.  If you like things like Aqualung and Thick As A Brick, there's no doubt you'll like this also.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Most people consider Aqualung Jethro Tull's best album ever.  I have most of Tull's records, and I must say, it's really tough to deside.  But I will say that this is definately one of the best, if not THE best.  It's got lots of good classic songs, such as the title track, Cross-Eyed Mary, My God, and Locomotive Breath.  Ian Anderson is so awesome, he's one of the best musicians ever and his lyrics are intelligent and really make you think.  It helps if you can relate to his thoughts (one of the reasons I like Tull alot).  On this album he questions organized religion, something that I too have many doubts in.  While my parents go to church on Sunday I crank up Aqualung!  If you enjoy classic rock, metal, hell, any kind of rock, this one's for you.
B0000024W3|4.0|Self Portrait is one of the most eclectic and unusual albums in the Bob Dylan catalog.  Originally released as a double album in 1970, the album contains originals, covers, live recordings and versions of his own songs made famous by others.  The album doesn't contain any real definitive songs, but the album's premise shows that Bob Dylan is his own man and doesn't bow to any pressures around him.  At the time, people where clamoring for Mr. Dylan to re-establish himself as the voice of his generation and comment on the political unrest of the times.  Mr. Dylan just followed his own muse and the results are unspectacular, but pleasant.  His covers versions of &quot;The Boxer&quot;, &quot;Early Mornin' Rain&quot; and &quot;Blue Moon&quot; are worth repeated listens as his version of his own &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot;.  &quot;All The Tired Horses&quot; and &quot;Days Of '49&quot; are great songs.  Self Portrait is an essential Bob Dylan album, but it is definitely one of his most interesting.
B00000K0T8|5.0|Classic, essential, original, trendsetting, I won't say groundbreaking because nobody seems to be smart enough to copy this album.  Ghostface is my favorite rapper.  So original and out there, but his lyrics still make sense.  I was trying to choose what lyrics to show, but I couldn't make up my mind.  His lyrics are amazing.  Either he's telling crime stories like Raekwon, or just putting crazy imagery in your head.  And his topics are so original.  Failed robberies, revenge, some girl he likes, and of course that he's the best rapper out there. There is also a genuinely touching song dedicated to his mom. Also there is the most woman hating song I've ever heard, and it's not just your run of the mill woman hating song.  He put work into his lyrics, and his delivery is crazy.  The beats of course, are great.  Here are some lyrics to some other songs.  Read them out loud.<br />&quot;90 minute Maxell tapes, instrumental breaks/ Bangin earaches, lay my verse down in two takes/ The speaker pops, the Winchester rifle's in the kitchen/ Murder the DJ's eyes twitchin, woofer hissin&quot;<br />&quot;The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon/ blonde head's inscriptions with three sixes in/ Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosives/ I slapbox with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph/ Zoomin like binoculars, the rap blacksmith/ Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless/ I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy/ True identity hidden inside secret tabloids.&quot;<br /> Then just wait till you hear it with his voice and delivery.  I was gonna go on and on about this album, but I don't want to write that long a review. Get it.
B000002552|5.0|After his motorcycle accident in 1967, Bob Dylan secluded himself in his Woodstock, NY home.  During this time, he recorded over 100 songs with his backing group, The Band, in the house's basement studio.  These songs surfaced over the years in various bootlegs, including what many people consider the first bootleg album called The Great White Hope.  Finally in 1975, Mr. Dylan &amp; The Band released this double album.  While it only scratches the surface of these sessions (many of the songs don't even include Mr. Dylan), it is an impressive document of one of the most important and famous recording sessions of all time.  Songs like &quot;Tears Of Rage&quot; and &quot;This Wheel's On Fire&quot; would surface on Band albums, but the original versions here are more powerful and potent.  The album is simple, yet sprawling and is worth buying for its historical relevance alone in addition containing great music.
B00000IAU3|3.0|This cd contains catchy little tunes and I find her voice very hypnotic and relaxing.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|I fully admit that much of my passion for this movie lies in the fact that it is one of my earliest filmgoing memories. It is vitrually impossible for me to remove this film from my childhood perceptions of my parents. In fact they looked suspiciously similar and the end of the 1960's and early 1970's to Sundance and Etta. My folks fancied themsleves as such in terms of not only their dress but in their attitudes and values as well. This is not to suggest they were outlaws (maybe in the eyes of the Nixon administration they were) but rather folks passionate about an older time that never truly existed.<br />That personal testimonial aside, I love the film on its own merits as well. It isn't a work of art to be sure, but it is a fine example fo the Hollywood system creating new myths based upon real legends. <br />The performances of Redford and Newman are so seemless that it is easy to blur the lines between acting and being a movie star. It may be fashionable to knock their work in this picture as Hollywood confection, but I dare any other actors of the time to pull off these performances. Their use of silenc and evaluation are even far more effective that their already dead on line delivery- the mark of fine acting craftsman. The fact that I as an audience member immediately accept and believe wholehearedly their circumstances and become lost in their story is a testiment to their ultimate artistry.<br />Conrad Hall's photography is both breathtaking and heartbreaking. He truly creates a romantic look at a time and place that could only exist in the imagination. The DVD transfer really makes his painting with light shine and sing. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the few films I would absolutely love to step into out of real life.<br />Director George Roy Hill knows exactly how to economically stage a scene while remaining invisible. He varies the storie's pace effectively between tension, whimsy and gentle tragedy. His humor is remarkably subtle and sophisticated without the slightest hin of condescention- a hallmark of a good director.<br />William Goldman's script does not simply rely on clever one-liners as so many imitators have in creating similar scripts. It is actually poignant in its simplicity and humor. The scene where Butch and Sundance, although both mortally wounded, still find the courage to dream about a future is really what fine writing and peforming is all about.<br />Butch Cassidy and the The Sundance Kid is a classic film in the sense that it never fails to entertain and touch the heart. It remains as fresh today as when it first appeared.  Some may find it rather saccarine and manipulitive now in this age of cynicism and media hype. I don't and since being a film fan is based so much on raw emotional response to a visual story, this is one of my favorite films.<br />The DVD edition is not only great to look at, it's many extra features and interviews are a joy and privilage to watch. Hill and Hall's commentary, although often redundant, is also a good listen.<br /> This is well worth its rabid cult following as it appears so effortless in its ultimately entertaining journey.
6304712936|5.0|Amadeus is one of those movies that touches your heart in a way that many movies don't.....through music, and the music of Mozart is one of the most perfect types of music to touch people.  Although this movie is not entirely based on fact and uses quite a bit of dramatic license, two things emerge every time I watch it 1) how great a composer Mozart was and 2) how jealousy and feelings of inadequacy can haunt us all.<br />The movie is told through the eyes of a court composer, Antonio Salieri.  Salieri was one of the great composers of the time, although he has since been all but forgotten.  In comparison to the music of Mozart, Salieri feels vulnerable and inferior.  As a pious man, he had earnestly prayed to God to be blessed with the ability to compose music that would not only be remembered throughout all time and eternity but that would also praise the glory of God.  Salieri feels slighted by God when he comes in contact with Mozart, who is portrayed as a childish, immature, and somewhat vulgar person.  His jealousy begins when he hears the beautiful music that Mozart is able to create.  This causes the beginning of his downfall---turning away from God and doing what he can to ruin Mozart.<br />Throughout the entire movie, the audience is introduced with snippets of Mozart's music that are perfectly chosen for each scene.  One truly gets the feeling of just how great a composer Mozart was.  Also, the script (and an incredible performance by F. Murray Abrahm) make the audience sympathize and empathize with Antonio Salieri.  He personifies all of our weaknesses, our feelings of inadequacy and inferiority, and our jealousies of other's strengths.<br />Amadeus is truly one of the great movies of all time.  It won tons of awards which stands as a credit not only to its greatness, but the greatness of the music of Mozart and as a testament to feelings that are just as present in today's times.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks is the foremost 'Queen of Rock and Roll' - there is no doubt of that. Janis Joplin, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, and Debbie Harry did not have prolific and long careers as Ms Nicks who continues to weave magic upon her loyal fans. <br />After the somewhat disappointing and lacklustre 'Street Angel' - Stevie has returned to the form that will make fans rejoice. In fact, looking and sounding awesome - she is better than ever.  Some songs are new, some old, and other renditions of previously released material. <br />The central core that bounds this album is the acoustic guitar with a generated pace that is slower than past efforts. 'Sorcerer' formerly released on the 'Streets of Fire' soundtrack and sung by sometime back-up vocalist, Marilyn Martin, - has the rock edge taken off it and becomes a duet with Sheryl Crow. Their musical partnership coming in second to that of Lindsey Buckingham.<br />  While there are so many good tracks on this release, 'Fall From Grace' is the bombshell, for which, you should prepare yourself to be blown away. It is reminiscent of Stevie's live performance of 'No Spoken Word' from the Red Rocks concert video. <br />'Its Only love' has that Buckingham Nicks album feel and again re-iterates the prominence of the acoustic guitar. Its simply stunning and makes you crave the official CD release of that album. Other goodies are 'Planets of the Universe', 'Everyday', and the country-ish 'Too Far From Texas' which so suits Stevie's style. You'll find yourself swaying to that one.  <br />Buy this CD and play it loud all Summer long.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks new album &quot;Trouble in Shangri-la&quot; is so good its almost too good. I can't explain how exciting it is to hear new stuff from the rocker herself. Don't let all the guests fool you, this is a STEVIE album. And probably her best. Sheryl Crow could have not done a better job. I'm going to have her produce my record next time around. Whenever that time comes....
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman is an excellent example of a movie which came along at the perfect time.  America in December 1978 was a country consumed with self-doubt: Watergate, lingering wounds from the Vietnam War, and Economic Stagnation were all on the national consciousness (just as the Great Depression, and a Europe sliding into war were on the minds of most Americans when the original Superman comic debuted in 1938).  The cinema of the 1970s reflected this: All the President's Men and The China Syndrome reinforced the impression that America's best days were behind her.<br /><br />Superman was the antithesis to all of that self-doubt, and was the cornerstone of what Christopher Reeve called the \\"New Patriotism.\\"  Riding on the heels of the success of Star Wars, Superman was a feel good movie with fine plotting, groundbreaking special effects, and wonderful acting from all involved - especially the young unknown actor who would don the cape and bring new dimensions to an old role.<br /><br />The movie has held up very well over the years.  True, hairstyles and car models look dated from a 21st Century viewpoint.  But a great film rides or falls on the script, and that has not dated at all.  The classic themes are all here: greed (Lex Luthor's nuclear land-grab scheme), rebellion against parents (Superman defying Jor-El and interfering with human history), and good old fashioned romance.  The acting is also on a much higher level than one would expect in a film of this type, particularly from Reeve, who clearly delineates the roles of Clark Kent/Superman - for once the difference is more than just a pair of glasses.  (Watch the scene where Clark, at Lois Lane's apartment considers telling her of his other identity.  When Reeve takes off Clark's glasses and Superman's PRESENCE fills the room, that's the best special effect in the film - and it's all in Reeve's acting.)<br /><br />The visuals have held up well over the years, and look even better now that Superman's costume is consistently BLUE during his flybys.  (It occasionally turned green during the original theatrical run and initial video releases.)  A few of the miniature work near the end looks blatantly fake, just as it did in 1978.  But for the most part, the film is as dazzling as ever - especially the Krypton sequences.  John William's stirring score remains some of the best work submitted for film by that or any film composer.<br /><br />Richard Donner is known as a director with an eclectic visual style, and that suits the various moods of this film well.  From the epic Kryptonian opening, to the rural Smallville setting, through the snappy Metropolis sequence, the director adapts his style to the script's demands - and keeps the audience entertained.<br /><br />Donner was in charge of the transfer of this film to DVD, so this is his vision of Superman, without the interference of the Salkind family, who cut corners and lowered the quality of the remaining three films.  Those familiar with the theatrical and various video incarnations will be in for a surprise.  Numerous scenes not included in the theatrical release are reinstated here.  However, there is not the extreme padding of scenes as was done on the broadcast television versions put together by the Salkinds.  All the new footage enhances the movie and emphasizes the plot and the characters.  The optical elements have been scrubbed and the film has never looked better.  There are only a few moments when the film stock shows its age.<br /><br />The new sound mix will be more controversial.  Many of the sound effects have been replaced and/or recreated.  This is most noticeable during the opening credits and Krypton sequences.  According to Donner, post-production on the original film was very rushed and he was never satisfied with the original mix.  But, that's the way the film has been heard for over twenty years, and longtime fans with strong memories of the film may find this mix disconcerting.  As for myself, I like the new mix, but wish an alternative soundtrack with the original mix had been included as well.<br /><br />The extras on the 2-sided DVD are a joy to behold.  The three part documentary hosted by Marc McLure (Jimmy Olsen) sheds new light on the disorganized and hectic production of the film - with a great deal of unseen footage.  The screen tests of Christopher Reeve and the various candidates for Lois Lane (including Stockard Channing, Anne Archer, and of course Margot Kidder) prove that Lynn Stallmaster did an excellent job casting the film.  Trailers and other supplemental material are also included.<br /><br />One complaint: Warners should do away with their \\"snapper\\" cases and use the \\"clamshell\\" style case most other studios offer.<br /><br />Nevertheless, no fan will want to be without this timeless classic, refurbished and preserved for new generations of young people - and the young at heart - to marvel at.<br /><br />Blu-ray update, July 2010: This film is available on Blu-ray.  I purchased a copy and can definitively say that I prefer the standard DVD version.  It's not that the image quality on the Blu-ray is lacking, quite the opposite.  The high definition reveals every flaw in the original visual effects, particularly the explosion of the planet Krypton, which was obviously filmed in front of a wrinkled backdrop.  This was not visible in theatres during the original run, nor on VHS or LD.  It was barely detectable on DVD (if you pumped up the contrast on your monitor), but it is glaringly obvious on Blu-ray, as are flaws in the flying sequences.  I'm not usually fazed by imperfect VFX, but these took me out of the story.  There are no additional features here, either.

6301963717|5.0|And since  *Fargo*  was the best American movie in the 90's, I guess  *Miller's Crossing*  comes in number 2.  Followed by  *Barton Fink* . . . you get the idea.<br />It's always puzzling to me that the Coen brothers are so disdained within the critical community.  Is it because they sense that Joel and Ethan are essentially ridiculing the entire medium?  Oh don't get me wrong; they obviously love movies, and they make them better than anyone, but how is a film critic supposed to take the scene where Albert Finney goes ballistic with a never-ending stream of withering pellets on a pair of gangsters in his own bedroom?  Critics know the Cohens are lampooning  &quot;sacred&quot;  film moments such as when Sonny Corleone gets obliterated at the toll-booth  (to say nothing of Warren and Faye getting theirs back in  '67).  They know it, and they dislike it.  We're told that they're too  &quot;cold&quot;, they're  &quot;pretentious&quot;, they're  &quot;mocking&quot;, they're ultimately not serious moviemakers.  These are doubtless the same critics who used similar terminology in regards to Stanley Kubrick, but now that he's safely passed on, they can call him a  &quot;genius&quot;.  Well, in any event, the Coens are better than Kubrick ever was  (ok, *Lolita*  was great), anyway.  As for comparisons with  *Goodfellas* -- there IS none.  *Miller's Crossing*  accomplishes more in 2 hours than Scorsese's bloated movie does in 3.  The Coens are surgeons.  No scene is wasted  (statements about  &quot;stylistic tangents&quot;  to the contrary).<br />This movie's a masterpiece, dude.  Has Jon Polito ever been better?  For that matter, has Gabriel Byrne ever been better?  (Was Jeff Bridges ever funny AT ALL until  *Lebowski*?  Et cetera.)  Obviously, actors need masterful scripts.  All too often, they don't get them.  The Coens write masterful scripts.  Watch  *Miller's Crossing*  and let the character development astound you.  The theme of personal honor is rigorously pursued throughout, and the intricate plot is gravy.  The Coens are the best American filmmakers since Orson Welles, and any film  &quot;critic&quot;  who says otherwise is just giving you the high hat.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Although this album came out one year prior to my birth, it is an album that remains apart of my growing up, just as much as Romper Room was.  &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; is a song that my father used to play for me as a child, and if I ever have a daughter, it will be played for her too!<br />Songs like &quot;Knocks Me Off My Feet, &quot;Summer Soft&quot;, &quot;As&quot;, &quot;If It's Magic&quot;, and all the rest of the jewels of music on this CD are timeless classics. There is a song for everyone and everything on this CD; there's classical music- &quot;Village Ghetto Land&quot;; gospel-&quot;Have a Talk With God&quot;; (almost)jazz- &quot;Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call); EVEN latin and Zulu tongues- &quot;Ngiculela- Es Una Historia (I Am Singing).  All bases covered!<br />This CD is a classic, and a must have for music lovers!!!
B0000508U6|5.0|Subtle, textured, melodic, ambient are all words that come to mind after listening to &quot;Parachutes&quot;. The lyrics are simple, no semantic gimmicks, just bare bones honest emotion. This one gets better every time you listen to it. As for the Radiohead/U2 comparisons etc, it's kind of a joke. I think critics just can't categorize Coldplay and lump them in with other UK &quot;indie&quot; bands. Buy this album!
B00005JG6U|1.0|warning amazon costumer!!  do not buy this dvd. it is an edited, r-rated version of the original film, which is one of the gratest movies of 2000. the original cut features frequent drug use and a really creepy sex scene that freaked the mpaa out! if you are easily offended, you shouldn't be buying this movie anyway. if you liked the movie, or you didn't watch it but are in search of something totally new and original, buy the unrated version.  this one is not good.
630521610X|4.0|A crazed horror film buff wearing a &quot;Father Death&quot; costume is making mincemeat out of the locals in the sleepy little town of Woodsboro.  Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) discovers that the killer is getting closer to her as the one year anniversary of her mother's murder approaches.  A coincidence?  Lots of scares, laughs, suspense, in-jokes for horror film buffs, red herrings, and a few cameos (Linda Blair, Henry Winkler, and Wes Craven) as well as memorable characters.  Probably the most complete and satisfying horror film trilogy ever; writer Kevin Williamson wrote drafts for the two sequels at the same time!
B0000029DD|5.0|What?  You don't own this yet?  This should have been one of the more influential rock albums of the 90's, but it was left unrecognized for 3 years until his tragic death.  Son of a cult rock legend, Tim Buckley, Jeff crafts music that makes your soul scream from the inside.  His music is filled with the power and passion.  I can't even name songs I feel are great because the album is solid throughout, but highlights for me always end up being Last Goodbye, Hallelujah, Love, you Should've Come Over, and Eternal Life.  If you are looking to a compliment to this album check out his &quot;Live at the Sin E&quot; CD.
6305903182|3.0|Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is in hiding following the killings in &quot;Scream 2&quot; when the production of &quot;Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro&quot; begins production and yet another killer comes out of the woodwork.  Sidney finally comes out of hiding when the killer finds her and rejoins Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courteney Cox) in trying to find the killer as he is taking victims in the order in which they die in the movie.  Like it's predecessors, there are slashes and scares and laughs, as well as a few cameos.  Fun for fans of the series but it's obvious that this has run it's course.  DVD has theatrical trailers, commentary from director Craven, a music video, outtakes from all three films, deleted scenes, and an alternate ending.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This bands spirit reaching music most likely falls into the noise rock genre.  The ambiance, created nearly entirely with real instruments, is the closest thing to acoustic trance there is.  In fact, I could see electronica fans loving this as long as they can accept the lack of a groove, and a less overt beat.  This music most reminds me of The Autumns music.  The musical noise makes me feel as though we are in the oceans of space with waves of music power flowing in and out of the shores.  I was introduced to this bye Nick Harcourt of Morning Becomes Eclectic on KCRW in LA, and this is such a great choice for me.  Definitely check out the Autumns too, but you will also like this if you like Radiohead's new release (Kid A), Godspeed You Black Emperor, or ambient rock.  There may even be a Brian Eno influence here, definitely worth checking out.  Cutting edge, innovative rock.
1558908498|4.0|Two years after the murder spree in &quot;Scream&quot;, survivors Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are in a midwestern college when &quot;Stab&quot; is released - a movie about the killings in the first film.  This sets in motion a copycat killer who sets his sights on Sidney.  Back on hand are obnoxious tabloid reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) and former police officer Dewey Riley (David Arquette) who wants to protect Sidney.  Film pokes fun at itself - &quot;Sequels suck&quot; says one character.  But what's really a pleasant surprise is that while this is essentially a repeat of the first film, it's nonetheless a well crafted thriller that keeps you guessing.
B000001E18|5.0|An often overlooked album here in the United States, where it is quite possible to find 100 copies of Joshua Tree to only 1 copy of this album. It did however win grammy of the year for Best Alternative Album which suggested to me that the Grammy's were making up for not giving Achtung Baby the Album of the Year award.<br />There are certainly a few throwaway tracks on here The Wanderer, Some Days are Better than Others, but other than that this album ranks as one of U2's finest. This album houses my all-time favorite guilty pleasure U2 song, Babyface. A song in which Bono sings about a pretty little girl who just happens to be a porno star. <br />The definite high points of this album come in three great and memorable songs. Stay (Faraway So Close), a song that shows Bono can rank with some of rocks greatest poets. Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car, a song that starts out as if the czar of Russia has just ordered your death but in actuality it's the sound of a father's temper. Dirty Day, a song in which the music builds and ends in a sing out loud chorus.<br />Let's also not forget about songs like Lemon, Numb, and Zooropa. Three great songs that both center around the eerie, and genius that is U2.

B00005B6C9|5.0|I am not a Bee Gees fan but this album is amazing! From the cover (graphic art wizadry) to production.<br />Every song on here is a potential hit.  The production is first rate, the lyrics and hooks are pop music at its best.<br />Forget those boy bands of today and get the original who show they can still play and compete with the kids.<br />Standout songs are &quot;Wedding Day&quot;, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;, &quot;Embrace&quot;.....the whole album is strong.<br />A definite buy.  Finally I get my dollars worth on a CD.  Thanks Bee Gees for embracing the music buying public with a pure treat.
0517201658|5.0|The first time I encountered &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, was when I was perhaps seven years old in the kitchen of my house listening to the din of the TV in the den.  I remember my mother talking about what a great movie it was and how beautiful the music was.  One  summer about eight years later,  I was fortunate enough to have seen the first part of the mini series.  However, I was going away for the summer and couldn't see the rest.  But I was curious.  Lucky for me the place I went to had the book sitting on a shelf.  The book for me became one of the  best, if not thee best, work of literature I had ever read.  The story, I feel is a very important work of literature to teach about human actions and consequences.  In another sense, the book is a very important achievement in Australian literature and should be considered in every World Masterpieces class on the high school and college level. I cannot recommend the book enough.  I did get to see the rest of the movie eventually.  I was, however, disappointed, not at the acting, but at some of the casting and as well as some of the story line rewritten to fit into the mini series.  The movies focus was mainly on the love story between Ralph and Meggie, although this was a very important part of the book, it was not the only part.  My opinion is read the book, then see the movie. If you don't you are doing yourself a great injustice.  Richard Chamberlin, Rachel Ward, Jean Simmons, Richard Kieley and Barabra Stanwyck - wonderful!
B00004SVIK|5.0|Wow! I've been a Pink Floyd fan for many years and have listened to a few bootlegged shows of Pink Floyd, but NOTHING can compare to Is There Anybody Out There: The Wall Live.  This is a CD which can be listened to without pause; every song is necessary in order to understand the story behind The Wall. Roger Waters' magical lyrics shine in each song and Dave Gilmour's blazing guitar work has never been better. Listening to the solos in Comfortably Numb and Mother made me feel like I was watching Gilmour playing a-top the wall.  If you've never heard of Pink Floyd, purchase this album.  If you're already a Floyd fan, purchase this album. I highly reccomend the limited edition box set - it comes with a hardcover booklet with pictures and commentary from Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason. A must in any music collection.
B00003CXRP|4.0|The ending is what life is - unpredictable. The character found gratitude, something that most people don't have. Tom Hanks is a fine actor. The movie was good, it's as simple as that.
B000024D4R|5.0|When listening to Animals, one sees society through 3 different types of people: Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep. These are meant to represent different classes in society, and Roger Waters' lyrics portray this in a musical masterpiece. Aside from the genious lyrical content, the CD is filled with Gilmour's atmospheric guitar work (in songs like Dogs, and Pigs: Three Different Ones) which keeps the listener buzzing with anticipation of the next riff. If you've never listened to Pink Floyd, this is THE CD to get. From the gentle strumming of Pigs On The Wing to the fast-paced rythm of Sheep, this CD will definetly get you thinking, as well asusing your CD player more often.
B00000099Y|5.0|All right, 5 stars, yadda yadda yadda, greatest band of all time, I know you've read all that drivel.  This album is so hard to describe, because it stands on its own.  Not many bands do that nowadays.  Precise, driving, profound.  In 10 years, people will be saying the same thing...Wow.  I want some of what these guys are having.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie has it all. Plain and simple. It's action packed, with mind-boggling special effects, it will satisfy any action fan's appetite. Yet, it has one of the smartest plots I have ever seen in a movie, I feel that it is incredibly under rated. It single-handidly brought Keauno Reeves back from the dead, quite an accomplishment ;-). There isn't a single wasted scene, the movie moves at a breakneck pace and still has great character development. The characters react believably, something that isn't seen all that often anymore. The line that Cipher utters:  &quot;I know that this steak isn't real. I know that when i put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my mind that it is delicious and juicy. And after 9 years, you know what i've found out?&quot; he takes a bite, &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot;  perfecly illustrates how many people would act, when faced with the choice between one or the other (im trying not to give anything away here), they would choose the Martix.  You have to watch this movie at least twice, the first time through I found myself trying to get a good grasp on the concepts the movie introduces, but after seeing it upwards of 15 times, its as good as it ever was. Very Highly Recommended.
0783228317|4.0|Starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro, this film version of Hunter Thompson's 1971 novel is an exaggerated personal oddesy into the excesses of the drug culture.  The story is meaningless as is the plot, just a couple of guys with a lot of drugs and a lot of cash who spend a frenzied weekend in Las Vegas.<br />One of the successes of this movie, which decidedly is not for everyone, is that it manages to get into the head of the drug takers who just keep going and going and going.  They are true &quot;garbage heads&quot;, which means they take everything and anything in any and all combinations.  There's lots of LSD, cocaine, uppers, downers, poppers, grass, and a seemingly unlimited supply of pharmaceuticals.  They take these drugs constantly, in every scene, and special visual effects recreate their internal trips.  It's hilariously funny and also disgusting, especially the vomit scenes which I'm especially sensitive to.<br />The writterly skill of Hunter Thompson is shows through in occasional voice-overs and newsreel clips of the time, putting the whole piece in context and actually re-creating a special time and place in American history.  I liked it but it's probably a little too weird for most people.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|I've got to agree with the other review I see here - it's about time.  (What drove me to post this, though, is a bit of an error in said review - Akira ain't the main character, that's Tetsuo.)<br />It's a complex story, if you take it in on all levels - but it's a well-written, superbly-animated classic.  Lots of action, lots of violence, decent voice acting in either English or Japanese, all wrapt around a gripping story.  If you want a sneak peak, find it on VHS, but I can assure you the DVD will be worth it.  :)
B00003CXPC|4.0|What happens when a boy from a working class coal mining district wants to study ballet?  This is the plot of this feel-good British film which has won several awards.  It has a statement to make about gender stereotypes and family love and it makes its point loud and clear.<br />There's some fine acting in this film.  The 14-year old Jamie Bell, cast as Billy, is an excellent actor as well as a good dancer.  I immediately related to his struggle to sneak away from boxing class and study ballet in spite of the disapproval of his father and brother, striking miners who are going through struggles themselves, especially since Billy's mother has recently died.  Julie Walters plays the ballet teacher who believes in Billy, Gary Lewis plays his father, and Jean Heywood is his elderly grandmother who tends to wander away and needs to be taken care of.  Billy's young gay friend is played by Stuart Wells.  Billy is not gay and this entire subject is handled with a high degree of sensitivity.<br />Some of the British dialog was lost on me and as I was familiar with the plot there were no surprises.  But the tension was kept up throughout with constant obstacles being put in Billy's way.  Even after he has won his father over to his side, he still has the tough examination by the Royal Ballet Academy to contend with and the audience has to sweat this out right along with Billy. I would have liked to see a bit more dancing.  What we do see is excellent but they are all solos performed without costumes.  I wish there was at least one full ensemble piece.<br />I enjoyed this video although something holds me back from raving about it. Maybe because it was almost too good to be true and everything turns out for the best.  However I definitely do recommend it for everybody.  It will leave you with a nice warm pleasant feeling.
0451457994|5.0|I guess I won't say too much because the consensus is that it is a great book.  I was utterly confused by the movie so I bought this book and suddenly things became clearer.  The three sub-stories threaded so well together and the amount of detail is staggering, but not overwhelming.  I never considered myself a science-fiction fan, but Clarke and Kubrick hit the nail on this subject and it was just fun to read this book.
B000059ZT4|5.0|This Deluxe Edition is worth every cent, but perhaps the Jamaican version should also be released on its own merits at a regular CD price. The remastering sounds great on both CD's and everyone will have their favourite comparison to draw between the Jamaican studio mixes and the Wailers-approved overdubbed mixes cooked up in London by Chris Blackwell. You could start by checking out the unadorned vitality and brilliance of &quot;Stop That Train&quot;. The two Kingston tracks cut from the 'western' version are of the highest quality. The first, &quot;High Tide Or Low Tide&quot;, is a beautiful tribute to the mainstream black music I assume they could listen to on their radios. The second, &quot;All Day All Night&quot;, slides in there nicely between Midnight Ravers and Slave Driver in the original Jamaican running order. Bob Marley and his closest friends were setting out on a mission to spread the word, and maybe make some money. Blackwell needed to do what he did to reach his rock audience back then, but now, with the benefit of familiarity, we can appreciate the pure Wailers sound crafted in Kingston. Buy a copy right now and hear the world's other great protest singer and his pals setting out to conquer the world.
0767817478|1.0|This Has to be the only movie I ever saw that when I was in the Theater the only thing I could think of was damn when the hell is this movie going to finish.  This Movie just Plain Sucks! Trust me dont waste your money.
B00003CXAY|5.0|A powerful yet beautiful film. Although, there is no dialogue in the film (just music and pictures), its message is very clear. The many facets of this film shows the many good things about life on earth that went wrong through stunning visuals and an eloquent yet haunting soundtrack by Phillip Glass.<br />It may be already out on video but not yet released on DVD. I would highly recommend this one to anyone!
0812589041|5.0|Enders Game is a pure thrill ride. There is action in every corner. Ender Wigin is a super genius that has got the fate of the whole world in his hands. The 'buggers' have attached the world twice and almost wiped out the human race. Now the government chose Ender to be the high commander to halt the buggers in the next invasion.

Ender has the smarts and the passion to win but the only thing holding him back is his sadistic brother Peter who keeps coming up in the games he plays at battle school. If Ender can get past his fears he might be able to save the entire planet, as well as his beloved sister Valentine who he has always loved. Without the help of the teachers and having few friends he learns to be the best out there. But is he good enough? You will have to see for yourself.
B00004Z459|5.0|I thought that this CD was just plain excellent.  It has all sorts of great things that I can't name them all.  I don't care if some people say that Linkin' Park and this CD will be nothing in a few months/years or whatever they want to say, I will still be listening to them.  I recommend this CD to any music fan as it is a great addition to your library.  This is one of the few CD's that I can say I hardly skip over tracks.  My recommended tracks to listen to are:  #2 One Step Closer #4 Points of authority and #8 In the End.
B000059Z8J|5.0|When I bought my DVD player 5 years ago there were only 2 movies that I wanted to own.  Star Wars and Superman.  Well, I got one down.  This DVD is truly something special.  I had heard rumors that there were extra scenes never seen before and that those scenes would be on the DVD.  But I thought to my self, &quot;would they be inserted into the film or simply pushed off onto a side menu&quot; (ala Austin Powers).  I was delighted to see the answer was both.  The movie is presented in its spectacular, original form.  Deleted scenes added in.  The quality of the transfer is breath taking.  And John Williams score comes through in beautiful digital clarity.  The movie flows so much nicer with the added scenes.  Another treat are the 3 &quot;making of...&quot; documentaries.  Ever wondered how they made Christopher Reeve fly almost 15 years ago.  The secret is at long last revealed.  However, I think the best part of the DVD is the interview with Christopher Reeve.  He truly is a &quot;SUPERMAN&quot;.  Enjoy!
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger changed my worldview (Weltschauen?) by changing me. <br />If you'd care to analyze Mersault with me for a second, you'll notice that one of his main characteristics is that he doesn't care what other people think of him. His thoughts and actions are not dictated by the reactions it may elicit from those around him. Also, he is completely honest with himself and doesn't delude himself into thinking that he feels emotions which are actually not forthcoming. For example he doesn't either mourn or pretend to mourn at his mother's funeral. It may make other people think of him as a cold, uncaring person, but as far as he's concerned, at least in my opinion, she died when they stopped seeing each other. <br />What Mersault does care about is experiencing the simple pleasures in life, and, in the process, fulfills whatever mundane obligations are necessary to for him to survive in either a civilized bourgeouis society or a jail. In other words, if you let him live life as he sees fit, he won't cause any trouble and will even help you when he feels it is necessary to do so. When unavoidable constraints are placed upon him, such as not being able to smoke in jail, he acclimates himself to the constraints and goes on experiencing whatever simple pleasures are possible in a jail cell. However, if cause him trouble for no reason or try to convert him to your way of living or thinking, he'll defend himself and take the offensive when the opportunity arises. Mersault does what he wants. If you deliberately try to get in his way, watch out.<br />What I'm trying to say here is that Mersault was as free as any human could possibly be. He viewed the world something he could enjoy living in no matter what conditions he was living under. If other people didn't like him for it, so what. Life was made to be enjoyed, not worried or mourned over.<br />So, in conclusion, I guess it changed my world view by giving me a philosophy of how to live my life in it.
B00005ATQM|5.0|wow, where to begin on this new DVD audio thing!!! For starters this new DVD, totally will make it seem, as though the TallicA guys are in your room playing there music..Vocals from one speaker(usually front) and back up vocals(from back speakers) drums usually from one set of speakers, bass the way it should sound all from a subwoofer...I must say the delays on this DVD are well worth the wait...I can definetly say, that if you give this DVD a spin in your DVD palyer, and have a nice system, you will definetly hear the clarity of the music...I highly recomend the purchase of this DVD by the TallicA guys...
0805211063|4.0|&quot;The Castle&quot; is a typical work of Kafka.  It features an enterprising, stubborn, white-collar protagonist facing insurmountable obstacles who lacks the introspection to see he is a playing a game he cannot win.<br />&quot;The Castle&quot; is about Joseph K., a Land Surveyor, who comes to the village under a reign of... well, not terror, perhaps bumbling indifference, by the imposing symbol of absurd beauracracy, The Castle.  The Castle assigns inept assistants to Joseph, does not allow him to contact them, and worse yet, does not even give him a job, but tells him to &quot;Keep up the good work.&quot;<br />Along the way, Joseph makes the acquaintance of a mysteriously shunned family, takes on a fiancee who may or may not be all that she appears, and encounters a menagerie of cryptic, esoteric characters -- all of whom have their own ideas about the Castle and its vague, shadowy inhabitants.<br />This is a pretty effective treatise on beauracracy and the frustration of the common person of working hard and getting ahead.  But be forewarned:  the ending is imminently unsatisfied. Also be certain to try and find a Max Brod translation if possible.  The difference is very notable.
B00003CXQX|5.0|The Emperor's New Groove is like a Bugs Bunny and friends cartoon but is missing Bugs Bunny &amp; Friends. David Spade is the voice of a young full of himself emperor named Kuzco.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|People at my college in London are going on about all these different bands making strong headway in this, the UK's \\"Year of Rock\\" (according to the 2001 music press). Bands such as Papa Roach, Linkin Park and (shudder) the abysmal Limp Bizkit, have seen an immense increase in popularity and recognition among alternative and mainstream groups. But no one seems to mention At the drive-in, who in my opinion, with Relationship of Command, have created one of the most viscerally powerful and exciting rock albums in the last 10 years. I'm not joking about when I say this is exciting music. The first time I heard \\"sleepwalk capsules\\", a song that showcases Cedric Bixler's dynamic vocal talents, I nearly fell off my chair! It was the only song I needed to hear before I realised I was listening to something extra special. I bought the album almost straight after that and have not looked back since. The lyrics and musicman ship of this album are quite brilliant, it's one of those albums which you can listen to again and again and still find something new and amazing every time. All of the songs are exhilarating, punchy rock, not one track can be described as a filler, but the standout songs are:<br />Arcarsenal: Brilliant, brilliant opener. Fast paced, great bass playing and those trademark Cedric Bixler vocals. The lyrics are quite astounding as well.<br />One armed Scissor: AMAZING guitars. The hookiest song on the album, yet for some reason it still took me months to find the melody in the chorus (the power of the guitar in this song at high volumes makes it hard to define for the uninitiated)<br />Sleepwalk capsules: If you began to chill out once you thought One armed scissor had ended, prepare to have your ears bombarded with the most brilliant opening 20 seconds of punk rock ever recorded. You really have to hear it to believe it. Turn your stereo UP for full effect.<br />Rolodex Propoganda: This song contains one of the best lyrics relating to censorship in modern society I have ever heard. The song structure and vocal matching between Iggy Pop and Cedric Bixler is very instinctive and raw, and adds to the power of the music. It also has the most original guitar hook I have ever heard (Omar, you are in my debt).<br />So all in all, this is a great, great album, that has to be bought by anyone who is interested in Punk Rock/Emo-core. Trust me, people will be talking about this one in a few years...
0805062971|5.0|This book really made look at things a lot differently.  Especially after watching the movie then reading the book.  It helped me understand what Ed Norton was going through and the other ways of how to make napalm which were not mentioned in the movie.  It changes your outlook on life and you view things in a different perspective.  I've watched Fight Club at least seven times, and after you really understand what happens, it scares you.  I sometimes feel the way Ed Norton does throughout the movie.  Watch the movie first, then read the book.  THEY ARE THE MOST INCREDIBLE PIECES OF ART EVER CREATED.
0060194995|5.0|The place is Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's. The book is told through the eyes of Scout Finch, an eight- year old girl. At first you get to read about things as they are \\"today\\", and then the book actually begins by leading us in to the three-year journey  through the life of Scout, her brother Jem and her father Atticus that led to how things are \\"today\\".  Atticus Finch is a trial lawyer representing Tom Robinson, a young black man accused of raping a white woman. This is the very central thing about this book: Atticus is white and he represents a black man, which is a very controversial thing to do in Maycomb at that time. Robinson is found guilty and he is sentenced to life, al though it is clear to everyone he is innocent. It is this case that presents the ugly, racist side of Maycomb. The things concerning the case happen mostly in the second part of the book. In the first part Lee concentrates on telling about Scout's  and Jem's  relations with the towns other people. Hear you find many unpleasant people and Atticus is forced to explain a lot of things to Scout and Jem about why people act the way they do sometimes. But all in all I would say that Scout and Jem were very happy, because they had a loving and wise father and although their mother had died when they were very little they had a black cook, Calpurnia, who was kind of a mother figure for them, a part of the family.  This book is very good in many ways. I love Atticus as a character because he holds such wisdom and because he really is a man who stands by his principals through the whole book. I noted these words by Atticus because I think they say it all: 'You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.'  I think it was very clever of Lee to tell things through the eyes of a child: You read about a child's thoughts and feelings but at the same time there is a very mature side to the text. <br />Another goodthing about the book is that although the first half of the book was sometimes quite \\"slow\\" the end was so good that I must say this book is worth reading again. It is truly an unforgettable novel about fatherhood, honesty and justice.
B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack moved me at many emotional levels. The way Hans Zimmer plays with your emotions and the music is absolutely stunning. I have not heard such music in a long while and I just wanted to dive into the music and play it as loud as I could. It has been a lot of fun to listen to everywhere I go, Work, home and especially in the car.. I highly recommend the 3rd track as an inspirational piece!
B00005ASOC|1.0|The biggest problem with this movie is that it begins with strong momentum, bringing your critical defenses down.  Then you are accepting and start to like it a little.  Finally, towards the end of the film, you feel foolish, completely taken advantage of, because you realize that it is pure garbage from the start.  When will Hollywood stop propagating racial stereotypes?
B000002AHM|5.0|What happens when you bring together two great improv jazz guitarists and an incredible flamenco player? The answer is this album: an acoustical tour de force of flamenco and Latin flavored jazz tunes. Three great guitarists, each in their own right, come together to provide a little over forty minutes of mind blowing music. <br />John McLaughlin and Al DiMeola are improvisational giants with a great understanding of the music that they are playing and seem to be able to play new ideas with simple ease, always surprising to the listener. Paco de Lucia had never strayed from the proper form of flamenco music before joining his compatriots on this album. Night after night of trying to play the notes that reflected his feelings, instead of the same way each time, left Lucia with headaches after each show. The improvisational skills Lucia learned from these two masters would help him change flamenco to reach a wider audience. <br />The album opens with \\"Mediterranean Sundance/Rio Ancho\\", a powerful duet between DeLucia and DiMeola that explores lightning fast runs and a flamenco style rhythms. This is the showcase tune of the album, which turns out to be more of a cutting contest of seeing who can play their phrase the fastest. Nevertheless, this is still a fun piece to listen to. DiMeola and McLaughlin team up for a cover of Chick Corea's \\"Short Tales of the Black Forest\\". \\"Frevo Rasgado\\" finds McLaughlin and DeLucia trading phrases at blinding speed. This was the piece that piqued my interested in this album. Very flamenco sounding. All three get together to play the remaining two songs. \\"Fantasia Suite\\" is simply amazing. There isn't a dud on this album.<br />Normally, I will purchase a live album over a studio because the performers play at a higher energy level. Although this is true with Friday Night in San Francisco, there are parts where the audience is too loud and drowns out the musicians. Hearing adults \\"shushing\\" is annoying, and reminds me of being in school. <br />If you like great guitar playing, especially with a flamenco sound, definitely purchase this album. Your jaw will drop and your head spin trying to comprehend how fast these three virtuosos play.
B000002U8G|5.0|First, I must say that this was the first Pink Floyd album I ever owned.  Not a second has gone by that I am thankful for my purchasing decision.  Pink Floyd is definitely the best psychadelic band of all time and one of the leading commercial bands, due largely to the success of their later releases &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Wall.&quot;  Each song touches something.  Each David Gilmour guitar riff and Roger Waters lyric just gives you that gut melting feeling that only a handful of bands can provide (including The Beatles, John Lennon's solo work, Led Zeppelin, and Queen).  The first cut, &quot;One of These Days,&quot; provides a great taste of basslines mixed with steady percussion and guitar riffs.  Although no vocals appear on the first track (any descernible ones, anyway), it still is a very good song.  &quot;A Pillow of Winds,&quot; the subsequent track, is one of the most relaxing songs ever made.  The constant guitar melody and difficult toplay basslines combine to form a drowsy, relaxing, and beautiful song that reall ynever gets old.  The next song, &quot;Fearless&quot; never let's you down.  It is also very dreamy like &quot;A Pillow of Winds&quot; but is more fast paced and consistently rock &amp; roll with excellent melody and guitar work.  &quot;San Tropez,&quot; perhaps one of the best cuts on the album, has a jazzier sound.  It is the type of song that you'd hear in some futuristic, sci-fi jazz bar(as wierd as that sounds, it still pretty much describes the song).  &quot;Seamus&quot; is probably Floyds most country sounding song ever recorded( as difficult as that is to imagine).  A nice, slow beat and more acoustic sounding guitar work make this song a Pink Floyd classic (not to mention the perpetual synth. made dog sounds).  &quot;Echoes,&quot; the twenty three minute opus begins with a creepy submarine sonar sound and never ceases to not conform to what you think will happen next.  It still fits though.  By fit, I mean it still ahs that gut melting feeling as previously described).<br />To be concise, this is a great, underrated Pink Floyd album which features some of their most unique and best songs.  If you've heard Floyd in the past and enjoyed their different style, then you will enjoy this album.
B0000024SD|1.0|[This is a reaction of a very traditional folk musician to Dylan's first electric album, which was somehow mislaid for years. I'm an anthropologist: THESE ARE NOT MY OPINIONS!]<br /><br />Can you imagine my shock when, getting Dylan's newest LP, I slipped it onto the turntable and set down to prepare myself. Dylan's LP from last year, [[ASIN:B0009MAP9A The Times They Are a-Changin']], was a rather intense album, full of protest and venom, and so I was preparing this album to be just as radical as that was. And do you know what I heard???<br /><br />Electric guitar.<br /><br />Terrible, I know. Dylan, who might have been the next Woody Guthrie, has turned his back on the people that made him big. His skill's phenomenal, and while the first album, BOB DYLAN, is a nice little folk record, it's the latter efforts that are consistently stunning. [[ASIN:B00026WU64 Freewheelin Bob Dylan (Reis)]] has so many anthems it makes your head twirl, and \\"The Times THey Are A-Changin'\\" is an album full of protest at this world. That's what Dylan does best - protest songs. He squanders his talents when he invests them in this pop drivel. \\"[[ASIN:B005F9TQAQ Another Side of Bob Dylan]]\\" , although tremendous in its own way, should have been taken as a warning. Here we find Dylan moving away from the protest songs that our generation so needs. While, as folk music, it does have its qualities, Dylan is abandoning his strengths when people need him the most. Yet, sadly, nothing else equals in talent or conviction of writing. That illustrates what a shame Dylan has become. But while \\"Another Side\\" does have the already cited faults, it stands as a worthy addition to Dylan's catalogue.<br /><br />Now we have this ramble-shack of an album. After finally making it through the first three songs, I had to take a break because of the whole shock. Yes, I must confess, for this review I did listen to the entire album. The first side's that damned electric rock. Dylan's become the epitome of the crossover. He's a traitor. The two worst compositions are the opening track and a song called \\"Maggie's Farm\\". \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" starts this album off, and as soon as you hear that you know this album has serious problems. Its fast-spoken lyrics that go by in a blur, leaving you in a daze. This type of material (fast beat, fast lyric recitation) will never become a significant part of this culture, or if it does it shows the deterioration that we have allowed instead of standing up to the problems, just like Dylan himself urged us just two albums ago. The rest of Side 1 is just more of this drivel, but the most troubling is \\"Maggie's Farm\\". Here, he essentially argues for the demolition of the music that he once stood for. He essentially states he won't sing folk. Instead, he'll become a turncoat. This is a grievous blow to our side, for, regardless of what this album may indicate, he does have tremendous talent. For those of you who liked his absurd sense of humour, evidenced on \\"Freewheelin'\\" and \\"Another Side\\", there is one track called \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\", which is funny, but beware because it still has that electric guitar.<br /><br />Side 2, opening with \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", just keeps the pace of this abysmal album. Side 2 is acoustic music, but don't get your hopes up. This is not the Dylan that we hoped. This is Dylan doing what the \\"high culture\\" deems as poetry. He basically uses random imagery strung together for senseless effects. \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", although bad, cannot equal the absurdity of the following Dylan composition called \\"Gates of Eden\\". To quote some portions of the song (please don't cringe to bad), I will show you what I mean.<br /><br />\\"The motorcycle black madonna -- Two-wheeled gypsy queen -- And her silver-studded phantom cause -- The gray flannel dwarf to scream -- As he weeps to wicked birds of prey -- Who pick up on his bread crumb sins -- And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden\\".<br /><br />Remember, these terrible lyrics are coming from the same man who wrote this:<br /><br />\\"Come gather 'round people -- Wherever you roam -- And admit that the waters -- Around you have grown -- And accept it that soon -- You'll be drenched to the bone. -- If your time to Is worth savin' -- Then you better start swimmin' -- Or you'll sink like a stone -- For the times they are a-changin'.\\"<br /><br />As you can tell, the later is obviously superiour. We have clear cut meaning, well within the confines of traditional folk. \\"It's Alright Ma, (I'm Only Bleeding)\\" shows promise of us getting the old Dylan back, but then these hopes are crushed with \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\". Some may interpret that it just means he got this out of his system, but I fear that is not the case.<br /><br />We should have realised what was happening when \\"Another Side of Bob Dylan\\" was released. Dylan deliberately abused his talent, and while \\"Another Side\\" in and of itself is not as troubling, it has planted the seed. I urge you all to not buy this LP. Tell your friends to stay as far away from it as possible. If there is enough of a public reaction, Dylan will come to his senses and become the good little folky he's supposed to be. He has so much talent he must not abuse it like he has done on this. Its just a misstep (a terrible one, granted), and the results are this mess of an album. With enough of a public reaction, his next album will be a gentle folk album. He daren't cross us again so defiantly. You know what to do. If he doesn't straighten up this LP will be the end of his career. Let's pray and hope he comes back into the fold.
B000005RTG|5.0|Take the ultimate guitarist,and drop him in the melting pot of a funked up purple, and voila= The greatest rock album ever, with possibly the exception of TEASER &amp; PRIVATE EYES.  Biased towards Tommy Bolin???  you bet.<br />This album must be played again and again-those who knock it only played it once.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This album shows the ever present creative genius of the mystical high priestess of rock and roll. Trouble in Shangri La is a lush mix of sweet love songs, hard driving rockers, and even a country ballad. This is a cd for anyone who likes good rock and roll because it has a little something for everybody. I have to admit I was a bit nervous about this album after 1994's less than impressive release, &quot;Street Angel&quot;, but after listening to just the first song I knew Trouble... was a gem. It shows Stevie's voice in top form as well as her unparalleled ability in songwriting. The lyrics are torn straight from the pages of her journals, which she has again shared with her fans. My only small complaint is that there surely was room for a few more fast paced songs.But hey, nothing is perfect. From the heart felt &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; to the tech rocking &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; this album is sure to be a winner. This is by far her best work since &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. Good Going Stevie!
B000001GPX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber's incredible mid '70s recording of Beethoven's Fifth and Seventh Symphonies is, in my opinion, the greatest recording of ANY symphonies that are currently available. Everything about the performances is perfect, from the articulation to the emotion. Nothing is spared, no shortcuts are taken, and thus Kleiber has produced the best versions of Beethoven's two most popular(and exciting) symphonies for the listener's pure enjoyment. I cannot add anything that hasn't already been said about this recording, so I'll just strongly recommend this to anybody looking to start a classical collection(anybody who already has even the smallest classical collection probably already has this album in it). Most incredible performance.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|Yeah, a little play on &quot;What Happened to You?&quot;, the ska punk song from &quot;Smash&quot;. What happened to them? Something went wrong, this is clearly not the Offspring from &quot;Ignition&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot;. It's not as poppish as many people make it out to be. I'm a huge Offspring fan, and I'll catch some flak for saying this, but the album is okay. Not hard punk, it's more punk with a little pop thrown in. SOme of the songs are actually punk, but lemme review the songs.<br />1. Welcome-not a song, and a pathetic welcome at that. &quot;Disclaimer&quot; from Ixnay was better.<br />2. Have You Ever-a nice song that kicks, then slows down at the end, good lyrics. Sorta like &quot;Come Out Swinging&quot; from &quot;Conspiracy of One&quot;. 9/10<br />3. Staring at the Sun-a continuation of &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, a really fast song. Overall good, but the lyrics need some work. 8/10<br />4. Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)-the song that launched them into stardom. Again, I'll get grilled for saying this, but the song isn't that bad. It's about wannabes, but the music is pure pop. Put some punk music into that, it would probably be an awesome song. And get rid of the Mexican girls saying &quot;Give it to me, baby&quot;. There you go. 5/10<br />5. The Kids Aren't Alright-the best song on the CD by far. It's the true Offspring, about how kids these days are all messed up. Awesome guitar riff. 10/10<br />6. Feelings-a really shallow song. Fast punk, but it just doesn't feel right. 6/10<br />7.She's Got Issues-a pop song, really, but it's a pretty good song. About a girl who has issues, simply. 8/10<br />8. Walla Walla-this song is really bad. Why sing about a prison? It's also got bad music and bad lyrics. 3/10<br />9. The End of the Line-I like this song. Fast, good guitar line, and lyrics are good. 8/10<br />10. No Brakes-good song, but a very forgettable song. 7/20<br />11. Why Don't You Get a Job?-easily the worst song on here, it's even more more annoying than &quot;Pretty Fly&quot;, and that's hard to do. Pure pop, and this song should be skipped, unless you listen to what MTV tells you to. 1/10<br />12. Americana-interesting. Beginning is slow, and someone whining in background. Then it kicks, and the songs about the suburbs and what the ideal living environment is. I really think the &quot;Well **** you&quot; bit is really stupid, it does not fit in the song. Besides that, not too bad. Similar to &quot;Bad Habit&quot;. 7/10<br />13. Pay The Man-this song is really good. Although it's 8 minutes (2 minutes for a parody on &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; at the end), it's a good song. The first 4-5 minutes are like a musical section, but its good, is pure Middle Eastern music, which is redemption for all the pop garbage on the CD. Then it kicks, and theres a lyrical section for about 3-4 minutes. THe lyrics do not make much sense, but I like the song. Great guitar, and I like the &quot;Shut up, you talk too much&quot; part. Second best song to &quot;The Kids Aren't Alright&quot;. 10/10<br />This CD is a mixed bag. Another point. I hate the artwork on the CD cover. It is stupid, and the drawings are absolutely stupid and horrible. Worse than Ixnay, which has skeletons dargging off people and women shooting each other. That's why I try to hide the CD cases. Anyways, if you're a diehard Offspring fan, get it and see for yourself. My advice: get it, but do not listen to the pop songs at all (except for &quot;She's Got Issues&quot;).

B000059TPN|4.0|As previous reviewers have said, but always left out. The Rock is about a General played by actor (Ed Harris) who's fed up with the United States congress not allowing soldiers who've died in battle have propper funds for their families and burial when their bodies could not be recovered during and after the wars. He takes his team of rogue Marines to a Military Installation, steals a dozen or so VX poison gas rockets, but not before losing a man. He then, captures a tourism class that is viewing Alkatraz Prison, also known as the Rock. Once the U.S are informed of this, they recruit Special Agent Stanley Goodspeed played by actor (Nicholas Cage) whom is expecting a child with his girlfriend. In order to enter the Rock, they need an expert. Enter John Mason played by actor (Sean Connery) who happens to be an ex-British SAS operative who's stole microfilm from FBI Dir. Hoover in the Sixties. Recruiting Mason &amp; Goodspeed, they lead the U.S Navy Seals into the Rock, and the Commander of the SEAL team led by actor (Michael Biehn) confront the marines, but are ambushed and slaughtered but not before giving a fight! Then, Mason &amp; Goodspeed must out think, out smart, the marines and defuse the guidence system chips to de-activate the VX rockets. At the end confrontation is the best, aside from the intense non-stop action!! Buy this movie, for the action. It's worth it!!!
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie took me back to the late seventies, when I was a teenager just like the main character.  There was not a false note in any of the characters or the performances.  Cameron Crowe wrote a love letter to my peers and I fell in love.
0553278223|3.0|I admit, I like Sci-Fi.  I am in the 10th grade and I chose this book a list to do a project on.  So The Martian Chronicles looked good.  My assignment was to read it and make up a project about it.  Anyway, I start reading, and after being terribly confused after the first couple chapters, I realize this book is a bunch of short stories loosely (I mean, VERY LOOSELY) linked together.  And all of these stories have one point, to comment on societies' flaws.  Well, now I have a paper to write for my assignment, and this book made me think more than any other I have ever read (except Catcher In the Rye).  The problems with this book is that it rambles sometimes and stories aren't well linked together.  A lot of times, they are just trying to find an excuse to put in some of Bradbury's short stories.  Overall, the message is good, it makes you think, but the execution is not so great.<br />And if you want a classic Sci-Fi tale, you should get a novel by Robert A. Heinlein.
B00003CXRM|5.0|If I had only has this film during my World Lit class my freshman year of college I might have enjoyed the Oddessey more.  I've seen O Brother four times already, and I can't wait for the DVD.  I was recently introduced to Cohen films by a good friend who knows just about everything about film.  He slips the Cohens into our movie nights--- I haven't been disappointed yet.  The Cohens have crafted a film that is both entertaining and cognitive- I laugh until I cry yet I am made to think- two things you don't often get in the same movie.  To say that this film is boring translates into the ideas that there is nothing intruiging about human nature, that life deserves no more than a sigh, and that there is nothing funny about existence and the paths that we take.  Human nature is and always will be something to be pondered and something to be smiled at.  The Cohens have given us another chance to do that.  It's dangerous ground to mess with a classic, but they have pulled it off beautifully with a tale that I think even Homer himself would approve of.
B00004T37H|5.0|After watching this movie again. (And again, and again...) I decided to raise my rating of it. It's a amazing movie. But I still can't get my mind of the fact, that some of the plot is very reminiscent of 'Valley Of The Wind'. If you watch it, you'll see why. But it doesn't matter. While they don't use all the computor animation Disney uses, he (The artist. Can't remember his name.) managed to make the art work breathtaking. (Well, not really.) And this movie would have a 'R' rating if not for the lack of cursing. So pay attention to the rating parents. Not all *Ahem* 'Cartoons' are for kids. In fact, most anime is geared to a more adult audience. In some cases, ONLY for adults. But not in this case.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I love this album. It's so ultra heavy, and I know that I'm really alternative because I listen to it. The lyrics are great, the guitar parts are so hard to play, and my God the vocals! Fred Durst is an absolute genius.<br />A modern masterpiece. Great stuff.<br />Almost as great as sarcasm.
1572702125|5.0|One problem with audiobooks is the dialogue. Very often an author does not supply the &quot;he said/she said&quot; before or after each quotation and the listener is often at a loss as to who is speaking. David Suchet, the ultimate Poirot, gets around this by using a different voice for each character. He had accomplished this in his reading of the complete &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; for Audio Partners and he does it again with a superlative &lt;Murder on the Orient Express&gt; for that same label.<br />  This set was designed for a release to coincide with the CBS dramatization of the classic whodunit, but Audio Partners need not have bothered. That telecast was an utter disaster with a lusterless Poirot, a cast that for the most part could scarcely create a character, and an updating of the decor (among other ludicrous changes) to the present. So the older film with its starry cast can rest unchallenged; but the public is entitled to enjoy the original and this audiobook is just the ticket.<br />  Christie uses the usual &quot;closed environment&quot; setting (an island, a cruiser, a train) to give us a small number of suspects; and then she hits us with Poirot's &quot;gather everyone together while I explain the solution&quot; scene. One of the gimmicks of this novel is that Poirot comes up with two solutions! But for the sake of those very few who do not know the ending, I will say no more. And even for those who do, there is always the joy of Suchet's reading.<br />  I have the CD edition, a format that makes it difficult to find where you last left off since each full chapter is usually given a single track number. Here Audio Partners has thoughtfully broken each chapter into several tracks so you pretty much can get back to where you were with a minimum of trouble. Tapes, of course, stay where they are--and are much better for use in autos.<br />  So by all means choose this as your next purchase, and do not forget the &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; offering while you are about it.ffering while you are about it.
B000002JR8|3.0|This is a good album, but can I clear up a big mistake that everybody seems to be making? This is one of Pantera's heaviest, but it certainly is not one of &quot;The heaviest albums ever&quot;, as one reviewer put it. &quot;Easily the heaviest band ever unleashed into the world&quot;? I don't think so. Have you lot never of the death metal scene or something?<br />Anyways, this is quite a good album, but it is not that easy to get into. Unlike other Pantera albums, you have to work with it a bit. I wouldn't recommend this to newcomers. There are some really good tracks such as &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot;, &quot;Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks&quot;, &quot;Shedding Skin&quot; and &quot;Use My Third Arm&quot; but there are also some really crap ones like &quot;Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills&quot;, &quot;25 Years&quot; and &quot;Throes Of Rejection&quot;. I find the way that &quot;Strength Beyond Strength&quot; and &quot;Use My Third Arm&quot; completely slow down so that they sound like something off a groovy sludge album really annoying, it does ruin the songs a bit. &quot;Becoming&quot;, &quot;5 Minutes Alone&quot; and &quot;I'm Broken&quot; are good but I had to listen to them quite a few times before I liked them. I will admit that there is a bit more variety among the songs than in most albums, but one of the best songs on the album is the cover of Black Sabbaths &quot;Planet Caravan&quot;, perhaps showing up some of the bands own work.<br />Vulgar Display Of Power and Cowboys From Hell are much better albums.
B00005AXEL|5.0|In her first solo album sinse 1994's &quot;Street Angel&quot;,Stevie Nicks releases possibly her best solo effort ever! Perhaps in time,even better than her multi platinum 1981 solo debut,&quot;Bella Donna&quot;. Nicks has always been one of America's best singer/songwriters,and this collection demonstrates her vivid storytelling,backed by infectuous harmonies and lush production.The initial singles,&quot;Everyday&quot;(the first video clip being played on VH1),and the fantastic rocker,&quot;Planets of the universe&quot; are already being embraced by radio,and there are many potential hit singles here! &quot;I miss you&quot; is gorgeous,and is my pick for the second video/single! &quot;Too far from Texas&quot; is charming with Natalie Maines,of Dixie Chicks backing Nicks' suprisingly twangy strong vocals! &quot;Sorcerer&quot;,with Sheryl Crow finds Nicks hitting high notes she hasn't hit sinse &quot;Dreams&quot;,with increadible ease. &quot;Fall from grace&quot; is an intence epic of a rocker. It is easily the hardest rocking song on the entire collection,ending with a fury.&quot;That made me stronger&quot; details her converstation with Tom Petty,when she asked him to help her writer's block(&quot;Well you know me better than know myself,will you write this for me? He says NO,you write your songs yourself&quot;). And what would a Stevie Nicks album be,without her long-time back-up singers,Lori Perry-Nicks,and Sharon Celani? Their gorgeous backing vocals,along with the many guests appearing on this sterling disc,delivers a most satasfying listening experiance.Stevie Nicks is an American Rock icon,and with this new release,she will continue that legacy with old and new fans alike.

B00000D9TQ|4.0|This 1998 Phil Collins greatest hits collection could have expanded into two CDs.  This would have allowed important chart hits (&quot;I Missed Again,&quot; &quot;Everyday,&quot; &quot;Don't Lose My Number&quot;) key LP tracks (&quot;Long, Long Way To Go,&quot; &quot;I Don't Care Anymore&quot;) and even B-sides (&quot;The Man With The Horn,&quot; the gorgeous &quot;We Said Hello Goodbye&quot;) to form a career retrospective on the order of Billy Joel's 1985 best-selling greatest hits set. (It may also have choked off &quot;Hits&quot;'s least successful track, Collins' lukewarm, Babyface-produced cover of Cyndi Lauper's &quot;True Colors.&quot;)<br />But &quot;Hits&quot; testifies to Collins' success as one of the Eighties most surprising solo successes. Like another 70s-into-80s chart-topper, Kenny Loggins, Collins played second part in a better-known 1970s group before breaking its attendant image with music louder, drums heavier (and cymbal-free), songs more intimate.<br />Collins vocals' stayed personal and believable, inbibed with impish humor or acute pain (&quot;Both Sides Of The Story&quot;) and even menace (most notably in his infamous signature song &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot;). This was true even when his hits fit behind mass-appeal films like &quot;Against All Odds&quot; (his first #1) &quot;White Nights&quot; (his #1 &quot;Separate Lives&quot; duet with Marilyn Martin, written by Collins collaborator Stephen Bishop) or his own 1988 &quot;Buster&quot; (his gentle cover of &quot;Groovy Kind of Love&quot;)<br />Flying solo successfully so quickly allowed Collins to indulge his love of sparse, big beat R&amp;B. His collaborations with Earth, Wind, &amp; Fire's horn section (&quot;Sussudio,&quot; &quot;Something Happened On The Way To Heaven,&quot; &quot;Easy Lover,&quot; his #1 duet with EWF lead singer Phillip Bailey)  made their trademark sound his own. Collins collaborated with legendary Motown songwriter Lamont Dozier on 1988's #1 &quot;Two Hearts,&quot; after his 1982 letter-perfect cover of Dozier's &quot;You Can't Hurry Love,&quot; served as R&amp;B balm amid the bile of &quot;Hello! I Must Be Going.&quot;<br />Like Loggins, Collins would not have the same chart impact in the 1990s as in the previous decade. He'd record a big-band jazz album, collaborate with David Crosby, chart with the occassional hit single and with the &quot;Tarzan&quot; CD soundtrack. But as with his work in Genesis, the recent 80s music revival has shown Collins' solo work more organic and durable than most from that now mostly overrated musical era. This set, and Genesis' subsequent &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; best-of, are each first-rate 80s musical documents.&quot; after his 1982 letter-perfect cover of Dozier's &quot;You Can't Hurry Love,&quot; served as R&amp;B balm amid the bile of &quot;Hello!

0896760839|2.0|Janet Arnolds book was something I used to use to make historical reproductions until I had the chance to see a garmet she had chosen to pattern in a museum. There were several blatent mistakes made in the pattern. Apperantly Ms. Arnold does not work from the garment, she works from an artists rendition of the garment, so there are many details that are overlooked. If you want an precise pattern for a historical garment, look elsewhere.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I picked this cd up out of town after over a month of anxiously awaiting its release.  It was WELL worth the wait and more.<br />This album is the classic Stevie Nicks that her fans know, love and appreciate.  There seems to be a renewed energy with each track of the cd and a vibrance to be back in the recording studio.<br />Stevie's voice remains to be that wonderful mystique quality and crystal clear in each and every song of this release.  The words of each of her songs are written with clear meaning and consistency as if Stevie were talking through her songs to get her thoughts across.  Sucessfully done too!<br />The Stevie fan is also treated to tracks done with Sheryl Crow, Macy Gray and Sarah MacLachlan.<br />This release makes this Stevie Nicks fan waiting like a child watching for Santa on Christmas Eve for the bound to be pending concert tour to go along with this awesome release!<br />Attention Stevie fans....GET THIS CD!!!
B0000549XN|5.0|Most people consider Doolittle the definitive Pixies album, but to me, the raw Surfer Rosa is the best.  Together with the Come On Pilgrim EP, they chronical the birth of one of the great American bands.  Power-pop and punk influences abound, much like they do on the albums of contemporaries the Replacements.  But where the Replacements reveled in sins of the flesh, the Pixies inspiration was creeping madness.  &quot;The Holiday Song,&quot; a highlight of the CD, unleashes two minutes of warnings against evil and incest.  &quot;Nimrod's Son&quot; comes out and explicitly lays evil and incest out for all to see.  Within seconds of the album's opening, Black Francis is spewing forth soliloquies on molestation with manic joy in his voice.  When Kim Deal takes over the vocals, on &quot;Gigantic,&quot; it to tell a tale of voyeurism and teenage sexual discovery.  All in all it's a joyous, disturbing collection of songs that formed the first blast of energetic music from the Pixies and paved the way for later journeys into Black Francis's twisted mind.  Enjoy!
630027120X|3.0|After seeing this movie for my Latin American History and Culture class, I thought hey - pretty good for an historical film.  It has a great cast (kind of odd to see DeNiro in a role like this one) and the cinematography is excellent.  The general plot is the fight for the right to land and liberty between Guarani Indians, missionaries (who supposedly want to &quot;help&quot; them) and the Europeans.  It makes the Guarani people out to be easily trainable savages and the missionaries to be selfless helpers.  But were they really?  The way events occur in this movie are pretty questionable.  I think it's really necessary to take a closer look at the racism and control issues going on in the real history before you believe everything this movie says.  The way in which the Guarani were portrayed is definitely racist, giving way too much credit to Europeans.  Other than that, (I hope I didn't discourage anyone - it's not that off) the movie was pretty good.  It gives the American audience a good general insight to what goes on in South America, because often we are a bit egotistical (if that's the word) and think that people only get pushed around in the United States.  But really it happens everywhere.  If you have any desire to know what goes on down there, take a look at &quot;The Mission.&quot;
B000003N7G|5.0|This recording is proof that God exists. Like seeing Michaelangelo's David, climbing the red rocks of Sedona or listening to the giggles of a four-month-old, hearing this disc leaves one with a sense of well-being and light, knowing that the Universe is not just a random play of molecules after all, but a deliberate dance of infinite possibilities and joy.  <br />Coltrane pushed and pushed himself his entire life, but here he just pushed his ego aside and let it flow. <br />These are not merely musical notes. They are echoes of the primordial Om, a prime example of Man's capacity for perfection. Truly A Love Supreme.<br />I guess you could say that I dig this album.
B00004LN16|5.0|I have read some of the other reviews on Amazon for Stiff Upper Lip, and the ones that complain that Brian Johnson's voice isn't as pumped anymore are absolutely nuts.  Brian's voice just gets better and better.  If you want a smooth, pop voice listen to the Back Street Boys.  A true rock fan can appreciate Brian's sound.  I was fortunate enough to catch AC/DC's show in Memphis, Tennessee and they rocked the Pyramid! Stiff Upper Lip is an awesome mix of rock and blues.  AC/DC's sound is repetitive, but isn't this what we LOVE about them?  When you do something right, don't change it!  And I hope that these guys don't stop making their hard-driving, heart-pounding style of rock and roll for a long, long, long, time.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Attention all people who want an album that is beautifully written,produced,and executed. Trouble In Shangrila, Stevie's 1st solo album in 7 years shows the singer at her absolute finest form.I think this album is even better than her classic &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. The title track has a great &quot;Stand Back&quot; quality to it. Its one of those songs that stays in your head. &quot;Planets Of The Universe&quot; is also an instant classic with Stevie at her &quot;Mystical Rockchick&quot; best. The biggest surprise to me is the country style &quot;To Far From Texas&quot; I did not think I was going to like this- but it is one of my favorites on the cd! Stevie sounds fantastic!Two other standouts are &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Bombay Sapphires&quot;.I think the best song on the cd is &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot; It details Stevie getting the confidence to write music again.&quot;That made me stronger,it made me hold onto me.&quot; The person who reportedly gave her this confidence was Tom Petty- Thank you, Tom and of course Thank you, Stevie.
B000009QPG|4.0|I bought this album because I am a heavy metal fan (Guns N Roses, Scorpions...) and everybody here gave high ratings.  Well, I think they are some what biased.  They were either used to this kind of thrash metal or like the lyrics.  I personally don't listened to the lyrics and pay more attention to overall sound with strong vocal.  In that respect this album fails some what.  I really liked their guitar (sounds like two guitars) sound but the singer (I don't konw who the singer is) can't sing.  He sounds some what like Pantera.  All he does is shout.  His vocal range is always within 1 octave.  Overall, I must say this album is OK to listen to for a heavy metal fan but no way meets the standards of Guns' N Roses or Black Sabbath.
B00000099Y|5.0|When I first heard this CD in sixth grade, I immediately dismissed it as some lousy head-thrashing junk. Even so, I made a tape of it. Soon, I started listening to it incredibly often. It eventually became, and still is, my all-time favorite CD ever. Buy this CD now; don't mind the price. You will not regret it ever. Also: Taproot - Gift; Factory 81 - Mankind; anything by Deftones; Linkin Park - Hybrid Theory; Undertow, Opiate, Lateralus (when it comes out), etc.
B00005B6C9|5.0|If you are a classic Bee Gees fan, which I am, you will LOVE this new album.  Unlike a previous reviewer who stated the contrary, this album shows how they have evolved over the past five decades, while still keeping to their roots which is what made them superstars.  There are elements of the original recordings in songs like 'Technicolor Dreams' while there are also extraordinary new classics like 'Voice In The Wilderness', which when it started reminded me of modern Def Leppard style rock 'n roll.  And, of course the title song, 'This Is Where I Came In' epitomizes what the Bee Gees are best at...making great music that is able to cross all musical genres, and astound the old fans as well as amaze the new younger ones.  If you are a fan already and have not picked this new classic up, DO SO.  If you have never bought a Bee Gees album before, this is the one to start training your ears for one of the best musical experiences you'll ever have.  I can see Grammy's adding up!
B000001EGE|4.0|What a great record.  Only a couple fillers on this one.   Everyone knows Rocket Man, and Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters has gotten more popular with the younger crowd since &quot;Almost Famous&quot; came out (deservingly so, its arguably his best song ever).  But there is so much more on this disc as well.  Infectious choruses, grat lyrics and flawless playing make this one a keeper.  If you buy one studio record other than the greatest hits packages, this would have to be the one.  Great, great music.
B000002KAT|5.0|The talent is obvious, the music:  gorgeous; and the lyrics plumb your soul.  But the singing!  I have never, never been able to stand Van Morrison's singing!  I try and I try to be able to get past it, because I can see the blatant and supple musical and lyrical talent this man has, but to no avail.  Sigh...  I do highly suggest this album to anyone interested in wonderful lyrics and music, but in the end, this music is not for me...
B000003S09|5.0|One of the pioneering works of art-rock, In The Court of the Crimson King is a surreal modernist classic.  Crimson's debut album was in fact so good that it almost led to the bands premature demise as it took them nearly 5 years to come up with another album with the same focus or strength.  Contrasted with music of the same genre of that era \\"Court\\" was unparalleled in its fierceness and songwriting, but it is the albums stunning musicianship that gives the recording its durability.<br />Greg Lake submits what is likely the strongest vocal performance of his career on an extremely challenging set of songs. Ian McDonald is perfect as the bands jack-of-all-trades.  His work on keyboards set the stage for Rick Wakeman and Tony Kaye to follow in the early `70's. Michael Giles drumming is steadier and more appropriate than his later replacement Bill Bruford.  Then, of course, there is virtuoso, Robert Fripp.   Fripp is the only member of the band to exist in each of the numerous permutations that would carry the band into the early `90's.  His unique style and experimentation differentiated King Crimson from the other progressive rock bands of the era. This skilled lineup was not to last though.  As this album was peaking at 28 on the US charts Fripp was already rehearsing the new lineup that would record the bands follow-up album, In the Wake of Poseidon.  In fact King Crimson was to continuously alter their lineups becoming somewhat of a training ground for the progressive movement.  Later incarnations of the band would see members such as John Wetton (UK, Asia), Bill Bruford (Yes, Earthworks), Bryan Ferry (Roxy Music), Boz Burell (Bad Company), Adrien Belew (Talking Heads), Tony Levin (Yes), among many others. But it was only Fripp with his odd mix of elegant classic; Hendrix-like explosions and jazz noodling that would survive each and every lineup.<br />Setting the tone for the rest of the album is the demented \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" - hard-hitting stuff in 1969 and in fact quite analogous to the industrial rock of the mid `90's.  \\"Schizoid man\\", with it's huge pumping rhythm section and bewitching guitar, rocks.  It is a song to crank your stereo up to, grab your tennis racquet (for the obligatory air guitar) and pump your fists.  The lush woodwinds and interesting drumming highlight the wistful ballad \\"I Talk to the Wind\\".  Probably the most important tune on the album is the epic \\"Epitaph\\", a 9-minute landmark that arguably ushered in the genre of symphonic rock.  Similar to \\"Epitaph\\" but even more majestically lush is the gothic \\"Moonchild\\".  Opening with an interplay between Lakes heavily processed vocals panned hard to the left channel and Fripp's decadent guitar textures answering in the right channel the piece slowly develops into a classic triumph, which surely influenced some of the early 70's work of Pink Floyd.<br />The poetic lyrics with it's medieval imagery, tales of bygone eras, and overly obvious social commentary became staples the progressive era as well as one of it's more irritating characteristics.  The band's influence, though, cannot be overstated.  Anyone wishing to investigate the roots of Yes, Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, UK, and later Asia, need look no further than this album.  In fact as evidenced by the symphonic progressive bands of the `90's with bands such as Anekdoten, Anglagard, and White Willow.  It is apparent that Crimson still has a hold on those which classify themselves as \\"Art Rock\\", and it is usually a title which is self imposed.<br />The production of the album was adequate although a bit thin despite the multitude of tracks and layers of instrumentation however early transfers to compact disc where awful.  Caroline has since gone back and worked with the original masters of the entire Crimson catalog and the results are more than satisfactory.  If you have an older CD of this album it is worth the $... to replace it with the newer CD.  You will hear textures that never came through on the original.<br />King Crimson has always been a band that was appreciated by musicians, but the general public never seemed to catch on. The lack of any humor, absurd lyrics, and the absence of radio airplay certainly contributed to this trend.  In the Court of the Crimson King is such an important and influential recording that it belongs in the collection of any music fan - regardless of their opinions of the progressive genre.  With the bands remarkable playing, groundbreaking orchestration, and the recordings relative obscurity, \\"Court\\" should find a place in any good diverse CD collection.  Additionally, the cover art by Barry Godber is one of the best album covers in all of Rock &amp; Roll.

6302787122|4.0|This movie is really wonderful.  Jack returns home after several years a changed man, the abuser he used to be was now a loving caring human being.  But are the changes really changes or a totally different person.  This movie never gives a direct answer as to the identity of Jack.  Reflecting on the movie over and over, I weigh all the evidence.  When &quot;Jack&quot; is first arrested, Laurel asks him to tell her the truth no matter what it is and she will stand by him.  He tells her he did not committ the murder.  Yet we know it was the real Jack sommersby who did committ the murder.  If this man is the genuine person we think he is, then that would conclude he is really not &quot;Jack&quot; because &quot;Jack&quot; is a murderer.  Yet he is determined to tell the court that he is the real &quot;Jack&quot; even if it means death.  This proves that he is the caring man we think he is because if he decided to save his life and be Horis Townsend,  his signiture would be a forgery and his community would loose everything.  Evidence would still support that he is not &quot;Jack&quot; in my mind because if he were the real &quot;Jack&quot; he lied to his wife about being a murderer, but then in privacy when she asks him who he really is, he say he is &quot;Jack&quot;.  The pieces don't fit and I am confused.  I think the purpose here is for each of us to decide who &quot;Jack&quot; really is.  Finally, one element that was not even concidered in the movie is that if Horis Townsend and Jack Sommersby looked exactly alike, couldn't it have been possible that Horis Townsend was the murderer and those around him believed it was Jack Sommersby??  That would fit because that would mean Jack was telling the truth to his wife AND is the real Jack Sommersby.  That possibility didn't even come up in the court which suprised me because that would bring about reasonable doubt as to the identity of the murderer and set Jack free.
0780020685|5.0|First of all I would like to say that there was someone with the misconception that the Seven Samurai copied the Magnificent Seven, however they are terribly mistaken. The Seven Samurai is a marvelous masterpiece that should be added to anyone's video collection.<br />The movie is a three hour long epic that tells the story of a small village of farmers under raid of forty brigands as they are called. And about four of the peasants bother to find and hire several samurai. However after getting their first samurai they learn that they are going to need seven minimum samurai to protect the village. This movie has very enriching characters that help create a very wonderful movie. If you do not have this movie than you should get it as soon as you can. This is one movie that deserves a sixth star.

B0000542D1|5.0|Being an old codger, I well remember the hysteria of the Beatles' 1964 tour of Australia. There really were screaming, fainting girls (although the ones in the film were paid extras! Phil Collins (later of Genesis) was an extra as a boy in this film - can you spot him!). It's a funny, cheerful movie, with great Beatles music, and very clean! (A reference to Wilfred Bramble as Steptoe senior, &quot;you dirty old man!&quot; in Steptoe and Son).<br />If you can get to see 'The Running, Jumping, Standing Still Film&quot; by Richard Lester, you will see the humor that drove 'A Hard Day's Night'. The short was included on the end of some VHS editions of the film, with an interview with Lester. The Beatles had seen that 11 minute short, had grown up on Spike Milligan and The Goons, and it was natural to do the surreal humor and the semi-smart lines. It isn't Marx Bros. humor, except in humor's universality and the Marx Bros.' brilliance and sense of the ridiculous.<br />Enough analysis: &quot;Analyzing comedy can only lead to tragedy&quot; (Alex Buzo). Enjoy this movie. I do (in my 40s), my children do (under 10s) and for all sorts of reasons. One of may favorite scenes is John's encounter with a woman in a studio corridor &quot;you look just like him&quot;, where they hold a conversation that on the one hand is full of meaning, yet on the other hand is totally meaningless. This is Goon Show humor, with surrealism, and just plain funny on a number of levels.<br />BTW, the papers falling from the helicopter at the end of the film are the photos upon which Paul's grandfather forged the lads' signatures, then tried to sell to the fans. Paul throws them out of the chopper as it lifts off, his grandfather being handcuffed to the seat inside the door with the offending photos on his lap. And note John Bluthel as the car thief in the middle of the police chase, stealing the old Humber Super Snipe. Derek Guyler as the police sergeant. The lads playing in the field with joyful abandon having escaped from the studio, including the cricket 'long run up' and 'brilliant diving, running catch' routine we all played as kids, even before the movie.<br />Enjoy!

B00003CXPD|5.0|Gritty northern drama, that inspires one. Here the theme of going against the grain, of the value of being an individual and non-conformist are celebrated.  Aside from that the filme was interesting in recounting the social background of the early '80s in the UK, of the real hardships the miners faced. Great acting all the way round, strikes a gritty realist approach.  One can almost taste the soot and coal dust in watching this film.  Great songs too.
0425098532|5.0|&quot;Sad Cypress&quot; deals with the eternal triangle which always ends with sadness for someone.  In this case, Elinor Carlisle is the odd girl out as her fiance and distant cousin Roderick Welman falls madly in love with his and Elinor's childhood friend, Mary Gerrard, after Mary returns from years abroad.  The three of them had been great friends at Hunterbury, the lavish estate of Mary's aunt Mrs. Laura Welman.  Mrs. Welman had hoped Elinor and Roderick would marry one day and live at Hunterbury.  Mrs. Welman dies suddenly without leaving a will.  As her next of kin, Elinor inherits all.  Although Mrs. Welman had spoken frequently of providing for Roderick and Mary, the lack of a will leaves them without recourse.  In the midst of all this upheaval, Elinor prepares lunch for Mary one day, and Mary dies of morphine poisoning.  With suspicion falling heavily on Elinor, the body of Mrs. Welman is exhumed and found to also contain morphine poisoning.  All fingers point to Elinor for having killed Mary out of jealousy and her aunt in order to get the full estate.  Only one person, Dr. Peter Lord, believes in Elinor's innocence and he calls in the inimitable Hercule Poirot to investigate.<br />An excellent courtroom sequence and outstanding characters make this one of Christie's best, in my opinion.

6303942830|5.0|This is a magnificent action drama based on the classic novel by James Fennimore Cooper that is crowned by a superb soundtrack, a beautiful setting and excellent photography.  The casting is outstanding and the acting is consistently top notch as well.<br /><br />The central theme in this movie set at the time of the French and Indian Wars is the classic struggle between the courage and honor of the protagonist Hawkeye, a white man adopted as the son of Mohican warrior Chingachgook, played by Lewis, and the evil vengeance-seeking antagonist Magua, a bellicose Huron war leader played by Wes Studi.  Hawkeye, his father and his adopted brother Uncas attempt to lead two British sisters, Cora and Alice Munro, daughters of British Army Colonel Munro, to the safety of their father during an outbreak of war.  The motivation behind Magua's obsession with revenge against the two Munro girls and their father may not be clear on the first viewing, but it stems from a previous military campaign in the French and Indian War in which British Colonel Munro attacked a Huron village, killing Magua's wife and children in the process.  Magua then swears revenge on \\"Gray Hair\\" Munro and \\"his seed.\\"  Magua joins the British army as a native scout, disguising his identity as a Huron war leader, as part of a plan to murder Munro's two daughters.<br /><br />The various subplots of this movie are excellently developed.  The main subplot, involving Major Duncan (played by Steven Waddington) shows the remarkable growth of a cowardly, dishonest English aristocrat/officer seeking the hand of Cora Munro (played by Madeline Stowe) into a man who discovers honor by sacrificing himself to the Hurons in order to set free the woman he loves into the arms of another man.  The romances between the two Munro sisters and Hawkeye and his adopted brother Uncas (played by Eric Schweig) are sparsely portrayed, as others have suggested, but I think this treatment of romance in the midst of a brutal war and personal tragedy is far more realistic than if these relationships were fully expanded.  These actors convey far more emotion and tension in their exchange of questioning, smouldering glances than by swapping unnecessary dialogue.<br /><br />There is a deep emotional impact in virtually all parts of this movie.  The background is primarily dark and dreary until the closing scenes involving the chase of Magua's band through the beautiful mountainous cliffs.  The director, Michael Mann, distinctly portrays the dirt and squalor of war in the scenes at the fort, as well as the horrors of combat in the Huron ambush of the British Army after their release by the chivalrous French commander. Similarly, the earlier scene on the way to the fort, passing the burned out cabin and mutilated bodies of settlers, is quite poignant.  Cora Munroe demands that they provide a Christian burial for the settlers, but Hawkeye forbids this action, snapping tersely, \\"These were not strangers.  They were friends.  And we leave them as they lie.\\"  It is at this point that Cora truly begins to understand the harsh practicalities of frontier life.<br /><br />The hand-to-hand combat scenes in this movie are exceptionally well-choreographed and appear as realistic as any such scenes from any movie.  At first the idea of Hawkeye, accompanied solely by his father Chingachgook (Russell Means) and Uncas, attacking Huron war bands at least four or five times their size seems a bit far- fetched, but the hard, stoic and courageous expressions on the faces of Lewis, Means and Scheig leave little doubt but that they will overcome their adversaries.<br /><br />Wes Studi does a simply outstanding job playing the evil Magua, seething with anger and venom as few movie antagonists have ever done before.  On a superficial level, Magua seems purely one dimensional, existing only for revenge.  **** SPOILER ALERT *****  However, he is actually subtly multi-dimensional; are not his motivations to seek revenge againstMunro for the deaths of his family quite similar to Chingachgook's motivations in the final scene as he avenges the death of his son Uncas by killing Magua?<br /><br />The final scene of this film is hauntingly beautiful, as Chingachgook and Hawkeye perform a Mohican eulogy for the departed Uncas and one realizes that Chingachgook is now the very last member of the decimated Mohican tribe; hence, Cooper's title.  I can count on one hand the number of films that brought tears to my eyes, and this was one of them.<br /><br />This film has been compared to other, more recent large scale epics, such as Braveheart and Gladiator, but the comparison is not entirely apt.  The former two films are indeed very good, but are merely pieces of entertainment.  In contrast, Last of the Mohicans is a stunningly entertaining work of art.
B00004XOWM|3.0|This album isn't bad.  What could have been a great album ended up being average mainly because the only talent shown here was the ability to come up with dozens of words (not including the f word) that rhymes with the words &quot;Limp Bizkit&quot;.   I'm not one to sit back and try and analyze the cosmic significance of my music ... I just like to be entertained.  But come on!!  The level of narcissism shown in the lyrics of this album is just too much.  Unless that's what you like in your music.<br />Fred, I think it's time you (and your band) come down off your high horses and try and make some real music.

Pat Bateman here, i would just like to say a few words about 'duke', the excellent album by genesis.  to be honest i was never that impressed by genesis during the peter gabriel days, i found their music a bit too art school.  but it was this album where phil collins took the reins, that i started to get interested.  anyway, must be off to multilate and decapitate.
B000002UAI|4.0|With the exception of ... old \\"Mr. Moonlight,\\" BEATLES FOR SALE is a very, very good album. It's tone is, overall, more sedate than their previous efforts. However, let us not forget the rockers \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" \\"Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey\\", \\"Eight Days A Week\\" (a classic), \\"Honey Don't\\" (with a great perfomance by Ringo) and George's fabulous cover of \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" (love it!). Quite a fun bunch of songs to dance to, indeed. Besides being the perfect opener for the record, \\"No Reply\\" has a more narrative quality to it--compared to their earlier songs--exploring the other side of being in love. In fact, \\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm A Loser,\\" \\"Baby's in Black,\\" \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party,\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" all display more complex, introspective themes. Except for \\"What You're Doing\\" (a Paul song), those songs show John feeling wronged or like there's something wrong with him. \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" is simply beautiful, as is \\"Every Little Thing.\\" Whether I'm listening to it alone in my room or dancing around to the faster songs with others, I find BEATLES FOR SALE to be a wonderfully enjoyable album. Although the Beatles would top it soon with HELP!, BEATLES FOR SALE is a great collection of songs (except the aforementioned \\"Mr. Moonlight\\") and I hope you will check it out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
0790751305|2.0|I have seen probably all of Eastwood's westerns and as several other reviewers have stated, this is at the bottom of Clint's barrel.  First, this cowboy flick rides a very tired old poney - the theme stolen and copied from Shane by so many other westerns of former gunfighter retires to lead normal life, must unretire to take on evil character set on running the county.  Second, the acting and the script are both flat and uninteresting.  There have been too many lifetime achievement awards given out lately for artists of various sorts who deserved but never received honors in the past and whose recent work is mediocre at best.  Unforgiven falls into that category.  If you are looking for a great Eastwood western, check out the Outlaw Josey Wales, Fistful of Dollars or the more recent and much better Pale Rider.
B00005AXEL|4.0|Honestly, this is the first Stevie Nicks album I have purchased.  I am a pretty big fan of Fleetwood Mac and with their album THE DANCE released a couple years ago, I thought I would pick up the new Stevie Nicks album!  I am glad I did!  She has such a different voice that it is like a breath of fresh air and orginality in the pop world!  The 3 best songs are TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA, EVERY DAY and TOO FAR FROM TEXAS!  For all Stevie and Fleetwood fans go pick this up!  Peace!
B000005J56|1.0|I find it simply unbelievable that this CD has evoked the response it has, which sadly confirms how little appreciation there has been for music that comes from outside the mainstream. This is, in short, a mediocre production that does not deserve to represent, as it does to so many, what Cuban music is all about. Cuban music did not die, only to be resurected when we found it conveniently packaged for us, and it should not be that because a conceited American music icon produced it, that a very un-representative album should became acceptable, and finally, immensely popular, in a way out of all proportion with its merits. Can anyone claim this CD compares, for even a moment, with any one CD by a truly great Cuban group like Sierra Maestra? Yet these Cuban musicians are far less well known and live largely in obscurity. Listen to them, or go see them in concert, and you will see what a sad joke this re-discovery has been. The sadder joke is how Cooder's playing on the album betrays his own misurderstanding and lack of appreciation for the music, and how many latin music &quot;experts&quot; were dupped into its endorsement. Don't fool yourselves.
B00005ABI8|5.0|You've probably heard the radio tracks: I will survive &amp; The distance, for example.  And they are great.

Not a bad song on the album.  Check out Open Book, Stickshifts, and She'll come back...
B00003CX59|4.0|Tim Burton, the director of this movie, is a really twisted filmmaker. He has made some films that were meant for kids in the past that were really creepy. Just look at the 2 Batman films he made. Those movies were so darkly violent and twisted that they came very close to the R-rating. But this time Paramount put their trust in Burton to do this R-rated flick and let it totally rip. The result, unfortunately, is not exactly what I'd hoped for. The movie's look is absolutely amazing, the most stunningly beautiful Burton film to date (and that's saying something). But what disturbs me is the complicated plot, which this movie didn't need, and some lacklustre performances. The movie is definitely spooky and even humorous at points, but some of the acting is below par, especially Christina Ricci. Casper van Dien is as mediocre as he usually is, Christopher Walken is wasted in a microscopic role, and so are Ian McDiarmid and Michael Gough. <br />But, focusing on the movie, it's definitely worth watching once. So rent it first and, if you like it, then buy it!
0385421982|1.0|It truly makes me sad that the American public has such little ability to make an independent, intelligent judgment about works of fiction that they cannot see how awful of a writer Grisham is.  It further disturbs me that people actually liked this nimbwitted caricature of a legal thriller. Please America, wake up!<br />First, while Grisham may have attended law school, I doubt that he retained more than 20% of the knowledge he may have acquired.  As an experienced attorney with a knowledge of both civil and criminal law, I can assure you that if Grisham writes any actual legal content into his novels, his editors must be deleting it.  If he has utilized any knowledge of law that cannot be gleemed by talking to a second year law student over lunch, I must have missed it.<br />The biggest example of Grisham's lack of legal acumen is displayed by the main plot line in The Pelican Brief - that some law student could somehow read materials from an obscure Louisiana case and extrapolate their significance to include a presumption that the case would eventually be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court - is just ridiculous.  The odds that an attorney with 40 years of appellate experience, let alone a mere law student, could tie the significance of the assasination of several Supreme Court justices to this remote case in Louisiana is about as likely to happen as being struck by an UFO on the top of the Empire State Building.  The Supreme Court accepts so few cases a year that there is little likelihood of being able to predict which petitions the Court will grant.  Accepting this premise would be about as easy as accepting a filmmaker's decision to cast Shaquille O'Neal for a role playing Tyra Banks.<br />Grisham uses the same tired, cliched themes throughout his novels (at least through The Client, which I completed and then determined not to waste any further time reading Grisham's works).  Aren't people getting just a bit tired of his omnipresent theme that one cannot trust law enforcement, particularly the FBI?  Don't the all-encompassing powers of the evil businesses and their shareholders stretch boundaries of credibility too thin?  Do people actually enjoy reading works of fiction containing subplots that have no satisfying conclusion?<br />The Pelican Brief is simply an altogether inadequate piece of fiction that has been churned out on the heels of The Firm, rather than painstakingly crafted by a writer with appreciation for quality writing.  Please people, set higher standards for yourselves than this slop.law enforcement, particularly the FBI?

B000000W5L|5.0|EXILE ON MAIN STREET probably deserves to stand as the Rolling Stones ultimate rock-and-roll monument. Their status as the world's greatest rock band rests here as much as anywhere. From the beginning of &quot;Rocks Off&quot; to the end of &quot;Soul Survivor&quot;, the band and several collaborators absolutely rip their way through 18 cuts. Tempo and styles vary. Blues, country-rock, R&amp;B, and even some gospel influences appear, but it all fuses into great rock. The album sums up where the Stones had been and what they had become by the time it was made. And it's simply great. Every cut is a good one. Two full discs in the original LP format and there's not a letdown anywhere. Brian Jones' influence is clearly gone, but it is also clear that Jagger and Richards have become mature artists and are very much in command.<br />Musically and lyrically, EXILES... is the sound of life on the street (specifically in New York, it seems). It's sleazy, it's rough, it's crude, sometimes dingy and dangerous, but there's never a dull moment. The only downside to it is that it left the Stones with nowhere to go. It's an achievement they've never been able to match.<br />Despite all that, EXILE... isn't my personal favorite Stones' album. Don't get me wrong. I listen to it and enjoy it, but the dense, layered, brassy sound and gospel influences just doesn't appeal to my ear like the simpler, more basic style heard from AFTERMATH through LET IT BLEED. I guess I miss the Brian Jones touch.<br />Personal preferences aside, this is a great rock album. Probably one of the two or three greatest. If you like rock and roll, then EXILE... is a must for your music collection. Listen to the whole thing. It doesn't get much better than this. My highest recommendation.
B00005AXEL|4.0|THIS IS DEFINATELY A GREAT ALBUM AND DERFINATELY STEVIE'S MOST FOCUSED AND CONCISE WORK SINCE 1981'S SMASH BELLA DONNA. ALMOST EVERY SONG IS AMAZING, HOWEVER, THERE ARE A FEW WEAK POINTS. &quot;BOMBAY SAPHIRE&quot; WITH MACY GRAY IS AWFUL AND &quot;THAT MADE ME STRONGER&quot; IS NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT EITHER LYRICALLY OR MUSICALLY. EVEN SO, SONGS LIKE &quot;PLANETS OF THE UNIVERSE&quot;, &quot;LOVE CHANGES&quot;, AND &quot;I MISS YOU&quot; (WHICH i THINK IS AMONG THE TOP 10 BEST SONGS STEVIE EVER WROTE) MAKE THE ALBUM A NECESSITY FOR ANYONE SEARCHING FOR MUSIC WITH MEANING WHICH IS VIRTUALLY VOID THESE DAYS...CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER IN CONCERT THIS SUMMER!

B00005AXEL|5.0|After the very forgettable &quot;Street Angel&quot; hit the shelves in 1994, the consensus around the rock world seemed to be that Stevie Nicks had lost her ability to write a truly great song. I'd even say the last time she wrote a truly great song was in 1982 (&quot;Gypsy&quot;).<br />But Nicks dispels the notion with the release of Trouble in Shangri-la, her eighth release (including her best-of CD &quot;Timespace&quot; and her boxed set, &quot;Enchanted&quot;) as a solo artist. Nicks collaborates with fellow rocker Sheryl Crow, who produced five of the CD's 13 songs, Dixie Chick Natalie Maines, Sarah McLachlan, and Macy Gray to come up with a record that stands on a par with her best works of her career.<br />The songs combine the old (&quot;Candlebright&quot; was written in 1970; Sorcerer was written in 1974) with the new (&quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; was originally written in 1979, but the song has verses Nicks penned in 2000 and &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;), plus a wide range of styles.<br />Oh, and about the &quot;hasn't written a truly great song since 1982&quot; bit? The highly-charged rocker &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; dispels that notion.
6305426651|4.0|&quot;We won!&quot;  Those are the words that many Jewish survivors exclaimed at the end of one of the most horrendous acts of history, the holocaust.  People were taken from their homes to live in camps that punished them for following a certain religion.  Families were separated, lives were taken, and this horrific atrocity left an appalling impression on those survivors.  The Italian masterpiece, Life is Beautiful, captivates the contemporary generation with a vivid picture of the holocaust.  While the event is tragic, the movie's tale contains a touch of humor from the view of a terrified father who sacrifices everything in order to save his young son's life.             As time has progressed, the generations have forgotten the events that transpired in the past.  Most schools do not extensively touch upon the tragedy and the hardships that the Jews overcame through the holocaust.  I never understood what really happened, and the damage it caused over the entire world.  By watching this movie, I was able to see the affect it had on someone who experienced the torture.  Roberto Benigni plays Guido, a Jewish waiter who marries the woman of his dreams, Dora.  They fall madly in love and have a son who is their most precious possession.  The family becomes separated when they are taken to a concentration camp in Italy.  The story had such an impact on me, that now i understand completely how parents could sacrifice everything to save the one's they love.             Guido lies to his son, Joshua, about the holocaust because he wants to protect him from the emotional baggage that stemmed from being in the concentration camp.  He tells his son that the holocaust is all a big game, which makes the movie have a humorous touch to it.  The person who attains one thousand points will be the winner and receive a huge reward, a real tank.  This is what Joshua is striving for throughout the entire holocaust, while his father is risking his own life in order to keep his son from discovering the truth.  This movie shows how much a child means to a parent.  During the holocaust, children were put into gas chambers, and the parents had to live with the sorrow of their death.  I can understand why a father would do everything in his power to give his child protection, reassurance, and strength.             Even though there is a humoristic side, the movie also portrays the tragic side of the event.  It is hard to watch a family be torn apart and live each day wondering if each member is still alive.  The Jews are stripped of their privacy and rights to live a healthy and normal life.  They are forced to do extensive work with little to eat, and if they refuse, death is the only option.  It was horrendous to watch everyone be treated so violently and without compassion.            Family loyalty, trying to remain happy, and losing hope were all aspects of the holocaust.  Life is Beautiful wraps all of those things into one film that intrigues the contemporary generation.  It does no just inform the audience of the historical accuracy but also gives a personal experience of a family struggling to survive the holocaust.  I never knew how tragic this experience was, but now after witnessing it in the film, I will never forget the emotion and the trauma, which it caused in so many peoples' lives.  Through his father's loving deceit, Joshua does not have to face the harsh reality of the constant struggle for religious freedom that plagued the Jewish community.  Guido shows how the strength of family can overcome the prejudices of society.  Even though the Jews endured numerous hardships and obstacles, the victims of the holocaust can now truly say, &quot;We won!&quot;
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is the best DVD in my collection.  It is loaded with so many goodies you could spend all day going through it.  The movie is, in my opinion, the greatest comic movie of all time.  This DVD could be considered a piece of art.  It contains 3 behind the scenes documentaries, screen tests, added scenes originally cut from the theatrical release, deleted scenes, a feature length commentary by director Richard Donner and creative consulant Tom Mankiewicz, and you can watch the movie with the only audio being John Williams' wonderful score.  It also includes Dolby Surround Sound, and trailers.<br />The movie itself is worth the money for the DVD.  It is loaded with two time Academy Award winners Gene Hackman and Marlon Brando and has an array of other great actors that round out this movie magnificently.  Being a huge Superman fan, I'm rather biased, but if you, too, are a Superman fan, do not hesitate, purchase this DVD today.
B0000020C4|4.0|The Tenth Anniversary Cast Recording has to be one of the best recordings of Les Miserables ever!! Clom Wilkinson plays a perfect Valjean. Philip Quast IS Javert, no one can even hope to compare with his rendition of 'Stars.' Michael Ball is an excellent Marius, but I can't get too excited about him, seeing as Marius is my worst favorite character. Lea Salonga portrays Eponine beautifully. I'm in a constant war with my friends, ever supporting Salonga as the BEST Eponine there ever was. I really can't insult Judy Kuhn (or however its spelled) cause I can't remember there EVER being a Cosette that I enjoyed listening to.<br />My one real complaint is the casting of Enjolras. Anthony Warlow is without a doubt, the most powerful, convincing Enjolras there ever was and ever will be! For the reason of Enjolras only I prefer the Complete International Symphonic Cast Recording. Michael Ball and Philip Quast both turn in other stunning performances in the CSR. However, I much prefer Salonga over Shimada. I guess its all a matter of opinion, but the TAC is missing my ANTHONY WARLOW!!
B000009O8A|1.0|I got hold of a copy of this movie in the UK. A friend and I watched it up until the first rape scene,being well rounded induviduals we were utterly sickened by what we saw and turned it off. Admittedly banning movies is not a good idea but are movies like this really needed? AVOID.
0812550706|5.0|Ok, one more review probably won't matter... But what the hell! This is by far the best book I have ever read topped off by a series that is pretty dang good. The first novel is definitely the masterpiece!
0783230710|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies ever made.  In fact, it is a great shame that it did not win the Academy Award for Best Picture.  The way that director Ron Howard and his team put the film together is truly amazing.  Also, the scenes transition beautifully with great color ambience combined with avid camera angles.  Additionally, the filming aspects clearly indicate an attention for detail and authenticity.  However, the acting and screenwriting are the aspects that make this film truly amazing.  The all-star cast including Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise puts on a terrific performance as they portray their characters as dynamically as possible.  Nevertheless, Ed Harris put on the best overall presentation with the exception of Hanks.  His intensity and overall screen appearance are incredibly realistic, and they cause the viewer to forget that he is watching a movie but rather viewing the action live.  Lastly, the sound effects and musical compositions put the icing on the cake.  The sound synchronization as well as the emotionally appealed soundtracks accent the action on the screen in a way that creates the full film experience.  Thus, all of the technical aspects as well as those of the sheer entertainment value contribute parts to form an excellent whole as the film Apollo 13.

B00000099Y|5.0|My lame words cannot do this album justice. I have listened to this CD nearly every day since it was released 5 years ago. The lyrics are great...meaningful, amusing, angry, sad, etc. They just cover so many emotions. The music is unparalleled. The base, drums and guitar are some of the hardest and best I have ever heard, and Maynard's voice...incredible... It doesn't matter...this album has 9 great songs, so it isn't like they are relying on the filler. If you don't like it..just skip it. There is plenty of meat on this album. Nothing like it anywhere. Buy it. NOW.
B00005AXEL|5.0|From the opening chords of the title track and its magnificent chorus you can tell that Stevie Nicks is back in top form. This album is a true testament to the fantastic, talented and skilled abilities of Stevie as a songwriter, singer and musician. It is great to have her back. Buy the album and you won't regret it.
B00005ASOC|5.0|awesome .....a must see movie...u will luv it
6303921248|5.0|I believe I have reviewed this miniseries about- oh, seven times.  But every time I watch it, I cannot help but express my admiration by writing one more review.<br />The production is perfect in every detail.  They unfortunately cut out quite a bit of enjoyable dialogue between our main characters (Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy) towards the end of the novel, and they added a few gratutious scenes, but who can blame them?  They were so carried away by the sheer mystery and intrigue of Darcy's character that they simply MUST elaborate.  I want to particularly commend the casting agents in choosing so formidable an actor as Colin Firth for the part of Darcy.  Since he is as close to a real-life Darcy as we will ever get, no one could have brought life to our handsome hero better.  Though he made Darcy seem more morose and less lively than in the novel (smile, Colin, smile!  You DO have teeth, don't you?), I can't imagine a better job being done by a human- see the normally splendid Laurence Olivier botch the part entirely in an earlier production.  Firth recently starred in a similar story, I am told, called &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;.  One reveiwer summed up Firth's character in such a way as to describe our Darcy fairly well- &quot;He lurks on the sidelines, looking luscious but still acting emotionally constipated.&quot;  Or, &quot;Firth, on the other hand (as opposed to Hugh Grant) must unbend to become lovable, and we love him then mainly because we know what trouble it was for him.&quot;  It seems Colin is fairly typecast. (&lt;:  He has a lovesick, yet intense look about him that throws him into the &quot;tormented misanthrope with a heart of gold&quot; role every time.<br />As for Jennifer Ehle, who plays the lovely and bewitching Elizabeth Bennet, she has the &quot;fine eyes&quot; and the sparkling wit for the role.  Though her phsyique does not match the description in the book (what little there is, anyway), there wasn't much you can do whenfaced with such a splendid actress.  She had a wonderful way of attempting to force words out at certain times, looking for all the world like a sensible young woman suddenly losing her grip on reality and passionately wishing for a marital union that she beleived could never be.  Mostly she did this towards the end when Darcy would come a-calling with good friend Bingley (Cripsin Bonham-Carter), who in turn was in pursuit of Elizabeth's older sister Jane.  Complicated?  Yes.  But really fun.<br />We watch with delight as Elizabeth's early derision of Darcy gradually turns to tolerance, then to friendship, then to love.   The plot goes thusly.  Elizabeth Bennet, a very sensible and clever lady of twenty, has a silly mother, a disinterested father, and three idiotic younger sisters (not to mention a kindhearted older one).  The sly army officer Wickham's (Adrian Lukas) lies (or rather half-truths) about Darcy support Elizabeth's ill-informed opinion of that great gentleman, formed at a party wherein he stood in the corner and glared.  When she learns the truth about Wickham's deplorable conduct with Darcy's younger sister upon Darcy's ill-fated marriage proposal to Elizabeth (he loves her passionately even though she is beneath him in social status), she very nearly kills herself with remorse.  She made a terrible mistake- judging by first impressions.  &quot;One (man) has all the goodness (Darcy), and the other all the appearance of it (Wickham).&quot;  Later, when Wickham runs off with Elizabeth's thoughtless young sister, much in the same manner in which he attempted to elope with Darcy's, a mysterious rescuer finds out the naughty couple, and pays off Wickham to marry the idiot girl.  Could it be- Darcy? (&lt;: &quot;If you WILL thank me, let it be for yourself alone.  Your family owes me nothing...I beleive I thought only of you,&quot; he says the Elizabeth when she attempts to express her gratitude for his help.  He then proceeds to propose again, with greatersucess.  I do hope I haven't spoiled anything- ah well, the plot is transparent enough to begin with.  It is the delightful characters, not the hackneyed story, that capture out interest.  FIVE STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!
6305399212|5.0|I first saw Aliens a couple of years ago, and I fell in love with it.  It had everything an action movie needs: violence, language, a couple of jokes(Hudson), and best of all, guns, lots of guns.  The special effects are wonderful in this movie.  They surpass most of the special effects in movies today, and this movie was made almost 15 years ago.  Ripley is rescued from her first encounter with the aliens, and she later decides to go with the marines to LB-421.  The marines arrive there and there is no sign of civilian life.  They discover a colony of aliens, but they are too late, they're already under attack.  And then comes the violence.  They have to fight to get out of there and they're low on ammo.  What could be better?  The answer: nothing.  This movie is far superior to the other movies in the series.  This is a must see for all action fans.
0792842499|2.0|Especially in lieu of the many other Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leonne collaborations that far outdistance this predictable and utterly ridiculous story.<br />Clint as always is great.  Wallach is such a goof it's totally implausible that he would have made it to the end of the film without getting killed.  <br />I'll take For a Few Dollars More any day over this.
0385484518|4.0|Mitch Albom's account of his reunion with his dying college professor is a moving portrayal of the power of friendship when faced with the harsh reality of a terminal disease. Morrie Schwartz was a teacher, mentor and friend to Albom. His impact on the writer, even after a 20 year absence is palpable. Upon hearing of Morrie's illness, Albom takes it upon himself to visit Morrie....on Tuesdays, of course. They talk about the tough issues that face all of us as we go about our lives: love, friendship, morality and death. It is these conversations about death that are the core of the book. Morrie knows he is dying and is attempting to settle his affairs before his time comes. But for Morrie this doesn't mean only checking that his will is in order or that his family is provided for. He takes the broader view and wants to settle up with friends and family, making sure they know he loves them. Morrie finds it in himself to actually enjoy his death and the opportunities it provides him to gain clarity in his thoughts about the world and living. <br />Don't be put off by the subject matter. While `death' is at the core of this book, it is not at its heart. The heart is reserved for love and the redeeming power of a friendship that is not shackled by age or distance or expectation. I can't help thinking how much better off we would all be if we each had someone in our life like Morrie, if only for a little while.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I loved this film. It showed complex but loving relationships between father, son, brother. The female characters were on point. It was amazingly creative. And BOY COULD he dance!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Go see it, if only to stretch your mind.
B000002ADT|5.0|Kind of Blue is a masterpiece that everyone should be priveleged to enjoy.  It has quickly become one of my favorite albums.  I recommend that everyone buy this item!!!
B00005B6C9|5.0|Simply put, this is a fantastic pop album. It showcases the talents of a legendary supergroup while simultaneously highlighting the individual personalities of its members. Every track here is imminently listenable. Check out Robin's &quot;Embrace&quot; (which just screams for a club remix) and &quot;Deja Vu&quot;, which are perfectly suited to his tenor voice. Maurice lends his deeper but soulful pipes on &quot;Man In The Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking on Air&quot; (great hook in that one, the &quot;wait for the summer&quot; bit). And Barry's distinctive &quot;Loose Talk Costs Lives&quot; is classic Bee Gees (think &quot;Too Much Heaven&quot; or &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;), as is &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; (in the vein of &quot;Alone&quot; or even &quot;One&quot;). Any of these tracks could be a pop or adult contemporary hit (as I expect the title track will be), and the remainder are strong tracks which appeal to different moods and themes (sentimental - &quot;Wedding Day&quot;, rockin' - &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot;, whimsical - &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, emotional - &quot;The Extra Mile&quot;, angry/frustrated/ticked at the world - &quot;Voice In The Wilderness&quot;). This album was released just last week and I haven't stopped listening to it since. A definate buy if you're into melodic, well-crafted pop.
0156347113|5.0|&gt; Interesting in the way _Mein Kampf_ is., April 17, 2001  &gt;Reviewer: teste101 (see more about me) from Australia &gt;Now that the &quot;century of the state&quot; is over and done with, it's &gt;fun to look back on some of the century's larger errors.<br />&gt;One of the strangest was the &quot;economist&quot; (or whatever), Keynes.  &gt;Around the third quarter of the 20th century,<br />I have to point out that John Maynard Keynes died in 1946<br />&gt;the immense suffering, poverty and horror caused by &quot;Keynesian&quot; &gt;(ie, socialist, money-spending) governments became obvious and &gt;undeniable, even to Keynes.(Even though he had been dead for 25 years I suppose?) <br />This is a political attack and non-sense as nations such as the USA and Great Britain have done rather well by following his advice. The damage caused to Third world economies has been caused by a huge number of factors, mostly war and following Marxist priciples of economy.<br />&gt;Keynes was asked if had a shred of guilt or unrest that his &gt;pseudo-philosophy had caused so much poverty and pain to so &gt;many millions, that his very name was used to describe that &gt;type of &quot;Keynesian&quot; socio-economic system. His reply was &quot;oh &gt;well...we're all dead in the long run.&quot;<br />I'd like to point out the exact quote and it's circumatances lest anyone take this persons comments as truthful.<br />Keynes wrote after being told that things would work out allright in the long run: &quot;This long run is a misleading guide to current affairs, In the long run we are all dead.&quot;  <br />&gt;Oh well, Keynes is dead now, I suppose.<br />&gt;If you find it intriguing to read, say, Karl Marx (a bizarre &gt;figure associated with early socialism), by all means have a &gt;read of Keynes.<br />&gt;(All Keynes books are as odd, unintelligible and pointless as &gt;the other, so it doesn't really matter which one you have a &gt;look at.)<br />I would advise that anyone interested in why depressions and booms in world markets occur and why the USA had such a large budget overspend for so long (and did very well because of it) really ought to give this book a try as it is the basis of virtualy all modern economic theories on how to tackle such problems. Yes it is difficult and yes it is worthwhile.
B000006OS2|2.0|The movie is a great movie and it is a shame Goodtimes Home Video had to butcher it that bad(blurry,choppy,etc..). I Hope another version comes out on DVD because it deserves five stars.
014028009X|5.0|Bridget Jones's Diary was one of the most entertaining books I have read in a long time.  It may not be deep and philosophical, but it was enjoyable.  Every female cannot help but relate to Bridget in some manner.  I loved the book so much, I couldn't wait to see the film, though the book was much better.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Once again Stevie Has compiled an awsome record. I got the cd last night at 12:01 and sat there and was amazed, she still has it. Though it will take some time to see if it ranks better than her other hits, i can already tell though i have three or four favorits. Any true Stevie Fan will absolutely love it, like i did
B00005ATQM|5.0|I just received my Metallica DVD-Audio and listened to it in my Dolby Digital DVD player (not a DVD-Audio player).  The sound quality is so far beyond what is produced on CD in the same system.  I'm amazed at how well the different instruments are separated between the different speakers.  You close your eyes and think Metallica is playing right there in front of you.  I'm hearing things in the black album that I never knew were there. I'm going to have to listen to the CD side by side to see if I can pick up some of these new things I'm now hearing.<br />I highly recommend buying this Audio DVD.  It's excellent.  This is my first Audio DVD and I'm very impressed.  I can't wait to buy more of them.  The only problem is, now that I've heard the difference, everything else sounds so flat and bland.  And now I'm wishing I could get this sound quality in my truck.......maybe next year...<br />Brian
B000059ZLH|3.0|dream theater is one of the most talented bands around - with amazing concerts - i saw them twice for this tour (orlando, and tampa) - and as much as i love dream theater, this dvd does not  give the best representation of what this band is like.<br />their performance this night, is dead on - but there are problems - most of which are with the dvd.<br />1. jordan didnt do his giant solo - this was my only problem with the performance - at both the shows i saw, jordan went into a long solo during 'the dance of eternity', which he didnt do this particular night.  he most likely had a solo performance later on. which leads into....<br />2. the show was 2 separate sets, lasting 4 hours - but there are just under 3 hours i believe of concert footage. at first, i thought they just didnt put footage of songs they've already put on their other videos - but then during the documentary, they show footage of them playing 'the mirror' which is not on any of their other videos ('puppies on acid', the intro is on '5 years in a lifetime'.  asides from metropolis 2, the 'bonus footage' included only like 5 other songs - most of which are from 'a mind beside itself' from 'awake'<br />3. dolby 2.0 sound - c'mon.. this is a dvd! its in 2 channel stereo?! theres no reason for this.  im guessing kevin shirley, who mixed both the cd and the dvd possibly doesnt know how to mix 5.1, and they really wanted him to mix it because he mixed the original?  thats the only reason i could come up with.<br />4. the editing - &quot;ooh..look at the tacky backgrounds i can put behind the video&quot;.  portnoy even talks about backgrounds during the commentary as if he is proud of them.  i kept waiting for a star wipe.<br />that said...<br />the performance is awesome - and every dream theater fan should buy this. the performance gets 5 stars, but due to the issues i had with the dvd version of it, it loses 2 of those stars.<br />if you've never seen dream theater live - or if you just want to remember how awesome they are live - this is the dvd to buy.mber how awesome they are live - this is the dvd to buy.
0446310786|4.0|A compelling novel about the challanges we face everyday. Told through the eyes of a young girl, the novel explores many aspects of life from racism and prejudice to family morals. The protagonist, Scout, is taking in life like a sponge, bit by bit. Life is simple enough until her father agrees to represent an African-American man in a rape trial. He fights against the accuser Mayella Ewell, a white girl who is the daughter of the town's well-known, immoral family. Believe me-you CAN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN! A great novel I would really recommend to anyone!
B000002C25|4.0|Coming off the success of Definitely Maybe and What's the Story (Morning Glory)?, Oasis had a lot to live up to.  Be Here Now (1997) doesn't match the panache of the group's debut album, nor does it capture the complete glory of their sophomore effort.  However, to malign Be Here Now as an overblown piece of garbage would hardly be doing justice to an album that offers an outstanding mixture of good-time rock 'n roll and orchestra-laden ballads.  Few of Noel Gallagher's songs match the heartbreak of &quot;Don't Go Away,&quot; the love of &quot;Stand By Me,&quot; or the heights of &quot;All Around The World.&quot;  While some of the album's tracks can rightly be dismissed as self-indulgent throw-aways (&quot;Fade In-Out&quot; and &quot;My Big Mouth&quot; come to mind), it would be rash to dismiss the entire album.  Remember, hard rockers like the title track and &quot;D'You Know What I Mean?&quot; remind us why Alan White replaced Tony McCarroll's wind-up drumming.  Though it's likely not an album that anyone but fans would immediately warm up to, there are enough shining moments on Be Here Now to remind us why Oasis is the best thing to come out of Great Britain in a very long time.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|For the most part, anime movies and series have their own following, all willing to stake that &quot;their&quot; series is the penultimate of animation. However, few movies have made the impact that Akira has on American culture and its exposure to Japanese animation. Long before Pokemon and Gundam (Though Big O is a blessing in disguise on Toonami...) we got a taste of the full emotional range and power that could exist in a cartoon, and now we're getting it on DVD!   Incredible? Most definitely. Though-provoing? Absolutely.<br />Akira is simply incredible, and how Otomo managed to even attempt to fit the 2,000+ page manga into a movie is stunning. Anyone who doubts the impact this movies has made can simply ask the casual anime fan what the first movie they saw was. As for pop-culture? Check out the Powerpuff Girls! They did a great spoof on Tetsuo with the ugly sister episode, and it only goes to show how sincere the fan-base is out there.<br />To put it bluntly, if you haven't seen Akira, you need to. If you don't own it, you need to buy it! Being a college student myself, I know we're all not independently wealthy, but this is perhaps one of the best full-length animes ever created! (The manga isn't too shabby either...:P)
B0000524EM|4.0|Fans have not been able to see and hear THE CROW movies like this before (in the case of Salvation, this is its intro). The Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound &amp; DTS 5.1 Digital Surround Sound further enhance the impact on the senses (the movies are viewable in Widescreen 1.85:1 or full screen Enhanced 16x9). The picture is flawless and the soundtracks gloriously spring from the speakers with added power. The quality of the video and audio alone make owning the re-issue DVDs a must. <br />Miramax was forced to issue the first movie's DVD without Proyas' commentary, or any other supplementals that had his image, which include the advertised Schow 90min &quot;chronicles&quot;, a stills presentation taken from pics Schow took, and appx 6mins of the &quot;making of&quot; featurette that featured Proyas. An unfortunate circumstance for sure, but one that dealt with unknown agendas and legal issues not a thumbs down of the disk by Proyas as a previous reviewer has tried to insinuate. <br />The first movie's disk still contains plenty of supplementals to satisfy the fan pallet. The James O'Barr interview is a fantastic look inside the man who created this great story. Deleted scene montage &amp; extended scenes are fantastic looks into things that many fan chat sites have discussed and debated for years. A highly informative &quot;making of&quot; feature that was shot during production; original poster conception art, production design stills, and storyboards. And a highly informative commentary track by Jeff Most (producer) and co-script writer John Shirley . The extras don't stop there, in the DVDrom section there is a trivia game and a commentary playback feature that each in their own right tests the average fans knowledge of THE CROW while also giving us tons of never before seen or heard inside stories and trivia. The text commentary track is of special interest as it flashes information in regard to each scene while the movie plays, in some cases, allowing you to stop the movie to view pictures, more information or connect to the web. Also, the entire original shooting script can be read while you watch the movie. <br />The second movie's disk (The Crow: City of Angels), along with the sound and video enchancements mentioned above, has the best &quot;making of&quot; featurette of the 3 Crow movies. It is over 20mins and is a gem. Along with that, it has an extremely detailed Production &amp; Design featurette that is another great addition, original poster concepts &amp; production design stills (over 50). The commentary track is very informative and unlike the first movie's commentary track, contains most of the people involved in the movie. The DVDrom section has two priceless additions. The full original shoot script of the movie, never before seen by most fans and the complete Chet Williamson novel (which can be printed). Both can be read while the movie plays.<br />Salvation contains three &quot;making of&quot; featurettes, one focusing on the birds which is fantastic, production design featurette and commentary track that unlike the previous two movie's commentary tracks, has the total representation of the main actor/production persons. It is a highly informative track. The DVDrom section features the script. <br />The Crow disk has 11 supplementals, COA has 7 and Salvation has 6. More than enough quality supplementals to purchase these disks.
B00005ATQM|5.0|I have been a metallica fan for years now, so i naturally had to go get this DVD when it came out. I dont own a dvd audio player yet, but the 5.1 channel surround sounds great. I can only imagine the 6 channel sound. This is a must have for any true metallica fan. Rush to the store now and get it.
0780020685|5.0|Almost everyone would know the plot of this film.  The story of villagers being attacked by bandits and then hiring Samurai has been remade by Hollywood quite a few times (Magnificent Seven, Bugs Life). This however is the story at its best.  The performances in the film are great and Mifune can be quite humorous at times.  The film itself with a running time just under 4 hours goes by incredibly quickly.  I cannot praise this film enough.  If you haven't seen it then I recommend you do (In Japanese of course).<br />The picture on this DVD is quite adequate.  For a film that is over 50 years old I was quite impressed how clear the picture actually was.  It is presented in full-frame and is quite acceptable.  Well done to those that spent their time restoring this masterpiece.  The sound is Dolby Digital Mono and Japanese.  It is very clear, though don't expect any surround activity.  The subtitle stream is in white and doesn't conflict at all against the black and white picture.  The extras are limited with an interesting commentary track, though are better than nothing.<br />This DVD can be recommended on the film itself.  It is simply brilliant.  The characters and the story just doesn't get any better than this.  Well done again to the folks at Criterion for another fine presentation of a Kurosawa masterpiece.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game is one of the best books I have ever read. I was attached to the book like leach. The author, Orson Scott Card is an amazing sci-fi writer. In fact I envy this book's 1st time readers. His plot was ingenious! This author's detail is absolutely amazing. The story line Card followed was the most brilliant I've ever had experience with. He turned the old, want to save the world and become a hero plot into a story you never want to stop reading. I'll admit it, I don't read a lot of books. Most of the time I don't even read the books we are assigned to read in class. But this book is different, I actually wanted to read it. The only other book that could even come close to being judged on the same scale as this book would be a Redwall series book, which I also highly recommend. But if you want a book to enjoy, pick this one, i promise you, it will be worth it.
B000002JS6|5.0|This record (yes I bought it on vinyl in February 1981) changed my life.  Listening to this album is almost like a religous experience for me.  Before this my idea of rock'n'roll was Chipmunk Punk.  I had never heard anything like this (and neither had my parents) and still haven't.  Not a weak note on the album.  Who are these people who try to sound so highbrow by claiming that AC/DC's music is simplistic?  Some musicians even get on here and say things like &quot;they only play three basic chords.&quot;  Boy I'm sure glad they're here to explain these things to us.  As if any of it mattered.  How many albums have THEY sold?  Have they released an album?  Didn't think so.  There are much more &quot;talented&quot; or &quot;musical&quot; bands out there but they couldn't write a kickass song to save their lives. <br />Guitar Player magazine named this album the 5th best album of the 80's and I think their review of it said it better than I ever could.  Here is an edited version of the review, &quot;Back In Black, performed by the brothers Young is a terrifyingly brutal metal record, containing some of the heaviest guitar sounds ever committed to vinyl.  Songs like Hells Bells, You Shook Me All Night Long and the title track sound like they were performed by a pack of crazed wolverines touched by the hand of God.  You've heard of rhythm and blues? This is rhythm and bruise.&quot;  Nuff said.
B00005AXEL|4.0|&quot;I can't feel bad about the way I am,&quot; the oft-maligned Stevie Nicks sings early on on her new solo album. She should feel plenty good about this surprisingly strong album, made with the help of her pal Sheryl Crowe and songwriter/producer John Shanks. &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;  finds Nicks working with a mature growl that brings to mind a younger Marianne Faithfull; musically, it's a big-beat effort that feels like one of  Tom Petty's  better solo discs. Best of all, this doesn't feel like a career move. Those who fondly remember Nicks' pre-Mac work with Lindsey Buckingham should not hesitate to get this one.
B000002IJO|5.0|What a CD! Holy smoke, this sound is great! DU is mixed with the guitars much more in your face than the lates Ratt CDs...if you are a fan of DeMartini's you'll find riff aplenty here, those guitars really crunch! A great, solid album no filler here!
B00004XPP0|4.0|This here review only concerns the second episode. More about the third later. This second film of the trilogy is an in-between film. Several developments are elaborated in order to prepare the final episode. Luke gets into his training as a Jedi, but he interrupts it in order to go and help the Princess who is in a difficult situation : she is the prisoner of Vedar. His decision is unwise because he is not needed there and the Princess will manage to escape all by herself, and even worse, she will have to come back to save Luke himself. The confrontation between Luke and Vedar is dramatic because Luke is not prepared and he fails, losing one arm in the process, and what's more he discovers that the Dark Side of the Force is in the hands of his own father. He then becomes divided and that is the explanation of his defeat. But this prepares the next  episode. This second film reveals the love between the Princess and the mercenary she hired in the previous film. This love will be essential in the last episode because it is going to dictate the sequence of subsequent events. We are also revealed the project of Vedar who plans to get his own son on his side in order to get rid of the Emperor and become the sole master of the Empire and the whole galaxy. Temptation is great for Luke, though he manages to refuse. Even if this film does not have any real unity, it is an essential springboard for the last episode.

B000002IGP|4.0|the solo on She Wants Money has to be an all-time rock guitar standard-DeMartini at its very best. However, I find some of the songs to be a little too raw, Dancing Undercover really defined the Ratt'n roll sound of the '80s...
B00004XPP0|5.0|This here review only concerns the Return of the Jedi, the third episode, but it is teh crowning episode in most respects. The final episode, the happy ending after a lot of suspense, a masterpiece of creativity. The family gets reunited. The brother discovers his sister and vice versa. The son confronts his father and manages to bring the Jedi back out of the dark side which is definitely destroyed. The Emperor, the dark half of human nature, tha dark evil of humanity, the dark forces of the universe is brought to his end by the father who is thus regenerated and finally can take off his mask to look at his son with his real eyes. During that time, the sister and Solo, the ex-mercenary, destroy the shield of the death star and make friends with some primitive people on the planet. Those are so funny and so cute that they are lovable at first sight, looking like big living teddy-bears. But deeper than those plain events, it is the victory of the bright side over the dark side of things, the victory of the alliance of all the little Davids against the tyranny of the big Goliath. It is the victory of a joyful and happy society of individuals who love each other and love music, dancing and celebrations over an austere and sinister tyranny. The only mystery that survives at the end of the film, once the body of the father is burnt as some kind of religious homage, is why the sister is called a Princess, which is a reference to a monarchy and which builds a parallel with the Emperor of the dark side. She should be anything but a Princess. She should have no link with any non-democratic political system, she should have no link with any political system at all. She is pure life and happiness in a world of death and political tyranny. She is imagined Liberty and realized Freedom and conquered Peace. But well, we can do with this limitation.

B000002U9E|5.0|This is probably Kate's best album ever, or at least along with the Dreaming one of her best.  The first section is distinct from the latter tracks -- they are great songs and make use of the synthesizer in creative ways, a song like Cloudbusting demonstrates Kate's storytelling skill as songwriter and pop singer.  The second half (called the 9th wave) follows the stream of concious of a woman who's already been left bobbing out in the waves for a long time.  All the songs here are so unique unto themselves and yet when listen together take you on a singular journey.  I especially love how Kate uses traditional and folk music from all over the world and works them into the music -- for example Indian and Celtic music are found, as well as Latin monk chanting -- and also includes more modern sounds.  Running themes make their way through each of the songs and the result is a storyline with a rewarding climax.  I hope I have come close to describing how great I think this album is.  I really do think it should be required listening.
0792836634|5.0|this movie is cool.  I love this movie and all of the other childs play movies out there.  Kids should watch this, it makes them think twice about playing with dolls.  Go see this movie or even buy it.
B00000DQSS|5.0|I actually only bought this album fairly recently, but it has become one of my faves (or at least the cover art is).  These are just really great pop songs and classic Kate.  Also, this is the first that Kate produced and you can tell with the multiple layers and background voices in the music.  Much of the album is playful and fun -- like Violin, Delius, and Egypt -- and create a sort of fantasy world.  Heck, even a song about murder and suicide like The Wedding List is somehow made fun. Towards the end of the album the tone becomes more serious starting with Infant Kiss and ending in an amazing song about nuclear fallout -- Breathing.  This is a great album, one that I have to listen to straight through (sometimes several times in a row).
0790731002|1.0|Fans of 60s camp-Batman Adam West will love this film.  I loved that great old show too, but Burton set a new tone with the 1988 &quot;Batman&quot; film.  We all scoffed at Michael Keaton (Mr Mom as BATMAN?!?), but he turned out to be great, bringing to the character a much-needed darkness and severity.  Val Kilmer, a very good actor in his own right, can't live up to this; he's too...blond, maybe.  Just not dark enough.  And the star-studded cast of villains is also reminiscent of the earlier TV show.  In all, it's too many big names and special effects and not enough character development or script.  If you like the Dark Knight, avoid this clinker.

0451524985|5.0|Like many of us, I read this book in my late teens, but on a reread as an adult in my bookclub I realize the first time it probably went right over my head. Not because of the sex, which by today's standards is pretty tame, but for the astute observations on male and female behavior. I found Connie's ambivalence about her affair to be very believable--when with Mellors she's totally caught up in the moment, but away from him--even when pregnant with their child-- the real world intrudes and she feels ashamed. The description of the smart society of the 1920's and the casual sex was eerily modern. This book is about the conflict between nature and the industrial society, between pure sensuality and sex, between the intellectual life and the body. And parts of it are really funny!--the description of the meeting between Mellors and Connie's father is hysterical--the father is a complete buffoon. Lawrence has some odd ideas about sensuality and male power, and the brief, casual anti-Semitic throw away comments were disturbing, but all in all this was a great book.
0679736646|3.0|I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out my take on &quot;Ubik&quot;.  I enjoyed the speculation it offers, where the futures of the afterlife, corporate culture, and advertising are imagined in a very believable (and simply explained) way.  I also enjoyed the suspense and mystery elements it offers.  Someone has sabotaged Runciter Associates, the world's leading &quot;prudence organization&quot; (telepathic defenders against precognitive corporate raiders; don't trust my explanation, just know that Dick's is much more clear), and now they're slowly dying off.  But how, and why?  It is an interesting setup and the answer comes slowly and assuredly (except for the ending, which felt like an unnecessary tweaking of the tension, and logically made little sense).  These disparate elements were handled well.<br />The problem is that the elements don't add up to a cohesive whole.  Or rather, a cohesive whole that transcends the genre.  Science fiction, to me, should speak about grand issues on a grand scale.  The issues here were focussed on a very small group of people, and did not really speak to a larger community.  I don't feel threatened by a half-life menace, such as the one that stalks Joe Chip and his crew.  Although the idea of inertials, precogs, telepaths, etc. does hit close to home, the dystopian future Dick creates just didn't scare me enough.  And besides, the characters he creates are quite slight, nothing more than two-dimensional devices around which paranoia swirls.<br />Another problem is more a result of wasted opportunity, based on personal biases.  I truly enjoy works that explore the possibilities and perils of time travel (the second &quot;Back to the Future&quot; movie is my favourite of that series, and a fine example of the fun a warped space-time continuum can provide in a narrative context).  When the Runciter gang goes back in time (in a way), Dick only tangentially explores this phenomenon (e.g. Joe Chip discussing the outcome of WWII witha xenophobic pilot), and to me that's not enough.  Like I said, it's an opportunity wasted.<br />Dick does his best work here within the epigraphs that begin each chapter.  Set up as advertisements for the mysterious title-product, each is a parody of omnipotent cure-all consumer products.  But Dick also throws in a menacing warning line that the unfocused consumer wouldn't pick up on.  They provided the lion's share of laughs in the novel.
1563890410|5.0|Neil Gaiman's artistic exploration of sin and redemption in Sandman: Season of Mists is a wonderful example of the literary excellence that can be achieved with a graphic novel format. Gaiman blends traditional literary techniques, surreal art, and evocative storytelling in order to create a unique work of literature.<br />Sandman is a seventy-five issue comic book series which follows Morpheus, a divine being known also as Sandman, as he explores the dreams of humanity and deals with other divine creatures in order to better understand mankind. Season of Mists, the third story arc in the series, begins with the Sandman, Lord of Dreams, journeying into Hell in order to forgive a woman he condemned nearly ten thousand years ago. Things quickly become complicated, however, when Lucifer decides to resign as king of Hell, and leaves the Sandman with the key to his kingdom. As the story progresses, the Sandman finds himself debating what to do with an empty Hell, as well as contemplating what it would mean to forgive the woman he condemned.<br />Gaiman writes the above story in a poetic narrative that incorporates a variety of literary techniques. The divine beings the Sandman encounters speak in an almost musical pattern that uses a lot of alliteration, and one scene, in which the Sandman speaks to a group of historical writers, is even written completely in iambic pentameter. The style works extremely well, since it also serves as an allusion to the poetic works of Shakespeare (who even makes a brief appearance in the tale), Dante's Divine Comedy, and John Milton's poem Paradise Lost, all of which are classic literary works that explore similar themes of sin and redemption.<br />The majority of Gaiman's literary techniques, however, are incorporated into the story through the art. Most of the figurative language, such as metaphors, allusions, and imagery are made literal by the visible depictions of characters and locations. In one scene, all the divine beings the Sandman encounters are each drawn according to the art styles of the cultures from which they originate. In another scene, we see the horrors occurring at a boarding school for troubled boys. Flip back a few pages to the depiction of Hell, and the similarities between the two locations become clear. Most effective, however, is the scene in which Lucifer congratulates God on the beauty of a sunset. The painting which accompanies the statement conveys that beauty far more effectively than words ever could.<br />Neil Gaiman's Sandman: Season of Mists is a fantastical and intelligent tale that belongs in any literary collection.
B00005ASQ1|4.0|\\"Finding Forester\\" starts with a shot of a clapperboard, clearly showing director Gus Van Sant's name and the title of his movie.  Right away, the fact that this is a make-believe story is brought to the audience's attention.  Couple this with the liberal use of the song `Over the Rainbow' -- the most famous movie song about ideal, make-believe worlds  -- and I got the distinct impression that Van Sant was trying to make excuses for this maudlin, almost cliched narrative.  \\"Watch me undermine my own Hollywood film,\\" he appears to be saying.  \\"It may be trite, but at least I know that it's trite.  Forgive me, please.\\"<br />Whatever, Gus.  You protest too much.  I still liked your film.<br />The buzz on this movie is that it's nothing more than \\"Good Will Hunting II\\" (Van Sant recognizes this fact, with an obvious and unintentionally hilarious \\"GWH\\" reference in the film's epilogue).  I agree that it shares some cosmetic qualities with that film (bearded mentor counsels brilliant but troubled young man, against a background of poverty and academia), but \\"Forester\\" has enough unique qualities that the comparison becomes unnecessary.  First, the prodigy's genius is in his writing, and not in numbers.  It's a more dangerous proposition, because while most people wouldn't recognize a flawed mathematical equation, we can all spot bad writing.  Van Sant knows this, and tries to keep the examples of William Forester's and Jamal Wallace's writing hidden.  A wise move, because when we are finally exposed to them, it's quite dreadful.<br />While the narrative moved forward with powerful (and often contrived) thrust, the movie felt overlong.  I noticed many sequences composed of purely visual montages that felt overlong by half.  I think Van Sant could have used the services of a more judicious editor.  He seemed to fall in love with the images of New York's streets and its inhabitants.  That's fine for setting up the context of the story, but should have been abandoned once thestory got going.<br />The acting, overall, was a mixed bag.  F. Murray Abraham as the villain professor was way over-the-top.  Sure, he was menacing, but with no real substance to back it up.  Anna Paquin as the love interest showed considerable charm and eccentricity, but her role was little more than a device.  She's a two-dimensional character at best.  Busta Rhymes as Jamal's older and wiser brother, has charisma to burn.  But the man is not a good actor.  He's at his best in a scene at the dinner table, when he breaks out in a spontaneous rap about his job as a parking attendant.  In smaller parts, Michael Nouri (as a wealthy alumnus) and the man who played the basketball coach were both horrible and distracting.  Thankfully, these performances don't distract from the powerful leads. <br />Sean Connery is not a great actor.  He has not the depth and subtlety that the job requires.  But he is a star, and shows why here.  His William Forester chomps scenery as if it were saltines, dwarfing everyone around him.  And I could listen to Connery read the phone book, with that addictive Scottish accent of his.  He's perfect as the boozing J.D. Salinger-esque recluse, a man who can dominate a room by just raising one of his disheveled eyebrows.<br />Ron Brown is a revelation as the young prodigy who comes to Forester for guidance.  He is a perfect contrast to Connery.  He never tries to do too much, is always composed, coiled, contained, and charismatic.  And oh yeah: he's utterly believable.  I've heard it said that this young man, with gifts of genius on the basketball court and at the typewriter, was just too much to believe.  Well, I believed it.  And I give full credit to Brown, who's asked to carry the movie his first time out, and never drops the ball.

B000007MVX|4.0|Following the excellent &quot;Thick As A Brick&quot;, Jethro Tull released this extremely challenging disc. It will probably take me a million years to figure out the story completely, yet I know it has to do with death. I think that Ian Anderson wanted to get an outrageous reaction from his audience (I bet he and the guys got a big chuckle out of the whole ordeal),but as always, the music is excellent and complex, featuring rock/classical/folk/jazz all mixed together. And as always, it features some of that silly, &quot;British&quot;, humor, and not the least of it is that &quot;Hare&quot; story in the middle, which is the only flaw on the disc, but a minor flaw it is. <br />Overall, I enjoyed this as much as the other Tull cd's I own.<br />Thanks
0684833395|5.0|Most people claim this book is a &quot;war novel&quot;.  However, like Apocalypse Now, war is merely the setting.  This book is about life.  More importantly, the &quot;absurdity of life&quot; as someone has said.  After reading this book, I began to see through the &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; of society.  An excellent piece of literature.  You'll be better off for having read it.

6304057709|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen.  I'm not into classics at all since I find them boring, but this is a wonderful, wonderful movie.  It's been awhile since I've seen it, yet the memory of how much I enjoyed it stays with me.  Kate Winslet was nominated for an Academy Award here, and while I don't know the other contenders at the time, I think she gave the best performance of anyone else in this movie.  I'm a fan- of Kate's and this movie.
B000059QYB|5.0|Back in the '80s I wasn't really into Billy Idol's music. It wasn't until VH1's Behind the Music episode on Billy that made me gave Billy's music a chance. His greatest hits is a solid compilation of all his hits plus a killer cover of Simple Mind's &quot;Don't You [Forget About Me]&quot;. The live acoustic version of &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; is just amazing. It rocks out just as much as the studio version. &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; is probably my all-time favorite Billy Idol song. He has a snarl that just cannot be imitated. &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; is a awesome ballad while &quot;White Wedding&quot; brings back memories when music videos were actually entertaining. Even &quot;Mony Mony&quot; sounds good on this cd and that isn't one of my favorite songs from Billy. All his songs on this cd doesn't sound dated and actually sounds invigorating in this day and age of teen pop and rap/metal. This is one of the best greatest hits cds I have heard in a long time and usually there are a few tracks that I don't like but on Billy Idol's greatest hits, every track is a real winner.
6304383827|4.0|I think this is when Gwyneth Paltrow became big.  Maybe her first starring role?  Anyways, sometimes period pieces are hard to understand and follow, but this one moves along at a quick pace, and is suprisingly funny.  I say suprisingly because normally when you think comedy, a period piece isn't the first thing to pop to mind.  This movie has humor, drama, a great story, and most of all, Gwyneth Paltrow.  She shines here.  Toni Collete, another very good actress, has a humorous co-starring role here as the loveable frump that Emma (Gwyneth) tries desperately to help.  It all ends well, and I love a happy ending.  Don't you?
B000002UAU|5.0|I've read a few of the other reviews of this CD and want to know why people feel they must: A)Put Rubber Soul and Revolver above Sgt. Pepper, and B)Choose just one favorite Beatles album anyway.  As far as I'm concerned, all of the Beatles stuff from Ruber Soul   on is just majestic music.  (Help had its moments too).  Rubber Soul really started the Beatles' evolution.  Borrowing from Bob Dylan, their lyrics grew up, they wrote a much greater variety of types of songs, from anguished acoustic ballads to hard-driving rock.  This progression continued into Revolver, where they continued to diversify their song writing, and the influence of certain chemical stimulants starts to pop up.  Sgt. Pepper is the apex of their development, in my opinion.  They wrote the usual assortment of wonderful songs (my personal favorites are Lucy, Getting Better, Lovely Rita and Day in the Life), and they also became masters of production (with Sir George Martin's guidance).  They made sounds that hadn't been made before and it worked out marvellously.  Sgt. Pepper is a roller coaster of different sounds and visions, and I love every second of it. <br /> Now, if I absolutely HAD to choose a favorite album, I may still choose Rubber Soul, just because I enjoy the songs on that album a little bit more - they are beautiful, honest and heartfelt - but this album, with its fabulous production and progressive, artistic foundation, has a decided edge in the creativity department.  This album, along with Rubber Soul, Revolver, and the Magical Mystery Tour, are all at the top of my all-time list for rock albums.  Also of note is Pet Sounds, which was supposedly inspired by the near-perfection of Rubber Soul, and which in turn inspired Paul to create Sgt. Pepper in response.  You can hear a lot of Sgt. Pepper in Pet Sounds, but that is not a bad thing at all.  But I'll save my accolades of that album for its own review.
0780627024|1.0|So much hype and praise for this film.  I have no idea what all the fuss was about.  If there was some sort of socialogical statement being made, it was lost on me.  The story wasn't engaging, and the film on a whole, was weird.  Didn't go for it.
B000002UAR|5.0|The fact that I gave it 5 stars means that I still love this album, despite the review title.  I just think that this album is a little uneven in comparison to the releases that sandwich it in time.  yes, the Beatles are experimenting more here, and that's great, but the songs that result on Revolver aren't as cohesive or melodic as Rubber Soul or Pepper.  I'm a huge Beatles fan, but I'm not a member of the recent Pepper backlash.  I love some of Revolver's songs, but I don't love the album as a unit.  Eleanor Rigby is a little pretentious and I just don't like the chorus.  Good Day Sunshine is just boring and fruity.  I am not impressed by the melodies or production.  Same goes for Got to Get you Into My Life, but to a lesser degree.  And George's sitar song...the name is eluding me...is also pretentious and uninteresting.  The rest of the CD is transcendent, and it still more than earns its five stars.  <br />I just don't quite understand why this album has taken Pepper's place as the Beatles' definitive work, when there are a few forgettable songs here.  Rubber Soul is their most unified album, and Pepper, though it occasionally seems to lack direction, does not have the weak songs that pop up on Revolver.  Pepper also furthers the Beatles' experimentation and shows that they, teamed up with George Martin, became masters in the studio.

B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead, since their quasi-grunge Pablo Honey days, have striven to be one of those bands that evades any attempts by critics or fans to catagorize them.  The Bends saw them conquer fresh ground in music too layered and ethereal to be called &quot;rock&quot;.  OK Computer featured a band cutting and pasting rock and electronica together which resulted in a mind-blowing venture into the darkest reaches of globalism and technocracy; the album asks, &quot;Are we even human anymore?&quot;  A question teasingly half answered in &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and &quot;Slow Down,&quot; and flat out answered in the negative with &quot;Fitter Happier&quot;--which ended with the starkest submission that the individual is merely &quot;like a pig/in a cage/ on antibiotics.&quot;  <BR>  This is a band which had never opted for popularity at the expense of their art; their dilligence at songwriting, track laying, and lyric writing is evident in the fact that it often takes years before they are satisfied enough with a track to put it on an album.  Kid A represents the very height of commercial suicide.  They're almost daring those who loved OK to hate them, since only &quot;Optimistic&quot; even comes close to sounding anything like their previous album.  <BR> They are not only launching an endeavour into new territory, as someone else posted; rather, they are creating an entirely new, alien musicscape.  This is cut and paste mayhem, taking tracks of real instruments and feeding them into samplers.  &quot;Treefingers&quot; is, in fact, a myriad of guitar pieces put through a machine.  Brilliant.  &quot;Idioteque&quot; is a sullen parody of dance club escapism.  &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; is a dirge for the death of the heart and the soul in the digitized, globalized phantasm we call our existence--the new world (dis)order, where everything is put, as the first track says, uncertainly, &quot;in its right place&quot;; and, despite riots and the IMF, as Thom Yorke screams in &quot;The National Anthem&quot;, &quot;it's holding on.&quot;  <BR> Phenomonal.  I can't wait for Amnesiac!
B000056NX5|4.0|excellent rendition of the 70s classic.  i'm a fan of andrew lloyd webber so i'm glad to see this production since seeing them in new york would be hell on the budget.  All the acting was good, the singing was amazing well with the exception of judas, he was kinda half par...  besides that everything about the musical was wonderful. even kinda made me want to pick up a copy of &quot;the book&quot; and read it.

The scene where Superman is fighting the three evil supercriminals in downtown New York was intense!

B000087F5Z|5.0|After a few months delay, the long awaited Superman The Movie Deluxe Collection Box Set, from Creative Design Arts, is finally here. <br /> <br />The Movie: I was 10 years old when I first saw Superman during its original theatrical run. I remember going to see it at a neighborhood second run, 2 screen theater, in late August 1979. The movie has stayed with me ever since. It was the first film, I saw that helped me to choose a career path, into adulthood. Directed by Richard Donner, the film, has it all. The origin of The Man Of Steel has been told many times over the years in print and on screen. But few have had the size and scope of this film. The planet Krypton is doomed. In order for his infant son to survive, scientist Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sends him to Earth in a small starship. Once on our world, he is found and raised by Jonathan (Glenn Ford) and Martha Kent (Phylis Thaxter). As a teenager, young Clark Kent (Jeff East), soon discovers that he has \\"powers beyond those of mortal men\\". Once the adult Clark (Christopher Reeve) moves to the city of Metropolis, he lands a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet, and Superman soon reveals himself to the world. This as the diabolical Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) hatches a plot that means the death of millions. At its center, Reeve keeps things \\"real\\", and it's his performance as our hero that makes me \\"Believe A Man Can Fly, not the special effects. Donner takes nothing for granted in his direction. The film has some broadness to it, but it never gets out of hand, or gets too campy The movie has influence filmmakers. Most noteworthy, of course, is Spider-Man director Sam Raimi. Everything works and Superman The Movie still sets the standard for all other Super Hero films. <br /> <br />The Deluxe Box Set features the same DVD that's available separately, or as part of Superman movies DVD collection. The Director's cut includes a 2001 digital transfer of the film and 8 minutes of added footage (seen first on network TV).The film looks great. The sound mix was altered a bit but isn't as bad as some have suggested. The audio commentary by Donner and \\"Creative Consultant\\" (writer) Tom Mankiewicz is really very good. Get the real inside scoop on the making of the film with 3 documentaries and 1 featurette on casting. The commentary and documentaries give viewers a good idea what it must have been like to make the movie-including the story behind Donner being fired by the producers-while making Superman II. Other extras on this 2 sided disc also include a pair of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, a vintage TV spot, an isolated music only track of composer John Williams' rousing score, along with a few alternate music cues, and some DVD-ROM only material. <br /> <br />The box set also offers a collectable Senitype, with its corresponding film frame, a reprint of the original 20 page press campaign booklet, and a set of eight lobby card prints. Topping off the set is a 27x40 reprint of the original theatrical poster. The set comes with a folded poster that quite frankly, is a pretty silly idea, if you ask me. If you feel the same way I do, for a small shipping and handling fee, you can have a rolled version of the same poster sent to you that looks \\"Super\\" in a frame. <br /> <br />Superman The Movie is a classic that's been with me for a long time. Despite being made before the advent of CGI-the film holds up, and stands the test of time. The Deluxe Box Set is a must if you like the film as much as I do
6304698542|4.0|excellent musical! should have won an oscar... no wait it did.  anyway liza minelli and jole gray light up the screen with a seedy and seemy germany.  the story is dark and disturbing touching on antisemitism, and homosexuality.  but the score is absolutely amazing, drab and livly at the same time it really shows the termoils that were ripping germany apart.  and the film also shows how easy it was to be taken in by nazi retoric.  buy it rent it what ever just watch this movie!
0452282152|4.0|I hate to have to say this right off the bat, but this book is not a story about Vermeer.  It is the story of a maid in his house and her relationships and struggles with the new world she has been forced into. It is also not a fast paced shoot-em-up of a novel. This should be fairly obvious from the dust jacket, but apparently not, given some of the recent reviews this novel has received.<br />All ranting against the &quot;it didn't go boom&quot; crowd aside, this is an enjoyable and quick read about how Griet, a sixteen year old girl, forced through bad fortune to become a servant, survives and changes during her stay with the family of the famed painter Vermeer.<br />After Griet's father loses his eyesight in a kiln accident, she must become a servant in order to help her family survive.  She quickly finds herself thrown into a foreign world; she is beset with problems on all sides from an unfamiliar religion to a mistress who hates her, a master who demands much of her working time and energy and a patron who lusts after her. Her plight is best summed up by the words of the butcher's son:<br />  &quot;You're getting caught where you should not be, Griet...  Theirs is not your world.&quot;<br />As I said, this is a quick read and is highly enjoyable and well written.  The author, Chevalier, uses language beautifully and  paints a deft portrait of life in the 16th century herself.  It's an interesting story behind a famous painting.  Give it a try!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Does this album really need any more kudos? It's the benchmark live rock guitar album, the Gold Standard by which all others are judged. Although the tight pacing of the original &quot;Strangers&quot; release is confused a bit by this extended collector's release, it's a still hoot to hear the extra patter and live bits. Schenker/Mogg/Parker/Way, I tip my hat to you for this magnificent album with the wonderful Hipgnosis cover.
0618135871|4.0|i read an advance copy of this over the weekend...roth is certainly on a mission. he publishes every year now (thankfully), and continues to explore not how to get on Oprah's list, but how to illuminate the male psyche. Sex, death, all the usual new york jewish intellectual obsessions, but explored not for comedy but for true understanding. there's a scene here involving sex and menstral blood that perfectly encompasses all of roth's themes and obsessions. A short (but actually a perfect length for this story) work, but as captivating and fascinating as any of his longer books.
014100018X|4.0|Read this book if you're looking for a quick, light, and fun read. It has a wonderful whimsical setting, full of beautiful imagery and allusions.  It contains a touch of mystery, a dash of magic, some charming characters, a sharp wit, and the proverbial &quot;good vs. evil&quot; theme.  You'll end up rooting for Vianne, the protoganist, and wish you had her for a friend.  Don't read this book if you're looking for a deep insightful read - Chocolat, just like chocolate, is just a simple and delightful morsel to enjoy.
B000000W5N|5.0|My own personal pick for greatest R &amp; R album of all time, Sticky Fingers is an amazing piece of work.  Over time, Brown Sugar has become THE classic rock song, Sway is just plain evil (and powerful!), Wild Horses and Dead Flowers are &quot;Country&quot; Stones at their best, the guitar coda at the end of Can't You Hear Me Knocking still sizzles after hundreds of listenings, Sister Morphine is sung at the pace and in the tone of the near-dead addict - I could go on and on, but I'm just about a Moonlight Mile on down the road.  If you don't know what I'm singing at three o'clock in the morning, baby, I'm singing my song for you.  Powerful, powerful stuff...
B0000025RI|5.0|I got this album shortly after it came out and before it became a phenomenon, so listened to it without all the hype attached to its success. I didn't even see one video from it before buying it!! I actually heard &quot;Billy Jean&quot; on the radio, so bought it because of that song. And partly for the Paul McCartney duet, since I'm a Beatles freak. And, believe it or not, I remember being disappointed that &quot;Billy Jean&quot; wasn't as good as I remember hearing it on the radio! But I kept playing the album, and slowly learned to appreciate that it had a lot of other solid songs. I wasn't particularly a Michael Jackson fan, so was surprised at how much I came to like this album. It's good solid pop. It contains nothing of real depth--to compare him with the Beatles is ludicrous, and an insult to the Beatles. But for good solid pop, it's a very good album. Yeah, Michael has turned into a weirdo since, and his last album BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR sold amazingly few copies, considering his previous successes. I'm disturbed by Michael Jackson's character...but I can't deny he made good pop music.
B000003BEM|5.0|Just looking down the songlist of this neglected classic isenough to send chills down my spine... I mean, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but No Expectations, Jigsaw Puzzle, Factory Girl, Salt of the Earth... Listen for yourselves, people, and you be the judge - in my humble opinion, very few albums by anyone, anytime, measure up to this level of songwriting.  Beautiful, haunting, terrifying, rollicking, staggering...
B000055ZB8|5.0|Nosferatu is a cleverly photographed filmed, a cinematic masterpiece, but when set to the music that can be at times obnoxious (the Silent Orchestra or original score) it is yet more compelling and chilling. Could the scene of Count Orlok walking across the vessel be the greatest image in film? The audio essay and the bonus pre-production of art posters and sketches are really cool features.  My only drawback with this edition is the tinting, which makes the film choppy. But the film is too important and composed with such craft that you kind of forget about it in the end.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; is a masterful work of art.  I bought this CD upon listening/watching to the tune Alive on MTV and I was completely blown away.  It was one of those rare occasions when a recording totally engulfs and enables you to identify with every lyric wrote and note played.  <br />Unfortunately, I think that Pearl Jam's debut was the apex of their recording career.....which, is just fine because &quot;Ten&quot; is just that good.
B00004XONN|5.0|I had read some reviews about this CD. Many people say that you must listen to it a few times to really apreciate it. So, I went into my first listening with that expectation. It is a load of BS. After the first 2 tracks, I could not wait to hear the rest. An instant favorite album. In this day and age, popular music has grown repetative and unoriginal, for the most part. This is a novel album which breaks this trend. It is an important album and will be listened to an appreciated for decades to come. An original and beautiful work. <br />Buy it.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Not since Bella Donna has Stevie produced a full set of songs that fit together, yet have their own individuality as in the great line-up on &quot;Trouble In Shangri-la.&quot;  There's 13 smashes waiting to happen:  the title song starts slow, yet builds into a story that is full and rich; &quot;Sorcerer&quot; is the same Nicks composition that Marilyn Martin performed for the &quot;Streets Of Fire&quot; soundtrack, yet Stevie adds her own &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; vibe to this rendition; the new singles &quot;Planets Of The Universe&quot; and &quot;Everyday&quot; are racing up the charts and for good reason.  &quot;Planets&quot; is probably her most radio friendly hit since &quot;Rooms On Fire&quot; from twelve years ago.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is a smooth, heartfelt song sung in Stevie's deepest, huskier vocals to date.  &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; will touch anybody who has to say good-bye to their soulmate.  &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; was premiered on the Blockbuster Awards weeks ago and is a satisfying rock gem.  &quot;Love Changes&quot; is unlike anything Stevie has done and to good results, very contemporary.  So many songs and I'm running out of space!  This record is for fans, old and new...you won't be disappointed!
020161622X|5.0|There is nothing worse than sloppy code! You can dress sloppy, you can speak sloppy, you can live in a pig's sty, but please don't develop sloppy code for other's to take care of.<br />Read this book and follow the suggestions, and you will place yourself on the elite side of the bell curve with respect to your programming skills.
B00005AXEL|4.0|Well this sure sounds great to me.  It's always hard to coin how great an album will be at first, but this one might just be that for Stevie.  It sounds like the old Stevie/Fleetwood Mack, so those fans will probably like it.  Recommended to give a try.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Simple as that. The best film ever made or will ever be made.
0449227421|3.0|This has been my third Ken Follett book, and, in my opinion, the worst. Follett seems to have a knack for historical novels, like The Pillars of the Earth and a Place Called Freedom. But still, something irks me.<br />Why is it that in all of those books, the main characters are all identical phisically, and to some extent, mentally? Maybe Folleit just has a thing for dark, curly-haired women (Jeannie, Aliena, and Lizzie Hallim). It seems that for women to be considered successful they have to be logical, ruthless, and ravenously sensual. Men, with their fair hair and greenish eyes (Tom/Alfred Builder, Malachai McAsh, and Steve Logan) have to fall for the woman first, and somehow save them from a traumatic experience... Does anyoe else see a pattern in this?<br />Getting back to The Third Twin, this would make a reasonable movie, but somehow it was lacking in personable warmth. I agree with one of the previous reveiwers, it was good, it seems, up to the point of the &quot;perfect soldier&quot;, and the whole Pentagon thing I just skipped entirely.  <br />I'm not saying this was a bad book, but then again, is any book truly bad?
B000002O7C|5.0|This soundtrack made the movie so much more dramatic. Especially in Red Route One when they weave the canyons. And of course when they battle with the Akula in the end. A MUST BUY
B00005B6C9|5.0|&quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; is a very retrospective turn for the band.  For the first time since the &quot;Disco Danny Days&quot; of the mid to late 70's, this album (though definitely R&amp;B in spots) features no discoesque falsetto (or disco at all for that matter) which is rather ironic (and gutsy for the brothers) since 'discoesque dance music' is so trendy now.  <br />Who could better encapsulate a 35-year career with all-new music retrospetive of the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s and package it to sell to a contemporary audience?  No one, that's who!  It's almost impossible for me to pick specific songs from the album.  They are ALL good.  However, I am most moved by Man In The Middle, Deja vu, Technicolor Dreams and The Extra Mile.   This Is Where I Came In (like Still Waters, four years ago) is much more like Bee Gees music from the late 60s and early 70s (Beatlesque in style).  The melodies are rich and beautiful, the harmonies (as always) impeccable and the band (which are all long-term Bee Gees band members) has never sounded better.  <br />The style of each song differs from what comes before or after it.  The album is well produced and is a rich blending of rock, R&amp;B and balladry with hints of early Bee Gees 60s-style psychedelic sounds running through it.  For example, &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot; has the feel of &quot;Turn of The Century&quot; or &quot;New York Mining Disaster, 1941&quot; (Better remembered as &quot;Have You Seen My Wife, Mr Jones?&quot; which were songs released on their first international album (Bee Gees 1st,1967).  <br />And though much of the music has a Lennon/McCartney feel to it (as it did in the late 60s), it's, as always, '100% Gibb'.<br />  My life-long friend, who has never cared for The Bee Gees before, listened to the whole CD thinking it was The Moody Blues.  When she mentioned how good the album is, she asked me who the singer of a particular song is (in reference to the song Man In The Middle).  When I said &quot;Maurice, the guy who plays keyboards and guitar&quot; she then asked if he is the one who does the poetry section of &quot;Nights In White Satin&quot;.  Realizing that she thought the band was the Moodies, I said &quot;Darlin', this is Bee Gees, not Moodies&quot;.  She immediately went off!  &quot;THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS is The Bee Gees?&quot;  &quot;Now you have ME liking Bee Gees?&quot; she said?  The album is truly *that* good.  As a lifer Bee Gees fan, I found her amazement somewhat amusing, since the music is really not all that different than what they have done previously.  That's also what makes this album so incredible.<br />I cannot praise it enough!  Incredible job guys.  Thank you from a true, lifer fan! I knew you would do it, again and again!
B0000048CX|5.0|While most of Yo La Tengo's studio records have been filled with solid indie rock and droning noise pop, this record is all covers, most by obscure artists, and captures some of the elements that have made this Hoboken, NJ, band so special for decades.<br />Yo La Tengo has always peppered its live shows and lesser-known releases with a mix of covers - some expected and some unexpected - and their annual broadcast on WFMU radio in Jersey City, NJ where they will play any song requested by the call-in audience on the air have all earned them the title of &quot;the world's greatest cover band.&quot;<br />Every song on this disc is pure pop genius as interpreted by Yo La Tengo.  Play The Scene is Now's &quot;Yellow Sarong&quot; and Daniel Johnston's &quot;Speeding Motorcycle,&quot; a few times and you'll be hooked (although all songs on this record are awesome).
B00004X01U|3.0|I am a true blue Madonna fan.  I know every word to all of her songs, and would cut off my right pinky to meet her.  In fact, it is almost like pulling teeth for me to give any of her efforts anything less than four stars.  However, I'm going to do it now.  Perhaps I'm not in love with this CD because I'm not hip to the electronica bippety boppety hippety house groovy acid jazz scene.  I guess my tastes in music does not allow me to be one of the industry's elite.  Yet, I know what I like and I know what I love.  I like, but do not love this cd.  The clear standout track on MUSIC is the often-played (and deservedly so) &quot;Don't Tell Me.&quot;  The cowboy sound intertwined in this track appeal to my Texan heart.  However, the rest of the album never really emotionally effects me.  Don't get me wrong.  I like just about every song on the CD.  Yet, I do not feel the need to play it every time I sit in my car or sit around my house.<br />Enough justification for the three stars.  What do I like about this album? I like some of the risks she and her producer take.  Take for example, &quot;Impressive Instant.&quot;  There are not many songs in the music scene out there that have this sound.  In a day and age where so much music sounds alike, it is truly refreshing to have a dance song that breaks the mold the way this track does.  I am utterly astounded that the bars have not been rampantly playing this song continuously.  I bet in a few weeks they will have to start.  Also, look to &quot;Paradise&quot; for a different and well executed sound.<br />I also appreciate the idea behind &quot;What it Feels Like for a Girl.&quot;  It is a track that will immediately stick out on your first spin of the CD, but, unfortunately, looses a lot of its edge after the third listen.  It is in tracks like these that I wish Madonna and her producer would have realised their FULL potential instead of stopping halfway.  Of course it's good, but with somebody as talented, and with such a profoundly amazing track record, I expect it to blow me through the roof.<br />Further, I wish the lyrics were a bit more crafted.  Lyrics like &quot;It doesn't pay to be a runaway lover&quot; or &quot;Nobody's perfect/I'm doing my best&quot; don't really make a lasting impact on my impressionable ears.  <br />In the end, I still love Madonna more than cigarettes and silk blankets, but I am hardly blown away by this CD.  Yet, I understand the absolute necessity to purchase any of her efforts-- and this effort is well worth it--- for at least a few weeks anyway.
6305399212|5.0|I'm a big fan of Special Editions. I love the new features and all the bells and whistles that come on the DVDs and VHS tapes. Being able to learn more about my favorite movies makes the purchase of the film for a second time (in the case of &quot;Army of Darkness,&quot; a third as well) well worth it. The Special Edition for James Cameron's masterpiece of outer space terror, &quot;Aliens,&quot; is definitely worth the money. It has the definitive Special Edition touch: Scenes that were once deleted that have been seamlessly re-entered into the film's running time. All of the scenes restored here by Cameron actually prove to be vital in understanding the characters more, as well as getting a glimpse of the true relentless savagry of the xenomorphs.<br />After the disaster aboard the Nostromo in &quot;Alien,&quot; Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the only survivor... along with her tiger-stripe cat, Jones. Now, after 57 years in cryosleep, Ripley wakes up to nightmares, court martial, and the possibility of the resurgence of the alien intelligence she single-handedly fought and won against 57 year prior. She won't go back to that planet, she tells the slippery Carter Burke (Paul Reiser). &quot;I said no, and I mean it. Now please leave. I am not going back and I would not be any good to you if I did.&quot; But a nightmare in the middle of a sound sleep jogs her decision and she is off with the Marines on the spaceship Sulaco to planet LV-426. The colonists on the planet have totally vanished, the complex is empty with the exception of one little girl (Carrie Henn), and the aliens are lurking about in the dark.<br />You guess what happens next, and this, as the tagline to &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot; says, is where you can &quot;kiss your nerves goodbye.&quot; After we've gotten to know the characters, who are all likable in their own way, except Burke, of course, that slimy criminal..., Cameron launches us into an all-out battle of human versus alien. They come out of the walls, they bust up through floor panels, they drop from the ceiling, they take bullet after bullet, and until their heads explode from too much, they keep coming until you are either cocooned for the Hive Queen, or you are dead. Those two options don't leave much in the way of pleading for mercy. And &quot;Aliens&quot; is merciless: It's like riding on the fastest roller coaster you can find with the world's biggest drops, longest tunnels, steepest hills, sharpest turns, and it doesn't stop for two hours. James Cameron was a relatively inexperienced director when he made &quot;Aliens,&quot; but he has delivered. &quot;Aliens&quot; is fantastic entertainment.the walls, they bust up through floor panels, they drop from the ceiling, they take bullet after bullet, and until their heads explode from too much, they keep coming until you are either cocooned for the Hive Queen, or you are dead.

B000001FA4|3.0|Brian Eno coming to produce U2's albums was certainly a landmark decision, and eventually evolved U2 into the best band in the world.  On &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, a few tracks are TOO inspired by the ambient-genre mastermind.<br />The best songs on this album are some of the best songs U2 have ever created.  'Pride' is the most up-beat of all the songs, a huge stadium anthem that really put U2 on the map.  'Bad', however, is better, in my opinion.  Bono sings so passionately, screaming &quot;I'M WIDE AWAKE!&quot; to his friends lost in the world of heroin.  This song is miraculous, with the Edge's beautiful riff, Larry Mullen's soft but powerful percussions, and Bono's jaw-dropping vocals.  'Wire' is a fast-paced rocker that really shows some impressive musicals by Edge.  'A Sort of Homecoming' is a subtle but powerful song about coming home again (hence the title).  'The Unforgettable Fire' is a good song, and one of the best examples of U2's sonic landscaping (only '4th of July' is more ambient).<br />A nearly great song is 'Promenade', but its mere 2:30 minutes stop it from being better than it is.  Nevertheless, I love this song.  Edge's guitar is very moody and sonic, and I'm not sure what Bono is singing about too much, but he sings it with a fascination like a curious boy (you'll have to hear it).  It could have been a great song if it were a little longer.  'Indian Summer Sky' is somehow barely mentioned, and that's because it's neither inspiring or dumb.  It's simply luke warm.  And there's not too much more to say about that.<br />Now the bad songs.  '4th of July' starts out interesting, and it's very ambient and sonic, however, the same guitar riff is played throughout the ENTIRE SONG.  'MLK' sounds like the beginning of the later released 'Where the Streets Have No Name', and you realize it's an ode to Martin Luther King., Jr., but it sounds more like a lullaby than a dedication &quot;Sleep... sleep tonight... and may your dreams be realized.&quot;  Oh, and the biggie.  'Elvis Presley and America' may be the single worst track that U2 has EVER produced.  The nearly monotone vocals and repetitive riff (if you can call it that) drag on for a painful 6 minutes.  And it even starts out quite disturbing: &quot;Buring black flesh&quot;?  Eww!  This song it horrendously terrible.<br />This album is well worth getting for the tracks 'Pride', 'Bad', and 'The Unforgettable Fire'.  The rest of the album you'll have to decide for yourself.
B00005AXEL|5.0|The title track as well as the album name, Trouble In Shangri-La means trouble in Paradise.  There's no trouble on this CD.  I found Everyday to be uplifting.  Planets of the Universe and Fall From Grace are energetic songs, that make you want to get up and dance.  Sorceror and Love Changes are a bit different, kind of jazzy, but otherwise great tunes.  Some songs are slower ballads like That Made Me Stronger and I Miss You evoke emotional feeling and thought.  In conclusion, this record is a must for Stevie Nicks fans, and anyone else who enjoys music that is written by the artist and not by the record companies.
B00000880Y|5.0|This is a combination of the American Epic label's SUNSHINE SUPERMAN and MELLOW YELLOW which was released in England in either 1967 or 68. Donovan had some record company glitches which prevented his first two Epic releases from getting to the British public until late. This compilation is the result. Great cover, but not the conceptually realized work the artist originally intended.

Flying with me is HAL, a super-computer that is hiding something from me.  She tried to destroy me but she did not exceed.  I think that I might have to shut her down.  As I peer out into space I feel the loneliness swwep into me.  If you like fantasy books that are thrilling and have a twist ending then you should read 2001 A Space Odyssey.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|WOW! back in the summer of 1996, i heard about this movie so much that i decided to rent it. after that, i was amazed and outstanded by it and bought it. The Story deals with futuristic Tokyo, a Biker named Tetsuo gets hurt in a Accident and is being the subject of a experiment in giving him mental powers called &quot; Akira&quot;, suddenly he goes on this rampage through The city in search of &quot; Akira&quot; with his Telekinetic-Telpathic powers. Really Awesome, Amazing and one of the best animated films i've ever seen in my entire life, it's sure gotten acclaim and a cult following ever since it's theatrical release in the US in 1988. It's a Must See or Must Own for Anime fans.<br />recommendations: Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, Heavy Metal, Total Recall, Evil Dead, Ninja Scroll, Professional: Golgo 13, American Pop, Rock and Rule, Fist of the North Star, Spawn ( animated), The Matrix, Transformers: The Movie, The Fifth Element, Mad Max, Scanners, Carrie, Firestarter, The Sixth Sense, A clockwork Orange, and The Shining.
B00005JG6R|5.0|Akira is by far the greatest anime I've ever seen!<br />The story is based in the post-apocolyptic future (21st century).  The human races' population has been been dramatically reduced, but it is by no means extinct.  The remaining population is plagued by rival street gangs, a constant military presense, and corrupt politicians.  <br />In this future, an extremely powerful psychic force, known throughout the movie as &quot;Akira&quot;, has been kept under tight reign by the military.  It wasn't completely clear to me, but I beleive that the manifestation of Akira in children and young adults was a result of the military experimenting on gifted human minds to create an all-powerful military fighter.  The initial experiments resulted in disaster.  <br />Early on in the movie, the main character of the story, Tetsuo, a young teen-aged biker, is &quot;found&quot; by the experimentation team.  He is put through the testing and Akira grows in him.  It proves to be too much for him to handle, and he quite simply goes mad from the power... and I do mean crazy-mad!  His meta-physical and telekinetic powers grow to unimaginable levels.  At one point in the movie while in the military hospital, he get's out of bed with a terrible headache and is beginning to go mad.  As he's walking towards his steel bedroom door, it splinters and shreds from it's hinges.  He stubles down the hall a little ways and a group of gaurds tries to subdue him.  This of course pisses him off, and in a fit of anger he wills a spherical force into existence expanding around himself, which just totally sends shredded pieces of the soldiers all over the corridor.<br />...That's pretty early on, and only a SMALL example of the things that happen in this movie.  I'll leave it at that.<br />If it truely helps you to decide whether or not this movie is worth buying, I can tell you that since seeing this one, I find myself comparing every other anime to it, and feeling let down that there have been no othersthat come close to being as good as Akira.  The animation is simply the best!  Clean, clear, smooth, and most importantly, EXTREMELY DETAILED!  I swear, not only were the animators and drawers of this movie extremely gifted, but they were also extremely meticulous about every little thing.  You've got to see it to believe it!<br />One warning:  This movie can be VERY graphic at times (visually, not sexually).

Some BEE GEES fans may not like it, but not having ever been one, this is a truly awesome sound!
B00004SCX6|1.0|While a lot of people feel it's relevant to discuss whether or not Britney has implants or uses her body to further her career, the bottom line is:  SHE CAN'T SING!  All the twelve-year-olds who feel that everyone who &quot;denies Britney's talent&quot; is jealous of her looks or fame are obviously just trying to defend their idol, regardless of what kind of music she puts out.  Song after song on this album is repetitive and shallow garbage that was masterminded by people who have long left their teen years behind.  I won't knock the girl for her sole attempt at writing a song, but how she even got a record contract is beyond me.  If you want to hear the horrendous voice for yourself, my suggestion is to download a few songs (from either album, since they both sound the same) for a taste before making up your mind on whether or not you can actually tolerate listening to a full CD.
B000002HRE|5.0|Quit complaining about the fact that this cd is slower than the others.  What was you expecting? The Metallica of the late '80's?  Any good rock group changes with the times.  All of the songs on this cd kick major a$$.  Only one Cd could ever top this one and it is the Black Album, and might i add that the Black Album is what got me into Metallica, so if a Metallica cd comes along that ranks up there with The Black Album then it must be a great cd.  For those illeterate people who don't know what the Black Album is, it is their self-titled album Metallica.
0471043729|5.0|The 1st edition (the 1980 version) was the gold standard of electrochemistry books, and the authors have done an excellent job of revision for the 2001 2nd edition. In particular, the sections on impedance and modern pulse methods flow nicely. The spectroscopy section has been updated as well. I have not worked many problems, but they seem useful in elucidating concepts. The mathematics is of a higher order than one expects from electrochemistry, showing the impact of kinetics on electrode processes nicely. I recommend this text for electrochemistry courses highly.
044100590X|5.0|I have not finished the novel yet but I wish to do so very soon. Dune is a very good novel that I started reading for an english project I did not think I would like the novel but once I started reading it I started to like it a lot. The novel is very long and I did not think I would get done with it but once I started to read it I really started liking it and could not stop reading it. The novel has a lot of science fiction in it and I usually do not read science fiction novels but I thought I would give it a try and I am glad that I did. The planet arrakis sounds like it would be a good place to live but I am not sure if I would want to live there because of some of the stuff that happens. After I get done with this novel I may read some other novels by Frank Herbert because I am starting to like his work and he seems like a good author. If there is one novel that everyone should read it would have to be Frank Herberts Dune due to the great writing style and how interesting this novel is .
B000001IQH|5.0|every now and than a band will make an album that is not just good from start to finish,but downright amazing.this is one of those albums.the opening teack,&quot;maxwell murder&quot; is the greatest opening song ever,as it flys by only slowed down so matt freeman can unleash a crazy bass solo on you.&quot;roots radicals&quot; is a song that you will jump around to even if you are all alone in the house.&quot;time bomb&quot; has incredible bounce to hit,while &quot;olympia wa.&quot; and &quot;journey to the end of the east bay&quot; have so much heart and soul its hard to resist going back to them again and again.this masterpiece closes off with one of the all time greatest anthems to being an outsider, &quot;the way i feel&quot;.it seems that all rancid songs are anthems of one kind or another,and this record is just brimming with them.the sound is perfectly suited to the hard but melodic tunes,tough drums,buzzy guitars and a bass that stands out like no other.than there are the lyrics,as you would expect they are honest,heartfelt and passionite.rancid is known for energy,and this album captures it like a photo.
B00004YW6I|5.0|pj harvey is awesome!!!  this cd is now #1 on my list!  just saw her last night with U2 in Minneapolis, MN and she absolutely rocked the house!  i'd highly recommend this cd to anyone even remotely interested!
B00005AXEL|2.0|Stevie Nicks was once a truly great artist. The songs she made with Fleetwood Mac and as a duo with former beau Lindsey Buckingham are timeless and beautiful. Her solo debut, Bella Donna, was nothing short of a masterpiece. But the solo releases that followed have fallen progressively short of the greatness of her past. Trouble In Shangri La is no exception, and to my mind is some of her worst material to date.   The music on this album is bland and without beauty or true emotion. It has a very artificial feel to it that is anything but a pleasure to the ears. Her attempt to reinvigorate her sound with the input of such new artists as Macy Gray and Natalie Maines has proven futile. Worst of all is the greatly deteriorated sound of Stevie's voice. It has become nasal, and as the years have progressed it has sounded more and more like that of Stevie's mentor Tom Petty. All of this comes as a real shame, because Stevie's talent as a lyricist has remained and the words still hold the emotion and beauty that the music and vocals lack. But even such great poetry is not enough to make this album worth while.
B00003CXMG|1.0|Almost Famous... &quot;almost&quot; a decent movie, too bad it was so boring and had little excitement. The movie just was a consistant theme of &quot;blah, bad music and drugs&quot;. Check it out and see how bad the movie really is.
B00005ASOC|3.0|This movie has its heart in the right place and respects the mind. It's also formulaic to an excessive degree. Sean Connery is to be commended for playing against type, but is just not believable as an agoraphobic. He's SEAN CONNERY, and there ain't nothing nobody can do about that: hale and sexy and throbbing with life. Rob Brown is a find. Natural, effortless, and right. Gus Van Sant seems to be slumming with hackneyed material like this, but brings a respectable professionalism to the project. I'd rather see the innovation he brought to his first films, but I guess everyone deserves to make as good a living as they can. And again, this movie rarely insults our intelligence, except in the execrable writing associated with F. Murray Abraham's character.

B0000046X0|4.0|The two US jazz-rock groups who were massive here in the UK in the 1970s were Weather Report and Return to Forever.  Instrumentally the only difference was that the former had a saxophonist where the latter had a guitarist, but the overall sound of the two bands seemed worlds apart.  From 'Hymn of the 7th' up to 'Romantic Warrior', RtF were more rock than jazz, and I guess the stepping stone for many disgruntled Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer fans -- the similarity is closest with 'Romantic Warrior'.<br />Is this a Corea or an RtF album?  The CD itself and the spine of the CD box says it's a Corea album, but that's highly unfair on the rest of the virtuoso musicians here.<br />Recorded in August '73, 'Hymn of the 7th' marks the last group album that Corea made without synths.  By the time of the next LP ('Where have I know you'), recorded Jul-Aug '74, Corea was festooned with all sorts of Yamaha kit, and his subsequent albums didn't always benefit from the sponsorship.  Here Corea has nothing more sophisticated than an electric piano.  The only misjudgment on the instrument front is Stan Clarke's venture onto the fuzz bass for one or two tracks.  But I suppose innovation means you've gotta try these things.<br />Remastered by Joseph Palmaccio (I hadn't heard of him before), this album has come out clearer if anything than 'Where have I known you'.<br />As a teenager I used not to like this album as much of the subsequent albums, simply because this didn't have Al DiMeola on it, and Al was THE man.  But listening to it again now rather more objectively, it's clear that Bill Connors was just as good a guitarist, but he got a different tone out of his instrument.

B00004XONN|2.0|I'm giving Kid A just two stars because most of the praise regarding this album refers to its so-called originality.  Maybe for most people who listen to nothing but mainstream music (i'm not making a judgment, just stating an observation) this is original, however, if you have ever listened to Aphex Twin, Haujobb, Delerium, Autechre, Orbital, DJ? Acucrack, THD, etc., it's obvious that none of Kid A is original and quite frankly, it's been done better.       That's not to say that this is a completely terrible album, however, i feel that this is probably one of the most overrated albums ever and bands that have already made (better) music similar to this are getting seriously screwed over (but that's usually how the music industry works).
6304602898|5.0|Gremlins, the wonderful classic. The best horror/comedy around. I recommend this movie to everyone. These funny little guys attack everyone in town and have a great time while doing it. I'm sure you'll enjoy watching them tear the town apart too! Check it out, highly recommended to all!
6304873441|1.0|Fox has mangled the story of Anastasia, and turned it into some stupid piece of garbage. First of all, Anastasia was NOT a princess because her father wasn't a king, he was an emperor. Second of all is the fact that Anastasia was by no means skinny. She was plump and chubby. But oh god forbid we can simply cannot have a heroine who's figure is less than perfect. Also, I think the real Rasputin looked a lot scarier than the movie's. Anastasia did not live happily ever after, she was brutally murdered. What disgusts me is that all of the animated movies have happy endings. Um, hello! Not all stories have happy endings! Look at Romeo and Juliet! It had a sad ending, but it's still one of Shakespeare's most famous and popular plays. All these dumb happy endings are getting on my nerves. Plus they are actually more harmful. They can make kids think that all stories end happily ever after and they don't. Don't waste your money of this crap. It's obvious Don Bluth didn't even think of cracking a book or doing any research. The story of the actual Anastasia is way better than this movie could ever dream to be.

B00005AXEL|5.0|Nicks had never sounded stronger or more confident. Her vocalizations are pure, her lyrics honest, raw and very real. It's nearly impossible to pick a favorite on this cd....maybe in time. But for now they all shine, most especially the title track and &quot;I Miss You&quot;, tho' &quot;Everyday&quot; gave me chills the first time I heard it. Expect this cd to be a MONSTER in it's sales and praise and for the beautiful and lovely Miss Stevie Nicks to be showered with much deserved awards and accolades. They're long over due......
B000002518|4.0|Bob Dylan made his acting debut as Alias in Sam Peckenpaugh's Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid.  In addition to acting, Mr. Dylan provided the songs for the soundtrack.  In fact, its one song from the soundtrack that has become infinitely more famous than the movie itself.  The song is one of the all-time best from a man who many consider the voice of a generation.  The song is of course &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door&quot; and its power is undeniable.  The song conveys the fears and confusion of both men of good (Pat Garrett) and bad (Billy The Kid) and it shows that no matter how you live your life, the specter and fear of death creeps into us all.  There are some decent instrumentals and four versions of the song &quot;Billy&quot; which are good, but the album is really carried by one song.
B000059Z8J|3.0|I was so hoping that this was going to magically transport me back to 1978 the same way the recent SE CD soundtrack release did.  I guess I should've known better, but somehow I hoped against hope that this long, long, long, LONG anticipated DVD was going to be my beloved KCOP version of Superman finally put to digital.  Sadly, we are only thrown two bones (the extra Jor-El scene in the Fortress and the Gauntlet of Doom).  While it is absolutely incredible to finally have the Gauntlet of Doom restored and included in all it's greatness, there is SOOOOOO much more that really should've been included.  Some of the exclusions I can understand, but how on Earth can they justify not including the scene of Superman swooping out of the sky and into the path of the XK-101 (only to have the rocket GO AROUND HIM)?  IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SEQUENCES IN THE WHOLE FILM!!  For those unaware, in the early '80's a California TV station (KCOP) showed ONE TIME ONLY the fabled &quot;Ultimate&quot; Superman the movie with all intact usable footage restored and included.  The scene I refer to takes place just after Superman explodes out of Luthor's lair and pursues the rocket.  In this DVD, the next time we see Superman he flies over the heads of some guys in the desert repairing a fence, chasing the first rocket, but in the UNCUT version he is seen in an amazing effects shot gliding majestically into the path of the rocket where he braces himself for the impact.  However, the rocket is specially equipped to detect obstacles and simply goes around him.  Superman looks shocked for a moment, then tears off in pursuit.  THEN the scene picks up with the fence-repairmen.   This is just one small, but IMPORTANT example of the omissions.  Also, I had the distinct feeling that the soundtrack was heavily edited.  It turns out that I don't think it is, it's just that the KCOP version makes absolutely the fullest use of John Williams' full score.  And what's with the altered sound effects?  I've no problem with audio-enhancement (ala the recent re-release of the Beatles' Yellow Submarine), but they outright CHANGED many sounds in the film!!  Remember the cool &quot;zzzzrrrrrmmmm&quot; sound as young Clark hurles the green crystal off into the distance?  It's GONE!  Replaced with another sound that I guess they thought was more impressive or something.  I dunno, maybe it's me.  I'm a purist.  I didn't care too much for the Star Wars &quot;Special Edition&quot; changes either.   Okay, the POSITIVE now.  The DVD IS worth the money, though.  Why, you ask, after I just &quot;ripped&quot; it?  Simple---EXTRAS!  Tons and tons of extras!!  You can spend nearly as long watching and reading the amazing and enthralling extras as the film itself.  Several very informative documentaries.  I was impressed!  And even modern-day interviews with the cast, including Chris Reeve.   BOTTOM LINE--buy the DVD for the extras (and ONLY for the extras!), but give yourself the real treat by obtaining the KCOP version!
B00000J7SO|3.0|One thing you can say about Bob Dylan, is that he is courageous enough to mix things up.  Whether it be going electric, playing country or playing Christian rock, he follows his own muse.  On Street Legal, he tries his hand at a lavish, slickly produced, almost pop album.  The album employs alot of horns, background singers and sounds in some places like Mr. Dylan was aiming for a career as a Vegas act.  But that being said, when this album works, it hit some very high notes such as &quot;Senor&quot;, &quot;Where Are You Tonight&quot; and &quot;Changing Of The Guard&quot;.  But the failures are equally low such as &quot;Baby, stop Crying&quot;, &quot;New Pony&quot; and &quot;No Time To Think&quot;.  Street Legal is worth a listen for its unusual sound.
B00004YYWI|5.0|This album is beautiful :)<br />The bonus-track might not be the best, but it is fun to listen to. All in all, this is an extremely great album. Go get it =)
B00000255X|5.0|Bob Dylan followed up his magnificent Blood On The Tracks with another great album in Desire.  While not quite up to the level of its predecessor, Desire contains some sharp writing and some interesting sounds.  The album opens with &quot;The Hurricane&quot; which is the famous song about the plight of boxer Ruben &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter.  The song's theme takes him back to his early protest days and with its condemning indictments, he shows he can still skewer the establishment with his biting commentary.  In addition to the lyrics the use of Scarlett Rivera's violin provides the songs with an additional edge as Ms. Rivera cuts through the song like a knife.  &quot;Isis&quot; is an interesting and mystical song that sounds different from his usual work.  &quot;Mozambique&quot;, &quot;Romance In Durango&quot; and &quot;Black Diamond Bay are all strong tracks as well.  The album closes with an ode to his ex-wife Sara, which could have been spiteful and bitter, but is a loving gesture.  Desire continued his commercial streak by peaking at number one in early 1976.  The streak would come to end with Desire as well as Mr. Dylan has yet to again top the album charts.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies of all time. Every element of this motion picture is pure class: the cast, director, script, special effects, musical score, etc. It was the first major screen adaption of a comic book superhero, and arguably still the best (although the new &quot;Spiderman&quot;, slated for release in 2002, looks to be a major contender). While special effects technology has greatly advanced over the past two decades, no other superhero film has so accurately depicted a character as well as &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;. It is a truly magical Hollywood product that has aged remarkable well over the past 20+ years. However, as with so many other film series, the sequels which followed were progressively less fulfilling, but the original remains a remarkable achievement.<br />Riddle me this - how is it that a lame piece of crap like &quot;Supergirl&quot; get a deluxe two-disc release with THX mastering and a plastic box, while the man of steel only rates a single (albeit double-sided) DVD and a flimsy cardboard case? I would have gladly shelled out $5.00 to $10.00 extra for THX mastering and proper-packaging. Even still, the extras on the &quot;Superman&quot; DVD are exceptional, providing more than a night's worth of entertainment.
B00000253N|5.0|Blood On The Tracks is one of Bob Dylan's masterworks and easily the best album he released in the 70's.  Struggling through the breakup of his marriage to Sara, the situation gives the album  an emotional edge.  The album is among his most lyrical, with marathon songs like &quot;Tangled Up In Blue&quot;, &quot;Lily, Rosemary &amp; The Jack Of Hearts&quot;, &quot;Simple Twist Of Fate&quot; and &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; containing vivid lyrical tales in which Mr. Dylan throws out verse after verse in his famous cryptic style.  There is a sense of heartbreak and longing in &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot;, &quot;You're A Big Girl Now&quot; and &quot;You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When Toy Leave&quot;.  But he tempers the sadness with beautiful and tender songs like &quot;Meet Me In The Morning&quot;, &quot;Shelter From The Storm&quot; and &quot;Buckets of Rain&quot;.  After what many people considered an extended downtime for Mr. Dylan in years between 1970 to 1974, Blood On The Tracks showed that he was still capable of creating brilliant music.  He was also becoming more mainstream &amp; commercially popular as Blood On The Tracks was his second straight studio album to hit number one.
B00005AXEL|5.0|As a long time Stevie fan, I can truly say this is one of her finest albums. Each song gets better with each listen. Thank you Stevie, just for staying true to your music and fans.
B0000025OP|4.0|Bob Dylan and The Band had recorded together in 1967, but those songs would remain unreleased until a portion of them appeared on 1975's The Basement Tapes.  The first official release by this famous pairing was 1974's Planet Waves.  The album is often criticized as is doesn't live up to the expectations created by such a high profile pairing.  The problem is that the expectations were so high, it would have been difficult to meet them.  The album does just fine and is very good and in some cases great.  One of those great cases is the classic &quot;Forever Young&quot; which appears in two different versions.  On the original album, the first version closed out side one and the second opened up side two but on the cd they appear back to back.  It is interesting to hear them flow into one another and they equal greatness is tough to deny.  Other great songs include the mournful &quot;Dirge&quot;, the sweet and loving &quot;Wedding Song&quot;, the bluesy &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Something There Is About You&quot;.  The album ironically became the first number one album of Mr. Dylan's career and the one and only time that The Band reached the summit on any charts.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This cd is classic Stevie. Every song is great, and it was definitely worth the wait. My favorites(even thought I love them all) are: I Miss You, TIS~L, Sorcerer, Planets, Too Far From Texas, Fall From Grace(this song rocked on the blockbuster awards), and Love Is. IF YOU ARE A STEVIE FAN, GET THIS CD! IT'S GREAT. I got it yesterday, and I haven't listened to anything else.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|First of all, anyone who knows basic WWII history understands that the Americans, in ADDITION to the Brits, did recover Enigmas.  The British were the first to do it, yes, but the US also did it.  So stop freaking out over a movie--its a movie, not a documentary.<br />Matthew McConaughey, Harvey Keitel, and every single cast member of this movie is spectacular.  Every last one.  They work together so well, they really made the movie convincing.<br />The special effects are incredible.  The sound--especially if you have a Dolby-ready television--blows you away.  I could watch those splashes fall all day long.<br />The story line can be a little hoky at times, just like any other movie--the axe scene, the cheesy final scene--but the rest of the movie makes up for it.  This is one of the most gripping movies in recent memory.<br />The special features are incredible.  For all you staunch history buffs--everyone reviewing so far seems to be one--the shorts &quot;Inside The Enigma&quot; and &quot;Britain Captures the U-110&quot;, and the documents in the &quot;U.S. Naval Archives: Capturing the U-505&quot; section, each give you the full, true story of how the Enigmas were seized.  Jonathan Mostow repeatedly reminds us the the British were the original ones who captured the machine.  So you can't claim that this is all &quot;propaganda&quot; if the director, producers, and actors will tell you that it was originally the British.<br />The special features are what truly make this DVD spectacular.  It has so many more than most DVDs, and they are all superb in quality.  Its especially interesting to listen to the story of the British submariner who was the first to grasp the Enigma, and also to see how they painstakingly recreated sea-worthy U-Boats for the film.<br />Aside from all the tedious nitpicking, this is an INCREDIBLE film, and its something everyone can enjoy.  Its the one DVD in my collection that I can watch over and over again, and never tire of.
B000002JSP|5.0|I had never listened to much Led Zeppelin before I was introduced to &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; by a close friend. Since then, I have acquired every Led Zeppelin album except Presence on vinyl, and although they are by far the best band of all time, nothing compares to Fool in the Rain. It's just a song that makes you go, &quot;Uh!&quot; The album gets 5 stars for this song alone.
0345440757|1.0|After seeing Tracey Hogg on Dateline I recommended her book to my friend, a new mother who'd been having trouble getting her baby to sleep. We found this book simplistic and superficial, not helpful at all. We were also disappointed that Hogg's only reference to circumcision was her advise on caring for the wounded penis. For someone who claims to be so sensitive to babies feelings and an advocate for children, we found her to be neither.  Save your money. If you must satisfy your curiosity go to the library, or the used book store where it's certain to be available soon at a dramatically reduced price.
B00004XONN|5.0|I'm not a radiohead groupie I came to radiohead through this album, and I loved it from the first listening for its uncluttered and content-rich experimentation, its poignant and smart lyrics, but mostly for the depth of feeling the band's infused into their use of new music media and their brilliant use of (often imitated but rarely, as here, used well) non-hierarchical composition. If you're trying to compare one of their releases to another one, you're wasting your time. The attitude, quality of songwriting, and that emotion have remained consistent, while their songwriting construction and use of their media has evolved from Pablo Honey by leaps and bounds - what impresses me most about this band is they never repeat their success - they reinvent it entirely each time. The sample tracks from Amnesiac offer a glimpse of the next step. The consciousness that wants to unify their records is something Radiohead itself would rail against.  Celebrate the differences.
0446364495|3.0|Married folks know that love changes over time. We wives want husbands that act like boyfriends. Yet we don't act like &quot;girlfriends&quot;, do we? The woman here is not as sympathetic as Elise in Defenders of the Holy Grail, but she has the honesty of Elise. Of course, Defenders has more exotic places, and the psychic element. But the author's syles are similar. I recommend both books.
6305736650|5.0|Sweaty palms and an ever-present awkward silence interrupted by erratic and unintelligible squeals of two shy and squeaky voices.  There is nothing more anticipated or more feared than the first date. Dinner and movie and, if both survive, maybe a second date.   The one component of such a date is the movie choice - nothing too scary and nothing too obscene, but something just right: the perfect love story.  Although many times deemed as a \\"chic flic,\\" a love story can make or break a date and, consequently, a relationship.  Casablanca is one of the greatest love stories of all time; it has all the elements of not only a quality film, but the extra details needed for a love story.   The story line and setting of Casablanca are the bases for the timeless quality of the film.  The setting of the movie has a great impact on its viewers, if the film is set in a foreign country there is an added aura of mystery and danger.  The fact that story takes place in Paris and mainly Casablanca adds to the romanticism of the movie.  Paris, \\"the city of lights,\\" is considered to be a very romantic city and Casablanca is a very exotic location.  Those watching the film gain an added sense of wonder and excitement with foreign location, instead of the familiar sites of their homeland.    The time frame of the movie also adds to its fame.  Casablanca takes place during World War II and one major character, Victor Laslow, is in danger of being caught by the German army.  In the beginning of the story Rick, the main character, has to leave Paris because of the German threat.  The constant presence of army officials adds an element of danger to the film, therefore making every action of the characters even more meaningful because they are risking their lives for the sake of someone they love.  The time frame also adds to the viewer's identification with the movie.  Most everyone is familiar, especially at the time when the film was released, with the war. The thought of World War II affects people in different ways and bring back certain memories of loved ones lost to the war. The film was probably more embraced by its viewers than it would have been if the war had not been mentioned.    Adding to the aspect of danger is the element of drama, which gives the filmmaker the ability to play with the emotions of the audience.  This drama can be seen in the lines of the characters, such as: \\"we'll always have Paris\\" and \\"Here's looking at you kid.\\"  These phrases not only add to the drama, but have become universal and add to the lasting popularity and remembrance of the film.  The major characteristic of the film that is responsible for this drama is the lighting.  The filmmakers were both limited and fortunate that the movie was filmed in black and white.  They were limited because they could not use the color of the settings or costumes to impact the movie in any way.  But they were fortunate because they were able to use the black and white to their advantage.  Casablanca is one of the most visually powerful movies there is.  The lighting on the set is so precise that, at first, it is not even noticed.  The movie contains unforgettable scenes that leave a lasting impression on the viewer.   Casablanca is a well-made film that transcends age, gender, and social and cultural barriers.  It is a classic that still brings us to tears every time we watch it. What makes this such a great love story is the ending.  The guy does not get the girl.  He goes through hell to save her and then tricks her into leaving the country with her husband.  He makes the ultimate sacrifice and watches his only true love fly away with another man. If the film had turned out any other way it would not have been such a success.  The story encompasses the kind of love that everyone wants to feel for someone - when you love someone enough to let them go.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is incredible.  Walking out of the theatre, the movie causes the viewer to be speechless.  The ending of the movie is rather unexpected.  At the end when Lester realizes and sees all this beauty in the world and has begun to appreciate it, he is killed.  Though very disturbing, that scene causes one to think.  Would I want to be 100 years old and live a life being ordinary and never appreciating beauty or live to be 50 years old and truly value beauty?  Too many times, people go-go-go and never stop to see a blowing bag or leaves blowing in the wind.  American Beauty forces the viewer to be grateful for all the beauty in the world and in ourselves.  The movie makes you cherish every moment in life and to be grateful to God that he made you.  American Beauty is a must see movie!
0451527712|3.0|This book was not all THAT great.  I found it rather boring most of the story because Dr. Frankenstein and the wretch talk on for, what seems like ages, when they could 'sum it up' in about one paragraph.  The theme is great, but it was a long book for what Mary Shelley is portraying.  I recommend seeing the movie, as the lighting up scene in the movie is MUCH better then the one in the book.  The book stated something of this sort: And then he was alive.  Nope, no lightning, no of those 'shreeky funny squealing noises' evil doctors make.  In fact, Dr. Frankenstein wasn't that evil at all.  I don't recommened reading this book on your own free leisure time unless you enjoy reading classic books.  I think this book is classic because they made a good movie out of it.  If you have read this book: you cannot learn the whole english language in TWO YEARS!  Another thing that bugged me was the fact that some of the stuff in it was so surreal.  If you want to read surreal, might I recommend THE ODYSSEY.  Yet, I gave it 3 stars because it is a classic and obviously there has to be SOMETHING good about it, but I have yet to find that!

At the end when Lester realizes and sees all this beauty in the world and has begun to appreciate it, he is killed.  Though very disturbing, that scene causes one to think.  Would I want to be 100 years old and live a life being ordinary and never appreciating beauty or live to be 50 years old and truly value beauty?  Too many times, people go-go-go and never stop to see a blowing bag or leaves blowing in the wind.  American Beauty forces the viewer to be grateful for all the beauty in the world and in ourselves.  The movie makes you cherish every moment in life and to be grateful to God that he made you.  American Beauty is a must see movie!
B000002TPS|5.0|Why on Earth are there so many so-so reviews for this album and so many reviews that are just calling this album &quot;good&quot;? This is one of the BEST albums Megadeth has ever put out, PERIOD. This is a PHENOMENAL album and any other incredible, superior adjective you want to use to describe this album. All of the tracks are so hard and heavy with an exceptional voice by Dave Mustaine. The guital playing is top-notch, with many varied instrumental riffs that you won't soon, or ever, forget. The last three tracks that culminate this superior album flow SO EXTREMELY WELL (from one track to the next), as with the whole album, that it rivals that of my favorite Megadeth album, 'Rust In Piece'. If you love hard, hardcore, heavy music and Hard, Heavy-Metal albums, you will LOVE this album by one of the greatest Heavy-Metal bands to ever walk this Earth, MEGADETH!!! (P.S. Check out Megadeth's NEW album coming out in stores on May 15, 2001....it's supposed to be a VERY HEAVY album going back to their roots from the 80's and even from this album; the 'MEGADETH' title on the cover of the album is almost exactly like the title on this album, but in BLOOD RED color! The album should be INCREDIBLE, like this one!)

B00003CXP1|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's follow-up to his acclaimed indie debut 'Pi' is an expertly made nightmare, chronically the lives of four characters, woven together through addiction and tragedy. It does not sugar-coat it's subject matter. It is brutally frank in it's depiction of drug use and the ultimate physical, mental, and emotional deterioration that comes from losing control of one's own life to drugs. Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, a lonely woman whose husband has passed away and whose son, Harry (Jared Leto), only comes to visit when he needs to take her television set down to the pawn shop for drug money. She is addicted to television and sugar, eating chocolates while watching her game shows, day in and day out. She receives a junk phone call one day, a call that misleads her into thinking that she is going to be a contestent on one of these shows. She is ecstatic. She will wear her red dress, the one she wore to her son's high school graduation. The problem is, she no longer fits into it. So she tries a diet, but her need for sweets is too great and chooses diet pills instead. Harry spends his days with Tyrone (a straight and wonderful Marlon Wayans) who is the man with the connections, and his nights with Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his girlfriend. Each of these three characters is already addicted to drugs, not one in particular, rather anything to keep them feeling right. Harry and Tyrone devise a scheme by which they will become dealers, insuring the constant income of money and the possible score of something really, really good. Aronofsky's technique is brilliant, using every cinematic trick in the book to fully realize the effects of the drugs they're shooting, snorting, smoking, or swallowing. Over and under-saturated colors, quick jump cuts, overexaggerated sounds, slow motion, fast motion, steady cam, split screen... everything blazes by in a strange hallucinatory way when the characters are using. Everything seems skewed but yet right. When they come down, the film's look seems to slow down with them and the illusion fades. The world becomes dank again, becomes dull and hefty, the weight of normal life is felt. The film is not a happy story, the characters go from bad to very, very bad to beyond rescue by it's finale. Each character ends up where they should and not because we want them to. Each character is a tragedy, they are glimpses of lost dreams, abandoned hopes, failed promises, and needless depressions. By the film's end we feel sorry for them, not because they were addicted to drugs and suffered the consequences of them. But rather we for the fact that they even shot up in the first place. What a waste of life. 'Requiem For A Dream' is a masterpiece of cinematic direction and is a tough, unflinching film. It should be watched by parents with their teenage children. It's probably the best deterrent to drug use that exists right now. A cautionary tale that is both heartfelt and heart breaking. One of the best films of 2000.

B00002E233|3.0|Renny Harlin is a hack, OK? He's Jan De Bont, he's Stuart Baird, he's Roland Emmerich. But. irretrievably derivative as it is, &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; is the only one of the bank-breaking B movies he's made that verges on actually being  a right old hoot. And the only one that isn't even remotely dull. Never mind the claptrap about sharks taking smart drugs. And yes, the cribs are telling and obvious. Shameless even. A little &quot;Abyss&quot;here, a dash of John carpenter's &quot;The Thing&quot; there and magnificent dollops of &quot;Jaws&quot;.( And if sequel rumors prove accurate, a large helping of &quot;Hard Rain&quot; , that ungodly B movie starring Morgan Freeman,  will be added to the stew ) But of course.  Still there's something Hawksian about it that makes my nose hairs do jigs. Most of the time against my better judgment. A group of people  sardined in a cramped space while evil lurks, or swims, in the storm-ravaged outside. You know the drill. But it's a terrific drill. Harlin is far (very far) from being a Hawks or a Carpenter or a Speilberg.But here, for once, he's stalwart , cunning and game where he used to be clueless,  vacuous and self-important.  Samuel Jackson and LL Cool J are, as per usual, fun. Thmoas Jane and Saffron Burrows are not.  But Harlin gives us  very little downtime between the set pieces to care. Besides, wooden actors are what makes B movies fun. And the sharks are the real MVPs of this  movie, just as the extras are the real reason to shell out the moolah for this DVD. Still. This timekilling mother has bluster and velocity to spare which, when you've got nothing better to do, is  an infintely sweeter deal than soiling yourself with such crap as &quot;The Haunting&quot; and &quot;US Marshals&quot;.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This has to be.. the best movie ever.  I've got to keep this short, since I've written so many reviews on it, but this movie is so full of surprises.  I've seen it over 40 times and it is still my favorite movie.  The DVD is even better.  It has all these special features on it.  It's great.  BUY IT!
B00005AXEL|1.0|Stevie Nicks once the free spirited poetic songwriter behind such classics as &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;, is back after a seven year break, and in her most hyped effort yet, continues to prove that she is out of touch with nothing relevant to say.  &quot;Trouble In Shangri La&quot; is littered with weak attempts to recapture the magic that was once commonplace in her music.  No poetry or magic here.  Lyrics like &quot;Ive touched with gossamer wings to be quiet around you&quot;, and &quot;high priestess I'm the keeper of the peace in this&quot;  are weak attempts at Stevie doing her best to sound like herself.  In a strange way she has almost become a parody of herself.  Once insightfull and introspective, her lyrics sound more now like the scribblings of a teenager than that of a 52 year old songwriter.  On &quot;I Miss You&quot;  Nicks again sings about &quot;fame as only he could explain it to me&quot; blah blah blah.....Not interested.  On &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot;, the most narcissistic song on the set, inspired by Tom Petty, Nicks comments &quot;that made me stronger, that made me hold on to me&quot;, in response to his validation of her songwriting ability.  Nicks comes across insecure on this track and rightfully so.  The 3 best songs on the album were not surprisingly written back in the seventies and have been on fan bootleg tapes for years.  &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;, and Candlebright all have strong arrangements, but on these tracks it is Nicks' now weathered voice that fails her terribly.  She is unable to belt in the upper register of her voice like she used to and the once melodic, untamed instrument that was her voice , has become self concious monotonous and colorless.  Macy Grey, Sheryl Crow and Natalie Maines sing all the high parts that Nicks can't, and steel the show on all of the tracks they participate on.  As a matter of fact,musically, the cd is one of her best arranged and most interesting to date.  The album cosistently fails because of mid-range colorless vocals and childish lyrics.  Recorded 15 years ago, tracks like &quot;Planets&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot; would have soared with THAT VOICE.  Instead,  Stevie plays it safe, and in the end her lack of passion, and insight on the real world are the downfall of this cd.  Stevie needs to stop writing about her poor famous traumatic life and get back to the poet in her heart.  Don't waste your money on this one.
B00004XMS0|1.0|One of the main reasons to buy a boxset is for the extra features that may not be available if you were to purchase a dvd seperately.I don't see any listed here.Where is the running commentary,an making of featurette,behind the scenes,storyboards,theatrical trailers?This is dvd,there is plenty of storage space for all of that.Come on Warner Bros.,get a move on.You expect me to buy a boxset after i already purchased the first 3 seperately,but you're not willing to add extras?I'm a huge Batman fan of the first three.Keaton played the Dark Knight with a certain mystery and underlying pathos,Kilmer played him as a man who is confused when it comes to women,and someone who begins to question his priorities.Was fighting crime an selfish endeavor,or an selflless responsibility.All of them look and sound great,but the 4th was a total misfire,and not just because Clooney,among others,was miscast.I said it before about Jurassic Park,give me an boxset version with DTS audio,loaded with extra features,and for me this would be another definite purchase.
1878424319|5.0|This was a gift for which I'm so grateful, and also a gift for the entire world...wisdom profound and true, in language simple enough for anyone to be able to understand.<br />Don't skip the introduction (a habit I indulge in sometimes) as it's an explanation of this dream we call life. Chapter 1 will open your eyes to just how much you've been &quot;domesticated&quot;...&quot;Death is not the biggest fear we have; our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive and express what we really are&quot;.<br />Chapter 2: The power of language. &quot;If you make an agreement with yourself to be impeccable with your word, just with that intention, the truth will manifest through you and clean out all the emotional poison that exists within you&quot;.<br />Chapter 3: I love this chapter ! It's about not taking anything personally. &quot;Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves&quot;<br />Chapter 4 is about not making assumptions, and the chaos we create when we make them. Chapter 5 is about just doing your best...not trying to do more, or being lazy and doing less. &quot;If you do your best always, over and over, you will become the master of transformation&quot;.<br />Chapter 6: &quot;Breaking old agreements&quot;. Breaking free of &quot;domestication&quot;...another great chapter, one that will challenge and change you. Chapter 7 is about achieving &quot;Heaven on earth&quot;, and the book ends with 2 lovely prayers.<br />This little book of wisdom in the ancient Toltec tradition will help you find the path of the warrior, and the freedom to be &quot;Master of your own dream&quot;.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks has finally reinvented herself with the long awaited  CD, Trouble in Shangri-La.  On the day of its release, Shangri-la was #2 in sales on Amazon.com. Astounding. This record is her best effort since Bella Donna, her first solo album.  It,too,is destined to become a classic.  The title track paints pictures with words as its mantra-chant-like chorus repeats.  In Shangri-La Stevie  challenges herself with higher notes and different vocal styles--reminiscent of her early days. Stevie has inspired an entire generation of singers and songwriters, several of whom appear on this CD. Guest vocals by Macy Gray blend seamlessly with Stevie's own in &quot;Bombay Sapphires&quot;. (Ever notice the similarities between Macy's outfits and Stevie's?) <br />Trouble in Shangri-La not only pleases Stevie's die-hard fans, but is destined to make fans of those born in the 80s.  A must-have.
0380788624|5.0|Having avoided Neal Stephenson like the plague for some time (lumping him with William Gibson, whose books I despise), I just read SNOW CRASH, then CRYPTONOMICON in quick succession, and LOVED both.  CRYPTONOMICON is long as heck, but a real page-turner.  Sure, it's fragmented, but the multiple plot lines DO merge, into a wonderfully geek-oriented romp through history, intrigue, and the art and science of cryptography.  This is fun fiction writing at its best -- a great story with humorous, light writing and an engaging style.<br />As a software developer with some experience in crypto, I found it interesting that Bruce Schneier (author of APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY) developed the crypto system used within the book (described as an appendix).  Geeks of my sort will find lots to love here, as will those with a Libertarian bent (strong privacy advocation throughout). Fun, fast, and good, it's one of my favorite light books.
B00004U8P9|5.0|As you hear in the special feature section, this is Richard O'Brien's first musical started off in a small threater.  The original casts were used for the movie including Tim Curry, Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn.  Nobody in the original cast thought it would become such a subculture. Even today, 'Time  Warp' does not have that 'old fashion' feeling.<br />    Some people might find music very hard to appreciate for the first time, but as you get to know it you just cannot stop listening and singing along to it.  <br />    The first time you watch it, you might want to turn it off but keep watching it has something more than homesexuality.<br />    You WILL treasure it for the rest of your life!!!
0684865130|4.0|I am one of those rare people who somehow was never required to read CATCH 22 whilst still in the clutches of high-school English teachers.  Recognizing this deficiency, I recently read CATCH 22 for the first time, and found it wonderfully comic, yet simultaneously dark and frightening in its implications.<br />Intended as a scathing satire of war and the military, CATCH 22 is firmly rooted in the bizarre.  The characters are delightful in their insanity (also evidenced by their names, i.e., Colonel Korn, Major Major Major Major), and each portrays some aspect of the horrible side of human nature (Nately's sad naivety, the gnawing self-loathing of Major Major), mostly to the total exclusion of any happier traits. With such a cast, thrown into the confusion of World War II, CATCH 22 can only be a strange tale. Personally, it reminded me of the sort of black comedy that leaves you feeling dazed afterwards (for movie lovers, think NIGHT SHIFT), reeling from the confusion and horror of it all.<br />It elicits strong emotions -- frustration and anger not the least of them -- which I suspect was the author's real intention.  I often wonder why books touted as &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;great&quot; must be so bizarre. CATCH 22 is not necessarily easy to read, and it seems that only adds to the praise it receives. Perhaps CATCH 22's ability to make the reader a part of the confused, rambling story is based firmly in this bizarreness.  <br />Personal hint: read this book twice.  You'll catch much, much more the second time through.
B000002MVT|5.0|This CD is a fabulous compilation of that slightly off-kilter Southern rock/blues that distinguishes ZZ-Top from all other rock bands. These boys have a righteous appreciation of the music that built their unique sound. This is a &quot;must have&quot; CD for all rock/blues fans.
B00005AXEL|4.0|When i heard Stevie was making a new album i was hoping it wasnt going to be like &quot;Street Angel&quot;.Well it turns out its a whole lot better.Just about every song is great.I was alittle disapointed that she didnt write all the tracks.Stand out tracks &quot;Love is&quot; by far one of Stevie's best,&quot;Bombay Saphires&quot;,and &quot;Trouble in Shangri- La&quot; has already become a classic in my book.Her voice has never been better.Production is top notch.If this doesnt earn her a Grammy then i hope the album art will.The most beautiful album art i have ever seen...
0064430227|5.0|We have Harold and the Purple Crayon and Harold Goes to the Sky. My 3 year old LOVES these books, and they're great for helping him with his imaganination..and his 34 year old mommy likes em too!!
B000002KKS|5.0|Heaven and Hell is Black Sabbath's best album ever, even better than the classic Paranoid. It must be the perfect hard rock/metal album, every song is good. Children of the Sea, Neon Knights, and Heaven and Hell should still be played at every Sabbath concert. Ronnie James Dio was probably the best singer that the band ever had (sorry Ozzy), and his few albums with them are some of the best ever in hard rock/metal. Forget all of the new metal wannabee's and buy this insted!
B00005AUBA|2.0|A Mogwai LP is like deep sea diving.  The listener becomes immersed in subtle soundscapes and is led willingly as the environment changes.  After an hour, we rise back to the surface, enlightened in some way by the experience.<br />As I popped Rock Action into my stereo, I was dressed in my mental wetsuit with diving tank strapped on.  I was ready.  The first sign of trouble came with the LCD display telling me that my journey would be only 38 minutes...which seemed wrong.  But I remained the optimist; I trusted these guys.<br />My listening experience could best be described as expecting to go deep sea diving in the Caymans, and winding up in the fountain at the Public Park.  I sat on the step, water lapping at my shins, as the last few notes of Secret Pint faded out.  <br />There are a few moments of genius.  Mogwai features a much fuller sound on the few songs they seemed to put a lot of effort into.  You Don't Know Jesus and 2 Rights Make 1 Wrong are brilliant, full sounding songs deftly shifting moods, indicating Mogwai's continuing evolution.  Sine Wave serves as a perfect intro song, and Take Me Somewhere Nice, though clumsy, is a pretty good song.  <br />Yet, even these songs have a mainstream feel to them; as if Mogwai has lost faith in their ability to convey their moods subtly and effectively.  Their music used to speak for itself, now the production does.  A further indication of this is that half of the songs feature vocals; something that doesn't seem to belong in a Mogwai album.  Mogwai may be evolving, but they seem to be evolving toward where many bands are going, at the price of losing their individuality.     Now the junk.  Two of the songs, O I Sleep and Robot Chant, are 1 minute filler songs (perhaps to give the CD LP status?) that leave you a bit confused, wondering why Mogwai would bother with songs like that.  Dial: Revenge, featuring Gruff Rhys, sounds like a boring Super Furry Animals B-Side.  I couldn't enjoy Secret Pint through my disappointment knowing this was it.  <br />I have EP's longer than this, and felt a bit put out paying an LP price for Rock Action.  I doubt many other bands can get away with calling an 8 song, 38 minute CD an LP.       <br />Rock Action is like eating a bag of potato chips...they taste good but are rarely satisfying in themselves and provide scant sustenance.  For a full meal, refer to older Mogwai and bands like Godspeed You Black Emperor and Labradford, for Rock Action leaves you in the shallow end, shin deep, munching on potato chips.
B00003CXMG|1.0|Maybe I expected something different.   I grew up in the 70's and to this day it is still my favorite music to listen to.<br />I thought this movie was going to somehow capture that feeling.  Not through some cheezy nostalgia trip, but through interesting characters and plot lines.<br />The soundtrack is good, but it is WASTED on an inexplicably boring and lame story line.   No offense Cameron, but your life just wasn't as interesting to me as I think it was to you.  It just seemed to me like you were hanging with the most boring rock band ever. <br />Really...this movie is not worth your time.  If you don't believe me, rent it before you buy it.
0553812173|5.0|I can understand why this guy got a huge advance from his publisher toward the writing of another 8 novels in this sequence. He's a very gifted wordsmith and this novel is a fascinating read. It's a complex tale of military intrigue and very potent magic and does have a lot of characters, but if you have a brain in your head and are not afraid to use it, you'll find you won't be able to tear your eyes away from the page.<br />For me, this novel stands easily alongside Goerge R R Martin's current series in terms of depth of story and quality of writing and like a lot of the other reviewers listed below, I am looking very much forward to reading this author's future works.

B000002AH7|2.0|I think this is the only Miles Davis disk/record I've ever listened to that I honestly do not like.  This is most definitely not the &quot;cool jazz&quot; of Kind of Blue - it's a very different, brassier, in some places atonal and in-your-face type of jazz.  For me, it just didn't work.
6305399212|5.0|Okay, so we hate sequels, right?  Uh uh....<br />Director James Cameron's best idea was not to even make a true seuqel of 1979's &quot;Alien&quot; - though repairing Sigourney Weaver with the acid spewing, chestbursting, drool-challenged reptilian-insectoid and vaguely canine alien of the first film, and using the first story as a base, Cameron has created a sequel more original than films that don't purport to be sequels.  In the original film, Ellen Ripley is one of seven crewmembers of a spacegoing freighter owned by the mysterious (though apparently all-powerful &quot;company&quot;).  When the crew lands on a remote planet in response to what may be a distress call, they unknowingly pick up a bug that systematically picks off the crew before being dispatched by Ripley.  <br />In the opening minutes of the sequel, we find that Ripley's narrow survival has a bitter edge - escaping her freighter, she's found drifting in space for nearly 60 years.  Thawed out of &quot;coldsleep&quot;, her memories of the alien terror are fresh while she lacks any friends or family with which to lean against.  Though eager to tell her story, nobody believes a word about acid-spewing, chestbursting aliens, and Ripley is written off as a nutcase.  Bolstering the case for insanity is the fact that the mysterious planet from whence the alien came has long been settled without so much as a complaint.  Certainly, if Ripley's tale of woe and acid had had the slightest amount of truth, somebody would have heard something.  And then nobody hears anything from the colony.  Far from convinced, the compamny nevertheless sends out a survey team of US Marines at the disposal of the company's amoral corporate rep (Paul Reiser).  Gung-Ho at first, the Marines land on the dark and remote planet to find it overrun almsot entirely with aliens.  Firefights ensue, arrogance is destroyed and the marines find themselves cut-off and alone.  Ripley, once thought a nut, is now the only hope the surviving marines have of getting off the planet.<br />Aliens excels because it doesn't really try to be a sequel to the first one - mostly because Cameron uses a completely different style.  Where the first film was slow and brooding, the first one takes the speed-is-life approach.  Cameron's aliens fly off the ceilings, jump from floors, almost ooze out of every crack and crevice.  These guys don't hide - they jump on cars, run into flame-throwers, beg for grenades.  Cameron goes for the adrenaline route, but there's a method to his madness - the camera stays smooth, and the action is choreographed so that we always know what's going on (assuming we can bear to look at the screen).  The aliens get a lot more screen-time, but Cameron skillfully sets the scene that reveals the aliens and keeps them shrouded at the same time, so we never think we're looking at guys in rubber suits (at least not guys we want to ever meet in a dark alley).  Though the pace takes a big dip midway through the film (that happens in every Cameron movie) it picks up again in time to head for a major climax (followed by another major climax) at the film's end, in which we get a final claimx, just so we can finish the film feeling jolted and bolted.<br />Aliens is also a human story - the marines come off as amoral lifers, but they go down as heroes, even Bill Paxton as the ceaselessly pessimistic Hudson and Jeannette Goldstein as the fearsome Vazquez.  Between the awesome visual effects and the speed of the action, you'll need to see this widescreen - don't settle for the cropped and edited version they air on FX.
B00000IOSU|5.0|People are constantly trying to explain themselves through music. If we are in love we find a song that has the ability to express our feelings. If we are angry we find a song that empowers us and makes us feel like we have the upper hand. In all situations music plays a large part in expression. Music is a very strong tool, which we use in a lot of ways. Some musicians have much more of a meaningful impact though. Sarah McLachlan is one of the best female music artists of all time. Her song lyrics have touched many people because they are introspective, and profound. Unlike Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, or any of the other \\"Queens of Teen\\", McLachlan writes her own music, and delivers invigorating live performances. Her music relates to her personal life, and allows her listeners into her mind. McLachlan also produces songs that anybody can link to their own experiences.  She has a way of getting in the head's of her audiences. McLachlan is simply captivating.   McLachlan's music is so insightful and introspective that those who are not willing to really take in her song lyrics cannot appreciate them. She has a consistent style that is so poetic. In concert she captivates her audience with her lyrics. She sounds just as real unplugged as she does recorded. I remember seeing her in concert and being totally in awe with her style. Her voice is radiant and she plays the piano beautifully. She is luminous, and her music is positively overwhelming. It is so easy to listen to McLachlan   because so many of her songs explain something, or relate to something in our own personal life. She really reaches out to her listeners and it is as if you are the only person off stage that she is talking to. The experience is almost surreal.  Many of her songs such as \\" I Will Remember You\\" have made deep impacts on many people that have heard them. At my friend Anna's graduation her mother played the song \\" I Will Remember You\\" for her and all of our friends. It became the universal goodbye song. It later appeared on our senior video at our graduation. McLachlan's songs are being used because they are meaningful. You couldn't find a Britney Spears' song being dedicated to anyone, or being used to express emotional feelings. McLachlan has that special effect. All of the things that she has to say are profound and introspective. We find ourselves falling in love with her words.   Sarah's most mainstream CD is Mirrorball. This CD touches and reaches out to a larger audience rather then   just hardcore McLachlan fans. This is a much more personal work which comprises all of her most popular live songs. Between many of the tracks she often talks to her audience, and it really makes it quite personable. This CD holds a lot of meaning, and defines her as a musician. This work is by far my favorite, and I listen to every track. It is not very often that you can listen to a CD from start to finish and like it entirely. That is why she is so great.  Sarah McLachlan has, and will continue to write songs that are versatile and deeply meaningful. She is a true musician that has wonderful things to say. Whether it is live or recorded, her talent is limitless. McLachlan will continue to be an icon for the music industry as well a favorite of her listeners.<br />McLachlan,Sarah. Mirroball. Arista Records, 1998.
B00005AXEL|1.0|I fell in love with Stevie at 11 in 1975, seen her countless times, held hands with her a concert in '94, and love all her solo albums and songs with FM, which is why it is such a major disapppointment after hearing &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; to say Stevie as we knew her is gone. The people who worked/appeared on this CD from the producers to Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLaghlan... managed to snap Stevie out of her magical, mystical trance.  This album sounds like everyone's else's out there -- mainly those of her guests. The linear notes say Sharon Celani and Lori Nicks were on there but I could barely hear them.  And Stevie's voice is losing its magic.  It's become far too nasally and thick to listen to comfortably and the work on this album accentuated that.  Only &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; and a couple others in combination earned the one star I rate this album.
B00005AUBA|3.0|I just would first like to get the point across to the readers that I love Mogwai. Their music is unlike anything else I've ever heard before. The emotions their songs stir up, are unparalled. I have often described Mogwai's music as &quot;the soundtrack to my life.&quot; I was really excited about Mogwai's new album. Upon hearing it, my first impression was generally not so good. Only after a few more careful listens, did I come to enjoy Rock Action. In my honest opinion though, it is a step back for Mogwai. There are certainly a nice number of tracks that are very good; &quot;Sine Wave&quot;, &quot;Take me Somewhere Nice&quot;, &quot;You Don't know Jesus&quot; and &quot;2 Rights Make 1 Wrong&quot; are four great examples. The rest unfortunately, range from okay to not good. &quot;O I Sleep&quot; and &quot;Dial:Revenge&quot; are two interesting songs, but they grow tiredsome very fast. If &quot;O I Sleep&quot; could have been longer and maybe expanded upon, it would've been a pretty good song. &quot;Secret Pint&quot; is only slightly above average, and I enjoy it on a higher level than I do &quot;O I Sleep&quot; and &quot;Dial:Revenge&quot;, but that too becomes somewhat tiredsome a lot sooner than I wish. As for &quot;Robot Chant&quot;, it is simply disappointing. It's really just a minute of noisy, scratching-like sounds. I don't find it artistic or very creative at all, and I wonder what Mogwai was trying to get at with this song. Rock Action is certainly not Mogwai's best work. In fact, there is only one song that comes close to challenging some of Mogwai's best works like Fear Satan, Tracy, Helicon 1 (being still my favorite Mogwai song), C.O.D.Y., or Small Children in the Background (and that's only listing songs off the top of my head, there are simply so much better Mogwai songs out there from their previous releases), and that credit goes to track 7, 2 Rights Makes 1 Wrong. It is easily the best track off the new album. In the end, Rock Action leaves you wanting just a bit more from it. It clocks in at about 38 minutes, and really, two of the songs are just barely a minute long. The result is somewhat unsatisfying. It is still a solid buy for any Mogwai fan though, and I highly recommend it to those that are. But if you're new to Mogwai, maybe checking out some of their older albums will give you a better impression of them.

1568495110|5.0|Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange tells the horroring tale of young Alex as he partakes in acts of ultra-violence and his reform which sends him right back to his evil ways.  The novel presents the question of: Is it better to be made to be good or is it better to have the choice of being good?  Anthony Burgess attempts to portray the extreme of youth and the capability of it's evil, but he is also able to show more than simply the aspect of evil, he shows the human side also.  Our narrator enjoys Beethoven and by this we see that he has intrests common to our own, not just that of crime.  This book was so well written using a unique dialect which Alex himself creates.  The reader soon becomes accustomed to this language and is able to sit back enjoy an extremely thought-provoking book which will send you off with a renewed hope for mankind.
B0000025DV|5.0|Why did this album capture my imagination so much as a kid? Was it the super cool cover? The hypnotic otherworldly production? The rush I got from turning Turn to Stone up real loud? The happy feeling I got from Mr. Blue Sky? I think the answer is &quot;all of the above&quot;. And happily, relistening to the CD after all these years still gives me that happy, magic feeling. Plus Jungle is a great tune for toddlers to bang drums to.
B000059Z8J|4.0|Here, finally, is Superman on DVD. And I am pleased to say that it  looks better here than it has ever looked on home video/laserdisc.  They have been able to remove a lot of the grainyness in those tricky scenes on Krypton and the color has a much punchier effect this time around.  Now the bad news for the purists out there (myself included). The sound has been given a serious make-over. Now, this is great on the one hand as John Williams' score finally gets the in-your-face, 5.1 treatment. The problem is that Warner Bros. has allowed the foley to be redone in many places.  The opening credits finally have the sound &quot;kick&quot; they have always needed but the wooshing sound is a brand new sound -not the original at all- and it is noticable to any fan. Several of Superman taking off shots now include an obvious &quot;new&quot; swoosh sound as well. Bummer.  Does Warner Bros. really think that kids today will enjoy this film better if they fool with it to make it sound like Star Wars(which also has been screwed with too much)?  This disc has plenty of goodies as well.  The screen tests are really interesting b/c we get to see Christopher Reeve BEFORE he got buff in his Superman outfit- he looks rather feminine. He also is sporting HUGE sweat marks under his arms. There are some surprises as we find out who was up for Lois Lane.  This is a must buy for fans but it is sad that the trend is to &quot;sweeten&quot; a film that is over 25 years old to make it more accessable.  The fact that it was made in 1978 is part of its charm today. Is the 33' Kong due for a make-over? Help!

0767827791|5.0|This is a subtle and rewarding film. The cast is magnificent--the performances great! One of my favorite film scores too!<br /> A hint for watching the movie. With each viewing, I find I have been concentrating on a different actor. Kim Novak is definitely at her peak; William Holden is remarkable; Rosalind Russell is at her very best, with a fantastically varied and difficult part; Susan Strasberg is wonderful indeed. All of the supporting actors are super too! And this IS primarily a story of individuals' lives, and how they are changed.<br /> The film gives a remarkably accurate picture of life in 1950's rural Kansas. But onto this background is thrust a love story of great interest and appeal. The film has super color and fine sound (for its era anyway).<br /> The film is, quite simply, astounding. Don't rent it....buy it, bucause it just gets better and better with repeated watchings!
B00005AXEL|5.0|&quot;Trouble In Shangri-La&quot; is unmistakably classic Stevie Nicks, hauntingly (un)familiar and beautifully rendered. 'Timeless' melodies that draw you in and hold you_ &quot;Sorcerer&quot;_ as they transport you to somewhere_&quot;Trouble In Shangri-La&quot;_ sometime_&quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot;_ and someone else_ &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; hit me way 'too close to home'. Epertly-written lyrics which when delivered in Stevie's inimitable poetic style,(My Goddess, my God...thank you for that voice) fly you beyond mountain heights_&quot;Planets Of The Universe&quot;_ and bring you down to earth_&quot;I Miss You&quot;_ then plunges you ocean deep_&quot;Fall From Grace&quot;_ the way ONLY Stevie can. Everything one can hope for and expect from Stevie Nicks is here. There is love of heart/heart-break, strength of mind, passion of body, depth of soul. And beauty_ always there is beauty!  This musical journey into and out of 'Paradise' is nothing short of wonderful! Tickets come highly recommended. So book yours now. I guarantee it will be an experience you'll cherish forever.
B000000H7I|4.0|It didn't take much listening to like this album. The first time I heard those DEEP, gurglely vocals I was hooked. I was disappointed to hear &quot;Pierced...&quot; because the vocals were cleaner. Yeah, maybe it's technically superior, but this is more raw, like he's drowning in a pool or choking on his own vomit or something. The only vocals comparable to this album is Dying Fetus, which I also highly recommend. The rhythms and sycopated beats are fabulous too. That seemed to be lost on &quot;Pierced&quot; as well. Get.
B00005AXEL|5.0|It has been too long since Stevie Nicks fans have had the pleasure of hearing new music from this fabulous songwritter. Once again, Stevie has brought out many emotions on her new album Touble In Shangri-La. I had to run out &amp; get it immediately today. After reviewing the entire cd, I have to say that it is flawless! The first track, self-titled &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La&quot; is a perfect opening to the new cd. The track &quot;Sorcerer&quot; is very Stevie-ish, and I love the way she hits the higher notes on this song. &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; has great harmony on it.  To sum it up, all of the tracks on this inspirational cd are such a treat! Honestly, I have to say my very favorite is &quot;Fall From Grace.&quot; It is a powerful, full-force driving song. I highly reccomend that you purchase this one, you will be enjoying it for years. I can tell that it will just get better &amp; better each time you hear it. To all of the true Stevie fans out there, Stevie is back and at her very best! Enjoy!
B000002H8F|3.0|This is probably the Pixies' weakest album, especially disapointing when stacked against it's precursor, the legendary &quot;Dolittle&quot;.  It obviously lacks the care-free feel &amp; innovation of their earlier work, and got a icey reception when it was first released.<br />But even then, the Pixies' weakest album is still a pretty good one.  There are some nice futuristic, spacy songs like &quot;All Over the World&quot;;  and &quot;The Happening&quot; was good enough to be ripped off by the Bloodhound Gang for their hit &quot;Fire Water Burn&quot;. <br />The album's main problem is a weak start and slightly labored delivery (and the silence of Kim Deal didn't help), but it's really not a bad addition into their catalogue and there is more than enough for fans to enjoy.  It's high points are better than those in the follow-up, &quot;Trompe Le Monde&quot;, it's just not as consistant.  That's the negative part of being an amazing rock band - *good* albums just aren't good enough.
0452281881|5.0|I was very impressed by this book. I bought it after seeing the reviews on this page, and I have to say I'm glad I did! The antics of the employees are hilarious! Each character has his or her own special trademarks, from the sad old anorak Nige to the sexed up Lorraine. This book has it all. There are a few characters that stick out most in my mind. Firstly, Pertti van Helden. He is a CEO in Finland. His cultural differences make his character all the more interesting. Another character I enjoyed was Liam. His quips made me smile. A lot.<br />As for good scenes, there are too many for me to mention. All I can say is, if you buy this book, look out for the scene with Simon Horne and his &quot;lady&quot; friend. &lt;BG&gt;<br />Great Read!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie is back with a little help from her friends.  It seems every Lilith artist is influenced by Stevie and several lend their talents.  Most notably Sheryl Crow who co-produced five tracks the sly, bluesy &quot;Candlebright&quot;, the dark &quot;sorcerer&quot;, the twangy &quot;Too Far From with Texas&quot; with great support from Dixie Chick Natalie Maines.  Sheryl crow lends her chops to the rockin' &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;.  The cd closes with stark, lovely ballad &quot;Love Is&quot; with ethereal vocals from Sarah McLachlan.  This cd takes me back to my pre-teen years when I came home with Bella Donna on vinyl!  Here's hoping Stevie doesn't take so long with the follow up!
0743201140|3.0|A great start to understand your personality strengths but not enough information on what to do with this evaluation.  You can purchase a subscription to a newsletter that discuses topics on this book, but again it is vague on disclosing what you get for your dollars.  I guess I'll be left here hanging until a book comes out:  \\"Now that you have discovered what you really already knew, here is how you can use it.\\"
B00005AXEL|5.0|I just received this CD.  I'm on my third listing right now...I don't know when I'll take the repeat off.  It is awesome.  Without a doubt one of best CDs I've ever heard.  The songs form a cohesive mixture.  I'll be very surprise if she doesn't top the charts again with this CD.  And maybe the country charts as well the Duet &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; with Natalie Maines certainly has the potential for a top 10 country song...For those Rock Fans, don't worry, Stevie is still rocking at 53...Buy this CD you won't regret it, I fell in love with Stevie all over again.
0060977493|4.0|At a bowling alley, after a you have knocked the carefully arranged pins all asunder, they lay scattered, ruins, victims of havoc wreaked by a crushing weight applied rapidly. Most modern American bowling alleys have installed useful equipment that sweeps up the chaos, and resets the pins, ready to get smashed again. Most modern American bowling alleys are also experienced with the phenomenom of having this equipment get jammed. THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS is a lot about sitting at the end of the alley, staring at the strewn remains of the catastrophic event, for, oh, 23 years.<br />The reason I use such a clumsy metaphor is that it is also mundane (and cliche). THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS brings an exotic setting, with exotic stresses, and makes it accessible to those of us who will never know India, and it's amazing history. By placing the events of the story amongst semi-familiar contexts -- TV-watching, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, expensive cars, Elvis records, family businesses, Christians (instead of Hindus), divorce and star-crossed love -- Arundhati Roy gives us a protective veil through which we can examine the &quot;exotic&quot; aspects of her otherwise conventional fable -- caste society, foreign language, colonialism, and of course, a viable, diable Communist Party.<br />Frequently, tales that use the unraveling of memory to examine a repressed traumatic event do not interest me. In this case, Roy also kept herself busy creating new ways to use the language of children and other small things. At times it seems precious, at other times is lightens the way, and sometimes it just seems to bog things down. I generally do not respond well to this type of writing, but Roy seems to handle it nicely, and it provides a good disguise for the familiar traumas. Nevertheless, the language ultimately gives the story, as a whole, a sticky, sweaty feel, muggy, just like Ayemenem in 1969.
0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game is an extremely good book. You grow to love all of the characters. Orson Scott Card has a talent for writing, he keeps you wondering what will happen next, so you keep reading, then you find something else out and you got find somemore things out and the next thing you know, you finished the whole book. Ender is a real person, you can feel his pain, know what he's thinking, but you never know what he will do next. he has emotions, disappointments, and complications in his life. I've read the book three times already and every time I find something that I didn't know.
B00003Q43A|1.0|Two and a half hours of pain.  That's the best way to describe this train wreck of a movie.  There are two scenes in this movie worth seeing: the White House being destroyed, and Will Smith punching out the alien, saying &quot;Welcome to Earth&quot;.  Aside from those, it's two hours of bad acting, inane dialog, gaping plot holes, and pathetic stereotypes.  Watch it for the pretty special effects, enjoy throwing popcorn at the screen, and go home wondering why Randy Quaid still has a career after mouthing &quot;Here I am Mr. President&quot;.  Wonder why Judd Hirsch accepted the insulting role of &quot;the wise jew&quot;.  Wonder why Robert Loggia couldn't find anything better to do with his time.  But please, don't pay to see this disaster.  Wait for cable.
B00004XMTC|3.0|It is a long time since I last saw this film &amp; I could not remember the plot, but I do remember it as being the return of the quintessential Bond, Sean Connery. I was not dissappointed when as a late Easter present my wife bought it for me, I am a total Bond addict! It is not so full of modern day Bond weapons or gadgetry, but it is more like the first half dozen, a little more sophisticated where Bond had to use his brains &amp; stealth to get himself out of trouble rather than fantastic pyrotechnics. There are the compulsory vehicles, beautiful women &amp; well known characters in the form of Leiter &amp; &quot;M&quot; &amp; the inevitable down to the last minute conclusion, so all in all, despite the lack of the usual gun barrel beginning &amp; Bond theme, it is a thouroughly enjoyable film in the vintage vein of Bond. Well worth watching.
1878424319|5.0|This is a fabulous book which I hope is not taken too lightly. As a former trainer in Tony Robbins' Mastery University (1989-1995) I've seen thousands of people spend a lot of time and money trying desparately to improve their lives. But the most profound changes in people are created on the core belief level. Here's a book that addresses this level in a simple, truthful way.<br />I hope that Mr. Robbins gets wind of this book (maybe he has) because his type of deep-level unconscious training must never deviate or contradict the principles derived from these \\"four agreements.\\"<br />For those of you who are not familiar with Tony Robbins let's just say that he's a very influencial person who does large-audience seminars designed to change people's lives.<br />But anyone can change their lives for the better (quickly and economically) by making a serious study of this book.<br />The value of \\"The Four Agreements\\" greatly exceeds the cost. Make sure it's in your personal library. <br />It's a true gem!
0451160916|3.0|America's favorite thriller has been treading new grounds lately through electronic publishing, but a visit with The Shining takes the reader back to the classic Stephen King.  He has mastered the art of suspension and thrill and he stops at nothing to give the reader a good scare.<br />Set in the abandoned Overlook Hotel, the Torrance family attempts to reconnect after a long period of physical and alcohol abuse on the part of Jack Torrance.  This provides King the opportunity to thematically explore the cyclical nature of such problems.  While these themes stretched the expectations of genre-driven fiction, this reader didn't quite believe it was stretched enough to fit the large pants of literary fiction. But few look to King to provide a literary thrill. The thrills most readers are looking for with King can be found in The Shining.  I don't suggest reading this book alone, or at night, or while a snowstorm is looming.  King does a good job with bringing the reader into the `dream' of the narration that one invariably loses track of time.<br />Jack Torrance has his own motives for taking care of the hotel during its off-season. His career has floundered in recent years, and coupled with a scandal at his latest job, he is desperate to gain some peace and quiet to get back to the writer he once was.  <br />Throughout the novel several battles are being waged. First and foremost is the battle between the overlook hotel and the Torrance family.  King does an incredibly effective job of giving the hotel life, as every hotel has a history that seems to haunt it.  Yet King does not go over the top as a story about a haunted house would be capable of being.  The hotel haunts each member of the family in its own way.  In one touching scene Danny is convinced that a fire hose is about to attack him.  Though most children are fascinated by firemen and their equipment, Danny's `shining' coupled with his active imagination give King the leeway to play with such non-conventional thrill objects.<br />Another battle is that of Jack versus Jack. He has many demons that he brings with him to the hotel, alcoholism, a history of abuse from his family, his own instances of being the abuser, and less than admirable moral choices.  In the solidarity of the hotel Jack is alone with these demons, and the demons of the hotel are happy to help him along this path of dwelling on them.  Will Jack be strong enough to face his demons and the hotel's as well?<br />King also does an excellent job with the characters.  Told through the point of view of several different characters, the most poignant point of view, and most difficult to master, was Danny, the child of the family. What made Danny special was his \\"shining,\\" or his ability to read people's minds.  King juxtaposed this mature ability with Danny's vast inexperience to create a character who was vulnerable and lovable, yet not too sugary-sweet.<br />For those readers who have seen the movie, as is typical, the book is much better. I found Wendy to be much more believable and felt a great deal more sympathy for her in the book, while her role in the movie left the reader sympathizing with Jack's desire to be rid of her.  She is seen as an extremely concerned mother, and would do anything for her son. She'd like to believe that her son is safe with her husband, but discovers all too late her husband's true nature.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Like her peers Don Henley, Tom Petty, and Carlos Santana, Stevie Nicks has once again hit her stride in middle age. I remember my skepticism about a year ago after reading that Stevie was using several Producers on this album and wondered about the cohesion of the material. What's more, Stevie's songwriting has been inconsistent since the early 1980's and some of her past Producers have let her get away with too much pseudo-mystical mumbo jumbo that made her sound silly. And what about that voice after all these years ? With &quot;Trouble&quot; Stevie has put these issues away. Singing some of the best lyrics of her career, Stevie has never seemed more timeless and &quot;with it.&quot; &quot;Candlebright&quot; and &quot;Sorcerer&quot; are relics from the 1970's that Stevie and Producer Sheryl Crow have polished into gems while &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; is perhaps Stevie's best mid-tempo song since &quot;Gypsy.&quot; The sweet longing in &quot;Every Day&quot; recalls &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and reminds us that such travesties as &quot;When I See You Again&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot; are long gone. At the other end of the spectrum, the fiery &quot;Fall from Grace&quot; is an awesome rocker - a sober &quot;Edge of Seventeen.&quot; The high point of this CD is the sensational title track in which Stevie lets loose on an Ex.  As if her material was'nt great enough, Stevie's voice has not sounded this good since the 1970's. The only disappointment - the closer &quot;Love Is&quot; is reheated Sarah McLaughlin and rather bland. But with that lone exception this is the Stevie Nicks album that her fans have been wanting for years.
B00005AXEL|4.0|There may be Trouble in Shangri-La, but there is definitely nothing wrong with this disc...Stevie's latest features some of the best music I've heard in years.  First, there's the title track, which provides a haunting start to a CD that runs the entire emotional spectrum from love to loss to regret and rebirth.  Highlights include the Sheryl Crow duet on &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, the dreamy &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;, and the catchy love song that is &quot;Every day&quot; (No doubt you'll have the chorus of &quot;Every Day&quot; replaying in your head for quite some time).  I think the serious Stevie fan will also enjoy &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; which evokes the spirit of &quot;Highwayman&quot; from Stevie's 1981 debut album, &quot;Belladonna&quot;.  Although there were a couple of oddball songs that could have been dropped, I think the entirety of the work outweighs any flaws they cause. This is definitely the best work that Nicks has done solo-wise for nearly a decade, and if she doesn't win a Grammy for this, I'll be surprised.
B0000025VU|5.0|Perhaps Dylan's greatest album of the mid eighties.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks has again hit top form with her 2001 release &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La.&quot;  Collecting both new and old songs from her vault, Stevie treats the listener to a career's worth of styles musically and lyrically.   - &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot; is one of the newly written tracks &amp; reflects the insecurities and struggles one faces to regain self-confidence.   - &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; is a scorching rocker the likes of which Stevie hasn't recorded since 83's &quot;Nothing Ever Changes&quot; - a great return to form.   - &quot;Planets Of The Universe&quot; written in 1979 is pulled right out of Stevie's fabled past of love and loss (You will never love again the way you loved me, You will never rule again the way you ruled me.)   - &quot;Candlebright&quot;, the oldest song (1970) of the set is a beautiful prediction of the path Stevie has traveled. (Well you know me I'm a nomad, I can't feel bad, about the way I am.)  You shouldn't Stevie, THIS is why we love you.
B000001Y5J|5.0|As you know NIN never get old and it will take quite some time. This is a classic. It is almost the opposite of Pretty Hate Machine, which wasn't as loud and still diverse. It wasn't near sellout either. And he had problems with his former label TVT, getting prevented from another album, he didn't want to have to explain the same thing over and over again for the next five years. Then, Broken comes out and excells again.<br />This is the first NIN CD with any instrumentals. It has Pinion which repeats its tune but is still cool, and the bass influence, Help Me I Am In Hell. On this he keeps rock songs without them getting boring at all. And you probably know about the two famous tracks, Wish and Happiness In Slavery. I think it's cool how Happiness iN Slavery was so moody in sound. It always went from singing to screaming a little in each verse. Then, Gave Up, one of the best NIN songs to date. It ends a little repetitive but it's still awesome. Last is one that any The (the) fan should hear. The vocals remind me of something they'd make.<br />Then it gets to the two hidden tracks, Physical (You're So) and Suck. Physical is a cover of the Adam Ant one, which if you liked 10 Miles High, you'll like this too. It's got that bass that rolls on the full song, and in the middle he even says &quot;Eat your heart out, Steve&quot; in a whisper. Yes, He is talking about the TVT manager (I forget his last name). Then, if you like Pigface you've probably heard of Suck. This is mainly puts more of a blues rock tune in it. I'm not kidding either. And this one thumps in your head a lot too.<br />If you liked: KMDFM's Angst (also check out the Light single with a remix done by Trent), Pigface and Adam Ant's earlier stuff and are interested, The the, or the second Fragile disc, I recommend you this. ANd it's very inexpensive and short. All worth the price of. Add this to your collection. Especially any metalheads.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Troubel in Shangri-la, I think not. There is no trouble here just good music. This is the best that Stevie has had to offer since Belladonna. Of all cd's this year I feel by years end this will be the &quot;have to own&quot; cd. I bought this cd'd at noon and have listened to it at least 10 times already and it only gets better.
B00005AXEL|2.0|First of all, I'm sure that all of the nicksfix people and the other fans will fill this board up with 5 star reviews.  And they should, because they love Stevie.  I love Stevie, too, and had an advanced copy of this CD and also purchased it yesterday just to contribute my two cents to her sales totals. But I could not help being dissapointed.  I hate to say bad things about her, but I even liked &quot;Street Angel&quot; better.  &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; is a rocker alright, but it has too many of Stevie's cliches in it.  That &quot;you write your songs yourself&quot; line from &quot;That made me Stronger&quot; is actually embarassing to me, more so than the &quot;chimpanzee&quot; line from &quot;Jane&quot; on her last record.  It reminds me of Stevie just writing down sentences and singing them instead of poetry.  She does, however, have a great &quot;London to Paris&quot; line on one of the songs (I miss you?).  But what a dissapointing title track!!!  Stevie has always had excellent title tracks.  Epics!  Bella Donna, The Wild Heart, Rock a Little,and even Alice (based on title).  But this one is a nightmare.  The words are trivial and trite.  I feel the same about the &quot;Everyday&quot; single, but she did not write it.  However, if Faith Hill can crack the Top 10 with the junk she makes, then Stevie should have no trouble getting this song played, because at least it has character in the singer, if not the song itself.      I did give this two stars for one reason:  her voice.  I feel that she has not sounded this good since &quot;The Wild Heart.&quot; The other reviewer was right about the high notes.  She sounds EXCELLENT in &quot;Sorcerer&quot; (although I like the 70's demo better), &quot;It's Only Love&quot;, and &quot;Love Is&quot;.  As far as the three 70's demos that suddenly appear on this album, I do know that Stevie has much better material in the vaults than &quot;Candlebright!&quot;
630310696X|5.0|The movie Philadelphia, by Johnathan Demme, displays the struggle a homosexual man infected with AIDS encounters in obtaining justice because he was unfairly fired from his job.  Andy Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, seeks a lawyer to defend his case.  Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington, is the lawyer who defends Andy Beckett.  Miller is a character who the viewers can relate to because he is homophobic and has a great fear about AIDS.  The disease was not well known in the early nineties when the film was made, and Miller expressed the same fears of the public.  Joe Miller learned how to put his personal feelings aside and defend the law.  Although he does not agree with homosexuality and has a fear of the AIDS virus, Miller learned to look past those emotions and defend a homosexual man with AIDS to ensure that the law was upheld through justice.  Philadelphia is an excellent movie because the viewers can relate to the characters and learn from their experiences with homosexuality and AIDS.<br /> Joe Miller is a public defense lawyer who takes pride in his work.  He is up for any challenge and rarely refuses to defend a client.  Andy Beckett walks into Miller's office one day, seeking a lawyer.  Miller is startled by Beckett's appearance because he looks ill and has a few lesions on his face.  They shake hands, but Miller is extremely cautious about everything Andy touches.  Andy Beckett introduces himself and explains to Miller that his employer fired him because he lost a serious document.  Beckett wants to sue the corporation because he believes that he was fired out of prejudice.  Miller asks what the prejudice is, and Andy says that the prejudice was against AIDS.  Miller is afraid of the AIDS virus and does not wish to defend Andy.  Andy is disturbed by Miller's refusal, but kindly departs the office.  <br /> The doctor Miller saw directly after the meeting with Andy Beckett attempted to assure Miller that AIDS cannot be contracted through a hand shake ortouch, it is only contracted through sexual encounters.  Miller is still disturbed by the thought of AIDS, though, because he has a family to worry about.  The fear of this disease, however, did not stop Miller from thinking about Andy.  Miller is dedicated to the law and does not like to see unjust acts, but he did not know how to overcome his fear of Andy's virus.  He tried to convince himself that he denied Andy because he did not agree with homosexuality, but the truth is that he could not face his fear.  Many citizens of the United States had the same fear of AIDS in the late eighties and early nineties due to the rising number of outbreaks.  Scientists and doctors could not figure out a cure for this and people panicked.  The majority of outbreaks occurred in homosexual couples and people referred to the disease as the \\"gay plague\\" or \\"gay cancer\\".  Thus, hatred formed against homosexual people.  Miller displays this hatred in the movie.<br /> One day Miller is in the library reviewing material.  He sees Andy a few tables over.  A clerk is asking Andy if he would like to go to a private room after he brings him novels about AIDS.  Andy does not want to go to a private room and a small argument arises.  Miller walks over to Andy and starts talking to him.  The clerk leaves and a few people around him move to other tables.  Miller could not let his fear hold him back any longer.  He helps Andy research and decides to defend him in court.  A man's legal rights are more important than his personal situation.  Miller puts aside the fact that Andy is homosexual, and learns to focus on his rights rather than his AIDS.  <br /> As Miller grows close to Andy, he learns more about himself.  Throughout the case Andy becomes more and more ill.  Instead of being afraid of Andy as he was in the beginning, Miller is compassionate for him and the illness with which he struggles.  Miller is not cautious about touching Andy or being around his homosexual friends.  He learns to accept Andy for who he is and respect him as a human being.  Miller sets an example for society to follow.  The public needs to stop blaming homosexuals for the AIDS virus and learn about the disease.  Homosexual people also need to be treated as every other human being and society needs to learn how to accept them.  Miller proves that these acts can be accomplished in this movie.<br /> Philadelphia is a strong movie because it demonstrates two serious issues that citizens of the United States face.  Homosexuality and AIDS arose abruptly and many people panicked out of fear of the unknown.  The easy way out was to hate homosexuals because they were believed to be the cause of this disease as Miller did in the movie.  People merely needed to educate themselves on AIDS and get to know homosexuals.  They would discover that homosexuals are human beings just like everyone else and that the AIDS virus cannot be contracted through touch.  Joe Miller set an example for Americans to follow in the movie Philadelphia.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Until the recent Star Wars reissue Superman was the movie I had seen more times in the theater than any other film-somewhere between 15-20. When it was first aired on TV (over 2 evenings) it included several scenes that hadn't made it to the theatrical release or any previously released video version. Now, with the release of the Special Edition DVD we have... some of them. But even without the infamous golf course scene this edition rocks! The movie speaks for itself (as do the high ratings we've given it) but the bonus features included are worth the price of the DVD.  Seeing Christopher Reeve in the documentary was a treat. I'd been under the impression that he wasn't interested in talking about this film and was delighted to see him (looking pretty darn good too. I can't wait to see him act again). The screne tests are not only a nice piece of film history, but a testament to the positive evolution of the screenplay. These &quot;earlier drafts&quot; of well known scenes actually kinda stink. Fortunately they were improved for the film. What mskes this movie truely epic is the strength of the performers and the crew. Sure, there are moments of pure cheese, but there are also some compelling, dramatic moments as well. Lois's death is a scene permanently ingrained in my mind. What a great piece of my childhood, returning even better than I remember it.
B000002NBY|4.0|I'm strongly inclined towards rock, especially metal. After I passed the 30 years of age barrier, I began to search for some new grounds, musically speaking. That's why only now I heard this master-piece, released in 1986. What an album !! I think most of the reviews below are useless, trying to &quot;analyse the songs&quot;, the &quot; micture of rhythms&quot;, whatever. The album is just plain amazing, independent of the style or who wrote it. DOn't analyse the album: just listen to it.
B00005ASOC|4.0|'Finding Forrester' is a well done, in many ways very sensitive film, a relief compared to earlier productions with similar themes. <br />Some reviewers have critised that there is a stereotyping of racial identities in this film. I think stereotypes are entirely inevitable. I can't think of one single mainstream production devoid of them -- it is almost a natural defect inherent to mainstream cultural analysis. Personally I don't believe stereotypes have spoilt 'Finding Forrester', but I agree that an additional dose of realism would have enriched the film.<br />The first 'half' of the film is very carefully done. The camera work, the music -- for once not a double symphony orchestra --, Connery and Brown all contribute to create an atmosphere of great subtlety and truth (more than reality). There is also a very broad build-up thematically. Many issues are touched upon, in some cases with extraordinary care: race relations, teenage integration, boy-girl love, artistic frustration, social disadvantage, to name but a few. <br />When Jamal enters the writing contest at his elite school, the film takes an abrupt turn. Here we really fall into mainstream Hollywood clichés, that remind of 'Good Will Hunting' to an embarassing extent. Most of the careful build-up is completely lost when Forrester comes to save Jamal from Prof. Crawford. It fits badly that the text Forrester presents at the occasion is covered up by soapy music and cheap camera work. Indeed, it almost seems that the script-writer ran out of ideas for a good text! A quiet reading of a short, but pointed essay would have fit much better than the bloated scene we have. It would have made the approach to the final victory, the mentor saving the student, and hence overcoming his own problems, far more realistic. It would also have shown more continuity in the film. Moreover, many of the themes that were touched upon in the first part of the movie did not find any echoes in the end, and were left unconcluded. <br />It is possible that the producers feared the film would have been too long, and above all, lost its mainstream appeal, had they continued on the lines of the build-up. A great shame -- without this lack of courage, 'Finding Forrester' would have made an exceptional motion picture and a masterpiece of acting as well. <br />Nonetheless, it remains a powerful film, and should be seen, even if the final and concluding sequences are weak. It also shows how much further beyond 'Good Will Hunting' a production on this theme can go. 'Finding Forrester' points in the right direction. Well done.
0486278077|4.0|To be honest, I had two reasons for choosing this book. One was for a class assignment. Having a list to choose from lead to the second reason I picked this- a friend told me she had greatly enjoyed it. Therefore, I began reading with the expectation of having a &quot;nice&quot; read. Other than that, I didn't expect much from the novel.  This is one of the times I am glad to say that I was wrong. &lt;i&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/i&gt; providea, first and foremost a good storyline. A young man, worried that once his youth and beauty departs he will lose everything, wishes that a portrait painted of him bear all reprecussions of time. After a period of time, this young man, Dorian Gray, discovers he has gotten his wish. However, an old maxim proves true once more in this novel: be careful what you wish for, as Gray learns he will, in fact, get what he deserves as a result of a life of debauchery.  Yet an interesting (and certainly unsettling, at least at the time it was written) story line is not all the book has going for it. Wilde provides the reader with three main characters who are well-developed enough to make them convincing. We are given a tempramental artist (another good reason to read this book: anyone with any sort of artistic temprament will greatly appreciate some of the commentary made within the dialogue of the story), who is given to jealousy, a jaded, rather intellectual man who always has an opinon and never hastens to inform those in the vicinity of it, and, finally, a young man who begins the story as a very naive person and changes throughout the book in a seemingly natural manner. A wide variety of smaller characters also help to enhance the plot. In short, this book was one of the most interesting I have ever read. At times, I found myself getting the attention of someone nearby, to point out a line found in one of the passages that I felt they might enjoy or somehow relate to. In one way or another, it is my opinion one would be hard-pressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read.ressed to find someone who did not relate to something the book. Overall, it was an excellent read.
B000002H33|5.0|Okay, buy this album if you like rock or metal, it is as simple as that.  Lyrically this album is up there with &quot;SGT. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, in terms of musicianship, this kicks Lynerd Skynerd's, Grateful Dead's and The Eagle's asses.  Okay, the tempo is fast, very fast, and I know that people into say Bruce Springsteen will not like the tempo speeds at first, but the thought that was put into this album is unbelievable.<br />The album starts off with a 30 second acoustic intro, then it kicks out into thrash metal arena with &quot;BATTERY&quot;, god those guys could manipulate music.  Battery is very catchy and has a laddish approach to it, just listen to the chorus, you will find yourself shouting out BATTERY!!!.<br />Then Master Of Puppets kicks in, now any of you who have heard Fade To Black know that its probably Metallica's best song, their &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; if you will, but Master Of Puppets uses the same elements as &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; but twist it around making this song the best thrash metal song ever made.  It starts out as a heavy and angry song, then it goes all nice and light, then it thrashes out big time.  Then you realise that song was about drugs, and the song shows you the journey and the high with its 5 minute guitar solo, trust me, its not just a guitar solo, its a message.  Damn those boys were clever bastards weren't they!<br />Then &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; slides in, it has an annoying starting and stopping sense to it, much like grunge or Slipknot, it's good, but not headbanging.<br />Sanitariam comes in and in my opinion this is the weakest song on the album, it has an aggressive power to it, and the message its giving off is even more so, but the melody is a little bland.<br />Then we introduce to you Disposable Heroes, god this song is all over the place, and rightfally so.  Its about soldiers running into a battle, tempo changes all over the place, a bridge to die for (literally), this is the cleverest song on the album.<br />Leper Messiah has a great intro, but the melody is a little unstructered.<br />Orion kicks ass.  Live, you probably want to hear &quot;Call Of Ktulu&quot; but this is the best studio instrumental, I just don't know how they do it, they write a 7 minute song on a planet, just like that.<br />The album ends with &quot;Damage Inc.&quot;.  Bad choice, its a good song, but not an album ender, but this album is still one of the best albums ever made!!
0783246641|2.0|Well, if the yuppies who are making thousand or millions of dollars are so stupid and so empty of character as the ones portrayed in this movie, uau, they must be geniuses for being so silly and still marking lots of money.... Anyway, Bale's acting is great, the editing is good, direction is good, but the story sucks.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Although David Fincher's Fight Club, is acclaimed by many critics as an excellent film who's ideas and revolutionary filmmaking may shape the way that movies of the future are made, many people do not like Fight Club.  Violence undoubtedly turned some people off to the movie, however many people who do not like Fight Club, do not dislike the film because of its violence, but rather because these people have an inability to comprehend and/or identify key components of the plot and its underlying themes.  <br />Fight Club has every element that defines a classic movie.  The complex satirical plot is well developed although; it does require an open-minded audience.  The plot is enhanced drastically by a witty and comical dialect.  In order to be an epic film, acting performances must be impeccable, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt both delivered all-star performances and every supporting actor or actress was cast perfectly to fit their parts.  Innovative visual effects were used throughout the film, to enhance the already energetic movie.  Scenes like the one where Edward Norton's character describes the accesorizing of his apartment are unlike any display of effects of the past.  Even the sound was befitting of the film.  The soundtrack does not consist of a lot of big name acts; it merely includes tracks that would go well with certain scenes.  Above anything else it is the motifs, the ideas being presented, and the way in which they are being presented that makes the film the masterpiece that it is. <br /> One of the ideas that Tyler Durden tries to convey to Edward Norton's character throughout the film is the idea that as he puts it, \\"It's only after we've lost everything that we are free to do anything.\\"  Tyler tries to show him that life would be much more valuable if people stopped worrying about the material things that truly don't matter.  Like when he holds a gun to Raymond, the store clerk's head, and tells him that he is going to die.  Raymond really thinks that he is going to be shot.  Then when Tyler tells him that he must get back on the track of being a veterinarian, which Raymond had always dreamed of but given up on, because it was \\"too much school\\", or else he would be killed. Tyler is able to show Edward Norton's character that Raymond's life will be better.  Every breath that he takes will be sweeter than most people can ever imagine.  At this moment in time Raymond won't be thinking about what kind of car he drives or what type of stereo he owns, he will be glad that he is getting a second chance and will live his life to the fullest.<br /> Fight Club has every aspect of a great movie, yet many people do not like this wonderful film.  Fight Club uses beat-em-up and often brutal satire to portray intense ideas, and some viewers may have trouble understanding these ideas.  Fight Club is not for the faint of heart, but rather an audience who is willing to open their mind to the experience of not only watching a great film, but also questioning their own lifestyle.
B000002U82|5.0|Though I know many who will argue in favor of The Wall, it is my opinion that this is the best Pink Floyd album. From the heartbeats to the breathy speech, to chiming clocks and, did i mention wonderful music? The album illustrates that the desperation of everyday life can drive one mad. So if ever you feel a little insane, just turn it up and listen to the lunatics in your hall.
B00005AAFS|4.0|When I first popped this disc into my player I was expecting a continuation of Rammstein's Sehnsucht age. I was wrong. This cd has at least five times the intricity and artistry Sehnsucht or Herzeleid. The guitars are still as tight and heavy, and they now blend flawlessly into the melodies of the keyboards. They even figured out that their distortion pedals can be turned off. Till comes through as hard and heavy as ever. The cd is easily among the most magnificent I've ever heard. And yet, something's missing. The first two albums defined Rammstein, hard, clean, no excess sound. And it was magnificent. This new album has moved beyond those limitations, but to tell the truth I miss the refreshingly clean sound. And another issue I have is that Rammstein's trademark style of socially unaccepted topics has primarily vanished, leaving only Zwitter. Replacing this style is a cold, martial sound leaning heavily on actual serious matters. Despite not being as listenable as Herzeleid or Sehnsucht, the album holds it's own without effort. The new style is truthfully very impressive, the march rhythm in Links 2 3 4 is almost impossible to put out of your head. While the cd rarely lightens up from its brooding sound, this doesn't prove to terrible an issue. From the first track on you become caught up emotionally, even if you don't know the translation. As I said, the elements flow flawlessly into each other, drawing you further into the sound, making you a part of it. Mutter is not the best album for bright, sunny days. Instead, it lends itself more to walks in strong winds and driving rains (personal experience). My recommended tracks are Mein Herz Brennt, Links 2 3 4 (although in German they're saying &quot;Left to 3 4&quot;), Feuer Frei!, Spieluhr (the most stunning Rammstein song ever), and Zwitter (ever hear a German singing &quot;Hermaphrodite&quot; in a falsetto, if not liten to this). So, while it's true I'd more readily listen to Herzeleid, I'd have a near impossible time turning down a chance to listen to this album. You'll leave it feeling as changed as Rammstein's style.
0312243022|3.0|I thought this book did a disservice to Virginia Woolfe by transposing her brilliant and poignant novel (Mrs. Dalloway) onto a modern day plot. Substituting character names, locations, and various major and minor sub-texts (AIDS in place of post-war trauma; a movie star in place of a queen) does not create an original novel (or even a thought-provoking sequel). I don't think you can &quot;cover&quot; literature in the same way you can cover a song.<br />The other two sections of the book, which dealt with the 50's housewife who read Mrs. Dalloway, and the fictional account of V. Woolfe writing the novel, were much more enjoyable and well done.
B00004W3MS|2.0|I have been a fan of so-called &quot;ethereal&quot; for over 30 years: from the psychedelic folk-rock of Country Joe and the Fish to the intelligent post punk &quot;gothic&quot; of the early Cocteau Twins to the brilliant Bardo Pond of the present. Nevertheless, having my hopes raised by the music press praises with comparison's to &quot;God's tears&quot; and called &quot;Ineffably beautiful&quot;, upon listening Sigur Ros in reality seems to me to be quite overrated - occasionally bordering on puerile. <br />Some of the songs have elements of emotional propulsion, but the majority are formulaic soundtracks. Many songs are embellished with string orchestrations similar to &quot;romantic&quot; songs by Lawrence Welk or the Boston Pops. Sigur Ros' music is far closer to overproduced, predictable  &quot;commercial&quot; sound of Enya than to the intelligent, engaging drones of Labradford. If you like your music easily digested as background mood musak buy it. If you need real &quot;ineffable&quot;, ethereal beauty, try Labradford, Cocteau Twins, Lisa Gerrard, Bardo Pond or even the latest Shipping News (to name a few).
B00004Z311|5.0|i remember this movie wwaaaay back in the day when i was kid (im 23 now).  i totally remember the scene where jack 1st meets gump and gump asks him a riddle. i dont remember the riddle but the answer was honeycup or some kind of flower like that, and gump proceeds to stomp on his little harp.  i recently saw the movie and this scene was gone, whats up with that!
0446677450|4.0|First, I've read this book several times and want to correct an untruth.  Mr. Kiyosaki never states that the poor deserve to be poor, but that we are all accountable for our own actions and education.  This book is not a &quot;how-to&quot; guide on how to become wealthy.  It is a great story about this man's two fathers (one father was his friend's father) and how their *WAY OF THINKING* and set of actions made all the difference in the world.  His wealth-building tactics do NOT take advantage of the poor, only the close-minded.  This book is a great book in creating a paradigm shift, to question our beliefs about money, and why the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor.  I don't subscribe to all of his theories or beliefs, but I do concur with the author that we are all accountable for our own wealty and happiness.  I grew up in a very poor neighborhood, had a rough childhood, but once I decided to read, to learn, and to take action, I have created a lifestyle that I never would have imagined.  This book really is a gateway to learning more about how money works, to increase &quot;your financial intelligence&quot;, and to realize that the road to wealth is a continuous education.
6305137293|3.0|This is a real bargain-buy! Halloween II is a rather rare movie,and for less than ten bucks you get a quite good dvd version of it. Letterboxed and with good sound and picture quality. Many people here complain about the lack of extras, but does all movies have to come in a 2-disc limited edition set? Others compare it to the original, and of course this movie is not that sort of all-time classic. Anyway, I think Halloween II is one of the best horror-sequels ever. It holds more than enough scares to keep you on the edge of your seat for 90 minutes. Buy it !
B00005AXEL|5.0|I raced to Wallyworld first thing this morning to get a copy of &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;! I was not disapointed, this is the best Stevie Nicks CD since Bella Donna. Every song is a winner, Candlebright and Too Far from Texas are my favorites. Planets of the Universe, Trouble in Shangri-la, Every Day, and Bombay Sapphires are all great too. You will love this CD, buy it right away!
6303481272|5.0|Remarkable film, set in medievil Japan, dealing with vagabond ninja named Jubei who crosses swords against the eight demons of the Shogun of the Dark. What results is an absolutely stunning visual feast of action, swordfighting, character study and mysticism with results that far exceed many American animated films.
B000002I2M|5.0|This is the most recent Doors album that I have bought, and it the best Doors album I have ever bought.  It is packed full of bluesy, rough, coarse songs that sound like they come from the Roadhouse.  Morrison's voice is as aggressive and sexy as ever, Manzarek's keyboard skills surface more than anything, Krieger's guitar playing is through the roof, the bassist's work is pumped and ready to rock, and John Densmore is playing his best, also.  It kicks off with &quot;The Changeling&quot;, a very catchy song with awesome vocals and keyboard work. Then comes &quot;Love Her Madly&quot;, which seems to be a return to the Doors' roots of songs such as &quot;Hello I Love You&quot; and &quot;Twentieth Century Fox&quot;, where Jim's voice sounds like its out of their first album.  The title track is decent, but there are far better tracks on it.  &quot;L'America&quot; is an example of a how poetic Jim Morrison is. Then &quot;Crawling King Snake&quot;, which has an unforgetable riff combined with Densmore's marchy drumming style.  It is definitely psychedelic.  Then comes &quot;The WASP&quot;, which is ABSOLUTELY PURE POETRY from Jim Morrison.  It is like a poetry reading at a club.  The album finishes with the soothing and calm &quot;Riders On the Storm&quot;.  <br />But, this album captures the Doors at their best, doing psychedelia, blues, rock and roll, jazzy, and they go back to their roots.  It one hell of a way to end the career of the Doors; I don't think they could have gotten anymore.  Buy it if you like what you've heard from me.
B00003CX8I|4.0|Coming from the director of The Usual Suspects and Apt Pupil,one would partake the same director dredging up an adaptation of a famously known comic book to be a bizzaire career choice.But,alas to say,the movie adaptation of the Marvel comics classic is a highly absorbing Sci-Fi Fantasy film indeed.The special effects are rip-roaring,and the characters,such as Wolverine,Rogue ,Storm and Lizard are intelligently conceived and well portrayed.The superb Patrick Stewart shines as the benevolent Dr.Xavier ,and the film wisely doesn't overdo itself at a wise running time of 90 minutes.Another one to catch on a widescreen TV with a powerful speaker system.
B00003CXPC|4.0|I'd give this 4.5 if I could - but realistically. Why only four stars? It's a great and inspirational video, but they could have slipped in a few more intelligent words rather than mere swears (It's so funny to hear the English swear in this movie). It's so hard to put words out - why can't you merely dance them out? <br />It's beautifully done. It has the English 'spot' in it. The withering 'Cup of Tea' style, I get that snuffy posh feeling when I hear them speak, yet it's amazing how this video thrives with talent. It's dashing, compelling, and imaginative! It breaks the stereotypes of what males/females should really be doing in life! <br />And most of all, is the family situation in the movie. The phrase 'So close, yet so far away' comes to mind. How 'radical'.<br />I was amazed how throughout the whole movie, Billy still stayed the same, and when asked about how he feels when dancing, you can touch with the character still unsure in him.<br />I admire Billy Elliot. The movie itself isn't perfect, but the qualities of it stand out so well, you can't help but find a place for it in your video library.
0679736646|5.0|Like most of Philip K. Dick (PKD) books, Ubik is very hard to describe let alone categorize.  But here goes!<br />Ubik is a futuristic story of time travel, space travel, big business and a slap at American consumerism.  It's best not to be obsessed with the science fiction elements, which are a bit far-fetched, but rather to relish in PKD's brutal view consumerism and capitalism.  American readers over 40 will find the many little commercial sound-bites on 'Ubik' (..a spray with remarkable restorative properties) to be a delightful (and sinister) throw back to the cheesy TV commercials of the 1960s.<br />...but please remember that as with most PKD novels Ubik is rather hard to understand fully, and is more than a little bizarre.  But PKD's satire rings through - it's the best of several PKD novels I've read.<br />Bottom line: weird, wonderful and very original.  Don't think too much while reading it; just flow with it.
0140186409|4.0|After being assigned a novel project in Language Arts, I decided to read The Grapes of Wrath. This book is about a family, the Joads. They get kicked off their land and set out to California to look for a job. During this book you follow the Joads journey to California. They have to go through many obstacles on their way to California. As you read this book you will learn about the things that they have to go through. They have determination, and are very brave people. This book was a good book but sad because of all the thing that the Joads had to go through, and how hard that it would have been to live back then in the Great Depression. If you are looking for a good book to read about the past I recommend The Grapes of Wrath.
B00000JMQC|5.0|I bought this movie the other day cause i love Fantasy and i am satisified with it. Dorothy ( Fariuza Balk) goes back to Oz and finds it a disaster area, she meets new friends and must rescue the kingdom from a evil worse than the Wicked Witch of the west. good-acting, a well-written script and lots of fun that makes this a Trip that you and your kids would love.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks is back with her best album since &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. That classic album was released twenty years ago. Since that time Stevie has put out some other great solo albums, &quot;The Wild Heart&quot; and &quot;The Other Side Of The Mirror&quot; and some not so great albums, &quot;Rock A Little&quot; and &quot;Street Angel&quot;. &quot;Street Angel&quot; was the last solo album we got from Stevie in 1994. That album had Stevie adrift musically. Personal problems led to the album being a less than stellar effort. By Stevie's own admission, it's not her best work. Well, now signed to a new record label, Stevie is back with her personal demons behind her and has found &quot;Trouble In Shangri-La&quot;. &quot;Trouble&quot; is anything but. Where &quot;Bella Donna&quot; was recorded by a wide eyed girl heading into the wild world of Rock and Roll, &quot;Trouble&quot; is the same girl, now 20 years older and much wiser on the other side. As with &quot;Bella Donna&quot; Stevie has included songs from her very start in the business back in the early 70's. &quot;Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;Candlebright&quot; both date back to the &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; days. The classic track &quot;Planets Of The Universe&quot; previously known to long time fans as &quot;No Light&quot; is here as well. These classics fit in perfectly right along side the newer tracks. There is not a weak track to be heard here and although Stevie's voice has matured and lowered fans WILL NOT be disappointed with this one.   Stevie has grown as a writer, as a performer and as a woman since &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. The girl on &quot;Bella Donna&quot; would not have been able to pull off the songs on &quot;Trouble&quot; and make them sound believeable. Like Dorothy in &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot; she needed to travel that rocky brick road and discover the pitfalls along the way for herself. Stevie has come back from Oz and has quite a story to tell.   The whole album is just one classic after another. &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; rocks harder than anything Stevie's ever done. &quot;Bombay Sapphires&quot; is classic Stevie. The title track ranks up there with Stevie's previous epic title tracks. To close the album Stevie does as she has with her previous albums and leaves us with a rock and roll lullabye, &quot;Love Is&quot; with Sarah McLachlan on piano and background vocals. Macy Gray, Natalie Maines, Lindsey Buckingham and Sheryl Crow also all make appearences.   Stevie is back and better than ever. This album is everything you've always loved about Stevie &quot;and so much more&quot;. She has retained her classic style while at the same time updated it. An instant classic!!!
B000059Z8J|5.0|This &quot;special edition&quot; DVD was worth the wait.  In my opinion, the movie is a classic by virtue of its cast, screenplay, score and innovative special effects.  The movie is almost perfect in modernizing the Superman story but retaining the central elements of the characters.  But the DVD package itself is stellar.  First of all, the movie has been fully restored, as opposed to the faded images seen on VHS and even on television.  It looks as good as it did the first time I saw it at the movie theater.  It also includes several great new scenes, particularly of Superman and Jor-El.  I also liked the screen tests.  Of all the DVD's I've bought or rented, this one is the best.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I can't get enough of Stevie's amazing new album.  This is one of those albums that you can play all the way through over and over again and there is not one song that you'd even want to skip over.  Definitely one of her best.  The Queen of Rock is back on top...
B000059R8Y|5.0|Eric Clapton's Reptile is a wonderful blues experience! The Impressions add so much to the whole album with their &quot;Do Waaas&quot; and beautiful harmonies.  My personal favorites are &quot;Got you on my Mind&quot; and &quot;Broken Down&quot;.  Even my father at the age of 71 thought the album great too! EC's music is aging nicely with all of us fans who have been following him since the 60's. This one is the best of the the best.
0767824571|5.0|Given all that we know about the legends of King Arthur, the Holy Grail, and Knights Who Say Ni, it's about time someone crammed them all together in one movie. Not to mention some very nice shrubbery. Well, back in 1975, the lunatics that were Monty Python decided to destory any credibility these legends might have.<br />This brilliant farce is the stuff of legend itself. What with Wizards called Tim, killer bunny rabbits, and one knight that just doesn't know when to quit.<br />If you've never seen this film, shame on you. It should be required viewing for every member of the human race.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I've been reading the reviews here and decided to try and hit the 1000 mark with my deathless prose. I've been watching movies on the big screen for over 50 years now (don't ask!) and this is a masterpiece.  Gladiator combines the sweeping lyrical vision of Ridley Scott with the powerful, emotion-packed acting of Russell Crowe, surrounded by a stellar cast and set in an awe-inspiring visual panorama.    While Gladiator may not be perfect (there are some 'over the top' moments that jar) it's combination of heroic story, beautiful pictures and emotional score just sweep you along.  Those who carp on historical accuracy have to admit that this is fiction, not a documentary.  However, you cannot fault the beauty of this production.  Nowhere are you jolted out of the period!  While the script is spare, the sentiments expressed speak to the human heart.  That's why so many are so taken with this film.  The themes of nobility, dignity, honesty and love of family and country are timeless - as well as seen so rarely in modern films.<br />Russell Crowe is truly the best actor working today.  His emotional center holds this film together from pensive start to inevitable denouement.  He is Maximus, with never a false note. When you start to see this again, and you will want to, watch for the 30 minutes in the heart of the story where Maximus says NOTHING!  The story is being told by this amazing actor without him saying a word.   The splendid supporting cast and attention to accurate visual details take us on the personal journey of a moral man, without preaching a belief or pandering to the lowest intelligence of the audience.<br />I've seen this on the big screen numerous times, where it deserves to be seen, but if you must only see it at home, please get the dvd.  Get a player for this if you don't have one!  The beauty of this film will be appreciated for a long time.  There was no greater justice than Gladiator being named best film of 2000 and the equal tribute to the talent of Russell Crowe, best actor of 2000.  <br />But the greatest injustice was leaving Ridley Scott empty handed at awards time - this is his masterpiece, and will be remembered as such. It seems obvious at first glance that this film will be enjoyed by men and boys, but Dreamworks and Universal missed the mark by not convincing women to see it too.  It is NOT too violent, it is a very emotional ride that will entrance most women by the power of the love and devotion expressed by the lead characters.<br />While the script has not been universally admired, I find it vindicating to see how much of the simple and noble sentiments of this story have entered modern idiom: &quot;Strength and Honor&quot;, &quot;At my signal, unleash hell&quot;, and &quot;What we do in life, echoes in eternity.&quot;  That, my friends, is the sign of a classic flick.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Just finished watching the disc, including ALL of its features. The disc has 2 sides(which, by the way, are very hard to distinguish from one another as the disc has no label-one must be nearsighted to read what the lettering on the disc says) &amp; includes the film (with added &amp; mostly unseen footage), the directors commentary (with director Richard Donner &amp; writer Tom Mankewicz-did I spell that right?), 3 very interesting documentaries about the making of the film, trailers, &amp; the soundtrack.<br />I for one do not read comic books &amp; do not generally enjoy comic book movies but SUPERMAN I &amp; II are among my favorite films becuase, unlike X-MEN or BATMAN, they were poignant &amp; had heart. I recommend buying copies of I &amp; II since they were so excellent but not III or IV which were so very AWFUL (by the way, how unusual is it for I &amp; II, among the best films ever made, to be followed up by III &amp; IV, among the worst films ever made?)!
0783227019|4.0|This movie is like a toned down version of another Al Pachino and Brian De Palma movie Scarface. Pachino is brilliant as usual and there are strong performances by John Leguizamo and especially Sean Penn.<br />After being in Jail for 5 years Carlito Brigante is out of jail and has one dream. To get enough money to move away from the streets and into paradise. But when his friend David gets in trouble with a gangster Carlito has to do one more job before getting out.<br />This role was just written for Pachino and is very underated. A must for all gangster film fans!!
B0000508U6|5.0|Parachutes is a brilliant album. It is an eclectic mix of songs and could only really be classified as being `alternative', but nevertheless it masterfully combines elements of rock and pop. Parachutes takes the listener on a journey through a number of emotions, which are heightened by the band's excellent use of guitar feedback, piano, synthesisers, different instruments and above all, the strong vocals of singer Chris Martin. It starts with the haunting melody of `Don't Panic' to the easy beat of `Yellow' and finishes on a mellow and inspirational note with the piano driven `Everything's Not Lost'. Ultimately this is an album that is guaranteed to satisfy due to it's overall musical brilliance. <br />Five out of five for sure!!
B00005B6C9|5.0|I usually listen to edgier stuff, like Elliott Smith, Elastica and Garbage, but I confess that I have always liked the Bee Gees songs that made the charts. Well, I watched that special on A&amp;E a few nights ago and I was AMAZED at their songwriting talent. They have written hits for Dolly Parton, Dionne Warwick...many songs that I had no idea were penned by them! So I ran right out and bought this album... I am happy to say that the recording and arrangements are beautifully done, and it gives me so much joy to hear an old band like this still creating such thoughtful and inventive stuff. &quot;This is Where I Came In&quot; is a great song all around (MORE acoustic next time, Bee Gees!!!!) and definitely ranks up there with some of the best music being done today. The first five tracks are all great. Some of the schmaltzier stuff (&quot;Wedding Day&quot;) makes me a little twitchy, but the tunes are interesting and carefully crafted, and you have to remember that the BeeGees have always been known for romantic ballads like this. Overall, I consider this CD a sublime achievement from one of rock's (in my mind) most  prolific, underrated and creative groups.
B0000508U6|5.0|I can't even say in words how great this CD is. The lyrics, the sound, the music... it all fits together extremely well. It is a very mellow album and it is so relaxing. Highlight singles include the single &quot;Yellow&quot; which I'm sure everyone knows already. You may ask if you only know &quot;Yellow&quot;: Do the rest of the songs sound like &quot;Yellow&quot;? The answer to that question is yes, they are all in the same style as &quot;Yellow&quot; yet they are diverse enough where you don't think every song sounds the same.&quot;Don't Panic&quot; is instantly captivating and addicting. You'll want to listen to it over and over. Second single &quot;Shiver&quot; is more upbeat than &quot;Yellow&quot; but still keeps with the overall mellow theme of the album. Another highlight is the piano-ballad &quot;Trouble&quot;  This is a must buy! If you get it and you like it, a similar album is &quot;The Man Who&quot; by Travis.
B00000BKDS|5.0|Dynamite, original Iron Maiden,all 9 tracs wonderfully done, killer lightning speed bass on Sanctuary, Phantom of the Opera, Transylvania, and Iron maiden, wonerful guitarist as well with great drumming, and vox, dont waist ur time get the album now. Up the Irons!!!!
B00003CX95|5.0|Although described by critics as a historically inaccurate and profusely gory film, the writers of Braveheart have created a script that appeals to many sensibilities.  Braveheart is a well rounded-film.  The film caters to a wide variety of spectators through its depiction of love, patriotism, battle scenes and comedy.    The film has the theme of love for all the people who are into the sappy stuff.  William Wallace, the hero of the film, wants to find a wife and settle down in the lands of Scotland.  He develops a love for a local woman.  While attending the funeral of his father and brother, Wallace is given a flower by a darling little girl.  Wallace goes away for an extended time where he grows to be a muscular, devilishly cunning, battle ready and incredibly handsome man.  When he returns to his village after living with his uncle, he searches for the flower girl.  He finds her at a  local dance and begins to court her.  He eventually shows her the flower and they fall in love.  It wasn't quite that simple, but you get the point.  The two decide to get married after a rather cheesy but romantic proposal made by Wallace.  They have a great but short time together because this love story falls short when a local lord finds out about the marriage and spoils the fun for the love birds.  Wallace's wife is slain leaving him with a broken heart.   If the first love scene wasn't enough, we get to see him successfully court another woman who goes by the name of Princess....yes, Princess, Isabella.  Throughout the movie  Andolsen-2 Isabella hears of Wallace and grows fond of his success stories.  She romanticizes his character and develops the urge to help Wallace in his campaign to free Scotland of the English.  When the two meet up sparks fly.  She reminds Wallace of his lost wife and she, having the hormones of a teenage boy laced with a rather overly romanticized ideal of Wallace, finds him unbearably attractive.  In the defense of the Princess, Wallace did deliverto his reputation when they met.  I mean, he knew three languages! and he was muscular and sweaty.  What else could a Princess ask for?  She sticks by his side all the way up unto his death.  Now isn't that sweet?  So I maintain that if a person can get passed the blood and guts, this is a great love story film.  But it isn't just love that makes it great.  The movie revolves around patriotism.  Wallace is determined to rid Scotland of the ruthless English and their Kind Longshanks for the freedom of the Scotts.  Wallace gives us a character to love.  He devotes himself fully to his country.  As Americans, who can ask for a better character?  He throws out great lines and delivers devastatingly perfect speaches to rally the \\"Sons of Scotland\\" into battle.  He leads attacks, defies kings, loves Princesses, waves around a huge sword a lot, and for what?  His country!  Well, it wasn't like that at first.  He didn't really seem to care much about the country until his wife died.  But after that he went full bore for Scotland, hey, everybody needs a start right?  Aside from Wallace's minor set back, you really find out what devotion to ones country is like after viewing this film.    Another aspect of the movie that made it as great as it is were the battle scenes.  No matter how many times you see them, they never stop being the most awesome to  Andolsen-3 have ever been captured on film.  These scenes leave a lasting effect on anybody who watches them.  I am not pro blood sports or anything, but this movie takes the cake when it comes to movies with battle scenes in it... well, ok, Saving Private Ryan had some good stuff too.  There are two main battles, and one partial, that are shown throughout the movie, so its not overwhelming for the squeamish and other viewers.  But their effect is defiantly felt for all those viewers who crave realistic battle scenes.  All in all, you can't find much better than this.    The movie is traumatic.  Wallace loses his wife to savages which breaks his heart, and there are battles in which Wallace breaks other peoples hearts... literally.  This can leave a viewer feeling a little grim.  That's where the crazed Irishman comes into play.  Not to say other characters didn't have their moments,  but if you like to laugh, this guy can make you do it.  He was funny and his timing was always perfect.  Before the first battle he eases up the tension with some comic dialogue with Wallace.  After he saves Wallace's life from an attempted assassination, he laughs it off and says how he didn't like the guy he killed anyway.  This guy is sure to be a classic comic relief.    To sum up, this film has it all.  It is a movie that can be watched, and liked, by a variety of viewers.  Braveheart does not cater to a single type of viewer but cumulates several different aspects to create a great movie.  No matter what type of movie-goer you are, you will find something in this movie that you like.  And if you don't, something is wrong with you.  And on a closing note, don't listen to people who say the movie is or isn't historically accurate because its both!  The only way to find out the truth is to do the research yourself.
6304509154|4.0|Excellent GHOST film works mainly becuz  of f/x and refreshing directing by horror legend Tobe Hooper. Although a bit of Spielberg is noticing at times, if it werent for the opening credits where they plaster his name on just about every credit that u could possibly think of, there's NO way that any Tom, Dick, and Harry would ever notice that he had anything to do with this masterpiece. Its paced like a roller coaster. It never gets boring from start to finish. That's an HONOR! Kudos to Spielberg for fleshing out such a vivid and imaginative screenplay. Guess some of that JAWS notoriety rubbed off and his head inflated to the size of the Goodyear Blimp. Anyway, the film is scary in every aspect. Although i was surprised that a film with such gore could somehow slide underneath MPAA raters and snag a PG rating. Wow. They musta been thinkin...Hey if Spielberg has this film under HIS belt...why not try to make another JAWS! Except this time use Ghosts and Better f/x to better the monster. Well ladies and gents, this sure as heck isnt JAWS. Yet still credible in every sense of word and feeling. Frightening at times and hysterical at others. A MUST SEE for movie Buffs like me and my pal Allie&gt; Huh?
B00005AXEL|5.0|Who said you can't teach an old dog new tricks? Many critics had written her off years ago as washed up and as frozen in the 80s.  With this new masterpiece, Nicks has proven just how versatile she can be.  She bridged the gap between the music of her &quot;time&quot; (the 70s and 80s) with that of the present day by teaming up with popular, TALENTED musicians of today (ala Santana).  While this successful strategy was ever so present in Santana's &quot;Supernatural&quot; (as one could notice the different vocals singing, and the completely different styles), make no mistake, this IS Nick's album.  It has her legendary trademark touch all over it.  It is almost as if these other musicians (Crow, et al.) were there only for support and to build Nicks' confidence, just like a father teaching a son to ride a bike, and then one day, let's go without the child knowing he is riding all by himself.        Even for non-fans, this album should be a MUST-HAVE!  The music is memorable (i.e., one could remember the tune and hum to it 5 hours after hearing it) and well-written.  The album establishes an almost pacific mood that further drifts one away with dreamily played guitar work.       What passes for talent these days, sadly, is the fact that Britney Spears ACTUALLY co-WROTE ONE SONG ON HER LATEST ALBUM!!  With &quot;music&quot; being so artificial nowadays, TISL brings a breath a fresh air, and a glimmer of hope for the music industry.
B00000J2KY|5.0|Lolita by far is one of the morally saddest and depressing fims of all time. But somehow...it has been pulled of. Stanley Kubrick directed this masterpiece of Dysfunctional Family Problems in 1962. Now being as im rather young...doesnt mean that i was unable to enjoy and appreciate this work of art. It is at times rather slow, and tedious, but hey! Its a Kubrick Film! All of his films were overlong, and many over-rated!  But this is a true piece of American Art! Never should be forgotten by the public nor everyday film goers. Kudos to Kubrick for making such a controversial book into an equally satisfying film in the earlier 60's!
B000000W5L|4.0|Ok, so I did write an earlier review and did not like the album. Time passes, and although Tatoo You (among others) ranks higher on my list, this album is a good one. Tumbling Dice, Rocks Off, and Happy are classics. Much of the album is blues/gospel/50's style rock, and other styles mixed in. It is different from what the Stones did before and since. This one would be worth it, but only after you have integrated your self into more mainstream Stones material. It may take several listens and a couple of days, months, or even in my case, years. It does deserve it's classic repuration. I do disagree, however, that this is the last of the Rolling Stone's so called &quot;best&quot; (insert material, years, creativity, etc.) whatever.... They did good before and since then. Rock on and get back on the road and recording you guys.
B000002G23|5.0|Greatest Hits albums always show you the shining moments of each band, often while leaving out some of the bands' own favorite songs, in favor of the commercial hits.  This is a complete portfolio, warts and all, that demonstrates the evolution of the band as musicians, songwriters, and people.  True fans will appreciate this aspect as much as the songs themselves.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's game is a VERY well written book about a six-year old prodigy who is selected by the government to become a soldier. Though he is an outcast at school, he excels in his new home where a series of games are designed to teach the children how to fight a war against the mysterious &quot;Buggers&quot;. As Ender and his friends begin the fight, they face trials beyond anything they could have imagined in their old, mundane homes on earth.<br />  Attacks on the plot are very much unfounded. There ARE six-year old geniuses. Many of them grow up playing chess and become grandmasters. Some work on mathematics, though these people typically lose much of their talent as they grow older. Many focus on music. It is not outlandish to think that child prodigies could be turned into soldiers, if they were made to focus on that subject.<br />  As the book goes on the differences between civilian and military life are made clear to the reader. The tactics and strategies that Ender uses are all believable and powerful. The characters, for the most part, are very good. Yet a serious knock on the book remains that removes the book from a fifth star-Ender's intelligence is often variable. Some problems exist on the school (which is deep in outer space) that make it obvious that the school is not what it appears. Though these problems are later explained away, it appears that Ender did not catch them immediately. If Ender was so intelligent (he took physics and trig. when he was six) why did he not realize that something was amiss? For someone who took physics (or, indeed, had basic logic at his command) why would he not have noticed these obvious problems with the station? Ender also does not realize that the &quot;game&quot; he plays is actually real, and not a simple simulation.<br />  This flaw prevents Ender's Game from becoming the classic that it really should be. Nonetheless, it is an excellent book that definitely deserves serious attention, and should be read by anyone even remotely interested in Science Fiction or Military Tactics.
B00005AXEL|3.0|I was thirteen when &quot;Rumors&quot; was released and immediately fell under the collective spell of Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood Macs' success was the sum total of five talented individuals contributing to the whole. No one benefited more artistically from the collaboration than Stevie Nicks. And the band couldn't have benefited more from the emotional heart Nicks provided that defined the bands feel-- and yes, the visual--Nicks was the ultimate California Girl. Lindsey Buckingham was able to take Nicks cryptic internal landscapes and make them interesting and coherent thus giving birth to such classics as &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;Landslide&quot;. Convinced she was a rock and roller versus an aucoustic act, Nicks suffered from Big 80's synth and guitar heavy arrangements weighing down her songs and rendering them mostly indistinguishable from one another. Her solo work provided some hits (the rocking &quot;Stand Back&quot;) but many more misses culminating with the disastrous &quot;Street Angel&quot;. <br />Nicks is back with her new CD &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot; and her new collection of producers do their best to bring sparkle back to Nicks' material. Tracks 2,3,and 4 harken back to Nicks big 80's dense sounds and don't do much for getting the CD off the ground. Things take a turn for the better at Track 5 which shows Nicks at her best--the song &quot;Every Day&quot; is one of the CD's best . &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; with Dixie Chicks Natalie Maines is the best collaboration here and its country leanings is one Nicks should pursue more. The best track though is &quot;I Miss You&quot; which allows Nicks' sensitive voice room for maximum effect with its acoustic based arrangement. There are few artists with the stunning longevity afforded Nicks and she certainly deserves it. While her solo work pales when put up against her best with Fleetwood Mac, her earnest and very sincere compassion that comes through is more than enough compensation for what islacking.
0783229321|1.0|This has got to be the most-OVERRATED comedies of all time,I have no idea why everyone haved been raving about this silly SO-CALLED CULT-CLASSIC,sure that's what i expect from a movie like this and i do enjoy the genre,but the cookie-cutter script just frankly lacks BREAK-AWAY humor and the humor is too dull for my taste,I'll go with PORKYS,FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT or REVENGE of the NERDS anyday!! not to mention the LACK-LUSTER transfer of the DVD.
B000000W6F|5.0|I remember catching the video for &quot;Siva&quot; latenight on MTV back in late '91 or early '92, and just sitting there, stunned, by what I was hearing.  &quot;Gish&quot; has turned out to be my all time favorite album, and even though I haved loved most of the Pumpkins' stuff since, they were unable to surpass the shocking originality of this CD.  It makes you race, then slow, then race again, and you just loose yourself in a myriad of guitars with a raw edge, or putting out 60's-like psychedelic riffs, or taking you of into dreamland.  &quot;I Am One&quot; grabs you, and the rest of the tracks never let you go.   I'm online now buying yet another copy because I keep wearing them out (or stepping on them, or someone sets the b on it and scratches it -- you know how it goes).
0393320928|5.0|Review of Richard P. Feynman's &quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot;<br /> The novel &quot;What Do You Care What Other People Think?&quot; by Richard P. Feynman is an outstanding book about a curious physicist.  The novel's title comes from Feynman's attitude of standing up and saying what is on his mind. He tries to persuade that idea to his future wife Arlene, who always watches what she says and is careful not to offend anyone.  Arlene would also tease Richard with that line when she  sent out greeting cards with her name and his nickname, &quot;Putsy&quot; on them.  Feynman  would be ashamed of that name and Arlene would use that line against him.  This book is about a remarkable journey through the life and times of Richard Feynman.  It details a tragic loss in his life, but also great accomplishments.  Funny stories of  booking a hotel, impressive speeches where people brag about shaking his hand, and Feynman being called a sexist pig will have you laughing out loud.

B000059MEK|5.0|Okay, I know what most hardcore techno-heads are thinking if they're reading this...&quot;Oh, Daft Punk is commercialized techno/house, they're not that good.&quot;  That's a pity, because I didn't write this review for them anyway (slight evil laughter).  This is for those who are hooked on the album's first single, &quot;One More Time&quot;, or the second single, &quot;Aerodynamic.&quot;  This is, first and foremost, a quality album.  This is an album you'll like for the great music, with its body-shakin' beats, infectious melodies and stellar grooves.  But forget all that for a second, because this is one of the few albums that I own that I felt like I got my ... worth.  And that's rare.  Not only are the album songs excellent (check out &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; or &quot;Face To Face&quot;), but you get free membership to Daft Punk's new internet music service, the DaftClub.  New songs every week or two that build on and expand the album's scope...highly innovative, not to mention cool.  So go and buy it, and while you're at it, go buy &quot;Homework&quot; too.  Both are well worth your hard-earned cash, and trust me on this.<br />Oh, and I can't resist it...sorry, folks, but this has to be done.<br />ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US.  :o)
B000059Z8J|5.0|The producers of this DVD know how to get the most out of the digital medium.  Watching the opening credits fly by with impact effects got my pulse rate up.  Outstanding job of transferring this classic movie from film to DVD.  <br />Now, I'm looking forward to the day when this is done to the original Star Wars films.  Maybe in the next century?   :-)

And Lehane.....well, I can't wait to go and read every single one of his other books now. I can't remember another author who so richly develops the voice and personality of his characters...I'm just thrilled that this is a series, so I can enjoy more the brilliant dialogue and plot. If you enjoy mysteries or just great writing...you'll love Dennis Lehane.

Taking the best of Rio and adding the best of the rest of Duran Duran's efforts can only be a winner.
6305252521|5.0|Few People have identified what the Truman Show is really about: a man that is true to himself in spite of the distractions and lies of his false micro-world. Get it? True-man?<br />The creator (no capital &quot;c&quot;) of Truman's micro universe artfully calls himself Christof- christ is Greek for &quot;annointed&quot; folks. <br />The false nature of Truman's universe pokes some real fun at hollywood, for nobody really knows how to drive a bus, to practice medicine, heck, when they're searching for Truman the actors don't even know how to have a search party, they link arms and walk through the streets- Everything is based on its appeal to the camera and nothing has any substance and ergo little to do with the real world.<br />But something is out there and Truman begins to suspect.<br />As Truman embraces his true self, his explorer self, the part that is stiffled by his false universe, Christof tries to lure him back by having the audacity to present himself as a voice from the heavens. Something that would have great influence on any of us. But the producer is not really God, and the whole cardhouse falls down right then: for the first time in the film, The Girl raises her eyes to heaven and pray's to God &quot;please&quot; at about the time Christof blasphemes &quot;we're on geedee television&quot;. It's clear then that there is a real God and Christof ain't Him. <br />Truman is then brave enough to embrace the unknown True World, having identified and shunned the false universe, the false values, and the lower-case-c-creator of his micro universe.<br />A brilliant film
B00005JG6R|5.0|Let me clarify that: I am not talking about the soft-core porno-violence that defines a lot of modern anime and manga. Rather, I'm speaking to the idea that Akira is a mature, intelligent film, written, animated and meant for mature, intelligent audiences -- the sort of people who understand that you have to eat your veggies before you get to have your ice cream. Akira is a substantial &quot;meal&quot; of a film, and it makes practically every other animated film (the Disney studio's &quot;product&quot; films in particular) seem about as nutritious as a candy bar. Not that there's anything wrong with that; it's just that sometimes you want a little bit more than bad &quot;feel-good&quot; rewrites of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Victor Hugo, you know what I mean? Akira serves that need quite well. Set in 21st-century Neo-Tokyo, &quot;31 years after World War III&quot;, the film is a twisting, turning, dark and feverish science-fantasy story. The characters are intelligently-created, the symbolism and subtext are thought-provoking but not intrusive; the story is absolutely riveting; and the animation itself is some of the best (if not the best) I've ever seen.<br />One of the best things about Akira is that it is not simplistic in terms of story -- plots and subplots abound here, not so much so as to confuse an attentive viewer, but definitely far more complex than 99% of the other animated films out there. On one side we have the gang of biker punks led by Kaneda and Yamagata, and the sensitive depiction of Kaneda's abrasive/protective relationship with young Tetsuo, whose tortured heart and love/hate for Kaneda radiate from every frame he's in. On the other side is the nameless Colonel (whose mannerisms and speech suggest the legendary Toshiro Mifune, and I don't think that's accidental), in charge of Neo-Tokyo security, head of the secret &quot;Akira&quot; project, embroiled in the City Council's endless backbiting and politicking. There are also saboteur rebels, traitors on the Council, and three &quot;children&quot;, holdovers from the first Akira project, who hold the key to the entire film.<br />The movie unfolds beautifully, combining action, character and theme so subtly, there are times you hardly notice it being done -- another sign that this is not your average animation. From the dramatic yet mysterious opening, to the enthralling battle between Kaneda's gang and the villanous &quot;Clowns&quot;, your attention is captured -- not to mention your imagination. Then a subplot involving rebels Kei and Ryu, and one of the child-humanoids, is slowly introduced, then suddenly interwoven with Tetsuo's story -- and if you haven't already been hooked, you will be. The story, which covers all its bases quite well, then goes on to involve Kaneda's search for his missing friend with Kei and Ryu's plot to kidnap one of the Akira test subjects; also interwoven are the three children with Tetsuo's newly-engineered psychic abilities. He rapidly becomes addicted to them, then corrupted by them; his already-unstable personality disintegrates and he goes mad. (A key illustration of this comes late in the film: Tetsuo's mechanical arm, which he fashions with his powers after losing his flesh-and-blood limb. The filmmakers are making the point here that Tetsuo is losing his humanity, becoming a thing instead of a person. It's a bit of symbolism which in other hands would be clumsy and obvious, but which here works so well and seamlessly you absorb it without noticing.) As the apocalyptic ending comes about, the characters and stories have all become intertwined, and nothing is left forgotten or unclear -- although it may take you two or three viewings to get the full effect. And when Akira finally emerges, after haunting the entire film like a Japanese Rebecca (not an inapt analogy, by the way, as Tetsuo continually is compared to the departed Akira), the moment is, in terms of what has gone before, the linchpin of the entire film.<br />A few final notes: Much has been made by critics of this film's high violence content -- if you want my honest opinion, they're full of it. Akira is no more violent than a film like Predator or Dawn of the Dead; it's just that, as Americans raised on the cartoons-are-for-kids notion (implanted in our minds mostly by Disney and Saturday morning television), we are unused to seeing such a high level of violent action in animation. But in Japan and Europe, where animation and cartooning are taken seriously as an art form, stuff like this is meant for adults, not kids. My point being, once again, that this is not a cutesy-pie kids flick, and you should not, repeat NOT, allow your kids to watch it until and unless they're teenagers (i.e. 17 or 18!). My other note is that Akira is based on the manga (magazine or &quot;comic book&quot;) of the same name, translated versions of which are available at most specialty comic book stores. If you think Akira is cool, get some of the mangas to find out what happens next!<br />Finally, I want to mention that the above review is based on the Special Subtitled Edition of Akira, which is hard but not impossible to find. Unlike the dubbed version, which at best gives you a fair approximation of the original script (in much the same way as a hamburger approximates a t-bone steak), the subtitled version (the one screened at film festivals) provides a much clearer view of the complex plot, subplots, and characters -- in particular the Colonel, the Akira children, and their various motivations. ...Remain in Light -- Phrodoe.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem is the best film that I have ever seen.  It is a film of such power, and of such amazing beauty that to watch it is the same as to have your heart ripped out.  Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director of incredible genius.
0780625129|5.0|We are all products of our environment, not so different from the character Derrick Vinyard in American History X.  Our experiences and upbringing mold our characters.  This movie demonstrates how easily each of us could become trapped in the cycle of hate.  With the death of his father Derrick went from a well-behaved kid to a man consumed with hate, but before the death, his father began a slow building hatred in Derrick with the racist and ignorant beliefs that he taught.  Derrick changes his entire life in order to ignore the hurt and joins a white power society seeking revenge.  Quickly, Vinyard emerges as their leader.  Many acts of violence are depicted which strengthen the power of the movie and the effect it has on its audience.  American history X explores the racial prejudices of our society by graphic images of hate and through this provides a strong message of individual change.  With his swastika tattoo and shaved head Derrick Vinyard leads his white power friends through a series of racist acts.  In one particular scene Derrick and fifteen others trash a store owned by immigrants.  In this scene the audience becomes enthralled with an overwhelming sense of hate.  Throughout the ordeal racial slurs were thrown about.  Whether associated with a minority or not the event came across as very real and offensive.  Actor Edward Norton, who plays Derrick, plays the part perfectly.  The shaved head and tattoos alone make Derrick seem evil, but the glaring eyes of Ed Norton make Derrick appear devilish.  The separation between black and white is witnessed in a territorial competition at the basketball courts.  Here the blacks and the whites play a game for the ownership of the courts.  Derrick turns out to be the star, winning the courts for his race.  In a retaliation attempt the black players who had lost decide to steal Derricks truck.  This becomes a fatal decision for two of the gang members.  Once Derrick discovers what is going on he runs out of the house wearing only a wife beater, some boxers, and holding a gun.  Derrick makes quick work of the problem, but is arrested and sent to jail.  Danny, his younger brother, who has witnessed all of the scenes described above, is left with these explicit images of hate and without a male role model.       While in prison Vinyard meets up with fellow skinheads who give him protection.  In the prison laundry department Derrick finds himself working along side a black man.  What at first is a quiet and tense relationship quickly develops into a strong friendship.  Derrick begins distancing himself from the other skinheads.  The skinheads soon become his enemies.  Derrick now begins to question everything that he has believed in, but without the protection of the other skinheads he is an easy target for those of color.  For some reason, he is never touched.  The reason is his friend from laundry detail, ironically a man that before Derrick would have hated because of his skin color.  Derrick undergoes a change once again, but this time a change for the better.  Derrick releases the hate that had been controlling him for so long.  When released from prison he comes home to a younger brother, who has been idealizing Derrick, following in his racist footsteps. Derrick has a tough challenge ahead of him, the alienation of his former friends, keeping his brother from continuing down the same path, and piecing together the family he had so brutally broken.  In his attempt to rid himself of his old friends fights and gunplay break out at a party put together for his return.  He and his brother Danny flee the scene and Derrick tells Danny all that happened to him in prison.  Danny understands why he doesn't want to continue being pissed off.  \\"Life's too short to be pissed off all the time.\\"  Prior to looking for a job the very next day, Derrick takes Danny to school.  Everything seems to be turning around for the Vinyard's.  Danny goes to the bathroom after entering school and a young aspiring gang member follows, with whom Danny had run into earlier in the movie.  The young gang member pulls out a gum and shoots Danny in the chest killing him.  As life pours out of his body one thing remains alive, a paper lying next to his body about the life of his brother titled, American History X.

B0000067X1|4.0|It's not the most even record ... of course now that it's available on a single disc (as opposed to 2-LPs) it's an even better value for money.<br />&quot;Paperhouse&quot; - great rhythmic track with stacked guitars that remind me of Sonic Youth.<br />&quot;Mushroom&quot; - this does indeed sound like a hip-hop beat in 1971.  Pretty great track, sounds like a little echo chamber full of horrors.<br />&quot;Oh Yeah&quot; - absolutely great groove by the drum 'n bass, while Irmin, Damo, and Michael make a great whirlpool of noise around it.<br />&quot;Halleluwah&quot; - James Brown-styled groove, carried on a bit too long.  Lots of good groovy ideas on here though.  Still, I prefer the edit on &quot;Cannibalism 1&quot;.<br />&quot;Augmn&quot; - tape manipulation, echo stuff, slowed down, speeded up, magic spells incanted, and a slowed-down drum solo.  Strange, headsy, and reminiscent (in a good way) of Stockhausen.<br />&quot;Peking O&quot; - intentionally chaotic and abstract, but with some groove in it.<br />&quot;Bring Me Coffee Or Tea&quot; - a crooning song.

B000024D4R|4.0|When people look back at Pink Floyd's albums of the 70's, they will most inevitably recall Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here,and The Wall.  The songs from these albums have almost become requird listening for any music fan.  But while these albums have aged quite well and become the stuff of legends, Floyd's 1977 classic, Animals, has really been forgoten about.  Yet it's hard to imagine an album as proggresive and unaccessible sounding as this to be a real hit.<br />Probably one of Floyd's most ambitious concept works, Animals isn't exactly like listening to Dark Side, or the Wall.   But at its core, this album is just as well written as the other classic floyd works.  And while The Wall and The Final Cut show a dictatorship of Waters, Animals still manages to sound like a group effort with each member maxing out thier musical abilities.<br />The lyrical tones are quite jagged and scathing as Waters unleashes his brutal social/polictal commentary on mankind.  This album has certainly has enough nihilism to be labled a dark, cold work.  But the band can still be inviting enough with some of its warmer moments.  The acoustic opener/closers &quot;pigs on the wing&quot; (parts one and two) are short, gentle pieces that balance out the mammoth inner section of the album and are essetial to the flow.  <br />Overall, Animals is a great tesitmant to Pink Floyd's ablilites to create soundscapes and storylines within the expanses of rock and roll.  True this album is not as joyful a listen as the early works through Moon, and is not as well constructed as  Wish You Were Here as a concept album, but is certainly worth any Floyd fans time to invesitigate.

6304077939|5.0|This film, about a boy in French-Canada growing up in a family with twisted chromosomes, is stunning.  The writing is beautiful, and the cinematography is both original and extraordinary.  The movie's use of the soundtrack is both inventive and emotionally effective.  I usually get offended by the use of emotional cue music, but in this case I'm feeling too much to notice.  I have watched this movie at least 30 times, and I am still catching elements that I missed.  This is extraordinarily hard to find, but it is well worth the effort.  There is some disturbing imagery, but the reward is very high.

B00005JG6R|5.0|Akira was made in 1989 and is now being reintroduced to the public. Katsuhiro Otomo's film takes place in Neo Tokyo and tells the story of Kaneda, the leader of a bike gang, and his friend Tetsuo who get caught up in a secret government project that involves the greatest power in the universe, Akira. This project is to develope ESP powers inside the brains of young children to learn the secret of Akira's growth pattern because power hungry government and military leaders want to control this power for themselves.When they find a person with a similar pattern who has the potential to awaken this power the question arises, can they really control this power or will it cause the end of Neo Tokyo? A must see movie for any anime fan. This film is rated R for language, excesive violence, and some nudity. Definately not for younger audiences.
0783232039|5.0|Don't let the title or subject turn you away!  I enjoyed this movie so much. This has to be one of the funniest horror flicks to date. The doll animation is incredible and the addition of the Tiff doll made it really enjoyable to watch.  The dolls facial expressions, body animation,and campy one liners are unforgettable!!  Yes, this is way over the top, but this glossy twisted flick is a a sure Friday night hit!! Crossing my fingers for &quot;Baby of Chucky&quot;......need to see it to believe it!
0452282152|5.0|This novel is an unusual achievement -- deeply powerful, yet told with brevity and simplicity.  Griet's story takes the reader on an engrossing journey into history, flawlessly weaving a fictional account into the nuances of an artistic masterpiece.  It is simple enough to be enjoyed by readers of all levels, yet sophisticated enough to haunt the imagination for days after the last chapter has been read.<br />Yes, Griet's character can be frustrating at times -- it is difficult to observe such a bright and talented woman unquestioningly accept her subservient position in the world.  My 21st-century mind railed against her servitude, her many disappointments, and the abuses she suffers (particularly her rivalry with Cornelia.)  However, this was the world into which she was born.  The descriptions of her day-to-day life, the markets, religious practices, and social customs opened my eyes to a part of history I'd never before explored.<br />How sad that some reviewers missed the richness this novel achieves without high drama, flashiness or explicit sexuality.  Ms. Chevalier elevates subtlety to an art form.  Much like a fine painting, it is best appreciated by those with open mind, a vivid imagination, and a willingness to be transported to another place and time.  I would highly recommend this book.
B000059QWJ|4.0|Dream Theater are an awesome group of musicians.  The sustaining energy through their performances is incredible!  I happened to be fortunate to have seen this concert from about 35 feet, dead center of the stage.  At first I was surprised to realize that they were going to play &quot;Metropolis&quot; from start to finish, and that they did.  Boy, did they!  As a fan since &quot;Images and Words&quot; I am thankful that someone picked up where the original progressive rockers like Yes, ELP, Rush, Kansas, etc. left off - and added a little testerone!  Watching these guys play is quite an experience.  Having the video to get a close-up look at their muscianship is a special treat.  As the music flowed from one track to the next, I was captivated by the performance.  However, there are a bit too many visual effects in the video where there may have been a better opportunity to feature the band, especially during a few &quot;solo&quot; interludes.  Sorry Mike.  Even so, after watching the video twice in three days, I must say that this a keeper!  I can only imagine the DVD!  The major drawback of the VHS is that the rest of the show is absent.  I don't know if it's on the DVD, but it's a shame that people can't see the balance of this amazing performance.  To see these guys just keep playing song after song for 4 hours was a sight to be seen.  Fortunately, I did, and reside myself to have been enriched by this event, however hot, smokey and smelly the club was.  I anxiously await their next offering.
B000058A1G|3.0|While the Who and the Small Faces were slugging it out for the attention of the mod kids in mid-60s England, The Action were left to fight for what was left of their musical attention spans.<br />The Action were more heavily influenced by American R&amp;B and Northern Soul than their more famous contemporaries, but were not afraid to be fierce on the guitar.  Despite being signed by George Martin of the Beatles/EMI fame, the Action languished in obscurity and petered out by 1967.<br />This disc is one of a few that has captured the band's sparse music catalogue (The Ultimate Action, which I presume is out of print, is another one that comes to mind).<br />The band was heavily into covers, but their version of &quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot; is a real gem and would make Smokey Robinson proud.

0201633612|5.0|I have been a computer professional for just 3 years, working with relational databases, procedural programming and 4GLs, and web development.  During that time I have read up on Object oriented programming and UML.<br />Of all languages to choose for my first foray into OO, would you believe Javascript?!  I want to convert my procedural routine for validating HTML form data to an object oriented paradigm.<br />Before starting to read this book, my very rough design was that a single instance of a FormValidator would loop through the various kinds of form elements that can take input, such as text fields, selection menus, radio buttons and checkboxes, then create a FieldValidator object for each.  The FieldValidator would in turn return a &quot;TypeValidator&quot; specific for the type of form element: TextValidator, MenuValidator, etcetera.<br />Thus I unwittingly incorporated a few of the designs covered in the book.  For instance, the &quot;Singleton&quot;, for a single instance of the FormValidator.  And the &quot;Builder&quot; for creating the TypeValidators specific to each type of form element.  And, following the books suggestion, I will probably use this Builder pattern to build a &quot;Composite&quot;, so that I can mix and match the methods for the various TypeValidators.<br />So, I disagree that this book does not get read.  I'm getting my money's worth!  And I disagree that you have to have designed one project before, though that could certainly help.  And I would say that if this book is over your head on the first try, if you are serious about OO, you will probably be able to come back to it in 6 months or a year or two, and it will make perfect sense.

B00005AXEL|5.0|This album is very well crafted! I love it! I think it is her best solo album to date. She began her solo career with &quot;Bella Donna,&quot; and she's almost 53 and continuing it strongly with &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La.&quot; Stevie puts her all into these songs. The title track is a  true rocker, with Stevie chanting the chorus, &quot;i hear there's trouble in shangri-la..i run through the grass, i run over the stones, down to the sea, show me the way back, honey.&quot; The three re-recorded demo's, &quot;Candlebright,&quot; &quot;Sorcerer,&quot; and &quot;Planets of the Universe,&quot; are great tracks! Stevie reaches outside her bounds on Sorcerer and hits some great high notes. On Candlebright and Planets her voice is more stronger than ever.    Sheryl Crow wrote the beautiful &quot;It's Only Love,&quot; for and about Stevie's life, and Stevie's voice is great for it. Natalie Maines fits greatly into the project as she duets with Stevie on &quot;Too Far From Texas,&quot; a country-rocker. Sarah McLachlan's voice is perfect background, in the haunting &quot;Love Is.&quot; The wide range of producers on this album, including Sheryl Crow, have helped add to the mysticism and creativity. &quot;Fall From Grace,&quot; is awesome, and rocks! Stevie rocks out in this song! All the songs are awesome, and Stevie does a lot of producing on this CD.    It is worth every penny, and I suggest everyone buying it. I love the booklet photos and art. It is such a great CD, we've been waiting a LONG time! Her legendary lyrics and haunting vocals, are still here. This prolific songwriter is in pure form. She only wrote 10 out of the 13 songs. But the John Shanks written song, &quot;Every Day,&quot; which is the first single, matches Stevie's style great. The chorus is especially catchy.   This CD puts her 1994 &quot;Street Angel&quot; album to shame. I liked &quot;Street Angel,&quot; ok but it's no comparison to this cd. This is definetely one Stevie Nicks CD all should get!!!!!!!!!
0553284347|3.0|I read this book ten years ago, when it came out in hardback.  This is a good book in the aspect that tells the reader that he/she is not alone in dealing with abusive parents.  One of the exercises in Toxic Parents suggests that you talk to the less intimidating of your parents.  So, I tried to talk to my mother.  She blew me off.  At the time, I was very upset and disappointed with this book's advice, which obviously failed.  Or, perhaps it was my approach.  At any rate, I learned that everybody has their own style and pace in dealing with dysfunctional behavior. Another warning: some of the stories may stir up strong emotions.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I gave this film five stars because it is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen.  It has some of the best actions scenes in any movie of it's type.  Blow's Deep Impacts out of the water.  For the guy who said it was too unrealistic, it's a movie, and most of them are unrealistic, except for true stories. I'm not trying to start an argument here, don't get me wrong.  Anyway, if you're into things blowing up, asteroids, space and Steve Buscemi, buy this movie.
B00000IAU3|5.0|My husband bought this album when I was feeling down. I really heard Dido in those songs. She has a way of stating exactly how one feels through song. 'Thank you' is a nice song but isn't the best on the album - just listen to 'My Life'. Talk about girl power!!!  Sara and Alanis have a great competitor here. Every woman should have copy of 'Dido' No Angel in her CD collection. It's been years since I've heard something so refresshing, original, and simply...simply beautiful.

It's hard to call a movie you've only seen once your favorite, but with Lawrence of Arabia, it's hard not to call it your favorite.  The scenes are cool, the directing is great and the directing is phenominal.  It doesn't get any better than this. I'm a film student currently and only dream of living up to this type of movie, which I'm sure I'll never be able to. I'll be honest, I don't own this film YET, but I strongly recommend, if you haven't seen it or don't own it, see it and add it to your coollection.
052594527X|3.0|I laughed reading reviews of this book - it seems to me that everyone took what Tracey Chevalier was trying to do a little too seriously. It is not an explicit biography of Vermeer. It is for every person who has ever looked at a work of art and wondered, \\"Who is that person? This person must have really existed, beyond this moment, and what was their life like?\\" Chevalier creates and intimate portrait of what might have been - I admired the mental processes she underwent, and her attention to detail (for example, how was it that this peasant girl had her ears pierced? How might this have come about?). This book is a testament to the power of imagination and of the gift human beings have to project - and create - what it might have been like to live in a century that we otherwise no longer have access to.
B0000507R0|5.0|Finally, after weeding my Vinyl, (with the orginial album from 1973, double folds)and splicing the 8 track, and gluing the cassette together who knows how many times, and in 1984 it comes out in CD form, I can really say, IT DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER THEN THIS. Today I bought the new release version of this album, Its is so clear, I could not believe it. I felt I was in the room when it was finally mix down... and to hear it out of 5 speakers was awesome, not a word I use. Listening to the bonus track of LUCKY MAN was very enjoyable, a song first release in 1970 from their first album. When this Album came out I was mezmerised by it, today It was the same feeling. This Format will do justice to all the Classic Albums of the 70&quot;s, Like Fragile by Yes, Dark Side of the Moon, Pink Floyd and so many others.  Now if only it comes out in Mini Disc.  If you never heard this album before now is the time.
B00001ZWTT|2.0|It's actually hard to put my finger on why this is so bad. In that respect it's a bit like 'Batman and Robin' - the ingredients are all there (Will Smith at the height of his fame, Salma Hayek at the height of her fame, the team behind 'Men in Black'), it just falls completely flat. Will Smith isn't too bad - he just doesn't have much to do. Kevin Kline, however, seems, as he always does, to be a completely blank slate of endless nothingness, the action sequences are sporadic and unexciting, and the film doesn't seem to have much of a point. Kenneth Branagh is just silly, and there aren't any other performances of note (Salma Hayek wears a nice bodice, but - like Smith - is just there to react to things). It's not really a comedy, because there aren't any jokes, and it's not a Ghostbusters-style 'comedic action film', because there's no much action. There are some nice special effects, Salma Hayek in bondage, and the music is suitably rousing, and that's pretty much the three positive attributes. Compared to 'Men in Black' it's a terrible disappointment, and it means nothing if you're British, like me, because we never got the original television series on which it is based.
B00005AXEL|2.0|I give this album only two stars for Trouble In Shang-ri-la&quot;  &amp;  &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;, these songs are great. I found the songs to be repetitive and not up to par with early Nick's work. If you can get it for free save your money and buy something else.
B00003CXAR|5.0|It's easy to forget how good this is - the string of 'nature vs man' films it helped spawn tainted it a little (and you could argue that it also started off, indirectly, the 'slasher film'), as did the ever-decreasing quality of the sequels. Looking at it now, it's surprising how often it avoids all the cliches of the genre it created - the monster doesn't get up at the end, the heroes are middle-aged and likeable, the corrupt mayor turns out to be human, after all - and how it manages to encompass so many different things. At different points it's a horror film, an adventure film, a man-vs-nature-vs-the elements film, a domestic comedy, all wrapped up with a superb musical score - not just the famous 'duh dum', but the rest of it too - and some great acting. Robert Shaw plays a cliche, but does so incredibly well; Roy Scheider's character gets most of the best lines; and although Richard Dreyfuss' character is a bit of a blank slate he nonetheless builds up a rapport with the others. The script is excellent, and some of the dialogue - 'You're gonna need a bigger boat', Quint's monologue - is eminently quotable. The shark itself isn't all that bad, and it's kept offscreen for much of the time, and anyway the film is so well directed - the scene where Scheider's character keeps watch on a packed beach, for example, is a masterpiece of editing and camerawork - that you *want* to believe that it's real. It's also easy to forget just how good Steven Speilberg can be when he puts his mind to it. The aforementioned beach scene, for example, or the simple shot of some orange barrels popping to the surface of the ocean. It's classically structured, in that there's a setup, a middle bit, and a finale, and should be taught in film school. It probably is. As for the 25th Anniversary DVD, it's better than the older DVD version of the film - the widescreen is slightly wider and you get some more extras. It's not really worth shelling out again, but if you don't have it already,get this one.
B00003CXC7|5.0|One would be hard-pressed to dethrone this film as Hitchcock's greatest film (NOTORIOUS is neck-n-neck). What is spectacular about this film, and many of Hitchcock's best works, is how he reveals characters. The opening shot in that pans around Jeffries' apartment then out the window to see the rest of &quot;players&quot; in this little drama, before coming back to Jeffries and his wares is simply an amazing tour-de-force in filmmaking style and technique. One recalls other great reveals like the opening in PSYCHO (the overhead shot of the lover's at the end of their mid-afternoon tryst) or the final death-rattle at the beginning of ROPE, one can help but revel in the Master at work. But one of the top reveals in movie history is when Grace Kelly makes her entrance and kisses Jimmy Stewart... breath-taking (Harry Lime's reveal in the THIRD MAN is one of the few major rivals).<br />And the opening is just the beginning, there are so many seminal Hitchcock moments in this film that one could continue discussing it for quite sometime, finding something new and exciting after each subsequent viewing - the true mark of magnificent cinema.<br />Anyone who has seen this film before, but not the restored version, will be seeing a &quot;new&quot; film. This transfer is unbelievable.
B000002V0Q|4.0|Countdown to Extinction, in my opinion, is Megadeth's best album. I know that many &quot;old time&quot; Megadeth fans look at this release as the beginning of the decline of Megadeth. But that is hogwash!<br />CTE is Megadeth's best! You know why? Because Dave Mustaine has finally matured as a songwriter. Rust in Peace is good, but it was still a bit rough around the edges. CTE is polished yet maintains the aggression Megadeth fans love. Sure, the speed metal of previous efforts is almost non-existent on CTE. But that's okay. The guitar riffs are still brutal and thrashy, the drumming is still heavy and the vocal attack of Dave Mustaine is still gruff and in-your-face.<br />The title track, &quot;Countdown to Extiction&quot;, is a great mix of heavy metal and semi-mainstream, catchy vocal melodies. &quot;Symphony of Destruction&quot; is a bruising, dark tune that pummels the listener with every chord. &quot;Psychotron&quot; is Mustaine at his gruff and growly best and the chorus soars! &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; is a nasty, ominous tune that makes one want to beat up the neighbor after listening to it (I'm kidding). Nearly all the songs here are good.<br />No, this isn't Rust in Peace.  Megadeth need not repeat themselves.  This is Countdown to Extiction, Megadeth's best.
B0000070SG|4.0|Very pleasant to see the oldies mentioned. Heavy acid influence  on an r an b background. I have it on reel to reel . This copy has extra tracks , but it shows the widespread appeal of the band . Still releasing . Mind blowing then and now. Pink Fairies anyone?
B0000029DD|5.0|I can only agree with the previous positive comments about this CD. Jeff Buckley had a wonderful voice which, teamed with his excellent song writing, made this a great album. But he is so little known, especially in the UK. Being 14 my generation aren't interested in decent music anyway, so I wouldn't expect them to care but I think Jeff is a massive (uncredited) influence on alternative music of the 90s and onwards. He should be remembered so.<br /> Don't quibble over this album. I bought it without hearing even just one track (Why? I'm not really sure) but I certainly didn't regret it. This is very powerful, very emotional haunting music. Just give it a little time.
0452282152|2.0|The book started off a good read, tenison and sorrow. However I was left with the feeling the author lost interest about half way through. I am not a student of this time period so was left confused over several plot twists such as why would being painted in a picture lead to ruin?
B000000OQF|5.0|This is a rock 'n roll classic.  If you don't own it; buy it.  You'll still listen to it in 30 years.
6305078564|4.0|This production of Austen's classic is truly terrific. It's my family's favorite show and we watch is all the time. With 154 glowing (and well deserved) reviews on Amazon, I won't waste time rehashing how wonderful this series is.<br />HOWEVER, the quality of this DVD conversion is TERRIBLE (hence the four stars)! The color is worse than that of the VHS tapes (I have them, too) and the picture is very grainy. The DVD appears to have been hastily thrown together. I would recommend the VHS tapes over this DVD. It is a shame that the effort and talent that went into the production was not represented better in the DVD format...
078062565X|5.0|The brilliant creators of the original &quot;King Kong&quot; concocted a cinematic soup the likes of which had never been seen- and never will be again. They combined elements of exploratory adventure, ancient pagan religion requiring human sacrifice, paleontology, archeology, mythology and romance. They added eye-popping special effects and an ear-shattering array of sounds- roars, grunts, squawks, hisses, shouts, crashes and those famous spine-tingling screams. All this was enhanced by an electrifying musical score and perfect casting. The result is the most exciting adrenaline rush of a movie experience that, even after countless viewings, never fails to deliver. Everyone has a favorite scene: perhaps the throbbingly frenzied bridal sacrifice; maybe the gargantuan hand snatching the beautiful heroine from her hotel room; or the colossal fight between Kong and the slithering, snapping carnivorous dinosaur- a struggle that has never been equaled in the history of screen showdowns. This movie is a series of unforgettably haunting images and sounds. With his gusto and theatrical voice, Robert Armstrong portrays the expedition leader Carl Denham with a contagious enthusiasm. Bruce Cabot delivers a refreshingly uncomplicated, virile performance- his Jack Driscoll cares only about saving the woman he has come to love. To make this fantastic story plausible, the most critical casting was that of Ann Darrow. With the wrong actress, all of the aforementioned elements would not have been enough to save the film's premise from falling faster than a giant gorilla off the Empire State Building. Indeed, it would have been merely an elaborate dirty joke. Fortunately, they cast an actress with the perfect combination of credentials: beauty, feminine grace, sweet innocense and an uncanny ability to portray sheer, unadulterated terror. Fay Wray was- and is- the only woman for Kong. Almost seventy years of sequels, remakes and ripoffs only emphasize this movie's matchless ability toentertain.  Carl Denham's prophetic declaration early in the film still applies today- we need &quot;new adjectives&quot; to describe this work of art.
1881273156|5.0|This book is aimed at couples, but the principles apply to all relationships.  Reading this book has improved my understanding of my mother's need for Gifts, my friend's need for Quality Time, my husband's need for Acts of Service, my sister's need for Words of Encouragement and my own need for Touch.<br />I also applied the principles as leader of a small group Bible Study.  With 10 women involved, we represent all 5 Love Langugaes twice over.  Where we were having conflicts before, I was able to identify love-expression needs of the individuals in the group, and guide us all toward helping every person internally feel loved, comfortable and welcome every time we meet.  What a difference!  <br />You can even apply these principles in the workplace - understanding my boss' secretary's Love Language has certainly improved my job performance...<br />Buy it, read it, use it well, pass it on.
630505116X|5.0|Some people just take movies too seriously, this movie was not meant to be a Oscar winning drama, It is a fun popcorn movie that you can laugh at and has cool special effects and dialog. I  am convinced that the majority of the critics who trashed this movie have just been so jaded by all the crap they have seen they just destroy any movie that does not surprise them or shock them with something new. This movie does no try to be anything it is not and that is just a fun adventure flick. So just relax and enhoy it.
B00005AXEL|5.0|GO STEVIE! A die-hard Stevie fan since 1974, I had almost written her off after 1994's Street Angel turned out to be such a disappointment. But in recent years (with FM's The Dance and her Enchanted box set), I began to regain hope that her songwriting skills and beautiful voice would rebound from the drugs and abuse she heaped on herself. With Trouble in Shangri-La, she has rebounded with a vengeance! Stevie's cryptic lyrics are more evocative and poetic than just about anything she has ever written. Her voice is older and deeper,  but stronger and as expressive as her Rhiannon days. And the music! The music on this CD, simply put, rocks the house. Every song is worth repeated listenings. My favorites are the crankin' Planets of the Universe (a la Stand Back) and the soaring melodic Sorcerer. Thank you, Stevie, for coming in from the darkness and delivering this shining CD. It's a must-have for Stevie fans.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I have been a fan for many years and have heard everything these guys have ever done. The reason they are still around is their ability to do new things with their music.  Why people insist on putting labels on music(ie disco, rock, rap etc..)baffles me.  Music is music. It's either Good, Bad or somewhere in-between. This album is GOOD!!! I love the A side especially.  Wedding Day, Deja Vu and Sacred Trust are awesome songs. These guys are like a Fine wine, they just get better with time.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I knew the Lyrics to video by my second radio listen...that speaks of a great song!  I had  the opportunity to listen to Ms. India live in Chicago at McCormick Place during the Todays Black Woman conference.  You Chicagoans that went home early missed out! I stopped her to let her know that her lyrics were beautifully poetic.  Sometimes we as listeners underestimate the value and beauty of simplicity,I take care not to. I truly appreciated her vocal performance and thusly-purchased the CD.  Acoustic Soul done with sensuality...Speak India Arie you are truly Poetic.
B00004BZ0V|3.0|These are all great tracks, but you should already have copies of THE CLASH, GIVE'EM ENOUGH ROPE, LONDON CALLING, and SANDINISTA, which would give you most of this compilation already.<br />On the other hand, it gives you a CD version of &quot;This Is Radio Clash,&quot; one of the great overlooked singles of all time.  Apocolyptic may be too gentle a term for this single, which unnerved the punk scene when it was released on 12-inch in 1981.  Clown time, as Elvis liked to say, was over.
0517548232|5.0|This is a book that looks at the shadow side of government altruism in economics.  Henry Hazzlit's main thesis is that when we focus our economic policy on a particular group, we somehow ignore other groups that are adversely effected.  A high tariff on cars may help manufacturers of cars, but it hurts those who buy cars.  Artificially boosting milk prices may make the farmer feel rich, but it's out of the pockets of the milk buyer.  Since there are far more consumers than producers, the special attention harms more people than it helps.<br />In essence, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  The government focuses on paying Paul, but not stealing from Peter. Hazzlit argues that both deserve their due.  Usually Paul is big and easy to see, but even if Peter is a conglomeration of people and hard to find, he still exists and he is still being hurt.  He also argues that Job Works programs like the New Deal are more harmful than helpful, because they absorb resources that could be more productively used in the free market.  People are a component of productivity, argues Hazzlit, and when their use is diverted to inefficient means, the loss of productivity costs every taxpayer and citizen a better life.<br />Hazzlit gets a lot done in this short volume.  He uses the kind of common sense that seems to be absent from most economic theories and his writing style is very easy to follow.
B000007OY0|5.0|I love THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. It easily ranks as one of my top 10 films of all time.<br />Robbins is fantastic, Freeman is (as always) perfect. Direction is magnificent. The opening fly-by shot of the bus arriving at Shawshank is a classic piece of cinemaphotography. Even the score is magnificent.<br />But I'm baffled by the editorial review by Jeff Shannon (above). Specifically, when Shannon writes &quot;we realize there's reason to believe the banker's crime was justifiable,&quot; what on earth is he talking about?!? <br />Just for starters, the banker didn't commit the crime. And nowhere in the film is it even vaguely implied that it was a justifiable crime---JUSTIFIABLE DOUBLE HOMICIDE? HUH?!?
630027120X|5.0|&quot;The Mission&quot; was an excellent film that tells the story of the injustice that the Guarani faced in South America because of the cruelty of the Portugese and Spanish settlers.  It is a story of the Guarani people and their human rights versus the rights of the church and of the powers in Spain and Purtugal. Well casted, Jeremy Irons plays a jesuit priest who colonizes with the Guarani in order to christianize them and make their lives &quot;better.&quot;  His mission is to salvage their humanity and protect them from the cruelties of the Spanish and Portugese crowns who wish to take over their land.  But is he really their savior?  Robert DeNiro plays the perfect role of the harsh slave trader gone good.  His determination of penance makes the audience almost feel sorry for him.  If not for the actors, watch the movie for its cinematography.  The scenery is absolutly beautiful!  The camera finds a healthy balance between nature and man's bad intention. It will teach you a lesson in history that you will not soon forget!
B000002UAU|5.0|After all the years, all the hype and--holy cow--451 amazon.com customer reviews, what is there left to say about SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND?<br />Maybe we should set all of that aside, and realize that there is really a very good album hidden behind all of that rubbish.<br />Starr had been playing seminal drums for years, creating a whole new attack on &quot;Tommorow Never Knows.&quot;  On &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; he introduced the world to the thunderous drum entrance.<br />McCartney had been playing melodic bass for a few LPs, on Pepper he takes it to new heights.  His voice hasn't reached the level of perfection it would hit from 1968-1976, but it was reaching a point where it's warmth, depth and technical skill would soon be unmatched.<br />Lennon had given the world a glimpse of his Lewis Carrol/Dylan Thomas influence on RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER, but it really comes into full bloom on PEPPER.  Looking back, PEPPER is the only Beatles LP where Lennon seemed content and happy.  Perhaps because, as on DOUBLE FANTASY, the only other Happy John LP, it came after a time of relative seclusion: the Beatles left the road in 1966 and spent months holed up at EMI making PEPPER, &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;; the Lennonos spent 5 years at Dakota before making DOUBLE FANTASY.<br />Harrison is given only a minor role on PEPPER, but makes the most of it.  A second dose of eastern influence, only hinted at on previous Beatle records, is passed around on &quot;Within You Without You.&quot;  Amazing to me, according to the sheet music, this song is played entirely in C.<br />It's a great album, from start to finish; &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; stands as one of the greatest recordings ever.  George Martin should have been given a knighthood and then some for putting together this kind of straospheric beauty on a 4-track machine.<br />I've read where George Martin says the Beatles originally recorded the &quot;Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane&quot; single as the first tracks for PEPPER, but were pressured by EMI to release them ahead of time.  Imagine the impact this album would have had with the inclusion of those songs, two of the greatest tracks you'll ever hear.<br />So, is PEPPER the greatest album of all time?  No.  PET SOUNDS, BLONDE ON BLONDE, WHO'S NEXT, several Beatle LPs, and several others are right up there with PEPPER.  Add &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; to PEPPER and you'd have a better argument.<br />But is PEPPER the most important album of all time?  Without any doubt.  This was the dividing line between Pop and Rock, the moment where two worlds, one peopled by Teen Beat and the Flip Your Wig game and American Bandstand, and the other creating Rolling Stone and Haight Asbury and Woodstock, went their seperate ways.<br />It was the moment that youth culture began to be taken seriously, by the establishment and by baby boomers themselves.<br />It was the moment that the Beatles finally and irrevicably seperated themselves from the pack, reasserting themselves as the best thing since the invention of the friggin' wheel.<br />It was a great band flexing it's muscle, putting all the world on notice that they were the once and future Kings.<br />By the way...when was the last time you listened to SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST?
B00005221M|4.0|Epics are some of the most visionary and illustrious films in Hollywood, evoking many different feelings with their stories of love, war, and human discovery. These movies usually are based on a historical event or time period, and can either remain completely authentic, or include a fictional story which sometimes is added to enhance the feeling the event or time evokes. I love movies like this: they have so much to show us, so much that we can relate to and sometimes learn from. <br />&quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is one of these films, embodying all the these traits while remaining a film that appeals to a broad audience. Those seeking battle scenes filled with intense moments of hand-to-hand combat will find it satisfying, while the emotional story of three men, the last of their tribe, as well as the unlikely romance between two of the characters will keep just about everyone enthralled. The history behind this film has been debated as to its authenticity, and though some cynics will use this as a disuasion from seeing the film, I highly recommend it for its ability to evoke such emotion and granduer from every nuance of its development and progression. <br />The story revolves around three remaining Indian men, known as the Mohicans, whose destiny is futile due to the ongoing French and Indian war in the year of 1757. The movie focuses most on Hawkeye, who was raised by the Mohicans and has been forced to serve as a guide for the British. Chingachgook, the last of the true Mohicans, raised him as his own, as he did his blood son, Uncas. The story sweeps around their involvement with the British forces that dominated the lands, leading into the battles between the British armies and the joined French and Indian forces. At the heart of this story is the mens' will to survive in the face of this danger, which becomes complicated by the budding romances between Hawkeye and Cora, Uncas and Alice; both women happen to be the daughter of a renowned British general. <br />The movie chooses to focus more on the romance of Hawkeye and Cora, who waste no time in giving in to their feelings without denial. This focus rests mainly on the urgent nature of their relationship: while most films would draw the romance out against the war backdrop, this one establishes their love quickly to emphasize the unknown dangers of the time period. They realize that anything can happen that could take away their love, which is what keeps them together and brings their relationship to an intensity previously unseen in any film. Like their bond, the ties that keep Uncas and Alice together are equally strong, and it is ultimately their bond that will prove to be the most effective in the final mezmerizing sequences. <br />The complications do not come solely from the ongoing war, but from the disputes among Hawkeye and Colonel Munro, Cora's father. His refusal to comply with the commands of Munro lands him in risky situations, which brings a small hardship. The movie uses this to embody strength and courage within our romancing characters, as shown in their refusal to be separated from one another in the face of the war or the betrayal of Munro. The final third of the film completely sells us on this strength: our heroes will do unexpected things to pursue their kidnapped loves, while the women themselves will show their will and determination to be with the ones they love. <br />Secondary characters provide obstacles to the romance as well as the lives of our heroes. The character of Duncan is a two-way street: his loyalty to the British army and his willingness to win over the love of Cora, even if that love goes no farther than friendship, will bring him to a turning point later into the movie. Magua is a fierce Indian chief who leads the Indian armies devoted to the French, and his interaction with our characters will bring the movie to a brilliant climax. <br />Indians in films are always learned and wise, and the movie takes no libertieswith this. A scene between Cora and Hawkeye reveals his intelligence and insight into the nature of things around him, and his explanation of the existence of the stars proves the &quot;wise beyond years&quot; adage. Chingachgook portrays everything that an aged Indian should: the very wrinkles of his face are evidence of his many overcome hardships, while his ways with words, especially in the movie's closing dialogue, are some of the most moving and involving emotional and worldy insights I've ever heard in a film. <br />As I paid close attention to the fictional development, the historical story is also quite involving. The battles scenes are grueling and intense, putting us right in the middle of the brutal but not overly gory action. These scenes are some of the movie's most authentic, made believable by the choreography of the fighting on each opposing side. Some have criticized the way in which the French and Indian war in portrayed, or more fittingly, who fought who. I, myself, have no residing knowledge concerning this time in history, nor am I about to ruin my favor for this film by researching it. My belief is that this film has much to offer with its sweeping tale, so just enjoy it for that. <br />This sweeping tale is just what those words describe: the breathtaking visual acuity of the surrounding nature is completely visceral and moving, adding to the overall emotional effect. Period costumes and sets are authentic and bring us into a time gone by, mastering the use of meticulous craftsmanship to add to the film's true-to-life nature. Scenes underneath a giant waterfall provide a setting that is both sensual and dangerous, while the fog-covered mountains which bookend the film remain ominous and resonant in our minds long after viewing the movie. Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman compose the magical score, which is the defining key to bringing a certain majesty and presence to the surroundings as well as adding to the telling of the love story. <br />Daniel Day Lewis is cast as Hawkeye, providing a brilliant aura as the hero who rushes to save the day and his love. He brings exhuberance and power to his role, an ideal hero who goes through the motions and comes out the winner. Madeleine Stowe is Cora, his love, and her performance, coupled with her convincing chemistry with Lewis, keeps the passion and the emotion alive. Eric Schweig and Jodhi May portray Uncas and Alice, and while their romance takes a backseat for most of the picture, their performances in their defining moments are stunning and awe-inspiring. Russell Means brings a sense of intelligence and wise knowledge to the role of Chingachgook, while Wes Studi is equally convincing in his role as the evil and ruthless Magua. <br />&quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; is a film for the ages, and practically bleeds passion and intensity. It's romance is moving and powerful, as is the story of human strength and courage that surrounds our characters and sweeps us into a web of emotion. This is a movie I can sit through with eagerness each time, knowing that each viewing will be different from the first. I loved this movie!
B000002KBH|5.0|This may be the Grateful Dead LP for people who don't like the Dead.<br />I know I qualify as a NON-Deadhead.  I just never got it; the whole concept of 45-minute guitar solos, two-drummers, and what sure appeared to be a lot of soft rock hype never drew me in.  I heard at least three different live Dead recordings, and I was bored stiff by them all.<br />That said, this is one great album, which I have listened to thousands of times and tried to turn all my friends on to for years.<br />Like Garcia's forays into bluegrass (see the forgotten classic OLD AND IN THE WAY), this album displays a band taking its time, relaxing in a group of songs that sound like American standards.  <br />There is a warmth to this album that makes you feel like a welcome friend.  It's rural without being redneck, warm without being sappy, relaxed without being boring.
B00000K19E|2.0|I can't understand why everyone is so dedicated to this movie.  I don't see anything so original about this very familiar story.  I liked it the first time when it was called Star Wars, or Alice and Wonderland, or even THE BIBLE.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Laurence Fishburne, he was a bad mother; shut your mouth.  The special effects don't really do it for me either.  The idea of several cameras set up to capture a fluid action isn't a new one. This was the whole idea behind the advent of the motion picture camera, so just get over it people please.  There are so many other quality pictures out there so just pick those up instead.  THAT'S IT I'M DONE!
B000002UB6|3.0|Like SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, LET IT BE has been the subject of such heated debated and intense scrutiny over the years that the album itself is almost overlooked in all the hub-bub.<br />LET IT BE was, for years, my favorite Beatles LP. Looking back I realize it is because LET IT BE, along with certain moments on RUBBER SOUL and much of the WHITE ALBUM, allows listeners to feel as close as possible to the Beatles. Beginning with \\"Two Of Us,\\" most of LET IT BE sounds as if the Beatles are sitting with you in your living room, playing just to play.<br />Of course, there are moments destoyed by Phil Spector. \\"The Long And Winding Road,\\" a nice little ditty by McCartney, sung and accompanied by piano, is turned into a nightmarish, sugary-sweet power ballad by Spector, who soaked the tapes in syrup and sprinkled sugar and a cherry on top. McCartney was furious, and had ever right to be. <br />That's a real shame, since McCartney is the only Beatle who seems to have put any effort into LET IT BE. Lennon is virtually non-existant, providing only odd one-liners that nobody laughs at, and confusing lyrics that are neither poetic nor meaningful. Harrison plays poorly, over-relying on a bad fuzz box. Even Ringo, who is the heart of all great Beatle music, seems disinterested, coming to life briefly on \\"Let It Be.\\"<br />If LET IT BE does nothing else, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that George Martin was a vital, irreplaceable piece of the Beatles. Without him, the band floundered.
B000059MEK|5.0|If you're thinking that Daft Punk is just another Euro dance outfit, think again. If you've heard of their association with Mirwais and Madonna, hear them yourself.<br /> Moby has his brand of ambient-industrial dance music. Groove Armada has their electronic style. Daft Punk? Well, theirs is a irresistable 60's/70's retro funk intertwined with 90's/00's electronic vibe. By acieving this deadly concoation, they have reached the plateauof craft and artistry.<br /> On this follow-up to their  excellent 1998 debut, Daft Punks starts off with the funky One More Time which makes u wanna hop onto that dancefloor and shake ur thang. Other gems include the electrifying follow-up Areodynamics, Nightvision, Something About Us and the 10-minute closer Too Long (no pun intended I suppose). Sampling from everyone including Barry Manilow (yes Barry Manilow), Daft Punk is able to further funki-fy their music.<br /> Although the first half of the CD tends to be more engaging, the rest of the CD is anything but your standard/usual radio fare. The secret to enjoying the Daft punk experience: listen to the CD in it's entirety. You'll get hooked almost immediately.<br /> A little bonus on this CD is the Daftcard which allows you to download a Daft Punk player for playing exclusive remixes and rare tracks from the Internet using the card number (much like your credit card). However, due to intensive security concerns, the download takes a while if you are not connected to cable or hi-speed network. But once it's done, you'll find it worthwhile. The songs played will be kept track and no, you can't distribute or download it due to Digital Rights Management (DRM). This ain't no Napster. Then again, it's quite cool overall, both  the CD and the downloads.<br /> Discover Daft Punk. If you're game for more, try Homework, their debut.
B000002UDB|5.0|The only Beatles LP mocked by the press during the 1960s, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is actually an odd little masterpiece.<br />All of the Beatles shine here: McCartney's bass playing is masterful, Ringo's drumming unusually loose and, as always, driving, Lennon is at the height of his peace-n-love weirdness, and Harrison simply rips the place apart with the heavy duty \\"Blue Jay Way.\\" Is there anything on vinyl more ominous than the organ and bass intro and the first line: \\"There's a fog upon L.A....\\"?<br />MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR also contains both sides of the greatest Pop single of all time, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Penny Lane,\\" both masterpieces in their own right. Their inclusion alone makes this a disc everyone should own.
B00000J6AG|5.0|It's friggin' brilliant. Just buy it.
B00003CXN3|4.0|Steven Soderberg gives a tale about drugs in America. He shifts around in many differnt views f people. Michael Douglas is great. Benicio Del Toro(The Pledge) did a great supporting job. It was much better than OUT OF SIGHT.
B000003RCY|5.0|About a year or so ago my friend introduced me to Rammstein. I've been listening to German music ever since. This is the best band. And in my opinion, Herzeleid is the best CD of theirs yet. There's only one song I don't care for (#5 Seemann) but it's not the worst song either. If you like metal or you're just looking for something besides American music, this is the CD to get.
B00001NFCY|1.0|... this [is] deep religious rooted rock... I personallydisliked this album and dislike a great deal of this music.  I suggestthat people check out Jackyl's Greatest Hits, Poison's Power tot hePeople, New Tattoo by Motley Crue, and even certain tracks off Crushby Bon Jovi. But, this stuff is just entirely too good boy for me.
0671034065|5.0|This book held my interest from beginning to end! A little risque, but I enjoyed every minute of it. It was funny, yet romantic. This is one of my favorite books written by a romance writer. I highly recommend it.
B000002JNN|5.0|For a good hard rock vacation, listen to The Razor's Edge and be taken to a place where the rock won't stop and the musicians play instruments unlike today's pop bands. ACDC, a legendary rock band, delivered what I personally feel is their second best album ever, second only to Back in Black. From Thunderstruck to Fire Your Guns, to Money Talks, you get 3 of their best songs on one album and also get The Razor's Edge which is a very solid song and also get a great song for the Holiday Good Cheer called Mistress for Christmas! :)<br />Seriously, get it. There is not a bad song on the album.
B00005ATQM|5.0|This is the first audio DVD I have purchased, and reading some of the other reviews has made me understand the whole audio DVD scene.. Thanks!   I dont feel too alone though because until I got on line today most other retailers are clueless to this new format. The local stores in my area gave me a dumb look when asked about audio DVD, they had better wake up because it is awesome! Oh yeagh Metallica, it ROCKS.. I have an endless list of artists and albums that need to be done in this format..Definetley worth your bucks..With or without a &quot;audio&quot; DVD player. Cant wait for new releases..The sound quality of the Black Album jump out at you and sound like youve heard it for the first time..Boy I love technology...!
B0000047CX|5.0|Extremely romantic, easy, simple, absolutely beautiful.  It's a masterpiece that should be in *anyone's* collection!  Buy it...you will not be disappointed.
0679428887|2.0|I sat down on a flight to Chicago, looking forward to demolishing the new Robert Harris.  'Enigma' had been a reasonable read, if a little over done.  Sadly, 'Archangel' was hard work.  Great concept, and a pretty good initial hook, with Fluke Kelso uncovering this slender link to the hidden memoirs of Stalin.  The first fifty or so pages sets up the premise and the story builds with some momentum....but by page 150, it still feels like set up!<br />Harris's style takes a bit of digesting and does not make for a fluid, easy read.  His knowledge of history is great and I now feel better briefed on Russia's legend and culture.  But his characters are a bit wooden and I never got to connect with Fluke Kelso.<br />The final few chapters do have some pace and some action, but it's more like Rambo than the 'great literary thriller' the cover boasted!  Harris can do better and will do better.  Harris is a writer worth sticking with - but not if he serves up another of these!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Let me just start out buy saying The Goonies rule.  This was one of my favorite movies growing up as a child.  Now it is finally going to be released on DVD with deleted scenes intact.  The two scenes I talk about are the octopus battle and the scene at the convenient store.  These were only to be seen on the Disney Channel and I have been waiting ten years to see these scenes again.  Mr. Speilberg, thank you.  You have truly made an 18-year old feel like a kid again.  Now if they would only put out &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; out on DVD then I would be very happy.
0880790121|5.0|Back in the 1970s, when I first became involved with the tarot, I  remember being very disappointed with the cards available at that time.  The Waite deck, in its time a ground-breaking and innovative project, had, in my opinion, all the zest and brilliance of Arthur Edward Waite's writing style -- as Regardie put it, &quot;turgid, pompous and pretentious.&quot;  To me, utterly useless.  Then along came the Sacred Rose.  For the first time, here was imagery that was bright, clear in meaning, reflective and yet also very much alive.  I never really took the tarot seriously until I encountered this deck, and even now, with many other fine and innovative decks having appeared on the scene, this is still the deck I consider the best.  The images are reminiscent of stained glass, but really evoke an entirely different feeling than other decks.. Rather than telling you what the cards mean, it seems as though the images draw their meaning out from the inside.  In addition, there is none of the formal stodginess of traditional decks; you can almost smell the woods and flowers that illuminate the borders, and feel the forces the cards represent, something like looking toward the stars on a cold, clear night.  If this all sounds a bit romantic, it is because the images are themselves romantic, and that kind of interaction is what succesful use of the tarot is all about.  this is a good deck for beginners as well as experienced readers, and is capable of producing readings from the mundane to the deepest of spiritual encounters.  Highly recommended; don't leave your astral home without it.
0441172717|2.0|I am a life-long SF fan and finally got around to reading Dune for the first time in my 31st year.  I was very disappointed.  I cannot come anywhere close to agreeing with its 'title' of SF's grand masterpiece.  I found the writing unsatisfying and quite dated.  Too much drug use stuff (boy, you can tell it was written in the sixties!), too much exposition, and too little character development (of everyone but Paul at least, who I really got too much of).  Potentially interesting minor characters are introduced, only to be killed off in very vague ways before they can really be developed.  The spacing Guild and how they use the spice is never really explained, nor is CHOAM and the endless, sketchy references to it.  The Emperor (and the Guild for that matter), very important characters, are never even seen until the very end, and ALL the action takes place in the last 50 pages or so.  However, the worst part is the ending; the one-on-one fight with Feyd is very predictable, and I was seriously expecting to turn the page to another chapter when it ended; terrible ending, quite a let down.<br />The bad stuff being said, the book does get progressively better as it goes along; or at least less boring.  And it does paint an intriguing picture of Arrakis, I do now find myself interested in Dune itself, and that is a very original and interesting part of the story.  I have been anxious to finish the book and watch the movies.  I do find myself thinking about stuff from the book, so it does kindof 'get under your skin' I think, even if like me you don't think its very good.<br />I guess I was expecting it to be the Lord of the Rings of Sci-Fi, but it does not even come close.  If you want a grand epic that is the pinnacle of its genre (fantasy, in that case) I recommend you stick with it.  Dune is quite a let down by comparison.
B000002J27|4.0|'A Trick Of The Tail' was deffinitely a nice start for Phil Collins as vocalist, but he is not yet at his best. That very much sums up the problems as I see it, because the umsic featured here is great.<br />The song line-up includes several live classics, especially 'Dance On A Volcano / Los Endos'. These songs, along with 'Squonk' and 'Robbery, Assault and Battery' are good, dynamical, uptempo songs with great musical solos, guitar (Dance/Los Endos) as well as keaboard (Robbery). Unfortunately, good as they are, I will at all times prefer the live-versions of 'Seconds Out', which especially features much better vocal performances by Collins. On the other hand, 'Entangled', with it's hypnotizing ending musical section, and 'Ripples', wich is one of the most beautiful works of the group, are at their best in the studio recordings. 'Mad Man Moon', never played live, is also a very beatiful song, both musically and lyrically, and Collins does a great vocal job here. Also, the title track is nice, featuring some of the more easygoing sound they would return to later ('That's All' e.g.) and great lyrics.<br />All in all, 'A Trick' is a nice album, but I haven't heard it a lot since I got 'Seconds Out', and musically I prefer the '77 release 'Wind And Wuthering'.
0061003697|5.0|This is my first and so far only Agatha Christie book, but if the rest are like this, I can well understand why she is the best-selling author of all-time.<br />The first several chapters briefly introduce our cast of characters, who they are, who they work for, and what their feelings might be (i.e. their motives) regarding our central characters (i.e. the ones around whom a crime might be committed.) These introductions catch the reader quickly, as if he is among the passengers on the cruise. The profiles are diversified, realistic and tense.<br />From these profiles, Christie weaves a plot through various interviews between the detective, witnesses, possible suspects, and between other bystanders, etc.<br />The plot is intricate and requires careful reading, and even a guess to determine who the murderer might be.<br />Here, Christie allows the suspense to come down to the wire, and in the last few chapters, all incidents are tidied up in a realistic and satisfactory fashion.
B000002J2B|5.0|'Wind and Wuthering' is perhaps THE album for those of us who think that Tony Banks is and has always been the very center of the music of Genesis. From first, his elegant and impressive and quite unique keaboardplaying on '11th Earl Of Mar', to last, his unmatched ability to catch the good tune on 'Afterglow', he is the center of this recording. OK, Michael Rutherford contributed with some, at best, nice but a triffle boring songwriting with 'Your Own Special Way', and Phil Collins and Steve Hacket does their job excellent, but it is because of Banks that this building is still standing as tall as ever.<br />The opener, '11th Earl Of Mar', is close to catching the spirit of the album in one song. It's uptempo and violent but still quit and beautiful, got some quite obscure but interesting lyrics and is all in all impossible to describe and impossible to dislike. You can play it lout or you can play it quit, and it's ever powerful. It's got Banks uptempo and powerful keaboardplaying somewhat like 'Down And Out' (from '...And Then There Were Three...'), if not as frenzied as the later.<br />The second song, 'One For The Vine', is a ten minutes epic masterpiece (written by Banks), about war and tyrany, and with some extended and very great guatur and piano-solos. The studio-version is great, but the live-version featured on the remastered 'Three Sides Live' is even better. Again the song combines some beautiful, silent piano-parts with more rough guitar parts, but it blends together very nice.<br />'Your Own Special Way' is a standard pop-tune, as produced a lot times later (and better), so I won't waste my breath on it; the instrumental track 'Wot Gorilla' features uptempo keaboardplaying, but becomes primary a filler.<br />'All In A Mouse's Night', on the other hand, contains some great keaboard-tunes and some very funny lyrics. Collins is excellent here, and I find the light-harded tune impossible to dislike. 'Blood On The Rooftops' is dark and quite interesting (many find the writer duo Hackett/Collins a litlle strange, I think...).<br />The ending triplet, 'Unquit Slumbers For The Sleapers...', '...In That quit Earth' and 'Afterglow' starts with some silent, somewhat hypnotizing keaboard-tunes, but goes into a roaring inferno of guitar and keaboard; very noisy but still tightly structured. The violent musical track makes the perfekt contrast to the silent, beatiful 'Afterglow', which, even in a version much inferior to the one of 'Three Sides Live', makes an excellent ending track.
B000002I4S|5.0|How can anyone rate this less than 5 stars? It is a sheer work of genius. I am certainly no jazz expert, but I know enough to know that this album is amazing. And you also most certainly do not need to be a jazz expert to enjoy this album. It is totally accessible to anyone who appreciates great music. The booklet includes an interesting essay on the music and the man, by Nat Hentoff. The 5 bonus tracks are certainly a plus and make this cd certainly worth buying. In fact, this is an album that every true-blue jazz fan should own.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is Stevie Nicks at her best. Her vocals on Trouble in Shangri-la are amazing! If you ever liked Stevie Nicks, anytime during her long music career, Trust Me, you will love this CD - every song is a winner! Standouts are FALL FROM GRACE a rocker of a song, PLANETS OF THE UNIVERSE, CANDLEBRIGHT, SORCERER, LOVE IS and BOMBAY SAPPHIRES are my personal favorites! All that is left for Stevie is to graciously accept her many grammy awards (next year) deservingly so for triumphantly returning to the top of her form, making great music.
B000056K04|1.0|This album is terrible.  It's noisy, unsexy and simplistic in lyrics.  In fact, you will get more romance from a Hallmark card. Witness this line: &quot;Legs don't work 'cause you want me so bad so you just lie spread.&quot; Women don't like to think of themselves as &quot;spread,&quot; Dave.  That is locker room talk at best. Dave Matthews Band has distinguished itself on all other albums and in concert with long violin and saxophone solos, extremely erotic lyrics and, to me, a lot of foreign influence in the music which had always kept things interesting until this album. If you have not heard much of the band's music and buy this album, you will probably not like the band.  I suggest you buy any other album they have done, or any other album in the world.  I have had a listen to their new music that is not released yet, and it is great.  So buy an older cd or just wait for another to be released. But do not waste your hard-earned dough on this one.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This film is an epic retelling of Superman, and stands up today as still the best comic book adaptation ever made.  It takes Superman seriously, yet has comic relief that never veers into total camp.  At the core of the movie is a wonderful love triangle between Superman, Clark and Lois.  No comic book movie since has captured anything remotely close to romance.  Superman's act of love in the end is touching and, like it's character and the movie itself, epic.  It challenges a straight-and-narrow Boy Scout character with raw emotion.  This new DVD is wonderful.  It contains three half-hour informative documentaries, several funny and interesting screen tests, and a lush transfer.  The 8 minutes edited back into the film don't add much beyond a curiosity level, but they don't detract from the final product either.  At this price, this is definitely a must-have.  My only complaint is the boring snap-case packaging Warner Bros. loves so much.  There is something to be said about presentation, and they aren't saying it with this (or any of their other DVDs') packaging.
B00000DFTH|3.0|I am a die hard black sabbath fan (although I am not a fan of their lyrics).  I used to and still love Iommi's guitar and Ozzy's evilish vocal which migle well with their group name Black Sabbath.  Naturally I bought this album to expect their tunes hopefully in better recording quality because their first 5 albums still haven't been digitally remastered.  By listening to this CD, I realized that the old chemistry wasn't there anymore.  Particulary, Ozzy's vocal is in sad shape.  He contantly encourages crowd to sing and most of the time sings one octave lower cause can't sing the high notes anymore.  Overall stick to their studio CDs.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I must admit when I first heard Stevie Nicks was coming out with a new album, I was weary of its quality, even though, I consider myself a strong Nicks fan.  However, I decided to give it a listen, and WOW, what a pleasant surprise.  I literally can't stop listening to it, and when I can't listen to it, the songs won't leave my head.  I wouldn't go so far to say it's better than Bella Donna (Nicks first solo album, which is now a classic), but it is definitely a close second.<br />The best songs on here are the title track, the chorus on that is brillant, &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; is great, &quot;Everday&quot; is very catchy and &quot;Fall From Grace&quot; represents the comeback of Stevie and rock and roll, with it's rocky melody reminiscent of earlier classics like &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Talk to Me&quot; or &quot;Stand Back&quot;.  Another one of my personal favorites is &quot;Too Far from Texas&quot;, which is VERY country, and features a duet with Natalie Maines.  Just these songs alone show how eclectic the songs are on this album.  There is something for each fan to listen to here.<br />If you are a Stevie Nicks fan in the least, you would LOVE this album.  There are few times when her voice is a little too low, and nasal on the openings of some songs, but listen to the song to the chorus, and you will be blown away.  <br />A definite &quot;come-back&quot; for an amazing rock icon.
B00003W8NM|1.0|The director David Fincher has been very successful with his great two movies prior &quot;Fight Club&quot;, which are &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot;. He's known to go to extremes and manage to keep the suspense and thrill combined with a good story all through the movie. But this time he broke into a deep barrier and failed!<br />First, the story of Fight Club doesn't make any sense or logic. And this was the same issue with his earlier two movies but back then he managed to pull the movie together with an amazing shocking ending. But here with Fight Club, I was hoping that the ending would make this movie makes sense but instead it was an insult to the viewers!<br />Second, the twist of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) in the last quarter of the movie... can't be swallowed easily because all through the movie (if you watch it back) nothing indicates that this can be valid!<br />Third, the bodies of those club fighters were all skinny with little body modification. I haven't seen one person with real big body!!!<br />Fourth, what is it to enjoy in this film? It is not entertaining, not logical, no suspense... etc.<br />This movie can not be accepted with all audiences, it is either love it or H A T E it nothing in between! And I hate it!!!
0060977493|5.0|Arundhati Roy uses eloquent language to describe the story and life of two twins, Rahel and Estha. Her uses of images is beautiful. Her prose it rich and poetic. I read on until the very end because it captured me so well. In the future I would compare her to famous writers like Rushdie.
6303481272|4.0|This is one of the best animes out on the market!!  If you love tons of violence and animated sexual content this is the movie for you.  You should also check out Vampire Hunter D and Fist of the North Star(if you can find it)!  These are also excellent titles.
B00004VWAF|4.0|The whole album flows as one song with a seamingly repeating riff.  This may be a bit much to handle for the first time Miles listener but for those into his 70s style it should be on your list.
B00003CXRP|2.0|Ive been a long time Tom Hanks fan. Great guy, great actor. I went into see this movie with fears and concern over the fact that supposedly most of his screen time was gonna be him silently moping his way around a deserted island. I was completely bored through almost the whole movie, constantly checking my watch for the time. The only emotion I felt at all, was when he made friends with the volleyball, and they had that split up in the ocean.. that emotion, was happiness! I found myself laughing out loud over the fact that the maker's of this movie actually thought a man/volleyball relationship would affect a audience. Just take this movie with a grain of salt, try to enjoy it, and lets put this Hanks horror behind us and move on.
B000050FEN|5.0|If you like &quot;kiss the girl&quot;, you'll love this movie. Or was it the other way around? Anyway, this movie is one of the best in its gendre. The basic plot of the film was psycho starts killing spreed base on the 7 sins. Detectives got on his tail, killer ends story by setting up the final sin for detective to commit... Haven't had the chance to take a look at the bonus disc, but I'm sure it'll be a thriller by its own account.<br />Note: Best view will 6.1 Home Threatre. Or headphone if you don't have the setup.
630575067X|2.0|For the love of God couldn't they have just left it alone? The first 3 were perfect. But now Star Wars will be forever tarnished. Episode One was easily the biggest gimmick in the history of movie making; the biggest let down of all time. I remember sitting in the theater and praying for Luke, Han, Leia, Lando, Vader, or Chewy to pop-up on the screen and save this thing. But that didn't happen. Instead I found myself slouching in the seat and feeling stupid for wasting so much time waiting in line. Now on to the movie itself:<br />I felt sorry for Liam Neeson, what a pity to waste such great talent. Ewen McGregor was good also, probably just him and Neeson, unfortunately their acting wasn't enough to save such a poorly written script. All the rest of the cast were mediocre. (I'll get to The Kid later...)<br />The special effects were... uh, stupid. Special effects aren't supposed to be characters. It was like watching a puppet show or something. I dont' know how George is gonna remedy this problem in the next movie-- it seems he's dug quite a large hole for himself. Plus he's also stuck with some of the same dumb actors, i.e. Natalie Portman. What was Jar Jar's purpose? He was fine for about 10 seconds. I think as a rule they should've limited the dialogue between real people and animated characters to no more than 10 seconds.<br />Finally, Anakin. The golden rule in hollywood: never use child actors (except the kid from The 6th Sense and the girl from Excorcist). <br />Okay, I'm done wasting anymore time on this movie.
0792833201|4.0|Forget the controversy over who REALLY directed this movie (Hooper or Spieldberg). All that matters is that this one is a classic! If you really think about it, the premise is as hokey as they come (a girl gets zapped into the other-side through a TV and the best route to saving her is through her bedroom closet). But somehow the goofiness is made palatable thanks to brilliant directing and a memorable score by Jerry Goldsmith. I always remember this movie more for the music and it's quotable, sing-songy dialgoue (&quot;Cross over children...all are Welcome...all Welcome&quot;...), especially from Tangina.<br />The brilliance in the directing shows through in the movie's ability to put such a breathless adventure inside a house. What should have felt claustrophic and flat is instead a movie that's fun, energetic and touching. The performances are top-notch, and the viewer really feels the characters are taking this &quot;crisis&quot; seriously. <br />As good as the directing, acting and special effects are, I recommend seeing this movie more for the music. Never, in my opinion, has Goldsmith been better. He perfectly captures both the innocence and horror of the movie, weaving the two together into a truly memorable score. The tornado scene ranks as one of the hokiest moments every featured in modern horror cinema, but it sure is a wild ride thanks to Goldsmith's urgent scoring of the scene and great editing.<br />I would forget the two sequels. Part 2 takes itself way too seriously and Part 3 is just plain bad.
B00003CXE7|2.0|Hyped up too much and is extremely boring, but i have to admit the fighting are pretty cool but not enough to buy it...... maybe rent
0783239955|5.0|This is the funniest movie I've ever seen.  I pray Hollywood doesn't try to remake it, for they'd most likely ruin it.  I can't remember laughing so hard.  My husband and I saw it in the theatre, and we were BOTH screaming with laughter.  Later, when it was released on video, we rented it.  Amazingly, it was just as funny the second time around, which says a lot.  Most comedies are lucky to be funny once.  This is one to buy!
B00000ILDE|4.0|Aliens is not as good at Alien, but not by much.  It's still action-packed, fun, suspenseful, and even scary sometimes.  The only thing I think makes this a little worse than Alien is that they do too much shooting in this one, which is OK, but it doesn't create as much atmosphere or suspense as the first one did.  Sometimes I think Aliens is a little overrated, but it's still great fun!  The Special Edition DVD is great, s I recommend it!
B00005AXEL|5.0|I must say this CD was well worth the wait.  Stevie continues to enchant her most loyal fans, as well as make some new ones along the way.<br />I though for sure that this CD would be over-produced, based on the number of producers listed in the credits.  but, each brings their own style and helps bring Stevie's lyrics and music to life.  If you close your eyes and listen, it is like Stevie has gotten inside of your head and has written the songs about your life.  &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; is so my life, it is eerie.<br />The album kicks off with the super cool &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;, I always have to listen to this one twice, it just has such a great vibe to it.  My other favorites are &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;, &quot;Fall From Grace&quot;, &quot;Bombay Sapphire&quot;, and &quot;I Miss You&quot;.  I picture myself in some plush room in front of a fireplace, surrounded by candles when I listen to this CD, I don't know why, that is just where Stevie takes me I guess.<br />Along with lots of big name producers, Stevie gets some help on the performance side from friends like Sarah MacLachlan, Macy Gray, Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, and Sheryl Crow (whom she feels is like her little sister, how cute!).<br />You MUST buy this CD!  it is a must for Stevie's fans and if you are not a fan, buy it anyway and you will be after you listen to it.
0767853636|5.0|How could you not like this movie (Annie)!  It's so fun to watch.  It has all the classic music, and it's funny too!  Carol Brunett is often humorous and good as her role, and so is the girl that plays Annie.  It's a highly entertaining DVD that I recommend greatly!
