B009RI4FRU|5.0|although they are saying possibility of an oscar nomination, i don't think it's a &#34;big&#34; enough movie.  but it was sooo good on the big screen, when you could really see the right-on details of the 60s.  great plot, interesting, quirky characters, clever original script, interesting &#34;feel&#34;, interesting and beautiful backgrounds. a really good movie, but not for those who want big budget special effects
B000F9RB94|5.0|Really a good movie, I love it a lot, the acting is well played and everything about this movie receives 5 STARS!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|good movie about a probably common problem about where to go after the romance leaves your marriage.  well acting . steve carrel was good as the therapist, and streep and jones were great also.  I liked it. saw it twic.  I think there are helpful hints for everyone .,besides being a good movie
B001GJ9G90|5.0|Really a good movie, I love it a lot, the acting is well played and everything about this movie receives 5 STARS!
B00APUYN0I|2.0|seen this plot in movies tooo many times, a few funny scenes,  nothing groundbreaking  here.  who ever gave this 4 stars and enticed me to waste my time watching it has guerenteed, that i will not be swayed by your rating system again
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Music is good.  Similar idea as the Glee tv show, but given it's a college campus and not a high school, characters tend to be more crude.  Unlike Glee, where characters resemble arch-types recognizable in real life (albeit more extreme), the characters in Pitch Perfect use more campy stereotypes.  If you want something light to watch with some fun and well done A Capella music, this works.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story of Buck, part Saint Bernard and part Shephard who got to know first hand the best and worst of men in the harsh and unforgiving Klondike.<br /><br />Poignant and beautifully written. It really was a joy to read. Time well spent.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Too hard to manage the pac-man.  Even with a stylus.  My grandkids tried playing it but its' too difficult to keep from getting eaten!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|By page two I was smiling. By page three I was chuckling.  By page four and the several chapters after that I was laughing out Loud on very page.  The banter & chemistry between the main characters actually made me jealous.  I was a relationship like that!  The rest was an emotional roller coaster.  I desperately wished the humor would have carried throughout the book.  After the hilarity, it moved to crazy sexiness, then devastating heartbreak.  Then, the ending, the happily ever after, happened in the blink of an eye & it was over.  I wish that could have been lengthened as well.  For some reason I wasn't expecting much from this book but by the second page I devoured every page !!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It s great strategy game. You build your own army and fight for your right to build stuff!!!!<br />  Your also able to become allies with other real players online! Help them out to gain heart pours to use in battle.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love it!!! I'm so glad I downloaded this game.. I 've been looking for a search and find game and its free... thanks
B005HSL626|5.0|My little ones really love playing this game on their tablets - it keeps them occupied and quiet when we are stuck waiting or need them to have a little down time.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I am the ultimate NCIS fan - I bought all seasons of this fabulous show and season 10 was a favorite.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My little ones really love playing this game on their tablets - it keeps them occupied and quiet when we are stuck waiting or need them to have a little down time.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I am not a country fan but this music (and the show) is star quality.  Every song is a winner.  I hope some of the songs<br />get produced on a karaoke CDG cuz I would love to sing them!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My little ones really love playing this game on their tablets - it keeps them occupied and quiet when we are stuck waiting or need them to have a little down time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you do Facebook than you NEED this app on your ipad and iphone.  It is a great tool and I use it every day.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|This is just a great series in general and I was happy to find out that you can rent from Amazon now! How convenient!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Maybe I shouldn't blame this app but I am not thrilled with the camera on the Kindle.  It just doesn't cut it. I guess I was<br />expecting more similar to my ipad camera.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|I remember seeing this movie waaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in '94 when it first came out in theaters.  I simply love this movie -just a modern day classic.  The story telling, the story line, the cinematography, the special effects, the ACTING -everything about this movie is just excellent.  It's a movie that will make you remember why we watch movies... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Love this movie great actors and funny, The scenes are great, All around good, no great movie.Don't miss this picture.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Look, I'm gonna state right now that I love the first three movies (\\"Alien\\" being my favorite of all of them).  Even though Alien 3 is infamous for its troubled production and lackluster box office performance. I still find it a flawed yet excellent film.  The problem I have is the fourth film -which, well... -sucks.  But oh well.  I would recommend this collection to any fan as the first three movies look AMAZING (especially Ridley Scott's film) in high def. The fourth movie -eh, just put it on while you're on your treadmill or something... otherwise, very recommended.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|The laws of physics taken to a whole new dimension with the orbital interaction of objects in space. Very challenging and superbly entertaining. The HD graphics are terrific.Just a game, sure, but  Angry Birds Space helps one appreciate the phenomenal physical challenges of traveling and living in space.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Excellent! If you're a Kubrick movie fan, get this classic. It is very dry (like most of his movies) but is a great black comedy -very well done as are all of his films.  Peter Sellers is just phenomenal -get it!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Hello everyone,<br /><br />I ordered this item the month before the release of Aliens Colonial Marines Collectors Edition and find it to be a perfect match to the upcoming game :)<br />It also came 1-2 days early.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|I did not see the &#34;original&#34; versions of the movies so I am only reviewing what I saw in this film. Very well shot, directed and acted. Since I had no clue as the the outcome having not seen the foreign versions, I was very captivated. My only grievances are the rape scenes and the infamous &#34;cat scene&#34; -otherwise, well done.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie was entertaining and provided all the right thrills and fun in all the right places, just don't expect to be satisfied with how the plotline is intended to dovetail into the prior Aliens franchise movies. It attempts to be both high-brow and enigmatic at the same time and all it really does is sidetrack the excitement and action this type of movie is intended to engender. rent it and have fun, but don't spend a lot of time thinking about the plot.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Look, if you don't like or can't appreciate the Godfather movies (okay, so Part III wasn't great) then move along, please.  I mean the first two are CLASSIC... I'm not even going to go into how good they are -just GET the trilogy.  Yes, even though Part III isn't great -it finishes things up.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another awesome book! I am completely hooked and can not wait for Colleens next book! I love the way her books flow with  that perfect balance of seriousness and smartness! The way all of her books have made me cry and also laugh.  Hopeless was nothing short of spectacular!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Okay, the original \\"Matrix\\" is my favorite of the three -the 2nd movie is good and the third was not good. The \\"Animatrix\\" is excellent -a collection of anime movies based on and around the \\"Matrix\\" movies.  I recommend this -if you can get it for a good bargain then I definitely say get it. Don't overpay for them. Good collection but the 2nd and 3rd movies lack the charm of the 1st movie.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|I &#34;dad&#34; watched them movie with my two daughters and found myself enjoying the movie.  Fun movie, great for some family time together
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It took me some time to come around to read it but once you really get into it, it's a great book!
1401922732|5.0|WOW!! Doreen really did a great job with these beautiful cards. If you're only going to buy 1 set of tarot/orcale cards buy this one. not only will you get on the nose answers/advice you will have lots of eye candy to keep you interested. and lovely gold edges to catch your eye doesn't hurt :) love them!!
B001NT057K|5.0|i have always been a fan of he movie, so I wanted to get the music to it.<br />It is a great house cleaning/excersize music!
B0045KCD10|4.0|Watched with my two nine year old girls. Only issue I had was in the insinuations the drunken Santa uses to provoke the real Santa.  Other than that a nice remake on the original.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting but it turned out to be too much like a chick flick.  There were parts that were very funny so I'll give it 3 stars.
B0091V6TF4|4.0|I bought the compation as a gift for my friend who is a HUGE Bond fan. He was bowled over!!  It would have been great if they had included Skyfall. Otherwise, it's a fantastic box-set.
B00004NRWH|5.0|I love every song on all of their CD's It is amazing how great this band is &#62; in my opinion the will never be a better band
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|It's a great song. It's too bad it wasn't included in any of the 50th Anniversary compilations. I would have preferred that it not be \\"stand-alone.\\"
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but am disappointed with the ending. I am shocked. This book is very unexpected and will keep shocking you.
B001E45XT4|3.0|I wish I could get my Audio 90s back.  This headset isn't bad, but it isn't all that great, either.  The mic on my old Audio 90 headset was WAY better.  This headset is built a little sturdier and the ear pads are nice and comfy (and also haven't fallen off yet).  I am overall pleased, but I feel like these could have been so much better.  Also, why is the cord so short?!
B004UID2LC|5.0|the best so good it allows you to download stuff straight from youtube so I can watch bids on long car trips and on the go etc. WITHOUT WI-FI!!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This as a free app of the day might be the best deal I've ever gotten on Android.  I now have a Windows Phone, but this is still a huge lifesaver on my Android tablet.  I love it.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I am so enamoured of this album. The group has a great sound. The lead singer's voice has a very cool quality. I love when he shifts into his upper octave.<br />The vibe is hipster- very indie folk rock.<br />Just buy it. It's very inexpensive and you'll be so happy with it.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Has great possibility. Just starting and having a ball. Give it a shot you won't be disappointed.  A fun matching game for all ages.
0880796863|5.0|Was a gift for a friend, and she loved it. Very happy with my purchase, and am thinking about getting one for myself :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|One of my favorite games to spend time on when I just need to decompress. I play 4 suits so it challenges me, then I don't think I'm wasting time playing a game!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a wonderful book! I loved it and couldn't put it down! Every girl needs a Holder in her life.
B008N1V11U|5.0|very good. finally a game that had some time put into it. good detail and scope of play. worth it.
B001NIA27E|5.0|Bought this to replace my old VHS copy, A good sci-fi movie,that keeps you wanting to keep watching,Great story line.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I absolutely love this game...although not entirely that challenging still makes me use my brain. Loads of fun tryin to beat my own time.
1451695195|5.0|Very good book. Will read it again, not a book to breeze through. Requires thought and contemplation. This physician did an excellent job of describing something indescribable.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my son's eleventh birthday and he loves it, challenging and addiction. I may even play with this thing more than he does!
B007T99ENE|4.0|A fantastic read, combining espionage and literature. Could not put it down but the second half lacked the gripping espionage drama I'd hoped for, although the writing certainly compensated.
1419702238|5.0|Our kids were so excited to receive these books...and they were a great price.  They came very quickly..right on time.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|The Holiday is a great movie and a tear jerker in some spots.  I plan to watch this movie over and over and not just on holiday.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game for kids and adults to play. It has many levels to challenge you and it's entertaining enough that while playing you can forget the rest of the world for a little while. Great stress reducing, did not find myself tensing up like other more active electronic games.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|This was a good way to relax this Christmas break and enjoy some great comedy TV.  Modern Family is an excellent TV show.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched the first two seasons on Netflix, but when I caught up to the current season, I just couldn't stop!!! I had to know what happens. So I came on Amazon and watched the 8 episodes I hadn't seen yet! Worth every penny!
B009JBZH54|4.0|All of the extra features only bad part is the ultraviolet digital copies. That is what is keeping this from a 5 star review.
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I have never bought a CD from somebody who was discovered on Idol. Phillip is really an artist... Very good debut album!
B004J4XGN6|4.0|The take away in this book is to understand that blind perserverance to a vision is not only dangerous but not best practice. This book pops a lot of myth bubbles around what it takes to succeed, the big one is that if you are smart and just keep at it then you will be a success story = WRONG , you may need to pivot your strategy to keep progressing. Also moving to learning about your market as THE magic metric is gold.<br /><br />Easy to read too.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I didn't read the book but my wife finished it in 2 days and said she loved it. A successful purchase.
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for christmasand she bought it for her husband for christmas....they both absolutly love this item and the transaction was easy and quick
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There really is 132 games. Really enjoy the variety of games this app has. Each game is enjoyable, fast paced, addictive. Arcade style, brain teasers, etc. GREAT game app.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I \\"discovered\\" Lindsey when a friend posted her Phantom of the Opera cover on Facebook earlier in 2012. I was curious and looked up her other songs. I have admit I have a wide range of taste in music and something about Lindsey's music just hit home. As I've found out more about her as a person I like her even more. I can't say dub-step is something I would call myself a fan of, but with the violin and other beats it just works.<br /><br />Two of my favorites are \\"Song of the Caged Bird\\" and \\"Transcendence\\".<br /><br />If you are looking for something different, I would recommend checking out her YouTube channel \\"Lindseystomp\\". Her music videos are amazing. I am eagerly looking forward to seeing her live in March.<br /><br />And you can purchase her album directly from her website (and not pay $46.99 for a broken case!). Give her a music a try and I'll bet you'll become a fan. :)
B000P0J09M|1.0|Don't get me wrong GREAT movie HOWEVER this DVD is not the one to buy - it plays the first 19 chapters and then you have to PHYSICALLY turn over the DVD to watch the rest of the movie.  Seriously in todays world why do they even make DVDs like this?  It's not like space is a problem, what is a problem is that this is not mentioned anywhere in the listing so how would you know? Stupid to say the least - wouldn't pay a penny for this type of DVD let alone regular price (which I did - which is also why I'm returning it to buy elsewhere).  Disappointed Amazon - I trusted you.  Even worse this was supposed to be a x-mas gift but needless to say it didn't arrive until after the new year & did I mention you can't watch the whole movie from start to finish?  LAME!!
B005B0QYMM|4.0|If you're the kind of person who likes your scares to be more . . . obvious (ghosts, chainsaw-wielding madmen, demons, etc), you might not like Grave Encounters. Grave Encounters's brand of spooky is more atmospheric. It's also a bit slower paced. If you like your movies fast-paced you probably won't enjoy Grave Encounters. Anyway. . .<br /><br />Basically, the story is about how a crew of &#34;ghost-hunters&#34; (in quotes because they're actually part of a reality show) locks themselves inside a reportedly haunted insane asylum/hospital for the night. They want to see if they can make contact with ghosts.<br /><br />Night falls and that's when things start to get eerie. An opened window here, the slight creak of an abandoned wheelchair there--the team begins to fall apart as their contact with the ghosts gets too close for comfort.<br /><br />The movie builds tension through the darkness and the sense of claustrophobia the hospital halls provoke.<br /><br />The ending wraps the story up well enough. It leaves some unanswered questions, but that's pretty typical of a &#34;found footage&#34; type of movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have never written a review but this book was great. I started it and was not sure about it. Not because the writing just how the story was going and then BAM! It all came together and it was how it should be. I normally know what's going to happen before it does but not with this book lots of twist and turns. I really enjoyed it. If your not sure take the chance it's worth it
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another really good book. I have read most of the books by Vince Flynn. Just wish the price did not go up.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The book was a great science fiction read. It maintained realism and I dug that s***. I plan to read it again. You can find this book for free, just a note I figured, but didn't investigate until I finished  the book.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was a very well done movie.  We enjoyed being able to view it in our own home, as we missed it in the theaters.  Acting was good and story line entertaining!  Good movie!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Downloaded and was definitely not disappointed! I love how you can create your own character,. Also drawing the weapons is nice
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gone Girl is the story of Amy and Nick Dunne, a married couple of five years. Both of them, after having lost their jobs in New York, had to move back to Nick's home town to take care of Nick's sick parents. Amy mysteriously disappears on their fifth anniversary and Nick seems the prime suspect. However, as the plot unfolds, new secrets about the victim and the supposed perpetrator are revealed, literally turning the plot upside down.    Full of twists and turns and a couple of \\"Shawshank Redemption Moments\\", I was not able to put it down once I started. Told from point of views of both Nick and Amy, and following a non-linear narrative, it is a very intelligently structured fiction. A well written book with really interesting characters - especially Amy's (In her own words, Gillian specializes in difficult characters - damaged, disturbed, or downright nasty and Amy is a perfect example)    On the face of it, Gone Girl is a whodunit thriller set against the backdrop of a broken marriage. Peel off this layer and you will find that this is truly a story about relationships - a noir love story between a narcissist husband and a physco wife.    The novel is being adapted to a movie by 20th century fox. Eagerly looking forward.    PS: The book has some dark moments and a good amount of foul language.    Thanks,  Ashutosh  [...]
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Easy to use, frequently updates the content. I used to use Pulse but now Flipboard is my goto App. Get it you won&#34;t be sorry.
B00006CXSS|5.0|It is a story well told, based on facts and the real life events of the soldiers who survived. Loved it!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wonderful plot, really good characters. This is the book that you can't put down. The mystery unfolds little by little and the ending is wonderful.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Pitch Perfect was very entertaining.  I was pleasantly surprised, although, I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much.  Good laughs.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Follows true to the book, but without the detail, the background, or the depth of story.  Like most book adaptations, fell short, but one of the better attempts.
B004JK61K0|1.0|as title says, due to \\"geographical restrictions\\" (which don't seem to be listed anywhere.<br /><br />as it's only available from here and google apps (which isn't compatible with the Fire) I guess the developers want to restrict it's use.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|...it's NOT just about success at work, it's about success in life and is chock full of interesting and important information and observations that will help YOU to change your life, if that's what you're wanting. Not only that, but Achor is a nimble storyteller and easily keeps his readers entertained from beginning to end...an end which feels like it arrives all too soon! Do yourself a favor and read...study this important book...you'll be HAPPY you did!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first book by John Green that I've read and I will definitely read them all now.  The Fault in our Stars was a wonderful story, extremely well written with fantastic characters.  This is probably the best book I read in all of 2012 and I read a lot of books.  Highly recommend to anyone.
0525953590|4.0|This book is just as much about the politics and funding of the Large Hadron Collider, its construction, and operation.  Which turns out to be interesting.  Explanations of the physics behind all the relevant pieces are easy to understand.
B001U88814|5.0|I LOVE these crocs. I was a late believer with crocs, they seemed ugly and bulky. My how my opinion has changed. These are super warm and comfy. I wear a size 7.5 in women's and purchased these in a size 8. They are a bit snug when you first start wearing them, especially with socks. I tried to break them in a home, wearing them around the house with no socks. It finally started to snow, so I put away my original crocs and busted these out. Since the fur lining has smashed down a bit they are a lot more comfortable. I wear them to work almost everyday. They hold up well in the snow and rain. Once again, I LOVE these!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|if you loved this on your PC you will love this on your Kindle Fire. I sure do. You get to enjoy a few different customers and New restaurants too.
B000GT6KEU|5.0|I'd seen the movie on cable so when I bought my kindle and realized I could have it to watch whenever I wanted, I couldn't pass it up. The quality is just great and I couldn't be happier!! Amazon comes through again!!!
B0043U98RY|5.0|Fantastic show. Detailed and intricate plot. Great period costumes. Excellent actors and acting.<br /><br />Gratuitous Sex. Murder. Lies. History. Corruption. Violence. Betrayal.<br /><br />The perfect combination of elements. What more could you want?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the main character died of cancer (conducting a documentary of his death to inspire others). He was an excellent actor. This show led to the prequel Gods of the Arena. Recommend!
1848566190|5.0|This guy is the godfather of artistic film poster art. This book contains all his greatest works along with mockups and sketches that show his design processes. It provides a window into the glory days of movie posters and examples of the life's work of a great artist.
B005MMYC7I|5.0|Fantastic show. Detailed and intricate plot. Great period costumes. Excellent actors and acting.<br /><br />Gratuitous Sex. Murder. Lies. History. Corruption. Violence. Betrayal.<br /><br />The perfect combination of elements. What more could you want?
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The only song I wish it has that it doesn't is &#34;Who Am I?&#34;.  However, I've listened to it over and over since I bought and can't get enough of it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Series is a period drama that takes place around World War I. Characters are well developed and interesting. There is plenty of drama. After watching the first episode, first season, I was hooked.
B000OHZJKK|5.0|This album is,quite simply,one of the best rock and roll records ever made. Costello was at his angriest and his new backing band,The Attractions,were the perfect guys to deliver the emotion behind the lyrics and the melodies. I can take or leave all the \\"extras\\" tagged onto the double disc set. Sure it's interesting stuff but all you really need are the original songs from the original release. This was truly unique stuff. No one sounded or played like this. The guy had attitude to spare and the music papers ate it up. If you've ever seen Elvis and the band's performance on SNL ( where Costello stops the band 30 seconds into Less Than Zero and has them play Radio,Radio instead ) you'll know what I'm talking about. This guy really did not care what people thought and it's that intensity that comes through on this particular album. The first five Costello albums are all classics in my opinion.After that it gets a little hit and miss for me. There's no denying that he's a songwriter for the ages,capable of doing just about anything in any style,but for me this is the album that I continue to turn to when I want some Costello. I've heard it a thousand times and it never gets old. This is one of those albums that every home should have. This was real rock and roll.
B001GF8WPI|4.0|I have sat down to watch this twice and both times found myself slightly confused and entertained.  The line between reality and truth is difficult to differentiate but Ferrell and Thompson pull it off with tongue-in-cheek performances.  I may have to rewatch this again.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am enjoying this game, so far I have had no problems with my DROIDX.  The selection is good and I can build on it.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Pretty smart and well executed. Bradley Cooper was great and so was Robert De Niro.  The movie does tie everything together and does not leave loose ends.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great characters, setting, costumes and story line.  Such a fresh change from the usual monotony on TV every night.  Can't wait to see the next episode.  Very addictive indeed!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'm very impressed. I need white noise, but this app takes it All to a new level. So easy to customize &amp; mix different relaxing sounds. I've been using the free version for about a week or so. I don't foresee any trouble with this app. Great Dev! After another  week or 2, I'll be purchasing. Nice job!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This was a great book chalk full of meaning. I liked how Dorian had both good and bad influences about him, yet he succumbed to one and destroyed the other.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I keep a lot of product manuals for cameras, etc on my phone as pdf files.  The Adobe reader is the best tool for accessing them when I am out and about and using these devices.
B005D63ICI|5.0|This is a great season of Dexter, and it was delivered directly for my iPad making it simple to watch.
0984725113|5.0|According to Clarence Ayres, a key figure in 20th century Institutional Economics, technology evolves via the combination of pre-existing technologies. From this perspective, technological change accelerates: the more technology we possess, the greater the range of new technologies we can create. Brynjolfsson and McAfee accept the notion of accelerating technological change and provide some valuable insights into its social and economic consequences. For example, they provide an enlightening discussion of how computers and robots have substituted for middle income workers, while leaving low and high income workers untouched (for now). If there is any weakness in the book, it is that too much space is given to very vague policy recommendations. This is the best book I've seen on this topic: insightful, short, readable, and cheap (especially the Kindle version).
B005LAIHZY|5.0|First movie without a romantic interest. Instead it focuses on a girl growing into her own and trying to find herself in a world where she doesn't see eye to eye with her mother. Thoroughly enjoyed it and to everyone who has an issue with the \\"nudity\\".... Grow up and stop being a prude!
B000P7V45S|5.0|I played Squonk for my brother in my car and he thought I'd just spent waaaaaaay to much on a new stereo.  I hadn't
B007KOLNXC|5.0|The format of this show is a continuing drama, so you might call it a night time soap.  But to say that would be like saying champagne is just grape soda pop.  Mad Men is so well-written that it is consistent only in its ability to take you by surprise.  For example, it's not surprising that Don Draper would impulsively marry his secretary in a kind of mid-life crisis.  But the dynamics of that relationship are anything but expected!  Here is this philandering character who has a very hard time saying &#34;no&#34; to almost any woman he meets, but something about this lovely younger woman seems to bring out his more human and vulnerable side.  He truly loves her.  All  of the relationships in this drama are nuanced and multi-layered.  There is a lot of dry humor, which distinguishes it from most of the &#34;serious&#34; dramas out there.  (And by the way -- no violence and very little swearing.  Hooray!!!)  The cast is so believable that you forget to notice they're acting.  And the music!  The music is just as unexpected as the rest of it.  They manage to evoke the era flawlessly, and the music is very important in achieving that.  Sometimes the closing music adds an ironic tone to an ending that just stuns you.  Sorry to go on and on, but if you haven't seen this show, you have no idea what you're missing!
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|I like hidden games but this one is pretty redundant.  You look for the same things over and over again and the characters are annoying.  The story line is also blah.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved Hopeless, but in a completely different way than I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat (the two books that made me fall in love with Colleen Hoover's writing). Hopeless takes us down a tougher, grittier road than Slammed did, with far more mature themes that honestly made me quite uncomfortable at times (or maybe a lot). But the journey through Hopeless is actually quite hopeful, if you can handle it, and written very well.<br /><br />This review will be short because I want to avoid spoilers, and if I even said a little, that might spoil the journey for you. And that's what this book is: a journey, a revealing, an epiphany even, into Sky and Holder's world. But I will say that I loved how Sky and Holder's characters, pasts, presents, and futures, came out through Colleen's writing. This book also hits upon the emotional gamete.  After finishing Hopeless, I could not stop thinking about it for days, the good and bad parts. I couldn't stop thinking about Sky and Holder, and it took me a few days to start another book, because this story was so embedded in my psyche.<br /><br />Bottomline: This is a well-written, heart-breaking yet hopeful, journey through sensitive, mature subject matter, with touching main characters that you won't quickly forget. Colleen Hoover does it again!
B000001DVD|5.0|This album is without a doubt the best album Def Leppard ever put out. Pyromania is a very close second, very close. With that said just listen to the &#34;Metal&#34; side of these guy's. Songs like Lady Strange, Another Hit and Run, High 'N' Dry, Bringing on the Heartbreak, Let it Go, and On Through the Night. I give Def Leppard their due up to that mistake &#34;Hysteria&#34; (proper name i might add). Early years great band, latter years lady luck. Sorry but the truth always hurts. After all you guy's already knew when you wrote Bringing on the Heartbreak.
0345803507|5.0|Don't even know if i can put into words how much i love this trilogy.  I had read the reviews but it just doesn't compare to GREAT it was.  Thanks!

B007TNS6JI|5.0|It is the best fighting game I've ever played and it is my favorite download I hope u like my review
B00ARAO720|3.0|It's great to see Hollywood picking up on the fact that people sure seem to like riding bikes these days and also to showcase some of the daredevil moves that define alley-cat racing. All viewers will be impressed by the riding in this movie and a good many of them will be utterly amazed to see what kind of moves can be done on 2 wheels. That said, I found this movie to be pretty weak. Viewers who are interested in seeing some truly incredible riding should check out Lucas Brunelle's alley-cat racing documentary \\"Line of Sight\\" instead. Don't try this at home, kids.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|I was glad to see the entire cast. I am still entertained by this storyline. I would recommend this to friends.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book should be a required read by all 5th graders.  What a wonderful story about how we are all the same inside no matter how we look on the outside.  Well written!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Chosen by the males in my household. They had been wanting to rent it for a while and I finally gave in. Turns out it was entertaining.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|It's classic Austen.  Well acted and one of my favorites!  My VHS version had sound issues so hearing the digital version I was amazed at what I'd previously missed.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I wanted to watch this since I saw the others. At first, I thought it was going to be corny, turns out I'm glad I watched it. I enjoyed the time travel factor.
B008KW43TE|3.0|the album was over sold to me as the greatest album. its okay but not the greatest. next time i wont listen to the person who recommended it.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|This was purchased for a Christmas present. My sister in law loves Twillight. She was really pleased when she got this. Thanks
B004GYY714|1.0|I was prepared to listen to my favorite talk radio shows(conservative) from San Francisco, but they are being replaced on this site by KCBS.  I will probably dump this app.
0316069485|5.0|wait to read it.  Arrived as promised and in great condition, had wanted the paperback but ended up with the hard copy but that's ok
B009FZFONO|5.0|Definitely more than just a Zombie show. The other story lines are weaved together beautifully. Some scenes are bloody and hard to watch.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Nothing specifically was wrong in my opinion, but it didn't live up to the advertisements.  The funniest parts were used in the trailers.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent book. A very enjoyable read. It was informative educational and entertaining all at the same time. I recommend this book to everyone. I don't normally read military books but I truly enjoyed this book
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The alarm clock works good. It is simple and you can change the wake-up sounds. It also tells tells the weather and the wind speed.
B009JBZH54|5.0|No issue with any of the discs to date, though I have not watched any of the special features.  I appreciated the fact that none of the movies had any other previews or fluff on them besides the actual movie.  The first 2 discs didn't even have a menu to click through and played the show without prompting.  Packaging looks nice and the artwork booklet was OK.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Anyone who views \\"The Hunger Games\\" as a teen movie comparable to Twilght deserves some sort of reality check. IMO, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is anything BUT a teen movie, and it's funny how that is the target market. There is little love story like in Twilight, and the movie contains so much symbolism and deep-thinking that kids and teens cannot fully understand and see.<br /><br />The districts, living in what we would call a \\"third world country\\" being controlled by a capitalistic, \\"first world country\\" is something we see today to a lesser extent. The control of mass media and technology is also a main focus of the film. Sociology of how society is brainwashed by the government into thinking killing kids is the \\"norm\\" is not a big deal, hence why most of the tributes are \\"ready to fight\\" during their interviews. Also successfully pokes fun at the ridiculousness of reality TV. There is just so much more, but when you look at the film as more of a teen flick, this film is truly a masterpiece. Great acting by the lead role of Katniss, nice pacing, and even successfully follows the book IMO. Definitely a must-see.<br />Oh, and definitely not a girl's movie like Twilight.
6305622914|5.0|This movie cracks me up.  Great acting by all.  Love Mark Addy in everything I have seen him in.  Would recommend it to all everyone
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This is a well thought out game in its design. It is fun, however very difficult and annoying at times. The draw and interact feature of the game mixed with its cute and quirky storyline make this game worth playing. The annoying parts are when you cannot draw and use something fast enough. Some of the tasks to beat levels are a little hard to figure out, but with some net research...all is good. 4 solid stars for sure, plus I will look for this dev in the future for more cool games.<br />JL
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Great movie for all ages.My grandchildren watch it over and over.  I would recommend this movie to everyone-children and adults.  Great acting by all.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|This sumulator works well with my kindle fire.  There are enough controls to enjoy but not too many to make it over busy.  You can fly 3 different planes.  You can attempt landing on a land base or a carrier.  There are different views such as trailing, cockpit, or nose view.  Once you complete your landing, you can replay and watch your attempt from diffent points such as runway point of view, control tower, etc...
B007R41E8O|4.0|Fun game with a great look. A good time waster that isn't too terribly difficult but challenging enough to keep me playing.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Definitely worth renting. It took me a minute to catch the mind bending plot, and all the time travel stuff, but the action and plot were great. The ending seems like it just comes to a sudden halt ... I thought to myself, &#34;Oh, okay, that was the end.&#34;
B00005QW5X|4.0|Red glitter lips never looked so defiantly good as when Hedwig bursts in and starts roaring her anthem. Like a caped crusader wrapped up in the American Flag, she is her own hero. She wears her wigs and makeup like a 1980's rock star who knows what it means to have to fight to make her voice heard. Hedwig capitulates the very essence of rock and roll into the less frequented venues for such finery with as much tranny flair as humanly possible.<br /><br />Hedwig's one goal is to be a star and on her journey she creates one through Tommy Gnosis. The sweet seeming Christian boy who steals her heart and her songs leaves her performing in random restaurants where the majority of customers look bored or even disgusted by her presence. For them, Hedwig is someone they endure. They can't relate to the pain six inches forward and five inches back creates in a person. Nevertheless, Hedwig insists they witness, listen and look at someone society often shuns.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was the best of the diary of the wimpy kid book. I have read the whole series and I think there is more to come in the diary of a  wimpy kid series.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed \\"The Racketeer\\" just as much as all of Grisham's other lawyer books.  Though, in this case, I believe that the saying, fiction must be believable where true facts can be just empirical facts no matter how far fetched they may be.  I didn't buy in on some of the things the Justice Department agreed to.  I hope they are better managed that what was in the book.  Notwithstanding that, the book had a couple of good twists near the end.<br /><br />I hope Mr. Grisham gives many more \\"Grisham\\" stories.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is the perfect finish to a great series, it also speaks volumes not so discretely about our current political situation.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I only had this a couples of days.  I haven't noticed any glitches. I'm running 2.2.  I'm able to surf YouTube like the app with no problems.  You will want a larger SD Card.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Great packaging. Great movie for all ages.  Good versus evil always a winner - especially when good triumphs. Thanks.  M. E. Evans
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book captivating, very addictive to read. The story line, however, was unrealistic with a 27 year old billionaire who barely ever appear  to be working, but non the less I did find myself very interested. The repetition of words was very frustrating but overall a good book to read.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fives days, that is how long it took me to complete all three books.  This is a perfect gift for any &#34;WIFE&#34; out there. Got to go &#34;TIE &#34; shopping.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Pienso que es un libro fabuloso, me gusta mucho todo lo de Gale, Katniss y Peeta donde estan confundidos de como se sienten hacia ellos mismos.

B003ODIZL6|3.0|My rating is a 99 because i learn some thing in this book          i would best choose this  book to be in a book store and not just in a library because it needs to be a best seller book and it is not just great it is the best in my family and i sm in love with it .
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|If I could take back watching this movie I would. Please don't waste your time watching this movie. Watch a good movie like Alien that this movie rips off at the end. Twilights better n I hate Twilight. Very over rated movie.Don't buy or watch you will want a refund.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It was a poorly written book. I think that this book is interesting for  grades 5 to7. The main character is very selfish and only thinks about himself. So good luck if u like justice. Greg is only the beginning of the problem
B007B6VOG0|5.0|this is a very uplifting and lilting album to listen to. I liked it allot l would recommend it to any one
0425263916|5.0|I love this series.  It got down-and-dirty right away.  I love this more than the 50 Shades of Gray trilogy.  Can't wait for the third book to come out.
1451627289|5.0|I'm not a big Stephen King fan, but this was a great read especially for history buffs.<br />King gives a possible alternative look at consequences if President Kennedy was not assassinated.

B009ZE27US|1.0|Quite simply this is one of the worst apps I have ever used. You could put your finger on the scanner five times in a row and come up with five completely different answers. What is the point of something like this? This is a mindless and ill-conceived waste of energy.

B0095XPZBC|3.0|I found that any Blu-ray discs from the ST:TNG Season 2 Blu-ray set only play on my laptop with Cyberlink PowerDVD (using version 10).  Corel WinDVD 11 or ArcSoft's TotalMedia Player 3 crash when trying to play any Season 2 Blu-ray discs.  I did not have this issue with the ST:TNG Season 1 Blu-ray set.<br /><br />I find it very sad that Paramount adds more and more &#34;protection&#34; to their Blu-ray releases.<br /><br />To Paramount: Is this reason why Season 2 costs more than Season 1?
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read a few books on NDEs before. This just confirms my understanding and intuitive knowingness I've had all along, that we are all part of something much greater and connected in more ways than we will ever know. Very well written and awesome message!
B00003CXI1|5.0|We bought this as a gift for a friend's daughter, and she loves it.  She is practically obsessed with the story.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Aaron Cross did not have the same moral compass as Jason Bourne - Jason would fight people and let those that were incidental to his real issues survive.  Think of the Russian police that he left alone.  Aaron, in contrast, basically killed everyone in his path. Think of the Filipino guards.  Finally, Aaron's motives were selfish - he was desperate to get meds so he would not become stupid again. In contrast, Jason was trying to figure out, and rectify, his past.  That is much more morally compelling.<br /><br />Very much an action movie, but left me empty inside at the end.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Hated the ending of book one, and fortunately, this one picks up right where it left off.  Another entertaining book
0061990477|5.0|This is a long read, but very well written, it keeps you glued to each page. So far, as I have been reading, it does not follow the movie, but it is still a tremendous book. It would be a shame for anyone not to read this. I am enjoying it to the fullest!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book.  My hubby has recently started reading this series, to spice things up all over again! Not classic literature, but entertaining.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars, is an amazing story that I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for that special book. This novel will make you stop and take a moment to really ponder a new perspective on what we call \\"life.\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Definitely not classic literature.  It is what it is: entertaining. There are some flaws if you look at it with a critical eye.  Don't do that.  Just enjoy it for what it is.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I had heard this was an adorable movie, but had never seen it.  And it was an adorable movie.  The various love stories transposed different types of love-romantic, of family, friends, and how love was shown (or not) in each instance.  All the acting was well done--the stars seems like an ensemble group and played well off each other.  If you have not seen it, worth seeing.  If you have, worth seeing again.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I believe that this book has a good storyline to it but could be better written, despite that the book is hard to put down once started
B009NQKXYK|1.0|So much promise, so little delivery. A waste of 2 hours. I was really looking forward to this movie and couldn't be more disappointed.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|Sherlock Holmes is a 2009 action mystery film starring Robert Downey Jr in the leading role of Sherlock Holmes. Jude Law plays the part of Doctor Watson. This is not your typical Sherlock Holmes. This is a grittier, dirtier and darker version that could have been directed by Tim Burton and played by Johnny Depp. As a strictly Sherlock Holmes film it is below par. The wit and the debonair character is sorely missing. Saving grace is the performance of Robert Downey Jr. The special effects and the costumes are quite good. Still not what I expected from Sherlock Holmes film. Since I can not give it a 2+ it ends up attaining a weak 3 out of 5. 3/5.
B009E2U7L2|4.0|I discovered the British singer from the X-Factor competition and I've always loved her voice. Not all British singers show their accent while singing, but you can hear Cher's quite clearly! I absolutely love the whole album :)
B00005JN0T|3.0|I, Robot (Widescreen Edition) is a 2004 science-fiction action film starring Will Smith in the lead as Dell Spooner. The story centers around a world which has invited real functioning robots that aid human kind in its everyday tasks. One day, the founder of U.S. Robotics is found dead and the mystery begins. The special effects are quite good and the music is very effective. The film clocks in at 115 and that feels a bit rushed. Also the ending could have been bit less predictable. Still, a popcorn film with a bit of insight that can be seen on a rainy day. 3/5.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have this app on my PC and all my mobile devices because it is a great format and very user friendly. I can share books on all my android devices with my PC.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow I can honestly say I have found a book that is better than the movie. Was hesitant about getting this due to the fact that the movie was action packed, but much to my surprise so was the book and I can't wait to read the next one.
B000JQUQZO|4.0|This helped me write a paper for a Classic course.  Getting to understand the old rulers that changed the world can be interesting.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so good you'll cry so if you don't buy this book you should not own I kindle fire
067003830X|5.0|i love this book, it was written in a great way so a layman can understand it and the subject matter is fascinating. Hat's off to Dr. Doidge...especially for explaining that the brain can remap and emotional barriers can be overcome.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|This is a great family movie. We had a great time watching it and it is really funny!! I would recommend this movie for any family.
1405910259|5.0|Great follow up to bared by You. It left me anticipating the next book, Entwined with you (i think) .An erotic love story with muddy backgrounds exposed.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game,. I enjoy playing this although it does get frustrating when you keep running out of time.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|What can I say? Just awesome :-)<br /><br />Low budget with a spectacular result. And a good storyline as well. Good take on the whole vampire/werewolf thing.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics, wonderful storyline. I really enjoyed this game. The length was good and loved the hidden object games in it. well worth it.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Loved this trilogy...it put life back into the Batman hero.  Bale does a great job again and the plot, although I struggled to follow the first time, is good.
0385535147|5.0|Very enjoyable.  I kept postulating multiple end game scenarios and was pleased with the outcome. Another good story by John Grisham.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|If  you have any doubts about this band, watch the YouTube videos of &#34;Taro&#34; or &#34;Something Good&#34; put up by KEXP.  With only a few weak spots, the entire album is that good.  Alt-J has produced music that is completely original and very listenable.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|Al Pacino is amazing.  I have watched Scarface  many times and would recommend it!!!  It is timeless and would still be high on the emmy list if it was released today

B009FOBMBI|4.0|This is not a disappointment! I love all the songs. It may sound a bit &#34;soft&#34; but it's Three Day Grace! No regrets buying this!

030758836X|3.0|I didnt like the way the chapters alternated between the characters. The story was interesting.I didnt like the ending .
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This is a must read for anyone working in sales or fundraising.  I work in fundraising for a nonprofit and found myself highlighting and nodding throughout the book.<br /><br />It is broken into three sections.  The first lays out the current landscape of sales, the second explains the skill set needed for sales in today's landscape, and the third teaches the skills needed to be successful.<br /><br />The book is an easy read, with practical skill building sections (with links to online surveys and resources for practice and learning), and something great to apply to everyday work.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Stardust<br /><br />Casting Robert Deniro and Michelle Pfeiffer was a plus, interesting story line, great scenery. A great film for the entire familt.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Was easy to purchase & watch on my PC had no problems.  It was a little cheaper than itunes I think.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I love this show and I won't spoil it for anyone but it's like the x files but more based one Einstein's theories and less on conspiracies. The heroes are FBI and the there are men in black, alien life forms and jumping around through time and space.  I'm loving it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game. is amazing I love how it lets you be a part of it hy letting you draw things.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I chose this rating because Mr. Grisham has proven again that he is a master at what he does.  His stories keep you wanting them not to end.  I really wanted this one to continuing and on.I actually was a bit disappointed at the ending.  It seemed to end a little bit abruptly.  But, it was a great read and I definitely would recommend it.  I have been a fan since his first books and will always look forward to his future books!!!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|The movie arrived quickly and was in great condition. There were no starches on the DVD, the picture quality was great and the movie played just fine.

B0086700CM|5.0|It is a fun and addictive game.  I wish I understood why and when some of the multipliers and other gadgets kick in...a better description and game rules should be posted for those who are not really familiar with gaming.
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|I started out really enjoing this book but if I put it down for any lelngth of time I had to go back and  review what I had read previously.  I thought the plot was somewhat confusing and there were too many characters to follow.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Pretty good for a prequel but I think that making Mark Thomas was stretching it a bit although I kind of saw it coming
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Good game control will take a wile to get used to. Over all the graphics look good and the colors are vibrant. The sound is a little muffled.<br /><br />Coyote
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen's books are so captivating. Hopeless keeps you hooked throughout the whole book. I couldn't put it down! This is a must read.

B002MYUEWQ|5.0|The original 'White Christmas'. Crosby, Astaire and the wonderful songs of Irving Berlin make this one of the best holiday films that capture the exuberance of post war America in the 40's. The chemistry between Crosby & Astaire was never captured by Crosby & Danny Kay in the sequel.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Outstanding and cutting edge series.  Cranston is excellent and someone you can't help root for even though you know what he is doing is wrong.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The ability to access ftp servers makes this app a must-have, but it's functionality goes well beyond that.  I've been using root explorer on my android phone for years, but have recently made the switch to ES file explorer due to their kindle fire app and added functionalities.  I don't plan on going back.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The story line was well written but I felt a younger teenager would enjoy the book much better than an adult.<br />I was kinda of disappointed after reading the other reviews.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to start with this review. Honestly. I purchased this book on my Kindle after seeing many 5 star reviews on it. I thought I'd give it a chance, not sure what to expect. I am soooo glad I did! The characters in this book are so well developed and three dimensional. I felt every single feeling they felt. I could not stop reading this book. I just finished it at 2:30am. That's how much I love this book. I laughed out loud along with the book, cried with the characters, and worried with them in their difficult situations. This was an amazing first book to start off the new year. Now to just find a real-life Holder ;)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Ive enjoyed this game so far. its pretty fun and easy to play and navigate. also the grapics are pretty good. i also like that it isnt just a hidden object game you have other things to figure out and if you get stuck you can play the mini match game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't even know what to say about this book. It's sad like any cancer story, but it's nothing you'd ever expect and more than you could ask for. Hopeful, but not the way you think. It's the kind of book that doesn't necessarily make you believe in love or God, but it makes you want to believe in both.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong Deluxe  HD  is a great addition for my Kindle Fire HD.  The levels ..  continue to keep me entertained and challenged.  If you are a mahjong fan you will enjoy this version for hours of fun.<br /><br />Mexicogirl
B00785P2QC|5.0|The games here are rather interesting, the real enjoyments come when you reach your goals and see how things expand and your money grow.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|The words may  be a little old-fashioned but with the kindle it's easier to read and joyful with a little imagination. As Tiny Tim would say God bless us everyone. Not just America.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|I had a only a couple of week. I found the batteries ran down quickly. I bought an adapter but now the player is running slow unless I use the batteries. When it did work it did a great job. The editing software is great and allow you to correct the speed.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Dude this is friggin long . Jeeez. Ok I thought Harry potter was long this is all most 1000 pages . ( the size of an eighth grade English textbook in Louisiana) I would know
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This was a very informative read. I was married 21 years and then experienced an unwanted divorce from infidelity.  I realize it takes two to make a marriage work and two to breakdown a marriage.  If I had had this information while being married it certainly would have helped in understanding the dynamics of what a positive marriage comes from.  In that way maybe I could have saved myself and children the pain of a broken home.  This would be a wonderful book to give as a wedding gift.  I think I will make a mental note to remember to wrap one up with upcoming wedding invitations in my future!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app!!! It's so fun and addictive. Once you start you,you cant stop! Its amazing and a brainteaser,what more ca any body ask for!!!! BEST APP EVER!!
B003K025V4|5.0|I'm happy that I got to support Miley with this purchase. It was cheaper than on iTunes and works perfectly, as if I bought it on iTunes. It works on my iPod and even in iTunes. Amazing!<br />I love this song. And I love Miley Cyrus. I'm happy that I can support her music and still pay less than iTunes.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I have read many Rick Riordan  books and they were completely awesome  the way that they are very easy to read and that they are interesting, I can say that I practically loved them all, but the Kane chronicles red pyramid  is the best one because it's based on a recording that the characters made based on their adventures, and it was very cool, so I really think that this book was much better than the heroes of Olympus series
B000YAA68C|5.0|I loved this movie. When it arrived, it was on time, and the DVD was unscratched and it's original case. Even though the case had a small dent/rip, I think it was definitely worth it and I am very happy with this purchase.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|My 6 yr old loves this app, but the only complaints we have so far is that when she visits a friend's world the screen goes black and you only see the pets walking around  in a black screen. And the other is that it would be nice to have confirmation of purchasing/requesting a new pet/house/playground, etc. She has bought items on accident. Please fix the glitch or add a confirmation if possible! Thx
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book opens your mind to the tendency of people to believe that some people succeed because they are somehow better then the rest of other humans. Gladwell makes factual points about how success in reached and uncovers mysteries that you can take as real tools in your own life. It is an enlightening book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was extremely erotic.. i wish there were more \\"normalcy\\" but overall it was ok. I am interested ed in the Christian Grey characters past and why he is the way that he is.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i loved this game i couldnt find mario on my kindle fire so i got this and i loved it
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Unlike other games I have wasted a lot of money on this game is a great time consumer kinda like angry birds you get sucked in and don't wasn't to stop a gift from heaven be sure to get it wile it's free it won't be for long tomorrow it will most likely be five dollars so get it wile it's free
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the classic solitaire game.  The interactive controls are great.You don't have to drag &amp; dropmost of th time, just tap the card &amp; it goes where it will fit.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Its really fun...but sometimes it wont let ne continue. The app says &quot;Error: Marmalade v5.2.1. (300266) Too many controls added to LayoutManager!&quot;
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|This was the free app of the day so I downloaded it not expecting much but my kids and I love the game.  We look forward to downloading more songs.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My kids were skeptical -- I don't think the trailer drew them in.  But, once it started, it captured their attention and was quite funny; more than any of us expected.  Our entire family had a great time watching Brave.  There was nothing too scary about it; plenty of action and humor.  Nothing offensive.
B00846REIS|5.0|I COULD.NOT PUT IT DOWN!!! Wonderful :)<br />I COULD not believe how enthralled with the book I became I read it in one day
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|It was funny and clever in spots, but I expected it to be funnier.  It held my attention -- mostly.  I wouldn't put it at the top of my list.
B000IEPFCG|4.0|I monitored the accuracy over a week, and it gained 44 seconds, averaging about +6.29 seconds per day. For an automatic watch, especially at this price point, that's pretty impressive. If you crave accuracy, your money is better spent on quartz.<br /><br />The seller was MrWatch. The product came with generic papers on setting the time, which I think is expected at this price point (no certificates or Seiko documents). However, the bracelet on the watch I received had a very slight difference from the one pictured. The links on my watch are slightly longer than the one pictured, which does alter the look. However, the style of the links is exactly the same.<br /><br />This watch comes with the tried, tested, and true Seiko 7S26 movement, and thus won't hack (mine came with the 7S26C to be exact, and I ordered on April 9, 2012). This means that when you pull the crown out, the second hand continues to tick away while you set the hour and minute hands. If you want stop the second hand from moving to set the time exactly, you can pull the crown out to set the time and turn the crown backwards ever so slightly, which will cause the second hand to stop (harder to do around midnight). The other interesting quirk with the 7S26 movement is that you cannot manually wind the watch with the crown. You must rely on the automatic movement weight in the back to spin up. It works perfectly, but after not wearing the watch for a few days, you'll need to shake your watch for 30 seconds before it will start to tick. I had a maximum power reserve of about 35 hours.<br /><br />Although the watch is rated at 30 metre water resistance, it probably should not be submerged in a pool since it does not have a screw down crown. If you want water resistance and are willing to spend more money, check out the Seiko Monster or the Seiko SKX007. They also feature the same 7S26 movement as this watch.<br /><br />The size of the watch is on the smaller end since it's smaller than the &#34;classic&#34; 39mm (although of late, 41mm or 42mm are become more standard on men). Some may find this to look feminine, but I've seen a huskier guy pull it off just fine.<br /><br />The bracelet works, but isn't anything particularly special. I planned to replace it with a leather NATO strap, but it's actually quite difficult to find a variety of 18mm straps.<br /><br />The see-through case back is so fascinating! I've probably spent over an hour across multiple sessions just staring at all of the moving parts. There's plenty of documentation on the 7S26 movement and DIY guides for maintenance, so it works as a project watch as well.<br /><br />The Hardlex crystal is impressively rugged. I've knocked the front of my watch a few times and expected to see some damage, but so far it's remained scratchless.<br /><br />The lume is relatively strong, although I wouldn't say it lasts terribly long.<br /><br />When the watch is winding, it can be a bit noisy, but there's just so much character in the packaging/movement. Some may call this cheap, but you have to remember that you're getting a long lasting self-winding watch with a day/date window, a see-through case back, and it doesn't break the bank! You probably can't find a cheaper, more reliable automatic at this price point.4; 39mm (although of late, 41mm or 42mm are become more standard on men).

B005PWPUW6|5.0|This is a fantastic DAC for the money.  I believe its performance rivals units costing hundreds more.  I purchased two of these units about one year apart.  Both perform admirably, though the most recent unit (purchased November 2012) featured a plastic slider switch to select input rather than the metal switch shown in the picture on Amazon.  The plastic switch doesn't look as nice but the unit functions just as well as its older sibling.  Know too that in general  FiiO is &#34;good gear,&#34; well made and of quality.  I am extremely pleased with this DAC.
030759565X|5.0|Have used her recipes from her blog for a while and love the idea of having her cookbook.  Every recipe has an accompanying picture, everything I've tried is delicious, and most recipes use ingredients that are easily found.  It's her creative use of these ingredients that makes everything such a delight to try.
0393338827|5.0|There were a couple weirdos in the world of high finance who just did not believe in the fabulous residential lending boom and who bet good money the other way, and who came out of the crash just fine.  This is their book.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|My gut (stomach) lead me to some of these conclusions years ago.  This film should, hopefully, change your life and the health of your family.  Why are people getting sicker, younger?  The answers are simple, the solutions require work... watch this film.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I loved this book but the ending I can't decide if I like it or not. I would highly recommended to read this book.
B007N8RULO|3.0|It looks like a good game, but my tablet is not big enough to enjoy it. I removed it from my tablet.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have been playing the game for 63 day straight and have loved every minute.  My wife has been playing her own game and seems to enjoy it at least as much as I do.  We enjoy the planning and the rearranging.  This game reminds us of &quot;Sim City&quot;, for those out there who are under 50 look it up.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game, but it is not for impatient people. You choose one of three options to draw The easy rewards you with 1 coin, medium difficulty 2 coins and hard words to draw give 3 coins. Then you wait for the other person (either someone you know or you can let system choose a random player) to view your drawing and guess the word. Then they will draw for you and you have to guess. I just started plying so I am not sure about the coins, but I went to choose a new color and it told me I don't have enough coins. You can take a turn (just a few minutes) and go back to it anytime You can wait for days or play all day. If you play the free version, you get an ad window after each turn.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book until I got to the end.  That is only because I wanted it to end differentlly.  But, the whole book definitely held my interest.  In fact I am going to get her other two books.
1451695195|5.0|the author explains very realisticly his jurney. It is possible to feel his struggle he has  explaining everything from the sience point of view versus what he actually expirienced.<br />it is comforting to read something like this from a medical standpoint. He explained very detailed everything and looked at it from every point and analized it not only with his heart but from the medical perspective. This makes it for me much more credible.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am probably not the right person to ask for a review.  The reason being I have read every 'Mitch Rapp' book written by Vince Flynn.  So needless to say, I really, really enjoy them.
B00899DR40|5.0|purchased this as part of a christmas gift for a couple of little girls....they are extremely pleased with the music on this album!
B007L6VR12|5.0|This is definitely my favorite movie to come out in 2012 - and quite possibly my favorite Wes Anderson movie yet. MUST OWN.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer is very intriguing.  The ending wasn't what I expected.  Grisham earned my interest again after reading Calico Joe.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|This book is amazing sexy and always kept me in suspense i cant Waite to get the other books and stay up all night reading them
B00APUQRPC|3.0|The movie is a little slow in parts but I felt the dysfunction of the family was portrayed quite well.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I rated because this book is great I loved it I would get it  but it cost a lot but it is worth it!!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|The story line was nothing like the book, nonetheless intriguing.  Overall it was a good watch.  There are some fin action scenes.
B00110K62U|1.0|The best part of the DVD is the pre-view of BBC new drama. The quality of the main content of the DVD 'Les Miserable' was impossible to view. Lots of lags happened in the films. I could not watch at all.<br /><br />The DVD delivery and return process was smooth though.
B0012GMW3Y|5.0|thankfully the original vinyl songs are intact, in order, and that album flows wonderfully in the manner I have embraced since its first issuance over 40 years ago. however, the drawback are the &#34;extras&#34; that are added, random noise that don't mesh with the flow, they type of stuff cd producers think they can do simply because the space is there. thankfully, I just shut off the cd when the original set is done.
B003B02O7I|4.0|A superb read from beginning to end.  Grisham has done it again, captivating the reader from the word go.  Anyone who enjoys a good mystery will love it.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|This was a most amazing story very well told.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book right up to the very last page.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have read in a while! It kept me interested the whole time! I really do love it!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I still liked TDKR. I don't know why some really seemed to dislike it. Sure it was somewhat of a departure from TDK which was more grounded and gritty but with a new villain in play things had to become a little more epic I suppose in terms of the gravity of the situation.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|It is so bad it made me want to puke. I think you should never play this game. You no why? Because it makes you pay for stuff all the time. It is so annoying! It .makes wanna throw my kindle fire!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|It was very interesting and didn't get boring. I love playing the old board games on the computer as my friends are spread out all over the county.

0812975219|3.0|Reading the introduction and table of contents, I was sure Fooled by Randomness would be a book that I'd not only enjoy thoroughly, but treasure for the years to come. It was witty, informative but most importantly, groundbreaking.<br /><br />Or so it seemed to a high school junior. I had just returned from a vacation to Paris, and I couldn't seem to understand how the city survived on writers and art. The self-important arrogance of our tour guide on the Left Bank made me laugh. Taleb's apt criticism of Hegel and other chic, Left Bank quacks resonated with me, as did his criticism of pseudo-intellectuals and \\"scientists\\".<br /><br />However, my initial sympathy towards a man who hated this fake intellectualism as much as I did quickly evaporated as it became increasingly evident that this, too, was a self-important tome that more effectively portrays Taleb as \\"above-it-all\\" than offer a treatise on anything. Most irritating was his continued derision of Warren Buffet, to the point where he didn't even criticize any of the man's theories but the fact that he didn't spend much of his money. I wish that was my character flaw.<br /><br />He goes on to criticize stock brokers who thought they knew it all and people checking the markets on their iPhones. I didn't need a 300 page book to know they were idiots.<br /><br />Ultimately, this book lacks any serious substance. Any critical reader will feel a nagging sensation for something more, something worthwhile, as he flips through the pages.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read the newspaper instead.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Took so so many turns  I was almost afraid to finish in fear it would have no closer.......can't say I'm happy but satisfied...what a great series and stories
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and unique you can never get enough of it. This game is worth investing in. I love it and I am sure you would too.
B008XBASVY|5.0|I say that this book deserves its full five stars because it depicts  not only a realistic life but a hopeful one. This book is sure to make you think as well as cry. Good luck!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This movie is asking for the missing link...<br />I understand how people can get angry with stupid jerks.<br />This movie teaches more than one lesson.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I cannot wait see the movie! Wow!!! Such  a good book!
0393317552|5.0|Good reading. Amazing information. How lucky we are.<br />The author writes with style and the presentation is in logical order.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|this is one of my most favorite movie of all time.<br />now i need to buy the dvd so i can watch it anytime.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|A good story, not  Baldacci's best, though.  A couple of misses in the editing dept. (reference to a Buick Impala--should have caught that one.)<br />Good  action story,  though.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Hi this is a good book and I like it.I would recommend it to my friends and family also its good
1591391105|5.0|Great book with easy to understand examples and techniques new managers can use in their own work. I have studied this a lot and use it whenever possible. Recommended to anyone recently taking on a new team or having been promoted to a new role where leadership and team management is key to success.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I personally perferr this dictionary to most dictionaries it properly prepares you to extend your vocabulary and gives the best break down you could possibly get that's y I give this 5 stars
B0086700CM|5.0|when you play this game you will be addicted and never want to shop playing. you never know what is going to be right around the corner
B005SAZ2IM|5.0|This is one of the greats.  Actors, dancers, singers, it has it all.  Donald O'Conner, one of the great song and dance men whom you can see with Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain, and other films; Mitzi Gaynor, sprite, talented singer/dancer; Ethel Merman, and more.  Fun movie.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a very intriguing series with great characters. Can't wait for season 2 to be available on amazon instant watch!
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|loved it, really helped me look at things in a whole new light.  In IT consulting, change is a major challenge.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|the game is fun to play and has more than you expect when its free but every other level an advertisements pop up its the only flaw the game is perfect
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book, it has a different spin to readers be it hard copy or eReader.  Will look for more novels by Robin Sloan.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|The storyline is a bit slow at times, but when the two main accapella groups performed the energy and music was great. My tweeners loved the movie.
B003735VR4|5.0|The book is a good one to read. It came on time and had no damages to the product. I encourage people to read this book.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|The storyline was slow at times, but the key accapella performances rocked! I recommend this for tweens and chick-flick nights.
B00A80SHFM|1.0|My wife loved the movie and hasn't been able to get some of the songs out of her head. One of the best songs of the movie, do you hear the people sing is missing from soundtrack. Don't waste your money. I would return the cd if I could. This is a major oversight.
1439153663|5.0|Very interesting book.  Lots of history. Many parts really make one think about things that went on during slavery.  So sad what the slaves had to endure.  I am a Southern by birth, but still I am ashamed of what these folks had to go through.  Let's all try to make the future brighter and more meaningful.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Best feature is the built in magnet that turns the Kindle off when the case is closed. Textured finish makes it look like a hard cover book.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I bought this for my mom for Christmas at an excellent sale price at Amazon. The only problem was the shipping. It seemed to have been bounced around a lot as one of the discs had come loose in the packaging. Hopefully this one wasn't damaged. The disc itself looks fine but when she watches it, hopefully I won't be writing another review about it. Haha.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Might be difficult to understand whoever the main actors voice was, but other then I loved the movie! Solid plot.
B008I43DYU|5.0|As an outside sales rep, I'm constantly finding myself in need of a calculator and this is so handy as my Kindle Fire is never lost.  It functions very well, provided you don't mind crunching numbers at a snails pace.  As an added amusement - the voice in the \\"talking calculator\\" has a charming Indian accent.  I think it's useful and fun!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|How can you not love the Hunger Games?  Awesome movie worth a few re-watches.  I have seen it in theaters and now on Amazon.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded several calculator apps but this one was the best for my needs.  Worked so well on my Kindle I got rid of my old calculator and loaded on my Galaxy SIII as well
B00846TTDG|5.0|Saw a friend watching the movie and i had to watch it myself.  Very sad, but a very good movie.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Downloaded for my 5 year old granddaughter to play on my Kindle Fire.  Seemed too advanced for her so removed from my Kindle.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I thought the movie was ok, but i personally don't like huge cliff hangers that I don't think will be answered.  So i dropped my rating two stars because I thought it left to many questions un-answered.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I got this game for free on a special and it was so addictive I stayed up all night playing it. I just wish there were more levels/options because once you get through the game, there is no replay value at all.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|Cool movie if you're a Halo fan, but other then that I would not say it's amazing.  Seeing as I am a Halo fan I think it's ok.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Well I am guessing that if you are buying the 6th season that you have watched the other 5 and love this show as much as me! I think this show just keeps getting better!! Enjoy!
B0082GQ5HG|5.0|Take it as you find it.  This is one that everyone got something from.<br /><br /> A night of crazy entertainment. Not earth shaking but smiles all around.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|was entertaining throughout the entire movie.  Clint eastwood was endearing as was amy adams.  Filmed in gorgeous georgia to boot!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I purchased this for my husband's birthday.  What is not to like about Batman?<br /><br />The story may be a little thin in places but with all the thrills and effects who cares anyway.  No need to concentrate hard and the films made my husband happy so I am happy too.
1455502758|2.0|The kindle preview is a joke, only offering about half of a forward and giving the prospective buyer no sense of Hitchens' own voice.<br /><br />Being familiar with Hitchens, I decided to go for it and couldn't have been more disappointed. It's terribly short and yet more expensive than so many other longer titles. It's basically a reprint of Hitchens' Vanity Fair articles.<br /><br />I don't begrudge the family the royalties, however I feel like Amazon is really capitalizing on a man's final words without being honest about how little new content is actually presented. And the new content is scarcely worth the premium demanded.<br /><br />Shame on amazon.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Love the game on my android phone... wish it was the same on the Kindle. Game play is smooth. Easy to learn.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|a great album by a very dear female singer, highly recommend, she has such a sweet and pure voice ,

0316123587|5.0|Makes a person feel that William McKinley High School is real.  Isn't it??!!  Adds to the entire experience of watching Glee and the lives of the characters.  It is a full size, hard cover yearbook, not like some of the &#34;yearbooks&#34; that other fad TV shows or movie high schools put out.  Thank you for making it &#34;real&#34;
B00943SQCI|5.0|Completely Hilarious!  Loved It!  If you're expecting it to be like the TV Show, it's not, but it is a Very Funny Movie!
B004FQX59I|5.0|I enjoy many of Oliver Stone's flicks.  He holds out possibilities to ponder.  I was in grade school when Kennedy was shot, I love historical movies, so I am a little bias on this movie.  The main character, Jim Garrison (played by Costner), is in this movie as a supreme court judge.  A bit dramatic, which is Costner's style of movie, but I liked the premise, question authority and our government.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My friend told me about this DVD and I was skeptical in the begining. I have been working out for a month now. The first two weeks I was working out on level 1 and 2, the rest of the month I was working out on level 2 and 3 back to back. I can see my body is toned. This DVD is amazing. I wished I bought it long time back. This is definalty long term investment to me.
B00005JKG9|5.0|David Mamet knows how to go for the throat and choke characters for their essence.  Baldwin's role is short but powerful.  I like Spacey in most of the films he has done and this is another tick.  Jack Lemmon's role in this surprised me, I thought he would be acting like a curmudgeon but Mamet gave him a good role sort of akin to his &#34;Days of wine and roses&#34; days.  Al Pacino has done some strong character roles but his character in this movie seemed below those.  Not to say less of his acting in this flick, just the character was kept a little below others he has done.
B0049J3QF4|3.0|We are not race car people. This movie just didn't catch our attentions. The characters are cute but the story just wasn't for our family.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Not a lot of depth but I like some of the historical references.  Fraser, Spacek, Foley, Silverstone and Walken are all actors I enjoy.  Walken is so diverse, a good dancer, this movie just adds to his abilities.  I have watched Foley since his days with &#34;The Kids in The Hall&#34; comedy show.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I purchased this movie, as well as the sequel, as a gift for Christmas.  I loved both of theses movies as well as the rest of my family.  We have a 12 year old, a 10 year old and even our 3 year old enjoyed it.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I dont have time to read, watch tv, etc. I listen to everything via text to speech. I saw Kindle had it and downloaded a book to my android and guess what, text to speech isnt on the android version! USELESS!!!!!!  1 star because I cant give 00!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a John Grisham book lover.  Always can't wait for the next one to come out.  This one did not disappoint...it kept me hooked from start to finish!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|For the most part I really enjoyed this book but there are some faults. The first criticism which has been made by other reviewers is that the book has not been well proofread. Several times a homophone has been used, one example being hunting for foul instead of fowl. There are also some typos such as we instead of he. One or two might be forgiveable but it occurs often enough to be a distraction.<br /><br />The story borrows heavily from the King Arthur legend, at times too much and too obviously. The main character Thor starts off a bit whiny and with an over inflated sense of entitlement, however this drops off as the story progresses and by the end he is a likeable character who we easily relate to. The ending of this first book is very abrupt, with some characters acting in a way that clashes with what has gone before. This is a shame as the majority of the book flows well and tells an interesting tale.<br /><br />Despite these criticisms Morgan Rice has the makings of a good author and I will buy the next book in the series to see how this story continues.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who is a fan of any of the many books by Nicholas Sparks.<br />It is book that will keep your attention the whole way through, make you laugh and cry with the characters as they figure out what it mean to grow up.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|picture quallity was great but dissapointed the audio was not streaming in 5.1 or dts audio this the second movie this has happened
B004X4R49Y|4.0|The movie was more involved and more meaningful than I thought it would be.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A great game to pass the time.  Can be a bit on the easy side but still a very fun game.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The best game I have on my phone. The game play is varied from level to level, so the game never feels repetitive. Its challenging enough to stay interesting, yet the concept is simple.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I recommend this movie to all who like good humor and good acting and good creatures!<br /><br />I like all the actors and their roles in MIB1,2 and 3.
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|Interesting read. Enjoyable and easy to get caught up in the story. I would reccommend this but I do like this author very much. Is a little different to other authors, writes from a different angle and I get hooked on his stories.Almost comes out of left field. I suggest you read  The Five people you Meet in Heaven.
B000P0J09M|1.0|Like I said disk freezes every minute or so. I played it on another dvd player just to make sure and it froze there too.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Great time-travel epic novel. I was pleasantly surprised. Finishing it was a commitment. Why are Stephen King's novels so lengthy?! Rhetorical question, I guess.<br /><br />Good book. I'd recommend it.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Oliver Stone is absolutely great. He blends new cool with classic film techniques so fluidly. Even the Mexican music from the online videos was a reference to vintage Mexican T.V.  Benico del Toro is about as bad as bad can get and John Travolta steps outside his normal roles into a scene stealing smooth talking DEA agent. Overall the movie takes ups and downs and you can’t help to feel sad, uncomfortable, joy, and victorious. This is Stones best movie to date.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is amazing.full blast of excitement and it gives me chills.the only problem is that it hangs for a second whole I'm playing.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Could not put this one down.<br />Will make us appreciate every moment of every day a little more. I will ask all my loved ones to read this book.<br />Thank you
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was rude and crude, but I liked it anyway.  I really didn't expect to like it, but was pleasantly surprised.
0345803507|5.0|Excellent story telling. Takes me back 40 years ago. Enjoy feeling so young again. I will read over and over again
B003VANOFY|3.0|My wife got me these headphones for listening to music and playing world of Tanks.  For music they are awesome.  Really great.  World of Tanks and some other games have issues with Logitec headsets.  Logitec ignores this issue.  There is loud crackling in the game and voice chat will not connect.  This is as much a game issue so perhaps one day there will be a patch but for now, get somethign else.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Song is what i wanted, I like how easy it was to buy and download this song. I will consider using Amazon to buy songs in the future

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just simply an amazing book. Read it all in one day, I couldn't put it down. Forgot about eating, just stayed locked up in my room reading.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|What a great book. I read Pillars of the Earth some 20 years ago and remembered how much I enjoyed that book. I picked this book up and read the whole think in less than a week! Can't wait to start the next one!
075669812X|5.0|Book is as advertised and was a great buy.  I would recommend it.  Both 6 and 8 year olds enjoyed it.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|What a great product and price. I got the who series for a fraction of what it would have costs purchasing them individually. I am happy to say that the colorization of series one works well. It is a good job of colorization and it overall it works well. Very nice transfers and the sound and picture is excellent. As for the packaging it is delicate but it works. I just keep the bottle in the original plastic box it comes in. It works you just need to be careful sliding the discs in and out. But I am have no real issues with it. I almost passed on this set after reading the other review about the packaging but I have found it to be sufficient and the bottle looks cool. Hey you get the whole series in one package for a very low price.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Seen many other Almadovar movies and this is one of his better works.  Like most of his other movies, there are a lot of bizzar twists...  Bluray video and audio quality also very good.  Recommended.

B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|don't know if the game is any good because I purchased it but could not download it.  Something is wrong with this program
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Suzanne Collins the only thing I can say about your book is thank you. You brought a life to this book that I haven't been able to read in a few years. I actually cared about every twist turn and tragedy you wrote. For that the only thing I CAN say is thank you though the words do not hold the correct level of gratitude that I mean to convey.
B000W1YYRC|5.0|It is hard to be disappointed with Sigur Ros no matter which CD you buy and this proves no exception
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this author. This book is for those who like mature vampire stories. All her characters are easy to fall in love with. I had a hard time putting it down.
B004478GNI|5.0|Our 7 year old Grandson loves doing these Lego kits for building. This was a hit as it was one he had not received yet. He really liked it and had no problems putting it together. It also had different ways to put together which was helpful and will get longer usage. He ws very happy whn he got it and so were we. It arrived in great time and was in excellent condition. A perfect gift for him
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I've read a few of the newer Jack Reacher titles and liked them. I decided to go back to the beginning and start from No. 1 and work my way forward to the newest titles. Always interesting to read.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|you MUST watch this series. I was bored on Netflix and decided to give this a shot, and since then I've watched Seasons 1 and 2 about four times in 2 weeks. Its so very great. Cumberbatch and Freeman are excellent as Holmes and Watson, and I'm still trying to wrap my brain around Moffat's and Gatiss' ingeniousness. I'm starting to read Sir Doyle's works, and the twists that the creators of this series put on the original stories to make 'Sherlock' are extremely brilliant. I cannot give them higher praise. The dialogue, the banters, the insults, Mr. Holmes' deductions, etc etc will have you completely enraptured. My personal favorite episode is \\"Scandal,\\" which appears in this season, as Ms. Adler makes me swoon about as hard as Sherlock does. Seeing them interact was fantastic, and well, who doesn't like a woman in control?<br /><br />And well, what's a story without the villain? Moriarty is truly frightening.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Die Trying is a Jack Reacher series story that I enjoyed reading. There are some twists and plot changes that surprise you and yet just seem to make the story even more interesting.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Trying to find a sharpener that does both plain and serrated blades in one tool is kind of tough. This one did the job and was about $5.00 cheaper than the two store I could even find them in near my home. We love it!
B008MA83HC|4.0|I discovered this group in a club while traveling in Mexico.  The music actually came off a computer with i tunes that was playing while I was there. This is my first album and plan on buying more.  I don't speak Spanish but enjoy foreign language music mainly German and French.
B005KELW26|5.0|We bought our mother a Kindle Fire and this case for Christmas and she just loves it! Well built case.
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|If you don't want to think but want to see a decent movie with some nice action shots, this is it.  JGL is good in it but if they picked a better bad guy, that would have improved the movie dramatically.  He is terrible.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|While difficult to read in areas, this book was very hard to put down. Very well written, giving the reader much to ponder.
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|very good movie. i liked the crazy twisting changes, not something you want to watch around kids, has some nudity.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn is a great author and I am a fan! I read Gone Girl and liked it so much that I seached for other novels by this author. I had a hard time putting Dark Places down! I look forward to other Gillian Flynn books!

B00871C09S|5.0|I love this movie. Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart are a great combination. The storyline is simple but incredibly fascinating. Love. Love Love.
0394800184|5.0|I got this as a christmas present for my son. He really enjoyed looking through the pictures and having it read to him (he can't read yet) and I'm looking forward to having him read it to me in the next year or two. It was fast delivery as well.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Collins is a brilliant writer who knows just what we want to hear! This has got to be my favorite book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not knowing much about this book, or the author, I decided to read it based on the reviews alone, and I am so glad that I did. No words can describe this book, but I will try. Colleen Hoover put just the right amount of  humor in all the right places, the characters are so developed that even when you close the book, you feel like you know them on a personal level. Just when you think the biggest twist is revealed, Colleen doesn't stop there, and the book continues to blow your mind. There were several, literally, jaw dropping moments.  This book is definitely in my top favorites !!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love it.  I wish I knew how to rotate a picture but I'm learning more and more each day for an old geezer.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|love disney anyway but this was a great movie I took granddaughter to and they each got the dvd for christmas and wached it x-mas day love it.
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|As a devout Silent Hill fan I buy every game and watch every movie. Silent Hill 3 was by far my favorite game and thus when I heard about this movie I HAD to watch it.<br />I was overall pleased with the movie. They tried to cater to fans this time around and it was obvious. They threw in details that players would remember and tried to keep the main cast from the third game. It was nice compared to the utterly nonsensical changes from the original.<br />I will say that I had two major issues with the movie though. The first was the ending, or the 'climax'. It felt rushed underdone and completely unconnected to the rest of the movie.<br />The second was Claudia. If you've played the games you'll probably notice that her character is...off in this movie. Her dialogue seemed forced and her motives unsure. She wasn't the crazy god loving woman silent hill fans would remember from SH3. Honestly Vincent was changed too, but they didn't even try to keep his character intact so there's no point in mentioning that.<br />That said it's still more than worth the price. I went to see this three times in theater with the same friend who also shares a love of all things silent hill.<br />The cinematography is fantastic the music is catching and the characters are likable. They're just not nearly as crazy as they were in the games, a bit of a disappointment really. I loved the amounts of crazy they exuded.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good read if you are into sci-fi. I only saw the movie for the hunger games, now I wish I would have read the book.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love this app, really nice camera, great editing, highly recommend to anyone who wants a good camera/editing app :)
B005LAIGSM|2.0|I ordered this movie as a gift for my boyfriend's sister. She loves sappy love stories. However, the movie arrived in a case that was cracked on the bottom. The paper in the cover was warped at the top, as if it had been wet. And the movie had quite a few light scratches on it. The movie skips around a little, which was slightly annoying. I won't be returning it because it was so cheap and not worth the trouble, however I am very disappointed with the condition of this movie and case.
044042321X|3.0|The drawings are crammed onto the pages and partially lost in the binding and the text is so small one must strain to read it.

B0086700CM|5.0|Took a while to get use to, but once you master it, it is highly addictive. My kids love this game as well. Fun for everyone
1451627297|5.0|This novel was hard to put down.  Although very long, I read it all quickly.  Real novel approach to an historical event.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I really enjoy Dr. Suess movies and thi one has not let me down. It is very colorful and just fun to watch. The kids and I enjoy popping popcorn and cuddling while we watch this. Just long enough to where they don't get too antsy from sitting too long and holds their attention! Love
0307951529|5.0|Since the moment I picked up this book, I can't get over how spot on the author is. On the one hand, there is a whole new way of doing business going on all around us. And yet, strong business elements are eternally the same: you have something to offer that someone else needs or wants and is willing to pay for it. Yes, it still takes work and flexibility, but more than anything--just get started.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Nearly finished.  The story is amazing and really keeps your interest.  I am sure I will be reading the entire sequel more than once.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|Book kept my attention from the start and was a very sweet story though predictable at the end  I still recommend it!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Firmly settling into mediocrity &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; lilts like a flower placed in the coffin that Johnny Depp's slightly better than acceptable performances are being laid to rest. The premium grade fuel that churns Depp's celebrity, is being pumped through screenplays of negligibility. &#34;Dark Shadows&#34; although sometimes fun to watch, is easily forgettable and almost regrettable.
B008M721MS|5.0|it is very easy to surf and handly. hope to have a good experience using skype with this excellent gadget.
B002NJWHHA|2.0|Wife read the books. I have started the first. It is always fun seeing a directors, producers, screenwriters, vision of the characters and setting, but the movie did not fly as well as us or most people we have talked to.<br /><br />1st star for the movie existing.<br />2nd star for the vast effort made by all the people in making a film that fell $25,000,000 short domestically.<br /><br />Although in the foreign markets $174,457,952 is not too shabby. Maybe when they translated it they added a story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is an inspiring novel for young adults that reflects the challenges of high school and life in general. I think that every person should read if not only to read, but to appeal to humanity and understand path of feeling there can be in the world. Chbosky  has written  a masterpiece
0345509617|5.0|I've watched the original Star Wars trilogy too many times to count. My Dad introduced me to the series in the late 80s, and since then I've watched the movies as they were adapted for VHS, TV, LaserDisc, DVD, and now Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I have strong opinions about who shot first, which of the trilogy was the best movie (this has changed as I've grown), the proper viewing order of all six existing Star Wars motion pictures, and which cut(s) of the film(s) were best (I don't believe the 'original theatrical cut' was the best--and I wonder how many people who advocate such a release realize that there were more than one...).<br /><br />So a few years ago that I consumed the 350+ pages of The Making of Star Wars, which was the first book by Rinzler in this series of expository works. The print in both that book (which I read in paperback) and The Making of The Empire Strikes Back is tiny, while the page size is huge, which made for a sometimes awkward reading experience. When I read the first book, though, the second book had not yet come out. I was quite disappointed, because I knew the story behind the Star Wars trilogy had a lot more to offer. And I've not been disappointed! I received this book, the second in the series, for Christmas, and finished it before the New Year, in 2012.<br /><br />** Hardbound vs. Paperback **<br /><br />I wouldn't normally spend much time relating the differences in different versions of a book, but it's worth mentioning, since the volume is over 350 thick pages long, almost 1' wide, and weighs a hefty 5 pounds!<br /><br />After having read the first Making of book in paperback, and the second with a hard cover, I think I enjoyed the actual reading experience of the first book more; it was easier to read the first and last sections of the book (holding the pages down so I could read words near the binding) with the more flexible paperback copy. The hardbound copy (which is currently the only option for The Making of The Empire Strikes Back) makes certain reading situations tedious. I enjoy reading while laying in bed, and while sitting on a couch at an angle, but the weight of the book and the inflexibility of the binding limited my reading sessions in these situations, and increased neck strain.<br /><br />Where the hard cover and dust jacket excel, though, is in the displayability and durability of this book. Where the paperback version screams \\"cheap bookstore stand\\", the hardbound copy (along with it's subtly-embossed Yoda on the deep blue cover--see a picture in the customer images for this product) offers a sophisticated veneer fit for any bookshelf or coffee table.<br /><br />There is no difference, however, in the quality of the paper and printing inside. I don't recall any offset color printing errors (which plague lower-quality prints used by many publishers), and all images and text were beautifully rendered. This is one of the few books I have that I don't think I could enjoy on a digital device. Not only that, the digital copy would likely be a few GB in size if the publisher represented the volumes of artwork and scans inside.<br /><br />For readability, I prefer the paperback. For longevity and beauty, I slightly prefer the hardcover. But, seeing as this book is currently only available in the latter, I have to give hard cover the edge.<br /><br />** Content **<br /><br />I remember the Making of Star Wars being a very cohesive telling of a very disjointed story; what I mean by that is the actual making of the first movie was full of crazy situations and new ideas that were hard to convey with words. But Rinzler conveyed these things in a way that took away the mental burden of sorting things in my head.<br /><br />It wasn't quite so in this second book; in some parts of my reading, I had to re-read a section, or refer back to another page to remember what, exactly, was going on, and who was being mentioned. Sidebars (well, more like 'side sections,' since some took two or three pages) were less distinguished in this book, meaning that the narrative storyline would get interrupted from time to time (almost like a 'choose your own adventure' book at times).<br /><br />But one thing that redeems this is the fact that there is much more original source material in this book than in the first--there are many quotes from cast and crew that add to my appreciation for the movie, and help me understand some of the subtler scenes in new ways. Apparently, Rinzler was able to listen to a bevy of audiocassette recordings made during the film's production with first-hand interviews.

B00364K6YW|3.0|one of the discs wasn't reconditioned properly and it skips. word word word word word word word word word word word word
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It is a favorite of mine. I love puzzles and definitely this one keeps me occupied. The music gets to me once in a while but I just mute it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Hilariously funny and heartwarming perfect for the whole family.  It has become a Christmas classic right up there with the Charlie Brown Christmas.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great problem solving for kids!  It's so good that the whole family can take turns and play.  Absolutely love it!
B000MD7OKY|3.0|Beautiful setting.  Lots of flowers and lots of French.  Pretty good for the era, though Grace Kelly is one of the worst actresses ever, stiff as a board.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|Meryl was perfect as usual. She is truely a gifted actress. To be able to pull off her role opposite Tommy Lee being Tommy Lee was sheer genius. Steve Carell played his part well.<br />I guess liked the movie as a whole.....but I'm not sure.
B0053O89JM|5.0|My wife loves House M.D. and this was the ultimate gift for her. It has bonus features and cast commentary. She loves it.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|I understand the reasoning behind an album of highlights, but the omissions and edits do not make sense. The prisoners' lyrics cut from &#34;Look Down&#34; do not bode well for the rest of the album. While the music that is there is fine, the lack of &#34;Do You Hear The People Sing?,&#34; &#34;Who Am I?,&#34; and &#34;Lovely Ladies&#34; to name a few should warn you to hold off on buying this until the full album is released.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read Nicholas sparks books a lot there all good this book was amazing I was addicted I couldn't put down my kindle the whole time i was reading it it was full of suspense that kept you reading trying to know what happens but such an amazing love story to!!!

1423113497|5.0|I bought these for my niece who is an avid reader in the 4th grade.  I read these books as my daughter was reading them and enjoyed them just as much as she did.  They are well written and give the reader a great background on the Greek gods. They are entertaining and exciting, with action and adventure at every turn.  I would highly recommend this set.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book keeps you on your toes wanting to know what's going to happen next. The imagery is so amazing! You can see everything in your mind like it was actually happening. :)

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a fantastic game.  It's easy to play, and very addictive. I have really enjoyed playing it  can't put it down .  I would definitely recommend it.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Every American should see this movie. All of us need to know the sacrifice that hundreds of thousands of Americans made to free all people from slavery. We also need to learn about the one man, President Lincoln, who had the courage and ability to lead the nation to do what was necessary to uphold and enforce the Constitution. It seems that learning about our country comes more from watching movies than from studying history.  Bob
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had not played this game before, but once I got my Kindle I found myself going to this game quite a bit. Angry Birds provides a challenge, but not tough enough to frustrate. I'd recommend this game
B008OOYALE|4.0|Cute dragons and fun little game. I like breeding to see what I'll get. I wish it was easier to get gold without spending real money, though, as some features can't be enjoyed without gold.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good read.great plot twists.<br />Read it in almost one sitting.<br />Couldn't put it down.better than the first.<br />Can't wait to read next book.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|A great amount of bang for the buck and a wonderful CD to be able to take off the shelf.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book touched my heart in every way. It was perfectly written with very witty humor, and and heart warming message. God bless you, John Green.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son introduced me to this game and I just love it.  It is relaxing yet challenging.  Am now working on the harder puzzles.
B009MO5E10|5.0|Get ready for this rock 'em sock 'em roller coaster ride on two tires. This is the Joseph Gordon-Levitt outing as a bike messenger supreme. I loved this film.<br /><br />There are a lot of neat elements. First time director David Koepp rivets us to our seats with the almost non-stop biking action on New York's savage streets. He did a kickass job on the action elements with some tight street level shots of the bikes in motion. It tracks, though. Unlike a lot of action films that get caught up in the action for its own sake. All the activity fits and furthers the story. Very nice use of the GPS as a tool for the messengers and also for shooting out a map for the audience to see and understand the context of the riding. Koepp has first rate screen writing credits including Jurassic Park, Spiderman and Panic Room.<br /><br />So, what about the story. It involves JGL in the role of Wilee ( as in Wiley Coyote, beep beep) three time winner of the best bike messenger award. He used to do trick riding, but now confines himself to his fixed gear single speed bike with no brakes, a true wheelman.<br /><br />His hot ex-gf, Vanessa,  played by Dania Ramirez, also delivers the goods on two wheels. Their issue though is that Wilee quit law school to ride his bike while Dania is working on the bike to get a straight job and leave bike messengering. They have split up because he blew off her school program for a bike race.<br /><br />The plot gets interesting quickly and mysteriously. Koepp here gets credit for his non-linear delivery. You have probably seen the trailer on TV which shows Wilee being chased on his bike and screaming into the phone about what was in that package.<br />Koepp fills us in with a number of flashbacks that work wonderfully for my money. They reminded me of Tarantino's use of them in Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />A very clever cop with a gambling problem played by Michael Shannon provides the dark side of the story. He wants the message the Wilee has contractedto deliver. Wilee, of course, refuses to give it up. So, we have an establishment cop for a heavy pitted against a bike messenger who wants to play by the rules.<br /><br />And the fun begins with the first of many chases.<br /><br />It's fascinating that the whole bike messenger world is an outside-the-establishment scene. The writing is so good that you don't know if this is just good-guy vs bad-guy, or really an anti-establishment story. As authoritarianism has flourished in the last few years, the idea of authority figures being evil is a logical response.<br /><br />Not incidentally, I loved the James Cameron TV series Dark Angel with Jessica Alba as a bike messenger. There is a slight reminiscence of that off the grid camaraderie here, too.<br /><br />I always liked JGL in Third Rock From the Sun also on TV.<br /><br />I recommend Premium Rush highly. It will definitely make you want to get out an ride your bike - just not through New York traffic.<br /><br />They did a great job on the DVD, too!<br /><br />The film crew hired a bunch of real bike messengers for some of the scenes. Also, JGL trained like an olympic athlete for his part. Nice scenes of them riding and also interviews with the main characters about their roles and preparation. I loved the film, reviews elsewhere and highly recommend the DVD.<br /><br />The director had a really good idea and he executed it well.<br /><br />BTW, I am a serious bike rider and this for my money the best biking movie ever.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Nice toy Strong, durable and a good value, I Would Highly recommend it.<br />My son loves it. Very good bargain
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal provide a wonderful centerpiece in this movie. Gary Cooper plays Howard Roark, who is an architect, designing outstanding buildings, in a city that demands conformity. Howard Roark opposes conformity to the point he takes a job as a menial laborer, in order to avoid conforming.<br /><br />This is a great black-and-white movie that withstands the test of time. If you are a person of principle, you will enjoy this movie, and be re-energized by it. Fight the good fight!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|AMAZING! Only the reality of a God who loves us and wants us to know beyond any doubt that this is real.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|great Movie ..thumbs up...I will recommend this movie and 3d on this is fantastic...i keep on watching with friends to show off..
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|I just wasted my money for I listened once and will never play this again!  I love the score which is outstanding.  No one did justice to it.  If you want to hear the music the way it was written and should sound, try the Broadway cast with  Colm Wilkinson and Randy Graff.  Or the London production recording.<br /><br />I will use the words vulgar and non-melodic to describe Anne Hathaway's version of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\". It is horrid.<br /><br />How sad to butcher such wonderful music!!!
B001DUDKEY|1.0|I love Jane Austen.  I love period movies.  Ciaran Hinds and Fiona Shaw are great actors.  But none of this can save the wooden performances and terrible directing in this movie.  The cast has no chemistry.  The lines are delivered with all the life of a plank.  The constant sloppy eating is hard to watch as are all the cast, with the cinematographer showing them in the most unattractive way possible.  The score is entirely forgettable.  104 minutes of my life I will never get back.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|The movie was funny and if you can get through Ted's language you will find this entertaining.  Ted actually brought out to me how you can love someone or something, even if there are shortcomings.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn did a great job with the storyline and the execution of it. It was a page turner and I look forward to reading more with the same well-known players.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Haven't finished it yet but finding it very enjoyable. Lots of twists and turns & becoming hard to put down.
0547848412|5.0|Great book for everyone and suitable for young teens, as well as adults.  Life of Pi will be a classic.<br /><br />Life of Pi
B005ZUR724|3.0|the game looks awesome but do you have to pay every month to play I don't want to pay every month to keep playing can someone.please answer this question
1451696191|1.0|This book is not for teens and young adults.  It was a gift for a 13 year old, but I had to retrieve the book.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|It is almost beyond words.  Kindle HD advertises cloud drive for photos a[[ASIN:B00A11AN6O Amazon Cloud Drive Photos - 5 GB of Free Storage]]nd refers the user to their app page. There one finds no app exists. Amazon<br />is bonkers.
1452110581|5.0|Although it appeals to cat lovers, this humorous book made everyone laugh.  Dog lovers appreciated it, too.<br />Boys and girls around 13 are using it as a reference.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this book in a little over 24 hrs. I couldn't put it down until I was done. I'm so in love with Eva and Gideon and the suspense in this book is phenomenal!!!
B003OBZ5U2|4.0|i like it because im a tv fanatic i like these kind of shows just gets me so entertained. like it!
0061733199|3.0|has all kinds of stuff.  Haven't read through the whole thing.  Kinda just a filler between other books for me
0316226424|4.0|i like it huge twilight fan team jacob on this one. its so cool. werewolves are awesome so cool. go twilight!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is super entrained and cool I really recommend anyone who gets this game are going to enjoy it
B009MCRHH6|3.0|This game won alot of awards but the game play is just kinda boring. It runs great and has a puzzle type design it's just not that interesting to me or my wife.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I'm really digging this series! The series have a good flow and overall, its worth a read! Especially three kindle version...much more light weight:)
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I wasn't too enthused about the game. It seems a little too simple. Never understood the craze for the angry birds anyway. It's ok to play while you're in the dentist's waiting room. Otherwise, don't bother.
B000FC130E|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much, was not one which dragged it on and on, but it held my attention and up to my expectations.
B008Y1YJ90|4.0|Great movie!<br />Our whole family loved it.  Kids ages 8 and 4. Entertaining and fun.  Would recommended to other families.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I got this for my brother who loves all the Lethal Weapon movies. Imagine his surprise when it came with all 4!! It was packaged nicely and was a good price.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun game - great sounds and graphics - playable by both children and adults.  Glad we downloaded this free app!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|It lived up to it's hype.  The characters so well defined and plenty of surprises and twists and turns.  A reminder that we can never truly &#34;know&#34; another person even someone as close as a parent.  We cannot walk in anyone else's shoes.  An imperative to be very careful of how we judge others!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This novel, the first in the &#34;Millenium&#34; trilogy is one of the most gripping and fast-moving books that I have read in a long while.<br /><br />When you finish this book you are compelled to get the other two volumes - &#34;The Girl who Played with Fire&#34; and &#34;The Girl who Kicked the Hornets Nest&#34; to read the absorbing conclusion.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|My friend had ranted about this movie and expressed that she would love to have her own copy. It made a great birthday present for her.
B000053VAF|5.0|This an outstanding movie and I think it has been misunderstood by many. It is both a comedy/spoof and an action type movie. The title really says it all, it is about the dogma of the church. It is not anti church or anti catholic as some think, it does however strongly target the dogmatic notions. I have watched this movie a number of times (I used to have a VHS copy) and also feel that at the end of the movie it is a strongly reaffirming religious movie if you get past the parts that could easily offend someone not open to the experience. I highly recommend this movie. One of my all time favorites.
B002FA5NNW|5.0|This won the Japanese equivalent of the Oscar for best move.  Moving story and very well acted.  Watched it twice.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|This is an outstanding movie. I have watched it many times on cable and when they were no longer offering it I knew I had to buy a copy. The story, effects and cast are excellent. Very visual and captivating.
1416583408|5.0|What can I say about it ?  I haven't read it but our son who was the recipient LOVED it.  That means his parents<br />would also love it.  Anything about dogs (other animals too, like ferrets, cats) but especially THE DOG!<br />A true dog lover can kneal by the side of his sleeping, snoring, dirty dog, on a dog bed that has seen better days, and count the hairs and say &#34;oh, look at his sweet little feet&#34;, never mind that this is not a puppy, but more like an old tired dog who does his best work 'napping'.  He doesn't even have to sit pretty for treats.<br />Yes indeed, the book is good.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Just needs to have second hand auto play on double keyboard mode then it will be prefect. please add that feature.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This app works just like it says it will.  It found all my local radio stations in short order and plays them with crystal clarity.  I have had no problems with this app.
B0079R8IYW|1.0|It arrived in a timely manner but was not the right size for the Kindle Fire, a BIG disappointment because I was leaving the next week for So. America and was hoping  to use it on the trip. When I called I was told I could only have a credit not a replacement. So M family bought me one at a local store that fits.  Laura A. Gurries
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|We bought this video in 3D format.  It's a pretty good movie that both kids and adults will like.  The 3D gives this video a depth that has to be seen.  Very pleased with this purchase.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|Pretty fun. Felt a bit like a combination of SYTYCD and Cirque de Soleil. But, fun routines. It wasn't as good as the first one.
B004I43MOK|5.0|My 8,6 and 5 year old<br />listened without a peep. A great version to read to young children without losing the author's language or original intent
B000FC2L1E|5.0|It is what it is, amongst all the swashbuckling glory is a totally entertaining story with great characters and a little history thrown in to boot. Why the heck not!?
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My family and I love this series ...watched season 1 & 2 on Netflix and were thrilled to find the first half of season 3 on Amazon! Loved it...can't wait till February!
B008YZXYY2|5.0|He has this whole CD memorized already. He can't wait for the next one to come out. Thank you BIG BUNCHES..great stocking stuffer
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a bit creepy when it went over into the dark side. lol. Couldn't figure out some of the puzzles and didn't realize I had hit skip until after I had done it...that needs to be a bit more separated from the game choosings...other than that, I really enjoyed it.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I  If you like foul mouthed teddy bears you'll love this farce but for me. It was wasn't worth the rental price
B000VZYPB4|3.0|Love the series. Its excellent entertainment. this is the first amazon instant view I watched and was not stisfied with streaming quality.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Great cast, very violent and you might not like the ending. But the actors make t a must to watch.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The lay out seems a bit odd. The usual view is to have the cards laid out horiizontally. This makes moving the cards easier with less movement.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I love Rowley! He is so cute! It is also funny when dad gets the dog and Rodrick turns his name into sweaty.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Hilarious!!  My daughter and I watched it twice and was pleased with the story line and the point of the movie.  Plus gave us some good laughs along the way.  My son and husband on the other hand would probably not like it as much, except the comic areas.
B0051OZ564|4.0|Not giving to much away for those of you who haven't seen this yet, this movie has 3 levels to it. First there's the reality level, what is really going on in the real world, you quickly forget about that until the end, which is most likely a good thing. Second there's the low level of fantasy, a story within a story, which the characters create in order to cope. I guess you could say this is how the characters, or at least the main character now view reality. The third level is just total fantasy, lots of action very anime like, I found that in itself to be well worth the movie. I just couldn't wait for the next action scene to kick in. There were a few areas in the film I found a bit lacking, but I guess it was required to leave somethings unknown in order for this type of movie to come together. All in all if you like action flicks, you should be pleasantly surprised. And there are a few twists to keep you guessing as to what's gonna happen next.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Didn't add anything to the series and was disappointment wished i would not even watched it waste of time keep looking.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I rarely use my laptop for facebook anymore. This app is so similar to normal laptop view and far more convenient.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My kids love anything Star Wars! They love this game. They play it a lot! It is very neat the way they integrated the characters.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|this is a really good app & it could get 5 stars. I just don't go on twitter very often.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|love the game but waiting for the update on kindle fire for the new york city world tour version. other than that no issues really
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|not an angry birds fan. I tried this app & found out how simple and mindless angry birds is. I prefer brain teaser games or mindful apps. If you like angry birds, then you'll like this app just fine.
0316017922|5.0|I enjoyed this read.  It's reasonably light, not packed with important academic studies or applications.  But the stories are fun and point toward valuable insights that you will find applicable to everyday life.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|These puzzles become progressively more difficult and are very entertaining. The app keeps track of where you finished each session and gives you the choice of starting where you left off or choosing a different start point.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I tried the lite version and liked it so I bought the full version.  The game itself is fine, playing it on a tablet...not so much.  I wonder if I can load it to my computer?
B002N5N4M6|5.0|SEEMS THIS AN EASY SHOW TO LOVE.  HOPE THEY KEEP PRODUCING...LIKE THE NEW FIRENDS ONLY FUNNIER.  WORTH EVERY PENNY....HA HA
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Wonderful story, great characters superb writing.  All in all a great read.  I am very glad I found this book.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Amazon has done a good job translating their vast array of products into a mobile platform. The app is very easy to search for items and access your account. Ordering is easy and efficient.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I bought 4 pair.....ouch to the pocket book, but they work great! Now as 3D movies go on sale pricing, maybe I can afford more 3D movies.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I enjoyed this entire album, and I can't believe there haven't been more of the songs on the radio. I listen to it at least once a week.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I have to say, I was really skeptic at first.  There are quite a few good reviews about this app, but most of the time you listen to the good reviews and you end up with your mouth hanging open wondering what in the world those people were actually reviewing!  Not in this case!  :)  This was better than most apps out there that I have tried.  There is really good graphics.  Good lil games and you have to think and go back and forth in this one.  (Some people WAAAA about the need to go back and forth.  I think it adds character.)  I really think you will enjoy the challenge this app has and the story is pretty good as well.  The only draw back is how large it is to download on the Kindle Fire.  Other than that, I recommend this game!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I rather enjoy this game. Still haven't beat it yet, but I've not had that much time. So sue me. Also, I loved the Xmas level!
B001L1S1SK|5.0|This is a smart, funny and often sublime series.  I motored through all four seasons in two months, you will too.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|We all laughed and thoroughly enjoyed this version of this story. It's a good addition to my library of Christmas Movies.<br />It was done really well...and a tribute to Jim Henson.
0618918248|5.0|Engrossing, giving a firm basis for examination of the demise of &#34;godliness&#34;.  It will need four or more readings for me to acquire its full value for me.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|What a wonderful message for all of us to watch anytime of the year, but especially at Christmas.<br />It is well done and inspirational...Oh, it might have its corny parts (&#34;Hee Haw???&#34;), but the story line is very important for all of us.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|N. Sparks knocks it out of the park again with Safe Haven.  Cant wait to see the movie!  This is another great book!:-)
B007KOMTUI|4.0|The stream is good, and the quality is great. My only complaint is that I have to wait for season 6 to come out.
0425263916|5.0|Reflected in You is the second book in Sylvia Days' Crossfire Series... Gideon Cross and Eva Trammel are beautiful and successful people, but seriously broken. They're trying to have a relationship.... Something more than just their passionate sex and similar social circles. Readers learn more about the character's pasts, familial and professional relationships... It helps tie some loose ends with Bared to You.<br />We learn about Eva's rock star ex-boyfriend that comes into the picture hence making things interesting. We wonder if Cary will get his s*** together by the end of this series. And Gideon proves just how deep his love runs for Eva.<br />I had to read this book twice to see where I missed some \\"clues\\" about things happening. I too, like Eva, was wondering what the hell was wrong with Gideon and contemplating what exactly he was doing throughout the story. But in the end, it all made sense and I am completely looking forward to Gideon's story in Entwined With You....<br />This was definitely an intriguing reading and I couldn't put it down until the last page... that last embrace.
B005ZMTAXQ|3.0|My only complaint about this movie is Woody uses the word &#34;Stupid.&#34; But it is my fault that I did not read the PG rating prior to letting my 2 year old watch the show. Now he calls people who make him upset &#34;Stupid!&#34; Other than that, great show.
0061537969|5.0|Love this book so far. Not finished with it yet, but I can't wait to read more. Have a feeling it will be quite the tear jerker though.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|The only reason why I can't give this 5 stars is because nothing is truly perfect. This case comes very close though. It lives up to its name and is well worth the investment if you are looking to protect your phone from the elements.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Loved it...couldn't put it down....the ending could have had more of an impact.....left me wanting more.  So I guess that was the point.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This is my first product of this kind, so I'm not able to make comparisons.  But this product performed as described and advertised.  I'm very pleased with almost every aspect of this item.<br /><br />+The packaging was professionally informative.<br />+Installation was simple and quick.<br />+Performance was exactly what I expected, even works with my USB 2.0, so backward compatibility is not an issue.<br />+The quality is above standards IMO, everything just clicks and locks in places as they should, reassuring all connections are secure.<br />+The design is sleek and compact, feels very durable and long lasting.<br />+LED indicator clearly showing its status and that its working.<br /><br />Overall, great quality product for the price.  If only this had wifi built-in...
B00125JP1C|3.0|Entertaining, but silly.  This is a good movie pass the time on a long afternoon.  A few beers might have helped!
B002EXAB5K|3.0|Special effects are good. Story makes you use your emotions but is too long. See it once and that's enough but do see it once to say you've seen it.
B004SIP7TE|5.0|This is by far oneof the best movies I have ever seen and love the whole story line to it and how it progresses thru the movie is awesome
0689835604|5.0|Great book my G'daughter loves it! I wish I had more to say so I'll say Mom tells me the baby laughs
0793518326|5.0|SUPER !!!  fast ! sorry for my english the package was really good i recommand and courtesy excellent  and excellent
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story line was great, very interesting. But I have to say the book was a little short, and I found a few grammar and spelling mistakes that drove me nuts. I think it needs a little work but it's worth the read.
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|What can i say? Classic awesome Resident Evil. Welcome Leon. I love the games and the'leon' character but the actor that plays him is terrible. Aside from that, Alice keeps ass-kickin!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A good read. Good explanations of court procedures. Somewhat predictable, but it did have a few unexpected twists. Well written. I would read other books by this author.
B007N8RULO|5.0|its fun and easy. I like how you can automatically move the cards by tapping on them. it's different in that you have to line them up by color.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is not my least favorite or my favorite but it is closer to favorite app. I have a pretty big village and lots of money. It is a fun app and if you like games that have money, shops, and animals... this is most likely your favorite game.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Honestly....not a lot happened in this book. I know it sounds like it but really there were no epic battle scenes....no crazy weddings....no giant feasts. Just a lot of background info and plot building but a lot of it I found very interesting.<br /><br />This book made me want to know more and more about the background of many of the lesser known characters. For instance...I really want to know more about Lyanna Stark now. What was the true nature of the relationship between her and Rhaegar Targaryen? I also want to know more about Melisandre and her religion....how does it all work? Where do her powers come from? I want to know more about the House of Black and White and the Many-Faced God. With this book I read a lot more on the Ice and Fire Wiki that I have with other books...mostly trying to learn more about some of the other characters and the religions.<br /><br />I was really intrigued by what's happening with Jon Snow and the visions that Melisandre is having about him in the fires. Could he be Azor Ahai and not Stannis? Could Melisandre's visions have been read wrong? There are so many questions surrounding the prophecy, Jon parentage, and Melisandre's visions and I for one am DYING to know more about this storyline.<br /><br />I loved the direction that Bran's character is heading. I think his greenseeing is going to play a huge role in the future of the series. I think through this, a lot of questions will be answered and explained....especially since he can see things that happened in the past.<br /><br />While this book might not have been as action packed as some of the others, it was still the `necessary book'. Since AFFC and ADWD were supposed to be one long book, it makes sense that not a lot is happening yet. I really think the next book  is going to be epic<br /><br />See my full review here: [...]
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If you played the other Angry Birds( space, star wars, HD,  seasons, seasons HD, seasons free, and Rio) you know you like them.  But here is something, something not the same. The basic one. The first. The one some people remove from their Kindle. Get it for something basic. For starters. Great app.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|This movie wasn't that funny.  Most of the funny parts were already in the red band trailer.  There just wasn't much to it.  I expected much more.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I had to wait all the way unitl the last portion of the movie to even hear the \\"L\\" word (LOVE) used/mentioned. Very disappointing film starring two seasoned actors. Reflects the cultural/societal norms, values (or lack of) and priorities of todays world.
B005XLN97M|4.0|My 6 y/o daughter wanted a doll house for Christmas and I couldn't see spending $150 for the Barbie Dream House.  She loves the Beach House and playing with her Barbies.  Easy to assemble.  All plastic of course so fairly durable.  The stove doesn't snap in so tends to fall down.  Not too big and overwhelming like probably the Dream House is.
0812992784|1.0|I stuck with the book for about 100 pages. It bugged me that it wasn't better written, seemed haphazard, like notes strung together, a bit meandering. I had to move on. Sorry.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Great movie. Had to rewind a few times to stay caught up on the details, but overall it was very exciting!
0545265355|5.0|Great series, loved the action and couldn't put it down, went through them all within a week and a half.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|All around great CPU.<br />I'm using it on an asrock extreme4 motherboard,G.Skill 1866Mhz Ram, and an Nvidia GSX 650 graphics card.<br /><br />I have an aftermarket enermax ets-t40-tb fan, and under Prime I'm hitting the low 60's after about 10 minutes.<br />Under normal conditions I never see the CPU go over 50C.<br /><br />The only knock I've read on these ivybridge CPU's is they run hot.<br />But if you get a decent after market fan, it's not an issue.<br /><br />If your running an older core-2-duo or a clarksdale i-series CPU, it's worth it to upgrade to a 3570K.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book ever very funny.I recommend it to a 12 year old son of the kindle fire HD best book ever
B0063IH60K|1.0|finally uninstalled because of the ads - starts out with one small ad you can skip; then progresses to those you can't; yes it's a free app but at least be honest about the ads up front!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This historically accurate book about the period from 1933 to about 1945 was a gripping tale of evil, heroism, and horror during the rise of Hitler's Third Reich.  I knew it was bad, but the evil and horror that was brought home though the stories of the main characters made me think very hard about the nature of evil and the willingness of whole populations to accept it without question. I was a child during that era and although my husband fought in WW2, I really had no concept of what was happening at the time.  I read the first book in the trilogy and now that I have read the second I can't wait to read the last one. Ken Follett makes this history real and alive through his storytelling.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun little app to pass time and keep your mind sharp. I haven't had any problems with it on my Kindle Fire HD.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Team of Rivals is a great historical novel that is fascinating and filled with information about the US and the political in and outs before and during the Civil War.  It is a well written and very readable book
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My 7 1/2 year old son was thrilled to get this for christmas.  He loves the characters and was excited to have the Temple of Light.
B00422LESO|4.0|we all wish for a mr darcy and this was a great idea for a vacation<br />a modern take on p and p ..and it was a fun read
B003O86FMW|5.0|It only took three days to read this one. I loved every minute. I remember finding myself do lost in the book I thought I was her
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Continues in the genre of Jack Ryan novels.Has merged two themes in this book. what you would expect from author. compelling and easy read.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My 12 year-old daughter received this for Christmas, and she loved it. It is totally age-appropriate.  She says it is just as great as &#34;Up All Night&#34;(first album)
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I saw my friend playing with a drawing app on one of the Windows 8 touch screens at Best Buy and thought it was pretty neat. So I ended up checking out drawing apps for the Kindle Fire HD and found this. It's a lot of fun to use. My 3 year old sister and 2 year old cousin were able to navigate it easily, selecting brushes, pencils, erasers, stickers and different colors with ease.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is both very relaxing and very addictive. You can play for hours when you have time to kill.
B008KGPEQG|5.0|A simply brilliant book, one of my favourite memoirs of all time without a doubt! Paul Auster is the real deal!
B004WMKXWM|4.0|Never disappointed with this series. Obviously the books are better, but I love that they broke this last book up to allow for the details that would have been lost in just one movie. Can't wait to finally watch part 2.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|No need to tell you this is one of the best movies ever created. What could you expect, when SERGIO LEONE makes another WESTERN with music by ENNIO MORRICONE and invites CLAUDIA CARDINALE and HENRY FONDA to star in it? An absolutely timeless masterpiece, that's what.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This really is a great show. I was hearing all the hype, and shows don't always live up to the hype they get from media and the lemmings that just watch everything, and was pleasantly surprised at how much I love this show now.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|This famous documentary is not only remembered as the very first 'fly on the wall docu' (making it a very influential piece of art) but also as one of the moste innovative and enjoyable rockfilms ever. Fans of the enigmatic Bob Dylan could not get closer to his fascinating persona than through this film. Absolutely deligthful to see!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I waited a long time for a boxed set of all 3 movies to come out. The only negative in this purchase is the inner box construction, it can be difficult to get some of the discs out. It felt like I was about to break them. Otherwise, no issues and worth the wait and money!
B008I34ZFW|5.0|Product arrived in a timely manner.  The item was in excellent condition.  It is a movie that would be difficult to get elsewhere.  I found the movie very funny.  Granted the topic doesn't have universal appeal.  The R rating is exclusively for language.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Page turner. Could not put this down. You will never figure out the ending. All of her books are like this. Excellent read. Though not for the faint of heart.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Last night I had math homework. I had to find all the factors for 25 different numbers. Maybe you could put a factor finder on the app. I'm not complaint, I did enjoy this app.
B00138CYD4|5.0|Being a lover of Santanas music, I really enjoyed this album. Being able to hear some of his old and new songs with other artist was wonderful! Very worth it!
1451648537|5.0|This is a excellent book on one of the icons of last century.  Jobs is a fascinating man and this book captures him warts and all. That Steve read Autobiography of a Yogi every year is an example of the level of intimacy this book furnishes.
0380789035|5.0|Shadow gets out of prison only to find that his beloved wife is dead. He then takes a job from a strange old con-man in which he learns that all the gods, new and old, are real; they want to use him as a pawn in a dangerous game where dreams and magic shape reality, and he isn't being told the rules. He learns that coins can save or condemn, but in the end are just tools in a shell-game. Shadow also learns that his wife will always be there for him when he needs her most, even after her death. &#34;American Gods&#34; is a strange and uplifting journey through the history, legends, side-shows and small towns of the United States of America, as well as a personal grief process, through which a man finds himself again.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I'm very happy with this purchase! A great movie! My order came quickly and the quality is awesome!!! Very happy!!!
0380789019|5.0|Gaiman's dark re-imagining of Lewis Carroll's &#34;Alice in Wonderland&#34; is set in present-day London and its unseen other side, made up of people and places which have fallen through the cracks, with a male protagonist who passes through disbelief, fear and bewilderment at a world he doesn't understand to find his spine - and himself. This should be required reading for young adults.
1423101502|5.0|everything was great. We are excited to read this book, my son and I, together. He recieved it as a Christmas gift.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Amazon,<br /><br />Thanks for the excellent shipping price and service. The box came to me almost untouched and incredibly fast.<br />You're the best.<br /><br />I'm from Brazil and I loved it. There's not even a simple thing in that box that I had disliked.
1423101499|5.0|everything was great. We are excited to read this book, my son and I, together. He recieved it as a Christmas gift.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I was really impressed with the price and the condition of this 2 disc Edition of the Lion King!  Thank you so much for making my Christmas shopping cheaper and I know that my little nephew will love the movie!
B001HN6918|5.0|First off this movie is so funny! It arrived super fast and was exactly what I had ordered. Great job
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Took me a few days to beat. Great graphics, good story line. Wish it were a little longer though, esp being a paid app.
B006TTC57C|5.0|First off this movie is so funny! It arrived super fast and was exactly what I had ordered. Great job
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a very good story. I laughed and cried.  I know it hit home for a few people. Hope I find more love stories like this.
B0013UIUBC|4.0|I enjoyed this film....it seems that this fil must have different versions as I remember seeing it in the past with a different ending and also a couple of missing scenes. But even so it was a good film to watch if one gets tired pof blood and gore.  The lead actors played off one another quite well, there was chemistry between them.  If you liked &#34;Julia and Julie&#34;(? I cannot remember the exact name of that film ) then I suspect that you will enjoy this one also.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was funny. I loved the book it was so easy.<br />Some words were hard to pronounce. I liked when Greg asked a girl to the dance.
0316056863|5.0|and hope she would write another-<br />It is such a feel good and humorous memoir. I can almost hear her voice reading them. Tina Fey knows how to use words cleverly... I find her style of writing charming...and delightful as well. I had fun reading her book and actually reading it for the second time. I personally would recommend it to everyone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it's so time consuming and awesome you must pay and become and addict this is awesome how you love it to :)
B0041OOEJY|4.0|I like this movie.<br />Action , sentimentality, and a happy ending.<br />I miss jackie Chan and his martial arts/stunts. It was limited here but still good.<br />Jaden is a cutie and a good actor, My neice of 13yr liked the movie.

B000SEI230|1.0|I read this, against my better judgment, because of the setting.  WHLE I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book, it degenerated quickly into typical maudlin Nicholas Sparks during the second half which I did finish by reading only topic sentences.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|It was fast, I got it in 3 days.... The tool is excellent... I have use it for everything... I love it. I
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Love it but I don't like how you can only get friends by Facebook.My parents won't let me have it till I'm 18:(
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very unpredictable but I love it! Would highly recommend this series.  Can't wait to start \\"Mockinjay\\". I love this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I heard that the second book was not good as the first but I completely disagree. This book had me on the edge of my seat just as much as the first did. I never saw the ending coming and I look forward to reading the final book of the series!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Still can't put the books down and almost read the series. This is a great book 4.<br />About to buy the next one.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Amazing!!! I absolutely love this book. Such love and passion. I would recommend it 100 times. Definitely intend on reading more books by this author. Hope they can compare.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAMES IS AWESOME!GIT THIS GAME!!<br />You can collect coins and,thou can jump up trains and run away from the bad guy.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I know that I had to have read this book in High School or in College, because the nuns that I had would have seen to it. I don't remember enjoying it then, but I enjoyed it this time. I re-read it over the last few days and truly fell in love with both the story and the author. Reading a classic as an adult, especially a \\"senior\\" adult, brings an entirely different prospective to the story and how you relate to the story. When I was younger, there were very few gray areas in my life. Things were done a certain way, and you believed in  proscribed manor. I found my heart breaking when Javert could not the see the gray area in Valjean's life and thus sealed his own fate. I found myself, hoping against hope, that he would not come to the end that he did. I now have, and see, many gray areas in my life and other's, and I understand life and people differently. There were so many other characters in the story that also stayed in their own comfort zone of black and white, too many to name here.<br /><br />The selfless love that Jean Valjean showed to all who came in his life inspired a sense of wonder in me that no other story has ever been able to. I saw the movie a few days ago and found myself crying at the end, I also found myself crying at the end of the book. Both the book and the movie tell a timeless story that I pray people will be open to.<br /><br />I know that it is along, detail rich book, but I hope that you read the book with an open mind, for the story telling style of the author, and with an open heart to the story. I know that I will find myself re-reading this book time and again an I know that I will take something different away each time I read it.<br /><br />Thank you Victor Hugo
0374214913|4.0|Debut novels often disappoint me because they can be stuffed with so many elements that a writer has been struggling to express. The restraint and economy in Robin Sloan's Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore stood out for me. Sloan tells a story well, keeping up plot momentum and providing effective character development. At its core, this novel is a story of the power of friendship, and Sloan is clever in the ways he uses protagonist Clay Jannon as a bridge from the print books of the past to the digital future. Readers who like puzzles and who enjoy books that are fun to read are those most likely to enjoy this one.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I remember the first Total Recall and always thought that was good. But if I was to watch the old one again after seeing this one, I would be dissapointed. The new version is more modernized and better special effects. The acting is good. The costumes are better. Comparing the two, the old one seems more cheesy, I always liked the story so for me it was good. Thanks.
1400067820|2.0|Taleb's made-up words, including the title, and quirky showmanship turned me off. Skim a sample to see if you like it. I picked up Antifragile because I liked reading The Black Swan, but I put it aside after about fifteen minutes.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I bought this for my wife about 6 months ago and it's still her favorite cd.  Its full of great songs.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|If you've never seen this movie, watch it. Ayn Rand is right on target. It's to bad her writings are not required reading in all classrooms.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|By far the most complete and essential ZZ compilation available, if you love ZZ you will truly dig this disc.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A page turner from beginning to end. Reacher is a total badass! Not a good idea to mess around with him.
030758836X|5.0|This book came in perfect condition on time.  I'm looking forward to reading it. A friend is teaching it in a college class; it was chosen by her students as their favorite &#34;literary best seller&#34; to study.
B0094K35S6|5.0|The Matrix is one of my favorite sci fi movies of all time.  It introduced the slow motion fight scenes, has a great techno soundtrack, introduces a new twist on machines taking over, and living in a computer.  It's a must see.
B008B1W3V4|2.0|Bought this MP3 Album on sale.  Unfortunately the low price was the only good thing about this album.  They should rename it, &#34;Adam Levine's Techno Extravaganza&#34;.  Major fail, Maroon 5.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The Preston and Child Pendergast books are always great fun. The plots are outlandish, but the writing is always superior. This one involves at least three sub-plots involving different characters, each faced with a hopeless life-threatening situation at least once. This one shakes Pendergast to his core from start to finish. We also learn more about his &#34;old&#34; ward. Enough said, read the book. It's long, but it won't take long.
B0094K1K42|1.0|Not sure what is funny about this movie - character is pitiful and depressing. Really tough to watch and I didn't laugh once.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|My husband and I can hardly wait for the second season.  It is a much watch show and the cast is wonderful Don!t miss it.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|I bought this to carry/store/protect my JVC GZ-HM550 camcorder, which is about as long and 2/3 the diameter of a soft drink can. The Lowepro case is sturdy, well padded, with a heavy zipper and an elastic strap inside to keep the camera in place.  Also has an adjustable exterior strap to fit the hand or slide a belt through.  It's the perfect size for just the camera and a spare battery, perhaps a couple of spare SD memory cards.<br /><br />If you're looking for a case to store/carry all your cables, charger, A/C power cord, accessories, etc., choose a larger case.  This one is perfect for my needs.
B000002KCF|5.0|From the first note to the last, this is one of the most perfect albums by anyone....and as a debut simply stunning.<br />I have very eclectic taste in music but Michael Franks, especially his early work (first three albums) can be enjoyed and appreciated by nearly everyone.  It is a perfect soundtrack for a mixed crowd cocktail party - or a special evening with a lover.<br />Romantic and intelligent, with the then top notch Crusaders Jazz Band as unbilled (on cover) back up band, the writing and playing is simply superb. Those guys recognized great music when they saw/heard it even though Franks was relatively unknown before this masterpiece.<br />I recommend buying Sleeping Gypsy at the same time - you will want it once you fall in love with the Art of Tea - and then you'll likely want Tiger in the Rain - this early work is nearly flawless and is in the top echelon of my music collection which includes thousands of carefully chosen titles!
B00AW735QC|4.0|The season started off strong then tapered but if it continues in this direction I will be pleased. This episode was great, although I have to admit I am one that roots for the good guy. Something I enjoy about this series is that the good guys don't always prosper so when they do it gives me a little high. I cannot wait till next week.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is challenging and fun.  I am enjoying it.  I wish you had other kinds of solitaire.  Thank you for this one.
B00005N6KG|5.0|They are every bit as good as the old headphones and I like the black color over the white ones i had.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|I loved the last Halo movie and I thought this one was really going to be good it was not.  It was not animation like  the video game it was live action and the plot was not good too much time on the school and not enough of a real story and the actors was not good.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Pretty cool game so far. It was free so just playing it to pass time. Graphics are better than expected.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game. I hate the requirement of 30 words. It doesn't take 30 words to express approval or disappointment.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love to game but would like it if it was mare like the Pc version.  cant do any thing with redestone. and there are no wolves and limited crafting. I like the game though the Pc has more options.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love this game. I hate the requirement of 30 words. It doesn't take 30 words to express approval or disappointment.
B0086700CM|3.0|Sometimes it wont turn when you try to turn and it's frustrating.  I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it's still doing the same thing. It does that on more than one device.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|first time downloading any app.  took awhile to figure out how to change C to F but worked out ok. easy to follow
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids love to play this game.  They play it on my Kindle fire.  They are 8 and 5 years old.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It has New towers New upgrades and every thing a game needs it even has fantasy too and it rocks awesomely
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game ....It is free...it is fun...it is easy..(.most of time)...it can be addictive...get it...and see for yourself...you might enjoy it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I don't know how I could love Evernote any more than I do.  I mean, I've always been a Mac User.  Last Christmas, my husband bought me a Kindle Fire HD, and my first concern was if I could download an Evernote app for it!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Must read for anyone.<br />True Mitch Albom.<br />Highly addictive and thought provoking.<br />If you don't finish this book and come out a changed person than you didn't read all of it. Truely a great book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A bit too neat and contrived. Still a must too finish the series. In the end hope remained a Constant.
B0079XNWQA|3.0|We discovered Mraz and company when he opened for Jewel many years ago, right before \\"The Remedy\\" took over the FMs.  I enjoy his uptempo cuts and introspective, future-minded lyrics over his slower songs, and so this album is not a favorite since it is slower than his previous outings.  Our least favorite Mraz concert was our most recent one, mainly because he jammed slowly on album cuts and we felt the concert lacked energy, although it certainly did not lack spirit (or talent).  We thought it was a poorly paced set, and I think this album suffers from that same issue.  I'm happy Mraz has the guts and facilities to release work that he is proud of, but for me, this one is not a great one.  Not optimistic that it will get many more plays for me.
1439102430|4.0|I enjoy this author and request her books as soon as they show up in the library system.  This book was well paced and well written.  I enjoyed the mystery and especially the way that Tempe gets involved in every aspect.  When she was roped and fell into the cold pond, it was so vivid I could feel the frigid water hitting my face.<br /><br />I missed the romance level between Tempe and Ryan, of course that has been missing for a few books now.  I wish that Kathy would decide to get them back together or allow Tempe and Ryan someone else to love.  Tempe cannot be happy with her lonely, crazy life....someone to snuggle with at night in the cold Canada winters is needed for her to be happy.<br /><br />I enjoy this series and this author.  4 stars...I want them to get back together.
B008SVFX96|5.0|I'm a pretty big Bon Jovi fan and we've seen them in concert several times; I think Jon is incredibly talented and that Richie is equally talented in different ways.  Last time we saw them, Richie's version of \\"Lay Your Hands On Me\\" really intrigued me to think of him as a lead vocalist (I don't have his earlier albums) and so I was psyched for this release.  The introspective lyrics are interesting and moderately provocative into his recent past, and the music is awesome.  His vocals are very impressive here, if not surprisingly good if you compare them to the few notes you hear in a BJ concert and/or his (very passable) attempt to belt out a BJ classic that was clearly written for their 20-years-ago voices.  After several listens, I'm happy with this one.  Give it a try if you're a BJ fan and enjoy it's slightly edgier feel and more pronounced guitar work over a BJ release.
1475143389|5.0|As someone who has been to the gym a couple times but never really knew what he was doing, this book gave me the foundational understanding of both nutrition and weights. This has enabled me to make my time in the gym more efficient and maximize gains by eating the right things before and after.<br /><br />Also, Mike has provided an uparalleled level of customer service by personally answering my questions via email.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough due to the valuable information and access to Mike's personal knowledge.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really enjoyed this novel and look forward to watching the movie!  You won't be disappointed and would recommend for book clubs!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Action, realism, unpredictability.  My wife and I enjoyed the whole series in a week's worth of streaming.  Not for kids.
B00008CMR6|5.0|Great movie. Husband loved the Christmas presets, he is a John Wayne movie collector. Still looking for more. Try them

B006BDHAX0|4.0|Found I get very involved with this game and can &#34;eat up a half hour in no time&#34; it seems.<br />Like to use as a distraction at the end of the day from daily stressors.<br />Would recommend for increasing eye-hand coord.

B00A17AD36|5.0|I can let this album ride!  At first I wasn't digging a couple songs, but after actually listening to them I can relate to them.  The Weeknd goes from shy introvert to loving his woman to missing his woman with a few stops in between.
6305754969|5.0|Great movie. Husband loved the Christmas presets, he is a John Wayne movie collector. Still looking for more. Try them
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this book was beautifully written. Full of complex drama and rebellion in both Katniss' relationships and her feelings about a skewed political system,The Hunger Games is impossible to put down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I have read every Nicholas Sparks book and this one, for me, is up there with my favorite A Walk to Remember. I liked the suspense in the book something a little different from the others. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to read a touching love story.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|It was great having these episodes all in I've place. I think I watched them all in two days! Everything was perfect!
B008HK3S9K|5.0|Really cute and great for the kindle fire. Not bulky. Kindle fits securely and feels safe. My daughter loved it.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|Fantastic, and if you don't want to jump up and dance after watching this, there's something wrong with ya! Highly recommended.
030771652X|5.0|Again, the book was in the shape I expected for the very low price I paid.  I have never been disappointed with anything I have purchased from Amazon.  It is the way to go!!!!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I didn't really care for it didn't seem to be a challenge or maybe I just didn't understand how to use it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This has a nice smooth rubber feel. Cleans easy, fits perfect and stands up as indicated very pleased. Will recommend to family and freinds
B001EN71CW|5.0|It really is worth it to upgrade to the picture quality of Blu-Ray in this case.  I did originally have some issues playing the special features, but doing a software update on my player took care of that.  This isn't a purchase I regret.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Not exactly like the book but simillar. I enjoyed the movie but I wish I had not read the book first.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|This was the last thing I bought my brother before he was killed less than a month later.  I'm sure the films still hold up, but I could never bring myself to watch them.  It's been years, though.  Maybe it's time to dig them out.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|A good movie with a lot of twists and turns. You stay on the edge of your seats waiting for the next move.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|The issue was finally resolved months later, condescendingly, but resolved. The series itself is rather fun if you don't count the last two seasons.  Check out Bunheads.  Same creator and similar aesthetic.
B00ARAO720|5.0|We enjoyed this movie. It was an exciting ride. Lots of action, great twists and turns.A good choise to watch.
031606792X|3.0|I was with her for a while despite the poor writing. The ending of this book made me climb off the crazy train, however.  Fan Fiction at best.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is well worth watching. A funny movie keeping your attention and is well worth the time to watch, we enjoyed it very much.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|If there happened to be a better singer for the part of Marius, there would be one more star.  What can I say?  I love this presentation, especially all the Jean Valjeans at the end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show! Great story line and well written it will make you addicted to the series watch them all strongly suggested.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I really think this is best movie ever made. Colors and everything is so great. No bad stuff in this movie at all.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I got this for my sister as a gift and she plays it every single day. I can't stand it anymore, but she loves it. I do really like the &#34;Locked Out of Heaven&#34; track and I do like that his music has somewhat of and &#34;old soul&#34; unlike most of todays garbage that is put out. I just getting tired of hearing it everyday but it is a good album. I would recommend this album. I would strongly recommend this album to those who are sick and tired of the trash called music these days.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|needs more mini games but us a fun interesting game all together. I love mystery stuff so this game was perfect. would have given 5 star for more if the search and find games.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Through the Trees, St Croix, and now Loma Vista-- GREAT indie music. I have been listening to their latest tune, Hero, on the local LA station, and I'm glad to see their music has made it to Amazon.<br />Loma Vista also includes their other great works, including Stairs and St Croix. Chug Jug (the infamous Advil tune) is another favorite, but on the St Croix album.<br />A great value for only $5!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This was bought when I was dating someone, and he bought it. But he seemed to have liked it when we were together. And he definitely won this in the split, I am not a gamer like this.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|such a good book with so many unexpected turns! read it!! :) i cant even talk about it without giving good plot twists away!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book heped me to understand that sometimes our fate is faulted and we dont get what we wanted. I'm now enjoying the time I spend with the ones I love instead of dreading what's ahead, becasue we don't know if our time is up yet.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I purchase a new one every Christmas and will continue to do so until it no longer airs! My daughter loves this show, but doesn't have time to watch it on the scheduled night so very convenient that we get the entire season.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|the remanent of the best band ever. dave makes modern rock still roaming around. grunge until i die. thanks, peace.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Twenties girl,is a terrific book. I read it in a hardcover, and made certain, I now have an electronic copy, so I can reread  it at any time. Enjoyed this book immensely!<br />  Willow.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hope there is more to come.  I don't know what to do with myself anymore now that I have finished this enticing series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A wonderful book that you can hardly put it down once you've started. Can't wait to read the next one.
B005UBNL0A|4.0|This is not my favorite but it does the job and the price isn't to bad but for a little extra you get something a lot better.
0547564651|5.0|I'm working on a doctoral dissertation on related matters and Tough is killing me because he is beating me to the punch on a number of conclusions. He uses empirical research from top thinkers exceedingly well and makes them accessible to all, and his use of anecdotal evidence to illustrate his points is engaging and helpful. Everyone in education (including parents) should read this book.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I was interested in a small camera case or holster bag because I've been in field situations where I have three DSLR camera bodies (two older but not obsolete) and interchangeable lenses. I've been in nature preserves where my main camera, with a telephoto lens, is suitable for long-distance photography, but if I've got two hawks fighting 10 feet over my head, I'd need a different camera-and-lens ready for a quick draw. Hence the need for an auxiliary bag.<br /><br />The bag came in frustration-free packaging; inside was the bag and inside that, the carrying strap along with two Velcro internal (padded) dividers; that was all. The case itself has three exterior zip-up compartments, enough for a small AC charger, extra batteries and memory chips, but not enough for extra camera lenses.<br /><br />I experimented: the bag would take a Canon Rebel XT DSLR camera with a Tamron 70-300mm telephoto lens - just. It will readily accommodate any camera body with a more standard zoom lens, e.g., a 17-55mm.<br /><br />POSITIVES: The base (a single solid shoe made of tough plastic) and carrying handle look more durable than the Lowepro and Canon carrying cases I've used. The pad on the shoulder strap is a nice ergonomic touch, and the top-open, one-zipper lid means you can indeed draw a camera easily and quickly. The bag will accommodate ONE camera with ONE lens, attached, along with extra memory chips and a battery or two in the side pockets. The internal padding is good and the two Velcro internal divider-pads are adjustable to suit your camera, esp. if you carry it lens-down.<br /><br />CAVEATS: If this is a \\"holster\\" bag, be advised that it has no belt loops or attachments, just a cleat (vertical design) on each side for the strap. The strap's design and pad suggests a shoulder carry, although if you wear the strap diagonally (opposite shoulder) and adjust the strap to a longer loop, it can ride on your hip reasonably well, and has a padded mesh back that will resist slidingabout. The bag exterior has no loops or catches to attach separate lens cases, but then that's not the reason to get this bag.<br /><br />A good auxiliary bag for someone with an extra lens and a SLR/DSLR camera body, esp. if they're in the field and need a second camera ready for a sudden opportunity. It's also a good value for its price, simple, compact and well-made.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|My daughter LOVES this doll. This was a Christmas present, along with many other Monster High products. She loves them and has so much fun with them. I loved the price for this particular doll, and she likes it just as much as the more expensive ones. I especially love that the Monster High doll parts are so durable. Their arms and legs are easily detach and attach back together.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and couldn't put it down willingly. Fully recommend reading it, but make sure you have time.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|A game that gets you thinking and one that isn't always connected to the Internet is always a good game. I keep getting hooked
B009GESJH2|5.0|So many great songs on this CD!  Another great CD!  For all us true dedicated KID ROCK FANS!  A must buy CD and at a great price.  He continues to ROCK ON!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Story line flowed well, at first hard to tell how it comes together, but it did and gives a unique perspective on WWII
B000009ED0|5.0|this first album is his young true HARD CORE ROCK head banging and jumping body slamming rap!  Gotto love the OLD SCHOOL KID on this CD.  Love the Cocky cd and new REBEL SOUL.  He continues to treat his DEDICATED FANS!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The first book I've read for 2013 and I couldn't think of a better book than this to start off my year!! The whole \\"Mormon\\" thing had me a little skeptical since I wasn't sure if it were going to be taken through the gutter, but it didn't and I'm so relieved! :) The book was very well written and the story flowtation was superb!! I'm definitely re-reading it and adding it to my favorites!! Now I have to restock my klinex since I was literally in tuned with the characters!!
0307592731|5.0|I am not a big reader these days but this book had me captured from the start. It is a good light read and an inspirering adventure.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a great app, because it allows you to leave your paper, pen or pencil behind when you are researching some something on the Internet.  Just highlight the portion of the article that you want to save.  Then click Evernote & that passage is saved in Evernote.  You can add a tag to it so that you can better identify it when you come back it.  I also use it to save receipts from Internet purchases when I am using a device that is not connected to a printer.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Still as fresh as the day it was released.....Gotta love it. Beatles will never get old. Their music is TIMELESS....
B008OOYALE|5.0|Can't  seem to stop playing this game. It's simply additive. I highly recommend this game. You need to download this game and try it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I would love to play the piano and now i can sort of.  They grandchildren love it too. Fun for the whole family
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Love the games these folks make. Addictive!!!!<br />Keep up the great work.  Don't get this if you expect to sleep or work ; )
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it! As previous reviews stated it was similar to the 50 Shades series but also has its own story line. Would highly recommend to my friends.
B002VRZEYM|1.0|This film was a disappiontment for one basic reason it was short on detailed facts and long on dramatics. I was constantly waiting for details that would never come. This film tries to persuade the audience with emotion instead of facts and statistics. I appreciate the need for natural food and hope that some day all that want it can get it. However the current methods feed millions/billions that would not be fed otherwise and this film does not address this issue. Sometimes people forget there is 7 billion of us that need to eat every day. This film does not advance the front on educating society....................................Unless someone is completely clueless about where there food comes from and how its made. Then it could offer a kernel of infomation but suggest people look into this serious topic with much more detail outside this film.
B0076DELIG|4.0|But, I am hooked!  What can I say?  Same but different I guess is appropriate for a review that requires so many (?) words to write.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|FINALLY I got to see certain characters get their just dues.  This story took turns I didn't think were possible and my husband would often walk through the room and just start laughing because of the look on my face when I was reading it.  LOL.  My favorite in the series so far...I smiled, I felt renewed, I cried...I ran the gamut of emotions while reading this book.  So brokenhearted that one of my favorites is no longer with us...but over all a wonderful book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|get this game it be fun to play when you don't have anything to do it be fun as poop
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm coming in on this series WAY late...and, honestly, only started reading the books because I can't wait until the HBO series starts in March.  I need to know what happens with the Starks.  LOL.  I love these books.  Of course, there are always more details in the books than there ever are in tv or movies...and I love that.  This story gets inside you and sets up house...you have to know about these characters and what's going to happen with him.  And I love the way the author writes characters that we're supposed to dislike (and sometimes do) but we also respect...and sometimes love.  These books are like crack to me and Clash of Kings did not disappoint.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My 8 yr old grandson loves this toy.  We have bought him a lot of Bruder toys and he has loved them all.  And they hold up through his rough playing.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Kids love it, l love it! Game is addictive, but great fun for all. Just play it when kids are away, only chance you will get!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved this movie!!! . So sad to know that stuff like this actually happened in the south.  Characters were awesome and I just loved &#34;hating&#34; the snobby daughter who put her mother in the retirement home.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|They keep making them and we will keep playing them! Great game and kid friendly, no worries about wrong content
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very touching movie and thoroughly enjoyable.  I loved the characters and all of their interactions as they discuss the issues surrounding retirement and how to cope with limited finances. Love how they emphasize looking on the positive side of living!!! I will definitely recommed this movie to my friends.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|First half of the book was &#34;great Grisham.&#34;  I was eagerly recommending the book to friends.  Second half of the book, seemed contrived and more fantasy than fiction, and I stopped my recommendation.  I will NEVER give up on Grisham, though.  He's just done so much that is so very good!!  I'll buy his next book....whatever it is!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have really loved all the Kate Morton Books - but I think this could be the best one - it's very hard to decide. The stories are so engrossing - I find myself completely absorbed by them. They are slower reads but yet you still feel a sense of excitement and longing to know the truth - the author is a great story teller. I love her imagination and the unexpected twists and turns right up to the very end. Excellent book, excellent story with likable characters, flaws and all. 5 stars for this book. I loved it.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great and fun game but sometimes glitches and will not let you jump or slide. I suggest it but you will definitely nt set any world records with it on the kindle fire.
B006O6F932|3.0|Feel Quality is poor considering the price is not low!!!!!  Feel at the retail price should have been more detailed instead of a page of stickers included to decorate the school.
0670026603|4.0|Book reviews, whether I am writing one of my own or reading one from someone else, have never been about the summation of the plot line or a character lineup. I can get that from the book jacket or New York Times. In a review I want to know how the reader was affected by the story. Was it hilarious, causing you to laugh out loud in the subway? Did it transport you, completely immersing you in another person's life? Did it cause a shift in you, making a change for even the briefest of moments in how you feel or your viewpoint?    This gift of a book pierced my heart so thoroughly I required a recovery time before I could write about it. It took a day and a half for me to fly through the pages and then another day and a half for me to absorb what I read. My high opinion of this book isn't a result of an immersion into the characters or a particularly riveting plot. I loved the characters. I laughed out loud, I certainly cried (copiously), and I was definitely glued to every page of this entire novel but what I found so entrancing was the way it caused me to reflect on my own life and love. I think we have all been told at some point in our lives to make sure the spouse you choose is someone you enjoy talking to and can laugh with because ultimately, that is what you will have of each other. Despite being told that exact thing by some of the wisest people in my life, I haven't ever really considered it beyond head-nodding in amicable agreement. Reading this book instigated serious reflection on that point and then post reflection, I was overwhelmed with gratitude. My house is filled with laughter and lively debate. We talk to each other ceaselessly and enjoy one another's company immensely. But would that be enough? If we lost the ability to wander the streets of San Francisco together, to explore the treasures of D.C. hand in hand, even to work out in the yard side by side, would our witty banter and conversational explorations be enough? Yes (enter overwhelming gratitude). And that is what I LOVE about this book. I love that it prompted in me the realization that of all the things I love about him, I love his brain and spirit the most. That if all else was lost I would still have everything. The books I love the most are those that inspire a shift in me. Jojo Moyes shifted me with Me Before You.  [...]
0375869026|5.0|Once in a blue moon! That is how often a book such as Wonder comes along! Wonder is released in March and I thoroughly recommend EVERYONE to read it.<br /><br />The book's main story features Auggie. A boy born with severe disfigurement. He has been home schooled for the majority of his life but he is starting school and the book is told through the course of the school year.<br /><br />The book is split into different sections giving the reader a chance to see how Auggie's story is through another character's eyes. I love this idea and am really impressed how quickly the pace and feel changes in the story.<br /><br />Towards the end as there is a major development with one of the main characters I really started to get a sinister feeling. Was Auggie's life at danger? I was so scared that after growing to love a character as much as I loved Auggie we were going to loose him. The ending will definitely have you reaching for the tissues but for a sad reason or a happy one you will have to read and find out!<br /><br />As I say above this book is amazing! So touching, full of soul and one that will stay with you for a long time.
1416550550|4.0|Oh...That was lovely! The Forgotten Garden is The Secret Garden for grown ups. I loved it. Kate Morton's female characters are full of life. The women in this tale are so completely developed and colorful, full of personality, emotion, and delicious human nuances. Getting to know each of them is a treat in itself. Even the less lovable characters are so dynamic I couldn't help but be entranced by them.<br /><br />This multi-generational tale completely swept me up in the journey of three generations. Morton transports readers back and forth, switching from one generation to the next, unveiling a mystery over 100 years old. Each chapter reveals a piece of the puzzle through the experience of a different character. At the hands of a less talented writer, this may have been difficult to follow but Morton so skillfully shuttles readers through time that each chapter becomes your new favorite, each character the new best one.<br /><br />I didn't figure out the end before it came but I often don't. Unraveling mysteries isn't a talent of mine. In a novel this well written I am too busy loving it to spend time anticipating the end.<br /><br />I have not yet enjoyed The Distant Hours or The Secret Keeper but am looking forward to both since closing the cover on this delicious read. Thank you, Kate Morton!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love logic puzzles and this one is very entertaining.  Difficult enough to want to keep playing and not so difficult as to be frustrating!  Big enough to provide many hours of fun!!Well done!
B001R4KQDE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised on how well this was remastered. Excellent sound and picture quality.Perfect a five star rating from me.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a book that was hard to put down as it delved into space travel issues within the next 50 years.  I thought the characters fleshed out nicely.  The descriptions of the various things the main character did to stay alive all seemed feasible to me (I am no scientist) well explained.<br /><br />Great job and I look forward to his next novel.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This story put a different twist on finding Mr. Right.  It was cute and refreshing.  A fast and easy read.
B0034G4P80|5.0|The movie was great to me, I had the comic when I was a kid. I think that they did a great job in making this movie.
0451418433|4.0|While reading only one quarter of the book, and feeling the darkness of that time can only be interpreted as the signs of the times, this seems like a great book for side reading by history majors, as well as a walk down Memory Lane for all of those who actually lived through some of these events.  Helps one understand that the great struggle goes on.  I read some every evening, and will not let a day go by without a dose of Ken Follett.  Important books, both &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; and &#34;Winter of the World&#34;.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I use iTunes as well, but Amazon typically has a wider variety of songs and at a much more reasonable price. And I can still play them on all my ipods and my Android phone! Thanks Amazon!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|One some levels I knew I missed this series.  Seeing it again, without commercials, reminds me of the gravity of the office of the President, but also of the necessary trust and support needed to serve on the Team.  The writing is flawless and deep on so many levels.  This seems to ground me, and restore my faith in the political process, with the dose of reality born of the humanity of us all.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|America's Greatest Rock Band produced a winner with this one.  Quite a variety of music style.  Thank you, again, Aerosmith!!!
B004I744AS|2.0|It's just my opinion but I simply like the lay out of the Merriam-Webster better.  Tomato Potato, try them both any way.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I laughed the entire movie. I loved it! It is sure to become a classic that ill be watching for years to come.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Not hard to use and overall very good.  But what you say about a dictionary.  Nice to have the ease of access.
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|Adam could sing his grocery list and I'd love it, but this is really, really good!  Shame it hasn't gotten more airplay but I guess America isn't totally ready to stop judging.
B000001E21|4.0|\\"Retro Active\\" includes touched-up versions of Def Leppard's b-sides and outtakes from their recording sessions between 1984 and 1993.Although many of these songs were found on many of Def Leppard's singles,some parts were re-recorded on the road during the \\"Adrenalize\\" tour.Two unfinished songs from the \\"Hysteria\\" sessions,\\"Desert Song\\" and \\"Fractured Love\\",were completed just for this collection.\\"Two Steps Behind\\",an acoustic ballad,originally recorded in electric form,was given strings and then put on the \\"Last Action Hero\\" soundtrack.\\"Rise Into The Sun\\" is not the Def Leppard EP version,but a slightly different version of the B-side from 1987.The intro is changed from Rick Allen's drum solo,to a piano intro.This one is fine,but I liked the original Allen intro better.Overall,this is a nice collection for diehard Lepp fans,but for the casual fan,I'd recommend just picking up \\"Vault\\" instead,which includes most of their well known hits.
0395389496|5.0|How can you not rate this 5 stars. An all time classic. Bought it for my grown daughter for Christmas so she will have one when she starts her family. Family tradition to read this every year. She was thrilled to get this and said it will always be a special book for her.
B00081912E|5.0|The Mask is an all time comedy classic.This is one of Jim Carrey's funniest movies of all time.The Mask also has some pretty cool action scenes in it too.This is Jim Carrey at his finest.I highly recommend this movie. SEE YA!

B000P0J09C|5.0|One of the best war films of all time.The movie is basically set up with two parts,first..the marines getting trained,then them going off to vietnam.The acting,the action,the story is all amazing.If you love war movies,than I highly recommend this one.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This film is so awful one hardly knows where to start.<br /><br />The central premise - that criminal gangs from the future send their gangland enemies 30 years back in time to be executed by time-traveling assassins - is just beyond stupid. Huh?  Well, apparently, in the future, it's impossible to dispose of murdered bodies, so it's easier to send your live victims back in time to be killed, after you tie them up, put hoods over their heads and wrap them in bars of silver in order to pay the time-traveling assassins.  Uh...yeah, that makes sense.<br /><br />Then add to that a Terminator rip-off subplot where one of the assassins goes back in time to kill a child who has killed his wife 30 years in the future.<br /><br />The screenplay is so bad and the directing so inept that the actors seem to just wander around in a stupor, asking, \\"What am I supposed to be doing here?\\"<br /><br />The cinematography is murky.  The pacing is lethargic.  The editing is beyond incompetent.  Every single character, including the little kids, are so one-dimensional and irritating that I couldn't wait for them to kill each other, but they couldn't even manage to do that.<br /><br />It's lousy science fiction.  It's lousy action.  It's lousy film noir.<br /><br />And perhaps worst of all, Bruce Willis, who I've followed ever since he was the bartender at my local restaurant in Hell's Kitchen, has totally jumped the shark, joining Robert DeNiro among actors whose future films I will avoid.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Wow!  She went over the deep end between children's books and adult fiction.  We read this in our book club because of curiosity and all 12 of us hated it.  The characters were pathetic, the story had no purposeful ending and we didn't have much to discuss at our meeting.  Hope she does a better job next time.  I loved and reread the Harry Potter Series.
B00942S4OY|5.0|so my daughter tells me. we've played this CD over and over since Christmas day. Most of the songs are really good!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. There was so many twists and turns and the love story was so relatable. The characters are very well developed and really come alive. I felt like I was right there with them. I recommended this book to all my girlfriends
146500632X|5.0|My 13 year old daughter went ga ga when she opened this christmas present. It's up on her wall and i'm sure will give visual pleasure for months to come!
0345803485|3.0|If you are out for a literary masterpiece, then you should probably pass on this one.  A quick read with little depth, go for it.
6305428352|5.0|I love this movie! So sad but true - the arts are the first thing cut from schools. Ironically, the students enrolled in fine arts classes are far brighter than those on the football field!
1423101464|5.0|Although this book is aimed at the young adult market I found it to be a wonderful read. My daughter recommended this series to me and having just finished this one, book four in the series, I have to say she was right. This is great stuff. The author took Greek mythology and created a cast of characters that is always interesting, funny and surprising. I loved the previous three books as well, but I think this one was my favorite. Lots of action, great character building and deft weaving of mythology into modern times makes this book and the whole Percy Jackson and the Olympians series great reading for both kids and adults.
B00447G29S|3.0|The movie was good and I'm sure I'll watch it again next Christmas.  Visually, the characters look a little creepy.  Don't really like the way it looks, but after I got used to it, I looked past it and enjoyed the story.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Best ever love it. I sit there and wont stop playing. I love the armor and spells and the monsters that kick butt u like skyrim play this.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Two adults put this together in about 6 hours.  Really enjoyed the details.  Would recommend to collectors or car buffs.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|It was very well written with twist endings. If you liked Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games, you will love these series.
B001J29H9I|5.0|As much as I like their new stuff too their early sounds are my favorite and this album is loaded with it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought it was good and I liked it like as always do with wimpy kid books but I thought it was unrealistic in many ways.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait to continue this series. You can get involved in everyone's life and care. I like how their portrayal is close to reality.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Not as good as the BBC series, &#34;Sherlock&#34; but quite entertaining. I am surprised that I like the Watson character as played by Lucy Liu as much as I do. I always like Jonny Lee Miller in most everything he plays. I am not quite convinced by him here but he is doing a reasonable job so far. I predict it will have a second season. But, ranking the Holmes characters in media in the last 50 years or so, I still put Jeremy Brett first in the old BBC series, followed by Benedict Cumberbatch in &#34;Sherlock.&#34; Yet, in my mind, no one will ever come close to Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes in the old movies. He is the quintessential Holmes that comes to mind when I read the original Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. So, would I recommend the series - yes, with a caveat that you must check out &#34;Sherlock&#34; on Hulu Plus or Netflix or Amazon Prime.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Good intro to Dr. Who for anyone who missed the classic episodes.  Christopher Eccleston is fun as the Dr. and a great warmup for David Tennant the following seasons.
1594487154|5.0|As someone who loved A Whole New Mind, I was excited to receive an advanced review copy of To Sell is Human. Just like A Whole New Mind blew my mind and helped me to embrace my right-brain gifts, To Sell is Human has helped me to look at sales in a whole new, empowered way (thank goodness, considering the traditional way of thinking of sales makes me cringe!).<br /><br />Dan has an incredible talent for distilling research and data down to core concepts and actionable steps. Plus he throws in some good humor and well-told stories to illustrate his points, too. His easy-to-follow framework for \\"moving others\\" includes the 3 qualities of Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity (How to Be) and the 3 skills Pitch, Improvise, and Serve (What to Do). Each chapter ends with A Sample Case including resources and tips to help you implement the ideas right away (something that I find really helpful).<br /><br />Being the right-brainer that I am, I was pleasantly surprised to see some \\"softer skills\\" like listening, mirroring, asking questions, and even doing improv show up in a book about sales. Just like with a Whole New Mind, it was nice to these more right-brain aspects being valued in the business world.<br /><br />A few of my favorite take-aways (there were many more) included learning about ways to problem-find rather than problem-solve to help frame offers in a more compelling way. And his section on Buoyancy gave me some valuable perspective on how to deal with the rejection that inevitably comes with putting yourself out there.<br /><br />As a creative entrepreneur, I think To Sell is Human is a fantastic and accessible resource to help you feel more comfortable selling yourself, especially when you reframe it to being of service - \\"make it personal and make it purposeful.\\" I've already shared some of the ideas from the book with my clients and community and they've been excited about it.<br /><br />As someone who spent a decade in corporate America, I also can see how concepts like the 6 different ways to effectively pitch (from the Twitter Pitch to the Pixar Pitch) could help leaders and managers gain organizational buy-in on internal initiatives.<br /><br />Whether you're officially in sales or not, in this day and age it's vital to effectively influence and persuade others. That's why I would recommend To Sell is Human to anyone looking to make a difference and move others. Order a copy for yourself and let it inspire you to make the world a better place with what you have to offer.<br /><br />(Disclosure: I'm part of the volunteer book launch team and received an advanced copy of the book from the publisher. The comments and opinions expressed in this review are my own and have not been edited or approved by anyone. I liked the book so much I bought my own copy.)epts like the 6 different ways to effectively pitch (from the Twitter Pitch to the Pixar Pitch) could help leaders and managers gain organizational buy-in on internal initiatives.<br /><br />Whether you're officially in sales or not, in this day and age it's vital to effectively influence and persuade others.

B000GWE44U|5.0|Alert!<br /><br /> Just put a pad down on your seat before you sit on your chair while watching this movie, it is going to make you poop and scares the begeez out of you!
B0095R76EW|4.0|One of the big reasons I found this movie funny was because of the concept of having a significant other move to a whole new part of the country to be with you.  That person learning a new culture and geography with the motivation being the status of the relationship vs something they personally want is a huge part of this movie and something I definitely related to.<br /><br />Overall the movie was entertaining and a couple of laugh out loud moments.  But watching it once was enough...
B008VBYN80|5.0|It's my favorite type of game and you can do battle in it who wouldn't love this game I ask you
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Watch these back to back. They will not disappoint. A beautifully done costume drama as a TV series, focused on the young women of a changing world.
B008XG1X18|5.0|very good app love to browse and get ideas for my crafts! has lots of good pictures love that I can save what I like for future reference
B005LAJ16I|5.0|You will watch this series on the edge of your seat, as the plot unfolds. I was grateful to get the whole season so I didn't have to wait a week to see what happens next. This is a very well-crafted drama and Claire Danes proves that she is an amazing actress. If you're bored or have a weekend alone to kill, this is the perfect amusement. Gripping.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas since he is a big Rush fan and as usual it didn't disappoint!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love everything about it, the quick movement, the detail, all of it. The help and assistance makes playing the game addictive.
B00013RC8O|5.0|have not seen this movie in a long time. wanted to add to my movie collection. price was right. also love the car.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|The concept was good, but I found on my Fire that the controls were too touchy.  After working on it for quite a while, I finally decided to delete it. At least, it was a FAOTD.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This is such a funny and clever movie and I love that it was only five dollars.  Worth every penny!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great Series! Season two is awesome as well, and I have no idea what the critics were complaining about with the second season. Do yourself a favor and watch this program. It is AWESOME!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I love the new Dr. Suess movies.  The message and images are so  beautiful.  I would definately recommend this to others.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|1. Terrible writing, I hate it how she constantly repeats herself through the novel (i.e. don't bite your lip)<br />2. It's the typical cliche of good girl meets bad boy fall in love and suddenly she was able to tame him and mend his bad ways. Worse though no energy, no substance is represented in the book<br />3. I'm the type that has to like the characters in order to continue reading the book but I felt like I couldn't identify with any of them.<br /><br />Warning don't buy the book it's a waste of money.
B00005JPCF|4.0|The graphics on this look amazing on my new tv!  Howerver, sometimes I get a little irritated with all the current music in kids films and when they make the characters overly hip.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book is full of all twists and turns....I LOVED IT!!!!<br /><br />It's one of those books where it just sticks with you long after you read it. The characters of the novel are flawed but you love them in spite that.<br /><br />I was slightly disappointed with the ending though
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I bought this movie for myself and hubby.  Love horse stories of anykind and this proved to be a good one.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I have been hypnotized by Annie's voice for over 30 years !!!<br />Everything she does is spectacular !<br />She is a true beauty.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The World of Goo is a fun game when you have free time. With different levels the game World of Goo exceeds all needs to entertain yourself. What's even better is the fact that the app is free! I would highly recommend that you get this app. It's worth your time! What's not to love? Plus, if you really don't like it that much you can always delete it later, but at least give it a try. This fun addicting goo building bridge/tower game is sure to hook you. Though,my description of the World of Goo does sound strange, I assure you, you will love this app!
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|He's amazing. I love this album. Ed Sheeran reminds me of a young John Mayer meets Joshua Radin kinda stuff. But he's great to make a name for himself. You wont be disappointed with this cd.
B00932HEX2|5.0|Watched the entire first season. Unfortunately work and life got in the way of watching it straight through, which meant that it plagued my thoughts inbetween viewings. This is a heart grabbing show and worth the time. My husband stayed awake through the whole thing.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Great album. These guys are just amazing. It's a must have record from 2012. They really don't disappoint, I loved the first album, and certainly love this one.<br />I haven't skipped a track yet.<br />Great buy!
0783229321|5.0|Such a classic movie, I had to get it. It arrived quickly and the packaging was alright. DVD works great.
B009738XXM|2.0|I bought the cd it was on special and decided to give her a try. Definitely stick to Call me Maybe.<br />Maybe she'll surprise afterwards. But not with this album.
8862931921|5.0|Moleskine is one of those companies you just have to know. This notebook stands in par with the rest of the Moleskine lineup. Sturdy, well built, and, most importantly, incredibly functional. The notebook, like all good tools, does not detract in any way from what you use it for; simple and conservative. The cover and pages are just the right textures and colors. It is well worth it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very good you should definitely read it!! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My boy loves Angry Birds, now my daughter likes it too. My wife used to hate it and now...she's playing it.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|yes, its a darker version of snow white, but the acting and effects of this movie are great. you get a good look not only on snow white, but also of the evil queen, which you wouldn't normally see in Snow White. this movie is a good one
B009MF56GC|4.0|If you want a good story and top notch acting then this isn't for you. If you want to see a lot of guns, knifes, bombs and such then look no further. It is entertaining from beginning to end with only a short slow point in the middle. It is like watching the classic action movies from decades ago when these guys looked in their prime. They may not look it anymore, but they deliver the movie that they used to.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Best Christmas CD ever, love his voice. yes, would recommend his CD.  As of 2012 it will be my all time favorite.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|everything I expected<br />I had previously worn out the cassette years ago and now the cd brings the enjoyment back
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter loves it!!! Very cute easy to put away.  Could be more durable, but super cute style compensates, for duribility.  Its a good toy, seems safe and easy for my eight year old.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Fin & Easy to maneuver ,  seems great for kids, but I use it myself , I never have to be bored again :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great love story with lots of adventure and emotion. Full of passion for life and for love!! Can't wait to read the second book!!
B0065GC0BA|3.0|The storyline was new and refreshing although a litttle far fetched. Whilst a bit predictable it did retain my interest.
B001NLL93W|5.0|AMAZING!!!!! <3 I would never thought I'd be this in love with a book I just can't stop reading it. It's like book crack to me
6302921228|5.0|I was so excited to find this on Amazon at a great price. I bought it used but it came in AMAZING condition. The tape itself has 2 episodes on it. I'm so happy to relive my childhood adventures with Ariel! Great addition to any Princess collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was amazing I loved it could not put it down until I finished it must read more, must read catching fire and mockingjay to be totally happy
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I'm a huge Disney buff. I am 24 and have no children of my own but I collect anything &#34;Disney Princess&#34; and so of course I was very excited to hear we were getting a new princess. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Princess not like any others! Merida is a great Princess role model for young girls. She is brave and strong and shows that you don't have to follow the road that is laid out before you.
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|Pretty good too short though troll troll troll troll troll I am only doing this so I have enough words thank you,<br /><br />Troll
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I have all the other soundtracks from the Twilight movies and have enjoyed them all. I like this one better than the one from Breaking Dawn Part 1, but still like the original Twilight soundtrack best with New Moon a close second. I like all the songs, except i really dont like the one that Greenday does, and i generally like their music.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I am happy that the second book was as great as the first. I can not wait for the third book to come to me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I THOUGHT BOOK 2 WAS BETTER THAN BOOK ONE, BUT THE WHOLE SERIES IS JUST GREAT. I HAVE RE READ THIS BOOK TWO TIMES, YES IT WAS THAT GOOD.
B00846REIS|5.0|Full of detail. Lots of emotion. In my eyes better than fifty shades of grey. Can't wait to read second book.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Good game. It gets a little repetitive after awhile. The graphics are nice. I got this game for free and so I can not complain, but I do feel that it is worth buying. I encountered a problem early on where when I went back to the game, I had to start over rather than pick up where I left off. This only happened once.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Another enjoyable Dan Brown thriller. Great action. Great plot twist. Great writing. A must read if you liked Angels & Demons or Davinci Code.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Loved it! I couldn't put it down. Holder has all the right words and I loved Sky. Not once did I want to scream at these characters. Usually lead characters make me want to scream at them but not here.<br /><br />I'm really loving Colleen Hoover as an author.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Saw Bruno finishing up a live performance on TV, maybe SNL. It was catching so here I am downloading and enjoying. It has a catchy beat, fun song. I love his voice.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|It was a typical Older Young Adult read hence the 3 stars but I really enjoyed the characters. I really enjoyed the fact that the main male character, Travis wasn't afraid to express his feelings for Abby. He's your typical bad boy that you can't help but love. I didn't care for some of the violent tendencies that he had, thank goodness for this being a fictional world. And of course with the girl, there were a few times that I wish she'd spoken some of her feelings but I liked that she held her ground where it really counted.<br /><br />This is another great read for romance addicts like me.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|We all know k.d. has a great voice. This is a great showcase of it with a good selection of songs. Very Enjoyable!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|App is User friendly. Love that is shows everything you've entered. I needed something fast and easy.<br />Would highly recommend
B0099116AY|3.0|I was a little disappointed, I love Meryl but felt there could have been more closure at the end of the movie. I feel that it just ended.
B00117W1HQ|4.0|Love this show. Its a bit cheesy but not in a bad way. You find yourself actually invested in Sam and Dean.  You will enjoy!
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Love reading Michael Connelly books. Enjoy his writing style and the characters. I read one of his books a few years ago and started looking for them ever since.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|I kinda tend to judge a movie by how long I can remember the plot. (I watch a LOT of Movies) I watched this movie a couple weeks ago. Can,t remember much about it. Bruce Willis was in it for about a minute. lol
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Awesome! With classic songs and Rod's raspy voice this is romantic and fun, yet sentimental. It provides a slightly different version of the classic songs that I have cherished throughout my life!
0307245306|5.0|As I said for book 1, I got this for my son. He loved them both, and if you like to listen to a book on long drives, you can't go wrong with CD books!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|A good adventure with our double secret agents.  Tommy Lee Jones got a cameo, as did Emma Thompson.  Both were great, and Josh Brolin pulled off the younger version of Tommy Lee.  (Sorry, I get their names mixed up, Agent K, Agent J, and Agent O.)  Story was a lot different than the previous two films, but played with time travel and other things which would be spoilers here.  Worth the price to have a DVD at home.  Be sure you get the right version when you order, plain DVD or BluRay, or whatever else.  Remember, if it's too cheap, you may be getting something you don't want.  Happy viewing.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books and the movie just brought it all to life. I enjoy everything about this product, it's another great family movie night.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Movies don't get better than this! It was so good that after watching it both my husband and I agreed this one we needed to purchase for our movie collection! You will not be sorry you decided to see this one!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I love the movie and I love how quick I received it. It's a great movie for family movie nights.
B000007VLL|5.0|I love Bonnie Tyler this cd is great it's got all great songs and music is easy to dance too as well i'd recommend this to anyone that loves the 80s and Bonnie Tyler.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This was a birthday present for my little cousins, they hadn't seen it yet, so they were super excited to open this and loved it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have used Evernote for a couple of years on my other devices. This is easy and syncs with my account.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Great movie if you enjoy action and it's definitely a twist on the normal Snow White fairy tale we are used to.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Seasons 1-5 were absolutely amazing! Seasons's 6 & 7 were NOT up to par. So far, Season 8 is better than the previous two. YAY!
B003SI7OQ4|5.0|An adventurous cartoon with adventuresome characters,  ideal for kids but with enough wit and goofy maturity for parents to enjoy as well.  Such a combination is a too-infrequent find.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|The carrying case is compact for traveling.  It would be nice if the USB charger could fit in it with the headset, then it would be perfect.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|This is enjoyable, don't get me wrong-- Meryl and Tommy Lee as a married couple; what could be more delicious.  Too bad the writing and direction are average at best.  And Steve Carell, imho, adds very little-- his isn't really a comic role, and he basically plays his usual Steve Carell persona fairly straight-- what's the point of that?  By the same token, what's the point of this movie-- it could have been something.  What it is is the kind of movie that enjoyably kills a couple hours, on an airplane or on an idle saturday afternoon.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I was curious to see if Harry Potter's creator could transition to adult fiction... And she just about did. The book was, in fact, strangely compelling, even though I didn't love it. Sme of the descriptive passages seemed to belong more in the Harry Potter genre than in the world of adult lit, but overall the story was good and the characters well developed. I will be curious to see what she comes up with next.
B00005B36H|4.0|this cd was purchased as part of a gift for my sister as a Christmas present (she likes this band)
B009JBZH54|5.0|The movie came super early. The best gift to receive in the morning of the day of release. I did not mind going to my door, while the mailman knocked, and have this epic trilogy in my hands already. Thank you very much
B009JBZH54|5.0|Is's a bluray value pack! It is exactly as advertised and I even bought another one for a gift.  The bonus dvds and books are cool but I bought this for the movies and they are perfect.  It's a great deal.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I only have one gripe.. that you do not automatically return to list of players to play. Other than that this game is really great!
0525478817|5.0|What a wonderful story about such a sad and poignant situation. I had been thinking of reading this book for a few weeks after reading one of John Green's other books and enjoying it. I cried - and I defy anyone reading this book not to finish it without a tear and a sigh. The characters, and I mean all of them (even van houten), were written smartly with the fine detail necessary to impart the soulfulness of the experience they were living with. I recommend this book to everyone no matter your age or gender and I believe you will walk away the better for the reading .....okay? Okay!
B009O2XY12|5.0|Great for those who are just starting out! Really goood for theyounger kids that are needing to learn hand eye cordination
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is not only fun but is  good for teaching to figure out how to use tools for different situations.good for every one.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|love this game.. But to small and busy tiles for my liking.. would prefer less dificult markings on each tile.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|the only thing it seems to end at a seemly odd polnt?? but all and all I really did enjoy it ..
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Movie is funny but not as funny as I thought it would be.  If you like Family Guy then you will like this.
B0034KHFM4|5.0|Monster Gaga! She's as creative and inviting as David Bowie used to be! Her work will endure for sure ( :
0142405809|5.0|The writing and illustrations in this book are adorable.  My 3.5 year old son just loves this one.  Highly recommended.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|I love these guys! They always have an exciting way of writing and performing ( : I always be a fan!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|This device has so many uses whether it comes to mixing audio for a presentation, a gaming video, or playing musical instruments. There are so many controls and this mixer has just enough inputs/outputs/controls for just about anything that I've been using it for. It seems to be very durable as well. It does seem to get hot after a while, but that hasn't affected it's use at all and so far hasn't damaged the device in any way. Behringer is the way to go!
B0011Z33ES|5.0|This guy has taken my music interests to another level ( : He never fails to impress me with his voice and writing as well as his international interpretation ( :
B0086700CM|5.0|I like this game, very fun, very addictive.  The fact that the game is free makes it better yet.  Glad I took a chance.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was bomb, although it was a tad slow. The latter half of the book really gets going and I didn't want to stop reader. I definitely recommend this book, just stick with it.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is THE best album out there known to mankind, in my opinion.  I have played it so much over the years it has worn down.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it for ANY music fan.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Wow--I loved this album since hearing it on WZLX FM here in Boston. They love LZ and have slowly worked their way through the album.<br /><br />Great running order. Great mix...heavy on the drums!!<br /><br />Even if you have every other LZ release, get this one for new take on classics. Play these cds loud!<br /><br />A friend was there in London in 2007 and said the show was great. She was right!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Like the title says.  I must admit that I love animations, manga, and video games.<br />With that out of the way, after I watched a trailer for this, I didnt think I would like this film at all.<br /><br />but thank god I did.  Thanks to lightning deal of the day, I got this for $8.96 to complete my pixar collection.<br /><br />To keep it short, story was beautiful.  characters were adorable.  I immediately thought about renting this to my friends who have daughters. :)  I really liked it.<br />Graphic was off course gorgeous as other pixar movies are, voice acting was wonderful.  And liked few of the bonus materials too.<br /><br />This is a must buy for any movie fans, young and old.  Fan of pixar or not.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It's as good as the first book. It keeps you wanting more and it never disappoints. I love how there is never a slow spot where you want to skip over. It's a good read for all ages.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great twists and turns. Great read!<br />The ending was totally unexpected, but I liked it.....it fit the characters quite well. I'm a Flynn fan!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The first three films have long held a solid place in my video collection.  But the video quality (particularly Raiders 1) was starting to seem pretty dark by todays standards.  So it was virtually a no brainer when the Blu Ray collection came out.  I hesitate only, because the original price was something like $69 for the 5-disc set.  Well lets face it, given how weak the 4th installment was, and the fact that all the extra features are the same as before (and have not gotten any improved video) its really only the 3-disc set I was shopping for.  So when the price came down to $39, THEN it was a no brainer.  I'm happy that episode 1 looks so much better.  Wish they could get it looking as good as episodes 2 & 3 which look brilliant.  But they are all stunning compared to the originals.  Oh, and just for grins, I did watch the Cystal Skull to see if it was as weak as I'd remembered.  And while there are some enjoyable sequences, the inevitable sentimental ending is so sacharine sweet (and hardly credible), you're just glad its over fast. And glad that I didn't pay more than $39 for the set.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Because it's all about the money. We have other options wind and solar that are safe but then the oil companies wouldn't be able to sell it to us for a high price.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Music n movie are amazing soundtrack makes me relieve the movie all over again its a must if you are a fan of musicals
B005LAII1C|1.0|This movie TED is more of a PORNO film. Also,this movie is DEFINITELY NO recommended for ANYONE,especially children under age of 21!
0525952926|4.0|As with the previous review, I really like all his books.  Since Pillars of the Earth, I have been a big fan.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a really good book, very interesting, and I would probably recommend it to anyone and everyone I suppose.
030758836X|4.0|Have not read yet, but from all the reviews I received from friends, I am sure I will enjoy it.
030758836X|5.0|This book was crazy messed up! I read the whole thing in two days because it just kept getting stranger and stranger. I love when a good book makes you want to keep turning the pages- this book definitely does that!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an awesome book!!! I loved it I can't wait to get started on reading the 2nd book!! Whoo!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|It was very unique. I had the worst time trying to understand why Abe Lincoln had to be the main character but they tie it all up well in the end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety of games. the level of difficultly is great for all ages. the fact that I always get points for.playing.is even better.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Not only did I really enjoy reading this book but I put it to work in my life and it has worked for me splendidly!<br />If you are interested in how the mind can work, especially your memory, then you will want to read this.  Not only is it extremely informative and will give you plenty to work with in developing your own ability to memorize important things, but it was a fun book to read given the character of the people the author met and worked with, not to mention the life he actually lived for a year or so.  One word: Fascinating!
B00002ZMNV|5.0|in the first CD i like only &#34;the memory remains&#34;<br /><br />second CD is the THE DEAL for me. Nothing else matters, just melts my heart and takes me somewhere :). the guitar in outlaw torn is just... well i cant describe it..! LISTEN to it......<br /><br />i can go on .. but u get the point...! :)<br /><br />this Metal-Orchestra combo is pure heaven!
B00886XQO0|5.0|THESE HEADPHONES ROCK!!! everything sounds great.. never had an issue with set up.<br />I am an audiophile and trust me if they sounded even the slightest bit bad I would say it, but they don't..<br />If you have been on the fence about getting these... then just do it.. well worth the money.
1881273156|5.0|everyone should read this book, religious or not.  it is very true and will help you understand how to express love to your mate.
076781326X|5.0|It has a universal appeal in the human search for love and acceptance.<br />No wonder it won six Academy Awards in all categoties.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This one took the perfect amount of time for a  game like this. Graphics were good and I always like the look of hand drawn scenes. Plenty of areas to explore and makes sense as you go along. Good afternoon killer!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I bought this DVD for my Granddaughter as she loved to watch it at my house and always wanted to take it home with her.  Figured it would just be easier if she had a copy for at her house too!  It arrived within the alloted time frame and was well packaged and well received by my very excited Granddaughter.  Another good buy from Amazon.  Ellen P.
B00A12VJZM|4.0|You offer the whole album and one item was not available anymore. ????? How was that? I am Rolling Stone fan and I though this would be a different performance. The sound is the same that the audio that we already know in the well known songs.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was a great book, I strongly suggest that you should read it. I stayed up very late into the night for about a week to finish it. Great book, defiantly worldly the money!
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I was really disappointed with this book. I read the reviews but I must have missed something. The only part I liked was the chapter about her and Sarah Palin. Other than that I thought it was boring.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Hubby and I watched it together during the holidays and it was very entertaining. Will be watching the Christmas special one very soon.
B000OWAFPE|4.0|My family really enjoys this movie.  It has parts that are drawn out and the kids always loose interest at that point.
B008JAGZDE|3.0|Same ole',same Ole&#34; with this movie.  No new surprises, it is exactly what you would expect from American series of movies.  Didn't like it at all.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent characters and story!!!! Couldn't stop reading! Id recommend this book 100 times over to anyone and everyone! Well done.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|We totally enjoyed this movie.  The Grandchildren also liked watching it with us.  Costumes were  beautiful.  I don't have anything else to say but need more words for this review.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|one of the best movies I have seen in a long time thank you I will let all my friends know  thanks
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Excellent movie for men or women.  Beautiful scenes and interesting assesment of early pioneers (1940) in Eastern US.  I would highly recommend this to everyone.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I never got a chance to watch this movie. It was the first time I have ever had trouble instant streaming through amazon. It would take forever to load a section, play for a minute and then start the loading process again. By the time I got back to it, the rental had expired. I am very disappointed and I can't see to find where to report something like that to amazon.com.
B00943SQCI|4.0|We totally enjoyed this movie.  The Grandchildren also liked watching it with us.  Costumes were  beautiful.  I don't have anything else to say but need more words for this review.
B001EN71HC|5.0|I grew up with these movies throughout Middle School/High School -- yet strangely, haven't watched them in years. It was so refreshing revisiting these movies! The dialogue was still etched into my memory...&#34;From the moment I heard Frow, say I had a clone, I knew that I'd be safe cause' I'd never be alone...Just the Two of Us...&#34; Classic.  The Bluray quality looks amazing!<br /><br />Buy the set if you can.  Such a great price!<br /><br />-Dave
B0090EIILU|2.0|We liked his other movies but this one was a real drag.  I would not recomment this to anyone anywhere.
034580404X|5.0|I just simply could not put the book down unless I had to work. It grabbed my attention from the minute that I started reading it. Truly loved reading this book!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Men in Black III is the best movie out of the trilogy excellent performance by both Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones! Loved it!
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Un expectedly wonderfully crafted movie! Loved it! This sure was an unexpected and pleasant surprise! As the movie unfolds, the viewer isn't really sure where this is headed! hang on till the end, you won't be disappointed!
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I love Nikita, I think by far it is a great show and I can't wait to purchase the second season of Nikita. It has a lot of action and very good actors as well. I would definitely require this show to anyone who likes good action.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Loved all previous movies ... loved this too! If you have watched and own the others, this is a must!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought the original Perplexus for my 6 year old nephew last year and their whole family loved it....even my brother-in-law!  I bought this one for my nephew's 7th birthday and I am sure he will love this one as well.  Very fast shipping!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this one and the lamb for my twins and I love them. Their easy to find when dropped in the car seat and great when their swaddled at night. They are also good when they are on the swing. If they fall out when they are sleeping they don't go far and you can always find them.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There is nothing i can say except i LOVE star wars,mad fan even the star war comic series the clones cant seem to get enuogh of those.Have watched this compulation 5/6 times.The only small issue i have is the 4,5,6 disc are not as good a quality even in blu-ray which is a crying shame,but still would recommend this to anyone.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Very easy to use but I can't figure out how to logout in order for my wife to logon to her Facebook account
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game with hours of game play. There is definitely something here for every one. I would definitely recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app is great in that it's easy to use and I love the way you can select different translations mid-passage.  I like the devotional plans too, but the daily reminder notifications aren't working for me.
0345803485|1.0|This is the worst book I've ever read. The sex scenes (once you finally get to them) are SO boring, I have absolutely no idea why they're even calling this porn. You want porn? WATCH PORN. Watch Skinemax, even that's hotter than this crap! I wrote more exciting sex scenes when I was in 7th grade, and you know why? Because I didn't call it \\"down there\\". The number of times Ana said \\"Oh my\\" throughout the story, I was wondering when the lions and tigers and bears were going to show up. Ana, by the way, is the most uninteresting, idiotic protagonist with whom I've ever had the misfortune to journey through a story. She is falsely self-deprecating (because we all know she actually loves herself, which is why she's able to judge every single other female in the story, including her best friend Kate, with such disdain). She seems to hate everyone except Christian, and yet still has this \\"woe is me, I'm so plain\\" characteristic that is so annoying I cannot tell you how many times I wanted to reach into the book and punch her teeth out. And Christian...Christian is not sexy. The description of his looks might sound sexy (although, his pants that hang in \\"that way off his hips\\"...how else do pants hang?? Is Ana surprised that he doesn't wear suspenders?), but if any man told me to do the things that he makes Ana do (and I'm NOT talking about the BDSM, which is a whole other issue I'm not even going to begin to get into) and asserted that much control over every facet of my life, and played these ridiculous mind games with me (the guy is moodier than a pregnant woman), and tracked my cell phone after meeting me once? Buh-bye. I don't care how \\"sexy\\" you are, you are creepy as hell. There are so many problems with this book I can't even begin to discuss - hello, the GRAMMAR!! The writing in general. The repetitiveness. The complete lack of creativity (which fuels the repetition I imagine. I mean, why write a 200 page book when you can write a 400 page book by repeating the same scenes 3 times!!). Oh, the total and utter lack of an actual plot. The clumsy and completely unnatural-sounding dialogue. The constant Britishisms. E.L. James has absolutely no idea how a 22 year old American girl talks, or acts. Who graduates college nowadays without a computer or an EMAIL ADDRESS? That's just not possible anymore, I'm pretty sure colleges give you an email address. Mine did, and I graduated a whopping 6 years ago. I just...I can't. This book makes me so mad. The success of this book makes me even more mad, not to mention E.L. James's smug attitude about her work - which she very clearly plagiarized from Twilight. I'm sorry, E.L., you don't get to be smug about something that DIDN'T COME FROM YOUR OWN BRAIN. And the fact that they're going to turn this garbage into a movie? I really have no words.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I admit I bought the book because I liked the title, but what an unexpected pleasure it was to read!..The author is articulate and humorous.  The story reminds me of how the Forrest Gump character gets (coincidently) caught up in historical events.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|It is a good simulation.  The graphics are smooth and displays are great.  It gets old fast flying around though.  I wish it had more interactivity.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This is probably my favorite Christmas movie. It is altogether funny and moving. A true Christmas classic for all to see
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The acting is great and visuals are stunning.  The only problem is the bad guy has a mask that muffles his speech to the point it is difficult to understand what he is saying (subtitles would be nice to turn on then).  I have seen it twice and still get into the movie (rare for me).  If you like Batman you will love this movie.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This is a Sci-Fi action movie that was entertaining. Some of the scenes seem long in the directors cut. That's why it's a directors cut though.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really enjoy this game..... addicting! Could not stop playing it once I started! So much fun! Love all the mystery games.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am addicted to this game. I have it on both on my phone and my Kindle and I. can't stop playing!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Don't like this at all.  Could not get into it like I thought I was.  Deleted it from my games
B008MEM24S|5.0|Getting this game is totally worth paying $0.99 for to play all day long.  If you love perry get this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun and challenging games. good way to pass the time. interesting puzzles to complete in timed settings. several types of games different puzzles.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|My Son Has most of the Nerf Gun's and this one is one of the biggest and holds the most Nerf Dart. I bought the extra clips so now it holds I think 40 darts in one shot! AWESOME!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like is so far but I know eventually I will have to buy the whole game. I like the g5 games but I find it hard to pay $3 for a game that just ends and probably wouldn't be fun to play again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app!! It even reads to you if you want it to. If you are looking for a bible app, this is a good choice!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game is really fun!! The only complaint is going back to do better on some screens you can't jump around. Otherwise it is fun and helps you use your brain to analyze the puzzle to figure it out!
B00A2H9LK6|3.0|The SGI for quite a bit of it was very impressive, but after a while, the walls having dandruff and melting away to another world became a little repetitive.  There's a good shirtless bit with a girl lying on a table (she meets a not so great end) and easily the climax of the film for me is when Kit Harington was shirtless; it all kind of went downhill for me after he put his shirt down.  The romance was very forced (I seriously had no idea what they were trying to do there, it was really lame; maybe deleted scenes will make it make more sense? Because it was no good) and none of them had very convincing American accents.  All in all, the shirtless parts and the SGI are the only reasons to watch this movie, though both make it a little worth all of the crappiness of the rest of the film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing!! I might even say that it's better than the first one!! Can't wait to read book 3!! HOPE the movie does it justice!! :))
B001NN4162|4.0|gave this as a gift.  arrived just fine and timely<br />i do not have the time to give detailed reviews of every purchase.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I found this book to be very entertaining. I thought the ending was very cool. It leaves you asking yourself: as humans we put ourselves up on such a high level, but when it really comes down to it are we really any different than a wild animal?
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I was thrilled I was able to see this on Amazon. This movie is great for children as well as adults. Heart-warming, suspenceful, and endearing. I cried. I highly recommend this movie for all to see.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I was blown away by the transfer of this movie to 3D Blu-ray.  I watched it on a Samsung ES8000 3D LED TV and could not have been more impressed.  The story is OK, but the 3D visuals are reference quality.  Great sense of depth and a feeling of immersion into the film.<br /><br />When you want to show off what 3D TV can do - use this disc.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I ordered this for my husband and I was very pleased at how quickly it came.  The case was flawless, never opened, and the DVD was high quality.  I thought it was a good price for the two movies as well.
0674048849|5.0|This is a beautiful edition and the annotations very interesting...adds new insights to the story, helping to understand the historical context.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Incredible voices! Great Songs! This movie is full of talent and full of laughs. A feel good sing along  a'Capella good time!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A real spell binder.  Very real emotions and human reactions.<br />Could never have guessed the ending. Great read.  Landay's<br />previous novels are now on my reading list.
030758836X|4.0|I like the two voices.  A wild ride.  Hard to put the book down.  Would love to see the couple a year after.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent space survival story and a lot of fun to read. Couldn't put it down and even shed a little tear at the end. Thank you Mr Weir for a great read!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie was shipped very fast and I love this comedy horror movie. The person I gave it to never gets tired of seeing it over and over again.
0525952926|4.0|While I agree with other reviewers that the Century Trilogy has not, to this point, been nearly as good as the Pillars of the Earth books, nevertheless they are entertaining.<br /><br />If I were to make one recommendation to other readers, it would be to not necessarily read these books as soon as they are released. Mr. Follett is following a number of families through these books, interweaving their stories, and when you wait a year or more for the next book, I tend to forget those relationships and find myself struggling to remember how these two families on opposite sides of the world are related. I think the books would be much more compelling and engaging if they were read one after another.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game and it loads so easily. Great time but I hate the ads that show up when you try to lay
0385344228|5.0|I read this book back in March 2012, and 9 months later I still find myself thinking about it from time to time, wondering what I would do as a parent.<br /><br />I think that my first instinct, as any parent's, would be to deny that my child would commit any crime and defend him/her to the fullest extent possible. Then, as this story unfolds, I found myself questioning my judgment, and asking myself exactly what I would do. As horrible as it sounds to those who have read it, I almost feel that my life would follow exactly that of Jacob's mother.<br /><br />You have to read this book.
B008476HBM|5.0|Excellent book, I highly recommend it.  I will read it again.<br />Elizabeth character is most inspiring to have an open mind.
1451627297|5.0|I have always been fascinated by the assassination of JFK and the various theories surrounding one vs. many shooters and of course wanted to read this book as soon as it was released.<br /><br />I am so happy I did. I am not usually a sentimental person, but this book captivated me. Mr. King does a beautiful job of transporting you to the 1960s in the time travel of this book, and I truly felt as though I were living the story. Perhaps it is because the lead character is seeing the 1960s from the same perspective I would, seeing all of the oddities as I would see them.<br /><br />The exhaustive research that must have gone into this book, into where Oswald was at various times in the early 60s, is impressive. I was Googling and Street Viewing many times, looking at the houses where Oswald lived in those days, and probably just adding to my sense that I was being transported to this time in history.<br /><br />Then the climax of the story, which comes much too soon (even in this 800+ page book), was just amazing. I must say in closing that the end of the book was so beautiful that I found myself tearing up, which I cannot remember ever doing in any other book.<br /><br />If only I could find more books with stories of this power and beauty. I've loved almost all of Mr. King's books, but this one was truly my favorite.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|It was a bit slow, but the message was inspirational. I'm keeping mine nearby for whenever i feel negative. There needs to be more supermodels out there like her.
0525953728|5.0|You won't be able to put this book down. From page one to the dramatic end, this book carries you from one gripping story to another.<br /><br />I did find a few things in this book to be of particular interest, things that I do not know have been reported previously, or that disagree with the official story. First, in his account of the rescue of the American freighter captain Richard Phillips, I was not aware that the boat on which the pirates were holding Captain Phillips was in fact tethered to the US Navy ship, and that it was slowly winched in during the night to make those famous head shots more possible. There is also a strange account of a gunshot that got the attention of the last pirate, but this account ends so abruptly that I wonder if something was censored.<br /><br />In the account of the OBL raid, there are various details that disagree with the official story as it was released, from the details of the crash landing of the chopper to how OBL was ultimately killed.<br /><br />Really engaging and interesting book.
B0012909NQ|5.0|Besides the professional \\"official\\" recording of the Rome performance on the 2007 Turn it On Tour, the Genesis performance at Dusseldorf was simulcast to European movie theaters in HD and is also available on bitTorrent, again downloadable at your own risk (if you can find it). This HD performance is of the entire concert, not just the abridged version on Palladia HD. I have seen the HD recording of this concert at a friends house, encoded at 720p (1280x720), and again its breathtakingly better than the DVD sold here. This recording has similar camera angles and closeup shots as the Rome recording.<br /><br />I concur that this it an outstanding performance, both the event itself and the production work. It might be the  finest overall live performance I have seen on video from a circa 70s-80s-90s rock act. That this is shot on video and not film is also a great benefit. Recent film adaptations of rock concerts like Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones are disjointed w/rapid shifts of the camera.  The production values and camera work here of Serpent Productions, produced by Dione Orrom and directed by David Mallet, are outstanding.<br /><br />However, not releasing this performance as Blu-ray or even as an HD 1080p or 720p digital file on iTunes or Amazon is a regrettable, sad and a disgrace. And as such, even w/all the discs, the documentary and the booklet, $32.00 is a poor value. This is the price a blu-ray should fetch.<br /><br />Many of you may not realize that HD versions of this concert do in fact exist. The MTV-owned channel, Palladia HD, has broadcast an abridged version of Genesis in Rome in 1080i, although they rarely show it to their predominantly Gen X, Gen Y and millennial customers now.  I recorded the Palladia concert on my Tivo which is perfectly legal.  I can report that the HD quality (1080i upscaled to 1080p) is orders of magnitude better than this DVD. With the HD version, you can easily see the fine details of the hands of Tony Banks playing keyboards, Phil Collins face and the outstanding guitar and drum work. The sense of immediacy and intimacy is dramatic. And why not? HD contains 33% more detail than DVD and this is especially apparent on a live performance such as Genesis in Rome. DVDs are standard definition quality, 480p, an incremental improvement over 20th century square TVs with 480i. DVDs are notably and dramatically inferior to Blurays when it comes to a live performance.<br /><br />The Palladia HD recording is available online as a (bit)Torrent file for (illegal?) downloading. Since I recorded the show, which is perfectly legal, I don't need this file. Here, the recording industry is encouraging piracy by refusing to release a proper Bluray disc. They are offering the consumer a concert w/blurred faces and coarse detail when the HD video is right there under their noses. And the Palladia HD has only 1/2 the songs played at the Rome concert, probably due to some anti-consumer license w/the content owner.<br /><br />That said, both of these HD recordings put the DVD being sold here to shame, even w/all of its accompanying docudiscs and booklets.<br /><br />Caveat emptor!

B008MWBY6W|5.0|AmazonBasics continues to take the best generic qualities of other manufacturers and reproduce them at a more affordable price without sacrificing any quality.  This water-resistant bag is water-proof at the base which is made with EVA (Ethylene-vinyl acetate) which is typically used as a `shock absorber' in many products.  This is a great feature for a solid standup bag.<br /><br />The top of the case has a comfortable handle and a generous, very comfortable padded shoulder strap that is removable.  The sides have ample pockets (approximately 4\\" X 4\\") and a nifty front pocket that contains a folder for batteries/accessories and two very well protected pockets with Velcro flaps for SD Cards.<br /><br />The inside of the case is approximately 6\\" X 6\\" X 6\\" and is covered with a soft felt like material.  Two flexible cross bars hold your camera tightly by crossing the top and using Velcro on the ends of each to secure it to the sides of the interior.  This is ultimate protection.  I can't imagine this case not handling any DSLR with a zoom lens on the market, but to be fair, it won't hold much more than that.  If you only use it for \\"point 'n shoot cameras\\" and accessories, it would be more than perfect protection with extra room.  For a daily use with a DSRL and lens, this is perfect.  The price is a bargain.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I was turned on to Ram mounts from a friend and I now use them for everything. I use them on my bikes and quad for my gps and my go pro camera with out ever having to worry, because I know with this mount they will stay attached.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb is an accessible genius who makes sense of how life works and has done the math to prove his theses.  Among the great ideas I've come across in the last seventy years, this is one of the most profound.  Organic systems thrive on small variations.  &#34;What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.&#34;  The damage is done by well-meaning or dictatorial attempts to control and iron out the natural variations in life.  The book is easy to read with abundant examples and a humorous quips.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|The funniest parts were shown in the previews. Sad to think that's how we spent our New Years. Mila was great
0385340540|4.0|I love Grsham...his books are page turners. I especially loved this one because it was not only a great mystery, but a travelogue of Bologna, Italy. Grisham's description of the city made me want to go there...even tho I had visited before. I knew I had missed so much.<br /><br />If you don't enjoy that kind of thing, then you may not enjoy this novel. I, for one, did.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|Thought it would be fun, I was wrong. Little direction of what to do. Not fun trying to figure out how to do things. Moving to next level seemed impossible.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The acting, setting and storyline of Downton Abbey are superior. The success of the series is well earned. I look forward to viewing the later episodes.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|The simple/easy tunes are fun. When you get to the more advanced tunes, a little musical background sure would help, as well as nimble fingers!
0399157565|3.0|Very similar to previous books by Cornwell.  Things have not been the same since she changed publishers.  Hope the next one is better.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Just enough mystical stuff to allow all sorts of things to happen, but also lots of science to ground it.  Science similar to literary references in the Thursday Next series.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I used it for the first time when sewing and trying to adjust how much seam was needed on each side for an alteration.  It was easy and fun.  If I weren't so used to doing recipe alterations in my head, this would be perfect for that too.  A fun tool.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|The story was nothing like the original. It seems there were only a few scenes that were close to the old flick. Very disappointing. Collin Ferrel sub standard acting.....
B007VDN1PA|5.0|My goal is to digitize as many photos as I've taken over the past 40 years that I can. My preference is to do this with the negatives if possible. I've tried a couple of flat bed scanners, and some other \\"negative/slide\\" scanners over the past five years with ok to bad results. I decided to give it a try again and ordered the DB-Tech 35mm slide and negative scanner.<br />I like the way this scanner works, I don't have to load the negative strips into a special holder like on other scanners I've tried. I can just feed them through the slot. In the week and a half that I've had it I've scanned approximately 2,600 negatives. Most, say 95%, are scanning good enough for me, a photo hobbiest might not be happy with the results, but I think I'm getting as good or better an image on my computer as I look at in the photo album. The \\"bad\\" scans I am getting are all film that was processed at the same lab in the early 80's and have a green tint to them. Other than those negatives, everything that I've scanned aged from the late 70's to the early 2000's when our house switched to digital has scanned easily and quickly.<br />Very happy with my results and would recommend to others.<br /><br />(Edited to fix a couple of typos that were too obvious ;-)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|From the beginning The Pact had me intrigued. The whole of the book was beautifully written. The topics dealt with in it's pages were handled wonderfully and nudge the reader to look more closely at situations that they might have a gut reaction to. Love compels.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This trilogy of movies by Christopher Nolan has been a major series of my lifetime. I love Christian Bale. They really knocked this series out of the park, and it all culminated perfectly with The Dark Knight Rises.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy read.  I really enjoyed it.  This was my first book on . My kindle.  Very entertaining and relaxing book
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I love the 80's aspects and feel of this movie. The strength of the characters was superb, and the story line in itself took turns that made this movie very memorable. I recommend it to anyone with a flare for the legitimate film, and not so much just something to grasp your attention for a couple of hours.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love Sylvia Day. All her novels are amazing. This is my favorite series yet. So raw and the passion makes u want to be touched well.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Why does a movie about a great woman like Margaret Thatcher focus on the sad decline that occurs as a result of dementia?  That's like making a movie about Alexander the Great and focusing the majority of the movie on his last days while dying in bed.  A total waste of an opportunity to tell the story of one of the most influential people in the past 100 years while having at your disposal the services of perhaps the greatest actress of all time!  The achievements of Margaret Thatcher and the pivotal moments in history that she helped shape should have been thoroughly explored so that current and future generations would have something to remember.  That's how great movies are made.  This was a complete disaster that trivializes a great woman.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Keeps you guessing with Plum Humor!!<br />I Love these easy read FUN books. I recomend All the Stephanie Plum series!!!
1908117230|5.0|I was nervous about the book because of so many complaints about instructions but I wanted the book anyways. It was a pleasant surprise at how easy the instructions were.  I think its wonderful. I think as long as you have a kitchen scale that can switch to metric and a thermometer that reads both Celsius and Fahrenheit, you will be fine. I do think reading the intro before the recipes helps as well. The directions for each recipe assume that you have read the intro first. Also, great photos. I like for my cookbooks to have tantalizing photos.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|there is always a TWIST in Michael Connelly's book!<br />Loved it, Just when I think I know what's going to happen<br />BAM! twist
B00633W614|5.0|The Sins of The Father was a 'feel good' book. The writer moved you to England and the period of years ago.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how I can pick and choose which sounds I want to hear. I swear, this always makes me fall asleep every time I turn it on. I highly recommend downloading this, you will sleep like a baby.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|An unforgettable edition, high quality, truly an item collection. Very cute! I recommend to everyone! It is a great buy
B004AQR24W|1.0|For some this is a great action movie. For me, the first five minutes were all I could stand. The first scene battling the pirates may leave one embarrassed that they actually watched it. 5 minutes of my life wasted, but glad it wasn't more. I guess it depends on what you're looking for.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|An unforgettable edition, high quality, truly an item collection. Very cute! I recommend to everyone! It is a great buy
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Recipient very pleased, it meets all expectations therefore would happily recommend it. What more can I say. Thankyou very much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It constantly kept me on edge, wanting to read more, and I can't wait to read the next two books!
B0053O89WY|5.0|In review of this product I must say... How can you go wrong with a whole season of The Big Bang Theory???  Sheldon, Penny, Leonard, Raj, and Wolowitz... add in a bit of Amy and you have pure Big Bang JOY!!!
B004KD5TQI|5.0|Has a flavor all its own, like the film.<br />Though I must admit to liking the soundtrack better than the movie.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I thouht this book wasnt' up to cornwell usual style. far to much forensic info which took you away from where as a reader you wanted to go.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderfully written, acted and produced.  An enthralling story!  Each episode leaves you anxious for the next.<br />I  look forward to season 3's effort.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|Only drawback is there are no &#34;deleted&#34; scenes, which ARE on the UK, non-Masterpiece Theater, Blu-Ray but some of which were part of the PBS broadcasts.
B00117AXUS|5.0|Love lots of the songs. Beirut is a band that takes you somewhere far away. That's what I love about those guys.
B007MC0IAG|5.0|A nice philanthropic gesture would be to have this available in every school on the planet<br /><br />....and mandatory teaching to all young
B002COTI64|5.0|This is my first album of hers, and I was looking for something I could sing along with. She's right in my range, love her!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Good movie felt ending left more questions than answers I sense sequel. I do like Jeremy Renner in this role.
B0037BB00I|5.0|She sounds a little less mainstream on this album, a little jazzier and that's something she does like nobody else. She is awesome.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun game my kids like it too<br />I would recommend this<br />for fun times. it keeps you going looking for more clues.
B004NYQYNQ|4.0|I still love her, but you can tell someone's got ahold of her now and she's aiming to please the masses. Happens to the best of 'em.
B003FM1MNO|1.0|I rented this from Amazon because my son was eager to see it after seeing &#34; The Hobbit&#34;.  We were not able to watch it due to the film canstantly stopping to buffer.  I stopped it and started another film on Netflix which ran perfectly.
B003YOASY2|5.0|I love this one. It is such a classic. They are crass and inappropriate and so effing awesome that I could burst. Explosivo.
B002X9W50E|5.0|As time marches on and wizened old gamers on the music scene inevitably rack up tons of live albums in their catalogue, it's often the case that those live albums become lazy and uninspiring.  After all, why would the Stones really wish to release the umpteenth live album with the latest runthrough of Satisfaction?  Becuase that version has something the others don't?  Because they need to pay the bills?  Keith needs another transfusion?<br /><br />Certainly coming out several years after the actual tour, one would first think that maybe Mr. Bowie is just needing to pay some bills.  After all he has been mining the archives a lot lately and is not recording anymore since his health scare.  Maybe that was the point.  Maybe it isn't.  With this live album, who cares becuase it is amazing.  David Bowie is a rare musician that can make a live show seem new and fresh every single time after so many years in the game.<br /><br />It's a great mix of songs and personally I am glad he is paying some special attention to his Berlin trilogy in this set.  The songs are energetic, fresh, and as usual compelling.  This is a live album you want in your music collection.
B000VH4OCW|5.0|Stevie wonder is incredible. He wrote some of the greatest songs of all time, several of which are on this album. Required listening!!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|As a vegan runner, it is so very inspirational to hear Scott's story of endurance and triumph.  It reinforced wonderful concepts of wellness!
1577314808|5.0|Read it as intended, in small bites over a long period.  It was life changing for me.  I read it in conjunction with The New Earth and the concepts in these books has freed me from emotional baggage like nothing else ever has.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like minecraft but this app needs armor and lava. and creative is nothing like Pc creative. But its still cool.
0425263908|1.0|As other readers have stated, this book is indeed very, very similar to 50 Shades. I knew this going in, after receiving this on a recommendation from a co-worker, and so this didn't necessarily surprise me nor bother me. What did bother me was the asinine plot! To make this review fair, I will say that I wasn't that intrigued by 50 Shades either, and, in fact, thought it was severely overrated. Let me add, however, that once I began 50 Shades, I found myself continuing to turn the pages, despite the heavy eye-rolling and occasional sigh. With Bared to You, I had to FORCE myself to finish the book, and the only reason I did this was because, one, I really can't stand starting and not finishing a novel, and two, I go back to work next week and I will be returning my co-worker's book (who raved about how she had the greatest book for me to read over my Christmas break). As with 50 Shades, I found the plot very formulaic and lacking in creativity. It's really just a matter of guy goes after girl, girl plays hard to get, guy eventually gets girl, both girl and guy exhibit their insecurities (girl--low self-worth; guy--need to control because of past abuse), and in between they have really great sex. ***If you are reading this for the sex scenes alone, then, by all means, go read this book! They do it quite often (even following a sexual assault, which left me feeling more dirty than aroused), and Day does do a good job of describing these scenes in detail.  If you are after a good plot, that exceeds the simplistic drivel of teeny bopper love stories, then this might not be for you.
B009O2XY12|2.0|This  is an immature game which needs more challenges and self competitive levels which make you want to play the game. The general idea is good.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It was a nice family movie- enjoyed watching it with the kids. Would not watch again but nice to see.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Following the release of Evangelion 1.11, this movie continues the re-editing of this classic series. There are more evident and profound changes in this second part than there were in the first one in relation to the classic, which might make some hardcore fans uncomfortable, but now you can start to glimpse where the story is heading too, differently from the original, which had a strange ending (although the series was still superb).<br /><br />From a technical perspective, this movies continues the video and audio wonder of 1.11. The recreated angels are awesome and the whole film is crystal clear and jaw dropping. The addition of CGI to the traditional animation does no detract from the film and makes it more beautiful, in contrast to the blu-ray edition of Ghost in the Shell, which had the first opening sequence remade in CGI in a way that did not blend in very well to the original animation.<br /><br />Now, we just need to wait for the third installment, which won´t be around until late 2013 or 2014.
B0044KJIIC|5.0|Always love watching this show. Too bad its over but it was fun to re-watch with out the commercials. Thanks
B009Y2KGSQ|4.0|I hate classic rock radio: how many times do you need to hear \\"Stairway?\\"  However, I can't quit Aerosmith.  I have 74 Aerosmith tracks on my Mp3 player.  At their best, Perry's licks and Tyler's raunch trump even Jagger and Richards.<br /><br />\\"Music From Another Dimension!\\" would be a great album if it were cut down to LP size.  \\"Out Go the Lights\\" and \\"Street Jesus\\" fit in nicely with the best of their rest.<br /><br />We need Aerosmith - and the Stones - to give us those sloppy blues riffs with attitude to remind us of why we love rock and roll.  Aerosmith is still genuine and even relevant, but only for 30-40 minutes instead of the hour they give us.  Pick your favorite tracks and you have another solid album.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game cause toucans get all the way up to x30 and I was at mission 52 and it reset the whole game but I am back up there on mission 30 again and it freezes a lot but hey. I lobe the game.
0446554995|1.0|Preston and Child obviously have their creative days behind them. Too bad, all they have been able to achieve this time, is a boring wannabe Nazi plot (how imaginative...). While their previous books were realy compelling, this time I wasn't able to read more then 1/3 of this book. Save your money.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game a lot this is not to bad for 0.99 cents that you have to pay for.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I thought this movie could have been way better than what it is. It is boring and predictable. I was not impressed.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This movie is AMAZING!  I recommend anyone that enjoys movies to watch it. Love love love it1 recommend it highly
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|A fun game that requires minimal thought but provides lots of fun, especially if you want to earn all of the trophies.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|This was a cute and fun movie.  While I doubt it will become a classic, it is certainly one I'd watch again.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|my favorite movie of all times. and leo is excellent. you cant help but love him. id go down with the ship for him
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I didn't have high expectations for the film, but we ended up laughing quite a bit.  It's pretty crass but funny nontheless.
B0063M22QO|5.0|addicting!!! great brain game!!!!  i also play on my computer. dont leave home without it. a must have for all challenge enthusiasts
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|This soundtrack, like the show, is just so-so in my humble opinion.  I don't mean to criticize, but Connie's voice is so nasal, dull and flat... it is like hearing fingernails on a chalkboard each time she sings.  And her songs are pretty weak.  Hayden's voice is alot better (IMO) but she too suffers from mostly weak choices of songs that were given to her.  I think the stand-outs are Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio.  They make magic together each and every time they collaborate.  I would have prefered a whole album of their songs alone.  It was also frustrating that the CD initially was mislabelled, and &#34;Fade Into You&#34; was not included.  What a wasted opportunity.  Perhaps they are planning on putting it on the next volume.  And that leads me to wonder if they plan on releasing multiple CDs each year, attempting to milk out as much money from us as possible.  PLEASE DON'T.  Only ONE CD with all the strongest tracks (per season) should suffice.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Thanatophobia - \\" The fear of death \\" rules my life and has been getting worse as time goes by. Reading this book has brought relief and hope to me. Authored by a very educated scientist / doctor and I presume well off financially man makes me trust in its content all the more.....Why ? Because as a scientist he has forged ahead against : what most of his colleagues believe ( which I'm sure affected him negatively in their eyes ) , against everything he was taught,  and what he himself believed for years. And I also doubt being a man who was greatly respected and we'll off authored this just out of greed....... He was surrounded by so many others who could attest to this miracle.  This book strengthens my belief in GOD that has been growing as I get older and knocks down any little doubt I did have.... Am I still scared to die ? Of course I am, but it is less intense now and I will continue to read others experiences , have faith ,  hope and love , and to keep praying to GOD to see me through... Thank you for sharing your story Dr. Alexander and spreading GODS message to us all ; that he is REAL and that he LOVES us !!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|And so I have reached the end. Finally. The book was ok. Read it if you are in a bad mood, if you want someone to take it out on because it would be bad form to do so to the people who really irritate you. It is a small, angry, petty book. The ending left me feeling even worse than the book itself.<br /><br />Then I realized something... these characters are just hyperbolical examples of people we meet every day, whether we know it or not. It reminded me to never feel sorry for anyone in their relationship because, chances are, they are where they are because it works for them on some level. This is certainly true of these two characters. They feed off each other and can not stop because without their twisted manipulative counterpart, each has no idea who he or she is... Vicious circle, yes. But surely, one that is self-created.<br /><br />So I give the book two stars. It reinforced an important lesson. Apart from that it was only \\"meh\\". It is certainly not much of a mystery, or even a thriller in my opinion. Definitely not one of the best books of 2012.<br /><br />And that's how it looks from my chair. :)
B0000DK4RM|5.0|This arrived brand new and fairly quickly. My sister and I used to watch this when we were younger and it was awesome to be able to find it online to give to her as a gift. Thanks!
0439023513|5.0|Finished series in record time due to getting book before the holidays.  Thanks so much for the excellent service in getting my order to me.
B007RI56NY|4.0|Download was simple and cost effective as usual.  Music is what I expect from Train...catchy tunes and quirky lyrics...I'm hooked on them.  Can't beat the price of $5!!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Looking forward to getting into this series. This first book did not disappoint and I'm confident the rest will keep me wanting to know the remainder of the tragic story of the Bauldelair orphans.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This is another fantastic score for another fun movie.  The new themes that Shore created are intertwined with the known themes of Middle Earth.  If you love music that tells a story, get this soundtrack!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I had never really listened to him before. I also bought his newest cd and liked it...but this one is my most favorite. You will enjoy every song on this album...yes...I still call them albums. Can't help it.
B004NS710C|5.0|If you know anyone who likes trains they will love this movie. Lots of great camera shots and a pretty good storyline as well. Apparently it is based on true events so that makes it even better.
B005HSL626|5.0|works awesome on the kindle, super fun on the coaster or car rides. No complaints to speak about, especially when it's a free app.
0525457585|5.0|When my daughter was in the fourth grade Harry Potter mania hit and everyone was going crazy! Angie's fourth grade teacher sent home a spelling and vocabulary lists full of words from Harry Potter.  I bear J.K. Rowling no ill will, her stories were very good and the fact that she got a lot of children interested in reading is wonderful. I wanted my daughter to know that there were plenty of A-M-A-Z-I-N-G fantasy stories out there, stories that were magical and would grab you and take you to worlds you had never imagined.  We couldn't wait to check in on Bastian and be transported with Atreyu to Fantasia.  We had enjoyed the movie but we found so much more magic in the book from the different colors of ink used to indicate the setting to the wonderful places in Fantasia such as the &#34;Perilin the Night Forest&#34; which grows only at night and is illuminated like neon and &#34;Goad, the Desert of Colors&#34; which is ruled by a lion Grograman who changes colors depending on what color sand he is touching.<br />The book is an absolute joy to discover and a wonderful gateway to the world of Fantasy leading to the Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, A Wrinkle in Time, A Lion, A Witch and a Wardrobe and yes, even Harry Potter.
B00005R24K|1.0|Let me start with the best warning I can give, if you watch this film, it's time you will never get back ! It's badly filmed, horribly acted, and without a doubt a huge waste of time. There are many B movies much better then this film. You been warned !!!
B005LAII12|5.0|Warning: THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE. I know the premise of a teddy bear suggests that this would be \\"ok\\" for kids, but it isn't. However, as an adult, I enjoyed it very much. It's not overly gross (which isn't something I'm a fan of), but it does have shock-value moments. Has a weird sweetness to it as well. Mila Kunis and Mark Walhburg are great. Contains: the f-word, pot smoking, alcohol, all forms of intercourse, cocaine use, prostitutes...and inside jokes if you've ever seen an episode of \\"Family Guy.\\" Enjoyable for a date night movie ;)
B005J9ZFQG|1.0|Although the filming is somewhat better then the original, and the directing is better. This movie is still no better. I know hundreds of so called B movies that are better then this film. The acting is horrible, please don't waste your time you will never get it back.
1442359315|5.0|This book was an easy read in a 2 1/2 hour car trip. What a wonderful gift Eben was given. I got to the end and had tears running down my cheeks. It confirmed what I have always believed and it is a book for those who don't have a belief in God as well as for those with a belief but question. I finished the book and for lack of a better description I felt completely safe and full of peace. The title is perfect. Thank you Eben for writing this book.
1401924751|5.0|I love this deck, the cards are very nice and the box is very sturdy.  The cards are beautiful and just what I expected.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Great book. I was surprised that it was so different from the movie. Great read for any age. Must read.
B009VB97EY|3.0|This movie wasn't horrible, and it wasn't great. Granted, it's about male strippers, but from the advertisements, I thought it was going to be more of a comedy. There were a couple of funny scenes, but it just wasn't what I expected. Like I said before, I've seen worse!
B002YK8OKC|5.0|It is real refreshing to watch a reenactment of my Christmases of long past. I would recommend everyone to watch. Beware there are a few swears but nothing like today's movies.
B0058BI864|5.0|gets funnier with every epsiode!  Great dynamics and a great supporting cast!  I lhave not laughed out loud so often while watching a single show.Bazinga!!
B009KHBDUU|5.0|Johny Depp is just amazingly funny in this movie. I truly loved the story line. I would recommend this movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. It kept me interested from the very beginning. Colleen Hoover is a very talented author, who can weave a story together very well. She does not disappoint.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a creatively written page turner. I enjoyed it. The 90's throwbacks (song references, etc.) are entertaining. It definitely hooked me and is true to its title. I never thought about whether or not I was a &#34;participant&#34; in &#34;normal&#34; high school life or not, but this book makes you think about social life from another angle. Fun read.
0345803485|5.0|This book did not disappoint at all... I have just finished the 3rd book and found there was a good story which ran through all 3 books.
B002ZBPPHA|4.0|This movie really surprised me in a good way!  I thought it was just a scary movie that my teenager told me about. While it was scary, it also had a great plot with some great underlying messages. Will Smith was great is his role. Definitely NOT for younger kids because some images shown would be very scary to them. Adults and late teens only.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|It was tough to get through the first few pages. The prose didn't seem to read smoothly to me. I may revisit this one though because it is a classic.
B001HMSFFC|3.0|Good story about the bond of friendship. It will make you laugh out loud, cry bigs tears and the range of all emotions. Definitely a movie for adults only.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|If it's mindless action fun you want, that's what you'll get from this sequel to the earlier Stallone hit of the same name. An elite band of mercenaries takes on any challenge, just as long as the guns are very big, the villains are very bad, and the body count will be very high. Lots of explsions, along with a long parade of most of the slightly over-the-hill action heroes of our day. You know 'em, you love 'em, and here you get a lot more of 'em. Silly? You bet. And that's just fine with me.
1419701533|5.0|My 9 year old son asked for all these books for Christmas. He reads whenever he gets a chance, sprawling out on the couch, taking them wherever we are going and reading before bed. He re-reads ones he has already read and reads passages and cartoons he finds funny to the rest of us. This set was an excellent purchase.
B005I6EU48|4.0|Arrived quickly and is exactly as described. Saw the same one in WalMart for $40 and had to find it on amazon to see if they had it for a much more reasonable price. I did and I absolutely LOVE it. I have it stashed in my bookcase so it blends in and no one can mess with it :)
B008LSVLVA|5.0|I got this for my husband who is a music buff and he loved it - he's a big fan of Porcupine Tree and says its great
