B004YM6JLO|5.0|If you like paranormal, this series has it all. The characters are interesting and each have a backstory. The soundtrack couldn't have been improved upon. I've read the books, watched the tv series and the followup books by Stephan's diaries. They are similar but all three are different and that is what makes this series a must have.<br /><br />The only thing that would make it better is hmmmm nothing. :)<br /><br />[[ASIN:0062003933 Origins (The Vampire Diaries, Stefan's Diaries, Vol. 1)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061963860 The Vampire Diaries: The Awakening]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002JVWR9U The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season]]
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Awesome product. I got it for about $20 cheaper than Target while it was on sale!! Totally worth every penny
0756688701|5.0|My son loves Disney cars and cars in general.  He is almost two and will \\"read\\" my dad's car books, so I thought he would like his own book of cars.  It is his favorite book now.  It is bulky because the front section has a toy car in it, but he doesn't mind.
B0091QS88K|5.0|Fun game. My daughter enjoys making the food and cleaning the dishes send table. I def recommend this game. At first there was a little trouble getting the customers from their cars to the tables but looks like that has resolved itself.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accuweather app is so much better than the weather channel.  The information is easier to read and more relevant to my area.  Call me crazy but I think the storm forcast is more important than the pollen report.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|\\"WE\\" the people, thank God,& pray everyday, for the safety and well being<br />of our brave men and women in our military. Just to wear the uniform, is \\"no easy day\\".<br />this book is very well written.It takes us through  the planning stage and right to the actual take down.. i find this book,very informative and also non- self promoting. It also brings to light, how special these folks are,that put themselves in harms way. Solely for the safety, and betterment,of the USA and our citizens...<br />\\"WE\\" must never forget our troops,past and present. there are so many things,that we<br />can do. besides buying this book , as proceeds go to the wounded veterans.<br />we can volunteer in VA hospitals, send letters of encouragement to our wounded men and women that have worn the uniform..they have given so much,and  receive so little...we, must remember, Freedom is not free....support our troops...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an awesome app. I love that you can see what you typed underneath. loooooooooooooooove it very much and recommend this app.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I gave this book a 5/5 because it helps you find from the hardest of words to the new harder ones I am learning. ;)
B007H9B8FS|2.0|Been a fan of G since the beginning. Love every album but this one. Lyrics are weak and its all in all just boring. Been watching the live shows online and Shirley sounds bad and just doesn't have the edge anymore. Very disappointing.
B007THA4FI|1.0|CV has, (according to the Kindle description) 81 characters.  Going into the book I guessed that, somewhere amongst those 81 characters, there would be someone who wasn't both boring and a terrible person.  I was wrong.<br /><br />JK has managed to take 81 horrible people who do horrible things... and somehow blended them into one amorphous bundle of yawn.<br /><br />I did finish the book... but mostly because I simply could not believe it would stay as bad all the way through.  I was, again, wrong.<br /><br />So- if you are looking for a book filled with depressingly adult actions (drugs, rape, etc), but a thematic element that is on par with maybe what an 8th grader would be able to understand, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />Otherwise... well... Harry Potter was a really good series.
0394800184|2.0|My son picks this book out a lot to read before bedtime.  I always oblige and read it to him.  But out of all of his books this one I enjoy the least.  It's not because there is some moral objection to the book. It's not due to the fact that the bird is lost and afraid.  Most other reviews say something about the book being upsetting for those kids that are adopted.<br /><br />For kids it is a good book.  I would just rather read some other book as it's not as \\"fun\\" as other books I suppose.  So I usually read this one first and then read something like, \\"Put me in the zoo.\\"<br /><br />Just my observation.  I find the writing dull and predictable.  It just seems like it would be simple for someone, anyone, to sit down and write a book of similar nature.  Put me in the Zoo and Bear in Underwear are easy for me to read to my son every night.  Whenever he hands me this book I have the thought, \\"ugh, not again.\\"
B004LWZWGK|4.0|And Bane is no Joker.  I liked this movie and want to watch several more times...but it is no where near what Dark Knight was.  Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies of all time, I can watch it over and over, and it is a masterpiece - perfect pacing - all of the story lines mesh beautifully.  Dark Knight is a piece of art - all the performances are top notch - the Ledger performance is one of the best of all time - not exaggerating.<br /><br />Dark Knight Rises?  Good movie, some cool scenes and some signature moments - but long, and dragging in places, and sometimes even nonsensical in my opinion.  Kind of choppy too - it doesn't have the beautiful \\"flow\\" of Dark Knight - Dark Knight is simply one of the rare perfect movies...Rises is FAR from that.  Bane just has no charisma.  He is very \\"blah\\" as a character, whereas Joker is one of the greatest characters in the history of movies as portrayed by the great Heath Ledger.<br /><br />Dark Knight Rises is a cool movie...but far FAR from perfect, and thus, far FAR from The Dark Knight masterpiece.

B008N1V11U|4.0|ok I got it for a great price.But how do you load it?my kindle is out of space and needs more any ideals?I have cleared my files.is there a sd card for kindle?thanks mike
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Anthony Ryan's book is an engaging journey told by the main character and a scribe. The book is hard to put down, and easy to return to reading. The emotions are real, and characters are as well developed as the story demands. There is a nice balance between action, thought and dialog through out the book. I greatly enjoyed the book and would like to read more.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|perfect toy for kids from 1 to 5! I have a 3 and 5 year old - both loved this toy. Very well made! their baby sisters - 1 year olds - love it too!  super cute. It was a great gift for an airplane ride too!
B008FOB124|5.0|I was thrilled with Dead Can Dance at the Beacon, and I am thrilled every time I hear Anastasis!  Lisa has not missed a beat (or a note) and Brandon is better than ever.  His voice is so powerful and full of passion!!  The CD was sold out at the theater, and Amazon had it to me in short order.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Plot was a little thin, but Jack always comes through. Plenty of drama. Plenty of excitement. A page turner that you can't put down.
0984183523|5.0|Amazing insights to prepare for consulting interviews. Victor through his book has articulated how others can crack into the top consulting firms. Absolutely brilliant!
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|Very disappointed that the product description was a bit misleading in that most of the interesting extra content is only available on the Blu-ray disc and NOT on the DVD disc.  Deleted scenes, Gag Reel, Short film - NONE of these are on the DVD.  ONLY on the Blu-ray version.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is very entertaining. There are a few management nuggets, thus living up to its title. It was so funny in parts that I read them to my husband and we laughed together.
0553807919|4.0|Does this book take a very complex topic and simplify it? YES.  And as a someone attempting to juggle parenthood, marriage, homeownership, a career, pets, and extended family, I am VERY thankful that this book isn't too \\"heavy.\\"  A previous reviewer mentioned that there are no research studies cited throughout the book.  Good for you if you have time to look up the data from those studies.  But I DON'T have that kind of time available.<br /><br />I need easy to understand, quick tips, to help me talk my 3 year old down off the ceiling in the midst of a temper tantrum.  I need help redirecting my child when I see a meltdown building.  And this very simple, quick read, has provided me with the tools I need to accomplish these goals.<br /><br />I recently attended a lecture given by Dr. Siegel and he started off by apologizing to all the fellow neuropsychiatrists in the room for the simplicity of this book.  He said that he didn't write the book for them.  He wrote it for busy parents that need simple, easy to remember techniques for managing these tricky phases of their children's development.<br /><br />THANK YOU, Dr. Siegel.  So far, so good.  Your book has been a blessing in our home.
B005FISBTO|3.0|This season was much less interesting. Kind of hokey. Very little real suspense. I did manage to avoid the spoiler for several episodes and then forgot and saw it at about episode 8 or 9. Meh. I wanted to like it but it was bland compared to earlier seasons.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is easy and fun and so far hasn't created any problems for my kindle fire. I like it.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|If you are a fan of Pink Floyd BUY THIS DON'T THINK ABOUT IT JUST BUY IT.<br /><br />Yes it's that good. The audio quality is superb, it's quite difficult to properly mix a symphony and a rock band (hello metallica im talking to you), but Gilmour (and his team) shows the world how it's done properly.<br /><br />I have watched this show multiple times already...definitely worth the $.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|offers a lot of options, simple and perfect soothing sounds and combos. best rain app i have come across so far.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love being able to play Spider Solitaire on my Kindle Fire.  Now I can play on my computer, my phone and my Kindle.  I love this game and will play it whenever I can. Now that is easier then ever.
0307742539|4.0|lLast of the 3 and a bit slow moving but picks up as ending nears.  Really believeable and great storylines.  Following all of the individuals and understanding them is the author's way of the suspense make sense as it starts to unfold.  Good read.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I just started reading only on the 3rd chapter but so far it has lots of action<br />and wants me to read on--So far it was worth 9.95. I love it
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a story about storytelling and about us.  Do we really want the truth or do we just want to hear (or remember) a good story?  Do we want cold facts or do we want adventure, inspiration, or some deeper meaning of what we are or why we are here? Yann Martel raises all these questions but ultimately leaves the answers up to the reader to answer for themselves.<br /><br />One word of caution: don't skip the Author's Notes.  The fun starts there.  Yes, there is a town of Pondicherry in southern India; yes, it has a botantical garden, no, it has never had a zoo (it has an aquarium).  The Indian Coffee House in downtown Pondicherry where he first hears of Pi's story is a real place; but the person he hears it from is made up. Several of the people he thanks are fictitious, but some are real.  There are stories and stories within stories.<br /><br />If you want you can read this as a simple adventure story but it also rewards a detailed literary perusal.  It's all up to you: the reader.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a must have you will love it keeps track of battery time so you don't have to so you can always be ready to fire up
B008J9EYFG|4.0|A lot has changed since Beth Orton's last album six years ago: she's now a wife and a mother.  For all that may have changed in her life, her music is as good as it has ever been on SUGARING SEASON.  Orton has all but dropped the electronic influences of her past in favor for a more mystical, roots-based brand of trippy instrumentation.  The production here works wonderfully, sometimes feeling loose and relaxed, at others tense and slightly paranoid; each song is able to create a nice landscape for Orton to wander in.  Songs range from the childlike \\"See Through Blue,\\" the melancholy and jazzy \\"Something More Beautiful,\\" the skittering and beautiful \\"Dawn Chorus,\\" and the elegaic closing track \\"State of Grace.\\"  What shines here though, is Orton's voice.  Simultaneously captivating, soulful, and trancelike, her vocals fill up every song to the brim.<br /><br />The closest point of comparison I can think of is Cat Power (circa her release of THE GREATEST).  The weakest point of this album is that it starts off so strongly - the second half of the album doesn't quite live up to the first; it's not as adventurous or experimental, suggesting that Orton is best when she's pushing herself creatively.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"Magpie,\\" \\"Dawn Chorus,\\" and \\"Candles.\\"  This is a great autumn/winter record - one that you can lose yourself in for a while.
0525953728|5.0|An excellent read. Well written and a very informative look at what Seal life appears to be like. I could not see how anything was overly revealing from a classified standpoint. Highly recommend.
B009I0QTF8|4.0|It seems like every time Flying Lotus is mentioned, his connection to the family's connections to the jazz world is also brought up.  On first glance, it feels like a piece of trivia - Flying Lotus is related to the Coltrane family? - but after listening to his music, it starts to make perfect sense.  The brand of electronic that Flying Lotus crafts has a certain jazz-element to it, and once you hear it, you can't miss it.  This connection to jazz feels stronger than ever on the LA-based producer's UNTIL THE QUIET COMES; tracks like \\"All the Secrets\\" and \\"See Thru to U\\" have a freeform fusion feel them, and at other times, the way that Flying Lotus's compositions come together (and drift apart) feel like an accomplished jazz piece.<br /><br />This album isn't extremely accessible - it darts between ideas and sketches of songs, and there isn't a truly consistent through-line to guide listeners.  Often, UNTIL THE QUIET COMES feels like a sketchpad where Flying Lotus was able to throw down ideas while in the studio.  The producer leaves just enough room in these compositions for listeners to lose themselves in, but often these songs are over just as they find their footing.  The second half of the album feels more cogent, with tracks flowing into one another, and transitions happening a bit more naturally.<br /><br />There are a few guest moments on UNTIL THE QUIET COMES.  Sometimes these collaborations feel inconsequential: \\"See Thru to U\\" features Erykah Badu and \\"Electric Candyman\\" features Thom Yorke, but these guest spots feel like they could have done by anyone; it doesn't feel like there's much for them to do here.  The other spots (with Niki Randa and Laura Darlington) also have the same vaporous absence of personality (on part by the vocalists), but it works, because the voices become just another instrument in Flying Lotus's arsenal.  The spacey weirdness Thundercat brings to \\"DMT Song\\" makes it a winner, and it often evoked memories of Mr. Bungle's work in the 90's.<br /><br />UNTIL THE QUIET COMES is an interesting followup to COSMOGRAMMA - his previous album was packed with instrumentation.  Here, the producer lets his songs breathe, but often at the expense of some of these tracks feeling not completely finished or though out.  This album does reward repeated listens, and I would suggest that listeners give it a few samples before giving up on it.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"Putty Boy Strut,\\" \\"All In,\\" and \\"DMT Song.\\"  There's something here for everyone, but it's up to them to explore UNTIL THE QUIET COMES.he 90's.<br /><br />UNTIL THE QUIET COMES is an interesting followup to COSMOGRAMMA - his previous album was packed with instrumentation.

B008XG1X18|5.0|The functionality of this app is very impressive. The same functions are available here as on the website, and it's very user-friendly!
0984183523|5.0|This book very nicely summarizes the entire process of getting ready for consulting case interviews. At the same time, it is very detailed and specific (for example, the part about written case interviews tells you how to lay out the slides and even how to label them). I found that rereading parts of this book a few days before an interview really helped me get into the mindset of the interviewers to understand what they're looking for, which really helps with that \\"I don't know what to make of what just happened\\" feeling that you get after the interviews. Definitely recommend, and good luck!
1575666286|5.0|If you have some sort of illnesses, or know someone that does, this for you. Your doctor is and always will be lying to you. You don't need medicine, the only medicine you need is food. Take this seriously.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|A beautiful movie based off of actual events in the life of Dr. John Nash. Very compelling story filled with surprises, laughs, and tears.  Well done Ron Howard movie as always.  If you have not watched it yet, you have done yourself a disservice. Great twists and turns to keep you guessing the whole way through!
B00007LTIA|5.0|I read a lot of reviews about this recording everything from \\"it's pure genius\\" to \\"it's absolute rubbish.\\" I recently bought this again on CD (I grew up with the vinyl) and listened to it again after 30 years from beginning to end and I personally lean toward the pure genius end of the spectrum. Yes Keyboardist Rick Wakeman hated this CD and it was said to be the main reason why he quit Yes, but sorry Rick there is a lot of magic here on these 2 CD's, your playing included. It's definitely a magical ride. Sit back and take a listen. It's a clear testament as to why Yes was one of the greatest bands of their and every time.
6305313687|4.0|This movie is the reason Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors.  This really puts you in the mindset of troubled youth and how easily they are munipulated.  I enjoyed every aspect of this movie except for the acting of Edward Furlong.  He was the same kid from the T2 movie and has no depth to his acting ability.
B008PJ3IDO|5.0|Just saw these guys live here in Seattle and was blown away. Great live band and this record is very solid all the way through. Jeff has a unique gravely voice that is dark at times and he lays down some great lyrics to back it. Duff delivers some killer bass lines and Barrett has that signature drum style that I love! Already Dead and Two Tickets are my current favorite tracks but as I listen others are starting to move their way to the top. Solid 5 stars for sure!
0765365278|5.0|Life before death.  Strength before weakness.  Journey before Destination.    Thousands of years past, in the lands of Roshar - a land of stones and storms. Storms so powerful and frequent as to have shaped both land and civilization alike. - the Oathpact of the Heralds has come to an end. Forsaking their vows to lead mankind against the Desolations which have ravaged Roshar since the exile of humanity from the Tranquiline Halls. Leaving humans to rely upon the Knight's Radiant for centuries until they too fall; leaving only their mystical swords and armor which give ordinary men the power and near-invincible warrior prowess.    Now, after the King of Alethkar was assassinated; war has waged for seven years on the Shattered Plains against the race of the Parshendi. Contesting against each other to navigate across the plains - finding ways across chasms spanning sixty or more feet deep. The Alethi fight to honor the Vengeance path and to prove their abilities against the other high princes by acquiring gem hearts.    The story follows multiple characters. The main three being Dalinar - the king's uncle, and brother to the assassinated king, he must find a way to unite the princes and redirect the war. Kaladin, an ex-soldier, slave and now a bridgeman working for one of the high princes, he seeks for a way to keep his crew alive and battle the odds. And Shallan a young artist who seeks retribution and money in order to save her family. Their situations all come at a cost - however, the price may be too high to pay.    Sanderson's The Way of Kings is an epic fantasy spanning over a thousand pages long with political intrigue, discovery, magic and action-packed scenes. The world and the characters are both compelling in their own rights; with hints of demonic creatures, lost histories and old magic returning. He excels at keeping readers interested, with nary a dull moment throughout the entire book. Readers of  high fantasy won't disappointed. Every chapter holds something new and hints of secrets, regrets, and of history.    Brandon does a wonderful job and keeps true to his style of developing an original magic system. The Way of Kings sets up the groundwork wonderfully for the next nine books of the Stormlight Archive, leaving readers hanging for more.  Book two is set to be released sometime next year.    ---    This review was originally posted at [...]
B008UTV6S8|3.0|The last time I saw Paul live was after Rhythm of the Saints, and man was there some energy in that room/stadium! Not so much here. It's nice to have a career-spanning live set (with a little too much time spent on lesser recent efforts), but in the end it deserves a sitting ovation. A few songs are truly reinvented and invigorated (mostly from Graceland), but largely we get either note-for-note recreations of the studio recordings, or worse, what sound like demo versions of the studio recordings, with one or more parts/instruments missing. Definitely a low-key affair.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|As a longtime Prog fan, I found BBT's newest release with Underfall Yard as Proof that BBT is at the Head of the Class. English Electric pt 1 features the musicianship, lyric tenderness, and transcendence found in the best of Prog music.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|First and most of second were engaging but the last book was weak. A very big disappointment. The writer flexed between addressing an adult and an adolescent audience.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a real must for any level of Bible reader. It allows you to bookmarks things and search for deeper references.
B0085LMFAE|4.0|As far as the album itself, this is one of the best albums Paul Simon has ever released. Even though I was already familiar with South African music before the original release, Mr. Simon still managed to create a unique, magical moment partly due to his own genius, and partly due to the mixture of guest musicians he picked. I first bought this on vinyl, and it was also one of the first CD purchaces I ever made. And while the sound quality of the original CD isn't bad, the gain is pretty weak compared to a lot of newer things.<br /><br />Before deciding to download the MP3 version of the 25th anniversary remaster release, I took into consideration the review posted here by Giacomo Holdini. Always nice to get the audiophile's opinion, which I recommend you take into account before you buy.<br /><br />However, for my purposes, this version has done what I wanted it to do: sound better on the less than ideal stereo in my truck, and on my better but still not audiophile quality home stereo. Also, with the higher gain, the songs mix better with the other random and newer songs that pop up on my MP3 player. The clipping mentioned in Giacomo Holdini's review isn't noticable on my equipment, so what I've gotten, and I think what most people will get, is a very enjoyable listening experience of a very special and unique album.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Aimee Mann's latest effort of pop perfection, \\"Charmer,\\" delivers on all levels--musically, lyrically, and thematically.  Ms. Mann writes catchy, pithy melodies that mask insightful lyrics often about unpleasant situations or dysfunctional personalities.<br /><br />\\"Charmer\\" is a modern-day musical \\"Canterbury Tales.\\"  As we walk along the road, we encounter, not the cook or the summoner, but a cast of characters that should be involved in deep psychoanalysis. We discover a couple that detest each other and who are \\"Living a Lie,\\" a father in \\"Gumby\\" he seems to have forgotten that he has a daughter who he needs his care, and in \\"Labrador,\\" we meet a person in a relationship that displays a canine-like  loyalty, which turns out not to be a good thing for both concerned.  My favorite is \\"Gumby,\\" where the narrator exhorts Gumby to get a backbone, but apparently to no avail.<br /><br />Ms. Mann voice is perfect for the songs she writes. At time, she reminds me of Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders and at other times she resembles Carly Simon. By the way, although she has a rich songbook, would it not be fun to hear her cover a Pretenders' song in concert, for instance \\"Don't Get Me Wrong?\\"  \\"Living a Lie\\" is a near perfect duet with The Shins' James Mercer. I like this vocal pairing as much as Alison Krauss and Robert Plant.<br /><br />I like all the music on the album, but the Cars-like \\"Charmer,\\" \\"Gumby,\\" \\"Gamma Ray,\\" and \\"Living a Lie\\" are the liveliest. Be sure to wear a seatbelt for these songs in concert or you might end up lost in space.<br /><br />Ms. Mann ends \\"Charmer\\" with the foreboding sounding \\"Red Flag Diver.\\" No matter how rough the seas and how clear the warning, something deep down inside compels us to jump into relationships that we should not. It turns out it is very difficult to alter human conditioning wired to make bad decisions. Ah, Ms. Mann! Ah, humanity!
B008V0OLOW|2.0|I am not at all in like with this CD.  While a huge fan of her other work, this one leaves me cold.  I am not certain why she felt compelled to dress as she did for the cover but like the CD she is trying too hard.
B007A6XLDU|1.0|Should have smelt a rat when I discovered I had to download & install Amazon App store and open my phone up to allow installation from non-preferred sources.<br /><br />Amazon app store was grindingly slow, even over a quick WiFi connection - heaven knows how dismal it would have been over GSM. User interface wasn't really optimised for phone.<br /><br />Installed SmartOffice 2 and had a quick whirl.<br /><br />Slow, grindingley slow.<br /><br />User interface seems to have concentrated on big colour \\"friendly\\" graphics, rather than usablity.<br /><br />Still, I could put up with that and went to remove the Amazon App (just didn't feel comfortable with that marketing funnel on my phone), after which Smart Office stopped working.<br /><br />Uninstalled.<br /><br />Just glad I'd had the chance to try under the Amazon free app offer and not paid for it.<br /><br />Probably won't bother trying anything else from Amazon App store if it means tying up with the marketing feed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was looking for books on meditation and somehow stumbled onto this title (huh?!) , It sounded interesting so I bought it not knowing what to expect and after finishing it I can't wait to get the authors other books! I was invested in the characters from the first chapter and it only got better from there. If you're looking for a roller coaster ride with twisted characters and an even more twisted plot give this one a try. This book makes 'Fatal Attraction' seem like a bedtime story.

B000J5XS3C|4.0|first off let me say I'm not an audio guy and really only bought this as a casual hobby, something to tinker with, that said it works as promised, my only grip with it is there is no power on/off button, that is unless i just missed it, but digging through all of the documentation as well as searching for one on the device yielded nothing. documentation wise, it's for people who know what they want, I'm a media guy so i was able to piece it together but that said, it does more than what i wanted it to do for a good price.

B0063FGG22|5.0|North by Northwest is, of course, a classic - some regard it as Hitchcock's best film. What really pleased me about this Blu-Ray version, however, was not so much the clean picture and clear sound, which I had expected, but the range and quality of extras included. As well as a biography of Hitch, there's an excellent hour and half feature on Cary Grant - a real bonus.
1476715904|5.0|Overall:  I completely expected not to like this book.  I delayed buying this book for a month even at the insistence of a few close friends.  It wasn't until I discovered this title on Netgalley that I gave it a shot.  Let me also say that I don't typically read contemporary novels - ah, but this is no ordinary contemporary novel.  If you've ever wanted the poster-novel for dark fiction, Slammed is it.  Layken has a pretty shitty life who can't catch a single break as the novel progresses.  Does she give up?  No, she learns to be strong and deal with whatever life throws at her.  Slammed is definitely a novel that will compel you to read in one sitting.  It will tug at every emotion you have in your body - even the tin man would weep during sections of this book.<br /><br />A key part of this novel is slamming, which is performed poetry.  I rarely read poetry and I have trouble understand poetry that is very metaphorical.  These poems performed by the characters either during poetry class or at Club N9NE are best if read out loud with extra emphasis on the bolded words.  I must say that this is the first book I have ever wished to purchase on audio.  Instead, after reading this book I immediately purchased a paperback and gifted it to my mom so she can enjoy it too.<br /><br />Characters:  There are no cheerleaders or nerds in this book, even though it's set primarily in the high school.  Layken isn't loved at first sight by every male in the vicinity - in fact, she's largely ignored by her classmates, except for a spunky girl named Eddie and her small group of friends.  Eddie has her own demons (she's a foster child) but it's hard to tell by her cheerful demeanor.  It's refreshing to have the two teenage girls survive an entire novel without fighting - can't think of another YA that does.  In fact, there are surprisingly few cliches used to define any of the characters.  I wasn't sure what the characters would do next or what tragedy would strike next, and I think that was a major factor in my liking this book.<br /><br />Plot:  It's hard to explain what happens in this book without giving away an early spoiler, which is why Will can't date Layden.  At the start of the book, Layken has moved with her mother and brother across the country to snowy Michigan.  Layken meets her neighbor, Will, and they hit it off immediately.  She goes on the best date of her life and thinks that life is starting to improve.  Not so.  When Layken starts her new school she (and I) was completely shocked to find out that she and Will have to end their relationship (for reasons I won't spoil).  Her life complicates further when her brother and Will's become best friends and she sees Will almost constantly.  Not sure what his true feelings are, Layken can't help but be depressed.  At the same time, her mother is becoming increasingly distant and has a secret of her own.  One that definitely is not good for Layken or her brother.<br /><br />Ending:  I liked how this novel ended, and yet after experiencing all the trauma Layken dealt with in Slammed, I'm not quite sold on finding out what life throws at her in the sequel.  I like her so much that I'd rather her not have to do this all over again in the second book.  She deserves better.  This ending is sad, depressing, but you can't help but smile because Layken is optimistic about her future.that was a major factor in my liking this book.<br /><br />Plot:  It's hard to explain what happens in this book without giving away an early spoiler, which is why Will can't date Layden.

B00004W5CQ|5.0|This album is just one of my favourites. I heard it first in 1978 when I was 12 and I was first fascinated by mr. Cobham's fast and powerful drumming and later on mr. Johnson's virtuoso and supergroovy playing. A great album.
B000X12QQ2|1.0|I also had a bad experience with MovieMars on my Odessey order made in July.  Sent me two copies of some old WWII Movie.  Sent those back and now in October I don't have the CD or a refund.  They won't even acknowledge my emails. You have been warned.<br /><br />I saw the Zombies this summer in Florida.  First half of the show was their new CD which was a little slow but the Second half was great with the Zombies doing their stuff with a great deal of energy.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Great DVD set for one of the best shows I've ever seen.  The chemistry between Castle and Becket is awesome.  I had to order a second set for my grandson who really enjoyed watching this show.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Loved watching her on TED and as a result bought the book and have a better grasp of who I am and how I work with others (or better yet, how I work best alone).
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've never been a fan of sleeping with the aid of sound machines but after trying this out I have to say I changed my mind. This app has a little something for everyone, including several different rain loops, the classics like &quot;white noise&quot; and &quot;ocean&quot; and ambient music options among others, all of which can be layered. You can even set each layer's volume individually. The favorites fuction saves any soundscapes you've created, right down to the volume setting. I haven't delved into the bi nueral beats yet but the options are there. theoretically the wave patterns should help you to dream while sleeping or even keep you concentrated whilest studying. All in all this app is well worth the price. I reccomend no other sound app higher that this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome this game keeps me entertained for hours. I wait on the notifications to tell me that something is going on on my village!  I love love love this game and all the challenges. its easy to understand and Manuver.....
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm trying to think of some of the bad aspects of this novel, but I can't!<br /><br />My favorite thing about Game of Thrones, and the writer's style in it (never read anything for him other than this) is how each chapter is in the point of view of a certain character. You actually FEEL like the character, whether it's a child and their random mostly never logical thoughts, to the the cunning and selfish thoughts of an adult. It gives you a different perspective of the same event or plot. The other part is the large number of parallel and intersecting sub-plots. You're never bored, and you just want to read more and more. Luckily the books are big enough to satisfy this need!<br /><br />The large number of characters and their struggles does not get overwhelming because of how the chapters are split, I think it runs smoothly and follows a general timeline.<br /><br />The book deserves a five because it's so interesting it has it all: fantasy, romance, politics, thriller, and even comedy! A definite must read!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is just like the fair! oddly addictive and very fun. just wish there were more coins to play longer!
B007THA4FI|3.0|So first of all when you set out to read this, and you're a Harry Potter fan, you need to realize this is NOT Harry Potter in any way. You could have read a hundred novels with adult language, but seeing a couple of swear words from JK Rowling will definitely be shocking at first! You must get over all this if you want to enjoy the book.<br /><br />The Bad: The story starts out with a spiral of characters and setups. It doesn't slow down either, you are bombarded with characters, their descriptions, and small stories of their past. What makes it difficult to keep up is that every couple of pages or so, you are moved to a totally different setup with a bunch of new characters. This could have been fine if it wasn't as frequent. It gets very confusing and you almost want to give up because you feel like you're at 30% and still don't have a clue who this is or what's going on. You mustn't!<br /><br />The Good: It's really amazing, and quite fun seeing how all this chaos gets sorted out and related to each other slowly towards the end. After you endured the first half, you really get along with the characters even though they're not very lovable but you start to understand them better and would really want to go on. I just liked how the plot was tangled and then brilliantly cleared out. The way every small event and action made sense in the overall shaping of each character and their decision becomes very clear, it all makes sense!<br /><br />Overall, I gave it 3 stars because it's not exactly annoying to read, but then again it's not the greatest there is out there either. It's worth a read, if you're willing to push yourself over the first half till you start rolling with it in the second half.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|One of the greatest stories I've ever read -- whether books aimed at children or adults.<br /><br />Jacob's grandfather, Abraham Portman, lived what seems to Jacob the exact opposite life to his own: Grandpa Abe was sent very young to an orphanage in Wales to escape the coming destruction of the Holocaust; all of Abe's family perished at the Nazis' hands. While there, Grandpa Abe had further adventures, and then went on to become a brave soldier, a distant father but a gifted ranconteur -- especially when recounting the tales of the other children -- the peculiar children -- at the orphanage, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The stories -- the unbelievable stories -- are each accompanied by an equally riveting black-and-white antique photo.<br /><br />In contrast, Jacob Portman now lives in a family that owns a chain of hundreds of drug stores. Jacob lives the life of the privileged 1 percent. No adventures for him. But the death of his grandfather launches a search for that long-ago orphanage and what became of those exceedingly peculiar children. And what was the danger that, after World War II, Abe Portman was still fleeing? In finding the truth of his grandfather's life, Jacob comes to realize that grandfather and grandson have more in common than young Jacob ever knew.<br /><br />Of course, the poignant photos and the tales that author Ransom Riggs crafted to accompany them constitute a good part of the appeal. However, even with the photos, I'd put this book against -- forgive the blasphemy! -- the Harry Potter series and the Chronicles of Narnia. The novel is filled with mystery, magic, suspense and even hope. You won't soon forget \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.\\" I only wish I could give it six stars.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is such an entertaining game - can't get enough - awesome on flights; makes time fly by! wish there was another similar game!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Thought provoking, engaging, and straight at the heart of the introvert; a must read for introverts and those who want to understand them better.
B008BR3Q0U|4.0|The vibe, flow, and feel of \\"The Magic Door\\" clearly links it to the first CRB recording, \\"Big Moon Ritual,\\" but this set seems a bit more borrowed (a couple of remade tracks and a cover could be why) in places. Still this band is brimming with energy and sometimes the songs really seem to just lift off and soar. The freaky magic of their vibe is infectious but not feverish, and even as the music gradually dissolves in Vibration & Light Suite it still pulls you along toward that secret magic door.<br /><br />I wish I could have seen CRB live during their recent southern swing as I think these songs would really be even more fun live. Play this one loud (as if you need prompting) and on a good stereo but full effect.
B0087HT36U|4.0|this is a fun game in the vein of angry birds. it needs to be optimized for kindle and other tabs. the delay is very frustrating when certain levels require quick action. would rate higher with bugs fixed.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Those of us paying hardcover book or even paperback book prices for ebooks should, in my opinion be able to share these books with at least one friend if not two or three as we would if we had the paperback or hardcover in our hands. Somebody is making a very good profit in e-books, a much better profit than they do with the paper books, either hardcover or paperback. It seems only fair that we get sharing rights as if we had the books in our hands and most certainly we should be allowed to share with the much larger profit somebody is certainly making on e-books.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i first played this game on my friends android. when i saw it for kindle fire i was like heeeck yeaa! lolx this game is rediculously addictive! it will have you sittong there waiting for your next coins to arrive!
B0098VXE50|5.0|Despite the bad reviews I have heard, I loved it.  I think this was a great representation of this fairytale.  I will probably watch it again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Really cool game. I haven't played this game in several years.....I love the new features. I was excited to see that it was offered on the kindle.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I am a big fan of The Good Wife and must say that I was very impressed with the 3rd season.  I really like owning the seasons as they come out - this one is my favorite - great design and special features.

0525953728|1.0|I was looking for a good write up but the first few chapters were boring. I seem to lose interest in the following chapters .
0062124293|1.0|I thought the book was funny at times but towards the end it gets pretty dark with her views on abortion and God and religion.  It's very offensive, she equates religion to a pastime as useless as jigsaw puzzles!! being Godless and thinking abortion is an easy choice doesn't define a feminist in my opinion.  Women who believe in something beyond the power of their female reproductive organs are much better role models to follow.

B0045D3N3O|5.0|'Malcolm X' is a classic. This is a sweeping adaptation of the book Malcolm X wrote with Alex Haley is one of the finest American bio pics ever, at once devastatingly tragic, angry and exhilarating. A blistering, deeply moving portrait of a great, complex man and a vivid recreation of time and place.<br /><br />It's Spike Lee's best film, beautiful to look at and powered by one of cinemas great performances. How did Denzel Washington NOT win Best actor for this? Plus no Best Picture, Director or other actor nods and Ernest Dickerson's outstanding cinematography didn't get nominated either - outrageous!! And it's a testament to Lee's fine script and direction that despite being 3+ hours long, 'Malcolm X' is never boring.<br /><br />Washington's brilliant acting is the heart of the movie, as he shows Malcolm driven by righteous anger, compassion and personal revelation. It's a dynamic, multifaceted performance. He's magnificently supported by great acting all round, Delroy Lindo as an early criminal boss, Angela Bassett as his wife, Albert Hall as his mentor and Al Freeman Jr as Nation of Islam leader, Elijah Mohammed are all sensational.<br /><br />Hindsight carping aside, this film deserves to be seen and looks fantastic on blu-ray.<br /><br />.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Sons of Anarchy Season Four was pre-ordered over a year ago.  I received notices all thru the year of the status of the order and when the DVD came available I was notified of the shipping date.  Amazon.com shipped and delivered as promised a brand  new DVD.  I have ordered several items from Amazon and have always been more than happy with each item.  I recommend this site 100%.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read! I enjoyed this book from beginning to end! Finished the book in 4 days while traveling. Highly recommend reading this.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Not very good work.  You may want to know that Amazon allows you to return a kindle book within 7 days.<br />At this price, if you don't like it you should take advantage of that.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|\\"Blood Song (Raven's Shadow Trilogy: Book I)\\" by Anthony Ryan is a wonderful, amazing, and magnificent fantasy/adventure story that will captivate and entertain you. The first words that come to mind when thinking about this epic novel are; wondrous, brilliantly written, enchanting, intense, magical, melifluous pacing, exquisitely atmospheric settings, elegant verbiage, richly developed characters, comradery, epic storyline, dystopian fantasy, a must read, and soon to be classic in this genre...5+stars!

B004MC0FO8|1.0|I downloaded it for my Kindle  Fire, but it didn't work. All in all if you have a Kindle Fire from before December 2011 there is a slim chance it will work.

0060751967|4.0|A really fun read. Story moves along quickly with great humor that is unexpected in a vampire novel. Recommended it to family members.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a chilling account of the raid on the Osama bin Ladin compound in Abbotabad.  It reads like a fictional thriller; I had to remind myself that this was not fiction but a true account.  I had never realized how extensive the training of a Navy SEAL was until I read No Easy Day.  It is nothing short of amazing at the test these brave men are willing to put their bodies through, knowing that the training is only the tip of the ice berg. I also enjoyed the description of the author and growing up in Alaska.  As Americans, we are privileged to have courageous men like Mark Owen, his friends, Charlie, Walt and so many many more individuals who are willing to risk their lives daily for our country.  I had to give this book five stars for the gripping story that was well written and informative while it kept me up late at night turning pages.  But also any reviewer would have to consider the strength of character, dedication to country and patriotism that must consume all of these fearless men who give so much.  May God be with them all.
B004I744AS|4.0|well it's good enough to have an idea about the meaning u look for<br />the interface is User friendly the long list of meaning of the words is quite good to know their various meaning
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I pretty much went on the high reviews this has received and I was not disappointed at all. The story is excellent and apart from the odd, overly long and embellished sentence, like this one, the writing was tight, fast-paced and thrilling to read. Hopefully the cover art will be slightly better if it gets into print but can't wait for the next instalment. I'd have used the word 'brother' there... but it's been done already I'm sure, so I'll just say, keep up the good work...
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Simply put this is the book for beginners. You could just follow a routine somebody plans for you or that you look up or you can read this book and understand exactly why somebody planned your workout and diet the way they did. Its simple and easy to understand. Everything is explained.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day does not disappoint!<br />I was reluctant to how Reflected in You would pick up...but it continues the day after Bared to You left off<br />Gideon & Eva are amazing<br />So many emotions were experienced while reading this book, could not put it down<br />Love, hate, frustration, jealousy, sympathy, and so forth<br />All of this in one book<br />I will not spoil any parts of the book<br />Loved how towards the end Eva takes charge and puts people in their place<br />She loves Gideon and it hurts to see Gideon so hurt & vulnerable<br />Now we have to wait a few more months for the last book in the series<br />I'm pretty sure Sylvia Day has something amazing planned out
B008G12EUY|5.0|So a big fan here of Muse.  Honestly they are my favorite band.  And after listening through \\"The 2nd Law\\" it is not my absolute favorite of their albums but it definitely stands apart-and in a good way.  Many people may dislike this album or the band for experimenting with new sounds and genres of Music most notably electronica in this album.  However, it shows diversity, creativity, and boldness in my opinion and I think it sets this album apart further than all the ones before it.  Top songs to listen to in my opinion: \\"Supremacy\\" \\"Madness\\" \\"Survival\\" \\"Follow Me\\" & \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\".  These five explore new musical themes whilst retaining Muse's iconic haunting strains.  They also hale to the band's interests and tradition of apocalyptic themes paired with the emotional struggles that come through such circumstances.  I am sure with many more listens to come this album will grow on me even more and I encourage anyone who is a fan of Muse to give it a true shot and anyone new to the band to dive in and experience the awesomeness for yourself!

B008FPZQRO|5.0|When TARKUS first came out, I had to listen to it twice to take at least parts of it in. Tarkus was and is a masterwork of ELP, as much or more than anything on the Works LP's or any of their other efforts. ELP took progressive rock to it's limits, largely due to the talent pool that made the band up. Tarkus takes elements of jazz, rock and classical and combines them with ELP's well known driving spirit, vocalizations and musicianship. To this day, I play this over and over and enjoy every part of it's complex musical genius.  It might be good to point out, that Emerson and Lake toured together last year (2011) , even in smaller venues and they used Tarkus as a centerpiece of the show, sort of wrapping 'Take A Pebble' around it. And they do play it to it's completion, which was magnificent to see and hear up close and personal. My personal favorite work from ELP's amazing catalog.

B0016BP0PW|5.0|Having experienced the sixties as a young adult, I am usually disappointed with movies about the era.  This movie, however, actually captures the feel of the time.  In addition, it showcases the Beatles's songs in a a new and refreshing way.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The whole system works perfectly, I love it.  Can't give it that 5th star, though, because of the syncing between devices.  Kindle will reliably go to the \\"farthest location read\\" between devices, but never make the mistake of looking something up in the book's index while reading the book - that becomes the \\"farthest location read\\" and the syncing won't make sense anymore.  Be nice if there was away to re-set the \\"farthest location read\\" after looking something up in the last pages of the book.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Stunning , Addictive , devastatingly perfect !

B0080BFWAE|4.0|Adventures in Babysitting is one of those movies that all of the kids back in the day saw apart from me. No particular reason, I just never got around to it. With the new Blu-ray I figured now would be right time to catch up on what I missed.<br /><br />It's not a John Hughes movie, but it does have a similar aesthetic and is set in a cold, snowy Chicago (a common Hughes theme), and it's the director debut of Chris Columbus who worked with Hughes on the first two Home Alone movies. Babysitting is quite similar in that is has a bunch of kids/teens getting into all kinds of hi-jinks while evading and outsmarting crooked grown-ups.<br /><br />Elizabeth Shue plays Chris Parker (no relation to Jennifer Parker from BTTF) a girl who has been stood-up by her sleazeball boyfriend and ends up babysitting for a wealthy couple while they go hob-nobbing in the city. Though content to sit in the house all night she gets a frantic call from her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who is trapped in an inner city bus station and needs rescued. Multiple detours and deviations make the rescue no easy task. I guess in this sense the movie feels a little bit like Planes, Trains and Automobiles.<br /><br />It's all inoffensive and good-natured, though I was surprised to hear a couple of F-bombs in there, and some of the dialogue is a little raunchy. Babysitting is no classic, but has lasting appeal and is a fun ride. Michael Kamen also provides a score which sounds like a Die Hard prototype, lending a little more weight to the adventure than would be typical. Stay watching until after the credits for an extra scene.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presents the movie in 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound, both are pretty good considering the age and budget limitations of the $7 million production. Disney have some nerve calling this a '25th Anniversary Edition' though, it contains absolutely no extras whatsoever apart from a couple of brief, upfront clips of Paranorman and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. There isn't even any disc art.There isn't even any disc art.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|After seeing the movie, Searching for Sugar Man, we ordered Rodriguez' cd's.  They are amazing. The cd's arrived on time from Amazon.  One was not as clear, so I returned it and was sent another one immediately.  I can't believe I never heard of Rodriguez before!

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The amazing graphics held up well even when on max zoom. I enjoyed the hidden objects and puzzles,  but all of the running back and forth, up and down became a little tedious. Even the hidden objects started to have a de javous quality. A fun way to pass the time when you are trapped with no way out! I have spent more on a soda... no complaints there.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is not my cup of tea. Would make a good (shallow) beach read. I almost put it down early on.

B006DICWUE|5.0|Long time Nada Surf fan and I LOVE this album. I know these guys can rock and thankfully, they cranked up the guitars and let loose a little bit on Stars. Not that I didn't like the previous couple of albums because they had their high points for sure, but Stars pushes it a little further I feel. I like that they used a second guitarist and there's some really nice guitar leads, which I like a lot and adds dimension to the band. Of course, these tunes will pump up their live shows as well.<br /><br />My faves are Clear Eye For The Clouded Mind, Moon Is Calling, When I Was Young, and No Snow On The Mountain. The whole album plays nicely start to finish.<br /><br />Nice work Nada Surf!

B009G8GRX6|3.0|I'm going to keep this review short (or try, anyway), seeing as so many others have written a novel on it. This album is very hit and miss for me, mostly miss. I'll tell you right now that if I fall in love with a band for its sound and it decides to go different places it usually doesn't work out well, in my opinion. Some bands can do it successfully, others not so much. This album isn't too successful in that right.<br /><br />There are a couple of really off the wall songs here. \\"Madness\\", \\"Panic Station\\", and \\"Survival\\" are low points for me. \\"Panic Station\\" sounds really derivative. It's interesting, at least, but not really a song that makes me want to listen to it again. I really like the chorus of \\"Big Freeze\\" as it reminds of older Muse, although certain verses aren't the greatest. I'm not a fan of dubstep, so I didn't find the influences in a few songs too appealing. I'm just glad it's not all over the whole album.<br /><br />Overall, the album is just okay. If you're a huge fan of the earlier stuff and want to hear more of that, there's very little here. I love Bellamy's innovative riffs, but much of that is absent on this album. If you want to hear Muse do something different, this might be for you. If you're just getting into Muse, I suggest listening to the their albums in succession from the 1st on. Muse's previous albums are quite incredible (Origin of Symmetry possibly being my favorite).
1451662432|3.0|Schwarzenegger's new book isn't as bad as it could be. This is a decent autobiography, with plenty of memories and anecdotes. Like Arnold himself, the book is warm but so guarded I can't help but wonder what he's leaving out. This is not a racy tell-all. It is a not-bad account of an ambitious (but not remotely self-aware) man who has done a a fair amount of interesting things.<br /><br />Arnold's most candid memories come early in the book, with his accounts of childhood in Austria during the early days of the Cold War. He tells of snuggling with his brother and parents in bed during thunderstorms, of their house with no toilet, of being beaten by parents and teachers alike. There is insight into his father's bitterness and the futility of surviving in a country trying to find its footing in the wake of the Third Reich. From a young age, Arnold saw America as a beacon of strength and safety, and bodybuilding as the path to lead him there. He boldly recalls being \\"absolutely certain\\" he was special.  From a young age, Schwarzenegger was shameless in going after what he wanted: he panhandled money to go to the toy store and movies, went AWOL from the military for a bodybuilding contest, and picked fights for thrills. His concern seems first and foremost about getting caught, and even in hindsight he seems unconcerned as to what this all might say about his character. He unblinkingly describes steroids and women (\\"one of my girlfriends was a stripper and the other was a gypsy.\\") But he's also sure to mention his gratitude for the parental figures who nurtured him along the way.<br /><br />In America, Arnold's cunning and determination bring success at bodybuilding, promotion, and various entrepreneurial endeavors. Some readers will think these parts are funny, like when he learned to lie about his zodiac signs to pick up girls and outwitted a competitor in a bodybuilding competition by working the crowd.  When he gets into film and politics, the story becomes more scripted. He's a Republican because he sees this as the embodiment of the American Dream and views Democrats as \\"too Austrian.\\"  He can be genuinely egalitarian -- like openly promoting women in bodybuilding -- but also totally doesn't get it, like his approach to filming a violent scene with a woman. There are lots of conversations with Sargent Shriver and George H.W. Bush (who, he'll have us know, was NOT a \\"waschlappen\\" - the Austrian word for \\"wet dishrag.\\") He describes mentors including Milton and Rose Friedman, James Earl Jones, Marvin Hier, and Andy Warhol. I'm not a film buff but I was interested in all the moviemaking, especially his work with James Cameron on the Terminator films.  He might be at his best with inadvertent observations, like an overheard argument about race between Wilt Chamberlain and Grace Jones. For political fans, the section on his campaign and work as Governor of California are as straightforward as a press release but include a fair amount of detail about the political process. To his credit, he does try to explain why his policies, which can seem inconsistent, align with his goals and ideals.<br /><br />Of course, the object of his affection is Maria Shriver: the savvy, beautiful, energetic woman whose world was \\"big enough\\" for him even as she brought him a much-needed dose of common sense. He has only nice things to say about Maria (this also keeps him from being more candid about the Kennedy Family, which is our loss).  He compares their marriage to Joe and Rose Kennedy. He recounts all the details of his marriage proposal (at his childhood swimming hole in Austria). His affection gets so heavy-handed it sounds desperate (when their first baby was born, the \\"nurse showed us how to breastfeed\\" . . . . and: \\"of course I was in heaven when Eunice or Sarge would come stay with us.\\") He adores Maria, but he also adores cars, and it's hard not to notice that he describes his first customized Humvee with the same gushing voice he uses forhis wife.  Although, in fairness, his tenderness toward his young children is undeniable.<br /><br />So we have to assume that this book is intended as some kind of public love letter to beg her forgiveness and try to win her back.  When I found myself wondering why Shriver filed for divorce instead of trying to work it out, I realized I couldn't possibly know the whole story - perhaps I had been charmed myself, because he's obviously left out so much. I wouldn't be surprised if even Arnold doesn't understand. I suspect his downfall in marriage had a lot to do with his failure to understand his own carelessness -- what in the Austrian military he called being \\"catastrophe-prone\\" -- his ultimate lack of humility, his concern with getting caught instead of doing the right thing.<br /><br />In the end, the book does have some unwitting insights, although most of them are between the lines. Fans of Schwarzenegger's politics or films will find a lot here to entertain them. For me it was mildly interesting, but in the end this is not a person -- or a book -- I need in my life after I finish the final page.
B005ZUR724|5.0|wonderful game definitely five stars. and worth the money for sure. with nothing bad to say about it on my review.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|This movie has been a favorite in my family for years, and just thought I'd like to own a copy for myself.  I'm glad I purchased it.  I've always loved the message of this movie. It's great for anyone of any age. I would recommend it to everyone.  But then, who hasn't seen it??? :)

B0084IG7KC|5.0|First of all, Jennifer Lawrence (Winter's Bone) was the perfect choice to put Katniss Everdeen on the screen.  Josh Hutcherson (The Bridge to Tarabithia), was also an excellent choice as Peeta Mellark.  The film does what a good adaptation to a novel does: re-interpret it as needed to the much different medium.  The book (I have read all three) is first-person narrative, so we always know what is going on in Katniss' head.  Obviously that cannot be transferred to the screen other than by the actor's expressions and words.  And that is done immaculately by Ms. Lawrence.  Lawrence's background has been in the indies, the form she prefers she says, but showed her acting chops in a big Hollywood movie as well.  My suggestion to those who have read the book(s): watch it as a movie, not looking out for things left out or added in.  Suzanne Collins gave the screenwriter and director, Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Big, as screenwriter) wide latitude in creating the vision.  Ross obviously succeeded.  Watching it now on DVD made me love it even more than when I saw it at the cinema.  For all of those who are hesitant to see a movie of, basically, children killing children, please know that it is not shot gruesomely (with one exception), emphasizing this type of violence.  The fight scenes at the cornucopia are handled in a way that it almost seems like a blurr, for instance.  Also, it is clear that this is not to glorify violence as in an action thriller, but to show the calumnity and viciousness of the Capitol and its President, played chillingly by the great Donald Sutherland (Kiefer's dad for you under 30).  Highly recommended (not that my recommend matters!)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Even better than the first, the second Crossfire novel had me tied up in knots.  The emotion poured out of this book & had me feeling like I was Eva.  Emotionally drained after spending 3 solid hours reading, my body was on fire after finishing the book.  I felt like I could cry, throw up, smile, or throw myself off of a cliff, all at the same time.  It's not often that a book makes me truly feel like Reflected In You did.  You can just tell that Ms. Day put her heart and soul into writing this book.  I can't wait for the final chapter....
B0086DBE62|5.0|My wife and I both enjoyed this movie... made us laugh and did not take a lot of thinking. For light entertainment, this one fits the bill.
B003QS9WIE|3.0|This was a good movie, not great. I felt the end twist came a bit out if the blue. The acting was excellent and the magic effects  interesting.  Worth sewing.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I felt the book was not keeping me spellbound like some of the books I read, like the \\"Gray\\" series.  I must admit I wanted to see how it ended, but even that was a dissappointment.  I felt the girl needed to be punished for all the awful things she did.  I guess I like a happy ending and this one left me thinking \\"duh\\".  Everyone got skrewed!!!!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Thought provoking, and rich with witty humor The Fault in Our Stars is so far my favorite read of the year. The characters were dynamic and colorful, while not being overwritten and almost over-the-top as some authors have become.
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|A sequel to Phantom of the Opera may have been an impossible task.  This was certainly a disappointment.  Raoul has certainly gone downhill fast.  Also, it appears that the Phantom did a bit more to Christine then just sing to her.  You'd think that she might have figured out he was a man and not an angel a bit faster in the original.  In any event, except for \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" the music wasn't all that good, and I liked neither the plot nor the ending.  The author of the book is certainly rolling over in his grave.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I loved this game until it did an update ... now it is the pits.  my stylus will not select the tiles,  sometimes I can not even select with my finger.... game time increases with each game.  very frustrating to play now.  looking for new game.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|I really liked this book.  I loved the Passage by Justin Cronin, and this reminded me a bit of that book.  It was written in an interview format it so was disturbingly realistic.  What was an unexpected bonus was how much I learned while reading the book, and not about Zombies.  So many historical references sent me to Google to look them up; an example is the segment that dealt with a siege of a castle.  The character being interviewed mentioned many actual castles and I had to look each one up.  Very fun and interesting reading.  Think I will have to read the precursor The Zombie Survival Guide.  And the most surprising thing? The author OS Max Brooks, Mel Brooks' son!
B008N1V11U|1.0|first of all the beginning of the game is awesome. then you get put in glitch city because of the rain then after that you get put in a military base and get shot up before you can even put your fingers on the pad. Thank God, I got this app for .25&cent; and no I did not steal or hack the game, gameloft did it for 1 day and I got lucky.<br />  Thank You
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Mind you, I still think Superman the Movie is the best, but mainly due to it's groundbreaking nature.<br /><br />The Avengers doesn't try to be groundbreaking, it's pure entertainment at it's best. Great acting, great action, and great humor.<br /><br />Full of great lines that will be endlessly quoted.<br /><br />There are several versions. I got the simple DVD with the film only (very inexpensive), since I figure there will be a \\"Platinum Edition\\" out in a year or two with even more extras.

B001HN6922|3.0|Now, sure, I really like Cars, but oddly the \\"cars' part bothered me. What I loved was the fabulous scenery and the nice references to the Route 66 of my childhood.<br /><br />This is a Spy Movie- either a homage or a parody, take your pick. But with all the parts (heh) being played by cars (and trucks, etc).<br /><br />Full of humor aimed at young boys, it also has quite a few little jokes aimed at a more adult crowd, especially car buffs.<br /><br />This is aimed straight at the little boy market who isn't all that interested in \\"princesses\\". It hits that market dead on, but it can be enjoyed by the whole family.
B0058YPL66|4.0|This series is very imaginative and entertaining.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy. I plan to purchase the second season when it comes out.  My brother recommended it to me and he was anxious for the second season to begin.

B008N5UX9M|3.0|I love Steve Harris and having been a fan for over twenty years and loved iron maiden albums, it was pretty surprising how poor the production quality is.  The tunes are cool!...I like the songs a lot, but the production would have been better with a boom box in a basement!  Surprised Sir Steve let it out that way!..<br />Cool new music...it just sounds pretty weak because of the poor production.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This Schrade Extreme Survival knife is what it says it IS: Full length steel blade and the cutting edge shaves out of the box. I have always thought that a prepared trekker should have a pocket knife, a mid-size sheath knife and a heavy blade to obviate a machete or hatchet. The Extreme is that \\"heavy\\" that hangs inside or outside of the pack. The handle gives a good grip. Blade design permits a close grip ahead of the handle when needed. Lanyard hole allows a leather thong.<br />The sheath is adequate and can be used to make a pattern when this one wears out -the plastic insert will give a reasonable life. The sheath pouch has many uses on and off the sheath.  I'm anxious to use it. Importantly this fine knife is less that $40. Will it rival my Trail Master?  Next year will tell.  Thanks, Amazon, for another good product.  Robert

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never read any book as quickly as these.  I was so engrossed in it that I could not put it down.  The author has a way of writing that absolutely bringing you into the book.  Love her writings, but I need more books from her with this kind of content.
B000RO0ONW|5.0|The game came brand new, in original packaging. The game came with an unused disk, manual and spotless case. The quality of this purchase was above expectations. The only issue I found were just programming issues that were in the manufacturing of the game (Very large amount of lag during the \\"Water Hazard\\" chapter of Half Life 2, the game lacks better brightness settings and some of the voices sound higher) but besides those, the game runs great. Also, the game was shipped in an amazingly fast amount of time. Overall I am impressed with this purchase.

145162445X|5.0|Dear Amazonians: I felt a little overwhelmed by the names of the different reviews and opinions that this book engendered and that Amazon put in the site. And that's why I'm not going to talk about science (the book), but about being inspired (by the reading).<br /><br />To begin with: when I saw those names I said to myself I'm part of a majority which is also ―from another perspective― a minority. Good hint for introducing the whole point of \\"A universe from nothing,\\" a book that siege you with abundant and coherent data and analysis. And this is because when you ask yourself where, in what point a minority begins to being a majority, you have the problem of something and nothing just in front of you.<br /><br />The thing is that nothing to us is always something for the cosmos. Not for us but for the cosmos. That's why Lawrence Krauss includes a quote by Jacob Bronowski at the beginning that says that our experience of being alive is not a problem for taking sides, instead is a problem we have to assume. This means, just as it is.<br /><br />Perhaps you think you lose your time when the problem is the existence of God or the gods. My advice: read the book anyway. Here you don't have to take a side because in this book you are invited to discover how deep science has dug in the cosmos. So this is not about believing, not at all, but about living without stop being you.<br /><br />The cosmos gives you this and is free: you can observe it and wonder without paying a bribe. Think: why if the Moon is round, and the Sun is round, ancient people should have thought that the Earth was flat. Why our place had to be different? Then here we are, entered the Renaissance and the Illustration. And we knew --I mean the common people-- for the very first time that the Earth was round just like the rest of the planets. Nothing special.<br /><br />But wait, if the stars live and die, and the planets with them, and there were also planets that didn't succeed as such and were just rocks and stones disseminated and submitted to the gravitational field of a massive body, then why we were going to live eternally, defeat death and decomposition? We are makeup of star dust! Please listen the inspiring voice of Krauss: \\"Moreover, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than did those in your right.\\" Stars live and die guys, also we.<br /><br />Now I must say I cannot forgive an author that bores me. Krauss never did, despite the fact that some chapters (mainly chapter eight) were more difficult to grasp than others. In those cases you have to re-read or just wait for the following example or commentary that the author adds. In this sense, Krauss is always coming and going in order to keep you with him up to the end of the book.<br /><br />And in the end of the book you find Bronowski again closing the whole circle and Richard Dawkins, the latter in a very inspiring afterword.<br /><br />So after reading you'll be able to build beautiful metaphors or puns with \\"nothing\\" and \\"something.\\" But not just loose metaphors but some that are based on scientific knowledge which means --other things being equal-- speculation under control. Guys, I have read Plato, Aristotle, Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, and I tell you: don't miss the reading of this book. Let those out, take this one. You can do it in your room while rains outside or in a bus. One way or the other, you won't stop thinking that finally we know a little bit more about something and how it pops up from the very nothing.st rocks and stones disseminated and submitted to the gravitational field of a massive body, then why we were going to live eternally, defeat death and decomposition?

B003XT603Q|5.0|This is an amazing account of differing philosophies of life expressed by characters becoming adults in 1969 Japan.  The narrator is in love with a girl who is unable to return his feelings.  Another character loves her boyfriend more than he is able to love her, but she is willing to settle for that.  At the heart of the story, a vivacious character with clear vision tempers the conflicts within the narrator.  Separately, each character represents a philosophy that is familiar, either through experience or reading.  As a whole, the plot is slowed somewhat by the narrator's lack of action, but that allows the other characters to reveal themselves more completely.

0380977273|4.0|This was my first experience with Bradbury and I had to ask myself several times, \\"Why haven't I read any of his work before?\\" Bradbury has a wonderful style to his prose and his use of language really makes the reader pause and relish what has just been read before moving on for more.<br /><br />Several other reviews and comments have labeled this book as a book for teens or slapped it with the dreaded \\"Young Adult\\" label. While I do find this novel to be very appropriate for a younger audience. I also think that whether or not you read it at a younger age, it is a novel that will be more appreciated by those of a more ripened age. To me, a younger audience will be more drawn to the plight of the main characters whereas someone such as myself will identify and better understand the position and emotional makeup of Will's father, Mr. Halloway.<br /><br />The story itself is a wonderful coming of age type of adventure with plenty of tension and horrific moments that keep the reader on the edge of their seat. While the book is not so long as to be intimidating to more inexperienced readers, I found that it was anything but a quick read. That is not to say that I struggled to get through it, as a matter of fact, that couldn't be further from the truth. I found this novel to be one that I had to savor in smaller bites, taking a moment from time to time to sit back a reflect on the language and description provided by the author rather than rushing on to the next moment with our young heroes.<br /><br />All in all and enjoyable tale for both young and old that I will be sure to pick up again.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this on the advice of a friend who just loved it.  I'm not impressed.  I found it to be similar to the Harlequin style romances I read as a teenager, only with a generous dash of dominant/submissive sex thrown in.  I found that part particularly disturbing for the degrading effect on the girl in the story, but that was pretty well skimmed over.  The plot was predictable; of COURSE he is gorgeous, of COURSE he is rich, of COURSE she's a virgin, of COURSE they just can't stay apart from each other even though they both know they should, of COURSE he is torn, and mysterious and she just can't understand him, and of COURSE the sex is mind blowing....All that's missing is \\"heaving bosoms\\" and \\"burning loins\\"!<br /><br />To be fair, I don't generally read romance novels anymore.  However, it seems that everywhere I turn this book comes up in conversation. I kept asking myself, especially during the twisted sex games that have been made to seem desirable, \\"HOW did this become a best seller?!\\"<br /><br />That being said, sex sells.  Right?  I mean, I bought it!<br /><br />Doubt I'll spring for the last two, though.

When Christian meets her things for him change on so many levels with his life style and how he treats women. Ana finds herself in a relationship she isn't sure she wants but know she wants the man. It is funny, hot, and a little fifty shades of fxxxed up.<br /><br />I hope she finishes Christians POV that she gave up a little peek into. I would love to have more of Fifty.....
B00992CF6W|5.0|I do think its weird that there are elements of beta 1.8 but not early alpha, but for 7 bucks its great.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A must read for everyone to know what it takes to make us safe.  This book USA tribute to that
0345803485|2.0|First of all, I would like to say that this book is not well written. The author uses an occasional SAT vocab word here and there, but that doesn't make it a great work of literature.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the characters. Ana is clumsy, never been in love, insecure blah blah blah. Sound familiar? Bella from twilight comes to mind. My question is why would you make the same character up twice? It's ridiculous. It goes to show how much thought went into the process.  Even Christian Grey is similar to Edward Cullen. Both are described as good looking guys, but of course Christian Grey went a step further. He is fighting for world hunger. Wow..... Now, I will say that I have read all the twilight books and I love them to death, but the reason I don't like this book as much is because of weird sex crap. That's when it turned into Jersey Shore. You know Jersey Shore is so bad that it is actually quite good. We are able to laugh at the stupid and uncivilized people of our society. I think for many people this book will be the same. You will be afraid to admit that you actually might have enjoyed all the weird sex crap.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, the weird sex crap just didn't do it for me. I prefer the twilight books. I think it's really cute how much Edward cares for Bella and all the little things he does for her.<br /><br />Yes, this book fails as a twilight remake.
B000FC10MU|5.0|I really savored this book, knowing that it would be hard to find something comparable. Boy was I right.. I *still* haven't found something that was as great a story, so deep, and well-written.<br />This was my first venture into science fiction, and a good one to start with, I think. I've since read most of Neil Gaiman's books, and am hungry for more.<br />Once you finish this book, you'll want to read it over again...I think it's one of those books that you take something new away everytime you read it. It's just that deep and thought provoking.<br />I tend to be frugal, and hesitated at spending the money, but am very glad I did. I think you will be, too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i just want to see if i get a prize fir fiving five stars i better but the game is ok i play it a lot
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book!  I would definitely recommend all three. Need to read book one to fully appreciate the story. I was apprehensive at first but decided to get book one.  It is easy to  lose yourself in the characters and try and imagine what that life must have been like for Christian.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I lost interest midway, could have combined book 2 and 3 in one. Ana Steel seems immature to me. Very similar to the twilight series expect with more sex.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|This DVD is amazing for the ultimate Foo fan! It contains footage from Dave's time in Nirvana up to the recording of Wasting Light in Dave's garage. Individual personal interviews show a lot of emotion and the many highs and lows the band has been through. I highly recommend it to any music lover-not just Foo fans.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Ok Lets get this straight, my expectations were really high because not only this being a Nolan film but also because of this is sequel to the Dark Knight, which in my opinion is one of the best movies of all time. As far as Superhero movies go Dark Knight is still #1 but this Dark Knight Rises is only slightly behind...Avengers was great..but when you compare the two..everything in Avengers looked childish compare to the Rises..and Avengers in my mind a distant third.  What Nolan did with Batman is just remarkable..its amazing how dead Batman was in the late 90's and how Batman rose because of these three movies...I thought LOTR were the best trilogy of all time..but this trilogy is the best..the acting in all of three was top notch..even though Heath Ledger outperformed Christian Bale (and everybody)..Bale shows just how great of an actor he is in this one..JGL & Anne Hathaway were surprisingly good in their roles..so was Tom Hardy as Bane...at times I felt this movie is not about Batman but battered Bruce Wayne..which was a good thing. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman & Morgan Freeman were great as usual...all and all..just an Amazing movie.. as you can expect from Nolan & co. and great ending to Bruce Wayne saga..
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a great app. Works flawlessly on my Xperia Play, and also on the Motorola DROID 3. I love that I can crop, edit, or add filters to my photos. A feature I don't use, but love that it's available to me, are the borders and text options.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This white controller is, in my opinion, the best controller to have if you play super smash brothers melee for the Nintendo gamecube.  The controller is very durable (will last for a long time through button mashing), stylish, and you can perform all the technical skills such as L-Cancelling and wavedashing with it.  Anyone who is looking to replace their nintendo gamecube controller to play Melee, i strongly recommend getting this one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|highly addictive and simple game... glad the kindle fire finally got this...been playing on android, but so much easier on kindle fire
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked it. At the beginning of the story, there is no way of knowing what was going to happen. I couldn't put the book down in anticipation of what happens next.
0525953728|5.0|Wow! Absolutely loved it. Would like to shake the hands and buy a round for all of the SEALs and pilots/crew involved with this mission. Teams, thanks for all you do.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great insight on what happened that's day. I couldn't put the book down. The author really shows you what they had to go through to bring them to that moment and what they were thinking as it happened. I recommend everyone should read it.
0525953728|5.0|Great Book !!  It's like you were there with them.  I'm an Retired Air Force Special Ops guy.  I can really related to this mission and some of the things they were doing.  Great Book!!

0316228532|5.0|The reviews already tallied here have reiterated, ad nauseum, how unlike Harry Potter The Casual Vacancy is so I won't bother saying it.  What I will say is that by reading this new work, a reader of Harry Potter can see just how brilliant a writer for young adults Rowling is.  The language in The Casual Vacancy is lovely.  It is meaty, something you can properly sink your teeth into and savor slowly.  The lightness of touch she had in the Potter series is now clear, having tasted her adult fiction.  It makes the Potter series that much more brilliant in my eyes.  And it makes The Casual Vacancy that much more astounding; it is brave to venture so far from something so comfortable as a writing style one has practiced for years.<br /><br />The story unfolds slowly, thin layers of small happenings that in the end add up to a bigger picture.  The characters are immensely flawed and not corrected, fixed, made happy and perfect and all tied up with a perfect little bow.  It is unflinchingly real and unapologetically frank.  The \\"narrator\\" never judges only reports on the various weakness and small victories of the novel's subjects.  (The characters judge each other plenty and always through the fractured lens of their own prejudices and neuroses.)  Rowling leaves the readers to decide who the heroes and villains are.  Much like in real life, you find that in each character there is a bit of both.<br /><br />While I don't think it is a perfect book, I do believe Rowling is being judged unfairly by those who cannot approach The Casual Vacancy with fresh eyes.  I also believe, perhaps snobbishly, that some reviewers suffer from not having so much experience with books that lean to the literary end of the spectrum, those that focus more on exploring the minutiae of life and rely less on pulse-pounding plot.<br /><br />I can't say that the plot developments were all that unpredictable, but I wasn't disappointed with that.  It wasn't the point.  To tuck myself into this new world of Rowling's imagination and explore the often sad, sometimes tragic lives she creates leaves me with some small new shred of enlightenment on our fragile, tenuous, complicated human condition.  That is all I ask of any novel--whether written by a world-famous billionaire author or not.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this series and I believe Fifty Shades Darker is my favorite!  I can't get enough of Christian Grey!!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I am sitting here having just finished this book, reviewing my feelings and what I should say, when it hits me. My feelings?  Wow-isn't that what a good book does? It grabs you, it makes you laugh, smile, cry. This book was thought provoking and dug so deep with emotion and character development I know it will sit with me in my mind for days.  I also know I will re-read this book again and again.<br /><br />I have to say I was kind of anxious for this book and very scared that it wouldn't meet my expectations. I've been let down by other books, but I have to say I'm still a little awed by how well crafted this story was. Gideon and Eva felt very real to me, I shared their struggles, the guilt, the highs, the screwed up self-esteem issues, it really was amazing.  Plus, the plot was strong.  Wow - I didn't see a lot of it coming, oh sure I'd guessed who the bad guy was anyone who read Bared To You probably saw it coming, but the way Sylvia Day wrote it was brilliant. The bad guys was huge, but also a non-factor - it wasn't in your face, no Gideon/Eva were and that was awesome.<br /><br />Great read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|So far i am enjoying this game. When i run out of coins i just play another game. Keeps me from spending real money.
B007S3S8HO|2.0|My son is pretty Angry Birds-crazy, so he has absolutely had fun with this set. However, a few things keep this from being a highly-recommendable item:<br /><br />1. As much as the digital Angry Birds game claims \\"Real-World Physics,\\" Real-World Physics and K'Nex construction pieces do not always go together. So, do not expect the same collapsing fun that you see on the screen. If you click the pieces together too well, nothing falls.<br /><br />2. K'Nex pieces, in general, either fit too snugly or not enough. It depends on the piece, but some of these went together and said \\"I'll never let go!\\" while others were like oil and water: we'll sit by each other, but never be together. If that helped the construction to fly to pieces with bird impact or was consistent, I'd say it was a design feature. Doesn't seem to be. Feels more like construction variances.<br /><br />3. Price: I won't give the exact price in the review, because it fluctuates, but take a hard look at it. Of all the building toys out there, do you want to spend that much for something that is really just locked in as an Angry Birds promo item?<br /><br />In all, it's fun and if you're an Angry Birds addict, you might like it. I'm just not impressed with it.<br /><br />Star breakdown:<br /><br />4 stars of fun: since the end-goal is destruction and destruction is fun when contained to things that ought to be destroyed, it's quite fun.<br /><br />2 stars of educational value: not much to learn here that you can't learn from other things, but practice in artillery is a little educational. Force=mass*acceleration, right? Or \\"Light bird flung hard hits hard, but not as hard as golf ball flung hard.\\"<br /><br />3 stars of durability: you're building and tearing up. If this was made of titanium, it would be durable, but I expect no more than a year out of most of it, and less from the slingshot.
0316228532|5.0|This book is no Harry Potter, but who said it would be? If you go in expecting a masterpiece (not only with this book but with most things in general) then you will most likely be disappointed. Just start it with an open mind and be prepared to enter a world full of entertaining (if not morally detestable) people. It's a funny read.
185984054X|5.0|Hitchins expertly chips away at the legend to expose the catholic church's lies in lionizing a woman who deserved it least. The church wanted a hero and using myths and lies elevated a self serving woman to the level of potential saint in the eyes of millions. Hypocrisy, dishonesty, and downright theft are revealed in this book as well as toadying to some of the most evil people in the world, ostensibly to help the poor, but actually to spread the influence of her order around the world.
0316228532|1.0|This is the worst book I have attempted to read in a long time. I say attempted because I am having trouble getting through the the first half. It is dull, boring, dark, and pessimistic. Not my kind of read. I will perservere because once I start something I usually finish it. I am so disappointed because I loved the Harry Potter books. I guess I expected more from this author.  Maybe I am not English enough to understand what is going on in the book. I cannot perservere - this book is so bad - I finally deleted it from my Kindle.  I really did try to read it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Could not put it down.  This is the best Mitch Albom book I have read and I read them all.  Highly recommend reading.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|I loved it. Quirky, just enough off kilter to be hilarious. Only the really bad guys bite the dust and the rest muddle through according to some kind of lop-sided logic. Who knew how the world of politics really works! I've told all my friends to read it, and I actually went out and bought a paper copy to give to one who doesn't have a tablet.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love these games. This is by far one of the coolest adventure games I've played in a while. I cant wait to get farther in so I can see the new challenges.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's fun and we don't waste money. I like the simplicity of this game. I like having the puzzles on here as well.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|This was a very good way of looking at a old fairy tale. With today's Movie effects was pretty good.
B003Z0D4SM|4.0|I enjoyed the book but I found it slow at the beginning.  I like Lizbeth and looking forward to reading about her again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a phenomenal indie author!  I found myself reading into the night, and this afternoon played hooky from my own writing, compelled yet increasingly reluctant to get to the end of this book. Fascinating take on society.  If 'we the people' are given the truth about our lives, will we then fall into chaos and anarchy, or revel in the power of a democratic voice?  Read on, fellow readers...  And, Hugh?  Write on, please!
1423140605|5.0|Understand your enthusiasm to have read the book all you Big Richards but can you contain your mental boner to not reveal spoilers on here? Much appreciated.<br />To all others, absolutely worth the hype and a great read.

B00021HBGS|2.0|It is so difficult finding interesting bath tub toys.  So when I discovered this, I jumped at the opportunity to buy it.  However, at 2.5 years of age, my son is a little too young to \\"get\\" the toy.  He did begin to chew a few pieces and ruined them.  Once he discovered chewing them, I was having a hard time gathering all the pieces before he was putting them in hi moutn.  This toy may end up actually being \\"ok\\" in a year,so, this really isn't a complete review.  For now, the toy is put away until he is a little older.. .
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love it!  Save the trip to the arcade and play a favorite. Takes me back to the old days.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I thought the book was a great read; very thought provoking. It made me question and think about my beliefs.  It put in very simple terms that in order to be happy, we should be satisfied with what we have, and maybe even more important to be grateful for what we have.  It was also a very quick read, which I really enjoyed.

B006O5YI7G|5.0|Picking up the thread of true accounts that Butch Cassidy wrote to his sister after he \\"died\\" in South America, Sam Shepard has created a timeless classic. From the opening shots to the enigmatic conclusion the cinematography and the tightly drawn characters conspire to take the viewer on a  mysterious journey deep into the brutal and majestic interior of South America. Shepard has drawn Cassidy tightly and inhabits the character with more authenticity than Neuman could have achieved at the time with his treatment of the early  Cassidy/Sundance saga. The supporting cast is stellar and the plot has twists and turns that keep you guessing right through the ending. This is one of my all time favorite movies, authentic down to minute details, compelling and memorable. A must see/must own.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I told my students today - angry birds for angry people!  Very fun game, and horribly time consuming in all honesty
B008673ZAQ|4.0|OMG.... I couldn't put this book down. My emotions were all over the place. I really had a love/hate relationship with Gideon in this book. Without spoiling anything, Eva finally gets some answers on Gideon's past and all the while,Eva's past come back and then some. Emotional are broken, relationships are formed and yet it wasn't enought and it still left me wanting more. The characters in these books are HOT and the love/sex scenes....SMOKIN!!! I look forward to reading the next installment Entwined with You, to see where people and relationships end up! I also hope for a release date to be sooner rather than later!
1451662432|5.0|A friend of mine once said, \\"Success breeds contempt.\\" It seems obvious with the people who rate this book low without even reading it all. I find this book inspiring, informative, revealing, and instructional. Arnold tells the whole story -- warts and all -- and best of all are the success principles on how he trains relentlessly, how he writes goals on index cards that are specific, clear and measurable -- and so much more. I already bought copies for friends, and I have a hardcover copy AND the Kindle edition to read wherever I'm at. At 600 pages, I don't see how anyone can read it in one night. As with most in-depth autobiographies of successful people, there is much to learn. Heck, I even gained acting lessons from the book, as well as training tips for in the gym. Again, I LOVE this book. Well done, Arnold. (And no, I don't know him and this isn't a favor to him.)
B0083GOPSG|3.0|I enjoyed the plot of the movie for the most part, but way it was filmed drove me nuts. It's like the way Cloverfield was filmed. Overall it was worth the watch, and but if I would have seen it in theaters I would of been disappointed.

0002247399|4.0|In comparison to other fantasy books this one stands above so much that it, of course, deserves maximum rating. ASOIAF deserves the hype and this book is really, really good. However, I want to compare it rather to the previous ASOIAF books, especially to the first 3 which are some of the most brilliant, best written and most captivating fantasy books I had pleasure to read.<br /><br />This one, however, is  not easy to rate.<br /><br />My overall problem with A Dance With Dragons is that it could have been a SO MUCH BETTER book. It's definitely better than A Feast for Crows. It has more PoVs I care about. There are parts which may not be very interesting at first, but after re-reading you find them actually very well crafted, very interesting indeed ( a little bit like the Ironmen from previous volumes, which I've dismissed at first as boring and now I really enjoy reading). But! There are so many parts when the story just drags for the sake of not sure what - word-count ?<br /><br />I couldn't stand Quentyn's POV. It was completely pointless to drag us along him all this way. You can't help but wonder what the hell was it all about...? World building? I didn't enjoy the Danny bits at all. Tyrion is - literally - repeating himself, so is Jon.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem is that after reading 422k words you have this uneasy feeling that nothing truly epic actually happened. The plot just didn't move by an inch for most of the characters. When you compare it to the first three books and the premise of the epic things that are going to happen, you realize that you could actually skip this (and previous) volume and read a short summary instead:  Tyrion is here. Jon is here.  Quentyn - you know, Quentyn? Yeah, this guy - is there. Danny is (still) here. Ironmen are there, in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />Now we want to see all those people doing some of the epic stuff that was promised...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book just as much a the first in the series.  It is always moving.  Never a dull moment.
0385343248|5.0|I know there are some of errors in this book, in regards to Japanese language and historical accuracy. But I don't care. After all this is historical fiction. And this is a brilliant book I keep re-reading for pure fun of being sucked into feudal Japan.<br /><br />How Clavell has managed to research this book before internet is amazing: he may not be 100% accurate but the amount of detail<br />crafted into the story is remarkable. It seems, to me, he fully understood the book's subject.<br /><br />I love books that change your point of view before main character changes his. You want Blackthorne to become a real samurai, even though his resistance is by any means understandable.<br /><br />Clavell is a fantastic storyteller. The reader quickly grasps the rules of this strange, alien world and can only hope the character can grasp them fast enough to survive. A must read.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I absolutely love this DVD. I honestly didn't know much about Phantom of the Opera. I knew it was a broadway show many years ago. I had seen the movie a few years ago and liked it. But I wanted to learn more about the live productions. Just so happens this version was shown on my public broadcast channel and I sat and watched it. I was blown away by the performances in ths production. The music, the staging, The costumes, Everything. But the 3 lead performances. Christine, Raoul, and the Phantom.....OUTSTANDING!!! I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. Which is why I bought it. Ican watch it whenever I want. But actualy, my favorite part was after the performance when Mr Webber came out and spoke and then brought out everyone from all the past productions. That in itself was a show. And when they all sang-------WOW is all I can say. This is a must for every \\"Phantom\\" fan.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Maybe it's just me, but this Reacher tale just didn't spin the prop on my beanie like many of the others did.<br />I can appreciate all the work in dreaming up the story, and getting it plotted out ... it's not bad by any stretch, just not as good as some previous stories. I sure could not buy Reacher being able to find a particular building in New York City just by using his deductive reasoning abilities .... hell, I lose my wife inside the grocery store most of the time ... but Reacher can find the baddies in NYC just by thinking about it a while .... still, it's well worth your time.<br />Anyone know if the movie is still on track? If it is, have they come to their senses and replaced Tiny Tom Cruise as Reacher? Sure hope so ....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I fell in love with Gideon and Eva in Bared To You and am pleased to say I'm even more head over heels with them and their chaotic story.

0525953728|4.0|If you are looking for a first-hand experience of the life of a Navy SEAL, here is the book. The death of UBL is but a subscript to the story told by a former Navy Seal. America's best trained soldiers live a life totally committed to the purpose of their mission. The author refers to it as \\"...getting on the train...\\" It's difficult to get on and it's hard to get off.<br />The books starts with the UBL mission and draws the reader into the historic mission of SEAL team 6, or DEVGRU. Before too much is revealed, the author fades into a mist of backstory on how Team 6 came to be and how he made the team. DEVGRU was involved in some of the most difficult missions over the first 10 years of the war on Terror and our author was front and center for many of them. But this book isn't just another biographical account of Tom Clancy like action. The author goes to great pains, without over sentamentalizing, what the life of a SEAL is really like. The author speaks, in classified detail, about the sacrifices it takes to ride the train of SEAL teams; weeks of training and deployments followed by short stints at home. One story in particular brought home the stark contrast of their lives. After completing a successful mission of grand proportion a member's first greeting upon the return home was cleaning the dirty diaper of an infant. No example could more perfectly capture the compartmentalization of the SEAL life; death and destruction on the one hand, life and nurture on the other.<br />The author valiantly portrays the dichotomous life of the SEAL which bespeaks the dedication these men must have. He also delves unceremoniously into the bond which holds these teams together through the travails of combat stress. They are the family that many of them leave in order serve their country. The author refers to the bond as brotherhood, built on commitment, trust, and a deep striving to be the best team they can be.<br />No Easy Day is a simple read. It does little to surprise the reader. Filled with vivid accounts of battles fought in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Indian Ocean and Pakistan it flows well. It includes plenty of jabs at the current president without going into insubordination. But mostly, it illuminates what it takes for the  government to maintain a workforce of trained professionals. These men are the sheathed sword of American Policy overseas. When the United States President needed a difficult mission accomplished he called on American Special Forces. DEVGRU was a part of that element and they were amazingly successful. The Author of No Easy Day reminds the average protected American reader that our ability to rest on the couch in peace is partly a product of the commitment and dedication of a few highly trained and proficient soldiers who can as easily save a life as they can take one.

0316228532|4.0|I really enjoyed the Casual Vacancy. It took me a while to get into it but after a few chapters I found it very compelling. Yes, many (not all) of the characters are unlikeable once you scratch beneath the surface but I think that simply reflects reality - EVERY person has flaws.<br /><br />I'm disappointed that this book has so many 1 star reviews - this is definitely undeserved. People need to remember that this is not a children's fantasy book - in the real world, people swear and have sex. These elements of society should not be ignored in literature - to do so would be an inaccurate reflection of life.
B005LAII8A|4.0|\\"Looper\\" is an action/science fiction genre film.<br /><br />The narrative set in 2044 presents a grim future where organised crime rules, and the majority of society live poorly. In this time of abject poverty time travel is established, but is an illegal enterprise which is used to carry out contract murders, at a time where disposing of victims is easier.<br /><br />The story unfolds to expose self-interest and lawlessness as decaying hope, but attempts to try to alter the future are the greatest inhibitor for better times.<br /><br />It is the realisation that a brighter future for the world can only be achieved by not interfering with the passage of time, which culminates in protagonist looper Joe Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) taking decisive unilateral action against the cascading impact of looping.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B001KVZ6HK|1.0|This is a review of this package of the movie, not the movie itself.<br /><br />The reason I bought the full 3D Blu Ray version of this movie was to future proof my investment with the included digital copy.  I can buy the HD version from iTunes, BUT the included digital copy of this film is only the SD version.  I did get the movie for the release day price of $19.99.  It is now at $37.99.  When you buy the full version of the film, the digital copy should be in the best format available at this point in time.  When you buy the full HD copies on Blu Ray and the packaging says included Digital Copy and the HD version is the default in iTunes, you would assume that is the version you would get.<br /><br />With this one purchase, I wanted to be done buying this movie again.  Now my cloud copy (that I can stream to my TV) is only an SD version when it should be in HD.  Recent purchases of Jaws and Hunger Games have all had full HD versions of the movies included.  In iTunes right now, I can buy the SD version for $14.99 and the HD version for $19.99. I can also buy the HD version from Amazon for $14.99.  So, now with this product bact at $37.99 and stating Digital Copy, it absolutely should be an HD copy.  Amazon support offered to send me a second copy to see if the HD would work the next time.  They clearly don't understand the issue here.

0316228532|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was a glimpse into the workings of a small English town.  I was amazed to find myself amazed that English people could be as dysfunctional as Americans.  I guess it really is a small world.  Although I will always miss Harry, I laud Ms Rowling for striking out in such a different direction.<br /><br />It's always nice to read a book where every word must be read so as not to miss anything,  rather than so many books where I skip many paragraphs and even pages of useless description trying to get to the story.  Even so, I was glad to finally reach the end.<br /><br />In the Harry books I enjoyed that they would cause most young readers to stretch their vocabulary.  In this book, I was glad to read the Kindle version so that the dictionary was so accessible for stretching my vocabulary.<br /><br />I look forward to her next book.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|10 Stars - Amazon, your 5 star rating system can suck it!<br />This book was FANTASTIC.  Better then Bared to You which was hard to beat!  This book was all over the place.  The first half was typical Gideon and Eva--intense fighting and loving and then the second half was just off the charts.  I really wanted to hate Gideon with all of the secrets, man did I....but then when you find out why....*sigh*!<br />Words can't even express how I feel about this book and this series as a whole.  It was simply amazing!  I am going to give myself a few days to digest and then I will be re-visiting this book again!!  Thank you Sylvia Day for Eva, for Gideon, for Cary and for the entire Crossfire trilogy!  I think I'm in love!  :)

B0054R6BFM|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher connected with me in a way I didn't expect. I read this YA novel because my niece, Kaylee, asked me to. No other reason. I'd never heard of it. I knew nothing about it. Yet, if it was important enough for her to ask me to read it, I felt I needed to. Even with her description of the book, I'm not sure what I expected, but it certainly wasn't what happened. I started reading and couldn't stop. I was already tired when I started and yet I read until exhaustion took over. I felt upset because I couldn't stay awake to finish it. The next day I even broke one of my own rules and recommended the book on social media before I finished reading it or reviewed it. I even emailed a friend to recommend it for his teenage daughter. I found myself on a quest I didn't understand to get this book in the hands of teens and the adults in their lives. When I finished it that night, I cried and cried. I felt pulled and pushed. I recognized a period of time in my life that I'm loathe to admit existed let alone discuss. My heart ached for every person out there struggling to reach out for the help they need... The story isn't that extraordinary or surprising, and that is exactly what makes it so powerful. It is honest and tackles issues without treating teenagers either like they are unrealistically innocent or over the top bad. This is a story about real teenagers without the need to wrap the issues teenagers face in the supernatural or some kind of fantasy world. The realness of Thirteen Reasons Why comes in the fact that it describes situations that happen in teenagers' lives in schools and communities around the world every day of the week. Thirteen Reasons Why reminds us all that the actions we take today have repercussions that we may never anticipate and that may happen long after we've forgotten what we did. In fact, there is also the reminder that inaction can be as deadly as action. Asher weaves a story that is all too believable populated with characters that all too real even making the one or two things the reader may doubt at the beginning quickly seem irrelevant.characters that all too real even making the one or two things the reader may doubt at the beginning quickly seem irrelevant.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is a really great trilogy.  I enjoyed the read. However, at the third book, one was quite sick of all the sex.  I DID appreciate the sex, but after the first book it was \\"kinda\\" boring. The sexing appeared to be all there was to the story.  I would have appreciated a little more exploration on the various points of why these people were the way they were i.e. to better understand the \\"Fifty Shades\\".  Perhaps there's room for a spin-off or \\"a before he was grey\\" series...
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Frankly this is not a bad movie. It had a good idea and was pretty cool. Lets not kid ourselves here i would say roughly every 10 years someone makes a movie about the Navy. Usually in reference to submarines or SEALs. This is the first modern naval war film i know of that doesn't focus on submarines. I'm not too sure why people don't like it. It has a hero, a villan, big guns, and cool effects. It should be well liked. I think the problem is people walk in expecting something that will be off the charts like Inception or something that makes you think a lot during the movie. While this movie will make you think (mainly on how they could possibly win). You wont be mentally thinking to the extent of Inception or some other generally thought provoking film. This film doesn't ask much of its viewers except to sit and watch. It will lay the ground work and walk you through every step.<br /><br />This is a Naval Warfare film so you cant really expect too many twists and turns and curve balls. I will certainly admit that it is not a film for everyone, if your someone who absolutely demands films to leave you awestruck and blown away then this is not a film that i would recommend to you. Because odds are you wouldn't appreciate the subtle awesome things of this film that a Veteran or a military buff would get. Such as when the USS Missouri power slides then fires off those massive 16.5 cannons.<br /><br />This film does show a rebel Naval Officer turning into the officer he is needed to be. This film shows you Naval Firepower at its finest and is the only film i know of that gives the ships this much screen time. You see ships in plenty of films (such as all 3 Transformers but never do they get this much screen time). Then again you would expect this from a film named Battleship. It will certainly appeal to veterans and anyone interested in the mean grey machines that rule the seas. Would certainly be best understood by any military personnel who understand the sacrifice portrayed when the ships go down. Its my opinion that unless you have written that blank check to your country that is payable up to your life then you'll never really understand that sacrifice portrayed.<br /><br />I'm telling you now if you expect a film that provokes deep thought within yourself then this isn't a film for you and I'd advise you continue your search. Because you won't find it here. This film is really good at making you think 1.HOLY CRAP THAT IS AWESOME! 2. I wonder what would really happen in that situation of aliens showing up. and maybe 3. would i be willing to take that risk if i were in their shoes?<br /><br />I found this film to be outstanding and was certainly glad that for once my friends in the Navy who serve on the ships got their due credit. I found this film to be so good i watched it and 30min later i watched it again.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough that people who demand films of the highest quality wont be impressed. However people who like to see heros overcome adversity and overwhelming odds to win the day will enjoy this film.<br /><br />In my opinion its a good film.ortrayed when the ships go down.

B009AJDDQU|2.0|wow glad i did not buy the dvd this was a over rated pumped up movie. short plot low budget retarded ending. how about that background music in the trailer. Sigourney Weaver laughed at this one.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|Drops at random both from LAN connection and also drops wireless clients. 2 of these on the SAME NETWORK randomly can't ping each other.  Either through DHCP OR static IP.  AWESOME.<br /><br />Installed 2 of these on a network for an 8,000 square foot 2 story home at opposite corners.  Router is installed downstairs (EA4500).  Immediately disabled any cloud connect crap (hello security hole).<br /><br />Using antennas at 2.4 or 5gz on the router resulted in no issues with WEP, WPA or WPA2 encryption.  Enabling any kind of wireless signal on the access points resulted in operation for 1-36 hours, at which point random drops of devices from the connection list would start happening.<br /><br />Customer had the EA4500 router before we started the install.  So we wanted to stay with Cisco/Linksys for the access points.<br /><br />After reading the reviews and forums that address this particular device WAP4410N I found that it went through 3 different firmware updates and continued to have the same issue where client devices were dropped from the wireless at random.<br /><br />Maybe this will work better for those with a smaller network workload.  Anyone who has 3+ laptops, 2+ tvpad, 3 network activated tvs, network printer & several smart phones can look elsewhere.  It's like they get overloaded from connections.<br /><br />Moving onto something else that works.<br /><br />(allow me to preclude the response to this - firmware tried was (default)2.0.2.1, 2.0.3.3, 2.0.4.2, 2.0.5.3.  All with factory default & configuration after firmware update).  I'll take a product that works out of the box with minimal upkeep and attention thanks.<br /><br />If there was a \\"ZERO\\" star review this product would get it.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a great series -- very thought provoking, but I keep hoping Hollywood will turn out a series like this WITHOUT ALL THE NUDITY AND FOUL LANGUAGE.  In that regard, this series is disappointing.  Homeland has an all-star cast led by the intense Damien Lewis.  It doesn't need the nudity and foul language for character development with such great actors on board.  Enough said!!!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Very satisfied with this product.  It barely adds any weight to the Kindle, and is not bulky at all. It also clips onto the Kindle securely. The cover that doubles as a stand is also very useful, although you must have it on a level surface to work properly. I would recommend this product.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|Do you fight to change things or do you fight to punish\\" Mohandas Gandhi<br />One event changed not just one man's view of life but the culture of a society marked by hate and discrimination. What should have been a simple train ride for employment sparkle a movement towards change and acceptances. The movie \\"Gandhi\\" reviews the life of Gandhi and how he transformed his thinking and practices to reshape the knowledge that skin color should not dictates ones placement in society. He also attempted to aid in the concept that India should organized itself as one to release the practices of British policies.<br />Gandhi, a young father, husband and lawyer set out on a train ride in South Africa. He was headed to work on a case and was made aware that the darkness of his skin determined his placement of seating. He had traveled first class and learned from an angered policeman that his color didn't allow him to ride first class. He was asked to relocate to the third class area or be forced to be removed from the train altogether. Indeed these actions caused a stir in Gandhi and while sitting a platform watching the train go down the track without him he embraced the idea of change. He leaded the fight in South Africa to change laws that kept people of color from being treated equal.  After some time her returned to his native land and his work followed him. Everyone was eager to meet the man from India pushing for change.  Gandhi took some time out from the spot light to get to learn the country of India and by doing so he was able to see it with a clear view. Many of India's people were poor and suffering from poverty. This is due to the placement of British policies and the use of the natural resources as out port and no return to India's society. Gandhi decided to push for India to run itself without the strong hold and policies of the British. This would cause for him to gather his people together and explain the importance's of freedom from being govern afar. Gandhiwanted the approach to a free India to be positive and non-violent. He encouraged the people involved with the movement  to turn the other cheek and not fight. This would be a battle that caused Gandhi to be jailed countless times and called upon to stop the violent due to the campaign for freedom. Many lives were lost and families displaced as India fought for their release. While the push for moving away from the British was strong also the division of India's own people was starting to show. The understanding of the different types of religion was present, it laid domain until the push of freedom from outside caused Hindus and Muslim to fight each other. Gandhi wanted each sided to see that they could work together and learn from each other religions practices. Yet they couldn't see what Gandhi viewed as a peaceful change and growth amoung India has a nation. This movie teaches one the value of understanding that every one should be treat with respect no matter their skin color or religious beleif. To understand the truth one can find just be pausing and looking around.
0316228532|3.0|... but you cannot. And that's not the fault of the reader, that's the fault of the author. But let's start at the beginning.<br /><br />\\"The Casual Vacancy\\", by JK Rowling, was hands down the most anticipated book of the year. How many authors do you know that say \\"I'm writing a new book\\" and people who don't read for fun start readying their wallets? I pre-ordered this book a long time ago (about 6 months-- right around when it was announced), and have been uber-pumped this entire time. When they released the official description, I was still excited. It sounded different and interesting and realistic. Others were skeptical.<br /><br />But throughout the entire build up of this book, I figured I would be able to love it, because I would be able to separate Harry Potter from TCV. I've always felt that JK Rowling is an insanely talented author, not just some woman who got lucky with a tight plot for seven books. I mean, she wrote seven freaking books, and each one was amazing. That doesn't happen by accident.<br /><br />In this novel, I was looking forward to the beautiful transitions between backstory and forward action, the slight humor in between the actual words, the incredibly deep themes, and well hidden \\"guns\\" (a la Anton Chekhov's \\"the Seagull\\").  That was the JK Rowling I wanted, in a fresh new setting, and I would gladly accept it without wands, despite the fact that I am of *the* Harry Potter Generation (not only that, but the 7th book came out on my 13th Birthday).<br /><br />I must admit, I'm dissapointed. Not in the book itself, but in the fact that JK Rowling wasn't able to set herself apart from what we've come to expect from her. This would have been a good debut for any no name author. But this is from a well-established, talented woman.<br /><br />The opening of this book is weak (although it begins with Death), and it flounders to get up on its feet.<br /><br />After Barry Fairbrother dies, he leaves a council seat open (a \\"casual vacancy\\") and all sorts of \\"war\\" starts to happen, between classes, genders, spouses, etc. The book starts off with a vivid image of Barry's death. Then, it goes to how some of the people in town react to his death. And then to some more people reacting. Oh... and then back to some of the previously mentioned people for a bit. And then back to more new characters having different reactions to Barry's death.<br /><br />The beginning is downright exhausting. This much is true.  New character after new Character is introduced, and it's kind of like the beginning of \\"the Dark Knight Rises\\" earlier this summer, when you need a strong protaganist, but you need all these characters developed for a later payoff. But while reading, its frustrating, and the scenes start to become annoying.<br /><br />Now, Rowling stressed this was an \\"adult\\" book before it was released. And i agree, this is quite an adult book. But it's such an adult book that it comes off as a little try-hard, actually. In the first 5% of the Kindle Version, there are 10-15 f words (and a c word!), an unnecesarry reference to masturbation, and even some nudity to boot (which I know isn't that bad in book form but still). Not to mention a brief sex scene, if you can even call it that. While reading, one can only send telepathic messages to Rowling urging her to \\"please chill out, really, I get that this isn't for children.\\"<br /><br />I don't mind explicit material (I'm 18 for chrissake's, I can handle it), but I don't see it really fitting in in this case. It stands out awkwardly along the simplistic writing, and it is used poorly, as if you taught a 6 year old girl that you yell these words when you're angry, but you don't tell her why. There was a disconnect, because the dialogue doesn't match the prose.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the writing in this book is the sharp, witty stuff you've come to expect from JK. But, if you ask me, its also what ultimately spoiled this book for me. I wanted to love this book and totally separate it from Harry Potter... but the problem is, the writing style will not let you. The descriptions are long, the dialogue cartoonish (at times), and there is just too much sassy wit for it to not be hypercritical.<br /><br />The first section, as we go around and meet all the characters, reads like an extended Dursley Chapter from HP. Every time a new name is introduced, it's some sort of flawed Englishmen, who have no business doing what they're doing. Often, the characters are ugly, inside and out, and JK focuses on these flaws. And you keep begging for a break from this, but what comes? More characters.<br /><br />And that might be the biggest flaw of the book. It leaves you on your knees, eagerly anticipating a magical event, some large revelation or something. All I wanted while reading was a break from the characters, or something crazy to happen that would totally shock their world. I think that's what Barry Fairbrother's death was supposed to be... but it just didn't cut it for the reader.<br /><br />Admittedly, I still haven't finished the novel yet, but I think I'm far enough to know my opinion of it. I'm going to finish this, of course, but, unless there is some groundbreaking twist or something (which signs point to no), then I'm probably not going to return to it again. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it. I mean, a lot of people might read this book just to feel relevant. It's the hot topic for a week or so, so be prepared.<br /><br />****<br />If my opinion changes after I finish this book (50-100 pages left), I'll come back and edit this to reflect my sentiments.y separate it from Harry Potter... but the problem is, the writing style will not let you.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|The characters in the series were so immature, yet supposedly well established, it is like reading an MTV reality show.  I ownly finished the series because I paid for it.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Other reviews have this pretty much right on. It's more of a mystery than horror, although it does incorporate plenty of sci-fi and a little shocker at the end. Character development is very good and most will identify with the primary subject. The end is unsuspected, which is good for me, as I am constantly trying to figure out the twists. This one had me off guard and I liked it. Quite a bit. Great read, nice mind candy and highly recommended for the price.

0316228532|5.0|Ain' no Harry Potter book. And if you're looking for one, look somewhere else. If, however, you are looking for a tightly plotted, intricate political drama about small-town characters who could be real people, this is it.<br /><br />American audiences will take a while to get into the language. Give it some time. Realize that there is no \\"main\\" character... except the one who dies in the first few pages. Relax, let the story unfold. Suddenly, you'll be on the edge of your seat at two in the morning, deciding that sleep is overrated and you need to find out what happens.<br /><br />An excellent novel.

I have tried several times to use the \\"go to furthest page read\\" option on the menu, but it doesn't seem to work, and I end up scrolling for 5-10 minutes to get to my place once again.

B0002V4SXC|5.0|This review is of the SACD layer of the CD, although given it's hybrid and will play on CD players that don't decode SACD, judging from how hybrid CD's sound on players I use that don't decode SACD, my points are likely the same either way.<br /><br />Reference System:  OPPO 95 Universal DVD-CD Player with HDCD & SACD enabled DAC, Counterpoint SA 3000 Preamp - 2200 Amp, Thiel 3.5 Speakers.<br /><br />I'm in my late 50's, a musician by hobby since I was a kid and collector and listener of great music from Folk to Opera since I was a child.<br /><br />This particular CD (SACD Hybrid) is among, if not \\"the\\" best sounding CD I've ever heard and my collection is huge, in the thousands.  In this collection are about a hundred SACD's and same number of HDCD.<br /><br />Quality of the sonics is simply at a level I never dreamed possible given how bad digital is compared to high quality analogue, but this recording is a revelation and frankly; shocking in the most positive way.<br /><br />Musically; well, I'm a big fan of Mark.  I just find his guitar playing incredibly tasteful and creative; consistently.  This CD is no exception.<br /><br />I certainly can reach for more \\"words\\" to try and convey my opinion of the sonics & music on this CD but I think you get the picture.  Seriously; don't flinch on this version of this CD.  It will knock your socks off and remind you of why music is so important to you; not that you need reminding but it genuinely is over the top.
B000JXYJMI|5.0|In viewing this film, The Devil Wears Prada, what could a viewer have in mind?  We are given an answer to this question, \\"What is art?\\", that differs widely from the one given us by Tolstoy.  In Miranda Priestly, head of a slick, trendy fashion magazine, Runway, we see an autocrat who is a fountainhead of fashion design.  There she is a clarion of style for upscale couturiers for women, and price is not a sole marker of quality.  A viewer can take a lesson that discernment is the crown of learning.<br /><br />Into this domain arrives a new, second-level executive assistant and receptionist, Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs, who aspires to be a journalist.  Her academic credentials are excellent, but her personal style is at odds with ambiance of that office.  Her taste and judgment in attire are casual and undiscerning.  Andy is a healthy, well-formed young woman unconcerned with fashionable strictures  of body line in a world of fashion.  As a prospective new hire, only her chances are slender.  Despite Andy's laughably failed interview, Miranda abruptly reconsiders, and her first assistant, Emily, calls Andy back from the street.  Andy starts in her dream job.  The drama takes a serious turn.<br /><br />Andy launches into trying tasks as a new hire in a world of high fashion under the whiplash of impatient but discerning Miranda, whose stick is instant dismissal and whose only reward is continued employment in a prestige publication.  And she is sarcastic and unrelenting.  Miranda is a master of innuendo.  In a meeting with her subordinates to plan a new issue of Runway, she says to a good idea from Nigel, \\"Thank God, somebody came to work this morning!\\"<br /><br />Andrea Sachs, the aspiring journalist, becomes Handy Andy, the duty gopher.  How is she to know when she is doing the right thing?  In desperation, she turns to Nigel, a grudging mentor who gives guidance for her to blossom as a woman of style like others in her company.  Her concern for the feelings of other persons emerges in her work, but relations with her personal friends outside the job suffer.<br /><br />In the complex plot of this film, a trip to Paris opens a larger world of fashion and the power brokers in it.  A viewer of this film must be attentive to catch the many nuances of intrigue.  A sportive world is revealed as a surreal interplay of personalities.  See this film to catch this drama of scenes behind the scene.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is one of those relatively rare movies which is brilliant and deep enough that I quickly realized I won't be able to write a review which does it justice.  I didn't expect much from the movie, didn't read the book, assumed the story was oriented towards kids, and watched it only because the family wanted to.  Well, what a surprise!<br /><br />Through superb acting and perfect blending of all the elements of movies, we're told a rather chilling story which portrays how inhumane and capricious totalitarian power can be, thus strongly reminiscent of Orwell's '1984'.  The ending isn't quite as bleak as '1984' because, through tenacity and cleverness of two of the lead characters, a bit of sand is at least thrown in the eyes of the powers that be, showing that their power isn't absolutely absolute.  But it's close enough to being absolute, and exercised in a way that I found very disturbing at both subtle and obvious levels.<br /><br />Overall, one of the best conceived and crafted movies I've ever seen.  I highly recommend it, though I would say it best suits adults rather than kids, and thinking/sensitive adults at that.

0316212377|5.0|Banks is in top \\"Culture\\" form with this latest novel of that venue.  Perhaps the most challenging aspect of this novel is the fact that all actions, no matter how evil, seem to to be undertaken by actor doing what, to them, seems the \\"right thing to do.\\"  Banks makes a very convincing argument that much of what we call \\"morality\\" is founded on nothing more permanent and enduring that a point of view.  In addition, perhaps more than usual, the inter ship-mind repartee is more glib and amusing than ever.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Highly recommended.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am a Sr. Citizen writing a review of a book that has seized the attention of<br />readers almost half my age. My facetious daughter bought me this e read for my kindle.<br />Well, I am more than half way through the book and what I want to focus upon in this review<br />is not the imaginative sexual scenes, but the character portrayal.<br />I am most enjoying following the development of Anastasia Steele. The author, E.L James<br />does a wonderful job in letting the reader know of Anastasia's thinking on a tri level<br />axis: i.e. her conscious mind, which tells of her ambivalence; her subconcious mind which<br />warns her to flee from Christain Grey's seduction; her sexual desire which certainly<br />takes over and pushes her forward with Grey.<br />Her wish and hope that she can tame this complex man so that he would be able to give her<br />a complete and \\"normal\\" relationship courses throughout. Because he does,at times, sucuumb<br />to her emotional needs, the reader is left curious. Also, there is anticipation about finding out the story about Grey's early childhood trauma that had shaped his avoidance of receiving affection and love. I am 70% through the book and I am looking foreward to<br />getting the answer as to how the author leaves the couple at the end. I do recommend this book.

It was a little slow going at first, but it turns out that she is such a good writer that you stay invested even though not that much actually happens, at least in the first half of the book. If you like \\"slice of life\\" type books you will enjoy this one. By the second half, I was eager to continue reading it.

0812993292|5.0|Redemption, how many of  us want a chance at it?  Would we jump at it like a passing rope swing and grab on tightly or would we just watch as it swings to a halt and let the time pass us by.  The protagonists of Rachel Joyce's new novel The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry  had that chance and he grabbed the swing.  His name of course is Harold Fry.<br /><br />Harold is an ordinary sort of bloke, a retired salesman, sort of aimless and  if he was a woman we would call him frumpy.  He seems to be estranged from his wife and son and when he receives a letter from an old co-worker which informs him that she, Queenie is dying of cancer, he begins walking.  He decides that if he walks to her she will live and so begins his journey from one end of England to another.<br /><br />Coincidentally, Rachel Joyce began writing the play on which the book was based for her father who was dying of cancer, hoping that he would get to see her work.  Sadly he didn't but perhaps this makes the book all the more poignant.<br /><br />Rachel Joyce seems to have the ability to capture the little moments and make them grander and can encapsulate all the sad pitfalls in a relationship, so we can examine how things can go terribly wrong for the most well-meaning.  While sitting at a restaurant Harold over hears the couple at the next table:<br /><br />\\"He was interrupted by the couple at the next table.  They had raised their voices.  Harold wanted to get away, but there appeared to be no safe slice of silence in which he might stand and excuse himself.<br /><br />The woman who loved Jane Austen said, \\"Do you think it was funny cooped up here with a broken leg?\\" Her husband kept on looking at his map as if she had not spoken, and she continued to speak as if he was not ignoring her.  \\"I never want to come here again.\\"<br /><br />Harold wished the woman would stop.  He wished the man would smile or take hold of her hand.  he thought of himself and Maureen and the years of silence at 13 Fossebridge Road.  Had Maureen ever felt the impulse to say where everyone could hear such truths about their marriage?  The thought had never occurred to him before, and was so alarming he was already on his feet and heading for the door.  The couple didn't seem to notice that Harold had gone.\\"<br /><br />In truth, this is a lovely book.  It examines the relationship between Harold and his wife Maureen in such a quiet understated way.  I love that in so many ways they have such ordinary lives which they have let slip away, like sand through their fingers and then are given this second chance by Harold walking to Queenie.<br /><br />I know perhaps, not everyone will love this as much as I did.  I've read an opinion that found it predictable, while I didn't see it that way at all.  I found many surprises and loved Harold's journey, but then I am always a sucker for a good trip.  I think though if one takes the time to absorb the quiet and kind statements of this book , its brilliance shines through.ridge Road.

0761169253|5.0|A 12th century French monk, Bernard of Chartres, once observed, \\"We are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants.\\" I thought of that observation as I read Austin Kleon's brief but insightful discussion of ten \\"things nobody told you about being creative,\\" with the first serving as this book's title. There are dozens of quotations throughout the narrative that reaffirm Kleon's thesis: Almost anyone can become more creative in what they do and how they live by applying the lessons that Kleon learned during the past decade. What he learned, of course, is what he stole from others and then applied...and the world wisdom they possessed had been stolen from still others and then applied...you get the idea.<br /><br />In his thought-provoking book, Ignore Everybody, Hugh MacLeod identifies and discusses a total of 40 \\"keys to creativity\\" and, of course, the first is to Ignore Everybody. Taken literally, that would include both MacLeod and Kleon. However, in each of his several books, MacLeod duly acknowledges his appreciation of countless others who have helped him to become the best Hugh MacLeod he could be. My own opinion is that Kleon has a similar objective: To help his reader think more creatively about becoming more creative by introducing his reader to a variety of different perspectives that will help the reader to become more alert, more aware, of how to live a more productive, a more enjoyable, a more fulfilling life.<br /><br />The quotations he includes are indeed excellent. Several have become classic insights. Here is a representative selection:<br /><br />o  \\"Art is theft.\\"  Pablo Picasso<br />o  \\"The only art I'll ever study is stuff that I can steal from.\\"  David Bowie<br />o  \\"What is originality? Undetected plagiarism.\\"  William Ralph Inge<br />o  \\"It is better to take what does not belong to you than to let it lie around neglected.\\"  Mark Twain<br />o  \\"Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy you will find your self.\\"  Yohji Yamamoto<br />o  \\" The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.\\"  Jessica Hische<br />o  \\"Complain about the way other people make software by making better software.\\"  Andre Torrez<br />o  \\"Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.\\"  Gustave Flaubert<br /><br />My take on \\"artistic theft\\" is that it is essential to the development of more creative thinking. All of the world's great chess players throughout history, for example, devoted thousands of hours to studying and replaying, then evaluating the greatest matches in decades past. The advice \\"steal only from the best\\" is relevant to just about all (if not all) human initiatives. However, it is also imperative to then make what you steal your own. In the field of human development, Oscar Wilde is correct: \\"Be yourself. Every one else is taken.\\" That has been true of Leonardo, Shakespeare, Mozart, and countless other creative artists...and it is also true of those who read this book. I am grateful to Austin Kleon for sharing what he has learned from others and then made it his own: this book.lf.\\"  Yohji Yamamoto<br />o  \\" The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life.\\"  Jessica Hische<br />o  \\"Complain about the way other people make software by making better software.\\"  Andre Torrez<br />o  \\"Be regular and orderly in your life, so that you may be violent and original in your work.\\"  Gustave Flaubert<br /><br />My take on \\"artistic theft\\" is that it is essential to the development of more creative thinking.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great story for kids that explores a lot of adult issues:  totalitarianism, justice, survival, and more.  The idea of putting kids in an arena is a sensitive one for adults, but for young readers it helps them relate to the story and the characters, and makes them care about what happens to them.<br /><br />I read this book after seeing the movie with my niece (13) who had read all the books.  We had a great discussion over the differences between the movie and the book.  In some ways this is one of those rare instances where the movie made the book better (by introducing us to Seneca Crane and President Snow and helping us see the story from their point of view enriched things.  My niece did not like how the Avoxes were left out of the movie, and having read the other two books, I can see why; it forces Katniss to deal with the cruelty of the Capitol to more than just herself.  I hope they address the issue in the Catching Fire movie.

B009GEN1ZW|5.0|The premise behind Castle that is a writer shadows a NYPD Detective in order to gather \\"research\\" for his novels. The show is so much more though as it incorporates comedy while still solving a murder each week.<br /><br />The Season 5 premiere was incredible. It furthered Beckett's mom's case while giving her some closure but leaving it open for more later. This allowed the characters to bring some more of the light banter back. As usual with Castle, more than meets the eye with all the episodes making you want to watch it multiple times.<br /><br />If you are looking for an incredible show that is worth your time, this show is for you!

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Open your mind and this book will change you for the better.  If you have ever asked yourself \\"why do I believe what I believe? Is it because I was born into a culture or family with these beliefs?  Would I believe different if I had diffrent parents?\\" Then this book is for you.  If you are a seeker, this book is for you.  If you are looking for practical ideas on being a happier person and having a better life experience, this book is for you.  The only reason you would not want to read this book is if you are closed minded or think that you already have all the answers.  This book truly changed the way i look at things.  It took what I know to be truth and put it into words with a practical guide for application.  Awesome book that I plan on re-reading at least once a year.

0307891372|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this strategy guide.<br /><br />Skyrim in general is a super-massive game with content stretching into the hundreds of hours (if not more with the PC version). How on earth are we supposed to keep this in track? Well the Skyrim game guide is a great place to start.<br /><br />Although it does not cover anything that has been released by Bethesda since the game came out (such as Dawnguard or other major updates), the game guide is spectacular for maps of everything, every item, and telling you if the random place you stumbled on is part of a future quest or not (which is what I use it for more than anything).<br /><br />Every place I travel to, I check the index at the back of the guide to see what interesting content I should keep my eye out. It also helps satisfy the completionist part of my game-playing personality in helping acquire every daedric artifact, major magic weapon, unique items, etc.<br /><br />Also worth noting, although it is priced around the same as other strategy guides, this guide is easily five times as long as those (unless they were for another super-massive RPG). For instance, my FFXIII strategy guide is barely half the volume of the Skyrim guide, and that is for a Final Fantasy sized game.

I finally got a chance to watch it and I was pretty disappointed.  I didn't think the trailer for the movie was representative of the overall tone of this movie.  They try and sell this movie as a lighthearted comedy, but it's anything but.  It's actually quite long and some parts are just plain depressing (no laughs at all).  I really like both of these actors, but this script was a miss.  I would not recommend this movie--it's not a comedy, but not a good drama either, it's just kind of blah.

Ive seen some bad reviews saying no mobs or not crafting. I say bs. that is true in the free version but not the paid. One thing to keep in mind. The game is not complete! Just like the pc game you get to play it as it is developed.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|So enjoyed reading this book but I felt as though Stephen didn't quite know how to end it. I didn't have an \\"aah\\" moment when I thought \\"yes, if you meddle in the past, this is what will happen\\". Not very plausible. He painted a lovely portrait of life back then.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|had fun! enjoyed it but too much back n forth,  map with quick transportation would help a lot. mysterious and thrilling!
B00000JLWW|5.0|A used copy.  No scratches  or anything bad on the DVD.  Very good movie.  If you never saw the movie, you don't know what your missing out on.  Great love story, lots of drama, and excitement.  Also very educational on the events that took place on the real Titanic.  Great movie, very inexpensive to purchase.
B006VA57CY|5.0|This season highlighted the \\"issues\\" as some saw it during the first world war and it's impacts on the prestigious upper class, as well as the impacts on the common class. While the show had a few war scenes, it was more based on the impact that the war had at home, and how the members at home dealt with these issues. The stunning conclusion was well written out, and left room for a third season which should be launched early 2013. I can't wait to see season 3 of this show.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|I haven't stopped playing this album since I bought it.  Lzzy Hale has a voice that can carry you away.  My favorite on this album is Mz Hyde.
B008KEQMDC|1.0|I bought this movie because I love the actors in it and because I love being able to view the movie on other equipment thanks to the digital copy and ultraviolet.  Unfortunately, even though this movie is brand spankin' new, my copy did not come with the digital copy.  So I wrote the vendor requesting to return it because the digital copy was missing. The vendor advised me that they had put a note in the description stating  \\"no uv included\\"  This I did not see.  He said it was there.  I guess the giant words on the dvd box saying \\"DVD + DIGITAL COPY + ULTRAVIOLET\\" diverted my attention away from the short small and sweet phrase, \\"no uv included\\" in their description of the product. Now, I know that there are instances when the digital copy is not provided. Usually if it is purchased used or the date on the back of dvd box states the code discontues after a certain date.  What's different even in these instances is that the digital copy is there but just unuseable.  In my case there was no digital copy at all.  Therefore I will not be getting an exchange, a refund or anything. So I am giving some friendly advice.  BUYER BEWARE: DOES YOUR VENDOR OFFER THE DIGITAL COPY?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are several detailed reviews here. So I will try to keep it short and sweet. I am surprised that I couldn't find a review that compared the book with City of Ember. That is too an amazing book but is more geared towards children. This one appears to be targeted towards adults and tries to tackle complex issues having to do with hope and human nature but still is quite \\"family friendly\\" and certainly could be enjoyed by younger readers without parents being concerned.<br /><br />The books start off as smaller shorter stories but turn into a full sized book when combined. The story progresses quite satisfyingly and it appears that the Author continues to keep your interest in the story and you do not get the jaded feeling that is sometimes experienced in longer books.<br /><br />If you like (or can tolerate) either scifi or post-apocalyptic story lines then you simply cannot wrong with this book. Trust me and thousands of other reviewers and give it a shot. Then come back and type a positive review for the author for he certainly has done us a favor by keeping the Kindle Price so low and affordable.<br /><br />I will definitely be looking into other books by Hugh Howie
B008IJTFYW|4.0|The wind and waves do not sound natural,otherwise,it is very helpful. I love the temple setting.  It also stays on while the screen is off so light does not keep me awake.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|In this moment does it again with this album BLOOD.  I loved the title track and you're going to listen is so for lack of a better term catchy i have been singing it for days.
0061122416|5.0|Are you kidding me? This book is SUPPOSED to be simple and blunt! Amongst a slew of disturbing novels of terror, violence, adultery, revenge, and greed (the list could continue), how dare someone write a simple book meant to re-inspire the uninspired and give hope to those who gave up their dreams because they were told they weren't \\"realistic\\"? Normally I steer clear of all \\"mass market\\" books which everyone and their mother has read, even those who are not \\"readers.\\" I am a reader. When I was in junior high, I began coming home from the library every other week with a stack of 20 books to read. Yet, this book is different from those just aiming to sell and make the author money. This is a simple book that inspires. It's as SIMPLE as that, and that's all there is to it. Keep dreaming. And definitely buy this book. Read it and re-read it when you forget to keep on living your passion. This book deserves 5 stars and nothing less.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If you are looking for secrets, they are not there. If you are looking condemnation of the present administration, it is not there.<br />This is a well written inside look of seal operations. It contains much more than the operation to get OBL. It tells the story of how the SEAL teams operate as a unit there deadication to to the job. This is a great read!
B0012GMVG2|5.0|This album to me is utter perfection. Every shade of musical brilliance is etched into this time capsule from 1982. You cannot go wrong with this selection---there is no place like home on a cold, chilly winter's night by the fire with this playing in the background and the love of your life in your arms.
B00979OL5A|2.0|this is a gay game its to long to download and its well its lagin a lot nooooooooooo never get this game its a ripof
0316228532|1.0|Boring. Boring. Boring. Boring. NOT a adult book. She is still writing for children except this one has  vulgar words and sexual situations (from the teenagers no less). Her style of writing is such that  a fifth grader could read and comprehend. The book read like a bad soap opera. She even wrote it so you can move from scene to scene knowing what others are doing at that particular moment. I am still wondering why I spent two days reading this book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'm not a fan of superhero movies & really didn't want to see this movie at all, but I ended up loving it! There's a variety of lovable characters, an exciting storyline, & good overall plot.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for me to love Gideon Cross any more than I already did, but by the time I got to the end of this book I discovered how wrong I was!  I have a top 10 list of Book Boyfriends and let me tell you that Mr. Cross is in the top of that list.  I am a sucker for a tortured hero and Gideon has that in spades.<br /><br />This book literally picks up right where the first one left off.  I complained in my review of Bared to You about how Eva runs at the first sign of any conflict.  She is still doing that, but to be fair no time has really passed for her and throughout the course of this story she does grow up some, but she still has that tendency to jump to conclusions.  In her defense, though, Gideon does make it awfully hard for her.  They are still learning to trust each other and while I do believe that deep inside they do, it's really hard for them to show it.<br /><br />I liked that we got to meet a couple new characters in this book.  I loved Eva's dad, I really hope that we get to see more of him in the next book.  I was also really happy to see that Eva is realizing how important it is to have other friends.  She loves Gideon and he is everything to her, but she is also starting to realize the need to have other people that she can count on.<br /><br />I liked Cary in the first book, but I loved him in this one. This book was really rough on him, but he came through like the champ that he is.  He still has some stuff to work through, but it's clear that he's a good person and he really loves Eva and I think he's really good for her.  He is the one who makes her think through all the stuff that's going on with Gideon.  He wants what is best for her so he'll always be there for her when she needs him.<br /><br />Gideon was the one who really grew the most in this book.  He is still secretive and he is constantly hiding things from Eva.  He wants her to trust him, but at the same time he is making it impossible for her do so.  He makes a tremendous breakthrough and when he does it's a beautiful thing to see (or read).  I don't think either of them are all the way there, but I think they are so incredibly close that it's going to make the wait for the next book almost unbearable!<br /><br />There is no denying that there are some incredibly sexy love scenes in this one.  If you thought the first book was hot, you have NO idea!  Sylvia takes it to the next level with this one, it's going to be hard to top, but I have no doubt in my mind that she will blow us away with book three.tremendous breakthrough and when he does it's a beautiful thing to see (or read).

1455502758|5.0|As usual, Hitchens doesn't disappoint.  Truly one of the greatest public intellectuals to ever be alive.  May he rest in peace
0451418441|1.0|I read Pillars and it was about a 3.5 out of 5 for me.  I did watch the movie version on TV and found it a lower than the book since lots of the building details were left out.  I did find the cathedral building interesting but wasn't compelled to read the sequel right away.  Then I bought a Nook and the sequel was available, so downloaded it.  What a disappointment.  I know the words coming out of the characters' mouths were not even used in the time period.  The f word? Really?  One woman asking another if she'd f^&&* him yet?  Perhaps having read all of Dorothy Dunnett's books, I now have too high an expectation for historical fiction but it felt like Follett assigned someone else to write most of the book and only filled in some of the historical parts himself.  I actually was able to 'swipe' my way through pages and pages and still get the main points of the story, stopping to read the more interesting bits about the bridge building.  The characters seemed wooden.  The sex was gratuitous.  I had paid my money so finished it as quickly as possible to be able to get on to better writers.  Sadly, I will now not be tempted to pick up any more of his books.  Sometimes I think the writer has a book inside he wants to write but when done, the publisher pushes him to write a sequel to make more money.  The author really didn't have any story beyond what he'd already written but succumbs and then is stuck writing drivel.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|\\"Homeland\\" is a fantastic series that is not to be missed. The writers are excellent, and the actors are pitch perfect. We just completed the third episode last night. There is a twist at the end that I could not figure out for several minutes. I like watching anything that makes me think, and \\"Homeland\\" does just that. We're both finding it very enjoyable, but not easy to sit through. The suspense is very intense. I have been squirmy since the opening credits of the Pilot. Seven more episodes to go...
B0098VXE50|5.0|It was great! I loved this movie, and can't wait to see it again! And it came in a speedy manner!
0767802659|4.0|I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it! I think it is worth buying! Good to have in your collection
B0098VXE50|5.0|This was a very well crafted and acted film. A good mix of realism fantasy and well done computer creations. The Troll in the Forest was the best I have seen yet! I bought this for my daughter for a reward for her hard work at college. I would watch it again gladly.
B008XG1X18|4.0|it's really touchy at times, but I feel pinterest always is, even on my computer and ipad. but, I love pinning too much to care!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I finished this book in one day. I love the story and intensity between Giddon and Eva. Can't wait for the next one
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Excellent reading - would be 5 stars, except for explicit language.  All those brave men and women who sacrifice to keep us safe should always be provided for, especially those brave Navy Seals.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Half the time this app has problems starting up on my fire.  The entire device freezes or I get an error message and have to force stop the app.  I love pinterest and when it finally starts, the app is great.
034552554X|4.0|Copy arrived on time, nicely packed and looking just as described.<br />Cover looked perfect.  I was giving it as a gift, so I was happy to see I was able to do that, since<br />the copy looked new.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book I feel was way better than 50 shades! Don't get me wrong I loved 50 but this one just took me to another level! Can't wait for the other two books!
B0095R64AO|4.0|I recently rented Five Year Engagement from Amazon Video. I have seen Emily Blunt and Jason Segel in other movies and was curious as to how their chemistry would work in Five Year Engagement.<br />Although predictable, I would recommend this movie as it was charming, sweet and had funny moments.<br />I could see a part II in the works.
B00785P2QC|4.0|pretty good game I tend to become addicted to this types and there's are something I don't like this game however is good. I hate buying things but this game u don't have to some games u have to buy to move on which I hate
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. very relaxing. I just wish you got more coins. Great for all ages. It's. worth getting enjoy I sure do the higher the level the more coins you get. I am on level. 226 and have over 30.000. Coins We need another game update to get more puzzles and dozer cash
1593272782|3.0|good book. ihave many lego pieces. got lucky and found a lego set on the lego education web site with many parts. i built many sets. no instructions. just pictures. no  explanation why does the creations. cant wait till better technic books are published.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am a huge Reacher fan ... and this book bored me to tears. 90% of the book is so slow that it is almost not readable. The first third of the book or so involves Reacher sitting in a car. No action. No wit. No suspense. Nothing.<br /><br />Child phoned this one in. Terrible.<br /><br />It is a shame I had to give this one star ... zero would have been better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|MIGHT READ THIS AGAIN TO SEE IF I MISSED ANYTHING. IT OPENED UP A WHOLE NEW WORLD.  COULDN'T WAIT TO READ THE WHOLE SERIES.
B008NW67IQ|3.0|i thought, Sign No More, was genius and beautiful. i pre-ordered Babel and listened to it this weekend driving up the california coast and boy was i disappointed.<br /><br />more of the same, only worse. little growth, a lot of banging without the beautiful melodies and building anthems. bring back the guys who did Sign No More.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy coming back to this game to unwind... can be mindless or you can be challenged to get certain prizes.
0425263908|5.0|This book was a good read, very similar to 50 shades of grey but not so long.  Good read nontheless.  I let my girlfriends read it too and they enjoyed it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After hearing about the book Fifty Shades of Grey from every source out there, I finally broke down and acquired the book via my Kindle.  I suppose if one likes to read adult/sexually explicit material non-stop, then the book would be great.  I found it unrealistic and after a while, even boring.
B005LAIHR2|3.0|I saw this movie in the theater with my wife who is a huge fan of rock n roll and the 80's so it was a match made in heaven for her! Thats why im buying it for her. It was very silly for me and a bit drawn out but enjoyable enough to not make it too annoying. Warning: do not expect any originality.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins gives us a breathtaking sc-fi thriller that is hard to put down. She never exploits the violence. She gives us a futuristic dystopian novel that explores its totalitarianism's cruel society that joins classics like 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and Animal Farm. Brilliant
B008CO1DPM|5.0|The overall installation took me less than a hour. This barebone is clearly for people that can use for work. It has two COM ports, something that would allow me to do J-tag and connect to Cisco routers or any other equipment uses com ports. That's something you can't find in modern computers unless you still kept on really old laptop or computers around for work. I probably going to build another one of these in the near future.<br /><br />The installation was super simple. Just have to buy 4 items and your done. CPU, Memory, HDD, Slim DVDRW drive.<br /><br />My Build<br />Intel core i3 3225<br />DDR3 16GB<br />500gb Sata hdd<br />slim dvdrw<br /><br />Windows7 rates 5.9 only cause of my slow hdd.<br /><br />everything after shipping and tax came down to under $500.<br /><br />This is a purely for work setup, I'm not planning it for HTPC or gaming, but it should work just fine.<br /><br />My game system's side fan 1x230mm (CM HAF X) is about the size of this case, which is pretty sad.<br /><br />The case clearly shows how modern M-ITX can be fast, powerful and very useful.<br /><br />Other comments:<br />The difference between the XH61 and XH61v that mattered to me, was getting the two com port, the USB3.0 was a Bonus.<br />So if someone just wants a HTPC or small gaming desktop, get xh61, it save you a few bucks.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I could not put the book down. I can't wait to read the other two. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because it was not the kind of writing a best seller should be. Lets just say, it was an easy read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved these books and could not put it down. Buy all 3 its so worth it.  I hope that she continues to write more like this
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Obviously you've already bought this book, because you couldn't get enough of the first one. So why are you reading these reviews when you could be reading part two?? Laters baby ;)
B008PNBU30|4.0|Leading up the the release I did hear they were going to try something different and its works mostly. It certenitly is different but I enjoyed all the songs. I have been a huge fan since their first album and haven't heard a song from them I haven't liked. Warning though, DO NOT buy this album blindly! Listen to the samples first and then decide so you will not be filled with regret if you disagree with me and do not like the direction 3dg is going.
0525953728|5.0|The book \\"No Easy Day\\" gave the Navy Seals a forum to tell the story of the raid as they performed it.  The first person \\"eyes on\\" view of the raid gives the reader an opportunity truthfully see the raid and understand the preparation and training that is required to complete such an important mission.  You feel as though you are standing over the shoulder of the writer, as he goes through all phases of the mission, the good and the bad.  The final section that memorializes the Navy Seals that have made the ultimate sacrifice and organizations that help the families and disabled warriors is a great reference for charitable activities.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|The movie was really funny!  I would recommend renting it.  Not for young kids, but really worth watching.  I love the convenience of Amazon.
B0098VXCR0|2.0|The visual style of the film was very well done and set up a nice scene to look at and imagine, but everything else fell short. Apart from Charlize Theron's performance being exceptional all of the actors were forced to work with a sub-par plot and weak direction. There is little character direction and what seems like it could be an interesting angle between the huntsman, the prince, and snow white is quickly hurried past to move the action along.<br /><br />In short, it looks good but you'll end up wishing you'd watched something better.
B008133DO8|5.0|After that awesome cliffhanger in the last episode of the first season, I eagerly awaited the second season, and I wasn't disappointed! These episodes are basically movies, but they pull you into what's happening, making you end each episode asking for more. I ended up watching the whole second season in one day... You could say I'm addicted. The actors are perfect for their characters, with Irene Adler's single appearance making Sherlock feel as if he had met his match (not Jim Moriarty). Deduction at its finest, Sherlock pulls you in and shows you how the great detective answers the problems he's faced with. The last episode is INTENSE, and I'm feeling the same as I did after the first season finished... Is the next season out yet?
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the beautiful pics that are found here so many things to see very good ideas as well . a chance to see many different things
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Yes i know that word doesn't exist, but I don't care! I loved this movie from beginning to end and every character in it (except black widow who was annoying and simply doesn't fit with the others but she was in the comics, so whatever). This won't win any oscars but I do believe it is one of the best movies of the year! (still thought DKR was a better film though)
B0098VYKSA|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and the graphics. I did not want to write a review. Please do not make it a requirement otherwise this will be my last review.
B008220AVW|4.0|This movie did not let me down like I expected it would. Katy Perry looks real sexy in that one outfit and quite sexy in a couple of other outfits.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have had to delay buying the next book in the series because I can't put it down once I start.  Love this story.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I've enjoyed many Sherlock shows, books & films, this is a great adaptation, fun to watch! Very true to the great characters set in a modern time.

B003Y2BMVC|5.0|Treasure Planet reminds me of when I was kid!  I loved this show!  It's fun and entertaining, even now.  I loved watching this show and then reading the book its based on, Treasure Island.  A classic in my eyes.

B006XF5BTG|3.0|Different from the ridiculous rip-off that is \\"Living lean\\" by Mike Dolce, this books actually offers calculations for total calorie intake when bulking and cutting. It would be interesting to see the references of the scientific studies the author bases some of his arguments on. I, for instance, hold a PhD in Exercise Biochemistry and a BSc in Sports Sciences, so I'd like to read and double check such studies. Additionally, some of the arguments about genetic engineering in the food industry are just not well founded.<br /><br />On the other hand, the tips about supplement consumption at the beginning of the book are quite interesting since according to the author is not really necessary to consume protein supplements immediately after training. A simple shake made out of oatmeal and fruit, for example, might provide enough proteins and carbohydrates for both recovery and breakfast (these tips however are a bit ambiguous by the end of the book where the author does recommend post-exercise consumptions of some supplements).<br /><br />Regarding the training method, it is well known in the scientific literature that muscle hypertrophy depends on both muscle strength, which you develop working with high loads and few repetitions, and circulatory factors (nutrients and hormones), so it necessary to include moderate-to-high loads and > 6 repetitions (10-12 ideally). This goes against the views of the author that claims that high loads are enough to develop strength and size. You can review these data on the American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines for Strength and Conditioning.<br /><br />Overall, the book does provide you with useful information about calorie intake. If you are new to resistance exercise, this book would help you get started. If you have been training for some months now,you might have heard or read most of the info here everywhere else.

0446547646|4.0|The story \\"The Best of Me,\\" by Nicholas Sparks is an excellent book.  It tells the story of high school love birds getting separeted senior year for reasons based off their surrounds in their town.  The two knew they were destined to be together, but they were looked down upon by others.  As they grow older they start new lives, but one thing they shared brings them back together to meet once again.  They are givin a mission to complete while back in their home town before reutruing to their other lives.  Though as the two meet there love begins to rekindle.  This book is rather intersting and easy to follow.  Some unexpected events occur that only encourage you to want to read more.  At times this books was a little slow, but it would quickly pick back up again.  This book really allowed me to think about what was going to happen in the chapters to come and constatnly had me guesssing.  I have always loved reading Nicholas Sparks' work, so if that is you as well then this is one you should defidently read.  I would also recommend this book to anyone who enjoys love stories with a litle twist here and there.

0547258305|5.0|I have read a lot of books this year, but not since I read The Hunger Games Trilogy back in March have I been captivated by characters, themes and an entire world as much as while reading Graceling. Funny enough, I almost did not read this book; I checked it out from the library but the daunting 481 pages made me weary to begin, especially with other lighter reads to occupy my time. However, I am so glad that I invested the time to read what is now one of my favorite books!    Graceling is a fantasy novel where certain individuals (Gracelings) are \\"graced\\" with supernatural abilities that set them apart from regular people. A Graceling is distinguishable by two different colored eyes and are often ostracized for being different. Protagonist Katsa, the 18-year old orphaned niece of tyrant King Randa, is graced with the ability to fight, making her more powerful than any stronger or better trained adversary. King Randa takes advantage of his niece's grace by making her his powerful weapon against anyone who crosses him in even the smallest way. Troubled by her uncle's abuse of power, Katsa has created a Council to help bring justice to people in her kingdom and the six surrounding kingdoms so she is able to use her grace for good. During a rescue for the Council to find the kidnapped father of the Lienid King, Katsa meets Prince Po of Lienid, who is also graced and he becomes one of her few dear friends. Together Katsa and Po learn how to develop and control their graces as they embark on a whirlwind journey to uncover the mystery of Po's grandfather's kidnapping.    I don't usually pursue fantasy/adventure, which is funny because most of the books in this genre that I read have easily become my favorites {Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, The Princess Bride}. I think it has something to do with having to alter my perception of \\"normal\\" and the effort it takes to understand the world the author has created. I usually like to read to relax {I spent enough time in collegereading books that made me work too hard!}, so putting in this extra effort sometimes seems like it's not worth the pay out {this is exactly why I keep dodging reading Game of Thrones, despite everyone telling me that it's necessary}. Well, let me say that Graceling is well worth the initial effort expended for the story Cashore delivers.    Written for ages 14 and up, the prose is very easy to understand despite the complexities of the world Cashore creates. Despite being a childrens/young adult book, Cashore includes some very mature content including graphic violence and sexual encounters. However, these scenes are where Cashore's writing really shines; her ability to vividly articulate the fights that take place between Katsa, Po and others makes you feel like you are watching a movie. I generally don't care for action books because they can be difficult to follow; this is not the case with Graceling. Similarly and yet conversely, the sexual scenes are so beautifully crafted that they are the furthest thing from inappropriate, even for a 14-year old audience. They aren't nearly as abundant as the fight scenes, but Cashore has a way of using words to outline exactly what she wants you to see and color in exactly how she wants you to feel.    More impressive than her prose are the characters and themes Cashore develops in Graceling. Katsa can best be described as a typical, emotional 18-year old girl with a passion for justice in an environment that wishes to use her for evil. Initially Katsa is somewhat resigned to her role as a \\"monster\\", only fighting for justice in secret. It isn't until she meets Po that he gives her the courage to publicly fight back against evil and the acceptance to explore her grace and tame it for good. The friendship of Katsa and Po presents the theme of depending on other people, namely your friends, for support and positive affirmation. Before Katsa meets Po she is afraid of trusting others for fear they will try to control her similar to King Randa. In beautiful literary symmetry, Katsa also teaches Po to depend on her later in their friendship.    Graceling addresses the traditional theme of good versus evil; however, it approaches this deeper by  exploring how individuals choose to use their talents for good or evil. By introducing the concept of Gracelings, Cashore invites the reader to pay closer attention to how their graces are used, the effects of their choices magnified. For example, King Randa chooses to use Katsa's grace for evil whereas Katsa chooses to use her grace for good. Katsa is able to make the choice of whether or not she is a monster or not and Cashore does a great job articulating Katsa's experience. There are many other examples of how Gracelings choose to use their graces, but I don't want to spoil the story!    I could honestly continue explicating this novel for days and wish I had read it in college so I would have had the opportunity to write more in depth about the characters and themes. The only thing I can say at this point is go read this book, you won't regret it!! My only complaint is that there are two companion novels which I mistook for sequels, I really wish I could keep reading about the same characters!    Bottom Line: A great action/adventure fantasy with memorable characters and a powerful message. Well-written and exciting to read, I would recommend this book to anyone! If you loved The Hunger Games, I think you will love Graceling.    For more reviews: [...]

B004LWZWGK|5.0|\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" not only ends the trilogy made by Christopher Nolan nicely, but it does so with plenty of action, spectacle, and a very memorable conclusion!  While I do not believe it to be a better film than the 2nd film in the trilogy, \\"The Dark Knight\\", I do believe it to be better than the amazing \\"Batman Begins\\".  This film is very dark, violent, well acted, and very intense; it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film.  The movie opens with an amazing introduction to the film's main villain, Bane, and continues from there where the last movie left off.<br />Batman is now a fugitive, believed to be a murderer, and has now been in hiding for 8 years.  Eventually, Bruce once again dons the cape and cowl to become the dark knight, and from then on, the action and suspense does NOT let up in the slightest! The acting by the A-list cast of actors is very well done! Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Michael Cane once again do amazing in their roles.  New notable actors to the cast are: Tom Hardy, Ann Hathaway, and Joseph Gordon Levit; all of which do an amazing job in their roles!<br />Even though this film is amazing and engaging, it is not perfect.  There are some plot holes and some very noticeable editing flaws (most likely due to the PG-13 rating).  There is even a scene where a hallucinating Bruce Wayne sees an image (or ghost?) of someone from his past; this scene was poorly done and fairly confusing.<br />Obviously the film is not released yet, not until December 4th, but I will be buying the blu-ray combo pack the day it is released! Everyone that is a Batman fan, superhero fan, comic book fan, or just an action movie fan should not hesitate in buying this phenomenal movie as soon as it is available. You will NOT be disappointed!

B009G8GRX6|4.0|Quickie report:<br /><br />Quality of songs on the album: 4/5<br /><br />Quality of the album as a whole: 2.5/5 - maybe 3<br /><br />Now to go into a little more depth...<br /><br />I don't usually listen to singles before an album is released because I like to hear an album in its entirety (at least once) before I give my opinion.  So when I heard the 30 second clips while waiting for the album to be available tonight, I was very scared.  I didn't think it sounded at all like Muse.  So I decided to see what I could find on youtube.  I found the official videos for Madness and The 2nd Law: Unsustainable.  I enjoyed Madness, but realized immediately that this was going to be a huge departure from The Resistance.  I was not impressed with TSL: Unsustainable.  The music is great, but where are the lyrics?  I'm not usually one to complain about something like that.  I LOVE instrumentals.  But it's not something I like Muse to do.  Lyrics and Bellamy's voice would have gone so well in that song.  Even if it was just a small portion of the song and mostly instrumental...<br /><br />Anyways, these 2 songs were so different from what I've come to love about Muse, that I still wasn't convinced I'd buy this album tonight.  So I sought out the album in it's entirety on youtube.  I listened to it, and my faith was recovered.  Some.  At least enough for me to buy the album and let the songs sink in more.  I really like some of the songs on this album, while others not so much, and even one song I find completely sub par (Liquid State) for Muse.  And unfortunately I found the last 2 tracks very anti-climactic without any lyrics.<br /><br />To sum up the album it has a lot of great individual tracks, but unlike The Resistance I don't feel they flow well together which is something I enjoy when artists can pull off.  I don't need the songs to fade out/into each other, but I really enjoy when the songs complement each other.  The tracks on this album don't give that feel.  That being said, I *applaud* Muse for trying new stuff.  I think it worked pretty well, but I think they just tried too much and the album *** as a whole *** suffered.g said, I *applaud* Muse for trying new stuff.

0671510991|5.0|Kissinger's review of international diplomacy is a deep and abiding analysis of what has happened in the western world since the 17th century and the beginnings of the European balance of power system.  Kissinger works toward the modern world of international interactions (his book was published in 1994) and America's role in forming and then surviving (so far) in this system.<br /><br />He explains the complex workings of the international order in fundamental terms.  For example, discussing the problems at Versailles, \\"European style diplomacy presumes that national interests have a tendency to clash, and views diplomacy as the means for reconciling them.  Wilson, on the other hand, considered international discord the result of 'clouded thinking,' not as an expression of a genuine clash of interests.\\"  Knowing this fundamental difference in world views it is much easier to understand the difficulties at Versailles.  This book is filled with this critical kind of information.  It is also filled with the Kissinger style of thinking.  First the overview, then an analysis of the detailed problem keeping the overview always in mind.<br /><br />I suggest reading On China after reading Diplomacy.  I read them the opposite way and I think I would have enjoyed On China even more if I had read this book first.<br /><br />AD2

630542845X|4.0|Fine, underrated film loosely based on/ripped off from Olaf Stapeldon's SF classic early novel ODD JOHN (available via Amazon, among other sources).  ODD JOHN is about an incredibly intelligent, not-like-us albino child and what happens to him and those around him as he matures.  POWDER is about an incredibly intelligent, not-like-us albino child and what happens to and those around him as he matures.<br /><br />That caveat/complaint aside, POWDER is a fine example of how to make a a science-fiction film that deals with ideas instead of smash-ups on a reasonable budget.  Excellent casting from the stars to the minor roles.  An intelligent human being, Jeff Goldblum gets to play an intelligent role, though I do get a bit tired of his singular stare-of-wonder from time to time (Director: \\"Jeff, it's okay to close your mouth once in a while\\").  Usual pro score by Jerry Goldsmith, right up there with his little-known work for BALTO.  Film gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of occasional plot contrivances that substitute story convenience for logic.  For example, both Goldblum and Mary Steenburgen's character quickly recognize Powder's exceptionalism, yet neither thinks to apply to take him home with them or otherwise find a proper venue for his maturation.  They can only repeatedly stick him in a home for boys that borders on the Dickensian, thereby jeopardizing his life and wasting his abilities.  In real (as opposed to cinematic) life, as soon as these abilities manifested themselves, Powder would find himself taken in and treated properly by the first university to be made aware of his uniqueness.  Instead, for dramatic purposes the plot is compelled to keep him stuck in a small Texas town.  There are additional breaks in logic that leave the viewer shaking their head...but are necessary for director Salva to hammer his point across to the viewing audience (and judging by some of the thick-headed negative reviews here he could have hammered twice as hard and certain viewers still wouldn't have got it).<br /><br />The acting and direction are a bit heavy-handed, but that's the conundrum faced by anyone wishing to make a science-fiction film about ideas.  Witness the first (negative) reviews of Kubrick's 2001.  The uncredited \\"borrowing\\" from Stapeldon aside, POWDER is well worth seeing.  Just as ODD JOHN, and all of Stapeldon's pioneering works, are well worth reading.iewers still wouldn't have got it).<br /><br />The acting and direction are a bit heavy-handed, but that's the conundrum faced by anyone wishing to make a science-fiction film about ideas.

B007B6VOG0|5.0|Almost everything about this album is perfect. The songs are great - theatrical and technical in the most artistic ways. The song writing is honest and sometimes heartbreaking, in both painful and beautiful ways. The songs all have unique sounds and almost all of them are good - It Gets Better is the weak link (to the point where I simply don't listen to it), but the rest of the album stands up so beautifully that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />Highly recommend this album. fun. is incredible!

B008C1O8CA|4.0|At twelve tracks and just over forty minutes, 2012's ![[ASIN:B008C1O8CA Uno]]!, the follow-up to 2009's Grammy-winning [[ASIN:B001SAQVDQ 21st Century Breakdown]], is a compact effort with no `filler.' Not all cuts are each other's equals, but no huge misses are present.  !Uno! Does not eclipse the band's rock opera masterpiece, 2004's [[ASIN:B0002OERI0 American Idiot]], but does restore their past sensibilities with lightening-speed tempo, pointed lyrics, and full commitment to punk-revivalist sensibility.<br /><br />\\"Nuclear Family\\" opens the effort tightly with driving guitars. Not quite the elite level set by say \\"American Idiot,\\" it holds its own. \\"Stay The Night\\"  contrasts \\"Nuclear Family\\" with a slower tempo (at first) before the entrance of drums accelerates the tempo.  The chorus is a highlight: \\"So say you'll stay the night/`cause we're running out of time/so stay the night/I don't wanna say goodbye...\\" \\"Stay the Night\\" remains consistent.<br /><br />\\"Carpe Diem\\" is succinct in duration, avoiding `dragging things out.' Armstrong commands, suited with excellent vocal production.  Background vocals enhance the chorus, dramatic by punk means: \\"Carpe diem, a battle cry/are we all too young to die...\\"  The songwriting favors punk idioms, meaning it complements the band's sensibilities.<br /><br />Cuts \\"Let Yourself Go\\" and \\"Kill The DJ\\" truly steal the show.  \\"Let Yourself Go,\\" incredibly uptempo, delivers a bite, not without a couple of f-bombs. Tr&eacute; Cool's pummeling drum groove foreshadows an invigorating ride in which Armstrong holds nothing back; The chorus is as angst-laden with Armstrong screaming on the latter half.  \\"Kill The DJ\\" remains highly charged, with Armstrong urging \\"Someone kill the DJ, shoot the ___ DJ... voices in my head are sayin' Shoot that ___down...\\" All this angst against a DJ-sensible funk-rock beat. Clever Green Day!<br /><br />\\"Fell For You\\" is solid, if slightly less catchy than the cuts it proceeds.  \\"Loss of Control\\" atones any ceded momentum, opting tempo the likes of the raw \\"Let Yourself Go\\".  Armstrong continues his angst-heavy attitude, uttering such lyrics as  \\"April Fool though you're falling love/but now you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face...\\" and \\"we're all crazy, you're all crazy now...loss of control.\\"<br /><br />\\"Trouble Maker\\" delivers a catchy pop-punk groove with the frontman taking a 'cutesy' approach on the verses.  The hook is bare bones simple (\\"Wanna be a troublemaker...\\"), but catchy. \\"Angel Blue\\" is solid, though by no means the second coming.  The songwriting is well structured, something that is notable throughout !Uno!. \\"Sweet 16\\" is catchy, if `two sweet' to counter the aggressive swagger of a cut the likes of \\"Let Yourself Go\\" or \\"Loss of Control.\\"  Penultimate cut \\"Rusty James\\" is solid, but doesn't ultimately `shape' the album.<br /><br />Promo single and closing cut \\"Oh Love\\" appears timely end &iexcl;Uno!'on a high note.' The songwriting is sound and Armstrong's vocally exceptional, particularly on the chorus: \\"Far away, far away/waste away tonight/I'm wearing my heart on a noose...tonight my hearts on the loose.\\" \\"Oh Love\\" may last five minutes, but it doesn't feel like it, which is a testament to its effectiveness.<br /><br />Overall, ![[ASIN:B008C1O8CA Uno]]! Is both solid and enjoyable. Green Day fans who did not care much for the bands `rock operas' will certainly enjoy this punk-rock roots effort.eded momentum, opting tempo the likes of the raw \\"Let Yourself Go\\".

B008C1O8CA|4.0|First of all, I am an avid fan of Green Day, and this album absolutely kicks!  The musicianship is excellent, and for the most part, the vocals are great.  My only fault with this album is the over-use of the 'f' word.  Now mind you, if the word adds something to a song, then so be it.  But when we continually add the word into areas where it's really not necessary just makes it seem tired.  I felt it was used more so for effect than to add to the songs.  Sure, Green Day is pissed and we get it.  But if punk is just the repitition of the 'f' word, then it doesn't mean much. Or maybe it's just that us older guys aren't as impressed by it's over-use as younger folks.
B007XIO9TU|5.0|I saw JOhnny Winter with the musicians on this DVD in June 2012. It was an amazng experience I will never forget; one of those life-altering experiences. The power, the energy, the raw yet fine-tuned and enormous talent invigorated the entire audience, no one escaped, or wanted to! This DVD has that same raw energy and makes me want to MOVE. I have watched it while runinng on the treadmill and gotten another 5 - 7 minutes of high speed running out of my work-outs when watching it. If you like the classic Texas Rockin' Blues, you will LOVE this DVD.

B008SVFX96|5.0|If you are looking for a great diverse album, well here it is folks. Richie has ensured his fans that this album is from his heart; seperating from the great band of Bon Jovi. Richie takes advantage of being \\"Boss\\" in order to share with fans his trials and tribulations from the past few years. The man truly brings it. This album brings out power sounds anywhere from the Foo Fighters to The Black Black Keys. \\"Burn That Candle Down\\" is rockin, a song that younger generations may appreciate due to the \\"Black Keys\\" feel. \\"Sugar Daddy\\" is one of my favorites; a fun song with catchy riffs with a stadium feel. \\"I'll Always Walk Beside You\\" is a moving song that professes dedication, inspiration,  and supportive measures to loved ones. Another one of my faves. \\"Seven Years Gone\\" gets into those trials and tribulations, a way to say \\"get back on your feet and do it\\". I love this song because it starts off very melodic and ends with the band rockin' out.<br /><br />I was leary at first with Richie's new album in regards to comparison to his previous solo albums.

B00932A2MC|5.0|This movie is well worth watching. It's got everything in it. Lots and lots of action, drama, suspense and romance.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|When I read the first book in the trilogy, I really liked it.  I decided that I would give the second book a try.  I am by no means a prude and did get some ideas from some of the scenes, but this book seemed to be the same thing over and over.  The interruption of all the erotica just delayed the progression of the story itself.  I think telling more of the story and throwing in less of the hooking up would've made it more interesting to me.

B00846REIS|3.0|This wasn't a bad book, but it could have been the 50 Shades books with a few of the same annoying repeated phrases. (Fisting his hands thru his hair).
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Purchased Kindle edition while on holiday... Couldn't put it down. As with all really good books, feel a bit depressed I finished it. Clearly the writer knows his European history of the inquisition and feudal period. A lot of similarities around the scheming of kings and religious fanaticism. Lends a lot of weight to the context of the book. For the price, you can't go past it if you like fantasy and some history themes thrown in. Now I have to find another good book... Damn.
1451662432|1.0|What is Arnold trying to accomplish with this new book?<br />Does he want adulation ... vindication maybe ... or is this an attempt at a new image?<br />If so - it's not working. Arnold's quintessential appeal came from his \\"Kindergarten Cop\\" persona.<br />He has blown that - it's gone.<br /><br />I may actually buy this book.<br />But if I do - it will not be for hero worship, or some sort of insight into California politics.<br />It will be a case study in how a man can do some really good things in life, and how he can also screw up royally. Arnold has done both.  THAT is a real-life lesson that I can learn from.<br /><br />I truly hope that Arnold gets on the road to real redemption.  It is possible for him.<br />But he needs to seek real faith ... and he needs to look for God.<br />He's not there yet.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not since Ernest Cline's Ready Player One have I been so impressed with an author (and kudos for self publishing AND BEING NOTICED!!!).  Hugh makes a universe out of a microcosm, guiding perspective one glimpse at a time.  Masterful progression through the 5 (more please!) installments, reading it as an omnibus was like watching full seasons of your favourite TV show as a box set.<br /><br />Now I'm just going to have to read everything he's written, and you should do the same.

B0086DBE62|3.0|It was a little weird for my taste on a classic fairytale. If it weren't for Nathan Lane I don't think I could watched the entire movie. The dwarves were OK. The prince was a little too wimpy for my tastes. Now I know why \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" was more successful. Costumes were defintely overkill.
B007IL59D2|3.0|I have read quite a few of P. Gregory's books from this period.  This one The Kingmaker's Daughter I found very repetitive.  I thought I would learn more about the period. This period and the Tudor times I find so interesting but I got a better picture from some other authors. I had read about Richard Neville and Richard 111 so I thought this book would add to my knowledge but as I said it seemed a bit naive and repetitive.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|This film makes the path that gasoline took to get to our tanks seem not so smooth as it depicts the hazards of the early oil trade.  The film allows the amazing Daniel Day-Lewis to embody in the character Daniel Plainview the type of man it takes to squeeze every drop of oil (meaning money and control) from the earth.  It is well to reflect that these qualities are key undercurrents of the whole American drama. Over against Plainview is the charismatic preacher, Eli Sunday, another type of power-seeker.  The story includes the image of Plainview, the materialistic businessman, being baptized by Sunday, undergoing this hypocrisy the better to pick the pocket of the simple church folk. All this is familiar as well.  The film is long but totally engrossing.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|The movie starts with Mohandas Gandhi, a lawyer, being thrown off of a train for being in the first class section even though he paid for first class because he was Indian and Indian was to be in third class per British law. Now in South Africa Gandhi decides that he will lead a non-violence protest with his great words of \\"They may torture my body, break my bones; even kill me. Then they will have my dead body - not my obedience.\\" After many protests the government finally sees that he is relentless and gives equal rights to the Indians as they do the British. Gandhi then goes back to India where he is famous for his work. He decides to fight for India's independence from the British Empire. After a long nonviolent on their end protest the British finally grant independence to India. Not too long after the Hindus and Muslims start feuding and Gandhi decides to protest the feud and put a stop to it by fasting until the feud has ended. The fighting did stop however the nation was divided into two halves. He then spends the rest of his life trying to put the two back together again. He tells the people that until they learn to stand as one nation they cannot have one India. All through his journey of teaching he has a Christian follower in which he accepts fully. While in prison he decides that he will wear nothing but a cloth covering his lower half. He then gets all of his followers to burn all of their clothes that are made from the British and ware very minimal clothes. He tries to get all the religions (Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, and Christian.) to come together and get their freedom. Gandhi is assented at the end of the movie but his work is not in vain for he is a great role model for generations after generations.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This entire series has always had me clinging to every word, the final book does not disappoint. Adventurous, wild, funny and last but not least moving as a whole. Read this book!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|As a huge Reacher fan, this was a huge disappointment. Extremely slow moving plot with way too much uninteresting detail of the mundane, characters that were much less interesting than in the past. Not near enough heroics by Jack, until the very end, and then way too \\"out there\\" and incredulous as the one-man-army against the bad guys that really went faceless for the most part. Lee Childs, you need to put some effort into your work in order to retain your fans.
B000NVT0RU|5.0|The film is set during the last years of World War II when North African soldiers joined France in fighting the Nazis through Italy and Provence but were mistreated by their bigoted French superiors.  French President Jacques Chirac, after watching Days of Glory, made a $190 million decision to restore full pensions to 80,000 North African troops.  Another gift of this film is positive images of Muslims, something of which we are starved in a West that lives with constant fear of Islamic terrorists.  We  seem to miscalculate hopelessly when dealing with the proud and extraordinarily brave races represented in the film.  For the French Algerians, Moroccans and Tunisians, the promised Days of Glory never really came.  Until this film.

1455502758|5.0|First let me mention that most of this book was already serialized in the VANITY FAIR magazine while he was still alive but going through cancer treatment. He lasted for a year and a half after his cancer diagnosis.  He kept writing and speaking as much as he could.  If you are a long time fan you probably already know this.  However, I mention it so that if you read everything in his VF series, you don't necessarily buy this in hard cover and discover it is pretty much the same thing.  However, if you want this in your library, as I did, then this is a small matter.<br /><br />Hitchens was always an excellent albeit controversial writer.  He loved nothing more than a good verbal fight and his public debates were very well attended.  Some of them are on dvd and are a separate delight. He had a wide range of interests and his knowledge is literature was beyond extensive.  Politics was also a hot topic for him.  Plus he loved taking on fair haired idols, such as Mother Theresa, firmly believing she did not deserve to be canonized as a saint.<br /><br />Perhaps this final effort is his best though because few people who are dying of cancer are able to write brilliantly about what they are experiencing.  I have had cancer and that did not turn me off these writings.  It made the series more compelling for me, not less.<br /><br />Personally I have known a lot of people willing to do a lot to stay alive with cancer but not anyone who did as much as Hitchens.  He relates having his entire genome sequenced as an effort to save his life. Of course he was also a very vehement atheist and some readers and listeners wanted him to burn in hell for that (quite vocally online) but that only adds to the story as well.<br /><br />I devoured every writing in his mortality series the instant it was published and am looking forward to rereading it all again.  In fact, I've already started and I recommend you do the same.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000QUCNOK|5.0|Perfume: the Story of a Murderer (based on Patrick Suskind's 1985 novel) begins in a squalid area of Paris 300 years ago when a woman selling fish gives birth to a child as she stands there and leaves it to die.  The poor bugger survives this as well as further abuse in an orphanage and as a work slave in a tannery.  His career as a murderer comes about because of his obsession with scent, particularly that of young women, which I imagine is related to his early deprivation.  The story becomes eerie and then weird and (believe it or not) funny and finally a dark myth.  It is one of the strangest and most satisfying films I have seen.  Tom Tykwer directed and participated in creating the script and the score.  Quite an achievement. Dustin Hoffman plays a character part, a famous perfumer.

B000P0J024|5.0|There seems to be a new resurgence of interest in 1970s music, particularly among today's 15 - 25 year olds. I grew up in the 70s and my friends' teenage sons and their friends are regularly asking me for recommendations of lesser known 1970s bands. They all know about Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd and the like, but they are not familiar with most of the lesser known 1970s bands.<br /><br />I recently told some of these young guys about the Traveling Wilburys and was surprised to hear they'd never heard of this band.<br /><br />The Traveling Wilburys were a collaboration between George Harrison (former Beatle), Jeff Lynne (former Electric Light Orchestra), Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan. These guys basically got together in the mid 1980s under the name \\"The Traveling Wilburys\\" and made a few albums just for fun.<br /><br />The results were excellent. It's unusual that five major talents could get together and produce some great music without any clash of egos and personalities getting in the way, but these guys did it.<br /><br />This compilation contains all the Traveling Wilburys recordings plus a DVD about the band. It's all great material. Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you like the work of any of the individual members of this band, you'll like this album.<br /><br />(OK, OK, the Wilburys recorded in the 1980s and I started off the review by writing about younger guys getting interested in 1970s music. Valid critique, but, in my defense, the guys in this band were all active in the 1970s.)
1451662432|1.0|By writing this autobiography, Arnold puts his ego ahead of the emotional well-being of his children and estranged wife.  Someone who commits adultery does his family no favors by talking about it in television interviews and books.  Did you all see him smile when recalling his affair with Brigitte Nielsen on 60 Minutes?  No remorse.  An arrogant man who does not need more of our money from book sales.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|Steven Wilson and Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, rightly concerned with the quality of the original lacklustre mix of Aqualung, set out see if improvements could be made to that mid-centric sound.  My concerns with the original mix (heard in the highest quality DCC gold CD edition in my opinion) centre around 3 things:<br />1. Rolled off bottom end (very little bass and kick drum).<br />2. The drum kit was also mixed too far back in general.<br />3. There is obvious tape damage throughout the title track manifesting as rapid and continuous treble drop outs.<br />Fear not, eager listeners. The above 3 faults have been corrected (and the only way they could have been, without repeating the Mobile Fidelity vinyl boom and tizz effort of many years ago - by a careful remixing)  and Aqualung can now be listened to without as many concerns for sound quality as before. Sure, it will never be a reference hi-fi disk, but it sounds wayyyyyy better than that DCC disk and at a fraction of the DCC price.<br />Thoroughly recommended!

B003VANOFY|4.0|I recently bought this as an upgrade to a gaming rig. The audio quality is excellent, the battery life is great, the software seems light years beyond competing software packages from other headset manufacturers, the wireless range is quite good and the extra buttons are fairly convenient. The one downside? - I found this headset wildly uncomfortable and I was unable to wear it for more than an hour. I returned it after a week and a half. My initial thought is that the what I was reacting to was the weight of the battery (this is wireless after all) but the headset I replaced it with was also wireless and is several orders of magnitude more comfortable. I can't put my finger on what it is but the memory foam just isn't as comfortable as it should be. Make sure to try one of these on before you buy it.

0307720950|4.0|\\"Makers: The New Industrial Revolution\\" by Wired's magazine Editor in Chief Chris Anderson, is his recently published book about the things we are able to build by ourselves in current time, empowered by desktop digital fabrication tools, and how this technologies might change the world.<br /><br />Proposing that a technology like 3D printing -- which is becoming increasingly cheaper, better, faster and omnipresent -- can change the world, and actually calling it a new industrial revolution might raise lot's of neck hair stand on end.<br /><br />But the author's experience as an editor and writer (I also recommend his two other books: the Long Tail about the rise of niche products and services in a mass market global economy, and Free, a book about how pricing schemes of $0 and giving thing away can still be a profitable business model) plays to his favour, crafting a coherent and enthusiastic discourse with enough back up stories to make it sound not only believable, but desirable as well.<br /><br />In his vision of the near future, or even more, our current present, home-brew manufacturing stands to revolutionise the American economy. Is he right about this?<br /><br />In 1776 the (first) Industrial Revolution replaced human power with machine power, thus amplifying human potential. Machines could take a simple gesture, or small physical effort from a person first, a water, steam, diesel or electrical machine later, and obtain faster results with less effort. \\"Things\\" could be built, but more to that, industries were born, both in the sense of a place with building facilities, and also in the economical terms of marketplace and trade.<br /><br />He proposes there's a second Industrial Revolution, the digital revolution of the late seventies and early eighties, with Personal Computers. Interestingly enough, he sets the date to 1985, when Apple released the LaserWriter printer as a Desktop Publishing platform, and not the release of the Personal Computers a few years before that.<br /><br />In that way, using the word Desktop (desktop computer, desktop publishing, desktop manufacturing) empowers industrial changes just presented democratising the tools of creation. Publishing quickly became the common thing on the web -- and the web became the common thing before that, so we \\"posted, uploaded, and shared\\" our way into this decade. Desktop technologies gave people tools of digital creation. Once attached to the network, the tools of distribution were democratised. Now we can do the same that big corporations could previously do, at least still in the digital trade.<br /><br />But does the same paradigm apply to 3D prints? And how?<br /><br />From that on -- he argues - it's not hard to see that the past ten years have been about finding new social and innovation models on the web, and the following ten are about getting things on the real world; \\"Atoms are the new bits\\" he said at a recent conference.<br />Today, it may seem as a simplified version of reality to just say that with access to digital fabrication tools, wether our own or in a Maker Space or FabLab \\"everyone with an idea, will have the tools to realise it\\", but it's a provocative thought, in the same line as in one of it chapter's title \\"we are all designers now, me might as well get good at it\\".<br /><br />What does it take to get all those ideas into the \\"real\\" world is what makes the difference, and \\"maker tools\\" make that process easy, however there is still a big leap to be made, and that is the gene of need finding and creation.<br /><br />Tools are just tools. It's how we use them that makes the difference.

1423140605|4.0|This is a very fun read.  I like it because it feels different enough from the other books. There's action - but not too much.  Instead we get to see the characters who were separted for so long kind of merge and the struggles that go with that.  There's a lot of drama relationship wise, and I know Percabeth fans will be very happy with this book because there are a ton of Percy/Annabeth moments.<br /><br />I also thought it was interesting seeing so many different views of Percy.  Of course we know him very well, but then you have Piper's view point who is like - well Jason is way hotter.<br /><br />And in this book we are FINALLY able to get to know Annabeth a lot more, even more than we did Percy in this book (which is kind of disappointing) I think her personality really shines.  In the Percy Jackson books we had Percy's POV of Annabeth, but Annabeth is a master at hiding her emotions.  She is a really complex person underneath that blonde hair, and I like that.  Plus, she really cares for Percy, and she has such a big burden that doesn't have such a simple solution which made for an exciting read.<br /><br />A problem I found with this book was that there were too many view points that didn't offer anything meaningful.  Piper is sort of just there, and more worried about her relationship.  Sadly, Percy also seems like a filler character.  He has some concerns  but I don't think his POV added much besides that.  Annabeth and Leo combined told the story well, and the thoughts of the other characters could've been told somehow through their chapters.  I almost wish Frank or Hazel also had a POV  but I suppose that's for the next book.<br /><br />What I really loved in this book were all the funny moments.  Leo is quickly becoming my favorite character.  He's likable in that Percy kind of way, but different enough with his own problems that it's not tiring.<br /><br />Overall a solid book.  As usual the wait for next year is going to be long and hard.

B001F9Y2CM|5.0|This Abba box contains the group's eight original albums and a bonus CD with non-album singles A's and B's. Besides the early B-sides, there are no really rare tracks. From the group's last sessions tracks like \\"I Am the City\\" and the still unreleased \\"Just Like That\\" are missing - would have been scoop if these songs had been included.<br /><br />As mentioned the bonus CD contains single tracks spanning a ten year period, and the significant development that the group went through taken into account, this CD comes out really incoherent. I think it would have been preferable if these numbers were allocated to the respective comtemporary albums.<br /><br />Otherwise there's obviously nothing wrong with the music, and if you do not absolutely need to have it all, but can settle for most of their recordings, this is a fantastic bargain.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|ob-ses-sion [uhb-sesh-uhn] - the domination of one's thoughts or feelings by a persistent idea, image, desire, etc.<br /><br />I'm starting off with a definition that serves as a warning.  Once you read this series, especially this book, you will develop an obsession for all things Gideon & Eva.  Their story leaps off the page, grabs you by the heart & mind and then deposits you firmly in the land of Crossfire addicts.  Don't worry, you are not alone.When I finished Reflected In You, I was overwhelmed by the emotions that it made me feel throughout - anger, sorrow, confusion, hurt, joy, hope & love.  They were all over the place, as was the story.  It is a book that, for me, is completely hard to describe.  It is about nothing, but everything.  It is full of so much hurt, but love dominates.  It is full of confusion, but makes perfect sense.  I was engulfed in the story and literally could not put the book down until I was done.<br /><br />TRUST.  After I  read every single compelling scene and asked myself, what is the point?  What end result did Ms. Day want with this book?  My answer was simply - trust.  Eva & Gideon need to learn to trust each other if they are ever hope to move on from the land of insecurity, jealousy & betrayal that they constantly live in.  After suffering the horrors of their past, that is not an easy accomplishment.  Gideon uses control, instead of trusting, to get what he wants.  In the end, the decisions that he makes, only end up hurting Eva & destroys what little trust she has.  She then retaliates because of the hurt, and in turn, destroys Gideon's trust.  It is such a vicious cycle and, at times, was very hard to read, especially in the second half.  When you see that trust finally coming to fruition, it is absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Be prepared to have some questions answered and more asked, there is a lot that goes on in this book. Gideon's past is finally revealed and it helped me understand his need for control.  It is heartbreaking, but also one of my favorite parts of the book.  I love that Eva stands up to the people that she feels wronged him, even before she knew the details.  Two people from Eva's past make their presence known by causing trouble, minor & major.  We finally get to meet Eva's Father (which I loved) and witness the interaction between her parents, I saw sparks flying  .  Carey is trying to get his life on track when something major happens that is pivotal to the storyline, you won't find out how pivotal until the end.<br /><br />This was a phenomenal read and one of my favorites of the year!  Reflected In You was an emotional roller-coaster that made me want to close my eyes, scream and, most importantly, ride all over again!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|you can hear the songs very well. it is also fey easy to download songs onto a kindle fire. I enjoy this app
B009CPIR9K|1.0|I'm not sure if I can articulate how bad this movie is, but I will try. So you've probably seen the trailers for this, just like I have. Nazis from the moon, dirigibles, guns, explosions, satire, Sarah Palin--ripe with comedic potential! Unfortunately Iron Sky didn't deliver on anything that, well, on anything at all really. We have a very sinusoidal and ultimately anti-climactic storyline, boring characters, unfunny jokes, and a lame space battle at the end that you could've just fast-forwarded to and not missed a single thing. This movie had so much potential, but it fails to deliver on any one item. I'm often left wondering what I'm supposed to be watching. Is it a serious space opera? No wait, it's a satire. No wait, it's space noir. I really, really wanted to love this movie. I saw the terrible reviews for this movie before I bought it. But if you're like me, you'll want to watch it anyways and judge for yourself. I suggest you don't get your hopes up.
B0046BI82G|4.0|I got these for my husband, and he said he'd give them a 4. He said the action and special effects were good. I personally thought there were too many cuss words in them, but he said that part was okay. All in all, they were good action movies.
B007AYJ3JI|4.0|THIS VIDEO WAS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL HAPPY FEET. IT DIDN'T HAVE THE SORT OF SUSPENSE AS THE FIRST  FRANK MILLER
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|A very good romantic movie  a must see especially if you are in love, Olin Wilson superb in this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It could be better It should have a setting to make it a scientific calculator. Also DONT HATE ON MY REVIEW!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|it honestly is the most addictive app I have! I use it on my computer&amp; kindle&amp; my phone! it is an absolute necessity!  helps with everyday life!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Very cute movie. I didn't watch it but my children (6, 6 & 3) did & I sort of listened in while doing dishes, etc. Real cute. My husband got very engrossed in it lol So I would say it is for the kid in all of us ;)(that don't have dishes to do :D
0062082353|3.0|First I want to say that I have the deepest respect for our troops and I read this book because I'm intrigued by the Navy SEALs. This book reads like a wartime diary and not a story. It is very vague and disjointed as if an editor never read it before being published (even though the author thanked his editor). The insights provided by his wife helped the book tremendously, but they were often interjected into topics where they seemed completely out of place and unrelated. This reads like a cheap attempt to capitalize on the success of Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell.<br /><br />Lone Survivor is a much better read as it was co-written by a professional writer and a much more interesting story that goes beyond someone simply telling you how good they were at their job.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have just finished the last of the trilogy and enjoyed each one.  I look forward to reading additional books by Suzanne Collins.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Probably the best game I've played on my Fire!  Interesting plot, great graphics, long game (you actually get your money's worth!)
B008G12ERC|4.0|It's three years since `The Resistance' and while the follow up, `The 2nd Law' lacks one of those barnstorming Muse epics which seem to define the band, the new record is arguably their most consistent batch of songs to date. `The 2nd Law' showcases a lot of the three-piece's strengths, and with a variety of styles experimented with across the 13 track LP, there's plenty for fans, new and old, to sink their teeth into. From the funk rock of Panic Station to the delicacy of Madness, or from the sporadic electronics of Unsustainable to the poignancy of Save Me, it offers a rich and diverse album which promises ample reward upon each re-listen.<br /><br />Supremacy (8.5/ 10)<br />It is a bombastic, huge start, giving the album its injection of grandiose stadium rock (along with Survivor). A filthy, swanky riff opens the track before making way for a flurry on the strings. At times the song borders on Muse's answer to a James Bond theme, but it's got enough panache and swagger to make it a strong opening statement. Minus 1.5 for not having Sean Connery on guest vocals.<br /><br />Madness (9.5/10)<br />Second single and possibly the best songs on the album. It's pretty experimental, and a slow smouldering tune, but it's strangely enchanting, and the guitar solo has Brian May written all over it. Chilled, unusual, awesome.<br /><br />Panic Station (8.0)<br />A change of pace as Matt and Co. all go a bit Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Some funky base, some shimmery, summery guitars, and I think it contains the first f-bomb on a Muse album track. What's not to like?<br /><br />Prelude<br />Not too much to say but it sets the terrain nicely for...<br /><br />Survival (9.0)<br />If you can get passed the intro-melody sounding like the start of `Food Glorious Food' from Oliver Twist, this is another huge track. It builds brilliantly with some piano and choir backing vocals. Add another Brian May-inspired riff (think Queen's `Innuendo'), lyrics about winning, and a loud chorus, and you have a song fit for the Olympics.<br /><br />Follow Me (7.5)<br />The album enters a bit of a lull after the scintillating start, but there's still enough amongst the synth and dance beat to keep you entertained. It is musically quite an upbeat track, discussing the topic of protecting someone you love.<br /><br />Animals (6.0)<br />The worst song on the album. It seems a bit low on energy and invention. Some quite bluesy guitars and not much else dominate the song. It just appears to be starting to kick off when it ends.<br /><br />Explorers (7.0)<br />Seems to be heavily influenced by Thom Yorke. Dreamy and slow moving with piano and strings, it has a pretty bridge but sounds like a safe, slightly less inspired version of Madness; it isn't offensive to the ears by any means though.<br /><br />Big Freeze (8.0)<br />The album starts to pick up again with this inspirational bad boy. With great, up-beat guitars, it has some U2 influences and lyrically is really well constructed; it concerns trying to save an increasingly problematic relationship.<br /><br />Save Me (8.5)<br />I wasn't sure about this one until I read it was written about Chris's struggle with alcoholism. It's asking for his family to support him and help him through the tough times. It builds beautifully and the topic makes it really poignant. \\"Run away and take me with you, don't let go I need your rescue.\\" The guitars in the bridge are really cool, and the song, both instrumentally and lyrically. effectively conveys the personal nature of the issue.<br /><br />Liquid State (9.0)<br />Another song Chris wrote about his struggle with alcoholism, but in a completely different musical vain from its predecessor. It's a hard rock song specifically about his battle against drinking, it's an unexpected twist but works really well and adds a darker element to the album.<br /><br />The 2nd Law: Unsustainable (9.0)<br />The strings in the opening conjure great urgency and the idea of catastrophe brilliantly.This sets the way well for the speech on unsustainability, linked to the title of the album. I personally like the crazy robotic stuff that goes on afterwards as I think of it as a highlighting of the random, uncontrollable progression of technology, whether we want it or not. But I know it wasn't universally welcomed when it first appeared in the video for the song on Youtube.<br /><br />The 2nd Law: Isolated System (8.0)<br />The last track sounds a lot like Mike Oldfield's `Tubular Bells', with some scrambled news stories played underneath the music. It is quite sinister and eerie. A mostly instrumental finale meant to leave you in a thoughtful mood, and it succeeds.<br /><br />Overall: 8/10<br />(If you liked my review please follow my music-based twitter page @2ndHandNoise . Thanks!)
B003719GGS|5.0|This is a must read for any man in a relationship whether you are married or not and especially for those like myself that have been married for 20+ years! Dr. Chapman does an excellent job of writing this from a man's perspective so that we can easily understand the opposite sex and how to figure out their love language. While I would like to think that my wife and don't have that many problems, after 28 years its easy to get in a rut, doing the same things day in and day out and forgetting what it really takes to make a good marriage even stronger. I owe a big thanks to my wife for suggesting that we read the book together, wish we had done it years ago!
B003O86FMW|4.0|These are really well written books.  I just finished the last of the trilogy.  Look forward to reading additional books by Suzanne Collins.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Good Visual effects. Charlize Theron was great! Not a fan of Kristen Stewart, but she was good too. Overall it was a good movie, and a bit different adaptation of the story. Worth watching!
B00992CF6W|2.0|it won't. install I keep pressing. install but it says error please try again. later please help help help help help help help help
B00005ABTT|3.0|The movie itself is good enough.  What I didn't understand was that Region 2 means that it's from another country and cannot play on my DVD player, but it can play on my computer after I adjust the settings.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Just about every album MUSE puts out sounds different from each other. This one is no exception. There are progressive rock and dubstep influences. If you love MUSE, you'll love this new album as it still has that MUSE musicality. Though, I really hope this is their last album that tries to sound like Queen on some tracks.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Love this game, cant wait till the continuation of it.  Hope it comes out soon .....I really like bigfish. good price too....
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Witches, ghosts, vampires and yes, even a werewolf (spoiler) this movie does have it all. Sly and subtle humor rules the day with splashes of the obvious but keeps the story line moving along. The actors chosen for their roles could not have been more perfect. Even the crowd scenes were filled with interesting faces so keep an eye out for them. Also, the Collins mansion. Pay attention to the little details. In general, it is a fun movie to watch. Not heavy handed, humor is there and a great way to spend your time. If your expecting it to be like those other movies you will be disappointed. If you like this type, you might like an oldie called Love At First Bite.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Where is she going with this....<br /><br />There were so many times while reading this book that I kept thinking where is Ms Day going with this.  I really deep down knew that Gideon wasn't being dodgy...but couldn't he do this without making me want to cry.<br /><br />I still can't decide which of the two books I liked better, but I think I will wait until entwined comes out to make my final judgement.<br /><br />All my favourite characters were back and I think she did a good job of reminding us of what happened in the first book (which I didn't need, as I reread Bared on Sunday).<br /><br />Great book, can't wait for December.  Keep up the good (HOT AND STEAMY) work.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great game, really enjoyed the challenge.  It took me several long days to finish.  I hope they continue to make more of these games.
0385344333|1.0|I'm sure someday I will finish it, but I was so zonked out by the excruciating minutae--and I'm a big fan of the author--but it was just too hard to continue reading so I stopped within about 60 pages...So sorry, Mr. Child.  I shall still await the next Reacher novel, I won't give up yet.  Incidentally, I got it cheaper at Wal-Mart.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game so much so I have little time for my other apps. It's fun but be prepared to be challenged.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I'm addicted to pinterest. The app occasionally does act up and kicks me out but not that often. Lots of great ideas for kids home and health.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was a fantastic read!  I was initially interested because of all the controversy surrounding its release, but was pleasantly suprised at how good it actually was.  I couldn't put it down and that's very rare for me.
B0035JRVBO|4.0|Our whole family enjoys this movie it just makes you feel good ... such a strong male role model preformed my tom hanks in an unlikely soul as forrest gump is childlike and disciplined in his simple yet complex life story...
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|I have been waiting it seems like an eternity to see what happens and it was worth the wait.  Regina seems like she is in trouble, the seven dwarfs are upset,-not just grumpy,and Mr.Gold is- well you must watch it.  Believe you me, it was worth the wait.
0385344333|1.0|So looking forward to this book, i was bored with it after the first chapter...has Reacher turned into a wimp with age?<br />I never thought i would say this about a Lee Child book, but it should never have been written , will not be paying out for his next Reacher novel.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|the game is only a demo that stinks controlles are set up weard the game froze only three cars are avaliable
1400052181|5.0|This nonfictional story is incredibly controversial in medical and ethical practices, even for today!<br />In short, read it! It makes you think about certain aspects of medical treatment and ethics, or even writing this story and no proceeds to the family, is controversial.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I found myself a little bored and playing on my phone rather than watching the movie.  Visually a great movie but found the story line a little predictable but I guess that's because of the fairy tale simularity
B00932A2MC|4.0|Fun movie! Very entertaining with action, romance, good vs evil and a big surprise with Eric (favorite vampire from True Blood). It is not thought provoking, but fun!!!!
B008G12ERC|3.0|This album definitely showcases Muse as a band who is in the midst of redefining itself. They try a lot of new stuff. Some works, but a lot does not. I would rank this album as their weakest, a smidgen below The Resistance. My biggest problem with it is that I don't find myself wanting to sing along with a majority of the songs like I did with earlier albums such as Absolution and Origin of Symmetry, or even The Resistance. The 2nd Law starts off strong but the majority of the second half of the album is filled with garbage like Follow Me and Big Freeze. I appreciate Chris Wolstenholme's two songs (Save Me and Liquid State) but I don't consider them Muse songs. They would've worked much better on something separate like a solo album and only add to the unevenness of this album. There is one song I absolutely love on this album (you have no soul if you don't agree) and that song is Panic Station. Put it on repeat and just try not finding yourself grooving to it by the 3rd listen. This album is a worth a buy just for that song alone.<br /><br />In the end, it's a very flawed album with some good songs but not enough to justify it more than a C grade at best.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my fiance, we both love the godfathers, and these are amazing! He was so happy. We sat and watched them all in one sitting!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|It is a great game with a grey concept. But...<br /><br />I logged out of my account and tried to start a new one. I had just written my new password down, and I logged in... but I thought I had the wrong password! Everything was lost!
143911000X|1.0|Look, I will be the first to say that How I Met Your Mother is a problematic show.  It has its great moments filled with love and heart, but much of the humor relies on belittling other human beings.  This book is a disgusting caricature of misogyny, a treatise on how to treat women like objects, not human beings.  Sickening.  I realize that Barney is meant to be this over the top character who says this stuff, and you're supposed to just write it off as Barney being Barney, but this stuff is damaging in a society like the one we inhabit.  We read this stuff and just brush it off, but it gets internalized.  This book is not okay.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I really enjoyed rewatching this series. Originally I had watched it on Hulu while it was still running on tv, and having enjoyed it so much I purchased the season 1 through pre-order. And I've enjoyed it equally as much the second time round.<br /><br />For anybody who loves creepy flics and series, this one is excellent. Not to mention some excellent plot twists.<br /><br />I already can't wait for season 2 to air...<br /><br />As far as the dvd product itself: It's perfectly fine. I'm not usually the type to go through extras and whatnot so I can't say anything there, but the dvd's work and for me that's all that matters. :)
B009329ZF2|4.0|More and more movies leave a lot to be desired. This one although it is far fetched is action packed and actually has some new ideas. Plus seeing CWIS in action is always awesome.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|I watched all of this series as it was aired on TV year after year.  I enjoyed it immensely always laughing out loud at some of the messes these wives (characters) could get themselves into.  When it went off the air I decided it was something I would watch again so I started to buy the DVDs.  Great series and I won't go into analyzing the ups, downs and sideways writing of the show but just give it a 5 star rating and say I'm glad to own all of the DVD's.  After I finish watching all the seasons this time, they will get filed away and probably pulled out in a couple of years to watch again and once again have a good laugh.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app. just another way to promote my website in social media. fast loading and great pics to view. love it.
B008I3R2VG|3.0|I miss the Killers from the Hot Fuss and Sams Town album.  I guess I was expecting more from a album title Battle Born.  First, after playing hours of Skyrim and thinking...maybe a homage to the dragon born but it's not.  The album title you can find on the state flag of Nevada.  Did  not know that, thank you Killers for leting me learn about Nevada History.  Still, I was expecting more from a title called battle born. You would think with a name and awesome album cover that it would rock, right.  Not!  I got lured in with song Runaways.  I'm thinking, great the Killers got their balls back, I guess I was wrong.  Runaways is a good song, but it's not the sound of the rest of the album, it just tells the concept of the story of some dude.  Anyways, the song Here with me, sounds like a 80's cheesy rock ballad ripoff.  It's cheesy cause of onw word...cellphone.  Unlike other reviews, I do like the song the Rising Tide.  Its like the prelude of Midnight show.  Imagine neon lights, night time, atmosphere, that a great song.  Prize Fighter should have been on this album.  Anywasys, I was disapointed with this album and wanted more guitar and rock sound like the song Runaways.  I can say at least it was not like there album before.  I will still see them live if they do more tours in the State.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Train totally has changed from their \\"old\\" music.  I remember being in love with Train in high school with drops of jupiter and meet virginia then they dropped off the radar until recently.  This album is much more mainstream pop than any of their prior stuff however it still has some fun lyrics and the imagery to go along with all the lyrics is great.  My favorite has to be \\"50 ways to say goodbye.\\"  If you are looking for a fun youtube video watch the music video [...]
B0083SBMBM|1.0|Our family saw and loved the movie at the theatre back in May or whenever, so my son really wanted it for his birthday.  We pre-ordered the movie from Amazon.  We paid $2.99 shipping to get it here, so you'd think that Amazon would try to get it to us at least close to the release date.  Instead they don't even get it to our town until Friday 9/28 and it doesn't make it to our mailbox until 4PM on Saturday.  I'd been tracking the package for days and the tracking said FedEX, however the DVD turns up in our locked USPS box.  I'd been looking for the thing for two days on my porch, and FedEx apparently ran it over for the Post Office to deliver (losing a day)...How am I supposed to know that?  I had given up on the delivery by that point so we didn't get the movie until Monday.<br /><br />In the meantime, I walked past other copies at Target, Meijer, Best Buy...probably for the same price (especially considering shipping).<br /><br />For my patience Amazon has graciously refunded 3 cents back for the pre-order.  What is my incentive to pre-order a movie with you folks in the future?  It's not price or delivery apparently.
034580404X|5.0|The condition of the books were great and im really enjoying them a lot. Overall great product I will be ordering more product in the near future
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books! A must read again and again...looking for my fifty shades lol would really love to read the whole trilogy from Christian's perspective.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Incredibly well written, great characters, plot development, and an awesome sci-fi premise.  The writing is very good, and Howey does a great job of grabbing the reader's interest and pulling him into the action in the silo.  I really enjoyed this book.  Great stuff!
0316228532|1.0|As magical and adventurous the characters  in The Harry Potter books were, the characters in this book are the exact opposite.  Only their  dark side is shown.  In this whole  set of villagers,  there's not  one redeeming value presented.  It is probably well written,  but I couldn't see the forest from the trees.  I listened to it, and there is just unrelenting darkness.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I had heard it was a very visual movie but was surprised by the good acting of an excellent cast. Enjoyed seeing this version of an age old story.

B007UPNA6Y|5.0|An xcellent read well up to what is xpected from Lee Child and his Jack Reacher novels. Looking forward to the next novel
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I was a fan from day one of the original series. We used to run to the west side of Manhatten to the studio where they filmed the show after the show ended at 4 30. We went to greet the stars comming out of the studio. For many years Jonathon Frid would do readings in my neighborhood at the Yorkville Library. ( RIP Mr. Frid). I have loved every incarnation from the movies of the 70's to the revival and now even most of the new version. Nay sayers have knocked all versions ( House of Dark Shadows , Night of D S , and the new one) since the original show because of severe differences . I want to remind true fans of the original series ,that the show went into stories in paralell time.Think of the movies and newer versions as wonderful journeys into paralell time and just enjoy and know that we still have Dark Shadows after nearly 50 years ( since 1966 ). I for one hope Depp and Burton stick to their plans of a trilogy and we see 2 more films. Thomas Gordon, Manhatten NYC
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I highly recommend these books. Quick easy read and you won't want to put them down! If you don't like these books you are crazy!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I didn't give it five stars because I find it addicting. I prefer it to regular solitaire and am happy the ads are minimal.
B0041LG08U|4.0|I have this watch for over month now. This is very nice looking watch. It keeps time nicely way more accurate than my Tissot automatic watch. You would love the style if you are into dive watch style. Very easy to read time at day or night.<br />The bracelet is a bit noisy which feels a bit cheap, and I wonder if you can just upgraded to something that not chuckle.<br />The bezel is a bit too lose for my test in a sense that it will move without you noticeably turning it.<br />Those are the only shortcoming of this watch.<br />If you are in the market for diving watch on a budget this is probably the best value out there.

B004TI5N38|5.0|I started this book in the afternoon and couldn't put it down until I turned the last page!  Baldacci has done it again.  I have read all of his books and have never been disappointed.     If you love suspense and a story with surprising twists and fast turns, read this book and all of the others.
0525953728|5.0|Very detailed account of a major historical event.  This books speaks of the determination, grit, physical prowess and driven desire that is required for an individual to become part of an almost mythical unit of the United States Navy.<br />The author goes into great detail about the preparation and training of an individual in the Army's elite Team 6.<br />It tells of the development of the author's Naval career. How a young man's dream culminates in the one mission that gripped the world's attention because of its objective, which was to capture (or kill) the author of  the first  major terrorist attack on national territory.<br />He is careful not to divulge any sensitive information while describing events.<br />You can get an additional sense of the personality of the author of \\"No Easy Day\\" in a video of his interview promoting the book that may be watched on \\"60 Minutes\\".<br />He brings a personal touch to the characters involved in the mission and once you become familiarized with the military acronyms it is an easy read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ms. Day - somehow you have written characters that have caught my attention and my heart. This is a great second part of Gideon and Eva's story.  I woke up at midnight last night to read this book.  I CANNOT wait to read the end of Gideon and Eva's love story.  December 31 cannot come quick enough.<br /><br />Reflected in You - stays very true to the original novel. Gideon and Eva's actions while crazy for a \\"normal\\" person feel real and believable based on what we know about their pasts.  They continue to deal with past abuse and their relationship's growth feels authentic. The novel is filled with heart breaking moments, but there is also loving and joyous scenes throughout.  I laughed, I cried and I am already re-reading the novel.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this novel. What a work of art!
B000ICXQHE|5.0|great story line, multiple twist and turns. Denzel washington, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, and Clive Owen did their normal great jobs.

B0098VXBIA|2.0|My wife made me watch this horrible movie.  Was poorly acted and a complete bore.  I dont understand why anyone would want to watch this type of movie.
0316113506|5.0|I bought this book 4 years ago but first in the past week I got time to start reading this book, but then already the first sides caught my interest, so that I used all of my following possibly time to continue reading in it. Because already in the \\"Introduction\\" it among other was thought-provoking to read about the students from Naperville, and their results in TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) back in 1999.<br /><br />Each morning I as the first ting in the day start on 25 - 30 minutes gymnastic (having 25 C = 77 F), but after reading this book I've found this more important than I previously knew, and also learned that it help different depending of how much the heart is working in percent of the optimum (and even between men and women to choose different %). That is which part in the brain that is rebuild and increased dependent of how hard the exercise is.<br /><br />But even though I owe many books concerning the brain I would still like very much if there also in this book was a couple of drawings showing the positions in the brain which are mentioned in the text.<br /><br />But I wonder why on side 220 it is written \\".., and high cholesterol increases the risk 43 percent.\\", and beside mention that the age, and being man or women also influence. This because among other we in the book by Robert W.Freeman, M.D.: \\"The Harvard Medical School Guide to Lower Your Cholesterol\\", we get a quit different statement. In this book, when calculating the risk for developing heart disease in the next ten years, we for example have that for a women in the age 20 to 39, if the total cholesterol level is bigger than 280 it results in a number 13 to use in the calculation, opposite to only number the 2 for a women in the age 70 - 79. That is higher age is allowing higher total cholesterol.<br /><br />But all together an excellent book, with many interesting details and cases, concerning the cases just to mention the writing on page 60 about the shipyard workers in Baltimore who through years got some radiation on each working day, and statistically showed up to live longer.yard workers in Baltimore who through years got some radiation on each working day, and statistically showed up to live longer.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack was so patient in this one, he didn't head butt,break an arm,or kill anyone until at least half way through. Clueless as he was he kept his cool until he had to save the country and pull the FBI counter terrorist Lugs out again. This kept me guessing all the way along. What a tangled web he got caught in! The Best but all have been great!

B00846REIS|3.0|Not all that great.  The 50 Shades series were definitely better.  This book seems as if the author read 50 Shades and quickly threw together a copycat version.  Lots of sex without the bondage issues of 50 Shades.  The characters even seemed to be very much like Ana and Christian from 50 Shades.  Was disappointed in this book.

B0083EW97W|5.0|After a few disappointing albums, this album made me fall in love with John Mayer again. It even made me go back and give Continuum and Battle Studies a new listen, and I appreciate those albums in new ways. One of my favorites are Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey. My heart breaks when he says: \\"The only deal I ever signed/No devil drew a dotted line/The stage was set, the words were mine/I'm not complaining.\\" But, I almost feel like he is. I feel like, he thinks he never got to truly express his true self, what was deep in his core, but instead churned out pop hits (beloved though they are.) But, now I feel as if he's truly found himself. Welcome back John. I hope YOU stick around for years to come :)
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Help, love the game, but apparently lit the code on the big rock in the wrong order. I cant fix my mistake and i cant move forward. I am so close to the end, is there anyone who knows how to get past this. its been a fun game otherwise.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Horrible. The effects are terrible, Ryan Reynolds is dead wrong for the part, Blake Lively's performance is embarrassing, and most of all --<br />this movie is so stupid, everyone involved with it should be ashamed.<br /><br />Paul Sheer, the comedian said it well: \\"Watching the Green Lantern movie is like being cornered at a party by a horrible Green Lantern fan as he explains Green Lantern to you for three hours, mouth breathing Cheetos breath in your face.\\"<br /><br />EVERYONE  at DC Comics and Warners who's responsible for this debacle should be fired. Marvel is making The Avengers, DC/Warners is firing Joss Whedon from Wonder Woman and making this 250 million dollar turd. Fire them all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was cute , heartwarming, and one of those stories where you can easily root for the underdog. No pun intended. I've been recommending it to all of my friends who read books and love animals.
B007SO31BQ|2.0|I can't get the disc to play!  Error message said my PS3 needed update before disc would play.  So far, I haven't connected my PS3 to Internet, now I have to, in order to view this movie....frustrating.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|The Dark Knight Returns is fantastic. Great cast, great pace, it looks good -- and it captures the graphic novel very well. Yes, there are a few minor changes, but they all work. The Mutants and Robin are really translated well, and Weller is perfect.<br /><br />DC Warners animated films range from really good (Mask of the Phantom) to not-so-great (Green Lantern) -- I think this is the best one they've done.<br /><br />I very much look forward to part two -- bring on Clark Kent!
B0098R6M1M|4.0|You have to understand the gravity of the apostolic line to grasp the depth of one man's struggle to do what he is capable of doing, which might surprise some.  This film is definitely worth an hour or so of your time.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|Bad writing, entertaing subject. Dom&Sub. I could have found better written books on the subject if I'd not been lazy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Ripped from today's headlines...wife goes missing...husband number 1 suspect.  What really happened and why?<br /><br />I was caught up from the very beginning. By the end of Part One, I'd already decided what was going on.  Then in Part Two I was drawn in deeper and reminded that not all is what it seems. Part Three didn't end as I would have written it but, it was still believable and kept in line with the tone of the book.<br /><br />All of that to say, the book is well written and the characters were written well enough to be believed.  Some are more likable than others.  If you are looking for a good way to spend some time, I would recommend this book.  It's a quick yet complex read.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While the series is poorly written, I loved it for entertainment value.  It was truly a work of fan fiction (Twilight Series).
030758836X|4.0|It was love at first sight for Nick and Amy Dunne. They fell madly in love, had a whirlwind romance and, when we meet them at the beginning of this book, it is the day of their 5th wedding anniversary, and they are anything but in love.<br /><br />This is a story of a marriage gone horribly wrong. The first 19 chapters or so are devoted to Nick and Amy's tortuously long-winded journal. Here is where Flynn lays the background for the unraveling that happens later. I almost stopped reading the book entirely during this first phase because quite honestly, the journals were so boring and tedious to read through. However, now that I've finished the book I realize that the laying down of that foundation was crucial to the success of the novel.<br /><br />Be warned, things are not as they appear. Just like her characters, Flynn is leading us on a wild goose chase the entire time, playing with us and using us the same way the characters are using each other. This whole book is one big, twisted game and we're thrown right into the mix as its unwilling players.<br /><br />The language is as gritty as the characters; there are \\"F\\" bombs galore, as well as explicit sexual references, but the language and the sex do not distract from the plot; as a matter of fact, (and this is coming from someone who distains such inclusions) I felt they enhanced the story. These are the types of characters who tell it like it is - no holds barred. They are smart, sassy, caustic, and very transparent. These are the type of people that HAVE to curse in order to tell their outrageous stories. It would be a watered down, joke of a book if they didn't.  So please don't let the fact that they do so prevent you from reading this book...just go along with it - it's worth the effort.<br /><br />I have to say that this is the craziest book I've ever read, but after all is said and done, I enjoyed it. Yes, it's dark, gritty, wild and insanely unbearable at times, but that's what makes it so good. The only thing I didn't like was the ending; compared to the rest of the book it was rather anticlimactic. Nevertheless I recommend this read wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Enjoy.thing I didn't like was the ending; compared to the rest of the book it was rather anticlimactic.

0385340540|2.0|Normally, I'm a big fan of Grisham, and I must admit that the book is masterfully written. However the various plots just could not exist in the real world. CIA killing an American adviser to the President? NOT going to happen. Additionally, Grisham just doesn't get the conversation inside Washington at the time the book was written. The CIA was fighting for its life against politicization (and failing in several instances). The DIA was constantly entering fabrications into the matrix. The Cheney administration was good at drawing solid lines between imaginary points, using false intelligence vetted by DOD.<br /><br />No, while I normally like Grisham's work, the alleged facts in the book just don't jibe with the real world. I do offer 2 stars to the master storyteller, but he needs to dig a lot deeper to get to reality.<br /><br />Sometimes the truth can be stranger than any fiction.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|I knew this movie had an UltraViolet Digitally Streaming Copy, but I didn't care because I wanted the DVD for my collection. I also know how to convert the DVD into my own digital copy which WILL play anywhere. 5 stars because the movie is awesome, but subtract 2 stars for the UltraViolet copy. Also, I hate these new, flimsy, \\"eco\\" DVD cases. Bring back the old, sturdy DVD cases.

B007SGM084|1.0|My mother wanted to read these books after a friend told her about them, so she borrowed my Kindle to buy and read them.  I had heard all the hype and criticism about the books, so out of curiosity I looked them over and found the writing was awful.  In fairness, I didn't actually read the books, but that was because the parts I did read were either boring, absurd, or poorly written.  I'm totally fine with the adult subjects, but sex alone cannot make a book worth reading.  I'd look elsewhere if you are interested in erotic fiction.  Having said all this, when I asked my mother (who actually read them) what she thought, she damned it with faint praise: \\"Eh, it was OK, I guess...but I don't recommend you bother reading it.\\"
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|The \\"Lumineers\\" have a unique style. Their video of this song grabbed me, and the CD is just as fine! Highly recommend.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|The music is great, no question on that.<br /><br />The CD however... it appears to have been over painted in white making it near impossible to read the actual CD.  Also the album information appears to be for \\"The Vaccines\\" \\"Come of Age\\" album, at least with Windows Media Player.
0199270295|5.0|Since its appearance in 2001, \\"Clayden\\" is clearly the best book that undergraduates can acquire for their preparation in Organic Chemistry. This piece of art continues its hegemony in the second edition, so there is no point in comparing this book with other books actually in the market (that's the reason for 5 stars). Therefore, this review focus on comparisons between the first and second edition.    Main changes:    1) The main change in the new edition deals with the order of topic presentation. Clearly, the new order is better, and more logically fluent. For example, conjugate addition is now grouped with nucleophilic aromatic substitution.  Each chapter ends with a \\"further reading\\" section which was so much in need. These changes would be greatly valued by teachers.    2) some chapters that appeared in the 1st ed are not included in the printed version of the 2 ed, however, it should be clear that these chapters still exist and every owner of the new edition have access to then via the companion web site    3) the problems section at the end of each chapter is no longer included in the printed version, they are included in the companion web site.    4) Only few discussions were rephrased with only modest enlargement of some discussions and deletion of others. This can be seen for example in the chapter of \\"organometallic chemistry\\" were discussion of the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction is enlarged (great!) and the Pauson-Khand reaction deleted (pity).    5) Figures and paper quality are better in the new edition. These reflects in the instructor material  which basically consist of digital figures inserted in ppt for each chapter.    Some not so great comments:    The major flaw of \\"Clayden\\" since its first edition in this reviewer opinion is its lack of sufficient exercises. This was aggravated in the 2ed (the first has around 15 problems per chapter...now only 10!), however, their inclusion as a .pdf downloadable file opens the opportunity for redemption, as itseems there is no reason why this short selection of problems cannot change by 30 or 40 per chapter in the future. Hopefully the excellent solutions guide from the first edition will appear as electronic files that can change with time (yes, it is not yet available).  As a teacher, I usually impart from \\"Clayden\\" and assign the problems from other texts (e.g. Carey adv. org. chem. part A, or Grossman the art of writing reasonable org react mech).  The book is now accompanied by a web site that brings a lot of animations to almost every single reaction that appeared in the text, however, access to this site is not restricted and you don't need to be an owner of the 2ed to enjoy this. (just go to [...] and search)    in conclusion, if you need to buy an organic chemistry textbook, don't hesitate, BUY CLAYDEN 2 ed. However, if you are an owner of the 1st ed, STAY WITH IT as the goodies for updating are not sufficient.
006207394X|5.0|I don't know why this book is as popular as Murder on the Orient and And Then There Were None.Maybe it's because it doesn't really have the fantastic surprises and suspense.It is by no means predictable, but I feel like Agatha really made her characters come to life...I actually started feverishly hoping that certain characters wouldn't turn out to be he murderer/murderess. The only con is that Poirot wasnt as involves as heis usually.<br /><br />This may just be the only Agatha book that left me feeling warm and fuzzy inside with a smile on my face :) One of the best who-dun its I've read.Maybe I'll even buy it!<br /><br />P.s Is British food any better nowadays? I mean really....Fish paste?Ugh!Blegh!

If you have a sight problem, I don't think you will have a problem seeing this calculator.  I love how big the numbers are and all the characters are on the calculator.  I would advise everyone to get this app.
0810988933|5.0|My 7 year old grandson recently has shown a real interest in reading.  He enjoys reading labels on food, street signs, newspaper headline.  He wants to read EVERYTHING!<br /> I decided to order him a chapter book.  Reviews led me to DIARY OF A WIMPY KID.  He loved it.  Has read it multiple times so I guess he's ready for the rest of the series.<br />I love having another reader in the family and this book was a hit.

B0092MKTL2|5.0|Ok, so to start out I should explain why I bought this album, I will do so in dialogue format.<br /><br />Me: Hm, new album from a new band I may like. What are they called?<br />(Searching)<br />Me: Imagine Dragons...<br />Voice inside my head: DRAGONS! GET IT GET IT GET IT!<br />(Buys album)<br /><br />So, considering the ridiculous reason why I bought this album I was very pleased with the music contained within. Radioactive, the first track of the album sticks in my head for hours after listening, but not in a bad way. The two song finale of Nothing Left to Say / Rocks is a really good ending to the album.<br /><br />I will highly recommend this album to my friends.

B0081KTI0E|2.0|Interesting movie not sure it is worth the time.  A bit far fetched even for a ghost scary movie and in some places hard to follow
0316228532|4.0|'The Casual Vacancy' showed me another way in which J.K Rowling is an intelligent, compassionate woman; it's a reflection of societies ugliness that I never would have expected from the author of 'Harry Potter'.<br /><br />In 'Harry...' there was the same depth of description behind the character's thoughts and emotions, but it differs by not interspersing it with the excitement of an epic storyline. The humour I remember fondly from 'Harry...' is also absent; satire reigns in this novel when tragedy doesn't.<br /><br />The story is all about the emotions of the characters and the mistakes they make, and there really isn't anyone you can like 100% because of this; as J.K Rowling said in a recent interview, the hero of the story died in the very first pages.<br /><br />Despite the fact I found 'The Casual Vacancy' a bit slow-paced due to it's focus on emotional and social factors, I barely put it down for the few days it took me to read and it was constantly on my mind when I wasn't reading it. The ending made me cry, which was unexpected due to my disdain for most of the characters. I also loved the way she showed the different perceptions characters had of events; showing everything from the warped/crazy reaction to the level-headed.
B000FGGE68|4.0|May be I am a sucker for beautiful deadly women who can handle a sword (like Milla Jovovich, Resident Evil star and Uma Thurman, Kill Bill 1,2)but I liked this movie so much that I not only saw it on the large screen but also bought the DVD.<br /><br />Those who are looking for some deep philosophical message in this film will be disappointed.  However, if you are seeking a simple story which supports the various action scenes, you may like this film.  There are many mixed reviews of this film but as a fan of the Resident Evil series and Milla Jovovich I wish she had made more of this series (Ultraviolet).  The action scenes are simply fantastic.<br /><br />This film takes place in the future where there is a war between a dictatorial oppressive government (Sounds like some form of collectivist government system) and a group of diseased humans who they are trying to control and dominate.  For me it is refreshing to see a story about government being the enemy rather than some phony and silly large corporation.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like fast action films with great visuals this DVD is worth owning.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|This movie is indicative of the decline of the movie industry.  Apparently all creativity has disappeared.  This is another terrible remake of something that didn't need to be remade or re-imagined.  Don't waste your money.

B005LAIHXQ|3.0|this was an exciting and inventive movie, with stunning viuals and production, some plot twist and a few surprises wherein we look at Scott's allegorical tale of alien adventurers giving rise to a planet of being for some as yet unknown reason...<br />You have a fearless female heroine enduring all thte hardships one can imagine, ego driven men who are willing to stop at nothing to get what they want, hostile alien worlds, futuristic space travel and exploration, alien intelligence that surpasses that of the humans, an android with sinister programing who is still charming and then you come to the end of the movie....and are completely let down by a director's sophmoric turn and plot device that deliberately shys from the obvious implied by the film and throughout to some giddy school boy \\"moral quest\\" and \\"hope\\".<br />Riddley Scott certainly knows how to tell a good tale, to capture the audience however, he does not know how to or when to stop...and so he ruins the whole damn thing.<br />The lesson here is that it is better to quit while you're ahead but he did not do it.<br />I'm not at all certain I will add this to my DVD collection along with the Alien movies, Blade Runner and others.  I was very disappointed.
0439023513|3.0|I had such high hopes for the conclusion, but as I neared the end, it just felt like it was being rushed. Before then, the plotlines had been so intricate and well-laid, but then wrapped up in a tidy, short bow. I still liked th ebook but felt it was of a lower standard than the first two.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|It's been 50 years now since the release of one of the most influential albums in the history of music. In 1962, at the height of the civil rights struggle, a prominent black \\"soul\\" music artist released an album of Country and Western standards, re-imagined with Soul, Gospel, Blues, and Jazz elements. (In hindsight, the strangest part of this story may be that a major record company would be willing to release it.)<br /><br />\\"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\\" went on to spend 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 \\"Pop Albums\\" chart, and four of its singles also charted, including \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" that reached #1 on the Hot 100 \\"Pop Singles\\" chart, as well as peaking at #1 on the Black Singles and Easy Listening charts. (It's worth noting that \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" was the second-to-last track on the B-side, the traditional spot for a throw-away song. There were no throw-aways on this album.)<br /><br />The influence of the album has been both broad and deep. It is widely credited with re-vitalizing the ailing Country Music genre, which had been losing ground to Rock and Roll since the mid '50s. But even more astonishing was the influence it had on the civil rights movement. The album gained widespread sales and airplay throughout the south and had lasting impact on the production and performance of Country music. In 2004 music journalist Robert Christgau wrote, \\"Charles's down-home diction, cotton-field grit, corn-pone humor and overstated shows of emotion [became] standard operating procedure in American music, black and white.\\" After Charles' death in 2004, Rolling Stone wrote, \\"Ray Charles made it acceptable for black people to sing country & western music, in the process doing almost as much to break down racial barriers as did the civil-rights movement.\\"<br /><br />Musically it's almost impossible to overstate the influence this album has had. It was the first album where an artist was given complete creative control, something Ray Charles continued to insist upon for the rest of his career. But most importantly, his complete refusal to adhere to the arbitrary divisions of genre that had dominated the music industry (and in many ways still do), this album opened a door for other crossover artists (Willy Nelson, Dolly Parton, Selena, Ricky Martin, Miles Davis, even The Beatles) to gain the freedom to do something different and still gain an audience.<br /><br />And all that said, the music is wonderful. Opening with a floor-stomping arrangement of \\"Bye Bye Love\\", tender, emotional renditions of \\"I Love You So Much it Hurts\\" and \\"Careless Love,\\" through the brilliant \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" and finishing up with a rockin' big-band arrangement of \\"Hey, Good Lookin'\\" it's virtually non-stop brilliance. It's no coincidence Charles was called \\"The Genius\\" throughout his 50-year career. There's a second volume too, every bit as good as the first, that adds the Raelettes for a lot of the tracks.harles continued to insist upon for the rest of his career.

0439023491|5.0|Although the second book was a repeat of the first, (the Quarter Quell, etc.) I thought this one was better executed since the introductions were already made. Collins delved more into the world at large and we find out more of the history of the districts. Haymitch, Peeta and Katniss' personalities were deeper and more explored, although I felt that Gale was left behind a little.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was told about this book but I haven't read a book in 7 years so I decided to see what the big deal was all about. It's a interesting book, can't wait to get to the 2nd one, I have been told it is better than the first.
0439023521|4.0|I'd had this book recommended to me several times and finally read all three back to back last month. They were easy reads with relatively little sex or language, although the violence made up for it. The movie was a bit more graphic than the book from what I could see. But the future presented is a gritty war story at its heart so violence is to be expected. But it isn't too much to overwhelm anyone older than 13.<br />I've read all about the comparison to some book I'v enever heard of before. And I've heard about theallusions to reality TV and the like. And I can see how that could be interpreted. But what I enjoyed was the portrayal of a strong female protagonist that is more than capable of standing on her own. Even the love story, however muted, is something she isnt quite comfortable with but learns to use it to her advantage. Instead of a man manipulating the circumstances and using a woman, its a total role reversal. I really liked that.
B008NW67E0|3.0|Okay, Babel is good but it's no where near as brilliant as Sigh No More. I suppose if this had been the first album I would have been impressed but it's the weaker sophomore effort I feared it would be. Maybe they're just burned out. I hope something inspires them after the whirlwind world tour they're sure to have following the release of this album. The Boxer is the best moment on the album and it's a cover! Oh well. I still love Mumford & Sons!
0345803485|5.0|I literally giggled like a school girl throughout this book. The author grabs you while taking you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. This book is hot and captivating, a definite page turner. One of the things that I loved the most about this book is that when I read the last page, I had tears on my cheeks. Simply a masterpiece, cant wait to read book two. E.L. James you rock!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Thankfully, this much anticipated book lived up to every expectation I had.  I inhaled all 432 pages within hours, and I find myself bereft, waiting what seems like forever for the third book in this series, even though it is published in December.  Reflected in You is a story about a messy relationship between two people that are obsessed with one another.  We learn more about Gideon's past, and a key player from Eva's past sets into motion a series of events that will have major repercussions in Entwined With You.<br /><br />Gideon is still the obsessive, sexy, demanding control freak we met in Bared to You.  In Reflected, we start to understand how Eva and Gideon's feelings mirror one another's.  Eva is just as obsessed with Gideon as he is with her.  Whether or not these two are good for one another isn't the point.  They have both accepted that they cannot live without each other and remain unbroken.<br /><br />Eva is a jealous girl, and seeing Corinne (Gideon's ex-fiance) in this book just fuels her fire and her own self-doubt.  We did not learn the entire story about Corinne in this book, but I heard just enough to really despise her.  So instead of making a healthy relationship move, Eva makes a poor decision that had me wanting to strangle her!  I was literally yelling at Eva while reading this part of the book.  Of course, Gideon knows just how to punish his Eva.<br /><br />There are some doubts along the way in this book - both Eva and Gideon continually fight the shadows of their pasts.  Somewhere along the way, though, it becomes very clear that these two are committed to one another, for better or worse, and their relationship grows significantly in my opinion.<br /><br />Eva shows some spunk in this book.  She has always been a stronger heroine.  When Gideon tries to placate her, Eva pushes him back.  She won't stand to be pushed around, and she won't allow secrets into her relationship with Gideon.  When Gideon makes an ill-informed decision, Eva isright there to call him on it.  Once Eva figures out what is happening at the end of this book, she takes control of the situation and confronts many characters with a boldness and ferocity that I found myself cheering.<br /><br />One thing I will say, though, is that there were many times during this book where I did not agree with Eva's bi-sexual BFF, Cary.  He made some comments that I wasn't quite thrilled with.  He is trying his best to protect Eva, but I think there are time where he could have gone about it in a better way.  Unfortunately, Cary plays a big role in this book, and not in a good way.<br /><br />With all of this relationship building, Sylvia Day just had to throw a wrench into this story!  Trust becomes a defining issue between Eva and Gideon.  As much as I, as a reader, trust Gideon to make solid relationship decisions and to treat Eva right, I can certainly empathize with Eva's reluctance to give Gideon her blind trust.  There are some serious issues that occur about three-quarters through this book that had me racing through the pages only to find the solution to the problems.  It was difficult reading for me and it had my stomach in knots.<br /><br />This book ends in a strange place for me.  Some of the relationship drama is solved, but there are many nagging questions that remain unanswered.  The ending was a shocker for me, because I was so surprised that Sylvia Day \\"went there.\\"  And even though the ending leaves a lot to think about, I still think that Gideon is my favorite contemporary male character, hands down.  I can only wish that Day will change her mind and expand this trilogy into several more books starring Gideon and the feisty Eva.  If you were a fan of Bared to You, you will eat this book up!  Happy reading!

0345803485|1.0|Unfortunately, this book succeeds only partially as any of these things.  How about formulaic, clumsy and predictable?  There are moments in the story that suggest that in the hands of a decent writer and better editor, this could have been a great book or at least a fun book.  But this is sloppy, juvenile writing that spoils a lot.<br /><br />Passages show the writer's ignorance on many themes. (And am I the only one who winced when I read Ana's decription of Jose's American Hispanic toothy grin? Wow.) This reads like a draft for a filmed mini-series (and then this happened, and then he did this...)This book is only for the curious who want somewhat titillating escapism or for a young audience even though, confusingly, this book cannot possibly be intended for a teenaged audience.<br /><br />First, the odd choice of telling this story in the first person.  This might work if the lead character, Ana, actually took us on her sexual journey with any authenticity. Instead, we are subjected to a \\"cute\\", dim witted and certainly not erotic inner voice of an adolescent who refers to her (cheesy and trite) inner goddess metaphorically dancing, waving pom poms, gesturing disapproval, etc., or to her subconscious.  The writer really needs to look up the word \\"subconscious\\" and its grammatical forms.  If one hears their subconscious on a conscious level, then it isn't their subconscious.<br /><br />Secondly, I know by page 10 how \\"hot\\" and seductive Christian Grey is because Ana says this over and over again with each turn of the page. Though restraint shows up in the story, it desperately needed to show up in the writing.  Ana gapes, blushes, swoons and bites her lip at the beauty of Christian Grey and all of his material possessions. This is recycled through many scenes.  Other than the oft mentioned wealth and beauty of Christian and Ana's bewilderingly immediate physical response, I will have to take Ana's word that Christian is the most amazing man ever.<br /><br />Thereis no build up to anything, no resistance, no intrigue--in fact, it seems that Ana is so immediately smitten that there really is no edge in the story, no conflict.  There are a few obligatory lines of Ana feeling shocked and uncertain about their \\"arrangement\\", but none of the events show any actual resistance to anything.  I'm told she's shocked, but it seems coy and insincere.  The sex comes easily and as often as the smirks and the hitched breathing, without any build up or increasing tension. While BDSM elements enter into the picture, the elements are graphic but not really shocking, if anyone is worried (or hopeful). It all reads like wish-fulfillment. Over and over, I am told that these two characters are helplessly drawn to each other, but the author doesn't draw me to them.  I didn't feel that I was taken through any of the fears or excitement of Ana's sexual introduction, I just had Ana's word for it. I don't need to have it spelled out for me what someone thinks after every email, every glance, every touch.  Christian is the hottest man ever, I get it.<br /><br />Personality-free Ana, who has never had sex, has never masturbated (???), never had too much to drink, has never eaten an oyster for that matter (and she lives in Washington near the coast?) nor noticed any man ever seems a likely foil for a dominating man looking for a blank canvas of a woman to groom--or one as hung up as himself. With the exception of Christian, Ana is oddly dismissive of the other men who pay attention to her in the story, despite the fact that they are also very attractive, moderately successful people. I guess only a billionaire could win the heart of a hardware store clerk.<br /><br />Yet the author brushes for one mere moment against the possibility that Ana may have some of her own quirks which makes her a set up for a man like Christian.  This is totally fumbled and we are expected to buy the implausible notion that ordinary Ana is only going along out of love. Of course, it's probably just a pathetic effort to make Ana seem hesitant and resistant though she never, ever is.<br /><br />It takes some skill for a writer to cross sexually darker lines in a way that is still sexy.  The writer is not up to that, as demonstrated by the bizarre juxtaposition of a damaged, abused character who says he likes to cause pain with a fluffy, female character who, I think, is written to be Bridget Jones-style funny. It is obvious that by the end of the book this story is working toward some revelation about Christian--not Ana. Ana is just a cipher.  I understand that the other books throw in distracting plot diversions and evil characters, but those have to be red-herrings for the real story--will Ana and Christian be able to have a genuine relationship on more conventional terms? In other words, this is a run-of-the mill romance with a little drama, a little humor and some kink thrown into it--a botched mix, to say the least.<br /><br />The dramatic conclusion ends on a rather abrupt, serious note.  Is this because the author has decided to write a more thought provoking story or simply a convenient device to set up a cliff-hanger?  Either way, it's effective and so is the incredibly good marketing of this book.  Incompetent writing looks like high brow erotica and much money is being made off of this--though the ensuing discussions and hype are probably more interesting than the book itself.  And I know that the argument is being made that this started out as fanfiction, but it's being sold as a book. I'm not going to cut it any slack- it needs to be held to the same standards as other printed books. This is not the best book of its type, but it certainly is the best presented to the mainstream consumer.his is not the best book of its type, but it certainly is the best presented to the mainstream consumer.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|It was a humorous movie, suitable for all ages.  I did see some things that may \\"go over the head\\" of some of the younger viewers.  Surprisingly, I knew very little about the original fairy tale, but I enjoyed it and would have no problem with letting my younger grandchildren watch it.
0525953728|4.0|It's been quite a long time that I read a book that I could not put down. The book is more about navy seals, their training and this seals experience - although he was a term leader on the OSB mission. Only a few chapters are dedicated to the mission - but full of non public facts-- It did not go as smooth as the public was told.<br /><br />He does mention other seal missions-- which i found of interest. If you enjoy reading about one of our military elite--this book is for you!

B003N0XDT4|2.0|I really wanted to like the Fiio E7; on paper, it has it all: great specs for audio quality, ability to drive headphones, lots of useful features and beautiful ergonomics. All this, at a great price.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out for my setup; maybe I had a bad unit, maybe this is specific to my system. So, check things out for yourself. That said, I used the E7 as a USB audio DAC plugged into a Win7 PC. There was noticeable 60Hz hum coming out of the headphones. Comparing this to the measured noise floor on my audio recordings, I would estimate the hum to be around a level of minus 60dB (I haven't done any precise measurements; this is an educated guess). This isn't bad at all -- most casual listeners wouldn't notice. But if you listen to classical music (with its huge dynamic range) at ear-splitting volumes, then you will notice. For reference, this is similar to the noise level found on a good quality cassette tape deck from the late 1970s.<br /><br />Thinking it might be a ground loop issue or a noisy USB power supply, I tried plugging the E7 into two difference brands of USB2 hubs with their own power supplies. I then tried a USB2 port directly on the PC's motherboard, and also tried a USB3 port. Nothing helped.<br /><br />This hum likely won't exist when the E7 is unplugged from USB and used as an analog headphone amp. But I bought it specifically for use as a high-quality USB DAC. In this role, it hasn't worked in my setup.  Two stars for the ergonomics, the beautiful display, and for the valiant attempt that Fiio is making to produce quality gear at a reasonable price. I'm hoping that Fiio can fix this hum issue with a small design change; this would turn the E7 into a great device for audiophiles at an unbeatable price.<br /><br />In the meantime, if the hum doesn't occur in your system, or doesn't bother you, I would highly recommend this device -- it is wonderful in every other way!<br /><br />EDIT: Switched to an HRT HeadStreamer, which works great in my setup and provides clear, noise-free sound through USB.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|My husband and I are fans of Sacha Baron Cohen's prior films and were looking forward to some laughs with this movie but we couldn't even finish watching it.  It seemed completely different than his previous work.  It was a huge let down.
B003674Z0U|5.0|An interview with an expert on North Korea that I heard on Minnesota Public Radio in August 2012 referenced Barbara Demick's book, which I had never heard of.  I decided to try to the Audio Book version, checking it out from the library.  Today, a week after starting it, I finished the 10th CD and found the entire experience illuminating.  It was a perfect balance of factual journalism and human interest story development.  Not only did I learn a tremendous amount about the incredible (in the sense of unbelievable) country of North Korea, but I felt for the individuals whose story were told by Ms. Demick.  Nothing to Envy was excellent, and not least because of the fine reading by Karen White.  Her voice and intonations were a pleasure to listen to.  I very much recommend this audio book version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was well written.  I couldn't put it down.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  I will read other books by Suzanne Collins.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The disparity between the highest and lowest ratings has apparently become \\"the story\\" here with actual reviews taking a back seat.  The folks who hammered the book seem to be either SEALs who believe a sacred trust has been broken and Obama supporters who think the author was too critical of the President.  Both sides threw in issues with the editing and writing to support their viewpoints.<br /><br />Insofar as the opinion of the SEALs, I can only say if they're saying it, they truly believe it.  I have the highest respect for them, their devotion to duty and to the traditions of their brotherhood.  However, leaks from the White House and the unscrupulous behavior of reporters who make things up already threatened the anonymity of the Teams.  It's on me that I don't understand their objection to this book, which purports to represent them in a more truthful and favorable light.<br /><br />With regard to the political blowback, there were only a few snarky comments about the President and the White House (similar to those made by sailor and soldier grunts about their leaders since warfare began) and they weren't all that bad.  A few paragraphs in a book this size does not qualify the book as a political rant; far from it.<br /><br />Putting that aside, I found the book interesting.  The writing was adequate to tell the story and many revelations were new to me.  The process of getting from one of the other Seal teams to Seal Team 6 (DEVGRU) was very enlightening.  I was particularly interested in exactly what caused the Black Hawk helicopter to crash in the compound and was hoping to find out, but this was never revealed.  In fact, it seemed to me the author was extremely careful to only reveal information that was already available to the public.  So why is the DOD insisting he broke a confidentially agreement?<br /><br />I bought the Kindle version, which was reasonably priced at $12.99.  Quite frankly, it was hard to put down.  The narrative flowed and the \\"inside baseball\\" of Seal Team training and competition was fascinating.  As the mission on UBL took shape, the story became riveting and compelling.  From that point on, perhaps the last third of the book, it became captivating.<br /><br />Putting all the extraneous objections aside and considering only the content, writing and editing, this is a pretty good book.  If it left any lasting impression, it was that we should be very thankful and respectful to our Special Operations Forces and very fortunate that the SEALS are on our side.<br /><br /> John E.

B008FSCNTK|4.0|I'm not sure about Amazon's policy concerning recommending other sites. Let me just say you can get this in 24-bit flac format. Especially for those who are complaining about the sound quality. Get a DAC, some software like Amarra that works with iTunes, and a really good pair of headphones or audio equipment. It's a HUGE difference in quality.
B008YP272M|5.0|This is a fine chronicle of the demise of master polemicist, written in the period following his diagnosis with terminal throat cancer. It is remarkable for the stoical and unemotional way he progresses towards his own death. As with all Hitchens work it is extroadinarily well written. His use of language never falters. This should be compulsory reading for anybody facing serious surgery or medical adversity - it will give you strength to endure the inevitable discomfort. I am glad I read it whilst awaiting a diagnosis.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I was very pleased with the zip sleeve for my new Kindle Fire.  It fits perfectly and gives my device the protection I need when I'm traveling. It looks nice as well and I'm proud to carry it.
B008G12ERC|4.0|I was instantly relieved that the first track that came out a few months ago, \\"Unsustainable\\", was technically just an intro (or part 1) of the final track. I was afraid we would have a Skrillex-type concept album. They steered mostly clear of their Radiohead-sound, with \\"Supremacy\\" and \\"Explorers\\" sounding the most familiar, but there are too many other influences that are obvious. Panic Station is so '80s Bowie in structure, lyrics, and sound I thought it was a cover at first. There is little that is groundbreaking on this album, but it is enjoyable nonetheless.
B008UTV43K|4.0|I bought the vinyl release of Glad Rag Doll and while the music is very good, the vinyl pressing is so bad that I returned it to the store I purchased it from.<br />This is a very quiet record at times and the vinyl crackled and popped and sounded like an old worn out record rather than a new 180 gram pressing. I would expect all the vinyl issues to be the same so I believe I will go with the CD.  Again, great music.

B008IJHIAA|4.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 REISSUE ***<br /><br />The last of the 5 studio albums R.E.M. recorded for IRS Records finally gets the DELUXE EDITION CD treatment and like the others before it - \\"Reckoning\\" (1983), \\"Murmur\\" (1983), \\"Fables Of The Reconstruction\\" (1985) and \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" (1986) - it's a mixed bag of vastly improved sound quality offset by hollow extras you're never going to play, infuriating packaging and a far-too-steep price tag.<br /><br />Released Monday 24 September 2012 in the UK (25 Sept 2012 in the USA) as a 2CD Mini Box Set on Capitol 509999972000628 - it breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 is the 11-track studio album \\"Document\\" first released on vinyl in early September 1987 on IRS 42059 in the USA and on IRS MIRG 1025 in the UK (39:49 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 2 is a 20-track PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED live set called \\"Live At Muziekcentrum Vredenburg, Utrecht, Holland 14 September 1987\\". It was recorded for Vara Radio and runs to 79:37 minutes.<br /><br />The first thing that hits you is the power of the REMASTERED album which has been done by ROBERT VOSGLEN - never too showy or trebled up - it's impressive to say the least. The drums and bass are so sweet now and the guitars finally heard - making lesser-heard nuggets like \\"Disturbance At The Heron House\\" (lyrics above) and \\"King Of Birds\\" suddenly feel alive. The treated guitar and drum opening of \\"Oddfellows Local 151\\" is HUGE - not overdone - just meaty in all the right ways. \\"Strange\\" is the same - great rocking stuff...<br /><br />The live set with its 20-tracks and near 80 minutes playing time is certainly value for money - but I found after 4 songs its unlistenable - same tune - over and over again. The sound quality is excellent though - great presence.<br /><br />The 10-page booklet has some new liner notes by David Daley describing the US political landscape that so influenced the songs (Reagan, Iran etc) - there's a large black and white fold-out poster and 4 x Lobby Cards of the band. But you can't help but feel that non-album B-sides should be here instead of tedious live stuff - the lyrics aren't reproduced - neither is the inner sleeve to the UK LP - it's the typically oblique artwork that isn't artwork.<br /><br />The overall feel is this - a really great remaster of the album that truly makes you reassess just how good the album was - but the rest is superfluous to requirements - and you're being charged for the privilege.<br /><br />These guys used to be the biggest band in the world - and the excellent remaster of this forgotten album will go some way to explaining why.<br />But I doubt the rest will do anyone any favours...especially long suffering fans...Cards of the band.

Gideon's character is written in such a way that you are rooting for this guy, even when lamenting his high-handed tactics. Loved this book & don't know how in the heck I'm going to wait for the next. The sex is hot, but the story has me hooked.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I should have read more of the reviews of this book before reading it.  The book itself was marginal, nothng exceptional but the ending, the ending was useless.<br />It seemed like the author, got bored with how the book was going, changed things around near the end, and the got bored again and just decided to end the book.<br />I'd expect this from someone who had to write a paper with an expectation of at least xyz amount of words, it seemed that the author realize they had passed the require number of words or pages and decided to just end the book.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|I was really excited to see a zombie series but am a bit disappointed.  Although the show is good for TV, it's not great - certainly not as good as it could be.  I find most of the characters annoying and I don't care when they get killed off (in some cases I was glad to see them go).  Worth watching, but not deserving of the hype.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Yes I read the whole book in less than half a day - I will not give away any secrets of the book in this review.<br />I couldn't put it down.  It was so intense and made you want to turn the page to see what was going to happen to both Gideon and Eva next.  At times my heart ached for both of them.  I love how the author brought everything together in the end.  And yes we get more of a glimpse into Gideon's problems. But more important we get a good feeling of the intensity of their relationship.  I am very happy that the author wasn't replicating anything that resembled Fifty in this book.  This was her own work and was very well written.  Her attention to detail is much better than EL James.  I have to say at the end of this book I think Gideon is hotter than Christian Grey....<br />Now this has me waiting for the third book until December.....

B006VFLIYK|4.0|I always enjoy David Baldacci's work and \\"The Innocent\\" is a fun, comfortable read with a strong story line. It doesn't break any particularly new ground, but it does keep you guessing.<br />It's similar to watching the the umpteenth season of NCIS (Mark Harmon and crew). You kind of know what's coming, but there's enough new challenges to keep it interesting.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|omg!!!!!! I so luv this soooooooo addicting I so reccomend this u can collect prizes and stuff too I LOVE THIS APP YO
B008JAFXOQ|4.0|Tough subject! Outstanding performances all around. Climbing inside the ever-changing mind of a brilliant, hormonal teenager has got to be one hard insight. Hormones running everywhere and no one to notice. I was impressed with how honest the characters seemed. Glad I saw it!

B004DLPXAO|1.0|It absolutely blows my mind that Amazon has completely ignored the number of complaints about the Kindle application becoming unuseable for a huge number of Droid users, months and months ago. The application used to be wonderful, and then came a single huge update that changed the look of the app to the orange/gray logo, and rendered the thing worse than useless. It crashes my droid, locks up my droid, and I totally stopped buying books, and uninstalled it a few times trying to fix it. I read all the troubleshooting and all the forums trying to find a solution. I'm very comfortable with software updates, troubleshooting, patching and rollbacks, but it turns out that the update is simply garbage. It takes too much space, it uses too much memory, and it takes too much power - espeicially when you reinstall the old one, and you see it still works beautifully, other than the fact that now I have to ignore the phone trying to update the app once a day. I figured that the problem would be fixed in a patch very quickly. Boy was I wrong. Apparently Amazon doesn't give a crap about making sure people who would spend money with them are able to easily. The fact that they haven't even added a link to let us download the old working version is also astonishing. Good work Amazon, I always liked you as a company but it appears you have now gone the way of all the bloated greedy monster companies out there, and I waited long enough for a fix. I was looking to upgrade my phone, and was disgusted to learn that now amazon has a partnership with verizon to include non-removeable bloatware on the phone. Like I'm going to just give up and use something I don't want simply because I can't remove what I won't use. So good work - I'm now considering Windows phone and will find a new reading app, and a new e book vendor. Also mad enough to not buy an actual kindle device for my Mom for Christmas as I was planning. Cheers

B0070NSPCU|4.0|An interesting read... the editorial errors that I had read about didn't really bother me.  It was a good value for the price, and I will read the next in the series.
B007THA4FI|1.0|So many great writers out there of adult fiction that can't get into print because they are unknown. But have a name and even a guaranteed sleep inducer gets published. I was told this was a steamy, adult book by the H.Potter author. Steamy? As in 15 year olds getting excited and playing with themselves? Ughhh! I gave this book too many chances to redeem itself, but with so many, many characters of which none are interesting... One reaches a point where one realizes that life is too short to be bored to death. Don't care about the characters, no reason to, since they are as realistic as cardboard cut-outs.
B008HK3QII|4.0|This is a very well-made case. The stitching is very tight, the inner liner is good quality, sort of suede-like (micro fiber) and it has a good tight fit on the Kindle Fire. I like the color combo of black and gray, very sedate and sleek-looking. The only thing that keeps me from giving this product 5 stars is the fact that it would have been really easy to put a pocket on the back of it to hold earbuds, notes, mail, whatever. I know it's not supposed to be a purse or what have you, but that one little extra feature would have pushed this to 5 stars for me. Otherwise, I'd recommend it to all Kindle Fire owners.

B000GCFO08|5.0|I am a massive Silent Hill fan. In the past year, my brother and I have played through all of the games in the series and we love them. We've owned the Silent Hill film adaptation for a long time and I was excited to watch it after having finally immersed myself in the world of Silent Hill.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about the film, and something I think is so important to note, is that they use a LOT of tracks from the games in the soundtrack. You get that intense, paranoid feeling while watching the movie because you had those feelings while playing the games and hearing that heavy, industrial music. Akira is a genius and I'm thrilled that they included his scores in the film.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm surprised that so many people dislike it. The only qualm I have is that the lead character in this is a woman - the girl's mother - while, in the first game, it's a man - the girl's father. But really, the changes are so minor, I don't think it's worth letting it ruin the experience.<br /><br />While watching, we could point out things we remembered from the games, particular scenes that were wonderfully grotesque, just as the games were. I think, as far as video game adaptations go, this is rather stellar. It stays true to the series, includes many of the infamous creatures (The Nurses, Pyramid Head - who's massively overrated and barely even in the games, anyway, but is, for whatever reason, a fan favorite), and the ending is, I think, brilliant.<br /><br />I have my reservations about the sequel, as it deviates a LOT from the third game (which is what it's mostly based on, following the daughter from the first game), but I'm still looking forward to seeing it, especially after enjoying this movie so much. If you're not a fan of the games, you may not like the film, and I think that's understandable. But Silent Hill is an incredible place, and this movie portrays is exquisitely.
0375869026|5.0|I'm reading this book to my fourth graders and the discussions that come out of our reading is amazing.  The themes of disabilities, self-esteem, empathy, shame, friendship, and love are woven throughout the book and allow for deep thinking and thoughtful discussion. Love it!!

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|So not only does Mr. Christopher Breaux's also have a Creole name with family from Louisiana, just like me, he has a strong affection for Stanley Kubrick. And one of Stanley's movies, \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" starring Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, his final movie in fact, plays a central role throughout \\"Channel Orange\\". Like most, I first heard of Frank Ocean, Mr. Breaux's namesake from his buzz worthy Mixtape, \\"Nostalgia Ultra\\". In particular, the track \\"Novacane\\" became addictive and I played it continuously for week's on end.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was a fantastic read. I purchased the book to test out the Kindle app on my Samsung Galaxy.<br />I could not put the book down, I however did end up buying the Paperwhite Kindle.<br />Back to the book, I was very engaged in it from beginning to end.  Much better than the first book.<br />Tattoo took a long time to get going, possibly because of the detailed introduction of the key<br />characters.<br />I highly recommend this book and am looking forward to the arrival of my kindal so that I can<br />read the last in this series.

B003Q6D25K|4.0|A newborn baby has Daniel (Brian Poland) and Kristi (Sprague Grayden) very happy as they bring him home, the teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) is thrilled at having a new addition to the family. Things seem very good though of course there's some \\"thing\\" in the house that destroys some stuff, troubling the family so Daniel gets some cameras installed to make everyone feel safe and to capture anything else that happens. Soon it becomes apparent that this \\"thing\\" is some kind of demon that wants someone in the house and Kristi and the baby Hunter seem to be the targets.<br /><br />What separates this from the original is some more jolts but also shows what happened during the events from the first film, also forgot to mention Kristi is Katie's sister (the girl from the first movie) so it does explain more about the hauntings and why these sisters seem to be the focus. The demon seems far more aggressive in this one and really makes its presence known on more than a few occasions. I did love the kitchen scene where Kristi is sitting in the kitchen and suddenly all the cabinet doors and drawers open at once and the conclusion was truly scary to me.<br /><br />I did like the tie-ins between the first film and this as the events take place around roughly the same time frame. It does allow for some good scares and tension, even if the acting isn't all that great, director Tod Williams does keep the scares coming and keeps the story flowing. Another thing I enjoyed was Ali who really is a pretty girl and did keep me focused on the film. While its of course either loved or loathed I fall into the first category as this chilled me a good amount especially the conclusion. *** out of 4 stars.
B005RUV714|5.0|I am so looking forward to the new season of the Walking Dead. Dish dropped the stations, so I will have to drop dish and find another way to watch. Amazon, you win for now!
B002VKE1K2|4.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />Shortly after moving into a nice house in San Diego, California, two young people are being haunted by an unforeseen force, so the boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) buys a camera to document this and find out whether this force is just a spirit or something far more demonic. His girlfriend Katie (Katie Featherston) seems to be the focus of the demons attacks and she becomes more and more troubled and disturbed as the actions of this demon get more forceful. Given the handheld camera view and the constant night time views of them sleeping in their bedroom it can be seen as boring by some and by no means is the acting that great, the story however is simple and the chills are effective.<br /><br />As Micah and Katie try to figure out what this thing wants, it becomes plenty obvious it wants Katie and will do anything to get her. The closing minutes and the final sequences are quite chilling to me, the conclusion was nice and set up the sequel quite well in my opinion. I do admit to enjoying this movie quite a lot, it at least presents a simple story on the surface that does have some layers to it the more you watch it and the sequel, since they do tie into each other. I have an appreciation for it after watching the sequel and even the third one, so I do credit director Oren Peli for making something that does show how two people just can't do anything to prevent this demon from accomplishing its task.<br /><br />One thing I do want to add is Katie is quite a beautiful woman, definitely kept my attention whenever she was on screen. I do recommend this movie, though I do get why people don't enjoy it, since I found it chilling I added this and the sequels to my DVD library. But its enjoyable to watch, so rent it first to see what you think. **1/2 out of 4 stars.
1401322786|5.0|I was surprised to find some people complained about stereotypical, flat charachters, and while I agree the rich man not wanting to die and a chubby unpopular love delusioned girl are not your John and Jane Smith, they are very well of this world and there is plenty of them around.<br /><br />With that set aside, this book is golden, the author tells a story in a completely fluent and steady way, he knows what to say and how to say it. I like it that the book is short, you never have the feeling it drags and when you're finished, you'd like to read some more. It reminded me of both the Little prince and the Alchemist, but I thought it was a more enjoyable read.<br /><br />What did we learn? You should be aware of the past and future, but think about neither, just live in the present, don't rush too much and share your time with the people around you. Is that not a good enough message?

0030565812|4.0|My brother David went to Robben Island in South Africa and visited Mandela's jail cell.  He brought me back this book on Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom.<br />It is an abridge edition from the original format but you get a good grasp of what makes Nelson Mandela such a remarkable individual.<br />He stood up for the rights of others and the freedom to establish an opposing political party.  He was held in prison for over 30 years and did not get out jaded and bitter, he simply kept on. He won the Presidency and presided over the demise of apartheid.<br />The virtues of his life are continual education, nonviolence, and not being afraid to stand up to injustice.  We can all strive to integrate these values into our lives.

0385344333|2.0|As a long-term Jack Reacher fan, I won't bother to repeat what all the other one- and two-star reviewers have said before me, other than to express my profound disappointment at (apparently) losing a long-time \\"friend\\" in Reacher.<br /><br />The first third of this boring saga was about four people driving across a barren part of the USA in a Chevy Impala.  One of them was a guy impersonating someone called Jack Reacher, apparently a mathematical savant, and also suffering from OCD in that he couldn't look at anyone without recording in minute detail EVERY item of clothing they were wearing.  Unlike the person - Reacher - who he was pretending to be, this guy was afraid of the two alleged criminals, and couldn't even figure out how to take them down, even whilst making several stops along the way and given obvious opportunities to do so.<br /><br />So... the rest of the book was simply an obviously forced, vapid plot structure to enable us to get to page 427 - although it may well, and should  have been, page 327.<br /><br />I'm also guessing Mr Child has utilised a ghost-writer, and one who hasn't done the technical research that he himself has done so meticulously in the past stories.  This ghost-writer (or Child, as editor?) doesn't know for example that no contemporary LEOs would still be using Maglites; they now use long-throw LED flashlights that put the old Maglites to shame.  And no; it simply wouldn't be economically viable for law enforcement agencies to convert their hundreds of existing Maglite bodies to LEDs.  A small technical hiccup maybe, but one that shouldn't have slipped under the radar of a top-selling author.<br /><br />To my mind then, agent Julia Sorenson was, by default, almost the principal protagonist.  Maybe Mr Child could (literally) kill off Reacher, and develop Sorenson's character - maybe as a (former?) FBI agent provocateur? - into the lead rôle in his new stories.<br /><br />The next litmus test of course will be this book's follow-up.  Can Mr Child reinvigorate Reacher's character and invest him with some testicular fortitude?  Or will we discover Reacher drooling over a knee-rug, slumped in a garden seat at some old folks' home, and being tended by a patronising nurse doling out his arthritis medication and changing his Depends?<br /><br />I've given my review one star simply because it's about a Reacher story, plus an additional star because I managed to finish it.up.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|In a country of over 310 million, there are hundreds of people every day who find out that they have cancer or some other terminal condition.  Some face their conditions heroically, and most others manage to at least view their situation with resignation.  Probably very few truly \\"break bad\\" as a means to secure their families' futures after they are gone.<br /><br />This DVD set contains all seven episodes of the first (2008) season of the AMC series \\"Breaking Bad,\\" a drama in which Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling Albuquerque high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, produces methamphetamine with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) as a means of providing financial security for his family before he dies.<br /><br />Cranston and Paul have each won Emmys for their gritty portrayals of two who have gone utterly wrong.  The series shows the unsavory characters Walt is forced to deal with after his descent into crime, the psychological and health morass into which he progressively sinks, his continuing moral struggles after he gets involved, the harrowing effects of meth use on those who take it, and the consequences that crime inflicts on innocent people.  Walter and Jesse end up sinking deeper into crime and lies than they ever thought they'd get.<br /><br />Anna Gunn plays Skyler, Walter's unsuspecting wife.  There are intense scenes showing family decisions about cancer and the choices that many such families are forced to consider in real life, as well as scenes that graphically show cancer's effects.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Bad\\" has been nominated three times for the Outstanding Drama Series Emmy.  The series has great shots of the New Mexico desert, there are even a few funny moments in the series, and this DVD set contains bonus features on how the series was made.  \\"Breaking Bad\\" is definitely not a feel-good series, but its no-holds-barred portrayal of the depths to which flawed humanity is capable of falling has garnered the show many viewers and Emmy nominations.g has garnered the show many viewers and Emmy nominations.

B008H6GH8I|4.0|i really like the realistic approach in this movie. the storyline is deep, the characters all have real pain and emotion. the movie is overall great!

I wasn't really feeling the whole touchy emotional side of it, but whatever. The graphics were insane compared to Degeneration's! This whole movie never had me falling asleep, so that's a good thing.

It's one of those you can't put down as it grabs your attention from the very start and doesn't let it go.<br /><br />A lot of us forget or don't know about the things the Military does for us and our freedom. Special Forces in all of the different service branches go way beyond what is expected of them. I thank God for them and for all the past, present and future military people. Make sure to always thank a Vet with the knowledge that the Vet you're thanking may have been on Special Forces and has repeatedly put their lives on the line for us.<br /><br />This book reminds you of that. Thank you to all people who have served in the military and may God bless you all.

B0092SPYQG|5.0|A perfectly executed rock album, Papa Roach's music and passion in the vocals makes the whole album a treat. Some favorites so far: Give Me Back My Life, Silence is the Enemy
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book!  But I also loved the first and second ones as well!  Not one that you can just put down until its over...and it is a series that is a great re-read!  LOVE THIS TRILOGY!!!!!!!!
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|I did not enjoy this book at all. I was universally bored witless and then guilty because I so love the Jack Reacher novels. This just didnt have any point, the entire premise of it was soft and diluted, Jack Reacher was not the formidable guy I have come to know and love. I struggled to get through this and only bothered to finish the book out of loyalty to the series, certainly not because I couldnt put it down. I would steer clear of this book if you are a fan - you will only feel bad after reading it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is great!  I didn't know if I would like the first book when my husband told me he bought it.  As it was I loved it and stayed up all night just to finish it!  I had to have the second and third books!  I love it!  This one does not disappoint either!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm not much of a reader and I'm loving this book, keeps my attention, and I can't wait to read more - very good story over all must read all the books - I think I will read them agian! highly recommend!
0316228532|2.0|Yes, there's only one reason she wrote this book:  she was highjacked by Muggles, obviously.  I must admit I haven't finished it yet, but my impression is that she was buried somewhere in Muggle-Land when she wrote it.  I hope she has escaped by now.  I hear she is contemplating another Harry Potter novel - GOOD!  Hope she sticks to magic from now on.
0765316994|4.0|The short review: I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />A little explanation:<br /><br />I cut my sci fi teeth on Star Trek re-runs. My entire family watched every Trek series together (original through to the first season of Voyager).  I bought my uncle a red t-shirt that read \\"Expendable\\" for Christmas. I also bought him this book.<br /><br />I have a touch more than an armchair interest in writing as well.<br /><br />I AM the audience for this book. It's meta. It's funny. It made me want to watch old Trek episodes.<br /><br />Ensign Dahl and his friends have just been assigned to the Intrepid - a ship with a horrifically large body count on away missions, and where every now and then the captain and crew get caught up in an overwhelming need to make everything as dramatic as possible. It's like they are living in a sci fi tv show - except it is a horribly written one.<br /><br />I just can't even describe more without spoiling the things that I enjoyed so much.<br /><br />I will say that the story ended before I thought it would, with the remaining pages giving bits about some of the peripheral characters. I don't feel anything missing from the main storyline, though.<br /><br />I'm curious as to how someone who didn't like Trek would approach this book, but then I think they might not at all, so the speculation is a moot point. Yes, sometimes it is a bit \\"on the nose\\" but I felt like I was in on the joke, so it didn't bother me.
B0062P3392|4.0|Assassins. Hired Killers. Some live on the rush. But Danny and Hunter were tired. They saw killing as just a job, not an identity, and they were ready for a career change. Unfortunately the man in charge wasn't accepting their resignation--at least not until they did one more job. What they discovered wasn't one last assignment, but a suicide mission. High-risk, high-profile, low success.<br /><br />There are a lot more people and organizations involved than they originally thought--organizations that aren't supposed to exist.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to others, though some may not care for the romantic subplot. (No, Statham and DeNiro do not get together).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have been waiting for months for this book.  I started this morning and could not put it down.  I am more in love with Eva and Gideon then before.  I love the way that Sylvia paints such a passionate, destructive, emotional, loving relationship.  It truly is a must read.  I am still partial to the first but loved the second.  So worth the wait!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Fairytales are traditional and nobody messes with tradition, right? Price Charming wins the hand of the fair princess and they live happily ever after. But Merida is a tomboy at heart with red unruly hair who loves riding horseback through the woods mastering an archery course. And the princes from the neighboring clans are far from charming. So of course Merida seeks out a spell to change tradition and of course the spell goes all wrong. In the end, the real question isn't will they live happily ever after but who will learn from the experience.<br /><br />I am so glad Disney has created another \\"anti-princess\\" like Mulan. Not all girls have to love pink and fancy dresses. Some can wield swords or bows and fight for what's right.<br /><br />There are a couple intense scenes that some may be sensitive too.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|I ordered the set to keep for those rainy days when all we want to do was stay inside and watch tv.<br /><br />I tried to watch the Deathly Hallows on the 17th of September.  The set was still in the shrink wrap but about half way through the second half of the movie the DVD just went crazy.  No matter what we did, the DVD would not play.<br /><br />I would return it if I could but I no longer have the packaging.<br /><br />Do not purchase DVDs from Amazon.
B008S80P38|5.0|I enjoy mau5music very much and one of the things I like is Joel Zimmerman's sense of humor. Take the whimsical album titles, for example. This time it's \\"> album title goes here &lt;.\\" Amusing. Or, what about the music itself? Try listening carefully to \\"Sometimes Things Get, Whatever\\" on the \\"Random Album Title\\" CD and see if you can avoid breaking into a smile or, perhaps, even an outright laugh. Also, I subscribe to the deadmau5 page on Facebook. It's hard to keep up with the goings on of deadmau5 and Meowingtons. The guy must really be wired to turn out all this stuff and maintain his concert, writing and recording schedule. Really wired! Well, take a look at the song titles on \\"> album title goes here &lt;.\\" How about \\"There might be coffee?\\" Oh yeah, it fits! Lots of coffee. Then, a couple tracks later there's \\"Sleepless.\\" Joel, take care, and my condolences on \\"Take care of the proper paperwork.\\"<br /><br />\\"> album title goes here &lt;\\" starts out with a no-frills primer (\\"Superliminal\\") on deadmau5 music. It's interesting, informative and sets the tone for the 11 tracks that  follow. \\"Channel 42\\" (2nd track) elaborates and is much more interesting and makes for fun listening. Now, in my opinion, \\"Fn Fig\\" (4th track) should have followed as it makes an excellent extension of the previous two (as listed above) and is one of the better  songs on the album.<br /><br />With \\"The Veldt\\" deadmau5 presents the first of four guests. Chris James has a pleasant voice and the track has an excellent background, but it's intrusive and seems out of place. the same could be said for \\"Professional Griefers\\" with Gerard Way and for \\"Telemiscommunications\\" with Imogene Heap. They just don't fit. Then there's \\"Failbait\\" featuring Cypress Hill. This track boldly stands out as not belonging on the album. It's not a bad song and is interesting that deadmau5 can present it, but it ruins the continuity of an otherwise fine album. All in all, I'd say that all of the guest spots detract from the main deadmau5 offerings and the album would be better without them.<br /><br />In general, all the tracks are rather good. I'd say that \\"The Veldt\\" and \\"Take Care of the proper paperwork\\" are the weakest. In my opinion,\\"There Might Be Coffee\\" is the best track by a slight margin. It's elaborate, complex, has  good melody and is almost symphonic. Nice job! The album is quite good  and ranks with \\"Random Album Title\\" and \\"For lack of a Better Name\\" as one of the best deadmau5 albums.<br /><br />Gary Petersonthe main deadmau5 offerings and the album would be better without them.<br /><br />In general, all the tracks are rather good.

B000000OUD|5.0|I am one happy guy.  I have been looking for a used copy of this album, in vinyl, online, which previously was ridiculously expensive; but then it just happened to be reprinted.  I ordered it just in time, my limited edition copy says \\"number 979 out of 1000,\\" so I presume I barely made the cut.<br /><br />The record plays well, the audio quality is excellent, as it should be.  And it reminds me of a better era in music, when my parents hated the s**t I listened to and loved so much.  History repeats itself :D
0307352145|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone interesting in their own introversion or anyone seeking to understand this curious aspect of some people's personalities.  I'm an INTJ myself, and while I've never felt excluded because of my introversion, and have always know there wasn't anything \\"wrong\\" with me, it was very reassuring to be able to understand the nuances therein.  I saw myself in a lot of the stories she related, and a lot of the behaviors displayed.  While my wife (an extrovert) said when I told her about the book \\"You just need to shut up, man up, and be more social,\\" I laughed because, while she was joking, there is a lot of truth in that many extroverts have little understanding of our mindset.  I can think of little worse than having to engage in small talk at a cocktail party, or chat with a mild acquaintance I met on the street.  Equally loathsome are the bubbly extroverts who look at me at a social event and take it upon themselves to \\"draw me out of my shell\\" and force me to engage in the group.  I'll probably end up having some very earnest talks with some people to help them understand me better.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that I felt Susan focused rather myopically on the `sensitive' introvert, which I am not.  While she is, I would like to have had more insight into the more objectively minded introverts who actually have a lot of trouble empathizing with others, and reading social situation correctly.  Otherwise it was an excellent and refreshing read.

I wouldn't call it hard sci-fi, but there is good science and it is presented as feasible and plausible.<br /><br />If you've read any Verner Vinge's \\"Zones of Thought\\" books, I think you'll like this book. At least it's much much shorter :)

B00887490Y|3.0|First you think a boogeyman is terrorizing a small remote town. Then you think the townspeople are turning against a do-gooder. Then you find out she was not so good after all, but you may sympathize with her despair.<br />I will not reveal any more but this is worth checking out for the mystery.  I would not call it horror so much as a tragic thriller/mystery.
B008MBXFEM|5.0|I absolutely loved The Dark Knight Rises.  It is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  With that in mind, I love that listening to this soundtrack lets me relive the whole feel of the movie.  The music just really pulls you in and it's so incredible to listen to.  If you loved the movie, then I highly recommend buying this soundtrack.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|The first two in this triple deal for season two are all right but not as compelling as the ones in season one.  The finale, though, is a real doozy and has a cliffhanger you will not believe!  Moriarty is back and worse than ever too.
0316228532|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  There are too many characters and by the time you get to know who they are, you quickly realize that you don't like or care about ANY of them.  I did read it but could easily have read the first few chapters and then skipped to the predictable end.  I am in disbelief that JKR  put out this pile of rubbish.  I would never recommend this book and even if you can borrow it for free like I did, (thankfully,) it is still not worth your time. Go back to Harry's world, Jo, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is embarrassing no matter how much money you make from it.  Actually, all proceeds should got to charity as you deserve nothing for wasting our time with this claptrap of a novel.

B007FC3AAI|5.0|I was anxiously waiting for this movie to continue the story line with the twilight saga. All the actors did a great job with the exception of the lead actress Kristen Stewart. I would have rated this movie a 10+ if not for her. She came off as very moody and boring for someone who is getting married and experiencing her first sexual intimacy. Still debating if I will buy part 4 the last in the series. The whole storyline is great, just wish they had picked a better actress to play Bella.
0375507256|5.0|I wish I had found this book earlier. Ultimately (as much as I hate to admit it) the news that it was being made into a movie led me to the reviews which led me to buy this book.  It's not the normal type of book I read (either scifi, military or non-fiction historical or how to).<br /><br />I was blown away.  What a great book.  Others have summarized the story so I won't bother doing that.  Rather I'll respond to the criticisms.<br /><br />The knee-jerk reaction is to accuse Mitchell of using contrived trickery to tell six stories.  Sure it would be easy to write six novellas and just cut them in half.  Try writing six (or even five) GOOD novellas then you can cut them in half all you want.  But that's not what Mitchell did.  He takes the things that make us human, that give us humanity, and the characters touch on them only so fleetingly that you miss it until the end.  That's what makes the end so dramatic.<br /><br />In the theme of bondage you realize that the characters are being used or using others in their plots and schemes and in most cases its both.  Sonmi is a slave in the most visceral sense and her story is the most heartbreaking.  Are her actions her own?  Hell we don't even know until right at the end.<br /><br />In the theme of connectedness we watch people try to break the life, bondage, death cycle and struggle at the bit.<br /><br />I think the thing that a lot of the reviewers who left bad reviews can't get over is that at the end we never are sure what is real.  The book is the equivalent of getting punched in the face hard and never seeing your attacker.  Sure it hurts but the pain is what makes us alive.<br /><br />If you are a control freak where every minute of your life has to be planned and orchestrated don't read this book - you won't like it.

B00004STUL|4.0|The chemistry between MARTIN LAWRENCE and WILL SMITH is the strength of this movie. Tea Leoni plays really well (and she looks GOOD) with these guys, too, in this buddy/cop/international drug dealer tale. I thought this was a comedy, but I was wrong. There is humor, yes. BUT, THIS A MAJOR BANG, BANG, SHOOT 'EM UP, BLAST 'EM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH, MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS, CAR CHASE MOVIE. Will Smith exposes his finely toned chest liberally. He looks great.<br />I REALLY ENJOYED the special features commentary by Micheal Bay, the director. It was his first real movie. Bay went on to do the Transformer movies and Armaggedon, so you get the action connection.<br />There's violence and plenty of STRONG LANGUAGE. PROBABLY NOT FOR KIDS. Because BIG ACTION movies are not my favorite genre, I give this movie 3 1/2. But, because I can't give it a 3 1/2, I give it a 4. If you like action movies, you might even give it a 5.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|This film is universally recognized as AMONG THE VERY BEST MOVIES EVER MADE. THAT'S A TALL ORDER. TIM ROBBINS and MORGAN FREEMAN have created characters that will live on in your heart and memory. This story flows from the depths of overwhelming DESPAIR to the heights of GLORY. Reminiscent of Les Miserable, a young man is accused of a crime he did not commit and is incarcerated for decades to endure the worst of what life has to offer. AND IT AIN'T PRETTY!! THE REST OF THE CAST IS STELLAR!! I guess this is the ULTIMATE OF BUDDY MOVIES. The prison friendship that develops and evolves over decades between TIM ROBBINS AND MORGAN FREEMAN is a beautiful thing to see. It's a horror story that's NOT ALL BAD. QUITE THE CONTRARY. How could something so REPUGNANT eventuate into something so JOYOUS?<br />If you have never seen this movie, VIEW IT. (It's about 20 years old) DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Overall, I am pleased with this app. It is generally user friendly, quick and well laid out. However,  it does seem to freeze, requiring a forced close, more often than most of the apps I use on a daily basis. I hope that future versions repair the freezing problem, as I am happy with the app otherwise.
0385344333|5.0|Lee Child has done it again.  In this book, he put together an intricate plot featuring his protaganist with a sense of justice, Jack Reacher.  The reader is taken along on a journey which begins with Jack Reacher hitchhiking at an Interstate highway intersection trying to catch rides to Virginia.<br /><br />A car stops and after what sems to be a debate withing the car, they offer Jack a ride.  As they proceed, otensnibly trying to make Chicago by morning.  Jack's inquisitive mind begins to pick flaws in the story the driver and the other passengers have related.<br /><br />In the meantime, an FBI agent, Julia Sorenson, begins an investigation into a murder and possible abduction near the spot where the car picked Reacher up.<br /><br />Events then unfold in typical Jack Reacher fashion and as usual in one of Lee child books, things are not what they appear.<br /><br />In this book, Lee Child adds a certain nuance to his narrative and his prose is a little darker than most of hid previous works.<br /><br />It is an entertaining read and I highly recommend it.
0525953728|4.0|I felt this was a great glimpse into a little known and talked about realm. Although the author discussed missions we don't publicly know much about, i didn't feel that he gave anything up that would endanger his fellow soldiers. The operational aspects he did discuss aren't anything that isn't already public knowledge. The forward is very thoughtful and says a lot about the author. Also recomended: Lone Survivor.

B005RAO0GS|3.0|The reason I bought Lungs was, well, because of Florence's lungs. I love an amazing voice. Great instrumentals are ok, but for me, it's all about the singer.

B008RC72G8|4.0|I had two big surprises when I started watching Dark Shadows. First: the trailer was very misleading. The trailers made this film look as if it was going to be a complete comedy. Much to my delight, the film was actually a lot darker than I thought it would be. While I have no problem with comedies, I felt that making this a completely comedic film would not do justice to the original Dark Shadows TV show, in which the comedic elements were not its main draw.<br /><br />The second surprise for me was that this felt like an older Tim Burton film. Now when I say that, I mean it feels like a return to his more macabre films than his recent output. Burton has always been at his best in my mind when dealing with horror elements, such as Sleepy Hollow or even Ed Wood. He draws on classic horror films and plays with their tropes. He hasn't been doing this as much recently with the exception of Sweeney Todd. Other than that he's been doing more family friendly films (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland come to mind) which don't capture the feel of his older films. There's nothing wrong with trying something new, but this is a return to classic Burton.<br /><br />The film works fairly well. The funny bits are funny and the scary bits are... well, I guess they could unnerve some people. Burton's usual color scheme is in effect, so expect a lot of dark colors with red highlights. The cinematography was a pleasant surprise, as the shots tend to be very much in the style of old Hammer Horror films (Horror film buffs should keep an eye out for shots that resemble some of your old favorites). The soundtrack is a nice mix of Danny Elfman's score and 70s rock. This is used to great effect throughout the movie (most notably Nights in White Satin).<br /><br />The film is not Burton's best, nor is it Depp's (Both of which would be Ed Wood in my opinion). It is an entertaining film, nothing particularly special... but there's a sense of nostalgia to it... Both forfans of the show and old Burton fans.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Burton/Depp or those who liked old Hammer Horror films.
0553582445|5.0|Forewarning: I'm a spoiler purist, and so try to avoid spoilers as much as possible in my reviews, including basic information about both plot and characters. As a result, my reviews are somewhat vague, but I try my best to keep things spoiler-free.<br /><br />There are few joys like immersing yourself again into the life of a character you already loved. Despite the time it's taken me to get around to these books after the Farseer trilogy, I still fell right back into the world, like easing into a warm bath. Fitz is the driving force behind what makes these books work; whether you like or dislike these stories will probably hinge on whether you like or dislike who the central character is.<br /><br />From the first pages of 'Fool's Errand', it's obvious that Hobb is telling a much more character-focused story than she has before. The first two hundred or so pages are about Fitz's life, fifteen years after the events of the Farseer trilogy. In all honesty, I think a great deal of this should have been at the end of 'Assassin's Quest'; if it didn't make for such a great opening here, I'd still wish that were the case.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewers who say this is all very boring. Whether you find this opening section - and by extension, the rest of Fitz's life - interesting or not will depend on what makes characters interesting to you. More directly, this is a question of what you consider \\"something happening\\" to mean. In this opening section, there are lots of things happening, almost all of which are about the difference between Fitz's old life and his new one, and how these two opposing forces pull Fitz in opposite directions. It also consists of the things in Fitz's new life that pull at his present state of mind, and of the common threads in Fitz's life which will always pull him with them.<br /><br />To be blunt, this returns again to whether you like or dislike character-driven stories, and why you're interested in Fitz in the first place.<br /><br />Characterisation and character development scarcely needs to be complimented anymore. Hobb has well established herself as a master at this. Still, I think she's improved on her craft here. Fitz's character is superbly done. There's psychological progress with him, on such a deep level, and that's just the starting point for these books. The fifteen year time gap is accounted for perfectly, and with some to spare. The other characters, too, have a great deal of depth to them, and those recurring from the previous books have their own additional development. It's one of Hobb's talents, to create such vivid characters that it almost always feels there's a greater depth to their relationships than is ever shown. I'm going to have to reread these books again more carefully to figure out how she does it.<br /><br />The plot is introduced very smoothly, and follows a very well thought out path. As is Hobb's style, much of the plot action and the twists and turns are character-driven, drawn forward by the tension and actions between characters. It rambles a bit. This is the worst criticism I can level against the book; that I felt the plot dragged on for a bit in the middle. It scarcely merits mention, but that's the only thing I disliked about this book.<br /><br />And don't think you'll be getting away lightly because this is the first book in a trilogy. There are some Significant Things that happen here. They hurt. I didn't think I'd cry this early in the series, but I bawled over one event in particular. I'd intuited that this was going to happen sometime in the series, but thinking, or even knowing, something is going to happen doesn't prepare you for when it actually happens. This scene is so beautifully written and so skilfully delivered, the imagery so powerful, the character relationship captured so clearly and tenderly, that I still can't read it without crying.<br /><br />This is one of the main strengths I've found in Hobb's FitzChivalry stories; that eventhough I predict alot of what's going to happen, it hits me hard. Hobb aims up for these occasions and knows how to write the scene as near perfect as is possible. This book is worth reading for that scene alone.<br /><br />The last brilliant thing Hobb does is write a proper ending. It draws the story of `Fool's Errand' to a close, making it as close to a stand-alone book as you can get in a trilogy of this type. And she's written it as competently as the rest of the book. I'm hoping she'll continue this sort of thing with all her future books, rather than just ending this book here at a natural break point.<br /><br />4.5/5

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great read. Keeps you interested until the end. Also, gives you great respect for what SEAL Team Six members do to prepare themselves to be ready for impossible missions.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game so much I have it on my kindle and my phone! Thank you for creating this game...I'm addicted!
0671449028|3.0|Not a favorite board book in my house. Nor is it a favorite bedtime book. It has some great lines<br />but the pages don't really jibe together for us. It's just kinda a \\"meh\\" book in our collection.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|All 3 books were a good read. I do understand what the hoopla is about and I dont think it pertains to the BDSM lifestyle rather than more of their love story. I couldnt help but notice she flushes a lot and he runs his fingers through his hair constantly. The inner goddess references were redundant and I felt that the female's character was down graded by apologizing all the time. All in all they were a decent read. It actually encouraged me to read \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\" which was fantastic.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I don't understand why coin dozers are so addicting but they are.  I found this one just as much fun as the real thing.  Perfect when to need to take your mind off strenuous things and just take 5 with a no brainer.
B0092QITO2|3.0|Title says it all, the choreographed fight scenes between Beckinsale and Farrel were delicious. I always wanted to see more of Sharon Stone in the original, and hello 21st century, a villainous girl can beat the hero's butt in these movies now. Having said that, It was just unbelievable that Farrel could kill a room full of guards but couldn't even bruise his wife. I will be buying this on dvd (huge Beckinsale fan here) but I honestly prefer the original with Arnold.Time may have produced a sleeker remake, but the plot of the original was simply better. It made more sense.  I loved the Mars angle of the original, it gave purpose to the elaborate deception of erasing Quaid's memory. I could see the value of introducing oxygen to Mars and why people would risk their lives for it. In this remake, I just do not understand anyone's motivation. What did the villain want? just to install an army of robots? Why erase Quaid's memory? They should have guessed where the resistance leader would be hiding, I did. It proved completely anti-climactic unlike the excellent special effects used to explain why the original resistance leader was so hard to find. I missed the elaborate makeup of the original mutants, even the effort to fool quaid into thinking he was still at recall was more believable in the original movie. As for special effects, Arnold and the gang didn't do such a bad job back in the day. Yes I know this is a retelling, not an exact replica, But aside from the sleek effects the original is just better as far as I am concerned. Good try though!
1469984202|5.0|This book is a microcosm of what I like in a great fictional read.<br /><br />1. Fully fleshed characters that I have a vested interest in.<br />2. A world I can instantly visualize vividly described.<br />3. A story line that is interesting and full of well thought out and believable turns.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read more of Hugh Howey's works.
0307346617|5.0|I liked this book a lot.<br />Every chapter surprised me with a new take on the Zombie theme.<br />One of the best Zombie books ever.
B005LLX582|3.0|The movie arrived on time and in good condition.  However, the quality of the movie was poor.  Disappointed in the quality and the content of the movie.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|This band is incapable of making a bad song the only problem is I can't help but listen to way to much 3DG. This album is amazing everything about it is fantastic. It will be on repeat for the next few weeks. Not only are they able to produce incredible music but live they are just as good and full of energy. Please check this album out if you like these guys, you will like this album. They change their sound enough to keep you interested, but stay original enough to remain the same band we have grown to love.
0007466064|5.0|I love this series and was absolutely delighted when I saw the last 2 installments. I've just finished Dreams and Dust and was very satisfied with the storyline. These books are such fast and good reads I can't put them down. Definitely up in my top 5 fantasy fiction list. And I'm hard to please when it comes to that genre lol!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The book started off really well and fast paced but halfway through I was losing interest. The characters all seemed really flat and uninteresting. It seemed like lee child was hurrying through writing this one. Maybe he's running out of ideas?
B001KZI2WW|5.0|Can't say enough about the comfort of these shoes. I love the style and look of them and they just feel wonderful on my feet. Highly recommend!!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I do not understand why so much of hype around this title.  Nothing more than Glorified porno literature.  a total disappointment
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Had a different alarm clock app which had far too many additional programs with it.  I liked it but didn't need the additional stuff.  So I downloaded this app which meets my needs.  It works well and is just what I need. Recommend if you only want an alarm clock!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow. It is difficult to know where to start with this review. When Bared to You released, I loved the book, but I had questions as to whether Eva and Gideon would be able to turn their attraction into a lasting relationship. One thing was made clear, whatever would come for Gideon and Eva, it wouldn't come easy.<br /><br />With eager anticipation and a healthy dose of curiosity I began Reflected in You. I read the whole book in one sitting. Reflected In You grabbed me, sucked me in, pulled me along an emotional roller-coaster, and left me in awe. Readers, if you sit down with this book hoping to walk away with that blissful, romantic feeling then this series may not be for you. Gideon and Eva struggle. Their relationship is plagued by their individual insecurities, communication breakdowns, and the demons of their pasts. However, the rawness of the emotions between Eva and Gideon is striking. One minute I was convinced that they would never be able to make it work. A few minutes later, I was crying and hoping that they could just keep it together.<br /><br />Reflected to You is a book that stands out in it's genre. I am convinced that part of the reason this book is notable is because of the realism of the story. This book, this series, does not read like a fantasy romance. The issues the characters face feel real, the emotions they deal with and turn to feel real. The characters actions are understandable, in their own way. The attraction and chemistry between Gideon and Eva heats the pages. There is no question that this book is a smoking hot read with powerful, emotional, dominating sex. However, Sylvia Day makes it clear, there is much more to this mesmerizing story than sex. Gideon and Eva both have to deal with the ugliness that has plagued both of their lives and deal with harsh realities and nasty truths that they would rather stay hidden. The powerful, emotionally-charged sex between them can bring them together, but it could also push them apart.<br /><br />Eva is very definitely high-maintenance. She needs security and independence and her trust is not easily gained. A stunning realization (for me) in this book was the realization that Gideon is so much like Eva. They both need something from the other person that is the hardest to give, trust and truth. There were places in the book where I could guess what was to come. Nevertheless, I was still floored when these things actually happened. There were places in this book where my own heart was breaking for the characters. Even with the gut-wrenching emotions, I was very pleased with how the characters began learn and grow. They both make plenty of mistakes, especially Gideon with his refusal to openly communicate. However, they do begin to learn to make concessions for each other and learn more about each other throughout Reflected in You. As I have said, nothing comes easily and there are always consequences.<br /><br />Reflected in You got to me. I felt like I was on this journey with Gideon and Eva, my heart breaking when they were sad, rejoicing when they were happy, feeling frustration at the difficulties. It was not an easy book to read, but I loved every minute of it. Reflected is a book that will stick in my mind for a long time; I am sure to read it over and over in the future. The story is far from over though, they have much to work through and even more issues to uncover.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva have an addictive relationship, they are addicted to each other, for better or for worse. As for me, I am addicted to their story, their journey through dramatic highs and lows. I am once again eagerly anticipating the next installment in the series. Keep it coming Sylvia Day, I can't seem to get enough.<br /><br />*I received this book for an honest review*/>Eva is very definitely high-maintenance.

B001BNFR6W|1.0|I have loved owning Will & Grace from the standpoint of how amazing of a show it is.  But, unfortunately, I ordered this item and nearly every disc skipped.  Amazon very graciously sent a new box out for free but the second box set ALSO skips.  I am very upset with the manufacturer of this product because they seem to be the cause of the problems (again, Amazon has been amazing).  Additionally, I have seen on other sites that the discs of the box set also skip.  Do I recommend Will & Grace as a show to watch? DEFINITELY!  Do I recommend buying the box set?  Unfortunately no due to the damage on these discs.
0061906220|5.0|This book not only teaches colors, it's also fun to read.  It captivates my 21 month old from start to finish every time.  Great book!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|what more can I say. I love it!!!! its fun easy to use and enjoyable. I recommend this to everyone who wants to organize and manage their notes.(:
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|brings back memories.<br />prob is the sound in middle command cracked. popped and clicked all the time. this made playing the game with sound very unpleasent.<br />decided not to invest money. because I want my sound!!!!  was afraid the rest of the games sound would sick also.<br />I have a kindle fire. so if u want to play middle command with sound be upset when the sounds suck!!!!!<br />uninstalled. I want good sound!!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|its really fun but nothing will save! I was just playing and then my kindle died and now my world did not save ANYTHING I have did!!!! Some one HELP ME!!!!!
B0098XY5VK|3.0|great game but it wont let me purchase full version. i cant even find the full version within the app store. would like to play the whole game. is there a full version available?
0525953728|5.0|Very informative information into what goes on in a very tense situation. We owe alot to these men who risk everything for our mundane daily lifes that most Americans live. Most people have no idea what is going on. And what these men are about and what is expected of them. We need to thank them for what they do.
B006YB9VJU|1.0|I didn't buy it because i already knew it wasn't compatible, but i think you guys need to know this.<br /><br />This is a great product and work with the Xperia S and Xperia Sola, but it doesn't work with the Xperia U because it needs NFC wich it doesn't have it.<br /><br />When i read that it was compatible with Xperia U, i surf the sonymobile web page and didn't find the compatibility so i start a chat with a sony agent and i was right, it is not compatible. So if you own a Xperia U<br /><br />It's a bad item description from the seller.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked this book best of the three in the series. There was more to the story and we learned so much more about Christian and why he had \\"fifty shades\\". If you are looking for something deep this series is not it but it was still a good read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A game that everyone will enjoy. The game is very well paced and will take people back to the days when they went to the fair.
B008XG1X18|2.0|this app freezes and force closes WAY too often. very glitchy app. disappointing!! please fix this app Bc I love pinterest.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I won't go into detail about each episode with this series, because others have done a great job doing that.  I just want to give my general thoughts on this series.  My feelings about this show can be summed up in two words......Jessica Lange!!!  She portrays a southern matriarch with a dark twist.  Her ability to switch from sugar-sweet to a blood letting B*%#H is worth the purchase of this alone.  I would liken her performance in this series to that of Elizabeth Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.  In both of these you have a very strong southern woman who is not afraid to take charge of the situation.  The writers of this series should also be praised for constructing a story that hooks the viewer from the beginning, and then leads us down many dark hallways to understand just how haunted this house truly is.  The thing I really liked about the Horror Story is that it is self-contained.  I don't want to give anything away, but I was quite surprised at the ending.  I am on the edge of my seat as I wait for the beginning of Season Two of this fantastic series.  In the meantime, I will enjoy going back and watching Jessica deliver lines that make me want to whip up a Mint Julep and enjoy it in my swing on the verandah, while perhaps taking a crack shot at the neighbor's annoying dog (insert dark laughter here).  If you're looking for a show that has a great storyline, fantastic acting, and darkly twisted, The American Horror Story is the show for you!!
B008JAFXOQ|3.0|VERY GOOD CONCEPT BUT IT RUNS A LITTLE TOO LONG. A GOOD WATCH IF YOU HAVE THE TIME. THE ACTING IS VERY GOOD AND THE STORY IS VERY INTERESTING.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Interesting treatment of the fragile nature of family and what passes as rational response to the unexpected slings of life.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|I bought this as a present for my daughter and she really likes it. I watched part of the DVD and it seemed like it was just a live concert filmed somewhere...<br />I'd say that it met the needs and expectations of my 9 year old daughter! ;)
B004FPZ2LI|2.0|I read this book years ago and forgot that I had read it.  It was not enjoyable then and certainly not a enjoyable read the second time.  I regret the purchase.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It seems like I've been waiting forever for this book to come out! What an amazing and gut wrenching love story! It was such an emotional roller coaster ride that I felt for all of the characters as if I had known them. I love Ava and Gideon they are soul mates helping each other get through there horrible pasts. I can't wait for the third book I just hope it's a happy ending they totally deserve it!!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game is fun! The game looks like Rayman orgins. You run and have a ton of fun! yay yay yay!
B00846REIS|4.0|I like the fact that this time, both main characters come from similar economic background, none is saving the other and both are quite damaged. I downloaded it since it was recommended to whoever liked 50 shades of gray. It is not so good, but I liked it anyway
B004UQPM4E|4.0|Let me clear this up. I rarely write reviews for Amazon. In fact, check my stats, I only have a few. Only when I feel strongly enough about something. However, I always 100% of the time, read reviews before I purchase a product. The other reviewers are absolutely correct. This is not the original US released Blu Ray set. This in fact on the outside of the box when you receive it has UK ratings all over the cover and back. The discs are labeled with just pictures of Superman and you would have no idea which is which unless you read a tiny writing print on the edge. The rest is in Spanish all over the rest of the disc. However, this all being said, this plays perfectly, and is 100% the Blu Ray Warner Brothers releases and extended releases of each movie and the quality is exceptional. I see no difference in quality and in fact the Blu Ray is great. The title menus are not glamorous and I would be curious to see if the US version has the boring menus this version has. I played each movie quickly from start to finish and they play perfectly and are not in Spanish. Not sure if anyone cares if the disc labels are not titled, but I don't care and I have decided rather than return this, I am keeping it. Who cares if the box is in a UK rating and the labels are in Spanish?<br /><br />The only thing I have to say is shame on Amazon for not noticing this and shipping a faulty product like this and listing this as US. Get the description straight and stop being deceitful about the content of your products.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book tells more about how hard this work is, in every way.  The physical training which continues forever it seems. Waiting for a mission's deployment while staying hyper-excited about it. The story needed to be told. I admire the writer immensely and hope the \\"powers\\" don't prosecute him. He's a hero.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Fast reading and just O.K. Like reading the same  book over and over...at some time you want something new. The same book in the future and the casting of Tom Cruise for the movie version of Reacher is pointing toward this character jumping the shark.
B000062V9C|1.0|I wanted to see in LARGE PRINT that is came from Australia and will not not work in a US DVD player, total waste of $$$. So looking and found another source for electronics, games, movies. Bad form guys!! lynn Bordelon
B0002TJGQS|5.0|The batteries have worked fine for every product I have needed them for thus far.  I have paid more for ONE battery of this type than I paid for TEN (10) going this route.  For that reason, this will be my first choice for future replacement batteries of this type...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's a nice game for my little sister. she enjoys it a lot and it keeps her very much entertained.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|If the rules didn't say \\"Reviews must contain at least 20 words about the product\\" - I could have summed up my review in this way:<br /><br />Not good.<br /><br />I have all her CD's and, in truth, she is one of my all-time favorite female singers.<br /><br />Not this time around.<br /><br />If you're a real fan of Diana, I can't imagine you'll like this effort.<br /><br />Sorry. JMO
B0030A0ZD4|1.0|The video was poor quality. My daughter was really disappointed!!! The color is off. Definitely not BlueRay quality!! This will result in me having to purchase another DVD for her!!!
B000026C3T|5.0|Excellent quality, very speedy mailing.. Packaging? Perfect! Well done AND recommended!!!!<br />Both discs played perfectly! The remastered sound enhances Led Zep just the right amount.. Perfect!
0525953728|5.0|Well written with comedy and action packed real life adventure.  Met my expectations and some. I Recommend that you read this book.
0735204551|5.0|The  books covers  how your subconscious mind controls your thoughts.  One can manifest wealth, good health, etc., by the data it unconsciously feeds its brain.  There is power in the thoughts we feed ourselves. Its great to go beyond the mind to your subconscious mind and finally realize that  you are not your mind. You can be the master of our mind or the slave. Mentally step back and  observe your thoughts as an outsider, this will calm your mind.  The mine cannot observe its self and have thoughts, it will become quite.  I have read Bhagwan Rajneesh, Ohso, Echkart Tolle, & other books  that focused on the mind and its powers this(Power of the Subconscious Mind) is a easy read compared to the other writers.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is an excellent book and while the author doesn't hide his own political sentiments, the book does not reflect any bias.  It is a calculated and precise account of what went on in the Bin Laden compound and the effort it took to track down and terminate the disciple of primitivism.  I couldn't stop reading it.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|It was pure joy listening to this CD. Being a lover of classical music it met all my expectations and more. As the book was marvelous so is the CD. I can't say enough about it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest so this app is great. There are some issues with the app itself...like sometimes when I open it it does not load and must be forced close but then if I wait a few seconds and reopen it it is good go. Issues are minor and this app is totally worth using. I LOVE that I can use pinterest on my Fire!!! :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were so good I stayed up all night to finish reading them. The descriptive text made it so very easy to put myself right there in that time and place with Katniss.
0061452068|4.0|I don't like this book. I don't like it at all.<br /><br />So why did I give it four stars? It's because the book starts out well, and is useful but eventually it declines into a polemic for creative, compassionate, conservatism. I like the idea of books that tell you the world is not coming to an end, and there are many reasons which are raised here that support that point of view. All good stuff, and things that I believe in.<br /><br />But where the book goes wrong is past the half way mark. I can accept Matt Ridley's points that civilization was helped by the notion of barter. I think there are other points of view about barter but it is a reasonable attitude. Where Ridley comes unstuck is when he moves to present-day concerns about the planet.<br /><br />It seems to him that the current set up of states is sufficient to keep the world going. I think that Matt has a more open point of view than some people on the right about climate change. However the intimation is that all will be well if we let the same people run the world in the same way. I don't believe that forthcoming climate change will be fatal, but I do believe it needs attention.<br /><br />It's very easy to rebut the arguments on climate change by pointing out some of the outlandish claims from the 1960s and 70s. It's rather like the man in the 1880s who believed that by 1920 main streets in cities would be impossible because of the huge amounts of horse poop. Things change. They get better for a number of reasons and the workings of the market are only a small part of the changes.<br /><br />Ridley does not take into account the skeptical nature of people. What we heard was that things like overpopulation and global warming would bring about major changes. What we thought was that something ought to be done, but it probably wasn't as bad as some were making out. And each warning was based on scientific research that showed that there was some problem and that we needed to watch it carefully.<br /><br />These ideas have entered most people's thinking. Maybe some things about Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" were overstated, but we've taken steps to make sure that we haven't carried on with the bad practices which she drew our attention to. And many of the new rules are ones that impact a vast majority. You can't take your groceries home in a plastic bag anymore. You're encouraged to use recycling schemes set up by local authorities everywhere.<br /><br />Most people are aware that there are environmental processes that need to be carried out. That applies just as much to people who want to have coffee in non-biodegradable cups and also businesses who want to discharge waste into the water supply. That means the cost of doing business goes up but so does the cost of living. The environment affects us all.<br /><br />There is probably a point somewhere in this book where Ridley could have finished and given us a book well worth reading. Maybe you'll notice it, maybe you won't. So I advise you to read it with a critical eye. For lots of the pages, you won't need to bother too much. It's worth the read, but if you want a better introduction to the same subject, try the book \\"Abundance.\\" It doesn't come with the same historical perspective that Ridley's book does, but it will reassure you that the world is not going to hell in a hand basket.br />These ideas have entered most people's thinking.

1439190275|5.0|Great book but same as old one I thought it would have more recepies. I was also under the impression it would have better recipes for shedding weight as it stats shedding weight
B009G8GRX6|1.0|I really like much of Muse's music including The Resistance but this is really an awful album. Maybe 2 or 3 listenable tracks total. Avoid.
0439023513|5.0|This book/series of books keeps all ages intrigued! I have read all of them and I have passed them around to my coworkers! We love to talk about what happened in the book and what we thought about situations! It's a fun read! You cannot put the book down! Suzanne Collins is brilliant!
B004XISI4A|4.0|Nice continuation of the story. Glad that not all characters I like were killed. Enjoyed this more than the book number 4. Less confusing.
B008J34466|5.0|For anyone who is unsure - PINK has a zillion tatts and cusses!!  BFD - it shouldn't be a shock to anyone.<br /><br />This CD is very good.  To me it's better than Funhouse - which I thought was amazing.  I've been a long-time fan, but I fell off for most of her middle years.  Funhouse brought me back and this will keep me buying probably forever.  The mixes with other artists on here are really good also.<br /><br />Anyone who is wondering if they should buy it should consider this - you could waste $10 for lunch or get this CD that will provide you with some serious entertainment.  I mean come on - Emenim is on the album.<br /><br />Pink is getting to be huge, and I'm glad for her.  She is a powerhouse in every way.  Serious vocal talent and no lip-syncing BS like most everyone now, good variety of slow and fast songs, just an all around fun album.  And Slut Like You is hilarious!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest!!! If I need some ideas about anything I can find them here! From parties to craft projects this is the resource I check first!!!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|spent time just passing it with this game<br />it was fun and kept me busy enough that I had to make myself put it down
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If I could assign a book to teachers and parents at the opening of the school year, this would  be a strong candidate. Like the introvert she is, the author explores her subject with care and subtlety, sharing insights about the quiet ones among us and suggesting ways in which they make life richer. We see how introverts often suffer in our rah-rah, extroverted culture and how we might nurture them especially when they're young. I liked the combination of research and personal anecdotes that made the findings come alive.This is accessible psychology without  too much pop.
0345803485|2.0|I just started reading this book, with some hesitancy, at the recommendation of a few friends. I'm not a super high-brow reader, but still, the level of writing is fairly low here...and the more I read, the more I was annoyed. It reminds me SO MUCH of something I read in my mid-20s or worse - when I read Danielle Steele's schlock as a teen. \\"Christian Grey\\" and \\"Anastasia Steele\\"? Really? Hell even reading the tidbit on the Amazon page gives you the perfect impression of this book...it does feel like it was written by a teenager. The more I read, the more irritated I became. Our main character is 21: hasn't been kissed, hasn't had a boyfriend and has never drank or been drunk. Good lord - c'mon! We really have to start at square one with a complete novice? Add in she's a bookworm infatuated with British lit and it's a major eyeroll. I'm sure the author thought this was the best pretext for the sex to come, but man is it sooo annoying. I'm not sure I can even keep reading to get to the sexy bits. I kind of hate it.
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|A spectacular album. Haunting, ethereal, and at times quite bouncy! If you're looking for one of Loreena's more traditional Celtic albums, this isn't it. Like Mask and Mirror it's got a few with a more global aspect.<br /><br />Positively delicious. I love listening to this with the acoustics of my vaulted ceilings. Light a candle, pour some wine and just listen.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|There is a first time for everything, and this is the first Reacher book I really did not enjoy. About one third of it consists of narrative about Reacher riding in a car as a hitchhiker.Boooring. He never really did beat anybody's butt. He just thought about it a couple times. The only action was at the end where he shot a few badguys.Anybody can do that.<br />If Lee Child actually did write this one, which I doubt, then he must have done it under a publisher's deadline. Just fill 300 pages before a deadline. Or maybe Reacher is getting old.....<br />Save your money. Go check out Mitch Rapp, Tommy Carmellini or Juan Cabrillo. Reacher is done.
B000006NPY|5.0|Are you ready to go on a heartbreaking journey of love, betrayal, love lost, and utter loneliness? Such is the content of The Smashing Pumpkins' lesser known 1998 album \\"Adore.\\" Although disregarded by most for its lack of a radio friendly, feel-good single, it is the favorite of Pumpkins fans of a dark persuasion like myself. \\"Ava Adore\\" opens the album, setting the tone of complete, dangerous commitment- \\"In you I feel so hungry, in you I crash cars. We must never be apart.\\" \\"Perfect\\" goes on to revel in love, and the album continues to vacillate between romantic ecstasy and ominous thunderclouds. Minor chords are found in nearly every song, however, giving a dark background to a doomed relationship. By \\"Tear\\" Billy- it's hard not to imagine the musical genius composer and lead singer as the protagonist- sings of the break-up, seemingly from the depths of a dark pit. He rises out of it slowly in \\"Crestfallen\\" reasoning that they were never meant to be and continues on with his daily life in the pedestrian worded middle album songs. In \\"Shame\\" Billy appears to release his vaunted vision of what love can be, and leads into the three song finale of \\"Behold! The Night Mare\\", \\"For Martha\\", and \\"Blank Page,\\" together the loneliest music I have ever heard. By \\"Blank Page\\" Billy is wandering the cornfields, wondering in what shotty motel room his former lover is holed up in.<br /><br />If you are suffering from a break-up or just feeling down on a rainy day I would highly suggest putting on \\"Adore\\" and crying away your pain, identifying with Corgan's story as one would with a blues album. I venture to say it is among the best Rock Blues albums out there along with Elliott Smith, Tom Waits, and Marilyn Manson.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Legendary Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison has released his 35th album (10 tracks) titled 'Born To Sing : No Plan B'. It was recorded 'live' in studio & it's his first release in 4 years : Van Morrison shows his great experience & talent as he has been in the music industry for 50 years. The overall feel of the album is great and you can't miss his recognizable/unmistakenable songwriting style, voice & horns sound that have made him famous. Van Morrison is jazzy in this CD release as in the tracks \\"Born To Sing\\", \\"End Of The Rainbow\\", \\"Close Enough To Jazz\\", \\"Mystic Of The East\\", \\"Retreat And View\\" & \\"Educating Archie\\" and bluesy in the track \\"Pagan Heart\\".<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Open The Door (To Your Heart)\\" (opening track, great guitar/horns sound, vocals & melody), \\"Retreat And View\\" & \\"Pagan Heart\\". Great tracks include \\"Goin' Down To Monte Carlo\\", \\"Born To Sing\\" (title track), \\"End Of The Rainbow\\", \\"Close Enough For Jazz\\", \\"Mystic Of The East\\" & the closing track \\"Educating Archie\\".

B008MG1E4A|4.0|GOOD - NOT GREAT .... MAYBE A FEW MORE DETAILS THAN EXPECTED BUT UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS THAT WOULD BE IMPOSED ON THE AUTHOR.
B008220DIC|3.0|Philip Hoffman (L.Ron Hubbard/Lancaster Dodd) is a religious predator, and Joaquin Phoenix (Freddie) is his intended victim.  It's hard to miss the homoerotic overtones between the two men.  Dodd would do anything, push any button (including \\"manliness\\"), to get his recruit.  Mainly he uses a kind of recorded questioning technique that garners all the important details about his target's life, which he can later use to manipulate him.  Freddie is crazy (one reason why he looked like prey to Dodd, not to mention his potential role as \\"the enforcer\\"), but not crazy enough to fall for it all. At the end, after his most important relationship has been ruined, Freddie is able to remain true to himself and his own goals (but still crazy, possibly even crazier because of the cult).<br /><br />The acting was great--- religious predator, his techniques, his narcissism, his control/manipulation, and all of his victims.  And it showed that a targeted victim can eventually resist the undue influence, wealth, and power of a cult.  But I think the script was weak.  This was a chance to really make a statement about cults, about religious predators, their wealth, their tactics, the fact that these kinds of leaders permeate the American landscape, often disguised as \\"mainstream Christian\\" religion, but very very destructive and evil.  But the movie failed in that respect.  I don't think that Scientology, or any of our many mind-control Bible cult leaders, are quaking in their boots (about their tax-exemption) because of this movie.  And none of the potential recruits have been sufficiently warned either....
B007GCY8FS|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT READ FROM LEE CHILDS.  JUST LOVE MR. REACHER'S ADVENTURES BUT ESPECIALLY THE WAY THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THEM !!!

Poorly written, predictable and yes the girl wants to save the boy from himself....I literally laughed out loud at some of the dialogue and I guess that provided some comic relief??
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok so now that I have your attention I would like to say that this game is epic. everything is perfect and runs great on kindle fire.Pc version is better but if you don't want to pay 27$ get this.get it!!!!!!!!updates are coming
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book really put me through the wringer.  It made me hot. It made me angry... and sad. Hopeful. Emotional. Confused. Frustrated. And I mentioned hot, right?  I can say without hesitation that I was completely engrossed.  I sat down, started reading, and didn't stop until it was over.  I couldn't stop.  I had to see how it would all play out.<br /><br />So what happens?  It seems like a lot and not very much at the same time.  The book picks up the day after the events of Bared to You.  Eva and Gideon are trying to make their obsessive relationship work, but they face all the same stumbling blocks: their individual histories of abuse, Gideon's secrets, his jealousy & possessiveness, and Eva's epic insecurities.<br /><br />The sex is, simply put, amazing.  It manages to hit just the right notes for me - dirty but not gratuitous; a little d/s without being BDSM; frequent without being repetitious.  The fact that Sylvia Day does such a good job with this is incredibly important, since the sex is such a huge part of interaction between Gideon and Eva.  The other part --the part that involves their hearts and minds-- is much messier.<br /><br />It would be easy to say that Gideon is the screwed up one here. After all, he basically stalks Eva... tries to control every aspect of her life.  He makes choices that hurt her. He doesn't communicate.  But the thing is -- she takes it.  She stays with him; she craves him; she welcomes his sexual overtures like an eager puppy whose master has been away for a week. All this, even as he wounds her with his behavior and his secrets. It was very hard to read at times, as each of them made destructive decisions and impetuous choices.  With Eva's first person narrative, I hurt when she hurt.  Yet even with insights into her thoughts and feelings, I just couldn't understand how she held on for so long.  Even more confusing and disturbing, though, were Gideon's actions, especially in the second half.<br /><br />I didn't like many of the things they did, but it was all in keeping with how damaged these two people are.  They are at sea --and grasp at each other like life preservers.  Even through all the dysfunction, though, I couldn't look away. I had to know where it would all lead.<br /><br />I said at the beginning that a lot happens --and by that I mean, we finally learn what happened to Gideon in his youth.  Something big happens with Cary.  Something even bigger happens with a pivotal person from Eva's past.  Oh yeah, and my heart broke.  But I also said it seems like not very much happens at the same time.  That's because despite all they go through, I don't know if Eva and Gideon end up in a much better place than they started.<br /><br />The ending is a pretty big deal. I don't think I would call it a cliffhanger, but I think it's the beginning of the end of Eva and Gideon's journey.  A journey I will, no doubt, see through until the last page of the last book.<br /><br />Rating: B+e things they did, but it was all in keeping with how damaged these two people are.

B0085A9HXS|5.0|Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Tony Jaa,......Iko Uwais.<br /><br />I really enjoy martial flicks. I'm young, so I don't have an extensive knowledge, but I have seen nearly every Jackie Chan and Jet Li film made (yes all the vhs dubbed glory that it entails). My list of names at the top is in no way complete, it's just that when I think of badass martial arts, that make me giddy and giggly when watching the mayhem, I think of these people. Iko Uwais has firmly planted himself on this list with The Raid: Redemption.<br /><br />The Raid is a flick that when you break it out for a group of guys that haven't seen it, it will get awesome. It's one of those movies that you have to be vocal during. The fighting is so brutal and darkly funny, that you can't help groaning and laughing. It starts off with lots of gun fighting, then segues into weapon fighting, before culminating with some brutal hand-to-hand. All of this is choreographed so naturalistically and just downright realistic.<br /><br />If you don't like blood and deaths in your martial arts films, then this probably isn't the best choice.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|At first, I was getting sick to my stomach because of the constant roller coaster ride.  I just couldn't figure out how the author was going to make sense of all the loose ends.  But wow, she does - she did.  The ending is great.  Cannot WAIT until the next book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I got a bit hooked on BDSM genre novels after reading the wonderful [[ASIN:B008UCKTL0 SENSATION AND MAGIC - A woman's erotic journey through Submission and Mastery]].  I didn't just want anything in the genre, though, because I am pretty picky about quality, an author's writing ability, and storyline.  A friend suggested I check out Sylvia Day, so I picked up [[ASIN:B00846REIS Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel]] for Kindle.<br /><br />After reading the first Crossfire Novel, I had high expectations for this installment as well.  I was NOT disappointed!  This book has it all, from the sexy billionaire with control issues to the gorgeous heroine who carries lots of baggage.  Each page gives the reader a glimpse of the brokenness they each have and the healing that they receive from the exciting things they do to one another!  While not always easy, they fight for one another in a way that is entirely easy to relate to and extremely admirable.<br /><br />The writing style was exceptional, the characters are so realistic, and the story will keep you up long into the night turning pages.  I highly recommend this book and guarantee you won't be disappointed!
B00884GR0W|4.0|Lots of creation. I LOVE IT. The missions are a little bit hard but it is a lot of fun.
0525953728|5.0|Very informative, and finally we have received a first hand story as to just what transpired.  My only regret (To our government), is that we the public were not furnished with some photos to prove that we did in fact kill this maniac.

0553805371|3.0|I really enjoyed this book, but it read more like a college textbook than a book.  Typical physicists....100+ pages of set up for 50 pages of pay off.  But very informative and interesting.  If you've thought about buying other Hawking books, this book is a great starter given its short length.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was dowloaded on a whim...And it ended up really working out!! This is my favorite game for kindle and cell phone.  I was hooked from day one.

B008G12ERC|5.0|UK rockers Muse sixth album \\"The 2nd Law\\" opens with the theatrical rocker \\"Supremacy\\" sounding very much like a James Bond theme song. \\"Madness\\" is a spare electro song with Queen-style harmonies and a brief squealing guitar solo, unlike anything they have done before, the closest thing to the Dubstep influence the band had threatened. \\"Panic Station\\" is groovy Funk/Disco/Rock with nice scratchy guitars, very Queen (\\"Another One Bites The Dust\\") or Bowie (\\"Fame\\"). \\"prelude\\" is a Classical overture leading to \\"Survival\\", an anthemic battle cry which builds and builds, aptly written as the official song of the London 2012 Olympic Games.<br /><br />\\"Follow Me\\" is a theatrical song with swirling effects and pulsing beats and synths, a song about Bellamy's son. \\"I will keep you safe, I will protect you, I won't let them harm you\\" he reassures his son. \\"Animals\\" is a charming piece with skittery beats and a melodic guitar riff. \\"Explorers\\" is a lovely ballad which starts off spare, builds before ending in a lovely piano coda. \\"Big Freeze\\" recalls U2, \\"Save Me\\" is an anthemic ballad (very Coldplay), and \\"Liquid State\\" is a choppy rocker.<br /><br />Closing are a pair of instrumentals: \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\" (an apocalyptic sounding piece with some narrations and Bellamy wailing) and \\"The 2nd Law: Isolated System\\" (Disco with chiming pianos and snatches of news-style narrations).<br /><br />Good to see a band so deep into their career still sounding so inspired.

B008V4H6N6|4.0|Steven Ellison is US Electronic artist Flying Lotus and his new album \\"Until The Quiet Comes\\" is a woozy psychedelic affair filled with fractured rhythms and trippy synth sounds (\\"Heave(n)\\", \\"Tiny Tortures\\", \\"All The Secrets\\", \\"The Nightcaller\\" to mention a few). It sounds like inter-galactic Jazz.<br /><br />He was brought up in the home of his grandmother, Marilyn McLeod, a Motown producer who penned hits like Diana Ross's \\"Love Hangover\\" and Anita Baker's \\"Same Ole Love\\", while his great-aunt was the late Alice Coltrane, wife of John Coltrane, so he does have a musical pedigree which comes through in his music.<br /><br />All the 18 tracks are brief with a few guests popping up at random; Niki Randa on \\"Getting There\\" and \\"Hunger\\", Erykah Badu on the tribal \\"See Thru to U\\", Thundercat on \\"DMT Song\\", Thom Yorke on the fuzzy tempo-shifting \\"Electric Candyman\\", and Laura Darlington on \\"Phantasm\\". It must be mentioned that the vocals in most cases act as extensions to the elegiac soundscapes, never quite standing out and taking over.<br /><br />Sketchy, spontaneous sounding, yet truly captivating.

B008FSCNTK|4.0|Jazz singer/pianist Diana Krall's new CD \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" is produced by T-Bone Burnett and comprises covers of obscure Jazz and Vaudeville standards from the 20s to 50s. The result is a guitar-heavier Bluesy collection laced with sprinklings of her piano playing. \\"There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth The Salt Of My Tears\\" is a gritty Blues number, while \\"I'm A Little Mixed Up\\" has a touch of Rockabilly.<br /><br />Opening cut \\"We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye\\" is a delicate lilting Jazz piece showcasing her piano playing and dusky vocals. Other standouts include the delicate \\"Just Like a Butterfly That's Caught in the Rain\\", the piano-driven \\"Glad Rag Doll\\", the acoustic ballad \\"Prairie lullaby\\", the Parisienne sounding \\"Here Lies Love\\", \\"Let It Rain\\", the quivery atmospheric Blues \\"Lonely Avenue\\" with a fantastic piano solo (my favourite), and the dramatic waltzing \\"When The Curtain Comes Down\\" with booming spoken segments.<br /><br />Rocking out and purring where necessary, a musical departure of sorts for Ms Krall, but a welcome one.

B005LAII80|5.0|I loved this movie. Like my title said, I don't know anything about Judge Dredd. The comic books or the previous but when my friend took me to see this I just thought is was awesome. I love my action movies and I know this isn't gonna win any awards but if anything just rent it. Worth a watch. I know it flopped when it came out but here's hoping they make it a trilogy.
B008G12ERC|4.0|The big question for Muse's sixth studio album was were they going to release an album full of dubstep tracks, given that they had been hinting about going in this direction as well as declaring a love for dubstep maestro Skrillex. Well yes the album does have elements of dubstep but it has got a whole load of other styles too. Any fears that long time Muse fans had that about the band going completely dubstep were well and truly buried when the first single \\"Survival\\" was released as one of the official tracks for the 2012 Olympics; it was a track that saw the band draw heavily on their Queen influences.<br /><br />In fact \\"The 2nd law\\" features Muse's most funkiest song that they have ever recorded in the excellent \\"Panic Station\\" which is a funk filled slab of funk rock at its finest and sounds like 80's style Red Hot Chili peppers when they hung out with George Clinton as well as a Chuck Mosley fronted Faith No more and a hint of Prince from his 80's best. The second single to be released from the album \\"Madness\\" which features some big electronic beats and a flourish of a guitar solo towards the end is reminiscent of the style of \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" from previous album \\"The Resistance\\".<br /><br />Anybody who thought that Muse had abandoned their guitar roots completely will be happy with opening track \\"Supremacy\\" which opens with a chugging grinding guitar, if there ever was a song suitable for a James Bond movie this one ticks all the boxes. Interestingly bassist Chris Wolstenholme not only writes two tracks for the album but he also takes on lead vocals on both \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Liquid Sate\\". They both deal with his battle with alcoholism. It's a bold move but one that works as Wolestenholme is spot on with his vocal delivery and the tracks sound more like Muse's earlier style. There's no doubting that the final two tracks are the ones that will split Muse fans as they are the dubstep tracks that were promised \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\" and \\"The 2nd Law: Isolated System\\" are two over the top tracks that are dubstep but done in Muse's way, yes there's all the shrieking and bleeping sounds that are familiar with dubstep but with the epicenes of Muse.<br /><br />So \\"The 2nd Law\\" isn't the dubstep album that maybe some thought it would be, only the final two tracks are dubstep and if that's not your thing there is plenty on here that's got all the Muse hallmarks to keep long-time fans happy as well as a few new elements. After all it is Muse and whenever have they not experimented in different styles? They should be applauded for once again trying new things.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|I missed this in the theatre, still enthralled by the spectacle of Avengers and am glad that I did. Kristen Stewart is just so wooden. She acts like she doesn't care about anything, which might've worked for Bella. Chris Hemsworth was all right, playing the strong brute. But the story was justkinda blah for me. If you want a modern retelling of fairy tales, watch Once upon a time. Much more inventive.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Gandhi was a great inspiring film on the accomplishments of Mr. Mahatma Gandhi, but just as the opening of the film mentions, \\"No man's life can encompassed in one telling\\". Gandhi found a way to the hearts of many people with his practices and beliefs.<br />Crowds and crowds of people gathered at the chance to meet one man in the hopes of being graced by his presence, and in an instance he was shot to death. Once again bringing a whole country together to grieve this great man. Gandhi was not a commander of armies or a man of vast lands but this did not stop the people of India from gathering together to pay homage to him. Mr. Mahatma Gandhi led his people and family to freedom, and it would be hard for generations to come to believe such man of this greatness walked the earth.<br />Beginning in Southern Africa Gandhi was looked at as a colored attorney that received little respect. Gandhi wanted to fight for the belief that they were all children of God's whether they were Hindus or Christians they still had the right to be looked at as equal citizens just as the Christians. Gandhi's friends told him this would cause trouble which lead to one of many of Gandhi's arrest. Mahatma Gandhi again did not wish for harm of any kind only for their rights as citizens. Throughout this trial in Mr. Gandhi's life he meets Charlie Andrews which would be an influential part in Gandhi's quest back to India.<br />Gandhi was always willing to show courage in the hopes that a person's hatred may decrease and their respect will increase. He lived and practiced the idea that people could live together. At first Gandhi felt like India was an alien country to him. Meanwhile he took it upon himself to truly discover India.  In his last year, unhappy at the partition of India, Gandhi worked to stop the carnage between Muslims on the one hand and Hindus and Sikhs that raged in the border area between India and Pakistan. He was assassinated on 30 January 1948 by a Hindu nationalist who thought Gandhi was too sympathetic to India's Muslims. Mr. Mahatma Gandhi is still known in India as the Father of the Nation. It is important to know that Gandhi never looked at himself as being bigger than any situation in India instead he truly lived and died for what he believed was religiously right.

B003LXSY60|5.0|I recently discovered The Black Keys, and I am instantly hooked! With all the crappy music on the market, discovering the Brothers album has been eye opening. It reminds me of the blues of George Thorogood's 70's albums, with the feel of the classic rock/blues band Free. Ok, I'm showing my age a bit. Great Album.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Wow, I just can't believe all the negative/hateful reviews for this amazing set based on a few gripes. Welcome to SW fandom!!<br /><br />The set is incredible. I'd have liked some different extras in a few cases but you don't buy a movie for the extras. Everything looks great and the movies are all amazing.<br /><br />My take on the series:<br /><br />The Phantom Menace: A brilliant film on many levels but it is an acquired taste. However, it has been unfairly maligned and has become a convenient whipping-boy for angry \\"fans\\". The film is visually extraordinary, rich with ideas, fun to watch and kids love it.<br /><br />Attack of the Clones: Another film that has become a convenient excuse for internet geeks to complain and hurl insults. The love story is weak but the film as whole is strong. It advances the story of the first trilogy well, is quite complex, and every frame is a pleasure to look at. Again, brilliant on many levels.<br /><br />Revenge of the Sith: As good as any of the originals. Truly epic.<br /><br />A New Hope: In my opinion the best of the series. Just a perfect movie that works on every level. It still looks beautiful.<br /><br />Empire Strikes Back: Everyone's favorite but not mine. There is no plot, very little story, it's always cutting away from the interesting material to focus on Han & Leia, bland characters who remain static from beginning to end. Disappointing visuals  - not the photography or special effects, just the way Kershner shot it, like television. And all that dry ice - it's like the freakin' Ice Capades! Endless fog & smoke machines & dry ice. Pretty dull. But still, an entertaining SW movie with lots of great moments.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi: Really perfect. I prefer Richard Marquand to Irvin Kershner as a director. The world he creates is visually stylish, intriguing, mysterious, colorful and fun. You want to revisit it over and again.<br /><br />There you go. The best series of fantasy films ever produced. Don't listen to the negativity and endless complaining of career \\"fans\\". It's a great set and six great movies.<br /><br />PS: If you're thinking of leaving some kind of insulting comment, don't waste my time or yours. Just post your own review. Thanks.

Very inspiring as well to hear the inside story of TRUE American heroes fighting on the front lines of this terror war.  THEY ALL deserve the Medal of Honor for their many years of service.

B00913DPW2|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It had an interesting story line, nice graphics and good puzzles. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because there were several annoying program glitches. For example, any time I opened the trunk in the living room, all the doors to the room became inoperable and I had to shut down and restart the Kindle to continue playing. That said, I am looking forward to the Haunt 2. I really like games that resemble  the &quot;Myst&quot; genre and hope to see more on Kindle.
B005LAIH2W|1.0|In my opinion this movie made no sense, the plot was messed up, people randomly appeared and was never seen again that at first seemed as though they were going to be important. Basically it made no since. In the trailer they show this crazy bloody fight with two beasts and a man when in the movie, its probably a 10 second clip and means nothing. After seeing the movie the group i went with turned, starred at each other in disgust and couldn't believe we had wasted our money on this.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Downton Abbey is truly a beautiful masterpiece.  This is as good a period piece as I have ever seen in film or TV.  The grand sets and costuming transport the viewer to a bygone age of manners and wit.  The dialogue is snappy and the storylines are incomparable.  You will fall in love with the characters and embrace them (aristocracy and service staff) as members of your own family.  The acting is also top-notch and one waits on the edge of his/her tongue for the crack of every one of Maggie Smith's lines.  What a delight to experience and immerse yourself in the treasure that is Downton Abbey.

B005IQZB14|4.0|A great story, fell in love with Cheryl and connected with her more then I thought I would. Have recommended this book to my friends and family.
0671042858|3.0|They say \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover\\", but in this case, you can. It looks like a story about a girl lost in the woods, and that's what it is. To me, it's an extremely difficult task to keep a book entertaining for 250 pages while a girl tries to find her way. I'm not really a big fan of the psychological aspect. I prefer dialogue and characters, and perhaps that's why the story was just average to me. If you're a big fan of pyscholigical horror/suspense, then you would likely enjoy it more.<br />Going into the book, I knew what it was. It wasn't great, but I wasn't disappointed because I didn't expect it to be. It's a good contrast to many of King's brick-sized books with many characters and situations. It's something different, not good or bad, but I much prefer the stories like \\"Needful Things\\" where the whole town is involved.<br />I gave the book three stars because it was neither bad nor great. According the the rating system, three stars means \\"okay\\", and that's what this was to me. I ended up getting into the book more as it got closer to ending, probably because I knew by then something HAD to happen. However, the climax was rather quick, over before you know it.<br />Overall, King did keep this book just entertaining enough to enjoy, as his witty writing willl throw in a light-hearted moment at the right time, and I give him credit for taking an incredibly simple plot and keeping it as enjoyable as it was, even if it wasn't amazing. I don't regret reading it, but I also don't think I'll be re-reading it sometime in the future.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I had so much fun playing Rayman on video consoles, when I saw this in the store, I couldn't wait to download it!! this game is so much fun, and I hope you come out with more versions. It's easy to pick up but hard to put down. Kids of all ages will love this!! it definitely earned the 5 stars I'm giving it, and I highly recommend it. I'm playing on at to Toshiba thrive. Have fun :-D
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I thought that it was a really great read and how the SEAL's worked and how they were being used by Washington for political gain.  To me, there was nothing 'classified' in the book - just how the training took place, the helicopter crash, the actual kill of OBL.  How good old teamwork and the preparation went into the mission.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Although there are many variations of the Snow White fairy tale, this version strays quite far from all of them. A kernel of original story remains in this film but not by much. 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is not your kiddie fairy tale and parents need to be warned not to take little kids to this film. Some parents are very dense though. My local theater had to post warnings at the theater entrance that the movie was not for children. This version has been rewritten as an action adventure complete with haunted forests, a CGI troll, great battle scenes, and many many deaths. We even get to see Kristen Steward in a Joan of Arc getup. It is filmed with exqusitely beautiful scenery of the UK's Marloes Sands and a British coastline with a CGI castle added.<br /><br />The film begins with an excellent revision of the beginning of the Snow White tale. King Magnus, widowed and in lonely pain, rescues a beautiful woman named Ravenna who is held prisoner by a supernatural army. He brings her back to his castle. Played by Charlize Theron, the viewer can sense that Ravenna is not as she seems. Snow White, the king's daughter senses this from the start. Ravenna cleans up real good, seduces the king, marries him and kills him on their wedding night. Ravenna and her army take over the kingdom and imprison the young Snow White in the tower.<br /><br />'Snow White and the Huntsman' is a decent film even though much of the middle and end of the film feels somewhat forced. It is highlighted by great acting from a superb supporting cast; Charlize Theron in an other-the-top performance is excellent, Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman and Sam Claflin as Ravenna's brother are also both excellent. In fact the entire cast is very good except fot Kristen Stewart as Snow White. Stewart was a bad casting choice considering the other better actresses that were considered for the role. Her performance is flat and unconvincing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me on the \\"edge of my seat\\" to see what happens next!<br />Well written, too!<br />I's a fast read and I would purchase it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this when I ordered it, it isn't the type of book I generally read.  I'm so glad I did.  It is one of the most disturbing, thought-provoking, and well-written books I've ever read.  I remember having the same type of reaction to Lord of the Flies, maybe some parallels can be drawn.  My mind has returned to it again and again, even at the oddest moments.  Seldom does a work of fiction remain with me in such a manner.  Wool may become a classic piece of literature.  It makes so many statements about the development of society, the human condition, and human nature; not all of it pretty.  The plot was well rounded, the characters fully developed.  There is so much more that can be said of this book but I think you should just read it.  My congratulations to the author for an excellent series.
B007JRU2UK|2.0|I gave this movie a two because I fell asleep during this movie on two occasions. I will probably not be renting it a third time.
0553386794|5.0|This first volume is very complex and big (835 pages in paperback), but not nearly as big as the ones that follow. Its main purpose is to make the characters and their plot-lines familiar to the readers, so that they can easily dive in this fantasy universe that is so special, unique and simply delicious that it's impossible not to become addictive.<br /><br />The first conclusion after reading A Game of Thrones is that it's useless trying to summarize it. There are so many characters involved and they all have their background stories, they all belong to a major or minor house in The Seven Kingdoms and they all pursue their own goals. The story is told from the point of view of eight main characters, thus the plot-lines developing in parallel, in different parts of Martin's fantasy world: Lord Eddard Stark, Lady Catelyn Stark, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Bran Stark, Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen. There are three major plot-lines according to the locations where the action takes place: in the Seven Kingdoms, on the Wall and across the Narrow Sea.<br /><br />In the Seven Kingdoms, King Robert Baratheon comes in the north to ask Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, to be the Hand of the King. Though he loathes leaving his peaceful life and beautiful family behind, Lord Stark has to obey his king and go in the south with his two daughters, Sansa and Arya, even when his youngest son mysteriously falls off a high tower and goes into a deep sleep. His wife, Catelyn, is left with three sons: Robb, the eldest, Bran, who is invalid, and Rickon. Jon Snow, Eddard Stark's bastard son, decides to join the Night's Watch to protect the realm from the wild people and creatures beyond the Wall. And this is, basically, how a game of cat and mouse between two major houses (Stark and Lannister) begins, the first trying to protect a useless king and the other trying to take his throne.<br /><br />All the while, in the East, across the Narrow Sea, Viserys Targaryen does everything in his power to raise an army and take back what's rightfully his, the Seven Kingdoms, for he is the true heir of the Iron Throne. He sells his own sister, Daenerys, to a Dothraki warlord, Khal Drogo, in exchange for the army he needs. But he makes mistake after mistake and Daenerys proves to be smarter than him. Also, she's got three petrified dragon eggs. Are they just useless stones or do dragons still exist?<br /><br />The Night's Watch is the only one that doesn't care about kings and thrones. Its purpose is to protect Westeros of what lies beyond the Wall and rumors say that they have to fear more than just some tribes of wild, ragged people. There are these creatures, which legends call Others, that bring cold, smell like pure, savage winter, have sparkling blue eyes and can only be killed by fire.<br />All in all, A Game of Thrones is an amazing must-read that ends in such a cliffhanger that you have to grab the next book in the series A Song of Ice and Fire - A Clash of Kings. George R.R. Martin succeeded in creating an addictive universe with strong, determined characters that are so complex you come to the conclusion that there might just not be any bad characters, but just some people who're trying to outsmart their rivals.rything in his power to raise an army and take back what's rightfully his, the Seven Kingdoms, for he is the true heir of the Iron Throne.

0812567110|4.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.<br /> Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.<br /> The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.<br />  I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most.\\" life would be.

B009JBZH54|4.0|To be honest right up front, I enjoyed the Avengers more, but am not a Nolan hater.  I'm also not a Nolanite worshipper.  As a fan of hero comics, the Dark Knight trilogy is my favorite Batman compilation.  The stories are awesome and  right on par with the Dark Knight Comics.  I only have the Marvel movies on blu ray but will be looking forward to adding this set to my collection.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Nice and entertaining game, and the best part is that if you carry out the quests and other tasks you do not even have to spend money on it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It's hard to review a book without giving away too much.  Stieg Larsson does a very good job and portraying the characters and their thoughts and motives as the book progresses.  There are a few moments in the book where my mouth fell open, astonished at what I had just found out and other moments had my heart racing and me on the edge of my seat.  The book starts off with so many questions and slowly answers them but it is really engaging and you find yourself being the detective, trying to piece together the clues and solve what happened.  It is a very hard book to put down and keeps you thinking about it and wanting more afterwards.  I am about to read the third book to conclude the trilogy.  As with the first book, I recommend The Girl Who Played With Fire, you will not be disappointed.
B00138JAB8|5.0|This is a great album, however, what Sony seriously needs to do is remaster the original true stereo version.  So what if the vocals are on the left and the guitar is on the right.  Yeah, the hard separation doesn't sound good on headphones but, the clarity sounds much better on nice stereo speakers.  The sound of the remaster is great but, if you're upgrading from the original CD, you'll still want to keep that disc.  It was in stereo.  The remastered version was released only in mono.
1451648537|5.0|Isaacson has written an outstanding biography of this most iconic figure in modern American technology.  The research, including many interviews with Jobs [who sanctioned Isaacson to write this, and cooperated] and nearly everyone who knew or worked with him, is clearly meticulous and thorough.  He does a dazzling job of taking us through the various stages of Jobs' career and puts in plain words that a non-techie can understand all of the intricacies of Apple product development.  He doesn't sugar-coat Jobs' irascible behavior or his weird idiosyncrasies which makes the story all the more powerful.  The book is about 100 pages too long due to Isaacson's tendency to repeat himself on some points but that is a small complaint.<br /><br />I will say I wish there had been a bit more about the loved ones in his life: his adoptive parents drop out of the picture early on even though Jobs loved them dearly and was inspired to his perfectionism at least partially by his adoptive father whom he respected and revered; likewise, we learn little about his wife other than her inability to cajole him into doing things he didn't want to do; his adoptive sister  is mentioned only once or twice; his relationship with his children is analyzed but not enough to give a true picture.  Finally, I wish there had been more about his travels and true friendships and how that influenced  him [or not].<br /><br />At its core, this is an elegy and as such, it is, in a way, a sad tale. Had Jobs lived, his visionary abilities would have continued to transform our lives in remarkable ways. It  makes you ache to wonder where he would have taken us next.

B0099114WO|5.0|Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, and Steve Carell prove their worth as actors in roles they seldom play, but they all did a stellar job. As usual for these box-office hit professionals. Carell as Dr. Feld who takes a week to turn a stagnant 31-yr-old marriage on it's un-bridled love heals. Kay and Arnold are the couple who have to face marriage sexual reality in front of a shrink. Viewers feel as awkward as the characters are portrayed. Good acting makes this good story achieve greatness.<br /><br />It's scenic, since the Omaha couple travel to Great Hope Springs, Maine for the intense week of therapy. And it's quite believable. It's emotional, like the struggles and high points of a real marriage after 31 years. In Feld's office, it goes from pathetic to comic. Intense to relief. Moments of endearment and others where the revelations become loud and in-your-face. Sometimes I wished I could hide myself, other moments I squeezed my wife's knee. She watched in the theater seat beside me. She immediately informed me we must buy the DVD when available.<br /><br />OK, it's not for all. It's targeting older, mature viewers.<br />Teens will growl \\"gross\\" during the clothed sex scenes.<br />Young marrieds may envision their parents or grandparents.<br />Ladies 40 & over will find it lusciously romantic.<br />Older men will/can learn a few tips to sweeten your own sweetie. Works for me, 64 and alive.<br />Anyone calling this well acted encounter \\"far fetched\\" just isn't old enough to have been there...yet.

B0035G04TI|3.0|It's pretty simplistic, though logical and exactly what you'd expect by the title. I was hoping for something that would inspire me to think and perhaps teach me something new, but the points made in the book are just setting outlines/limits/definitions on anyone who was raised to respect the Golden Rule already knows.
0439023483|5.0|I love this book! Read it in 3 days since I couldn't put it down. I always had to know what was coming next. Very interesting concept and fast-paced action.
B003XU7VM4|3.0|If you're looking for a Castle episode in book format, this book is for you. If, like me, you were hoping for a unique story, a great mystery, and something that isn't a cutesy re-hashing of a TV show, skip this one. I was really hoping that this would be a good mystery, as Richard Castle is painted (within the show, and in meta format) as a best-selling, talented writer along the lines of James Patterson. I was thinking that a good solid mystery novel with Nikki Heat would make me respect the character of Richard Castle more. Sadly, the book is just like the show. Do we need a Mary Sue character of a fictional character, mirroring the book plot to the plot of every script of the TV show Castle? Nope.

0345535421|4.0|The pacing is slow at times, mainly because Martin fills the book with (let's face it) more characters than he can reasonably handle. That being said, he does cram a lot of politics and action in, even when done ponderously. My heart is with the Stark kids, and he does a fantastic job of drawing solid lines between the Good Guys and the Bad Guys, and keeping a clutch of folks in the grey borders. I look forward to continuing the series.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|It was very easy to order the movie online. The site  was secure with my information. I recieved the movie on my birthday, watched it that night! I love this movie!
0553386794|4.0|Reading this while watching season 1 on HBO improved my enjoyment of the epic. I am definitely a fan of several characters, and can't wait to see what Martin does with them over the next several books. This one is a bit hefty, but it didn't bog down as much as I expected it to. I'd recommend it to all fans of classic fantasy and large-scale court intrigue/epic battle stories. (I will say, I think the portrayal of characters in the HBO series is even better than their written characters, and I would likely not have picked this up if I didn't love the HBO show so much)
0525953728|5.0|Mark Owen tells why it is \\"no easy day\\" in the life of a Navy SEAL or for that matter, a day in the life of our servicemen & women.  Without all the testosterone filled machismo or bravado, Mark Owen takes the reader inside all the hard work it takes to make it to SEAL Team 6, what it takes to stay there, the sacrifices of time with family, the continous training & the missions themselves.  Definitely no easy day!<br /><br />Excellent read.  Loved how the author conveyed the fact that even though there are different branches of the military, it is an overall team effort to ensure that we continue to pursue \\"Life, Liberty & the Pursuit of Happiness\\".
B001SRC9P8|2.0|I'm a fan of the TV show, so I had high hopes for this one, but sadly, it's not as compelling. It's a fluff story, Sweet Valley High-level. It gives me hope that the following books improve, and I picked up the next two on discount so we'll see. But as for this one...the characters are beyond vapid and shallow, even for high schoolers, and it takes a stretch of the imagination to believe high schoolers would have that much cash on hand all the time (or parents so....childish). But then, I didn't grow up on the East Coast in private school. Anyway, it works as a quick distraction, but overall I'd recommend just watching the TV show.
030758836X|5.0|The best of Gillian's books in my opinion! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little bit of mmystery and great writing!
1400064627|5.0|Fannie Flagg is definitely a storyteller. In the style of Garrison Keilor and other \\"old-time\\" storytellers, she weaves a story about a town, and the people within it, with graceful ease. Each character has a distinctive voice, and the book is filled with well-blended humor and poignancy. It captures an era (ok, several eras), and is compelling in the diversity of personalities (that somehow stay contemporary in design). I really enjoyed this (much better than the movie!), and I recommend it for anyone looking for a touching and mostly-cheerful light read.
0525953728|5.0|Reading several of the already written positive reviews, I pretty much agree.  This was a great book written simply, and a \\"not being able to be put down\\" book.  I really enjoyed it, BUT...<br /><br />I really wish he hadn't slammed Obama, albeit indirectly at the end of the book.<br />It really destroyed the mood for me, and I am sad about that.  I wish he understood that if the raid had failed, Obama would have been excoriated for that.  He made no mention of Obama making the final decision to go ahead with the mission being advised by several of his cabinet NOT to attempt it. That had to take some courage.<br /><br />Forgetting that, it was a fantastic reading experience, and my admiration for the SEALS, SEAL TEAM SIX, and Mark Owen, Matt B.,is off-the-charts. As the Admiral in THE BRIDGES OF TOKI RI said on the bridge of an aircraft carrier during the Korean War, \\"Where do we get such men?\\" Indeed.

160774273X|1.0|After reading the rave reviews of Flour Water Salt Yeast, I purchased the book.  What a big disappointment it is.  There are very few recipes, loads of photos, lots of detail but his method of making levain is just too much.  Over 5 days it takes 2500 grams of flour, throwing out 3/4 of the mixture daily, then you need to feed the levain daily if you want to keep it active. This amounts to over 10 1/2cups of flour!  Interesting that my exact same dough bucket weighs much less than his.  I did try the Walnut Bread with some success using my starter but threw out the Pain De Campagne using the author's starter before it even got to the shaping stage.  What a huge waste of flour.  While I am certainly not a professional baker, I have been baking bread for 50 years with good results, especially using my own starter made with pineapple juice and  a small amount of whole wheat flour.  If anyone wants my copy they are welcome to it.

B007VDN1PA|4.0|We received this product and read the manual which was terribky written. After about 30 minutes of fiddling around we figured out how to use it. The unit worked great and the images produced from very old slides were phenominal. One thing that it does not do is allow you to scan the image directly to your computer. You can remove the SD Media and upload to your pc or you can hook up the usb connector and copy the images from the unit to the pc. Unlike other people we do not find the option to link to the PC valuable. Stick to the SD card as the process is much faster and you can manage your images using your favorit picture editor.<br /><br />I will say the the company who provides support for the product (Not the manufacturer) responded quickly and sent a revised user manual which was greatly improved. They did ststae that the unit is not designed to upload directly to a computer so Amazon should edit their copy on this product.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 starts except for the manual and the inability to directly upload to the PC.
