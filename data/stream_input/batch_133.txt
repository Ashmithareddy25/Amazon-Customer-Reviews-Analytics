B004I1H59Q|1|does not work properly in e90 vehicles with adaptive xenon headlamps. It was past the return period before a mechanic informed me of the issue. This detail needs to be included in the product description.
B007OZL04O|5|This tool works great keeps from cross threading lug bolts
B00C8907AE|4|Nice Helmet for the money, good fit, nice look, convertible feature is nice for different types of rides. Wind noise is a little loud, but again for $100 buck it's nice.
B0021I2C2I|5|Work great!!
B0039Y6IUA|5|Great to put on a car window. Seems like it will last a long time.
B008IXN4RW|5|Excellent product, My shoes look clean a fresh!
B009YEYM6Q|5|As described
B003PB46CY|3|It seems to work fine and is not too noisy. Used as a backup to my engine fan and is on manual switch. Product is fine, but ad presentation is a problem. I wanted a 16&#34; but after reading &#34;additional information&#34;  page I downsized to a 14&#34; due to listed &#34;product dimensions&#34;.  After I received the fan I discovered the dimensions listed were for the packaging not the fan!!! I could have go with a 16&#34; after all!
B00D9H2YXC|4|okay
B0082JZYI4|5|Easy to find and just what we needed
B001CEG90I|2|Did not fit my vehicle.
B001EMRU24|5|Just perfect!!!
B00I7ELSSY|5|Works great!
B000CAZW74|2|poor welding angle was not right
B001AI1ERE|5|Sounds so good on my 2010 wide glide
B0002STSTE|5|Works as advertised.
B006WQS71U|5|Fit my 94 Mazda Miata first try.  No more squeak squeak. Would I buy again, probably just to stock up and make sure I don't have to scramble to get another one 10 years down the road.
B001H3NGKA|5|Great for hiking on hot day
B009MLO284|5|Looks great. Built tuff! Bargain priced.
B00077U7EU|5|Great site!
B000COBXPA|5|Works well and doesnt damage the tree like your winch cabke would. Highly recommended
B000SL4AA2|4|Inflation works well, but the pressure gauge could be a little more accurate. Overall, excellent for an air emergency.
B009PUCRCA|3|It was what I expected.
B00BCRM9YA|4|Received my order before expected delivery time. Looks and fits great in my Hyundai Elantra.
B00FFI7UAU|4|Thin but it works
B0006IX87S|5|Water tastes better with this filter.
B00F0M5Q20|5|easy to install, looks great
B00SNCYQL6|5|I have a huge head and it fits and looks great. ALL the girls love it.
B007D7QMM8|4|Pretty good stuff
B0054KWONM|5|Worked perfect.. Easy to setup up .
B00VSC6CWO|5|Great product, Wasn't sure what size to pick?! contacted, they responded immediately with the right size for my car. Very helpful! They even sent me a clip that shows mounting and installation procedures as well as proper application! Serves the purpose way better than others! Love it!
B00CA2YG7E|4|It worked ok happy with it
B00I5056VA|4|Worked great. Only problem was they were not marked like the directions said they were  as to which way they face to bolt to the body.
B0116GZQB4|5|Pretty nice option for 12v usb power with dealing with inverters. Its very well designed, you can tell most of the money making this is spent on weather proofing, because believe me, no water is getting in there. My only gripe is the power cable is 18 gauge. If you're using all of the 2.1 amp per port you are pushing the limits of the wire and creating excess heat. It's still technically safe, but I'd have gone a little beefier for peace of mind.<br />Other than than extra step, it performs as intended without hiccups. 5/5<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for a honest review.
B00YE019B6|3|Not bad
B000Q08SLC|5|This is actually an OEM manufacturer for Honda.  This is the only replacement belt that will fit my Honda correctly.  I first bought a different brand and learned quickly that it did not work, even though the maker said it would.  This Bando belt is highly discounted over the same item available from the dealer.
B008VJ9URQ|5|Very good item,
B00D61HKPI|1|This is the 2nd set of rear window deflectors I had to purchase as one of the previous deflectors flew off on the highway. The company would not send a replacement and said it wasn't covered with the warranty. So I had to order the 2nd set ( I only needed the left passenger side ) and I was also given additional tape for installation. Today, that same passenger side deflector had slid down the window!
B006N91C2M|5|Fits perfectly in my E36 convertible, which needs a special battery. Can't argue with the price, compared to BMW.
B001DXG7QO|5|Perfect seller transaction.  Excellent product - PIAA 30725 Black Aluminum Tubular Mounting...stronger than expected, excellent design
B0052SF0LO|2|These came to me with all working parts, and they worked out of the box.  But within a month of having them mounted, they began to fail.  Either the batteries are not charging, or the electronics don't work.  Out of the 6 that I purchased, only 3 are still in service today, and that's because I had to work on them in some way.  When they work, they work great.  Love the brilliantly bright light, and the ability to control the sensitivity of the motion sensor.  I am looking to buy replacements, but won't be buying these again.
B00MRMJURS|5|I didn't know these were even made, nice addition to an already fantastic car. I like the added security and get compliments all the time. That is why I think it was a wise purchase on my part to buy these caps. Price was so nice that I also bought these with the black BMW logo. Amazon has done it again.
B001A0MSU4|2|They did what I needed! But not the best for a restoration
B000C7S062|5|I bought this for my neighbor's jeep and I helped him install it.  It was a perfect fit and installation was very quick and easy.  All hose and line fittings were exact and every screw hole matched right up.  The price was incredibly cheaper than the dealership, and even beat O'reilly, AutoZone, Advance Auto Parts, and PartsGeek.  I'm not a fan of plastic radiators, but the build quality looked as good as the factory radiator we took out.  I hope it lasts as long too... but time will tell.
B00TH8KRP4|5|Love scruffy bird.
B0035R0TEC|4|Need the right oil filter wrench to tighten.  Don't over tighten.
B00E3ZAY0O|4|I originally was going to go with 3 stars, but upped it to 4 because of the great service given by the vendor Amazinea.  One of the lights I purchased didn't work properly, and was very promptly replaced with one that works perfectly.  The product itself gets 3 stars, but I added one for the great customer service I got.  I just e-mailed them a picture of the defective/broken light, and they sent me a new one, no questions asked.<br />The lights themselves are good.  Decently made, they seem to be sealed well.  At first I thought the wires seemed thin, but on farther thought, these are LED lights, and draw so little electricity that thin wires are all they need.  Be sure to read the description, as the lights are pretty small, but bright enough.  They appear to be white at first glance, but they light up a nice bright red.  The 'taillight' brightness level isn't all that bright, it can be hard to see in bright sunlight (but you don't normally have the taillights on on bright sunny days) but the 'brakelight' brightness is enough to be seen even on the brightest days.  The light won't overwhelm you, but it is enough to be seen easily.  They mount to any flat surface by drilling two small holes, one for the mounting bolt, and another for the wires.  The mounting bolt is permanently mounted to the light, as are the wires (which also appear to be sealed into place)  Just drill 2 little holes about 1/2 or 3/4 inch apart, thread the wires through one and the bolt through the other.  Snug the bolt, and hook the wires, and you are ready to go.<br />Just remember:<br />black is ground<br />Green is the dimmer 'taillight' power lead<br />Red is brighter 'brake' light lead<br /><br />Bright enough for my ATV trailer, draws very little power, seems weatherproof, and at a great price.<br />If I pulled a trailer everyday, I might have gone with bigger lights, but these are fine for my uses.
B001MP2V9K|5|Exact replacement, even came with wiring harness and bulbs. Price was great.
B0002M9QRE|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE my new headlights. The install was as easy as changing a sealed beam that had burned out. Which will be a lot easier now. Before I had to remove 21 screws just to change one light. But now all I'll have to do is pop the hood disconnect the the plug-in unscrew the the bulb. Awesome!!!!!
B004C65DYQ|5|Disclaimer: No...I am not a professional mechanic or a Toyota sales/service rep. However, I am a discriminating consumer who recently purchased a '12 RAV4 V6 and love it. Understandably then, I was particular when it came to searching for a premium-quality oil filter for my spunky little jack rabbit RAV.
B007Q7SWF0|5|Looks awesome. Shouldn't have to drill in frame. Even though you have to to completely install the mount. I didn't. Just bolted it up and retightened a week later. Does its job.
B00TSN4OZM|3|I love the skull but I had to drill a new hole because they did not line up and it didn't come with the foam ring so I had to make one of those. For the price I expected more.
B001RMT5Q0|2|Four and a half star Amazon reviews don't usually lead me astray.  I had a friend order these to install on her car, as one was collision damaged.  These assemblies got the job done (with a lot of extra effort on my part) but I wouldn't buy them again.<br /><br />First:  These assemblies DO NOT INCLUDE THE WIRING HARNESS.  If your wiring harness or plugs are damaged in any way (like from a collision...) you need more than just this set.  And none of the auto parts suppliers seem to carry the correct plugs for an '03 Taurus, so you'll need to find a wrecking yard.<br /><br />The Good:  The fit to the body is very nice--no problems installing them at all.  Build quality overall seems very good for the money.  They look good on the car.<br /><br />The Bad:  Fit to the factory wiring harness is mediocre at best--as another review noted, the plastic is thinner than the factory headlight assemblies, so the plugs snap into place rather loosely (especially the turn signal plug).  They haven't fallen out so far, and if it's a problem I guess I could use a dab of silicone to hold them, but fit this poor is unacceptable, and it's vexing that the manufacturer otherwise seems to have gotten these right.<br /><br />All in all, it would have been worth the extra money to get a complete assembly from the local parts store.<br /><br />Tip:  You can usually reuse the one way lock fasteners that hold the tabs to secure the factory harness...if you pry around the edges with a screwdriver you can basically turn them &#34;inside out&#34; and pull them off, then put them back on the new assembly &#34;backwards&#34; and they will hold.
B00NBH6814|5|Great deal and bright lights. They've been working great!
B000C2EFV6|5|The fit and quality is good, no problems.
B0002NIJ6M|5|Wish there were a slightly larger size!  Magnetized bullet holes are darn near impossible to find!
B00CKINHVO|5|Excellent fit prompt service very good price on the mirror ed
B000P16VZ2|5|Works Great
B00JIM5Z8I|1|This key shell arrived on time (which was 15 days shipping from china) and was in good condition. However, the spring in this is junk. I used the key before i took it apart and it was awesome. The key sprung open fast and it looked nice, but as soon as i took it apart the spring bend and basically broke to a point that the whole key shell was unusable. i would suggest going to your dealer because this does not work.
B007PP03R8|5|Worked great for my Shelves!!
B002H8U3KK|5|Just what I needed at the best price you're going to find.
B000CB1KN8|5|perfect fit. did the trick.
B00WS2ZJ2C|5|AAAAAAA+++ fast and as discribed
B00E6A5NGG|1|Stretched out of proportion while applying. Poor quality that isn't easy to apply without bubbles.
B006M45DGY|5|An AMAZING product and was the perfect gift. The quality was way better than advertized!
B003F2BWMU|5|Nice, perfect fit
B00429NKWK|5|5 minutes of head sanding is a long time.  40 mins total.  But what an amazing difference.  Highly recommended.  Wished I had taken pictures
B00F47YON8|5|I recommend are very good
B00KENHOL6|1|All of the aluminum pieces turned a rust brown after about 3 weeks.  Would not purchase again
B00HH3TIM4|5|Totally cute.
B000GKD5NI|5|Love it...
B00ATPESOU|5|Got lots of compliments on this sticker
B009HX77WU|4|The hinges work really nice. The finish is decent. The only problem I had was that the one mounting hole in the door didn't line up quite right. I had to retap the door nut at an angle to get the screw in.
B0065J3368|5|I love this.  It solves the problem of checking tire pressure in a very straight forward way.
B000C5WCY0|5|I asked whether it would fit my 99 LE V6 Camry at the Amazon site and received several answers from the previous buyers/owners,  I took the advice and bought the sensor as the price was substantially lower than I could get from local auto parts stores. The sensor arrived fast.  However, the plastic wrap was already opened and the part seemed to have been used before (according to Amazon, the part is new.)  I did not install the sensor myself as it was for Bank 1 cylinders (it is very hard to reach.  Need to raise the car to reach the broken sensor from the bottom that is located at the back of the engine).  Brought it to a local gas station.  They only charged me a small fee for installation.  It worked and the engine light was gone immediately!
B0038DAZM4|5|Fast Shipping and exactly how described!
B00OAD8FNW|5|great item..great shipping...
B000RFSARI|5|This thing does a great job and makes it easy to do a nasty job.
B001MQ01PK|5|Best product on the market!
B0046AOV8M|5|I expected this magnetic cup holder to be OK, but it is really great.  I expected the magnet to be a bit weak, considering the size of the bottles that can be held, but this really stays stuck to any steel.  There appear to be 4 magnets arranged vertically on the rear of the holder.  The magnets are covered with a  rubberized tape-like material so that your surface is less likely to be scratched.  The holder is generously sized so that a foam insulator sleeve on a standard soft drink can easily fits.  I waited to write this review after using the holder a full week while working on a compact ag tractor.  The holder magnetically stuck to a vertical steel square post on the tractor front loader, which gets a lot of bumps during a typical work day.  I filled a 16 oz metal thermos water bottle with a foam cozy sleeve 3 times a day, dropping it into the holder more than a dozen times each day.  The magnetic holder did not budge for the whole week.  Nice!  There are two drain holes in the bottom of the holder, so I don't even have to worry about rain accumulation.  This is a simple but very reliable product.  Well done.
B002G47GE6|3|Great fit for 2006 Passat but don't last long. Under 6 months.
B000BROATE|5|This receiver extender is awesome. Built VERY well. Bought it for motorhome to extend bike rack. Fits perfect. My husband couldn't believe how stout it is. We are very happy with this purchase and would recommend it.
B00G49DVGG|5|I was worried the smell would be too strong at first, but it totally wasn't in my opinion. In addition to &#34;killing&#34; any odors, I really enjoy the clean scent it left behind. I definitely plan on buying more.
B00KLKR3PY|5|Worked exactly as described. Wasnt sure it would be the correct one but it did the job!
B004NSLPCC|4|They fit and work like original
B00LIC1MXI|5|Looks awesome hanging on my office wall
B0000AXMDP|5|good stuff
B001EOV492|5|Worked great.  Towed a 8'x5' trailer from PA to MO.  No issues.
B000C9VTRC|5|Works as it supposed to. No problems
B00X012AZO|5|Great product for the price
B000WK608Y|5|A must have when taking trips. Looks great on the bike and it keeps the old lady from trying to hug me and trying to rub you know what on my back!! LOL
B004I8M03K|5|Great value.  The lights are exactly as advertised and fit perfectly in my Dodge 2500 truck.  They even came with light bulbs which I didn't expect.
B002ZKM2DQ|5|This unit is noticeably more quiet than the OEM.
B0009IBJBM|5|works great on my Ford 8n. Nice product, great price. hard to find 6 volt output
B00MQP6TCA|5|Item was packaged as genuine Mopar accessory.  It did have 3-M tape and went on in seconds. Super easy and exactly what I wanted.  Thanks!
B00FZ5IJRG|5|Awesome product
B003LDROGG|5|they got fast to ur home. Easy to instaled. Good quality. And they are ship.
B001EY2RL6|5|They fit perfectly over my glasses and i love them.<br />They are dark enough even for the brightest of days or just a bad headache. Worth every penny.
B000BOAX1G|4|I've purchased to of these blind spot mirror's before and I have to say... I like these quite a bit! They are adjustable (you can swivel 360) and the adhesive on the back seems to be working quite well through a variety of weather situations. Driving my new 2015 Scion TC, I NEEDED to make sure I didn't bang up any of the sides of my cars when I come to a situation where I have to parallel park(I was awful at it)...I would highly recommend this product to anyone leasing a car as well!
B000JZIWT2|5|a good value for this item !
B00HDFANFW|5|This helmet is SWEET! Very comfortable and great breath ability.
B00YHF1VQG|5|worked great
B004HMBK5G|3|Bought this because my girlfriend wont wear her seatbelt right, she wont use it, mostly because it was too bulky, but also because she cant get used to the strap over her collarbone. Better off just using a hair tie or something like that to slide the top strap back. At least its cheap and helped me to figure out what the real issue was. It is a little difficult t get off, once its clipped. and the top strap comes out of the little hook, so I just clipped both straps and folded the top one back over, worked fine for me, but I do have to agree it was a little bulky
B00OTR3RUK|5|Works great! A little bigger than a factory installed one but works like it should.
B009B42G58|5|I have installed a pair of these a month ago in my 2008 Mazda 3 and it fitted perfectly and the suspension is now working smoothly. It still early to judge how many miles they will last.
B007RW333A|5|Works for me
B0055E45XY|1|Junk. broke the first time i used it.
B00D3052MA|5|Purchased for my wifes Jeep Liberty she loves them !
B001PWFPE8|3|Had a difficult time using the nut attach tool, but it works.
B00P9VKJR4|3|It would appear the item has done what it is stated to do.  But further testing and time will be the true answer.
B000CHMLIK|5|Fixed the check engine light
B000WJVG8E|4|just as expected. fast shipping thanks
B00J4PPRTQ|5|Great fit for the Jaguar XK8 and good instructions included for left/right installation and break-in procedure.  I plan to upgrade the rear brakes with the same products.
B000NZZ3SG|2|did not fit
B002QAU8MM|5|This worked great for me - it looks so good!
B000BQW5LK|3|The pickup tube is not as pictured. It was a stiff straight plastic tube that was at least an inch to short. The output tubing was very flimsy and would easily fall out of the differential if you weren't careful. Other than that, it worked good enough to get the job done.
B000QGR6DW|5|Fit like like a glove! No complaints!
B00MVHDOXK|5|They worked great. Right size for the application.
B000KZ0Q7W|5|Was exactly what I was looking for.
B00I8IUA06|1|Does not fit 2015 Sonata. Not even close.
B007TY0H9O|3|Not a perfect fit but got them to work alright.
B0001EXGZG|4|Awesome!
B00RCA4O8U|4|I bought this item for my husband's car and it fits perfectly! Easy to fold up and tuck away too.  Great nylon fabric makes it easy to clean as well.
B00A6PFDAG|4|For the price it is a very decent helmet.  On the plus side, it fits nice and snug, it has a nice shape and color, the shield is fairly thick and sturdy, and it has nice features like a removable breath deflector and chin shield.  On the negative side, it has a noticeable blemish in the shel,l and the vents are kind of flimsy and I don't think will last for long.  I bought it for protection and it seems to provide that.
B00E9ANSGU|5|Large wire, long, works great.
B00BTLEIIY|1|terrible quality and does not fit well on my 2014 tundra
B000P6UO2I|4|It a great tool to find a short or ground circuit in your automobile. I found my ground circuit on my driver seat in less than ten minutes, once I hooked the tester. Great tool. Thanks.
B0002ILK6I|5|Good battery great cranking power.
B000EW0KPY|5|Great ebayer
B000XQ15M8|5|WeatherTech mats are probably the most expensive floor mats on the market, but as the old saying goes, &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;  When WeatherTech makes floor mats for a particular vehicle you can rest assured they will fit your car like a glove (These are not &#34;one size fits all&#34; floor mats.)  These floor mats won't end up buched up under the brake and gas pedals or eventually find there way into the trunk either.  When you put them down to protect your car's carpeting, they will stay right there for the life of the vehicle.  My son has a 10 year old Honda and installed WeatherTech mats when the car was new.  In the past 10 years these mats have never moved an inch and when picked up, the carpeting underneath looks brand new and even smells it too.  My friend just bought a new Jeep and I got these mats for her car.  She spend $35K on the vehicle, so you bet these are the mats that went in it.
B002XLBMZQ|1|It looks beautiful but do not buy if you live anywhere it gets wet.  I put it on my truck at the height I would usually use it.  About 3 months later I needed to adjust it for the first time.  The pins had corroded to the point I couldn't take the hitch off or adjust the height.  After an hour of work pounding the pins out I freed the hitch to inspect it.  There was corrosion all over the entire hitch.  Since then I ground down the hitch and it works OK but continues to corrode.<br />Buy one of higher quality if you live somewhere with weather.
B00EKTJS6E|5|Like them a lot. Ordered for Wife's car as well
B00L40ESW6|3|These are super, super cute! They are great accessories for your car... However, I can't really smell anything and the tablets are almost impossible to replace...
B001KRYIC8|5|Fit car as stated. Works well.
B000SL0R9K|5|Very good quality!! I am very pleased :)
B001F2NM2A|5|Bolted right up no drilling.  Had to use then the next day to get pulled out of the mud.
B00ELASYIA|5|These are beefy cables that come in the kewlest bag.  My battery died once, facing south, in our park, and these cables had plenty of length to connect to our other car to give this battery a jump.  Please respect my authority and consider purchasing these cables for yourself.
B000MXW2EM|5|Works great. Allows me to do my brakes quick and easily.
B000R3SNJU|5|Use it all the time. On obd1 and 2 vehicles. Works great!
B0093PHXD0|5|this  works extremely well as advertised does keep you head cool and keeps you hair back out of the way
B00F8UCSB6|1|Stickers came off wouldn't recommend it to anybody!!!
B008UX68OQ|5|it fits and works fine
B002KCE6LU|5|A must have for quick inflating of tires. Also works great to deflate tires if you unplug it from the power tank.
B00EOX2IRW|5|Worked great under our liter box to protect the wood floor.
B00VFY7N1O|5|Great fit!
B00YML13OU|5|Just as described. I feel safer now teaching my daughter to drive.
B006FXFFMY|5|Exactly what I wanted, fit was fine. Easy to install and looks good. Thanks!
B00VAVPCGK|4|Good
B001THQP84|5|Perfect
B000CFUB6G|5|Perfect
B001TY76PS|5|Seems  to be holding up well
B00KTHYCEO|5|Feels just as sturdy as the original that came with the SUV. It took me a few tries to get the programming right, as there are many steps, but go to the dealership and price these and you will be happy to go through the lengthy steps to program this!<br /><br />I think it was stated in another review, if you are purchasing this as a second remote, you will also have to reprogram the original. No big deal, by then you will be an expert at programming ;)
B00IPC75MQ|5|Remember results will come after 100 or so miles break in so don't cry
B0067UMS98|5|Perfect, exactly what we needed and it arrived right on time!
B0071CSBH4|5|Great fit for a 2014 CX-5. A must have in sunny places. Excellent product !
B000TDT8II|5|Great product at a great price.  Easy to install
B00IV7PPMM|5|So awesome! Love my little smiley alien on my car. It is roughly the size of photo graph if you were to get one printed. Goes on super easy.
B00OO1AU2Y|5|Thanks for the great product. It was exactly what I needed. It fit and worked perfectly. I will definitely recommend you to my friends.
B000A0CALC|5|Very good filter
B008B9FE08|5|I have gotten lots of compliments ( fits 42mm emblem ok )
B001O77CMW|5|Had to drill a few more holes and add two 70mm long m8x1.25, and a bunch of nylon spacers (for a total of 1 1/4&#34; ) to get its universal mounting plate to screw down on top of hondas rear trunk rack.
B00AZ4R9FK|5|Great Service, just what I wanted, price very good, dressed up my car!!!
B001UNLOI8|5|Met my expectations. Very well made.
B00VSB80E8|4|These sun shades are great. They are a bit smaller than I had hoped. If place at the bottom of my back side window it covers about 2/3rds of the window. I placed them in the dead center of the window and there is space on all sides. I love the design of these. The colors are great and hold true. I havent had any fading so far. I am sure over time they will fade just like anything else left in the sun. From the inside looking out you are still able to see everything that you need to so these do not block your line of site.<br /><br />These sun shades come with suction cups that work great. There is even an extra set included thankfully. The first time I rolled my window down I totally forgot I had these on them and popped one of the suctions cuts out of the window before I realized it. This set also comes with a storage bag to store them in when not in use. These fold up to about the size of my hand to be stored. Over all these have worked great for me.<br />I purchased these at a discounted rate in return for my honest unbiased review.
B00902G378|4|The only thing I didn't like is the seat switch did not fit snug like the original. Cant beat the price.
B001ENN1QW|5|First Class material and style.
B00004X145|1|complete rip off. The picture shows the exact oil pan that was sold at AutoZone a couple months ago with the dropped down spout that works perfect for pouring into a container. but what I received is not anything like the picture. It is an oilpan with a spout that is level with the upper rim and so when you pour the used oil, it runs virtually everywhere. I bought 5 of these and I am going to make a functional pour spout with duct tape. Shame too. Autozone doesn't sell the one in the picture anymore and I can't find this type anywhere.
B00ACOB4YA|2|This cover does not keep the car dry.  The rain just goes through.  It is only good for sun protection and to keep dust and debris off the car.
B008ZU823E|4|Great glove all around. Supplies enough air for ventilation, but still keeps ob the warmth on slightly colder rides. The thumb needs to be reinforced, though. I can already tell it's going to be the weak spot ob the stitching.
B004VGAJOG|5|Great fit!
B006B28XJQ|5|Excellent
B004CSEJ76|4|Great price.just have to wait and see if it holds up to the test in everday duties.
B00CBZ3ST2|1|did not fit.
B0075ON740|5|Shipped quickly and worked as advertised so far. Hopefully it holds up better than the stock Razor batteries. Good option to save money.
B00EP3PPEY|5|Great looking steps and sturdy too. Shipped 2 days with prime, great price, direct bolt-on with no drilling, and preferred the chrome and straight bar look. The 4&#34; oval width gives you a wider step over a tube without being so wide that it looks completely aftermarket. Install took 90 min but should have been quicker. There was more hardware than I expected, additional bracing was included. Here's the tips: passenger & driver side hardware in matching color bubble wrap, and each bracket has placement stamped in it (pf, pm, pr - passenger: front middle rear). Next, each bracket goes on a body mount, and an additional brace goes on each front & middle bracket. I didn't use an air gun on the first side like the instructions suggest, but it sure made the second side go quick. Maxmate's other products advertise they use marine grade stainless steel for better corrosion resistance, and I assume this product is too since the description mentions a lifetime warranty. I have great expectations for these and I hope I'm right!
B003FJKY40|1|Ripped off by crf performance part didn't fit /cheaply made set it back they denied receiving in mail no refund &*$*@
B00BITRAXW|5|Perfect fit on a 98 Civic LX. Easy to swap with broken handle using only youtube videos. Delivered in 2 days just as I chose.
B00LUMBNIA|5|Great value, handy to have on my boat.
B00B21R0TA|5|These things are crazy bright and cutoff is awesome. Did the retrofit on my 01 civic and in super easy. i have had them for 3 weeks now and everything looks as good as new. I am forsure buying another set for my next project.
B000CO91IQ|3|Wrong size.
B0083824I2|5|Order Tuesday got them Friday installed them by myself n 20 mins looks great cheap to activate great product...
B00696Y74O|5|I cannot believe this doesn't just come standard in every diesel car trunk, along with the spare tire and first aid kit!!!  after almost getting stranded in the hills of Pennsylvania in the middle of the night because all I could find where Truck diesel sized pumps, I am happy to have found this adaptor.
B00OUGGUTU|5|This easy to install good direction .this Siren Horn works great loud enough to gets peoples attention. Very satisfied with quality of product and the loudness. I have no issues at all im recommending to my friends .Purchase this under promotional item with my own opinion and honest for review
B004940ZNK|5|Works great.  Quick easy install.  15 minutes on and 08 Chevy Malibu if you know what you are doing
B004ZSBMHS|1|Pretty cheap.
B004ME4MKE|5|Works great
B000BUQOGI|4|Good light duty plug.  Would use it full time.  Just seems on the cheaper side.  Great for just in case situations.
B00CCSVU8O|5|Fits my 2010 STI, easily installed
B00QNG7M6A|4|I bought these a year ago from another retailer and installed in 2014 Durango fog lights. They are just a bit brighter then Oem halogen but range is shorter. They appear to be slightly blinking when Ac is on. Not much else to add they ate just average for the price. I will be shopping for brighter set.
B00I1KMNFQ|5|Received in timely manor,Price was great, Is direct replacement for 5year old battery,fit hole perfectly, which is a very tight fit. Honda 300 4 wheeler.
B00KTI0C56|5|i have to go to the dealership to get them programed but i love them they are very nice looking and new
B000H01NFY|5|I've been using this stuff for a few years and while it has been called a waste of money by some, the temperature gauge isn't lying to me. Average temps at idle (during the summer) are 16F lower than before and when the thermostat opens the temp drops by almost twice as much in almost half the time compared to the green stuff.
B00T0WKTCI|1|Horrible. Impossible to do without substandard results.
B00EAREZCI|5|The mud guards fit perfectly on my 2015 Sonic LTZ Hatchback. They were well made and enhanced the appearance of the vehicle as well as deflecting the splash up along the lower edge of the car. Would highly recommend these mud guards.
B00I3T6IZ6|5|Love it, creeps out all my relatives because they think I am a psycho. And cracks my uncle up who enjoys computers and making fun of apple just as much as me XD
B001JDE6ZW|5|Perfect
B005ZUMFHQ|4|This device was given to me as a gift at a festival by someone who'd already owned it for two years. For the next two years it worked perfectly for me - albeit sometimes I had to try to ignite it several times and the red light was pretty faded by year four. It stopped working the last day of a music festival this June. I'd hoped I'd be able to get it to ignite agin once home but no luck. The gas had squirted out a couple to,es before that but I assumed it was because it had been full in travel and the pressure changes of elevation effected it.<br /><br />All in all I'd say it's an amazing vape for travel especially camping sense no electricity is required to keep it going. I didn't use it as my regular piece so idk about overuse but I used it frequently for four to nine days straight several times a year with numerous people without any trouble.<br /><br />My advice<br />Don't travel between elevations with it full<br />Careful letting it get too hot or too cold<br />I found filling it up upside down works best but that makes the butane very cold so wait a moment for it to warm back up before igniting<br /><br />I'm most likely purchasing another one because it's perfect for my use.
B00B0ZMKTS|1|Do not buy, unfortunately.  For about the first 5-10 times using 2 of these straps over the course of a few weeks, I would have rated them 5 stars.  However, they started failing to release, which makes them almost unusable.  They retract just fine, but after ratcheting them tight to hold the load, it is impossible to get them to release -- pressing the red button as hard as you like accomplishes nothing.  (Pressing the red release button is supposed to force metal holding against the ratcheting teeth to release it.  However, it jams and will not release.)  Very frustrating!  If you've got something tightened down, and can't get the straps off . . . well, there you go.  You have to get a screwdriver and pry back the metal piece against the teeth, which is what it is supposed to do on its own.  I'm very disappointed, because I intentionally wanted the orange straps with blue handles.  If you don't have a screwdriver when it comes time to unload, you're beat!   I have 2 other types of retractable ratchet straps, and they both work great.  The most regular applications  use them for are tying things on my trailer -- ATV,, canoes and kayaks, lawn tractor, etc.
B00GHKMKT6|5|Was a genuine part an fit the correct year like was said.
B00U1OA4L0|2|It glows brillant orange nicely....but the skull face fell off after 2 miles on a bumpy trail...tiny screws bond the skull base to the facial structure.....good news is that the led's are nkt mounted in the face....so still tail light.
B001KS6FPK|4|haven't try it yet .But I assume it's good.
B000M3V95U|4|It took several applications to actually remove the grime off of my windshields but once it did, the clarity was pretty good.
B007ND4P0S|3|Works great, bright light looks fantastic next to xenons of my e39.  The wiring is abit flimsy (not as robust as other under-hood wires) and it does &#34;throw&#34; a &#34;check side light&#34; code.<br /><br />Follow up March 2016:  Downgrading to 3 stars after both stopped working after 10 months.  I'm not sure if its these units or another problem, but I'm not optimistic. If they're truly dead (strange that both would go simultaneously) then I'll downgrade the review further.
B001A0N83K|4|Looks like a good quality set of mirror's. Havn't installed yet.
B00V36KSOS|5|OEM.
B004P91FCO|5|Very nice kit.
B003LS15XY|5|Pricey, but you won't regret it.
B007PENKI8|4|I drive to landfills and constantly have tire issues. For the most part, this is a decent chuck and I use it pretty much daily. I've had chucks that lock on better, but if you have perfect threads on your valve stems, this is fine. Mine are not so perfect and about 75% of the time I gotta hold it on. Just wish it locked on more positively. In conclusion, it's worth it. Well made.
B004Y5AUP2|5|Have had these for a few months now on our canopy/truck.  It's worked absolutely great for our two 10' kayaks and for hauling construction material as needed.
B00AWWFRWW|5|Love this Decal...would suggest to have a professional install it though. That is what i did as it is a large decal and you only have one shot! Yes I put it on my Wrangler and yes I know it's not a Firebird...lol. I just like the look...This is the silver decal on black. (see photo) It came with the two small decals as well and I put them on the side just above the Wrangler decal in front of the door.
B0009YDQEE|2|I bought this as a backup set in case my current one gets dirty. When I received these I was very disappointed - all 4 pieces have black statins (looks like motor oil) on one particular edge, almost like someone already used them!!  And all 4 mats were stapled together multiple times, it took me forever to separate them (the staples also leave holes on the surface). Too bad I didn't have the time to return these and buy new ones. I never expected these mats to last long given the price, but at least they should be clean!!!
B0042ZDJY8|5|Good Brush.
B006EGAIII|5|Worked very well. Nice and wide for my truck's large tires.
B002OUMVWY|4|it works like it is supposed to would buy again
B0002SR56W|5|Works great. Used it on a Mack R600 truck for the fuel and oil filters. Looks just like the pic here. Made good.
B00G6RE7ZK|5|Love it!! Great product
B001898YDW|5|Great look and fit, very quiet ride.
B000YOH16I|4|Great item to carry with you if you have a tandem axel trailer.  I have used it to install a new set of tires without jacking up the Airstream.  Worked very well except once on a concrete surface.  Recommended!
B00U2ILR34|5|Works great
B00BMRZN66|4|Great product. This is my second. First lasted three years and saved my back immeasurable pain. Works fast, reliably and without spills. What more can you ask.
B00BAZ3Q64|5|Easy to use and good protection
B007V8XXN0|4|Great pipe. Quality is better than what you'd expect for the price, definitely worth buying.
B0081ZVBDQ|5|key works great make sure you watch the video. how to install,you will have no problem
B001CHG19O|5|wow
B007ZDFF9Q|5|Quality at it's best and made in the USA.
B0047DHKOK|2|After a few weeks, the pink color has faded to gray.  very disappointed
B000FQ05Z4|5|Fit perfectly.
B00651BRP0|4|This works fine on my 2014 GMC Sierra 2500.  Although they do come loose due to vibration or when I take my truck through the car wash.  Radio works fine with this Antenna.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Works Great
B00MB0EXGE|1|Arrived beautiful; after just 1 week on the car the hot pink becomes a pale/yellowy ugly color....
B00BV65DUO|5|Thanks You!!!
B0101U6OVW|5|Trump for president!!!
B00JVHLS3G|1|I ordered a Emblem for a 2005 Z4 went to instal removed the worn one and realized the new replacement did not include the grommets and the pins were in the at 12 and 6  instead of 3 and 10 . after checking the back all the numbers and markings were the same on both Emblems . the effect is the BMW sits on its side its crap
B00ONHDL7A|5|It worked perfectly great. And I put it in myself. Thank you amazon for the your great deals online shopping.
B000B68VEK|4|Easy install
B000MXX44Y|5|Perfect for ATV use.  Easy to read for 3-5 psi.
B007WQQNQA|5|Work very good
B00BJ5W9HW|5|We own a Nissan Leaf and this charging station is in our garage. It works amazingly well.
B00SJTV88M|5|Perfect!!!! Above expectations
B0058J50LC|4|Fit is a little off. The sit higher up than the stock lights. They look great though. No issues with the LED lights yet.
B007X48RV0|5|love them!
B00FZNEYMW|1|only one bolt came in the package
B003CJK7RW|2|wrong one for my bike but i opened it and now its mine
B00OZVA0XC|5|Well there legal in Colorado and I love them gives my jeep a great look
B000UV4V0O|5|Look great and do way more then I thought.
B004D9KY0K|5|Looks to be just as described, have not installed it yet.
B0077K8J3G|4|It does what it says it does. Cleans oil off
B00877TP4K|5|Perfect fix for my 02 tundra. Easy to install, quick shipping and good quality. My old window latches were both broken, and would result in the window opening up as soon as you were to hit a bump or slam the door. This is a great fix!
B00537LD1A|4|Yep they work
B00Y3H3WCY|5|These seem to be as well made as any tie down ring.  The ring itself is made out of 1/2 inch diameter rod, bent (forged) into a 'D' shape, and each ring comes with a weld-on shackle.  The inside dimensions of the 'D' are just a little under 3 inches side, and about the same from the shackle to the outer part of the ring.<br />Stamped (forged) right into the ring is the load rating, MBS (minimum breaking strength) of 12,000#, or six tons.<br />The shackle is made of a grade of steel that welded to my project really well, and seems thick enough to take whatever the ring will hold.<br />I was going to give 4 stars for quality, but the low price compared to what I could find locally (that didn't appear to be made any better) made me add a half a star, and 4 1/2 rounds up to 5
B00FFGPLRG|5|looks majestic on our vehicles
B00062YVSE|5|Perfect for street racing cars. Not expensive, reliable and easy to install
B00381BS3Q|5|All of the Meguiar's product I've brought worked!! No other products will be use from now on. I'm a tested believe. These are very good products!!!
B008FTZQIY|4|As advertised
B00KN2ITS0|5|Wish I could find more.
B00NTC76T4|5|This one was interesting. I bought this for a China made off road buggy (roketa) and after some forums, i found the design of the motor was based off the Honda 250 technology and it worked!!
B00VQTLGMK|4|I like the holder on my 2008 Lexus RX350.  Hated the idea of putting holes in the bumper for a traditional frame.<br />Mounting was super easy and it looks good.<br />My only complaint is that the design makes it easy for the frame to twist around the post/screw.  There is one screw that attaches the frame to the post.  They give you a rubber washer, but this does not keep the frame from twisting.  Usually this is not a problem, but I bent my plate when I went through an automated car was.  So just be careful going through car washes. :)
B005DMBJFA|3|little cheesy looking also too expansive
B00CEXK9TS|5|Adds the right touch<br />nice
B004ZF4MW8|5|Installed on 2012 Mazda CX-9. Be sure to review the install diagram prior to install of course but this couldn't have been easier. It was literally plug and play. Simply remove your halogen bulbs, plug the cooresponding plugs into each other (make sure you have negative and positive connected properly) and thats it. The ballast and other components fit into the low-beam assembly no problem so I didn't have to drill my assembly cap or mount the ballast in the engine bay. You'll need to remove the coolant reservoir on the passenger side to access the low beam assembly; three bolts; simple. The only hiccup I had was the connector from the vehicle to the ballast, it didn't seem to snap into place as easily as it would have been as the reverse red/black for example. Ensure the polarity is correct; I had to add pressure until the connectors snapped into place. It was just odd that it was extremely easy for the connectors to snap into place when the incorrect polarities were lined up.
B003S9IGII|5|plugged right into my lancer...
B00DQD5WMO|4|Paint on Mount a little cheap, but works well
B003ZWG6T4|5|Perfect Fit!
B007Q1WJT6|5|Lightweight, shatterproof, keeps wind/ debris out of your eyes and look good on and off the bike.
B001EP0G72|4|Like everyone says, don't go by the wire markings in the connector. Go online and get the right diagram. Good piece and easy to use.
B0013TM0Z0|1|Doesn't heat very well.
B00U1W6FK6|5|Met my expectations, price was lower than many auto parts sites. Well pleased.
B00GEV9780|5|cool mask love the fact that it glows in the dark its so cool to look at thanks guys
B00D6N0U76|5|Great product arrived in about 3 days
B0054RG2E2|5|Bought this to go with stainless braided brake lines, got the brace installed... I am very pleased with how it helps! When you are braking with this installed the pedal drops less and feels a lot more firm under hard braking. Haven't got the lines in, but I already love how this made my brakes feel.
B008S8YIMC|4|I received it quickly and it fit perfectly.
B00MJ44SKS|5|Great item, shipped fast and quality product.
B000GV7DDK|5|Arrived in perfect condition, well boxed and packaged. Easily installed and looks great.
B00B1XG3LU|5|very easy to install
B00M9ITQT2|4|Took a while to fit correctly but it looks great
B00MVMRS6O|5|I bought the set of 12 lights to mount under my jeep for rock lights. I needed these to light in front of and behind each tire for off-roading at night so I can see obstacles up close.<br />The high end competitor charges 10x the price for rock lights so I figured for 20 bucks is give these a try.<br />The lights themselves seemed very well sealed. The wires are very thin coming out of the light but the are very low watt lights so that should work.<br />Install was very straight forward. Drill a hole and stick light through like sticking a bolt through. I made some aluminum brackets for some of the bulbs to get the angle right<br />When I turned them all on I was blown away by how much light they put out.<br />Have driven in the rain with them and no water entry into the bulb which is great.<br />Very pleased so far.<br />I will update if there are any failures.
B000GS2T9Q|5|Had burly slammers standard duty, my big 250lbs arse bottomed those out. Destroyed 1&#34; off my wire harness under my fender. Got 11&#34; heavy dutys and put them at pre set 5. Haven't bottomed out, rode yesterday 2 up for a hundred or so miles with no rub or bottoming out. we'll see in time. If i edit this they've broken or suck. Some say the ride is rough, I say not really. Kind of like a caddilac compared to the slammers, but not stock either. They handle the twists pretty well.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!! I've put 10k on them, after they broke in they became a little more comfortable, but the bIke being lowered still rides over bumps lIke a dropped civic. My big arse still hasn't bottomed these out.
B002NUABUO|4|works good
B002KCWWFC|5|Works very well. Quick delivery.
B001651RHI|4|Excellent hitch for my Toyota RAV4, just remember to clean the bolt holes on the car and spray with lub makes life easier.<br />Only issue I've had is the hitch less then a year old showed signs of rust spots. I would recommend before you mount it spraying it with a black rust preventing paint.
B0002NYDZ8|5|Works very well. Quick delivery
B00COYNZJ8|5|Looks really cool! Covers whole windshield!! Great product!!
B00ONHDG0W|4|The lights shipped on a timely basis. Although one of the blinking light did not work. The lights fit perfectly.
B0036UI1OI|5|So far it is a great chair.
B00KA65E8C|5|Great, fast service!
B002LYQALQ|5|Great product, works perfectly for the intended job in keeping the oil exactly where I need it and not all over the place.
B00CD2RCFO|5|These are a great addition to the truck.  Looks like factory fit but wider and taller. Easy to install and seems pretty sturdy. The only issue now is trying to find mud flaps that will fit the new flares.
B00HV0RXI4|1|Terrible construction. Seat covers came in pieces and didn't fit correctly.
B000IPAK9S|5|Good heavy duty cord.
B00FRHOGU6|5|works good
B00BKWTGHK|5|Great so far. Will see how long it last. Very easy to install.
B00OA66IAG|1|Brush broke on first day of use. Very cheaply glued to handle!
B00SBZRR8O|2|The auto shut off does not work!!  Had the opportunity to return, but decided to keep.
B000TFTI3G|5|Snappy, bright, a good bobber headlight. No room for a rat's nest inside the bucket -- you'll have to move that nightmare somewhere else.
B00191X8DU|5|GREAT hard-to-find coral color. Sprayed on evenly and smoothly.
B00ARUSTT2|1|It was totally the wrong part. If i knew I needed a part number, I would have gotten one. It did not fit my car at all and cost me more out of pocket then what it was worth.
B001TJZ6IC|2|Doesn't fit the seat that good.Waste of money!
B005RNGN8I|5|works as advertized
B00DI3DV6G|4|My trunk is always messy and it helped me organized better, it's light but durable it's medium size it's not big but works great
B002XLHUQG|1|This is a hard rating because it was not boldly evident that these ONLY fit 10 inch separations between tires rendering them useless to me since I have 15&#34;. I purchased these based on the praises of many RVers I have met over the year. Unfortunately, by the time I tried them on my RV(travel trailer), after having warranty work done, it was past the time (by 3 days) I could return. So now I have a pair of brand new X-chocks that are worthless to me - wish Amazon would take them back so I could buy the ones I need. Can't comment on whether they work as well as I've been told. Just make sure you read the fine print to ensure a good fit.
B00WTEBTB4|5|I was looking for a bracket to hold my iPhone or GPS device onto my Victory CC Tour.  The handlebars run front to back where I wanted to mount the device.  This was the only mount that I could find that can be adjusted in almost ANY direction.  Its well built and fully adjustable!  I'm writing this review after using it for a few weeks to give it an honest review..... I'm picky as to how things look on my bike and this didn't disappoint me!  I purchased a RAM mount for my iPhone and my Garmin GPS.... they bolt right up to this perfectly.  Sturdy Too!
B000XRHRZQ|5|Looks and fit great. Looks like the original and a whole lot cheaper. I also purchased the Toyota symbol sticker for the center and you can't tell it is not an original hubcap.
B000CAYT3M|1|This belt DOES NOT foot the 2.3 motor 6PK1320 is the correct belt. So back it goes. Not happy with your parts finder!.
B00QYBJ992|5|Rode over 4000 miles the first trip i took using this pad and it made a huge difference in my comfort level. My hips and butt werent aching near as much as they used to without it.
B00GJZ1BH6|5|very nice helmet
B0000AY4MK|5|Great product, works good for me
B0075AKEUY|3|One of the snaps & clips fell off the first time I put it on my bike, However it still worked with only one.
B00B4KTH90|5|Perfect fit for 2006 Silverado.  Electrical connector had a pigtail instead of plugging directly to motor like OEM one but OE connector plugged into pigtail and window work smoothly.
B00VXNK490|4|Nice Polarized Visor, just wish it were a  &#34;wider 5 inches&#34; over existing  3.5 inches -- would have made it the perfect size for me.
B007IIR9M4|5|Absolutely perfect windshield wipers for my FJ! Shipped fast and super easy installation.
B004HIQ9X8|4|Great bike carrier, just remember to buy a hitch lock.
B0012RI71Y|4|Nice to get everything you need in one kit. Recommended.
B004MB8ZBY|5|This puller worked great, they should maybe chamfer the end a little more as there was some gaulding on the end of the threads from where it contacted the crankshaft while pushing out the flywheel. The puller did not want to unthread through the coil because of this. This was taken care of with a little thread clean up and a file smoothing/chamfering off the end. By feathering an electric impact (Sorry, it was laughing at the hammer tap method), it popped off a flywheel that has been on the bike for 27 years. I give it a thumbs up.
B00RUE3I1W|4|Nice
B003V88IL6|5|Great set of bars I installed them on a 09 Yamaha Vstar 1300 Touring and they made the bike so much more comfortable to ride!
B00BITILOY|1|just went to put item on my Toyota Tundra and it does not fit. I see the description has been updated to say Does not fit Toyota Tundra. Too bad I waited too long to try to put it on as it is now past the exchange time window.
B001B7C0IG|5|Great seller and customer service.  Part fit as described and works great.
B00WH681V0|5|Lights up the night like daytime.
B008DIULYG|5|Excellent part, new rubber is firm, this is much better than the polyurethane aftermarket rear bushings.
B000XTPO2M|3|The cloths can rip easily, But the chain is decent, I would not leave my bike out for more than a day, But, i go to the store and run miles. When i come back my bike is there.
B00LK87LNU|5|I wish these were bigger, but they are enough to get the message across.
B004I19B3O|5|Exactly as described, high quality, easy to install, 100% fits Chrysler Pacifica 2004, Thanks!
B0048IZX6Q|5|Perfect fit.  Easy to install and works great.  Motor operates fast, quiet and smoothly.  After cutting the four rivets holding in the old motors, I installed this using grade-8 bolts with fender washers, lock washers and nuts.
B0048F3MVW|4|Quality was good. Color was good.workmanshipwas fair.
B00A6AS6LY|5|works great
B00BYH6C1E|5|I have lost nothing...between my seats...in my car! supper awesome idea and implementation...Kinda wish they were a little longer though.
B00WVJQ0AW|5|Wow!  Arrived much sooner than expected.  Discovered I had to use one of the provided adapters for reverse polarity for my Triumph.  The OEM baffle had to be modified to allow the additional cables to move to the outside as Triumph doesn't leave a lot of room.  I drilled and filed at the bottom to allow for just enough space to insert one end of the adapter ends and moved everything else under the fairing.  It is all very compact and easy to find room for.  I'm guessing the hole will also help air circulate to keep the back of the light cool.  I had ordered the H11, which replaces both H9 and H8 bulbs too.  It looks really good and much brighter than the H9 stock bulb that was in place for my &#34;bright&#34; lights and it goes well with my H7 HID light I use for my &#34;dipped&#34; light.  Now I'm wondering if I should get more of these lights to run in our other vehicles too!
B00I548PZA|5|Excellent product perfect fit
B009KYYUJE|5|Quick shipping, got the tire fixed
B00NVTZ0ZC|4|The build quality of this light is amazing. I'm comparing it to a Rigid 4&#34; light that a buddy just purchased for 4 times as much as this 22&#34;. From the packaging to the harness to the mounting hardware; it's all top notch. The light performance is good for an LED. How ever the light lacks a bit of throw. It's extremely bright right infront of my truck. Almost to the point of being too bright but leaves a bit to be desired beyond 25 yards (minus one star). Very simple installation with the supplied harness.
B00PKGYZ1O|1|Not loud  enough unless you doing 30.  Look very cheap. Made my bike look like somthing  from Mexico.  Sent it back
B007TYEYFC|1|It was the wrong mirror.  Even though it was advertised as the one for my vehicle.
B00HJ1UY18|5|It came back right on time.thank you so much.
B00K5BDQF0|5|Buy it, put it in, love it!
B0053ZKM1Y|4|As advertised I am French so It was great for me!
B006R170LI|4|These really light up my truck. Very bright white light. Used in dome light and cargo light.
B000GV0P76|3|Ordered it to degree my cam and it did not have the degree wheel. Was corrected quickly. None the less postponed the engine build. I was floored that it didn't have the wheel.
B009060X0M|5|Easy to install and work very well.
B004C6W3MG|5|Worked great! A little work to install, but this made it as easy as possible for the car that it is made for.
B00GIBEZU6|5|This one fixed my pickup.
B00PH99P3C|5|Excellent Fit and Finish for my 1999 Mercury Grand Marquis. Exact Part # and Brand was $88 more at O'reillys and Autozone. And neither Brick and Mortar store had the item in stock. My order arrived within 2 days in the A.M. All Bolts, washers etc were included. Installation took 2 1/2 Hours and it is the first Manifold I've ever done. No Runs, No Drips No errors! Old girl has more torque/throttle response and at least 1 mpg improvement highway.
B00Q3UOGI8|3|Bought these for a 2015 Honda Grom. The packaging was beat to hell. And there was some cosmetic damage on the paint finish of the mirrors and hardware. But they do fit nice on the factory bar insert saving from needing to drill the insert out of the bars.
B00GI9NP0O|5|Genuine Honda replacement part at very reasonable price....below dealer cost.
B00OTYPNRI|5|First touch up paint that works as advertised. It arrived promptly and in excellent condition. The design of the applicator should keep the paint flowing for a long time; color match is perfect and the clearcoat makes the repair disappear.  Expensive but worth it. Highly recommended.
B00Y2CJ5CQ|5|Good deal
B0036E9VB6|5|Workers beautifully does get a little hot but filled my flat 18&quot; tire quickly and the cord reaches every tire as well.  Definite buy again
B00KH09NJC|5|I've been using this for years on my cars.  It is very easy to use--you pretty much just add it to your oil and fuel filler and go on a long drive to activate it.  I first used it many years ago on a 1986 RX-7 Sport.  The engine ran much cooler and my gas mileage increased by almost 10%, plus the car felt much peppier, and the oil consumption in the Rotary engine was reduced.  You only have to add it once (unlike the cheap knockoffs).  At the time, a Rx7 magazine (called Rotary Rocket, if I recall correctly) tested it and sent the engine parts to NASA (yeah, I know, but bear with me) to be analyzed and after looking at the metal under an electron microscope, pits in the metal had been filled in and smoothed by the product.  I was quite skeptical at the time but after application, the manufacturers claims of better gas mileage, etc., did come true.<br /><br />I've used it on almost all of my cars since and have never had any problems with it.  I did not notice as much as a difference with modern cars--I suspect that computers in modern cars somehow mask the effects of the product a bit.  I also have not used the CL100 mix (the better mix) on newer cars but plan to on my next new car in a few months.<br /><br />I originally thought this stuff was &#34;snake oil&#34; but it really does seem to work.
B00MNQJC94|5|Great price. Fit perfectly.
B007FMJGW4|5|Fits perfectly in my Ford Flex!!!
B00WN3QFWO|4|it gotta great looking on my car but kinda too small.. but still thanks
B001DKPMAO|3|Looks OK from a distance.  Sort of cheaply made.  I'm afraid when winter comes it will break from the cold.
B0091OE6K6|1|These holders are worthless.  They do not stay in place and when you try to use them -- they open up.  If you are looking for a solution to the seat belt cutting into your neck, get something to go over the seat belt.  I got a couple at WalMart for less than $3 and they slide up and down the belt for quick adjustment.  Also another thing to keep in mind -- when using these clips, does it create a safety issue because you change where the belt falls? -- I can see them breaking away in an accident because they don't stay fastened while just driving without an accident.  I don't know -- I just got tired of the seat belt having to be readjusted all the time and even holding it away from me because of the frustration of it being annoying.  Not anymore just search walmart.com for Auto Drive Seatbelt Shoulder Pad, they are like $3 each.  You will be so glad you did.
B00U868BN4|1|Drove 250 miles with this plugged in and not even a hint of ozone.Therefore I don't believe it is doing anything other than<br />lighting up a blue light.
B0011NMM2Y|5|Right fit, good price
B002CNAEHM|5|Update, April 2016: still going strong! :-)<br /><br />Update, October 2015: so far so good ;)<br /><br />--<br /><br />Bought for 2008 Toyota Yaris sedan right-hand-drive (after one of my hubcaps was stolen). Purchased in July 2015.<br />These arrived in good condition, no cracks or broken clips.<br /><br />Installation was easy after I watched two videos online, as these came with no instructions. At least not in my package.<br /><br />They're a bit 'bright' compared to the original Toyota hubcaps... a slightly brighter silver-grey. Just to be safe, I did put tie straps on each cap because I don't want to end up writing about them flying off while driving. lol. They did seem to go on snugly, but I don't trust them as I did the originals.<br /><br />I'll update this review should anything significant happen.
B00S6OIR6G|5|Perfect! Beautiful!
B00HNXCEM4|5|Great item does not work on 2016 Mazda Miata it is to short
B00BDVM8P0|5|This past year I have purchased 2 Toyotas for my kids. Both had broken antennas. This is the best price & so easy to replace. Took less then an hour to replace a 4 runner & Lexus RX.
B0009TAOBC|4|Looks good, and easy install!
B00133NYXS|5|Good combination with pacesetter long tubes. Adds power throughout the rpm band when paired with the pacesetter lt's. Good quality exhaust pipe. Would recommend this product.
B000C39C7M|5|A nice addition for a variety of vehicles to keep your tranny temps lower! A normal drop of 15-30 degrees depending on your driving and the outside temperatures. The only thing is that I wish there was a better bracket system to bolt it down. Had to essentially configure something myself.  Would definitely buy again.
B000GU7TEY|5|the wires are good look
B0001EX1X8|5|Great fit,easy to install
B00AKT4NMW|3|Excellent product.  Not what I was looking for, but that is my fault not its.  I put it in my kitchen for scraps instead of in the car.  I would certainly buy this again.
B00032KC3K|1|One one of 4 stay on after first ride. Trash product.
B00MNT8CKQ|2|This is 2nd cover we have ordered both have been the wrong size. Very difficult to order the correct size
B00062ZLVA|5|Fit as expected. No complaints.  No performance gains that i can notice, but I at least have a lifetime filter.
B000IYU8PK|5|Worked great in my Geo Metro.  Very happy with the quality of this product.
B0000AXU02|5|Works as expected
B00KCYSZYC|5|My husband is big into recycling and educating others about it.  This sticker is on his car to point out to those behind him that it is a small planet - we live in a small community - and it is up to us to do something about it!
B00HVHNIKY|5|Fits well and saves my remote.
B004MDEVBU|5|Fit as expected, great quality and shipped fast!
B000WJBGOI|1|As stated above, only the lever. This also did not fit the '06 ttr as advertised
B00KTHZJ1O|5|Worked like a charm
B00N3N1HIK|5|Could use longer wire after switch but Very Bright, even through window tint.
B007KCZG6E|5|worked great
B000GU3KHE|3|Extremely thin cover. Material reminds you of that unlined sweat suit material. But I suppose  it'll do the job. Great for traveling. Wouldn't recommend it to cover your motorcycle all year long.
B00GYFKIAW|3|One of the straps ripped upon install. Other than that cool covers.
B00HNW8MJ4|5|Wonderful product soft to the touch and has no smell and color Black Dark
B00O97SHPA|5|Couple of thing one Needs to realise before you buy this produce. Once installed,they place an Iron grip on your engine/trans. No movement what so ever... they transmitter all engine vibration to the car chassis. . Next, the factory bolts with Not be long enough for one bolt in the trans side mount. The center Rear mount All three bolts must be replaced with longer bolts..<br /> Other wise this is a Damn Good Mount kit..
B002M2KO4G|5|Great price excellent quality.
B000X9EGFS|5|100 percent duty cycle is great. Used in a Search and Rescue environment where reliability is critical.
B00ACUELEY|5|Great - thanks..
B000QA0SKQ|5|Very satisfied!
B009IF1IKY|1|Faulty part, cable got caught in the track and didn't work right, sending it back
B001DCC1AQ|1|Part defaulted within 2 days. Junk.
B003NUGL9S|5|The best around for plastic! However follow the directions and use in a very well ventilated area! It's harsh!
B00LNE2EH4|5|great price and exact replacement
B00G9WA1ZC|5|Nelson-Rigg products have always served me well over the years. Their motorcycle covers last forever!<br />I did a lot of research looking for a bag with this capacity and quality. It is very well designed and reasonably priced.<br />The tie down straps with hooks are not usable for my particular needs as they just attach to the bag D-rings which will probably rip  off if tightened too much but will work OK for most commuters and occasional use.<br /> I mounted it to the Touratech  rack on my BMW F650 Twin GS with ROK straps . They completely encircle the bag and once cinched down are very secure and worry free. This bag will also hold a full face helmet!<br />It looks to be carry on size which is a plus if travelling.<br />Overall, it is very versatile and I am quite pleased with it.
B00120OKIA|5|To not bury the lead, we drove 8800 miles across the country in five weeks with the cargo box full of camping gear. There was not a single drop of water in it and we never noticed any noise.<br /><br />Now this is our first cargo box and we did a lot of research. We have a 2001 Hyundai Santa Fe which has a weak roof, so many of the more popular boxes were too heavy. There are smaller and lighter ones from the two big companies, but they are more cheaply made, cost just as much and had a fair number of negative reviews. This had better construction and was about as big as we could put on the car, so we decided to take a chance.<br /><br />I installed it myself (other than an extra set of hands for two minutes to hold the mounting brackets) relatively quickly. It certainly helps that the box is light. The rubber strips that the box and many others use work fine, but there was still a small gap where I cut them so I just covered it with waterproof guerrilla tape. I was pleasantly surprised that with the roof box attached the Santa Fe could still (just barely) fit under the garage door opening, which made it much easier to load and drive around.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely happy with the box. I wish we could have gotten a bigger one, but it was the biggest that would fit our car and it held enough to make a big difference packing. We fit four big sleeping bags and four self-inflating mattresses (including two 3.5&#34; ones). They were always wrapped in contractor bags, but no water ever got in (there were small dead bugs). The box is super light and well made.
B004O24PK6|5|Great
B0014COKYU|5|works great on stained clothes
B00ANXSWQS|4|So far so good, looks nice.
B000C36BOE|5|fits and works fine
B0024E6ZW2|2|This makes the step tilt left or right.  Only if you step exactly in the center, does it work well.  The solution is probably use two.
B00SOH7VCQ|5|Cool!!!!!!
B003IS3HV0|5|I recently purchased the &#34;S-ZONE Men's Crazy-Horse Leather Business Briefcase Shoulder Laptop Bag (Over-sized)&#34; and wanted to ensure the leather was well protected before using it.  I received the Leather Honey with my bag purchase, and they arrived quickly to Okinawa, Japan.  As recommended, I tested the Leather Honey in a conspicuous area to ensure it wouldn't adversely react with something in the leather (i.e. some type of chemical treatment or sealant).  The leather wasn't treated, and the Leather Honey didn't react; therefore, I started to treat the entire bag.  The Leather Honey didn't smell bad, its viscosity was perfect (at room temperature) during the application, and it fully cured within 24 hours (as stated).  I like the product, and would purchase again.  NOTE:  The application of the Leather Honey will considerably darken the leather at first; however, it gradually starts to lighten as it absorbs.
B0014Z3P84|4|Work well.... a little over priced for the quality you get.
B003TU662Y|1|bristles on it suck.
B00A8XHG2Y|4|There is only so much you can say about a trailer hitch. It fit great on my 2014 Chevy Express, although I did have to get out my unibit and drill to get some of the holes to line up.  The coating looks like a pretty good quality corrosion protection and it made it to my house without any damage.  I have experienced difficulty with other trailer hitches not being packaged well, and getting damaged in shipment.<br /><br />It is a sturdy construction and I look forward to hauling some heavy loads with it.
B005UO70ZO|5|My truck runs like new.  Use to be when my truck was cold it didn't even want to shift but since I added archoil it shifts and burns or like no body's business
B00KQPEX4S|2|We feel pretty confident this antenna upgrade will allow us to watch a little TV while camping. We upgraded the Winegard Sensar antenna which came with our RV to the Winegard Razar Air using the upgrade kit.  Installation was fast and easy. Having a coax crimp tool helps. To understand why we gave this antenna such a good review, we live about 50 plus miles south of a major metropolitan area. We use an outdoor antenna on a thirty foot mast at home and get 42 channels when we added the highest powered booster from Radio Shack. The Rayzar Air boosted our choice from 0 channels to 22 while sitting in our driveway.  Revised Review  Winegard should invest as some engineering talent fixing the turning crank which  lifts this antenna. The reception for the antenna is pretty good, but on our second camping trip we cranked the handle to lift the antenna into place, the darn thing fell apart. Winegard used a cheap plastic handle with a tiny set screw to hold the handle in place. It fell off with minimal use.  We are reducing the 5 star rating to 2 star. A replacement will cost around $10.00 EACH TIME IT BREAKS!!!  [[ASIN:B0009JRVWC Winegard (RP-6795) White Elevating Crank]]
B00KV8MS6U|5|Purchased these for my son's Honda Civic. We had never attempted to install any of these lights, so I wasn't sure how it was going to go. But they were fairly simple to install, a little tricky securing the transformers (we used cable ties). Very pleased once we tried them out. Nice clear, bright light.
B000COX484|5|Great price on this product and they installed perfectly and I am getting great gas mileage as a result.
B008IEFA0U|5|Better quality then the price suggests
B000C2S648|5|Replaced the old water pump on my 79 Ford F250 like a charm.
B00HQYTUYA|5|Perfect for the seat belts in our RZR.
B0043AV4NK|5|I thought it was going to be obnoxious sounding. It's not. I even got compliments on how good the car sounds!  I used to always crank the stereo. Now,  I turn it down, sometimes to hear the engine purr!
B0055O6SAC|5|I love this product! Gives my Fit a nice sporty look to it. I had to take it to the dealer for installation because no way I was doing it on my own. Definitely worth it. Looks great
B00RYPYNVG|5|This is a pretty good set of tire spoons.  I use them on my 2003 Suzuki V-strom.  They worked perfectly without bending.  I put considerable force on them a couple of times.  They did flex some, but they never did bend.  I do wish though that they came with one more rim protector.  Great deal for the price though.
B00VNBDWPK|5|This is a short review after two full days of having them. I will update after about a month.<br />The vehicle is a 2008 Chevy Silverado, which has H11 low beams.<br /><br />I've run HID's in this truck before, but felt they were too bright and out of focus, even high quality units from a trusted vendor.<br /><br />Most of the time ive had this truck, i've used 65 watt H9 bulbs instead. While they put out significantly more light then stock, they also burn out in half the time, and one of them caused some melting on the OEM plug.<br /><br />I thought LED's would work better, and bought these based on price and reviews.<br /><br />I specifically searched for &#34;silverado&#34; in my review to find other people with the same model to see their reviews, and they were all 4 and 5 star.<br /><br />Shipping took 3 days from california to rural colorado.<br /><br />Installation took 15 minutes, and that included cutting out the melted connecter on the truck and putting one that i got from the parts store on.<br /><br />They included both capacitors and polarity reverse harnesses in the box, but this truck did not require either.<br /><br />Beam pattern is comparable to the halogen bulb. No out of beam glare noted.<br />Brightness is on par with the 65 watt high beams i had in there.<br />Color is a cool white, vs the warm white from the halogens.<br /><br />I've put at least 100 miles in the dark with them on. Aside from the fact that I probably need to adjust the aim on the headlights a bit, they meet or exceeded my expectations thus far.<br /><br />The fan is noisy. I only noticed this because my headlights stay on for 90 seconds after the engine is off... otherwise, i wouldnt have noticed.<br /><br />As you can see from the attached picture, the output and color is nearly the same as the overwattage halogen. (Drivers side LED, Pass side 65 watt halogen)<br /><br />Second picture shows just the LED.
B00PQ7Z0BQ|5|Works great!
B002SJBXLQ|4|Good shocks, there a little stiff but are excellent off-road and at highway speeds.

B004RCRS9I|5|The only way to make this brush any better is to bring the front of brush with 2inch more of brissles  , so far the very best of all brushes I have used to wash  houses with in 45 years of washing .  Gary B.
B00RNIWFY6|3|good quality but hard to line up properly
B003DFIW1S|3|works great with the maxi fuses the leads are a little smaller than #6 maybe #8 .
B007HBKRJY|5|Very nice hitch. Easy install
B00BA7CBWW|5|Perfect replacement for my broken ones. Just need to reuse or buy new nuts and washers for them.
B000IYXUB4|1|The part is clearly cheaply made. There is a screw that holds one of the heater core hoses in place and the place it screws into actually split open when I was tightening the screw, before the screw was even against the tensioner itself! Now I have a screw halfways tightened, so my heater core hose will probably come loose over time. I took my ratchet and hit it against the tensioner with mild force just to see what it would do and it left dents all over it. The original couldn't be dented with such a light hit, or even a much harder hit. Nowhere near the quality of the original, I'd find a better one. I'm sure I'll be replacing this in no time.
B005VU4C0S|1|We never got the screws or the mounting plates. Chips in paint on steps.
B00EECL90U|5|Order came in very fast as promised ( prime);  fits perfectly in my Challenger... Excellent price!
B008POK1ZM|1|Looked good when they worked...stopped working after 2 months. Had professional install. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
B000JZTN7M|5|great stuff
B00FIO5SBO|5|Bought this for my 03 Rubi. I have flush mount rear leds. My original flasher would hyper flash in hazards. Now all good!!! Also great customer service. I had an issue with the 1st flasher. Called and spoke to Mark. Mark took care of me fast and easy!!!! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!
B000E5S3BY|5|So far so good
B004QHI6RW|5|Delivery on time, part was a perfect fit and the job was not hard to do (DIY) with the proper tools. Instead of paying a Dealer to do, do this yourself and you can get the guidance needed by searching the web.
B003H418A2|3|Clip is so stiff I had to remove it to use the hook.
B00Q5JRD00|5|works great
B00HVQ9BJ2|5|Totally cool, very well made sticker
B002303LU6|5|Fast shipping, just as described. High quality item - very pleased!
B00IAHW7JW|5|I was introduced to these products at a Mercedes-Benz Club event, and I have been using them ever since.  I kinda feel for the guys who used to wash my car twice a month - I still bring it in to them every six weeks or so for them to clean the wheels, the canvas convertible top, and to vacuum the carpets - but for regular maintenance, I just spend 30-45 minutes every week or so with these products to keep it looking clean and new with occasional dusting in between.  The carrying bag helps keep my trunk organized, and the microfiber towels are a must for using these products correctly.  Just toss them in the wash with your regular towels - but don't use fabric softener!
B00YG2PM6K|5|Great filter
B009T53BQ2|5|Perfect fit great price
B004VTJE3A|5|EXCELLENT!
B000QUZ572|4|2006 Dodge Ram 2500 fit perfectly.
B009II5HOY|4|Good battery, accepts and holds a charge. Wish it had 1/4&#34; terminals.
B004GCBE1C|5|I bought this for my 2000 honda civic ex and it camed packaged very good no scratches no anything just a clean bumper, if your thinking of doing the yellow fog light i would do them while the bumper is off makes it esier
B0016LE80K|5|This is perfect to be able to use my TomTom GPS and the charger for my iPhone at the same time.
B009HHHQMC|1|I got a piece of leather.  There are no instructions; it does not &#34;slip right on&#34; WTH?  I guess I will look for an upholstery shop to install my piece of leather. lol

B00IVQ473G|4|Decent quality.  Could have come with better directions.  Works great so far though.
B000A0CANA|5|Good price. Does the job for my 2008 Corolla.
B002YCFQBU|5|The original hose cracked, bought this and worked great!
B00KZCALVQ|5|Great product!!  I have a 2008 Jeep Wrangler, the only downfall is it whistles really bad.  I went to my local hardware store and bought a pack of weather stripping for $4 and placed it in between every other fun and fixed the whistle!! It's an awesome led bar, very bright and effective!!
B001GF7L8C|1|Did not fit 2015 Tundra. Sent back and was quickly refunded. Did not check if this was a error. I ordered the WeatherTech one and it fits like a glove.
B005MZXCSU|5|Replaced an identical ribbon that I had for years.  Very pleased.
B000E7YP7I|5|Does not skid and stay in place. Like it a lot!
B000CAINEI|5|Definitely helps keep the interior of the car a bit cooler.  I have a severe heat intolerance (I wear ice vests away from home), but have to go to MD appointments at times, and this gizmo helps keep me from getting too overheated before I can get the AC cranked up.  Elastic bands at each end keep it from being an unruly mess once it's back in the front floorboard awaiting its next deployment.  Worth the money.
B000CMFKW4|4|I bought it to complete a set.
B008X035N8|1|Amazon said they fit my vehicle and of coarse it does not fit!  Unable to return the product either total waste of money

B006PAGJXQ|1|used 4 times and quit working!!!!!!  would not recommend!!!!!!!!!
B00KAN52ZU|5|Got her faster than I thought and was exactly like the picture and what i expected!
B00EE5F83Q|4|Great product but here are the reasons I gave it a 4 star:<br />1. Size was a little bit off than what was stated online. I am having to return them and purchase one size bigger. I ordered a 4 for my super tiny 4 year old and the waist fit good but the length was too short.<br />2. I guess I assumed that riding pants would come with padding inside the pants, but that's not the case. The only &#34;padded&#34; areas are the knees. The pants provide no additional padding in the hips (which I'm guessing is because these pants are for kids who may not be doing such extreme tricks). I would have liked the padded hips. I re-read the description and it doesn't say anything about including padding in the hips, so I guess that's my bad. But don't purchase this expecting protection other than preventing scrapes/road rash.<br /><br />Positives about this product:<br />1. The waist has an adjustable waist, just like you can buy in jeans for little kids who are skinny but tall. I really appreciated this.<br />2. They only post one image on Amazon, but if you could see the back of the pants, you would LOVE it. The butt area is covered with black, white, and pink cheetah print. Definitely not cheesy, very stylish!<br />3. Very well made.
B00J6C380C|5|I used a friend's lift to raise the entire car then wait 30 minutes for the exhaust to cool, then install the CAGS skip-shift eliminator. Works like a harm!!
B00T7GYDTC|5|[[VIDEOID:c21e80623a924419ad8b4c55627a2bdc]] This is a review for the Auxbeam 12inch LED off road light bar, the item was provided by Auxbeam for testing.<br /><br /> First impressions of this product are good. Coming in at 3 pounds, 9 ozs, this light bar is not a light cheaply made piece of gear. It was surprising to see a light priced so competitively to be so well made. This is one tough and durable light. It has a solid feel and build with well machined parts and hardware. The light feels tough and the included hardware that comes with it provides everything needed to get this mounted and operating in no time.<br />While there were no included instructions, the installation was very simple and straight forward. The pig tail consists of a positive and a negative.  If you already have Auxiliary lights that your wanting to compliment with this light, simply wire it into your existing positive and negative Auxiliary harness and you ready to go.<br />When it came to performance, this is the little light that could! Despite being Auxbeam's compact version of their larger light bars, this light put out an impressive amount light that turned the surrounding area into day. In this particular test, it was tested in the mountains of Northern Arizona where light sources at night are a rare find. This light lit up the dark country side in front of the test vehicle with ease. Being an LED light, it also draw less power from the vehicle then your standard off road lights.<br />Overall, this is an excellent performing product that brings a quality you would expect from a product twice its price.<br />Pros:<br />* Compact and solid build<br />* Easy to install<br />* Great performance for the price<br />* Low power draw<br />Cons:<br />* No installation instructions included<br />* No included wire harness<br />Conclusion,<br />Overall this is a great product for the price that so far as proven to be of solid build and quality, easily keeping up with large brand names in the world of off-road lighting. While not having included instructions or a wire harness is not a deal killer by any stretch, this is a simple addition that Auxbeam could provide for little cost that would improve customer satisfaction. If you need an affordable LED auxiliary light, give this product a try.ons or a wire harness is not a deal killer by any stretch, this is a simple addition that Auxbeam could provide for little cost that would improve customer satisfaction.

B00HLK77YO|1|Let's start with a positive....very easy installation! However, the product lock broken in two days of opening and closing tailgate. The culprit (after taking my whole tail gate apart because I couldn't get unlocked and open) was the latch inside the handle would slip underneath and not catch in order to open the gate. Everyone I have talked to about this lock has told me they break....every time! So, I chose to put old OEM handle back on until TOYOTA makes an OEM one or another company steps up and designs one that actually works
B007J461ZS|5|Direct replacement..

B00TEFMKE6|5|I bought this for my sons car it worked as describe it took less than five minutes to program three remotes.
B007OX6E3S|5|Makes filling presta valves with an air compressor easy as pie. Lubing the orings once in a while will keep them from tearing.
B001G8AIMU|4|clips to small
B001UGPEFY|1|Poor quality. Hope it lasts. Actually taking old one along in case the head snaps off. Next time I will spend the extra 5.00
B003175VJO|5|Worked exactly as described.
B000BZ584M|5|Work's great! And the price was right too!
B00FSH0WM6|5|Great lights.  I have tried several different kinds and find I like these the best.  The pancake lights seem to put more light out than the circular ones, though my application is ceiling mounted RV lights.  For a 360 degree light the round ones may work better.  Definitely better than traditional lights for low power consumption applications.  I also like the bright white light.
B004H2INII|4|Excellent replacement! This is the second set I've used and am very pleased. Service is prompt and the brightness is great.
B002YPSUKG|5|Looks good, fits well on my jack, I haven't used it under load yet.
B000CIY0U6|1|It is not for an 2015 Sirrera gmc
B00G6LKFG6|4|Works great got it cut at my local lowes and start my bike right up. The red pieces does feel like a cheep plastic but it's still better looking then a plain key.
B0006IX850|5|Does a good job of cleaning out water heater.
B00B9XDOLO|5|Great value compared to other synthetic gear oils you really can't go wrong.
B00GBVHPNW|5|I love these gloves however they arrived with a loose thread on the part that Velcros around the wrist on the right glove. A bit of thread fixed this. What was not in the description, and is really cool, is the fact that they have air holes with screens on the middle knuckle area which allows the gloves to breath and keeps the hands from sweating with the airflow.
B00ARAJJ9G|5|works as described.
B00445L290|5|Best car vacuum ever!  This thing really sucks :)  in the good way :)  Very powerful.  I use it for the car and inside.  Would highly recommend.
B0021YZER2|5|This stuff gets the toughest to remove water spots on your glass. Use with caution though as it is caustic but then again if it weren't then it wouldn't work.  I doesn't matter HOW bad your water spots on your glass is because this stuff gets it off.
B001B0VP3E|1|Bought th black version of these grill inserts.  Had trouble snapping them into place.  After over a half hour they still would not &#34;snap&#34; in.  Drove to the store and back and one was gone th others all very loose.  Terrible product!  Returned them back to Amazon.
B000W3SI7M|5|Great cover
B003L31RHI|5|Highest quality you can buy in my opinion.  Never need to worry if product will do the job or last beyond expectations.  Worth the extra cost.
B00029WRMI|1|CHEAPEST CRAP EVER. Would never stay on a vehicle with just one tiny screw.
B0024JKT9W|5|Quality. No problems with this. Swapped it in place of the painless fuse.
B005T858KK|4|Just installed the Fender Flares yesterday.  Other than the fact that they (like most everything now-a-days) are of a plastic material, they look GREAT!  Installation requires a little thinking and patience, but a pretty easy install.  I recommend if purchased, you protect them well from the box to time of  install.  The reason is that if you lay them together or on the ground (rocks and dirt or asphalt, etc) they are not very scratch resistant.  Now that they are on, very satisfied with the look we wanted.
B004I1F3EK|1|Not able to fit my car even though advertised for it.
B00DE22CIE|5|Looks so awesome on my laptop 💻❤
B004JB056K|5|Great product
B000XECJES|5|Just what we needed for our windows & everything else!
B00YFFPPGK|5|This bumper sticker ended up on my window on my vehicle and looks very nice!  It is a very nice and durable sticker.  No problems putting it on and left no bubbles between it and the window. Would definitely recommend this.
B00PD0OC06|3|Graphics are tape and frame is general plastic. Not sure how long this will last.
B000IYR7R2|5|Quality merchandise. Thank you !
B0000AXNMO|4|Works but not long if you use wipers a lot as it wipes it off after a while
B001F0IE7A|4|Very good fit but after proper torque at 50 ft lbs the tongue still has a little more flex than I would desire . it seems there should be some shim washers in kit. Very nice unit overall.
B00CF280LM|5|Very impressed with the ease & quality of the product! I have definitely recommended this product to friends. I did the right thing choosing OPT-7
B0012PM06Y|5|Great savings from outlet store.  I purchased two ACDelco Front Struts.
B001O074JU|5|just installed these coils before towing a 8900 lb. fifth wheel through the mountains of New England<br />the supercoils worked great, gone are the skipping and hopping of the motor under acceleration or heavy loads<br />they seem to give better throttle response off idle and midrange rpms.<br />I can't say I got any better gas mileage, but you don't get good mileage anyway when you tow that heavy.<br />I don't think there was much of a horsepower increase either just the motor felt much smoother with better response
B0049MX7C8|5|Works like a charm. It adjusts from 0 to 12. I have mine set at 3.3 and it stops my 5,000 LBS rv with ease.
B0050HC3LW|5|Well made, de-burred ends with plastic caps, very well packaged, chrome is high quality.
B00J5QEK3S|3|I t make my body hot, well i live in florida, so maybe it is better for cold weather.
B004HMBK5G|2|Dose not hold the seat belt in place that to bad I had hoped it worked.
B000BUQOF4|5|Product arrived quickly and was as described.
B00GUHB8MG|5|It's hard to say I love a replacement thermostat, but it was a replacement for the OEM and fit as intended.  It also appears to be the updated version.  The original had a rubber gasket (internally) that deteriorated, causing problems.  This one does not have that gasket, so may last longer.  To clarify: this t-stat DOES come with the gasket that fits around the outside of the stat body, so it will seal the way it is supposed to.<br /><br />UPDATE 04AUG2016: This thermostat failed 361 days after I installed it.  It is staying open, which does not allow the engine to come up to its proper operating temperature.
B0048IZZH8|1|This does not fit a 1995 Chrysler lebaron as it states it does
B000C5CCHC|5|Item arrived as described in a hurry.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Perfect for my wife's Mustang
B00GA3RVSU|1|Please do not buy this amp!!! I purchased this amp and had it installed by my local Harley dealership. I was very disappointed, I called J&M corporation and spoke with one of their techs he asked me to have the Harley dealership uninstalled amplifier and send it to them that it needed to be tuned. I had the amplifier uninstalled send it to J & M they turned it and resent the amplifier to me. Harley reinstall the amplifier and still to my surprise the sound quality was not there(weak). I install J&M fairing speakers and saddle bag lid speakers along with the J&M 500 watts amp. I'm currently still use the speakers, but after several calls to J & M corporation, asking for help with the amplifier, I decided to try a Arc amp. It too is 500 watts and sounds much better than the J & M amplifier and it was much cheaper. Please beware of this amp before you buy it!!!!
B0009V1WS4|1|Bought this item in June, tried to remove it in August. One key didn't work at all, the other key got the lock off, but broke off in the process. This item is a piece of crap. Don't buy it.
B00027H1VM|4|Worked perfect grease mark was little off.
B001NZ0L50|5|Perfect fit for my 1998 Toyota Sienna.  Nothing more to ask for.
B00EVMT6A8|5|Very descrete appearance and provides good angle view.
B002JBDH26|5|good, like it and works as advertised.
B000GAN3GC|5|Hard to find this weight of full synthetic in the stores for some reason. Been using Valvoline for 30 some years now. Good stuff.
B004M6T25W|5|Shipped fast!! Fits like a glove!! seconds to put on!! recommend if you live off a dirt road like I do!!
B00N9LMXUC|2|Too thin.  It bends and falls down more often than not.  The suction cups provided are not holding, and yes I cleaned the window and lightly moistened the cup.  Needs more rigidity to do the job.
B0002KR88A|4|These seem pretty well made, and for the price, are a super bargain.  The quality is good, but the cap that covers the fuse doesn't snap on as tightly as on some other fuse holders I've used, that really snap on tight, and give the impression of being better sealed to the elements.  However, they also cost several times as much, so unless you need super-premium quality, these are a very good compromise between price and quality.  Again, not super-premium, but far from junk.
B000C9JH26|5|Perfect fit for my 91 Chevy Caprice.  Car has better braking response too.  Will save this purchase incase I need rear brakes after another 90k miles.
B000B69V2Q|5|It worked great. Perfect fit.
B00M0EX844|5|Have everything I can think of for a peace of mind. The alarm is very loud and will definitely bring attention if needed. The color is also very appealing.
B00AFO749Q|1|I thought the rilakkuma would look as pretty as the picture shown since they also made from Japan. It's turn out the bear looks totally different from the picture and ship from China. For a second product nearly become defective due to the zipper not working properly. I wouldn't buy this product.
B009B42GKI|5|I have installed a pair of these a month ago in my 2008 Mazda 3 and it fitted perfectly and the suspension is now working smoothly. It still early to judge how many miles they will last.
B0006SU3QW|4|Worked well to cover some areas on my black rubber covered chainlink fence that I had scratched up with the lawnmower.
B00IIN0AE2|5|very happy with my lights are fantastic package
B00K87WD8C|5|Great product
B0065WU5GG|2|Faded almost immediately
B00QO1ENMA|2|I give it a 2 star because the horn switch was not suitable for the horns and the relay was defective. I had to take a trip to auto zone to get more 16g wire and another switch so i can make it work. If you were a novice on wiring you woukx of return the product. Additionally, the hose provided is extremely short. Why it got 2 stars intead of zero? The horns are loud enough to turn heads. The compressor looks heavy duty. We will see if it last long enough. I will post again in 6-8 months.
B00EPDKLXE|5|Love em'!
B0056MPJBC|5|So nice! Size is perfect! Have gotten a lot of great compliments. Thanks
B00ACGI1GW|5|Exactly as described
B00JIHC36K|1|lights seem to flicker on and off quite a bit even with having resisters installed my old LED bulbs never had a problem and I only upgraded to these because I was looking for something brighter. Less than a week later one is already dead ugh save time and money and don't o
B001PWA0IO|5|Does what it said it would
B001TY6RXU|5|fit  Ford 8n tractor.
B002DLYR8A|4|Perfect for my purpose
B00QRHDIPY|5|Good product. Work as expected and fast shipment.
B003FBV8ZW|5|Nice way to get the glasses you need for riding. Keep them all with me in saddle bags. Sunglasses get most use. When it gets dark pull over and put on the clear and keep going. The yellow are for what? I'll try them on some time.
B003PJOR5W|5|Great package
B00X9D71XE|5|Awesome
B000F285EG|2|This lasted 4 months. I have a hi-lift jack mounted on the hood of my Jeep. The handle keeper split into two pieces. I am not sure how this happened.  There was no stress on the keeper, the Jeep stays in my garage when it is not driven (which is quite often since I have a company vehicle that I drive daily).  I thought this piece would last longer than it did.
B00PIJ96US|5|Personal protection and personal pleasure all rolled into one.
B003YNHVQQ|5|So my old light got intermittent. Grrr,, how do you know whats going on if the light doesn't work sometimes? Well, I generally like OTC tools, so I decided to give this a shot. So far, I'm very pleased. Small sharp point, bright light, long cord and very good clip.<br />I'll update if it lets me down or if I still love it.
B0002MADZ8|4|Easy and simple to install. Would definitely recommend
B008321LFA|4|Great gift
B0050EITTK|5|Works great! Soft water in the woods!
B000FKDDIQ|5|ok
B00RA41UD0|5|Just what we needed for motorhome and the price was great!
B000CF3W7G|5|Direct fit
B000EORRXK|5|I dust with these as they work on just about any surface - cleans the TV as well as the furniture.  They work really well, and one wipe goes a long way.
B000FGKBU8|5|Just what we needed
B004QJL5XW|1|Obviously not officially liscensed Mitsubishi merchandise. A knockoff logo glued onto a shiny key ring.
B00JRPDCVS|5|This tool works great
B005N6XHAG|2|Nicely made and very pretty.  But I had to return due to the sizing being too small.  Every long sleeve tee-shirt I own is a size large.  When this came I could breath in it after I got it on.  Company was very easy to work with and I returned it and got full refund.
B00965DDPE|5|Nice and looks good on the truck
B00RSOLXFM|1|Other than a blue LED light, this &#34;filter&#34; does nothing! Maybe I need a lab to test the air quality inside my vehicle before and during use of the filter. I purchased 2 filters, one for my wife 's large SUV and one for my compact car. Neither vehicle seem to smell any fresher, after trying for a month, we want back to the Fabreeze car clip-ons, a kit cheaper and way more noticeable. My advise, don't wait your money. I use ionic air purifiers inside my home, at bedrooms amd walk in closets, and I can feel/smell when those purifiers are on, the smell of ionized air is very distinct, I can't smell that inside my car.
B004K9KETY|5|It doesn't get any better.
B00NP60URE|3|The gauge on this lasted less than a week of regular use.  It has been in use daily for several weeks. The pin has popped out of the handle and had to be put back several times.  It's an ok product for the cost.
B00LE61UBW|3|It arrived in timely manner. Actually two weeks quicker than I expected. The reason I gave it 3 stars?  the zipper that attaches the back piece broke the first time I put it on. I thought I was going to be able to fix it but wasn't able to. But for the price it's decent in my opinion. I got one size bigger than what I am and I'm glad I did, it fits well. The air flow is awesome and it's so light that it doesn't feel like you are wearing anything really. The plastic protective parts are kind of thin but I think if I were to go down it would stop road rash at the least. It's not to shabby 3 stars worthy in my opinion.
B0009IBJAS|5|Keeps my truck battery charged, as truck is not a daily driver.
B002807VWU|5|These wheel locks fit great on my 2006 Prius.  Glad I bought them.
B0068FVSTI|5|Great bars. 1 1/2&#34; so get the correct clamps. Nice and fat.
B006HYA792|5|I love it !!!!!!
B00LG07MZE|5|This is a great product.  Really stopping the Texas sun on our Toyota Highlander.  Covers our big windshield perfectly.
B00J262R9A|5|Tuner works great! Performance tune is very noticeable. Tow tune is great when pulling our fifth wheel camper, really wakes up our 7.3L.
B000EVU89I|5|Works as it should, comes with the fitting required to use with old import bikes.
B00CUN13OW|5|Quick delivery. Fit perfect.
B00ELBCTBM|5|This wheel cover makes driving a breeze, works great.
B00H2VVM8E|5|I used this product to treat the rust in my John Deere riding mower's mowing deck. The thin layer that I applied, has become a very SOLID unbreakable barrier/layer. It is incredibly hard when it dries. Highly recommended.
B008BYQC6I|5|Love it
B00QMWQSAG|5|Exactly what I needed for my Ford Escape. They fit perfectly and they're durable for the time being. I'll wait until winter to invest into some rubber ones. Shipped fast and it was a good deal!
B000HBGHFY|5|Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint.
B00RH3AMIS|5|Exactly as described and shipped PROMPTLY.
B0076I5162|1|Doesn't fit my vehicle.  Not all of my year/model had filters, and this did not work in my truck.
B00BCRMAAS|2|Bad fitting for my Hyundai Tuscan
B00BTJN2GA|1|Spit and splatter. Had to repainted with ppg products.
B00SFKMRT4|5|Looks great in my car and dose what i wantrd it to
B00EDMN9KY|1|Just what I ordered but came broke probably due to shipping its kinda flimsy worth the money  if it makes it too you unbroken
B003YJNY9I|5|These worked great for my camper. I bought 2
B000GTUNHA|1|Snap came off already
B00GOZB17G|5|Works great with my Wilson antenna. Not rust !!!
B00PXMARLM|5|Excelente
B003NDM0QI|5|Installs easily and fits perfect. Haven't had it long enough to determine gas mileage or horse power improvements.
B00L888TVA|5|Better than I could have hoped. Fits perfect, looks great and provides security fro the elements. Great buy.
B00HVVVEYM|5|We have an SUV. Using this with a receiver cargo tray, allowed everyone to have plenty of room.  It was great.
B001K96GH6|5|good
B005R4J1QI|5|Perfect fit for 2002 F-150 5.4l
B0018J0Y44|5|Great screwdriver - very handy. I keep it with me at all times at work. Wish I could get the color I want though.
B000C5400E|5|Exactly what I needed. I used this as an upgrade for my Jeep Cherokee XJ. Moog is one of the best OE replacement companies that you can buy from.
B00X01LPM8|4|The only problem is that the cover comes with a metal wire to lock the cover  to the truck... The wire was too short.
B000EVYH7W|5|Nice advance wheel operated timing light but, take care for light duty case and will crack if care is not taken with housing.
B00XK2HTT0|5|Arrived on time and was as described.
B00W8MPDTG|5|Very bright light. Will buy more. thank you Sandy Song. Very nice customer service.
B00N0IHMXM|1|This is just what I needed to speed up the process of raising and lowering g the jacks.
B00EK4F19W|5|Looks great on my car!
B00LS5R0PO|1|I tried mine on a 2015 rzr 1000 with a 2500 warn winch and it didn't work all it did was the box clicked!
B00OC0XWKY|5|Fits a 2014 perfectly. Great product !
B005LGWRZY|5|Fit was perfect and color matches
B00CLEVRW8|5|Nice and clean, with a great finish.
B000EDUUH6|5|Good protector for your screen door.  Easy to install and all the hardware  was included.
B000C7TYLW|1|No Clue what this fits ,but it for sure does not fit the 2.0 engine on my 2001 Chevy tracker as stated ,if it fits another engine used in a 2001 tracker then they need to state it as they have in the alternator I am waiting to order as soon as  my refund appears in my bank account
B00ST0NWXU|1|The fabric came away from the snap. Did not work well
B00HV2KIHA|5|Good product and came on time through fedex.  It fit perfectly on the truck. No problems at all
B00ZSAX3N8|5|Great product. I will buy this again.
B0082365AQ|3|Stinks, like in smells. Had to store outside, couldn't even keep in garage.
B00E4CQGVW|4|Light weight and dark lenses,  love them.
B0023080PC|1|Wrong item image posted.<br />Picture said what parts exactly I receive.
B0000CBJC6|1|my fault thought it was something else
B000WK3NBG|5|Great - thanks..
B009WOIILS|4|Functions as expected.
B004LX14Z2|3|highly doubtful it lives up to it's claims. Very slow compared to my manual cart charger boost mode is useless
B00FY87XT4|5|Arrived on time, packaging sturdy and no damage from shipping.  Worked as expected, fit properly.  Part is somewhat different from Original on vehicle, but it worked great.  These don't last forever...and are a terrible way to control fan motor speed, but Dorman can't change that with a spare part.  The resistor bank included a new connector (which in some cases is the root cause of the failure) but my connections were in good condition, so I just changed the resistor.
B0059HJZO6|4|great for little projects.  If you've got a big project, go with something bigger, these will run out on you quick.
B000VJPRYO|3|fits nice but not really a deal
B00XN646I0|5|Great product easy install
B00TCO1B94|4|smaller than thought
B00P0Z6FMW|2|Dont use for fog lights, they are a dull orange. They didn't make much light. I have a 2015 Toyota Tacoma.
B003CETS7M|5|Got as a spare for just in case.
B0006FKDVK|2|Didn't work like I thought it would. Left a white residue that was difficult to come off
B00IKML56S|2|Item fits perfect but had finger prints and smudges inside the lights, obviously can't clean it unless I take the plastic lense off. Works perfect though.
B000CMJW64|5|Good fit, comfortable. Good price.
B0052WT8F4|5|great product fit perfect and was delivered quickly will do buisness again
B0024V84G0|4|quick delivery ,product as advertised.Its a battery ask me in a year if it is a good one.
B00SD2K2NC|2|DO NOT buy these lights if your planning to use them in the factory locations......they don't fit. They may be a greart light but I'll have to wait till i order headlight assy that they fit into. 2008 Mazda 6
B00RD982MO|4|It's working!
B000C5HVBY|5|OEM part, great quality and properly matches OEM underhood appearance.
B009EDOPW8|5|This magnet does miracles! I highly recommend this student driver magnet for the beginners who get nervous of people honking at them for going slow; it alerts drivers that you're new to the road, so they are more lenient. The sizing is great because it's not too big or small. It is just right. Great product for beginner drivers!:)
B00V30J86I|4|Good idea, good product
B001EAWOE0|4|The unit works great on my 2002 Tahoe, non-Bose with factory subwoofer. However, there are some things that should probably be explained:<br />A) You must have a CD or cassette (depending on what type of player you have) inserted for the head unit to allow you to switch to the AUX input. I just took an old cassette adapter and cut off the cord that stuck out from it.<br />B) Even though it is easier to fit in the console behind the tape deck, it won't work if you connect it AT the tape deck. The only way this unit will work if if you connect it at the back of the head unit. Otherwise you get a whole lot of nothing as far as sound is concerned.<br />Once I got all that figured out, this unit worked exactly as advertised.
B0012X0IME|5|Great
B004JMDV7O|4|Well built product. Fits my Polaris 2013 Polaris Sportsman 850 XP well.
B009OBVS2K|5|It really works! And is a great polisher in the process!
B0044B30TO|5|This is the exact same part which was in my car when I bought it.<br /><br />Ease of installation: Used instructions in YouTube to change the air filter. Simple steps and it took me 2 minutes to replace it.<br /><br />Do not have to go to a dealer to buy it. It ships to your door step.<br />Saves a lot of money if you do this yourself. I saved $100+ when I changed  the air filter and cabin filter myself.<br /><br />Note: Use common sense when working under the hood. Do not work when the engine is hot. etc.<br /><br />Overall the product is exactly what the description says it is.
B00ESLBPWO|1|Junk, small wires. Threw it away
B001CK14J8|5|great present for my son-in-law, Delivered fast!
B0053O9EUA|5|Great product
B001MOX4J2|3|Works good. Keeps coming out of the door and one of the switches just broke.
B00V97KY90|5|they worked very well
B004YGRCMA|5|adds a nice touch to the wheels
B004HCOE8Q|5|Meguiar's G19216 Ultimate polish was used today for the first time easy to apply and it help remove some of my swirl marks before I polish my car.
B000VNAIQ2|5|does the job excellently.
B000BD6FMI|4|helped
B000IYN81G|4|Nice replacement Could have been packaged a little better
B003G0KCCM|5|Excellent quality, they completely cover the floor and are very easy to clean. They had to settle for a couple of days before they fit perfectly, but after that they were great.
B00T6J3YDQ|5|:)
B00HHH1IUK|5|Great
B00MJ0RNFY|5|I thought these would get in the way of shifting. Fortunately, it doesn't.  Protects my shoes when am lazy to switch to riding boots. I know it's  silly but there are those days. Sprayed a bit of silicon and it installed easily. It has a hole at the end so it should let water flow out of it. Might not be 100%.  Only time will tell.
B001GC2LVM|5|I'm new to rving ....at 67 I purchased my first rv....a 30 ft 5th wheel. Took it up to roscoe park campsite where I parked in a grassy site that was uneven. I needed about a 3&#34; lift on one side of the rv....the anderson levelers worked just I'd expected....perfect on the first shot.
B00TKM5WSO|5|arrived promptly.  worked perfect.
B002ZI161W|5|Beautiful. I love it! Excellent service. Highly recommend!!!!
B00T1YADSU|5|Can not be more happy with this product!!!! I installed them and put them through the torture test last night. Water well over the hood, lights were mounted in the bumper a ( a foot lower than the hood ) no leaks or fogging. Not to mention there brighter than the older kc lights that i had on it. A must buy product for the price.
B00S204T52|5|awesome filter. works at what it needs to do. I had a K&N filter before and it kept falling off, and I kept putting it back on multiple times. I finally ran over it, and 2.5 inch filters are hard to come by. works as expected, clamps are tight, doesn't fall off, not sure if it's just me or if it's this filter but putting this on my cai just made my engine sound louder and more aggressive than the K&N one I had, at 1/3rd of the price.
B0002JMEQW|5|Very useful
B0052XN2ZA|3|The exhaust tip itself is fine...problem is, it doesn't fit my truck like the web site said it would.
B00FOKOKM0|5|Great item, it does its job as indicated . What I suggest costumer is to buy more than (1) 8.5 OZ., as good as the product is it can be deceiving as well .
B00449FFVM|4|bolted rite up and worked fine
B0002SA0BO|5|Just what I was looking for
B000DINKPQ|5|Paired up with 72102 for a great sound on the bike.....this WILL wake them up!
B001AJKMTY|5|Speedy delivery, birthday present and loved.
B00F2B80YK|4|Nice to have for checking my lawn mower rpm.
B003VLBPJA|5|Shipped fast, item as described. No complaints.
B00BV5V1FQ|5|This item worked well for me. Installation worked good
B000EQU0EG|5|Simple to replace. Just use a small screwdriver to pry out the old one. Disconnect the power cord. Plug the power cord into the new switch and push the new switch into position. Easy.
B008F8Q8K0|5|Works like a charm, just take your time installing it.
B002PQODUK|5|Product is exactly as described. Fit perfectly. Would definitely encourage others to purchase.
B004ZF3A94|4|They work great at night..but i have daytime running lights..so one side work but the other wouldn't so I would have to flicker the lights a few times to get both lights working during the day. But 4 stars they work with no problem at night though.
B00K0SCNRK|5|The A/C is great after a long day of working outside, It has great power! I normally use the heater that helps soothe my back pain as I drive. I have had my Viotek for almost 2yrs & I love it so I ordered my sister 1 for her car! The vent under the set doesn't allow the set to go down all the way so you end up sitting higher in ur vehicle then before & closer to the bottom of your steering wheel just account for that.
B00G8UHX24|5|I love this solo much its super sassy
B0046BFXD8|5|Nice
B00M3JTS5O|5|Awesome product for the cost
B00CJ3KIEY|5|Great
B00DVNF3AK|5|Love it
B009JG2BPS|5|Perfect,
B003E02MMC|4|Worked as expected
B00YVHGTBM|5|It's a great product that works as described.
B0073W281W|5|I like this little antenna
B004XXFUH8|5|They do the job
B004WLXKA0|1|after 10 days it is booken again !!!<br /><br />do get replacement ???<br /><br />call 0041 79 229 62 20
B001B9SL50|4|Since I have replace these on my car every few months, I like to keep a few on hand when I inevitably burn a bulb in the most inconvenient place possible. These seem to last a bit longer than the cheaper ones, worth the extra money.
B001BTQPVW|5|Great coat, had to return as it was a little to tight in the bust.
B001UR5XCW|5|Love it!
B001DRNA1U|5|It was everything we expected
B00BSOLB6E|5|Super cheap and great quality
B000IG208Q|5|Fits any visor.
B00XW66HV0|5|Better then expected!!!
B000IMHW9M|5|Works very well. I have tried lots of shepherds hooks, and this is it. It is a little clunky, difficult to use one handed and it's best to disconnect the lead when connecting and disconnecting. This was my second set, first didn't work. ??? I'll probably buy the smaller wire set soon...
B0051D3MP6|1|Beware! Very poor weather resistance!
B001KS7Y2I|5|Great value for OE replacments
B00VH8HRRI|5|Very cute!
B0049Z8X4C|5|Worth the money
B00O5U5VDW|5|Installed in about 20 minutes, removing the dead pedal is the toughest part. You need to pull back the siding to the left to get it out and get the new dead pedal into place. Great upgrade to an already great car. I would absolutely recommend purchasing to anyone!
B000I04Z7Q|5|Easy to mount and fun to witness with any high tempo music.
B00379ABX2|5|Nice
B000C2QMU8|5|ok
B00UWYQHQK|5|Great product and arrived quickly
B00QU70X7M|5|Bought this for our non-air conditioned popup trailer and it works like a charm over our bed.
B002QGVW3K|5|Very please with every think amazon
B009SAAK7G|5|Works great as a motorcycle aux light.  I installed a pair of these on my bike over a year ago and they have performed flawlessly.  Nice bright white light.  Good solid unit.
B007G2KIMK|5|Exactly what it said it would be.  Great rug for the yard to put over grass and allow the kids to crawl around. It's like a big beach mat.  Dirt brushes off.
B000M5ZVFC|5|These are great I used them for My XJ wheel bearing nut.
B00KMDBJNM|2|Pretty flimsy.  Not worth the amount I paid for it.
B004HII1G6|5|fit perfect look great
B00BQJTYW4|5|This was a present and she loved it. She received it in 2 days. Great Job!
B00JDTUCTS|5|Super cute sticker on my car! Great quality vinyl and stuck on the 1st try.
B002VE3VHW|5|GREAT PRODUCT FOR PRICE PAID
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Love this light bar it looks killer on my can am
B000EQW1AC|4|I am concerned that I had to replace both of them for the same reason ( thermal failed ) I question the materials used when designed.
B000EVWDU0|4|Works great
B00P8DEXFC|5|Five stars. I love the coverage these give
B000EDUUIA|5|Works well.
B0002Q81W6|1|Did not fit the harness I bought, I had to dremel the crap out of it.
B002DWBCX2|5|Great matching color, and glad the button/clip holes were there for the front driver's side. Unlike the original dealer mats, these have the textured, teeth-like, carpet grip backing that will keep them in place., a bonus!
B0002JN2EU|5|added a bottle to my 2003 auto and the fuel injection started working better almost immediately.  Highly recommend!
B00LXAMVOE|5|Fits perfectly in my 2016 Golf R. Fast shipping also.
B0040DX7EO|5|Works amazing and you see all your blind spots!
B00CU79KTS|4|These seem to be more durable than the other bifocal sunglasses I have been buying. They are also cool looking.
B000AA4RWM|2|weak product, The actual plastic leveler (green thing) fell out on one of them, not useable anymore,  the tap is also very crappy... don't expect it to hold up in the elements, especially in high heat/sunlight areas... Might want to replace with better double stick brands..  If you want quality, this probably isn't the right direction.
B00HPE6PQM|5|works good
B00JH2JBHU|5|Perfect quality. Fast delivery in Canada.
B007Y556X0|4|Excellent product that fits the 2008 Honda Element EX perfectly (exact windshield match). Stiff enough to stand against the windshield with a little help from the sun visors. Helps to prevent sun damage on dashboard and steering wheel and keeps interior cooler on a very hot (105F+) day.
B006ZZTCDU|5|Woeth every penny.  Don't look at the more expensive ones. These stands are sturdy and I do not see them failing period.
B0035R3Q3S|5|installed with no problems in a mazda 6 04. So far no problems with new strut. Be aware that this is a generic picture and strut does not come with dust boot and strut bumper. You have to buy that separate. it only came with the strut nut and a type of bearing that goes in the shaft.
B004R35MQI|2|Bulky and heavy and sticks out far from the car. Bike swings without using some sort of tie downs. The ensemble bolts together in the middle which doesn't make sense in regards to theft. You get what you pay for.
B00FRJH5WU|5|Works great for the bike rack on my corolla
B0084L0YR6|5|Worked beautifully, had the problem fixed in under an hour
B00G1YF068|3|Need resistor installed on each bulb @ &#62; $10 ea
B000N37D7W|5|Worked perfectly.  Did the job I bought it to do.
B005ESU1JI|5|Perfect fit and great quality! Highly recommended
B006WQSWQA|5|Purchased these about 18 months ago and have about 12000 miles on them now. They seem to be excellent quality and fit my vehicle perfectly. No issues with the ABS at all.  Proper installation is essential as is using a torque wrench to your vehicle manufacturer's specifications whenever you install any parts. Improper installation and over or under torquing replacement parts will lead to premature failure. These hubs have met my expectations and show no signs of premature wear.  I would buy these again.
B00R9BREJI|5|Exactly as advertised! Scratch easily, I recommend switching them out when lifting the rear of your bike.
B00843V9G4|5|Nice staff
B006QZ7Z4W|5|Product as advertised. Works well
B0000BX6Q7|1|I was thrilled with M17, but now I am just angry - I don't know if the problem was the M18 or M17- I used it to take the oxidation off my convertible's window- It did a great job- I removed as much as I could with a soft rag- but then something weird happened- when it rained, some of the residue was washed off the window onto the fabric around it- wherever it touched I have white staining and white dots- they seem impossible to remove. I am going back to the glowing review I wrote for the M17 and change it.
B00O2BIS70|5|Great Product. Great Price.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
B001EAQTRI|5|When I plugged my Samsung Galaxy into my car and also used an audio cable to listen to music off my phone, I'd get an awful hum in the background. This thing fixed all of that, and now I can both listen to music/podcasts and charge my phone at the same time.
B00A66GYDA|5|Work great
B000M5Y720|3|i just installed these in my AMG, replacing the Phillips ones that were in it.  it took almost an hour.  when i was finally done, i expected to see &#34;white&#34; rivaling the xenon of the headlights.  FAR from it.  the color temperature of these must be at least 2000K difference between the HID and these.  i haven't yet tried them at night.  i cannot imagine that they won't work well.  they are running the lamp very hot to get that power and color temp so, they'll probably be quite bright.  but bright yellow-white.
B00EC0Z1I0|5|Perfect fit. Easy to install
B00030BFN8|5|Very well built. I am replacing an old Sears 6-12V charger that I have had for 45 years. I don't expect to live another 45 years, but if I do, then I will let you know how it compares over time.
B009L0E3N0|4|Easy peasy
B001LEQ32S|4|Fit really well.
B003VPIES6|5|product as advertised.  Priced reasonably.  Good delivery time.  Thank you
B00EUUNJRM|5|excelente
B00D1ASSY6|5|Good for price quality not bad just wire too thin but have to be careful that's all ! Good
B005N53C9I|4|worked great
B006TMM9V6|5|excellent part, fast delivery
B0023VISOO|4|Fit perfect to my honda !
B000EDOT9Q|5|A+
B00BEHPYH2|3|Works good. But cheaply made. Spring key isnt as strong as oem
B000EVWDAK|5|IT WORKS RIGHT ON THE SPOT!
B00KMYYRYE|4|Please be sure to read all instructions and warnings before use. I had to wait a few days until we had a few warmer days before use. I decided to not use it in my home as the warnings of it causing cancer by the state of California. I used it on the molded plastic inside my car that I am not touching all the time. My car is 10 yrs old and I can say the interior looks showroom new again. I had an area I had tried to mount a GPS years ago and the sticky stuff came off but left a shadow that is gone now. I chose to wear disposable gloves and have the car doors open as it tells you to use in well ventilated areas. You must come behind it with clean dry paper towels immediately as it doesn't dry on It's own. I am very pleased with the results. I plan on keeping this car for many more years and it is so nice to have it look new. Again I just stress the fact to follow safety directions.<br /><br />I do remain concerned about the safety of the product. I feel hesitant to use without gloves and open a... Read more
B00EAJKX0Y|5|Worked
B003ZGKKD8|4|Excellent product...
B00B637XPA|5|It did not fit my custom built.<br />They gave me a refund with no issues even though it was my fault.<br />I wish it would have fit my bike
B002XM5G70|5|Good unit that performs as described. Not too noisy, the mounting feet are rubber-like to minimize vibration being transmitted into mounting surface.
B004OZCG7W|5|This isn't my first battery clip. I had one that came with the probe and somehow lost it so purchased this one that is a perfect fit.
B0056DPYPC|5|Great quality and fit perfect
B00EOAL22C|5|Very nice what better way to honor and miss my birth place here in the Midwest
B0009I1WF0|5|The quality seems to be better than other wheel covers I have had in the past and the fit is very good.
B0051F174W|4|It was perfect for I needed it for
B004I1BC04|5|Thanks a lot for your, outstanding customer service , i was very satisfied with my purchase.
B009LNIFFE|5|It is difficult to overstate the improvement in performance I experienced in my 2006 Duramax LBZ (327,000 miles)... absolutely outstanding.  Thank you for a phenominal product; and, the filter delete works great and looks cool too.  Great products.
B000FW7V50|5|The good stuff
B00E6XBFMO|1|It didnt work for my bike i had to file down the fuel switch in order for it to clear my gas tank to turn the fuel on!!!!
B001D9E41I|4|I put this on the door into the bedroom last summer. Helped great with light/heat. Also put a pillow in the ceiling vent. Finally!!!  Sleeping in a little was possible.<br /><br />I used Command Strips by 3M to put up and they worked great. Like REALLY great. Maybe too great.<br /><br />Last week we were pulling out and I was doing the last walk-around to make sure exterior was ready for the road. Found the glass in the bedroom window door was out of place. It had dropped down inside the frame leaving a inch or so gap. Turns out the reflective cover had reflected so much heat back at the window it had caused the plastic window frame to melt and deform.<br /><br />We taped up the glass back in place with duct tape and headed out anyhow. The glass dropped again in transit. It rained heavily at one point of the drive.  Command Strips kept the reflective  cover in place and also kept the rain from coming in.
B000GZNEHK|4|It fits my 2007 EX650 with Cortech saddle bags and tail bag. It seemed to keep the bike dry during a recent heavy rain.
B001L9ZH20|5|It is a great sticker. I put it on my deer dressing kit. :)
B005HIO9KM|1|This was supposed to a replacement for a defective part but this had the same defect as the first one.  The whole lot is bad, so I have done this job twice for nothing.  thanks eracings/amazon for a p-o-s. I'll be sure to let all know?<br />!
B000MD4YKM|4|Works great. Wish I would have skipped buying the cheap one first...
B000FLLWGA|5|Great
B00651C65U|5|Works well
B00G620ZVU|5|These are great LED lights  for the cost! Been on my truck for over 3 months now and I have had no complaints. A previous review said no possibly silicone the holes where the wires go in. THIS WORKS GREAT! I have driven in rainy weather multiple times and power washed the truck and my lights are still dry. 5 stars for how great they are for so cheap. Obviously not as bright as Rigid, but still great
B00810JYUS|5|The bars came in quickly and no damage. All good
B002MEOZNK|5|Awesome
B0007OWD2M|5|I've been using Invisible Glass since the '90s when I first discovered it. Last month I was about out and while visiting the local auto parts store I was going to buy another bottle. But, when I saw the price I was a little shocked. They had their house brand in a larger size for half of the price so I decided to save some money and get that. What a mistake. The cheap, off brand cleaner was total garbage. I would have been better off filling up the empty Invisible Glass bottle with water than the streaky, filmy mess their cleaner left. Lesson learned. If you buy Invisible Glass at Amazon (as an add-on) or the local big box retailer it is still reasonably priced. Even if I had to pay what Autozone charges it is worth it to get clean, streak free windows.
B002UD0GFE|5|This is awesome stuff. I use it on my motorcycle windshield, headlights and rear brake light. Easy to apply and buff out, the end result leaves a high  polish and shine
B002UC1ANW|5|It fits perfectly and now the water stays in the bowl when needed!
B000CC99MQ|4|Works as promised.
B006QGD996|5|these arre great ---for longer needs put 2 together.  I use them to support leaning palm trees
B001KOGFEA|1|Wrong picture, seller was very unhelpful.
B001MOSELU|5|👍
B00HJEUUKU|1|i have a 2005 Nissan frontier put these in the tail lights and it blue the fuse several time in a row after i upgraded to a bigger fuse the lights didnt work right aways so becareful with this product
B006OOOA70|3|On the first use one of the loops to stake it down ripped off
B000EQS1XS|4|just as described
B00OSB2CUS|3|extang make this one  almost a little too small it just barely fits from front to back half inch on the front and back I will watch it over time<br />I wish Ford or extang would make a better seal for the front
B0002L683A|5|I order this sunshade for my Acura Tsx. It fits perfectly like it was made for this car. The reflective surface should be facing outward.
B000JFJLP6|5|Powerful. Started a car right up that had a dead battery and had been sitting for 3 months. On the first time. Wow.
B0007RVL9A|3|Good....not amazing
B002M4E0VC|5|This stuff really works! i have had a slow leak in my cooling system for awhile.I kept topping it off time after time and I just couldn't  track down. It wasnt enough of a leak to drip and leave a trail. So rather than taking it in to get it pressure tested I decided to try this. since i didn't have any coolant left to lose anyway. I did buy a 21 led light at the same time.(see my review on that).<br />I topped the radiator off and put the contents in , closed the cap and ran the engine for about twenty minutes. I really didnt see anything. So I had to go on some errands and drove around for a few hours and went home and had dinner. The engine had cooled down and i shined the light  all around the engine compartment and sure enough, there was this little spot of bright yellow. It was a loose hose clamp that had the smallest leak. I tightened up the clamp and looked around to make sure there was nothing else to see. I had some engine degreaser and sprayed down the area that had shown a leak and took a drive. when i came back i checked every thing and no yellow dye!! I had gotten very lucky it wasnt something else. I drove it another couple of days just to make sure everything was all right. Then I fluhsed the system and reinstalled fresh coolant
B004IYVJOA|5|Excellent replacement
B005JU61D6|5|These are great wiper blades. Installed on a Ford vehicle to replace the original equipment wipers. Fit & work great.
B00S0W68CE|5|Great price and not to mention I don't have to drive to the store.  Great quality!
B00OBWSAG4|5|Looks and fits perfect, it is looks like OEM not like other aluminium fat replacements. If you are going to lower you bike or adjusting back from lowered to standard parameters then you need to replace your factory side stand with this one.
B008RAEKDS|5|Worked perfectly no leaks
B00IKPOSY6|4|A little tight fit on installation but worth the price and function.
B003TQ4UJO|5|Great driving shoes<br />Very comfortable. Can wear all day and not kill my feet
B00JVLP590|5|Very Nice
B00407TU5U|5|Matched my Ford Taurus exactly. I used it to paint over Bondo around the fender.The spray can works much better for larger spots than the typical touch up bottle, due to its wide and even spray. Plus it is a much better value.
B001GF2Q50|3|Generally these are good quality covers, but this one for the IS300 does not fit well -- it's so short that it's hard for the sun visors to hold it in place.
B00KV8U20O|5|Great color. Really is that luxury brand white look without looking like a cheap blue bulb. Great upgrade.
B000E28C7M|5|Very good filter for our motorcycle
B00LWDVKD0|5|Looks great
B00SQX3KDC|3|COOL STUTT
B000AP8EQW|4|I installed it in literally 10 seconds. Fit easily. Raced the same day I got it. Don't know how much hp I gained but I feel like my car does breathe easier.
B00BZSDRFG|2|Purchased this because it was OEM part, very nicely made, to the same quality as the original top.<br />but i have know idea how they think this is to fit a 4 door soft top, just not big enough?<br />im very mechanically inclined and they say the top should fold down to 3&#34; and there is no way!<br />I thought that this cover may be for a 2 door model, and it says 4 door. I gave up after 2 hours of<br />messing with it. Read reviews of other brands and it seems they have the same problem?<br />I guess I will try again, a different day. very frustrating...
B009W9AUS2|5|This thing is brilliant and very clever. I had to go out and buy a set of ring pliers but they were only a few bucks and it makes it very difficult for someone to remove the plate.
B008SGXRAI|5|Very smooth ride.  I've had several lifted Jeeps before and this was the first time I'd used Fabtech.  I don't know how to really explain myself.  It's kind of one of those things where you have to drive it for yourself to see the significant difference in the ride.  As a matter of fact, it rides better than the stock version.
B000EQTVGY|4|The part was perfect and so was the price, but the shipping was slower than I had hoped for.
B0012TTAWM|3|Be advised that although the picture shows 2 knobs, you only get 1 knob.
B001G6MMJO|4|did it's job well
B000EQ9OB6|5|work exelent
B004SG31NU|1|Faulty electrical connector and had to return it.
B000JZSPBM|5|worked a wonder, even fixed a squeaky rear gate.
B002E581BY|5|Autozone wanted $110 . Plastic wheel instead of metal .<br />Happy wife...
B004BTL5DW|1|I received this June 24/2015. Failed on 8/9/2015. It lasted just long enough to fail after my Amazon return window ended!!!! It ruined my ignition coil in the process!!!  Total piece of garbage!
B006VEHO8U|5|Helps to make the seat belt more comfortable... It used to dig into my neck.
B00JA3BMDW|1|Didn't have laser light. Returned it.
B009X9KGIU|5|Good product
B000EPPFMY|1|This fitting does not fit my 2004 jeep grand cherokee laredo. The fitting that I need is 11/16-16 which I can't seem to find. However, if you have access to a  lathe, I cut the two piece female fitting apart and modified the original nut put them together and it works great. On the original fitting I had to drill the hole out bigger and then flatten out the bottom of the threaded hole.
B0019SF4LM|3|Just not very bright ... not sure I should have expected more.
B0067ECS6W|5|Thanks You!!!
B009DJU6TY|5|It's fit perfect on my expedition
B000CNAOKQ|5|the choke kit was easy to install and works great !!!
B00MMR3FUQ|2|I was a bit disappointed. After a few months of everyday use for my commute, he pocket zipper came off. Apparently the fabric on which the zipper is down does not hold he suture and unweaves.  Everything else is perfectly ok on the pants.
B00ZFYY0KC|3|Looks good and large viewing area but not very adjustable. On my Polaris RZR I cannot seem to get the mirror to adjust high enough to see behind me.
B009DJTETW|5|Easy to install on my 2002 Acura 3.5 RL
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Best sunshade I've owned.. twists/folds away in seconds and shows away behind my seat.. much better than the 3 foot long/blinding/aluminum foil looking ones.. buy it..
B000C2UCHC|2|The house leading up to the reservoir tank needed to be about an inch longer.
B0040CU00E|2|did not fit my 2005 mazda 3. way too small.
B001UC8WMA|5|Quality A+, works just fine, no issues as some had reported.
B00JAS557Q|5|I received them within a few days! And I live in Hawaii!  They look amazing on my bike and the fact that they include the relays as an added measure shows that they care about making sure it works the first time!
B004ME11FS|5|Great price for this quality hose.
B00KQXKG46|4|Great light bar for the price, very bright. Only problem I have had is that moisture has accumulated behind the glass. Gonna get some clear silicone to try to fix the problem. Will update to see if it fixed it. Would have gave 5 stars if i wouldnt have had moisture problem.
B00D3298A0|1|Too thin & inflexible to be used for Amy length of time.  If you want floor mats that are if good quality & that will lay for awhile, DO NOT BUY THESE!
B00V4PRWS8|1|this is my second key shell replacement for the RR sport, and it is a total disappointment.<br />The first one I bought on amazon from another vendor looked like an exact replacement with bottoms built into the skin.<br />Not this one. this is a cheap cut out piece of plastic with separate bottoms that are awkward to push.<br />I have paid $14 for this lesson. do not buy this.
B0012QP7EA|5|Went to an auto parts store and they charged me around $100 for the exact same switch, so I bought this won for around $45 and returned the other one. Works great, If you are capable install it yourself it is really easy and there are videos to help you.
B00UA65S92|5|Great - thanks..
B000C5I2YO|5|Made my worn pad like new
B004XLBMA4|1|It didn't work for me
B00EFDW43O|5|perfect fit for my 2011 4 runner installed both in under 5 mins
B00E1SJTTU|5|Fits great and looks amazing. I would buy this a hundred times over if i could.
B00QMWQK2M|3|Nice for the price
B00ISC7S1G|5|Very fast. Good thx
B00KL3ALGO|5|We received the shades quickly and used them recently on a long trip.  I love how easy they are to place on the windows!  I just wish they were a little bigger.  For comparison sake, I also have the Brica Stretch-to-Fit sunshade.  I like the stretchy ability of that one since it does cover my entire back window - even going over the vertical window separator (with the part of the window that doesn't go down).  But this shades much better and I'm not worried about the suction cups popping off like the the Brica one.  Thanks for making a great product!<br />Edit: after having used this product for a while, we had to stop using it on the window nearest the carseat as my kid would easily pull it off and chuck it on the floor.  Every time we got in the car.  We went back to the stretch sunshade because she can't get that one off.
B007JW8ROS|5|These look very nice on the tires. Makes the rims look complete. Must have for every Infiniti.
B000CMHN3I|4|I bought it to complete a set ... it has worked fine up to now.
B000C9GLEI|5|Exact OEM part for my 1994 Blazer with a 5.7.
B004BTBUXC|4|These floor mats look beautiful and seem to be made of high quality material. I've only had them for a few weeks so far, but they have held up wonderfully. Only thing to note is that they do not fit my 2000 Honda Civic perfectly. They are a little too wide in areas, and there isn't a way that I can trim them to fix the issue. Regardless, they still look great in my car!
B001PQDMY4|5|Exact fit for 2004 330xi
B0079DGNMU|2|This is not the easiest to install on a Honda CRV 2014 EXL. I thought it was just a quick thing to do from looking from the reviews online. You need more than a screwdriver to install this (such as phillips and allen wrench). Furthermore, it interferes with the BumperDuo bungee cords if you're using one of these. If you're looking for a functional splash guard, this might be a tad small to give the desired protection. This gives a nice handsome look but the mud flap splash guards are better for the intended purpose.
B000GV3W62|1|They dont fit my rim. The spokes are longer and smaller diameter compaired to stock 21&#34; ktm spokes. Really wasted my time.
B00W58P1AY|4|Could be brighter
B002UJVNFA|3|They are nice especially for the price.  My only complaint is that I don't have enough of a bridge as far as my nose is concerned and they sit too low on my face.  I'm going to have to jerry-rig it somehow so that I can wear them.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Even with the reviews about the excellent brightness, I did not believe fully until they were installed and tested at night. They ARE really bright. I put these on a '04 Jeep Grand Cherokee Brush Bar, to make trips to the woods coon hunting safer. Used LAMPHUS CRUIZER wiring harness for wiring. Great pair. See my review for wiring kit, and push bar. I will be ordering another set for my golf cart. The price is also excellent.
B006N9I3FQ|4|Great Product
B0085OLEBM|5|I bought this when I bought my traverse . It is so pretty. Almost as pretty as my Traverse ........ Good quality Good price ! Worth the buy . Love my car also ❤
B00T62RK1U|4|I installed these to replace the original docking lights on my pontoon boat. Although I have not actually used them for their intended purpose yet, I did turn them on at night while the boat was on the trailer and they lit up a lot of area in front of the boat. Can't wait to go night fishing and try them out.
B00OP98OSM|4|The colors are beautiful and striking.<br />The material of the sticker is thick and soft and places easily.<br /><br />Because I am not a fan of the thick white outside edge, I trimmed it before placing it on my car -- I wouldn't recommend this as I believe that may be the reason that it gets just a bit more washed out each time I wash the car.  This is not normal fading since it is not all over -- just appears to be water seeping in where I cut the border down.<br />So, if you can live with the white border (or if you are not going to run it through the car wash if you can't) then you should be fine with this otherwise truly beautiful item.
B00TH8UN12|5|Love my ravens
B000S2SKIY|5|Easy to install, works like it should, no check engine light!
B00198F9YE|5|Works great
B007IT97W8|5|Exclente
B008G4Y076|5|Great product, super bright lights (compared to stock lights)..
B010IQ9SJY|3|Could work with a 35-star Union banner on the pickup...
B00E9HWS9G|5|Had to cut for fit, very nice for the price
B0002CO9LW|5|Just had 2 of these lights installed on my roof rack along with 2 KC driving lights, and I absolutely love them. These lights are incredible, the slim black finish and cage guards are very sleek and well built. They are super bright, especially with 4 of them in a row. Lights of this quality are definitely worth spending the extra money on, especially when I've had other plastic lights that don't hold a candle to these in terms of performance or ruggedness/durability. I'm really glad I went with KC.
B00TY3730O|5|Perfect
B00KRQHMLM|5|Great looking decals.  Makes seeing what is in each box a no brainer.
B00GEIIQ12|5|This relay harness works great. No issue during install and the connector actually fits correctly compare to some other brand that cost more. The length is good also. I will write an update after a few month of using this relay harness.
B0002MBKAA|4|Before even trying to put it on the wheel of my 2003 Ford F-150 Super Crew (Lariat) I made sure to warm it up with a hair dryer...takes a bit of muscle and maneuvering but it goes on and is snug on the wheel
B000V5K8DI|5|Great product, this is the 2ND time we have use this.
B00NLOLL5K|4|Perfect fit in my car, a great item!
B003F6LZB4|5|Works great
B00AZPP0Y6|5|Why get one thats 4 ties the $$
B0058SQGS4|5|great product
B00I0AZDUO|3|On the description it stated that it was adjustable from 12&#34; to 17&#34;.  When I got it the item was not.  Other than that it is a good adapter for the price
B000CIT3OE|5|perfect fit no leaks
B00DHJQF5K|5|good
B00HFWZ1NW|5|These are great. They are Cayley thick and heavy duty! They fit right in my truck. I actually wore a hole in the rubber of my current mats and am excited to try these out! I was offered a discount on this item in exchange for my honest review and it came at perfect timing! I will defiantly be reccomends get these l.
B004WLL0OI|5|It's a really good product I would recommend this to anybody that owns a Toyota tundra
B00SY01EQC|4|It's a nice &#34;Budget&#34; manifold for the builder looking to get some extra horsepower while saving a few bucks. Not many of us hobby builders need let alone can afford a FAST manifold which is nearly a $1000 for the base model. I'm aiming for 500+ HP from my LS408 so I decided to buy this manifold. As far as the construction of this manifold, there are some irregularities in the ports and throttle body mounting opening. Nothing that would cause it not to do the job. The manifold is sturdy and looks like it will hold up to any N/A and boosted application.  I haven't installed it yet, but when I do I am definitely going to have it dynoed.
B005FWWUNS|5|he loved it
B0010E3IV8|5|Great filter.
B00RV83UUG|5|Gets a little condensation behind lense but can be fixed with clear silicone. Very bright and great light bar for the price!
B003VLBPJA|2|It's ok not awesome but ok
B00GDA6BZ4|5|Didn't  use this after all
B008AV969C|5|i like it and fit as well but when u open the hood it's open very fast and that maybe will damage after long time for that reason
B00BYH6C1E|4|These actually work!
B00SL2NFLA|5|But I want to buy anther Gallon and the price keeps going up . Bought the first Gallon for 18.95 and then it went to 25.00 now today 30.00 !!!!????
B000BQQWKA|5|Does a great job keeping the s**t where it is supposed to be
B00Z8F2UA0|5|I don’t bother to write product reviews unless the product really makes an impression on me.  Believe it or not, these car wash mitts are worth taking the time to review.  They arrived very quickly in attractive packaging.  They won’t easily get lost in the garage with the bright color, and I don’t foresee them looking dirty or dingy after repeated use.  But what was truly impressive, is the function!  One mitt has a scrubbing side that is good for quickly sudsing and on the flip side it has a surface (see the black side in photos) that is fantastic for safely removing bugs and tough dirt without scratching the paint of my motorcycle.  The other mitt is a really soft microfiber that dried my bike… NOT LEAVING STREAKS.  I only had to wring it out once in the process of drying  The mitt is absorbent, leaving a nice shiny, polished look.  I have do have large man hands so the mitts fit snugly, however it is my personal preference (as with all mitts) to not wear them anyway.  I highly recommend this product!
B008G20RL6|5|Fit was excellent. Installation was basic after opening bottom wheel well to access lower side bolt. All  lights were included and worked. These lens have given new sight and a fresh look for this old 2005 Tacoma!
B00N58M6CO|4|Better than most I have owned.  Super convenient and use more often than the huge bricks I have had in the past.
B00SRW9DVA|5|This mask is cool looking, I really like how it looks on. It fits properly as well & does not fall off.
B0050QJME4|3|It did not fit my wife's 11 Impala. I had to do some alterations to it to fit over the headrests or send it back and wait for a replacement or refund.
B00JIIZCM6|5|I tried this leather cleaner out on my old vintage jacket that I've been wearing off and on for the past fifteen years.  It's been around.  I've never washed it or had it dry cleaned.  Thinking back about all the parties and smoky bars I've worn it to, not to mention the fact that I smoke inside my apartment, it must have a ton of residue covering the surface.  The cleaner comes with a good sized microfiber cloth that you use to apply the cleaner from the spray bottle.  I tested it out on the inside of the coat first and disappointingly didn't notice much of a difference.  On the plus side, it didn't discolor the leather.  Feeling braver, I applied it to a dark spot on the outside of the coat.  After maybe 30-45 seconds of massaging the cleaner into the leather, the spot disappeared.  Likewise for another spot I found.  It didn't buff out the scratches in the leather, but it isn't polish or conditioner so I wouldn't really expect it to do so.  I'll be going back over the entire coat when I get some more time.  The areas I was able to get to show a noticeable improvement.
B000C2GF8M|5|Good quality gasket and fit.
B004HFIQWS|5|Riding well
B00AFQF6OO|5|Just like i learned from other folks, my 2003 6.0psd with 170,000 is like a new machine. 3 weak injectors all pumping smooth now . took 5 mins to see results
B005C57H7M|3|The look is nice . easy to install. Only thing is started turning yellow due to sun. And hard to keep clean .
B010H0QV7S|5|This DBPOWER 5-in1 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge/Multi Tool is quite a nice little gadget to have. This is a tire gauge with an LED digital display. Very clear and easy to read and there is a good amount of light with the LED backlight display. Also checks in 4 different pressure units:  PSI, BAR, KPA and KGF/CM2, and accuracy to +/- 1 PSI. Takes 2 AAA batteries that were not included but not an issue with me because I always keep extra batteries in the house.<br /><br />The 4 other tools that come on this is a flashlight, seat belt cutter, glass breaking tool and a red safety light. Nice in size with a perfect weight. Can keep in your car or garage or even toss in your purse or duffel bag if you wanted. Comfortable to hold and use and has a rubber gripping handle. Definitely loving this and the emergency extra are great on this and I would completely recommend this!<br />**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.
B005F9IMFG|5|I had to engineer the install, but it was 1/3 the price of others.
B00K61CG5U|1|Did not &#34;plug and play&#34; even with load resistors. The bulbs would turn on for a few seconds and then flash repeatedly.
B000I4JPZE|5|These are very well made, very sturdy, and Made in America. That deserves 5 stars in my book.
B00DEVI2PW|5|Good product. Work as expected and fast shipment.
B000ARPVQ6|5|My husband got this oil filter for his 2004 ford f350. He said he liked it. The quality of the filter is outstanding and it fits well.
B002FY22H8|4|well pleased received in good order and fast shipping high beam lamp stop working in 3 days.
B0006IX87S|5|My second filter, workes great.
B0060DZN0I|1|How come mine only came with one filter
B0002JM8PY|3|Returned, leaked.
B00CU79L9M|3|I bought these for my brother because he has very sensitive eyes and needs very dark lenses and at $5 I thought he could give these a try and give me back my sunglasses. Well there is one major problem these things are tiny and when i say tiny i mean put on a child's pair of glasses tiny. the width is fine it's the lenses and lens holder that are tiny.  He still wears them and my sunglasses over them. I am glad I have clip-on's.<br />Be warned if you have a large head you will look like you are wearing a pair of Child's sunglasses. Still if you want a laugh buy them and see for yourself if your head is larger than others^^
B000C7YQ10|5|Installed perfectly!
B001VBWR7Q|5|Very good seller to work with. Awesome product
B0000AZ6NH|5|These are so quick and easy to securely tie down my boats. I am confident in the holding ability of this product. Well made
B0031ZDU62|5|Yes they are great works well no problem.  Will buy more of them.  Thanks
B00144B32A|1|I thought I could use this on my boat, but when I received it it says do not use near the water because it is toxic! Now since my boat is on a lift, it is absolutely useless to me! This was not stated in the description that it is toxic to marine life.
B0009TO4FE|4|this is only a 20 micron filter but good as a primary.
B002PLB2D6|3|I have not finished the installation, but one thing I expected, that it does NOT have is a button to put operation in automatic.  You can put in on Propane, or put it on AC, but my old refrigerator had a selector that automatically changed it back and forth.  Turn on the generator and it went to AC.  Turn off the generator and it automatically switched to Propane.  This one is either/or, but not auto.  I will update this review when I'm finished with the installation.
B003CH3Z8W|5|Works great
B00TQ4IR9C|5|Fabulous product a must get for your amg mercedes benz or if you want that aggressive look !
B00R97QIMG|5|Bushings worked perfectly for Highlander rear knuckle.  This is the only company I've found that makes these bushings.  Even Toyota wants you to buy an entire knuckle.
B000CMGHJE|5|Nice quality. Oem
B0042AH4X0|4|Part works but needs to be modified slightly to work on a Tj.
B003YJLAIK|5|Excellent product.  Easy to adjust.  Gauge is well built.  A must have for real RVers.  The inline plastic and brass are garbage.  But good to keep one on hand as a back up.  Not sure why I waited 10 yrs to look for one of these.  Now I have good flow and pressure mtater what RV park I stay at.
B001AGP7WY|1|I dont recommend this muffler not that quiet. When i received it bunch of dent... I got no choice just install it
B00MN963JS|5|I bought this product for my husband to use, especially when doing yard work. He loves how breathable it is. We live in south Texas, so it is really hot outside and this face mask is thin enough to not feel like you are suffocating, but still keeps him from breathing in dust, dirt, and other things. He absolutely loves the skull design on it. He has already used it multiple times and even had me tell his friends where I got it from when they asked.<br /><br />*I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Great value, handy tool for troubleshooting code indications, recommend
B00HE1C146|5|Perfect. Popped old mirror out and popped this one in. Super simple.
B001C6LG3Q|5|works like a chap
B008M1WB7E|5|This is my second set of Husky Liners. Well worth the investment if you want to protect your carpet.
B005HJIV8M|5|A touch smaller than I felt it should be, but quite lovely.
B006GFLI0O|4|Its good!
B000CQFS0O|5|Good
B0081KNHOW|5|Works better than advertised!!
B00065L2D8|4|Works fine
B00KZP8A3O|5|This is a factory hose and fits perfectly without having to trim to fit. It has arrows to indicate the direction of flow. This hose should last many many years before replacing.
B004T39YX8|5|Great product. Works as advertised.
B005CLQ3RQ|5|Perfect match for our 2002 Toyota Tundra Limited- old handle busted. Easy replacement- much cheaper to do it yourself than take it in. A bit stiff to operate- but not a deal breaker.
B0045LN63S|5|This is exactly what I need to put in the Bushtec trailer I pull with my Harley.  Tucks right away and expands to a a nice emergency cone.  I recommend it if you need one.
B005NEMKBA|3|Rattles and comes loose. When it gets too low I have to tighten it all over again. Product needs to be developed more as it relates to the way it hangs on the seat. Velcro perhaps? 3 stars because it's still useable and was the cheapest tray I could find.
B000DLBSOS|5|Very good sandpaper. Long lasting.
B0002KKML0|3|If only the 9v battery would last longer than a week at a time... but it doesn't, and 9v batteries are a fortune. At the end of one year, you could have bought and installed a real alarm for what you spent on batteries!!
B000CO86EG|5|About 50 years ago, I bought one of these handy little bottle jacks, and I'd still be using it had it not been stolen during a household move. I don't recall the original price, but the current price is not far from what I suspect I paid then. This little baby works exactly the same way, with only a slightly different two-piece pump handle. I plan to keep this jack another 50 years, or pass it on to my kids!
B000CIQ5EA|5|I use it to pump fuel from my slip tank to my trucks filler neck.  Pumps a little more than 1 gallon/minute.  Very reliable, simple wiring, and fairly quiet.  Wish it had more flow and less pressure, but it was the highest flow with least amount of pressure that I could find.<br /><br />I would recommend this pump for this or similar uses.  Good value.  Pump has good weight to it which leads me to believe it is build well.
B0015PK3AG|5|good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015.
B004VRR9EI|5|Great product, easy to mount. Nice finish too, looks super. Great swing action, very powerful lift too.  Typical Reese product, the best !!
B00ODYO23A|2|They are not as bright as you see in the picture of the description. Yes, they look better than the original yellow ones, but I wish I knew they would still be pale and not bright.
B005GMALDS|5|Solid steering wheel.  Not flimsy at all.  Maybe not as strong as my Nardi, but much better than all the Ebay junk wheels.  Worth the money.
B000TYTSGE|5|Fits perfectly. Works great!
B002TMX2PM|3|Low quality
B00JGQLQ5M|5|As expected.
B0052KXYF6|4|Very hard to find outside of Amazon.  The price is very good.<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the plastic containers they come in are very cheap.  3 of the 12 quarts were leaking when they arrived.  They were leaking at the seam toward the top of the bottle.
B000GUPS8I|5|Excellent light weight cover
B00JIDU28K|5|Good quality item that went on easy
B00K35UEVM|1|This does not fit my 2003 BMW X5 as stated in the this fits your vehicle parts checker. Be sure to check the air conditioning line ports as one is bigger than the other and this one shipped with two of the same size.
B008EG65LU|5|Item arrived as described in the amount of time for PRIME subscriber. Item was shipped in large box than needed but I like that they protected the item from damage. Would recommend to anyone wanting a good price and great shipping procedures.
B009CLBL42|5|Nice
B001R93K0K|5|Very easy to apply. Looks great on my car.
B0054RFLOO|5|Worked perfectly on my 2015 limited.  I just have a small cargo box with brake lights/turn signal with the 4 pin connector.
B009304KLS|5|Perfect in every way. Fits my 2015 Altima's windshield exactly. No sun get thru side to side and top to bottom. Easy to install or remove. I roll it back up and store it in the boot. Seem like it will hold it's shape. Nice and rigid. Money well spent.
B000B68BX6|4|We bought this for our Honda Civic coupe 1999 and although it fits, we have to handle it with care cause the material it's made out of doesn't fee strong enough to withhold a strong grip. It's been a couple months since installed n it's working fine but the plastic just feel a bit cheap. Does the job though.
B000C83MKA|4|Good quality very happy with this product
B00R6RQ9B4|5|Fit perfectly to my volvo
B00FYIC2WW|5|Fast delievery & fits perfect
B004QQ721Y|4|Perfect size to flush and fill motorcycle brakes. You dont want to leave brake fluid laying around after opening it, used the whole bottle for front and rear brakes.
B003VAWLW6|1|Putty come folded over in half a roll stuck together. Creasing it narrow at the fold not good for sealing moulding but had to use to finish job or would have returned.
B009JREAEM|1|These do not fit on the 2003 Ford Explorer, the rear visors are too long and the fronts do not fit in the track. Returning for refund.
B00008RW9U|5|Classic
B004HH5VQK|5|Quality product
B00PJHYDPW|3|Was cracked badly when received. I contacted speedmotoco and they responded quickly but it is yet to be resolved. The housing of the light was also beginning to separate from the front silver ring. The light itself is bright and works well, but the glaring construction issues reduce the overall rating.
B00KNMKRU8|5|great charger
B007RRMVA6|5|Found this on AMAZON and even with prime was still cheaper then purchasing from the dealer. Exact match with the color of my car. Used to cover large scratch from road debris while driving on I-95 on the hood. Would suggest to anyone just use as directed.
B0031ZDU62|1|Did not fit like the oem part.
B00BMPFI6I|4|It is a bit heavy - this is a full size floor jack best moved around the shop on the wheels, but can be lifted by the front axle if required.
B00REQ1OJY|2|the front windows fit fine but bc of the angle of the back window once it rolls down or even if it's cracked the guard isn't the right shape to actually keep water from coming in the back windows.
B007JKPUUE|5|Perfect!  Use for my 2005 Accord and 2010 Odyssey.  OEM Honda product in original packaging.
B00D42AFS8|5|Portable.  Back up power source for electronic devices is a plus
B001XTS856|4|Nice alternative to a heavy jacket and still have some impact protection.
B0031ZDU62|5|Good deal!
B00030BFKG|5|Received them.
B007VDQXNM|5|Came fast an looks great
B002EWHUAU|5|Built well and effective
B00YE360TO|5|Thanks
B0009SS9CY|5|The fit and ease of installation was very good.  I recommend this item as a low cost solution to buying an entirely new cord for your RV.  Big cost savings
B00BITHBOU|5|Fit perfect, looked stock, fast shipping
B00032K4FG|5|Live in FL and love the incognito felling with this license plate cover not too dark and not too light perfect. Never been pulled over for it as well several unmarked cars , sheriff's , local police department been behind me and no problems love it.
B0017LWDN8|5|Great quality for the price.
B000C1MWAS|5|Good
B005LXTOHQ|5|Good
B004XONRGS|5|No complaints here.  This did exactly what I needed it to do and I have no complaints.
B005DMF3ZM|1|took only one week before the logo section became all scuffed up and looking terrible threw it in the trash. very disappointing!
B00KR5M52Y|4|Was just as expected and was delivered in a timely manner
B00BZR3O46|4|They look great! very bright , I just wish they could be adjusted a little bit better.
B00DUFC8ZM|5|Yes I was very satisfied with quality, size too. Three of my friends asked me where I got it and of course I told them.<br />It will be great this winter to preserve my new car from the winter elements, since it doesn't fit in my garage.
B00D8DR0AO|5|This works great!
B006M9VIRM|5|hard to get length cut if u pull a trailer have to calculate the truck drop when hooked to truck. could be a little wider but still nice setup
