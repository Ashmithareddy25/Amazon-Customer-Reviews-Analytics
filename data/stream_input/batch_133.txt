B00003CXBK|5.0|As a 20-year-old man, I often recall in fond remembrance my movie-viewing exploits as a young child.  In those days, I would watch such movies as the Wizard of Oz and Legend with such enraptured attention that it almost felt like the television screen was oozing with the magic depicted within those films.  It was a beautiful feeling to behold, and it is a feeling which I cherish very dearly as a memory from my more impressionable and innocent youth.  However, as time progressed, such a feeling would gradually dissipate along with my childhood.  I would no longer be enchanted by films that I had been so readily captivated with in my days as a young child.  Rather, I began to see such films (such as the Wizard of Oz) for what there truly were: simple children's films.  Legend had lost its fairy tale luster as well, as I view it moreso as a cheesy film than a movie of pure magic when I had seen it as a child.   Thus, I began to yearn for a film that would enchant me as an adult as much as I had been enchanted as a child by those aforementioned films.  And in the end, I found my answer in Princess Mononoke.  Mononoke is simply the best film I have ever seen in that it has rekindled those fond memories of me as a child beholding pure magic on the television screen once more.  The movie itself virtually oozes with a miraculously magical atmosphere, and is also a glaring commentary on the ambiguities of good and evil within the human soul, whether it be depicted within the industrially inclined Eboshi or the mystically vocal animal gods who struggle to maintain the balance of nature.  Coupled with stunning animation, art direction and a resoundingly haunting musical score, Princess Mononoke is a magical and riveting example of a true cinematic epic.  It is truly poetry in motion and a crime to dismiss as a mere cartoon.  Hayao Miyazaki truly is a master of his art, as his movie has truly reawakened the long silent child within all who have beheld his animated masterpieces,and Princess Mononoke is perhaps the very pinnacle of the history of cinema, animated or not.  Do not miss it.
0385473788|5.0|It doesn't surprise me that there are so many bad reviews for this book...However, many people don't understand the signifigance of it. I first read it when I was in eighth grade as a class project and hated every minute of it.  A couple of months ago I re-read it and for the first time was able to understand that while it isn't much of an entertaining book, it's historical importance is immeasurable. Unlike most books written on the Holocaust, this is written while it is taken place. You are allowed into the everyday life of two Jewish families while they are in hiding...Anne expresses her thoughts and emotions quite well considering her age and the fact that she wasn't an author. In my opinion, anyone interested in the Holocaust should add this book to their collection.

B00003CX8J|4.0|This Comic book to screen adaptation is one of the best of its type, well cast, well paced, and set up for its first sequel.<br />I haven't read an X Men comic in at least 25 years--since the 70's. Since then the comic books have become enormously popular, but I've not kept up or knew much about it at all.<br />I have fond memories of the clever, creative series and it quickly took the place of the mid 60's Superman, Batman, DC Gang comic books. But I grew out of comic books and I've not been overly nostalgic looking back at them. Oh sure I've wandered into comic book collector stores and peaked at a few old issues, stuff I remember having as a kid....<br />  X MEN<br />I'm sure not having a strong recollection of any story line and barely recalling some of the characters was a plus in my enjoying the 'surprises' of the film. I found the film wonderfully cast. Patrick Stewart makes a great Professor Xavier. Though Wolverine I understand is basically a dwarf in the comics, I don't think much is lost by having him full sized in the film. Ian McKellan plays a pretty old Magneto (but whow cares? he's having a good time and so are we).<br />They did a wonderful job with it I thought. At times the film was almost touching, and without slowing down the fast pace of its character introductions, plot mechanics or action.<br />Unfortunately, when you come to the end you realize the huge hurdle that any of these movies face. You want to end a movie like this, satisfying the audience but leaving them wanting a little more.<br />Of course there's no mystery about the wanting a little more part. The movie was done well, it will do good box office and so there will of course be a sequel. The lead actors have agreements in place to be in a couple of sequels, though director Singer isn't a sure thing. There will be another X Men movie,probably within a couple years. So the movie isn't exactly complete because unlike a movie where you aren't sure if there will be a sequel or not, you already know not only will the film  continue, it's already in several of the actors contracts. So they don't have to wrap everything up, they can have characters rush off to find themselves and not show us or tell us a thing about it, because there's gonna be a sequel.<br />I enjoyed the humor, the relationships, the special effects. The darker parts of the story I thought all were well balanced and the film didn't stop dead as we explored some disturbing revelations (as happened in the Batman films for instance). Because of the intelligent script and good acting the film isn't as shallow as most comic books to the screen conversions have been.<br />The film has some drawbacks. It was pretty much the Wolverine story, and several characters were given short shrift. Halle Berry was given almost nothing to do with her character of Storm. The reaction of the character to situations was also very slow. Berry's casting and performance may be the weakest thing about the film, but the script gave her so little to do it's impossible to determine if she would have been good were the part better written for her.<br />Some of the wire work stunt scenes were fairly obvious, but I much prefer this style of filmed stunts than CGI. I get a sense real people are doing the action scene and acrobatics at least part of the time, rather than most of it being computer generated.<br />It was a real drawback that we never see Cyclops and Jean interact as a couple to know how 'special' their relationship is. If we had, the triangle would have worked much better.<br />Bruce Davison who plays the Senator is usually very enjoyable in whatever he does, and he's quite good here and deserves a mention.<br />Bryan (Usual Suspects) Singer has directed one of the most  enjoyable, comic book movies I've ever seen and I anticipate many successful sequels (particularly if he agrees to direct another).<br />Now give me 80 or 90 mil, and a collection of Green Lantern books to refresh my memory and I'llturn it into a great 2 hour and 20 minute movie. C'mon...<br />Chris Jarmick, Author (The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder-a steamy cyber- thriller ...)tern books to refresh my memory and I'll turn it into a great 2 hour and 20 minute movie.

0684853523|5.0|If John Doe wrote a book on writing, six people would read it and five would find something to complain about. But this is Stephen King. He's going to tell us about the boys in the basement. He's going to take us on a trip through the creaking-door start up and into the shadows of plot and let us see how he gets those hairs jumping up off our neck.   And he does. It turns out to be by hard work, not by selling your soul to the devil. Writing, King says, is done by reading and by. . .well, writing. He tells us how, too, with examples from his own and others' work. Real examples. William Carlos Williams gets his due at last.    King could have told us he'd sold his soul and we'd believe him. In fact, we'd prefer to believe that than get down to work. And that's exactly why King did writers and readers alike a huge service when he wrote a non-fiction book on writing. It's just hard work. And hard work is worth it to writers because anything else except writing isn't worth getting up for. But it's lonely and scary. And King knows it; he's made the most of that fear and loneliness for us for more than 25 years.     If you want to make your living as a writer buy this book in hardcover, read it and keep it close at hand. When you think dusting/changing the oil on the car/cleaning windows is more important than writing 2,000 words today, crack open the book and read any two pages. You'll be a better writer for it.
6304698526|4.0|Steve McQueen became the American Anti-hero in Bullitt.  He wore the part very well, becoming Frank Bullitt, a police detective who was interested in doing the best job he could with least amount of politics and brown-nosing.  He could be trusted and he had been involved on several high profile cases which received media attention which resulted in the press and the public having a high opinion of him.  But he's just a cop doing his job. He's seen a little too much, and has a developed a thick skin.<br />The plot is a little difficult to follow because it's presented  entirely from Bullitt's perspective.  Therefore some of the major plot points are not emphasized and might slide by you un-noticed if you aren't playing Detective along with Bullitt.<br />The film is also somewhat leisurely paced from what most audiences are used to seeing.  It's the antithesis of a dumb action thriller--even though its a film famous for it's still hair-raising car chase which takes place mostly on the hilly streets of San Francisco.  And another thrilling chase scene on an airport runway.<br />In fact it was a film that was shot entirely on location and great attention has been taken to details.  The hospital scenes were actually shot in a wing of a hospital and real doctors and nurses played the doctors and nurses in the scene -- not actors.  Robert Vaughn magnificently plays the utterly untrustworthy and oily slick rich politician.  He's used to having people say yes to him and do exactly what he wants, when he wants it.  And he's also used to keeping his nose clean and being portrayed by the press as a squeaky clean, near perfect conservative politician.  He's requested Bullitt to keep a valuable mob informant safe from harm over the weekend, so he can present the informant to the Senate to testify. Vaughn is playing a dark Bobby Kennedy on a quest to grab headlines and political power by exposing the mob.<br />Bullitt accepts the assignment but notices right away that people have already been sloppy in choosing the room the informant is in, and other matters.  It's not a particularly hard assignment, and Bullitt is not overly concerned about it.  It's his job, no big deal.<br />However, the mob informant is acting rather strangely, and while another office is on watch duty, two hitmen enter the hotel room and blow away the informant and shoot the police officer.  The informant isn't quite dead yet and is rushed to the hospital.  When the officer tells Bullitt the informant let the people who shot them into the room, Bullitt realizes something is very fishy about the set-up.<br />Vaughn is of course furious and he will need a scape-goat to take the fall if his star witness can't testify.  That scapegoat is going to be Bullitt.<br />When the informant dies, Bullitt keeps his death a secret at first.  He wants to get to the bottom of things, not because he's worried about Vaughn but because its his job and maybe somehow Vaughn was involved with it also.<br />Robert Duvall pops up in the film as a taxi-driver.  Jacqueline Bissett looks beautiful as Bullitt's devoted girlfriend, who is worried his job is making him too cold, too tough and too distant.  Norman Fell is also quite good in a supporting role.<br />There is beautifully realized scene back at the crime scene, where  Bullitt is going over (in his mind) all of the information he has.  He is re-playing what may have happened in the room, seeing if there is some piece of information or piece of information he's over-looked.  There are several cuts in the scenes, showing us what Bullitt is looking at, how he is focusing intensely on solving this perplexing and high profile case. There is no music in the scene, and no dialogue.  It's a brilliant scene and one only a handful of directors today would have the power to keep it in their film.<br />Throughout Bullitt, you will notice how sound and particularly silence is used.  There's a great late 60's jazzy score by Lalo Schifrin (who is best known for his Mission Impossible theme), but there's also the sound of silence which is used very effectively in the film, and the sounds of late 60's automobiles racing through the streets of San Francisco.  Director Yates is a cameraman and editor himself, he knows how to make a sequence work to its fullest effect. In this film he used William A Fraker as his cinematographer who create a realistic yet smooth (as opposed to a rough documentary type)look for the film.  The film was written by Alan R. Trustman.  It was nominated for a Best Sound Oscar and won an Oscar for Best Editing.<br />This is one of the best performances Steve McQueen ever gave.  He gives the role the intensity and depth it warrants while still moving about as gracefully as a Panther.  Bullitt and Junior Bonner remain my favorite McQueen performances.<br />Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon  with Serena F. Holder - A steamy cyber thriller available January 2001.

B000003CMD|5.0|Eat a Peach is the best, but this is still 5-star perfection. How they pulled off the magic without Duane (and Barry Oakley for half of it!) will remain a mystery for eternity. Every song is a masterpiece, but Jessica alone makes it worth it! The Allman's last truly perfect recording.
B000021Y7X|5.0|In 1983, after months of meticulous planning and preparation, Jonathan (Melvin and Howard, Silence of the Lambs) Demme began filming three nights of ingeniously staged concerts at Hollywood's Pantages Theater. There had never been a concert film like this ever before. A film which would quickly be dubbed after it's 1984 release, one of the greatest rock movies ever made. It is but liking the Talking Heads is necessary to enjoy the film.<br />I guess you could say the Talking Heads began by combining elements of art school pop with punk, new wave, funk and even disco and then through subsequent albums explored musical elements (jazz, experimental, african,) from around the world integrating as much as they could into their music, while still retaining some of the awkwardness of their upper middle class white-ness. There had never been a band quite like this ever before, so it is fitting there's never been a film quite like this either.<br /> If you were to look at David Byrne (in the late 70's and 80's) you would think he was a Hollywood Casting agents' idea of a photogenic computer geek. If you talked to him, he would seem nervous, shy, and wound up much too tightly. To hear him sing, was like hearing a teenager trying to keep his voice from cracking, and when it did crack it would switch octaves and stay in tune as he continued to sing the song. He would make strange noises, he would find left handed ways to phrase his lyrics, around the beats while weaving it through the music accompanying him. The geekiness, the awkwardness, the shyness, the weirdness and the seemingly un-ending energy that David Byrne brought to his live performances (particularly in the 80's) was different from what most had ever seen before. He was forever challenging himself to come up with ever more interesting ways to entertain, amuse and serve up the rich music and smart lyrics that made up a Talking Head song. He wanted to be artistic, but not overly pretentious or inaccessible. He wanted to be weird and different, but not out of touch or overly serious.<br />Like the music itself, the film is layered. The opening image is of shadows and light on a concrete floor as credits appear over the image in complete silence. Then we see the shadow of the neck of an acoustical guitar on the floor, we hear the sounds of a crowd getting louder and louder. We see the feet of Byrne walking across the stage. He's wearing bright white canvas sneakers. He sets down a boom box on the floor. The crowd is  cheering.<br />&quot;Hi I got a tape I want to play,&quot; says the thin almost too delicate voice of Byrne. Then with a flick of a hand, the boom box if flipped on, and a loud beat begins. A single guitar chord is struck,and a nervous, man begins singing Psycho Killer. Not merely singing the song, but performing it from inside out on a bare stage, under a stark stage light.<br />And from there song by song the film slowly builds. Backdrops are rolled into place. Band members begin to join David on the stage. Lighting moods are established. Stage hands wheel out platforms, drums, keyboards, percussion. Backup singers join the band. They will eventually taunt David into awkwardly, imitating native African dancing. The music becomes richer and fuller. Slide projectors project huge words on a simple backdrops. Words which take on new meanings when presented in such a manner. We're treated to great performances of: Slippery People, Burning Down the House, Life During Wartime, Swamp and more. David's energy builds and builds until he is running around the stage like a marathon runner. He begins the concert as a stiff, uptight middle-class white guy by the time it is over he has lost his loses his stiffness, and let go of all of his inhibitions.<br />The music and lighting shifts from stark and simple, to complex. At times the mood gets ominous and dark. Witness the look that is attained for `What a Day it Was' in which the spirit of Edvard Munsch's The Scream seems to have been channeled into the concert. And then suddenly the stage becomes warm, and a vintage 50's/60's free standing floor lamp becomes the focal point for the warmest song David and the Talking Heads ever wrote, Naive Melody: This Must be the Place. David conjures up Fred Astaire in dancing a bit with the lamp at the end of the song.<br />These wonderful shifts in mood, created by lighting and camera angles aren't just the work of Demme and Byrne but also (the great, late) cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth. Jordan claims he likes this film and his work in it even more than his work in Blade Runner. That may be over-generous of him , but regardless what we as viewers take as simple, was quite a complex and a technical challenge to pull off. David leaves the stage for a few moments , and the Tom Tom Club (original T.H. band members' side band) takes over ( with their biggest hit Genius of Love -which Mariah Carey has now sampled into two hits). Then  suddenly David is back with his funny Big Suit. A suit three times bigger than he is, engineered to stay on his body. A suit that moves a few split seconds after he does creating a strange effect. A Japanese influenced costume which made the ordinary business suit look utterly ridiculous through a bit of exaggeration.<br />There's so much more to be savored and enjoyed from this film that I've only scratched the surface here.  The DVD is a wonderful package of material that includes odd interviews, story boards which let you see how Byrne's concept was realized by the film-makers and the songs that were deleted from the original theatrical film. The music (even 18 years later)still sounds fresh and innovative and the presentation remains the best concert film ever made.<br />  Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon  with Serena F.

630443796X|2.0|Did anyone but me notice that this movie stops being a comedy the moment Judy Benjamin defies her parents and decides to remain in the army?  From the very next scene through the conclusion, it becomes a deliberate feminist polemic and deliberately unfunny.  Feminism is nice, but filmmakers seem either afraid to have too much fun with it or unable to keep from aiming over the top.  (See Nine to Five and The Incredible Shrinking Woman for two other examples.)  Eileen Brennan's scene in which she first meets Benjamin is the high point and (unfortunately and needless to say) comes early.  As with Swing Shift, Hawn flexed her star muscles and did things her way -- to the detriment of the product and the audience.
0141802731|1.0|This latest novel shows none of the brilliance of Pillars of the Earth, none of the fascination of Dangerous Fortune, none of the history in A Place Called Freedom, none of the intrigue and sharpness found in Eye of the Needle, and none of the action in On Wings of Eagles. I can't believe it could be the same author of the aforementioned stories.  Even the editors dozed as they worked: neighbourhood, but favor. Follett borrows from Trevanian when using clothing to delineate characters: Bowler and Raincoat. For those who have read this book, How did Luke have his front door key with him in Huntsville when at no time had he found his own clothes, wallet or other, and none of his friends had given him a spare key? For me, this novel reflects the problem with large advances and small expectations for popular writers.  The author's grand smile on the back cover may just reflect his awareness that he has put one over on his publisher and his dedicated fans.
6300214710|2.0|[Spoiler alert.  Nothing overt, but I do touch on the ending indirectly.]<br />Burning questions for anyone who liked this movie:<br />Q. Why does Ringwald appear repulsed by Cryer the first time she sees him?<br />A. So that the audience can identify with her, even though it turns out they're best friends.<br />Q. Why does Ringwald's best friend disappear halfway through the movie?<br />A. Because the actress died.  But that's no reason to keep the scenes she shot, with no explanation of the character's disappearance, and then scribble new material for Annie Potts' record shop supervisor as the new best friend in the second half of the movie.<br />Q. Why does Spader look like he belongs in college, not high school?<br />A. Because he was clearly too old for the part, although he was otherwise perfect.<br />Q. Speaking of Spader, why has he been chasing Ringwald for years if nothing about people outside of his social status appeals to him?<br />A. Plot point Hughes thought he had to have, but it's actually unnecessary.<br />Q. Why are we supposed to think that Ringwald's perfectly decent house is trashy and shameful?<br />A. Because audiences would presumably be repulsed by genuine poverty.  (It's also a mystery why she's so ashamed of it if she rejects the values of her snobby classmates so vehemently.)<br />Q. Why in the novelization does Duckie get the leading lady and not in the movie?<br />A. Because the writer of the novelization knew what the only real logical ending was.  Hughes mistook gloss over substance again, as he did in &quot;The Breakfast Club,&quot; where Ally Sheedy's transformation from quirky indivualist to Barbie doll was supposed to be a good thing.<br />Q. Why, if the characters' emotions and actions are supposed to ring true, does Potts almost blind a customer with a staple gun?<br />A. Because cheap, easy laughs are excused by audiences raised on sitcoms and music videos.<br />Q. Why, if Cryer and Ringwald are in the same grade and therefore presumably the same age, can't he get into the same nightclub she can?<br />A. Don't ask me.<br />Q. Why is the father played by Stanton such a weakling?<br />A. It's required in any movie from the late 70s on where a child or teenager is the protagonist.  Has there been a parental figure in movies in the last 25 years as charming and authoritative as Ferris Bueller?<br />Q. Why would anyone hire an actor whose idea of emoting is to press his lips together and bulge his eyes out?<br />A. Ask Andrew McCarthy's agent.<br />Can I recommend anything about this movie?  Yes.  Cryer is genuinely appealing in his best role.  The soundtrack still kicks.  And the climax (moments before the ending itself falls apart, when you think the right thing is about to happen, before it doesn't) is genuinely touching, because Duckie deserves happiness and Andy deserves Duckie.presumably the same age, can't he get into the same nightclub she can?<br />A.

0783246641|5.0|this is the greatest movie I have ever seen, it is so brilliant that it boggles the mind. I cannot understand why no one can comprehend its sheer brilliance. You seriously have to pay attention to THE DIALOGUE... it totally explains the movie's ending... so put on the closed captioning, people! And you too will see the sheer brilliance of this movie. And remember as always... CHRISTIAN BALE IS GOD.
B00004U2HK|5.0|Is this my favorite movie?  No.  Top ten?  No.  Top thousand?  Nope.  But I always enjoy watching it when I come across it.  Robert Wise was no slouch; this is expert family filmmaking, funny and uplifting and even suspenseful.  Sure, it's supposedly based on fact even while we know that no family with this many kids of this many ages could possibly get along this well.  And sure, you can't expect complex moral dilemmas in a movie that posits, &quot;Nuns, singing, and children are good; Nazis are bad.&quot;  But no one approaches this movie without knowing what he or she is in for, and therefore I'd be amazed to find anyone who was genuinely disappointed by it.  Let's just be thankful there were never any sequels or prequels.  One is enough.
B00003CXE7|4.0|The movie's fantastic, but the DVD has far too much extra content... 4 hours of extra material for a 2 hour movie? I really wouldn't care if they had a movie-only version of it, but to charge so much (SRP) for Gladiator on DVD and then justifying it with all this added garbage (I'm sorry, but much of the extra material is just that) is frustrating.
B000003TA4|5.0|As a devout fan of sound in general, I have heard many types of music. I have heard many wonderful compositions from many talented and inspiring artists. I can honestly say, that this collection of relatively simple compositions speaks to me and moves me in a way that many wonderful artists have not been able. This music bleeds spirit, people. It seems to speak of a primal feeling that I'm sure everyone has experienced at one point in their life. It's the feeling of growing up, of change, and of the spiritual passage that everyone must go through. If what I'm saying isn't absolutely clear to you, then do yourself a favor and invest some time in this album. Listen to Kurdt Cobain pour his guts out to you, to expose his own spirit, to share with you his own spiritual passage. This album is genius. This isn't some fancy, calculated art rock. This is the human experience. This is culture.
0553208845|5.0|In the shade of a banyan tree, a grizzled ferryman sits listening to the river. Some say he's a  sage.<br />He was once a wandering shramana and, briefly, like thousands of others, he followed  Gotama the Buddha, enraptured by his sermons. But this man, Siddhartha, was not a follower of  any but his own soul. Born the son of a Brahmin, Siddhartha was blessed in appearance,  intelligence, and charisma. In order to find meaning in life, he discarded his promising future for  the life of a wandering ascetic. Still, true happiness evaded him.<br />Then a life of pleasure and  titillation merely eroded away his spiritual gains until he was just like all the other &quot;child people,&quot;  dragged around by his desires. Like Hermann Hesse's other creations of struggling young men,  Siddhartha has a good dose of European angst and stubborn individualism. His final epiphany  challenges both the Buddhist and the Hindu ideals of enlightenment. Neither a practitioner nor a  devotee, neither meditating nor reciting, Siddhartha comes to blend in with the world, resonating  with the rhythms of nature, bending the reader's ear down to hear answers from the river.<br />In  this translation Sherab Chodzin Kohn captures the slow, spare lyricism of Siddhartha's search,  putting her version on par with Hilda Rosner's standard edition
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Finally, a CD with all the great #1 hits from one of the most legendary bands in history, The Beatles!! There can't be many other bands with 27 #1 hits, and these weren't at #1 for no reason! These are all great songs! I liked this album because the songs all have great music, cool lyrics and fun beats. Some of the best songs on the album are Penny Lane, She Loves You, Hello-Goodbye, Something, Hey Jude and the list goes on and on and on. This is one of the best albums of the year, and I recommend it to absolutely everybody who wants all of The Beatles extraordinary #1 hits! You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Beyond the movie, this DVD offers a TLC documentary, behind-the-scenes, and &quot;cutting room floor&quot; extras that make it an outstanding value.  Even if you thought the movie was just so-so, buy this DVD.
B000003CKH|5.0|Yes, I strongly dislike &quot;pop&quot; music. By &quot;pop&quot; I mean things that are heard on the radio and are under about 6 minutes long. I listen to mostly classical, jazz, and what is now labeled &quot;post-rock&quot;. However, Fashion Nugget is wonderful. I respect Cake, and this is, in my humble and non-judgemental opinion, their best CD. The music is simple and fun. Even without the horn, this would still be a great CD. The songs have similar chord progressions (hence the &quot;flow&quot; mentioned in a review below). Lots of 7th chords and tons of things are in E minor. That, to me, makes some music worth listening. Some good old drums, bass, and some dirty guitar, not to mention the wonderful vocal style. Great stuff to solo to and great stuff to listen to when you don't feel like listening to good music.
B00003CXDG|3.0|I rented the disc and won't play on my Philips DVD850AT player.  I tried on the famous Apex 600A, it worked!  While the DVD 850AT (that has a Dolby digital decorder built-in) was made in Japan and cost nearly 3 times more than the Apex 600A.  I never have any problem with neither players, this is the first time I have trouble with a DVD disc that won't play in my player.  I believe a lot of people will face the same problem that I had, because that Philips DVD player was made by Toshiba, as far as I know.  <br />I think these DVD asso. people are stupid enough to put region code on it and now, they are doing some even more stupid trying to get some new standard out that won't down competible to the original standard! <br />The sound quality of this movie is good, the picture quality is the worst I have seen among all 40 + movies I have seen (at work and home).  The story is far worse than the original Mission Impossible movie.
B00004X01U|5.0|After I bought Ray Of Light 2 years back, I have a lot more interest in the music of Madonna. Her talent to release new/quality music each time, impresses me.<br />Music has very much to offer. There are songs with influences from the disco era in the 70's, like the titlesong. There are  folky songs with some electronica, I Deserve It, Gone, and the pretty good ballad What It Feels Like For A Girl. Amazing has  indeed pretty much incommon with Beautiful Stranger, but it's still a very likeable tune. Don't Tell Me is a very good choice to release as a single, with the incomplete sounding beginning. There are also 2 songs that are heavily influenced with electronics, Nobody's Perfect and Paradise (Not For Me). They both have pretty deep lyrics, just beautiful. Some say that electronic music doesn't have emotion, Madonna proves that it can be possible. There is a bonus track on the European version of Music, American Pie. It's kind of quirky, but it's really one of the better coversongs I have ever heard. For over more then 15 years, Madonna is one of the most influenced icons in the pop industry, and because of that you can see who the great artists are and who the hype. (Yes, I mean all the Britney and Spiceclones.) I really dont have any favourite song. They are all very good in there own way.
0679879269|5.0|i was introduced unintentionally to this searies four years ago by my mum. i was going on a trip with my dad and we were at the library taking out tapes to listen to on the journey. one of the tapes was the golden compass, the first in the series. irefused to listen to it for a long time, because i didn't want to hear about the experiments being preformed on the children were:but when i listened to it i loved it.   I anxiously awaited the publication of the next book, the subtle knife, and i got it for a christmas present. It was just as good as the first, the only dissapointing thing about this was the agonizingly long wait for the next book.  Now, after a greulling three year wait I have got and read the book. it is worth the wait, to use a cliche. The plot was fabulous, the charectars original, and the ending an excellent finish to he series. Amoung my favorite charectars is the unfathomable Mrs Colter, the cynical angel Baruch, Dr. Mary Malone and most of all the incorrigable Lyra. i thought this series to  be one of the best things i have ever read, and Phillip Pullman is my favorite author. Who else has the guts to cast god as the villian in a book.
B000051VWW|3.0|It was just that OK I like only three tracks on the CD.... I guess I am not a very depressed type of person.... Well I also think that the music could have been more clear on the CD ... It was OK but thinking back I wish I had bought another CD..
B000002JS6|4.0|Masters of consistent 4/4 sleaze rock are at the prime with this outstanding hard rock album. Many, if not all, of the tunes are extremely catchy (though it's difficult not to be catchy when you play nothing more than basic chords on all major scales), which adds to the album's replay value as well as the listener's overall enjoyment of the work. AC/DC's presentation has never been too impressive, and the same can be attributed here. But for some good, sleazey fun, check it out! This especially goes for you newer kids who have little knowledge of 70's/early 80's hard rock.
6305922756|5.0|...There's a reviewer down the way who calls him/herself, THE CRITIC - Ignore them! If you find Spinal Tap stupid, you're just not smart enough to get it! There's so much to love about this movie! The writing is fantastic, both in the mock-rock songs and the script. The characters are so memorable and endearing, that it's impossible to choose my favorite - bottom line: OWN THIS FILM! If you like rock n roll and great satire (aren't they one and the same?), there's never been a better way to laugh with at it and with it.
B000002ADT|5.0|Pure and majestic throughout the album's length, &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot; is the most beautiful recording I have ever heard. Wonderous and extraordinary, dynamic and heartfelt. . . I'll end here, in fear that any further words would discredit such a fine album. <br />Get it now.
0380715430|4.0|You know who you are.  You savor the words &quot;onomatopoeia&quot; and &quot;clerihew,&quot; a well written thesaurus is as good to you as any bestseller, and your copy of the OED is so well used that even the pages for the letter X are beginning to wear.  You, friends, are the word people.  Your love of the English language should be (if it already isn't) legendary, and Bill Bryson applauds such interest in his book &quot;The Mother Tongue.&quot;  He takes you through the ins and outs of our native language, from its Celtic beginnings through the Norman conquest and the Americanization of the world.  While certain facts seem a bit out of place, and others seem downright weird, the feel of this book is what is its main attraction.  This book is a portable copy of that doddery old English professor who made the language come to life for you in college, or perhaps the fresh-faced teacher you had in high school.  Its informal tone lets you recognize, but forgive, its mistakes, and allows you to immerse yourself in one of the best of things: English.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|&quot;1&quot;, being the definitive Beatles &quot;best-of&quot; compilation, is a pure masterpiece for the rock 'n roll genre and beyond. This album is thorough, featuring all of their #1 hits during their existence, and it is proof alone that The Beatles are the greatest rock outfit of all time. Sure, there's nothing overtly spectacular about their musicianship skills, but they conquered the throne first. Presenting their material flawlessly, upholding dominant melodic layering, &quot;1&quot; is a must-own compact disc!
0316779237|3.0|... but the rest of the stories disappoint. The first story, Santaland Diaries, is a classic. I have rarely, if ever, laughed so hard at a short story. It is a true, though possibly embellished, story of the author and his experiences as a professional elf in a mall during the holiday season. As I said, this story alone is worth the cost of the book.<br />Sadly, the rest of the stories don't even come close to measuring up. They are all cynical holiday season fare but very uninspired. My high hopes after reading Santaland Diaries were dashed.
630512695X|5.0|When I first rented this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I mean, come on! A movie made in the 1950s is not the typical movie people watch nowadays- I figured it would look very old. Wrong! This is a spectacular movie, and I mean spectacular! The story is about an acting duo, like Astaire and Rodgers, however, movies did not have sound. However, when the movie industry discovered how to use sound, the girl in the duo has a piercing voice and could not possibly be in a movie with sound. Meanwhile, the man, portrayed by Gene Kelly, meets and falls in love with a rising actress, and she does a voice over for KElly's awful and devious partner. This is by far not the best description of this movie. Anyway, this movie is fantastic, the music is great, the acting is superb, and buying this package is a great idea, because not only can you listen to the soundtrack whenever you feel like it, but since I know you will want to watch this movie more than once, you can own it and watch it when ever you feel compelled to do so.
6304925131|3.0|Although the premise was of interest, the movie did not deliver. There were some memorable quotes, though.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This album is moderately priced so it's a good buy for younger people with much less money. Adults who are starting to get into The Beatles should be ashamed of themselves if they buy this album before the Red, and Blue best of albums. It's The Beatles I don't have to sell these songs to you, it be tougher if it was crap like Limp Bizkit. Most hardcore fans like myself are dissapointed that A Day in the Life, Helter Skelter, Strawberry Fields, Good Day Sunshine, and a million others aren't on here but that's life!
6303965415|5.0|This is my favorite Jane Austen adaptation.  It is quiet and meaningfully paced to enjoy the atmosphere of Austen's 18th Century England.  As a huge anglophile I have seen Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds in several similar tv/movie productions.  They are superb in these roles. The story is quite faithful to the book.  The characters are true and lively to watch.  I recommend to all romance / british drama lovers everywhere.
0671034065|5.0|I thought this was a great book.  I did figure out who the killer was before the end, but still enjoyed reading the climax.<br />This is definitely more of a &quot;hot and heavy&quot; romance then a &quot;candy and flowers&quot;.  I enjoyed this as many authors are not as good at this as Linda Howard.  I sat back and enjoyed the ride.  It was fun and entertaining.  Many others who wrote reviews thought the romance happened too fast, that they hated each other.  I agree with the addage that there is a fine line between love and hate.  Besides, most romance novels are improbable.  <br />If you are looking for an escape, this may be it.  Don't over analize.... just enjoy the fantasy!
6302719631|2.0|I received this video as a Christmas gift and was excited to see the one Jane Austen adaptation I had yet to see. It was poorly acted and surprising ill cast for a BBC production. I could not believe that the characters fell in love, because the dialogue was very stiff, and the acting even stiffer.  Please read the book instead of taking this poor shortcut of a movie.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This guy Eminem, he's the man of the minute, yet it seems that every 1 hates him yet they love his music.........In my case I think him and his music are both brilliant.As a true fan of Shady's I can honestly tell all true rap fans this is the absolute bomb!! If u aint into rap buy it, listen to his words, he may swear but atleast it's individual work.......A thing that u will notice is many sound effects in the background when he sings, LISTEN UP!! Every song has it's own meanin!! Later Eminem!! ...ND to the DUMB motherfuckers who think EMINEM IS THE BEST RAPPER OF ALL-TIME, LISTEN TO HIP-HOP FROM THE EARLY 80'S TO NOW, AND MOST FOR THE RAPPERS IN HISTORY AND THEN U DUMB MOTHERFUCKING WHITE PEOPLE MAKE A JUDGEMENT ON THE BEST RAPPER OF ALL-TIME. plus EMINEM DISSING NSYNC and people like that I want to see him diss some REAL-THUG ASS RAPPERS, HE PROBALY GET HE'S BITCH ASS KICKED. because he's bitch ass IS NOT NO THUG. more artlessly, say it was all meant to be a joke, a big, knee slapping  joke and that those who are disgusted or offended or saddened by all of  this vulgarity, lack of civility and lowlife antics need to get a sense of  humour. Well, the joke will soon be on Eminem - the chances are against  this punk surviving and not becoming another statistic in the rap star hall  of early deaths. There is no way that anyone who thinks and acts like this  can maneuver their way through adulthood successfully. Enjoy it while you  can Eminem. It - and you- won't last.
079213690X|5.0|This movie was very gory.  But I think all that blood tought me that people were crazy back in that time.  It was sad at the end but the whole movie was excellent.  I have always been interested in that time and Braveheart showed every thing there was to know about that time.
0804106304|5.0|I had heard a lot of criticism from friends I made online regards it's negative portrayal of Asian males. I didn't find it to be the case (and I'm an Asian male too).

0790738074|5.0|Professor Harold Hill (Robert Preston) arrives in River City with a plan to make some money from the gullible citizens. He tells them he is organising a River City Boys Band with the intention of leaving town with their money before the instruments arrive. He hasn't allowed for the fact that he will meet beautiful librarian Marian Paroo (Shirley Jones) and fall for her charms. Marian is at first very suspicious of Hill and then begins to realise he is doing a lot of good things for River City. Hill changes his plan, decides to stay and against all the odds manages to form the boy's band.<br /><br />A high class supporting cast includes Buddy Hackett, Paul Ford (who played the wonderful Colonel Hall in the \\"Sergeant Bilko\\" TV series), Hermoine Gingold, a very young Ron Howard (only eight years old at the time), Harry Hickox, Percy Helton, Max Showalter and Pert Kelton. The film contained so many outstanding characters expertly portrayed it is difficult to know where to start. Robert Preston of course was ideally cast as Harold Hill - it was the best role of his career and the one he is most fondly remembered for. He worked really hard, put his songs over with style and verve, was full of energy, and seemed to be enjoying himself enormously. The delightful Shirley Jones gave another captivating performance as Marian the librarian and sang several engaging songs throughout the film. Paul Ford was brilliant as Mayor Shinn and had many comic moments trying to have Hill run out of town or sent to jail. Buddy Hackett as Hill's friend Marcellus gets involved with the phoney plan to form the band and does his best to keep Hill out of trouble. Ron Howard impresses with his featured number \\"Gary, Indiana\\" (which for the sake of the plot he had to sing with a lisp!). Two of my favourite character actors (Percy Helton and Max Showalter) were in the film but only appeared briefly in the opening number which was a shame as I would have preferred to see them do more. (Max Showalter was previously known as Casey Adams and had appeared with Marilyn Monroe in \\"Niagara\\" and \\"Bus Stop\\" plus many other films). The \\"Buffalo Bills\\" barbershop quartet close harmony team sing some nostalgic numbers which are very enjoyable and helped to establish the period atmosphere of the film. Director Morton Da Costa introduced the gimmick of having the screen go dark after several of the musical numbers which I thought was a clever innovation.<br /><br />Some favourite lines from the film:<br /><br />Robert Preston (to Buddy Hackett): \\"Must create a desperate need in your town for a boy's band\\".<br /><br />Shirley Jones (to Paul Ford): \\"Honestly, a bunch of grown men. Along comes this fly by night salesman and you're all taken in!\\".<br /><br />Paul Ford: \\"I want that man's credentials\\".<br /><br />Jones (to Preston): \\"The one thing one must remember no matter who one is or what one is working for one can do anything if one puts one's mind to it!\\".<br /><br />Preston (to Jones and Ron Howard): \\"Well, for the first time in my life - I got my foot caught in the door\\".<br /><br />Songs include \\"You've Got Trouble Right Here in River City\\", \\"The Sadder but Wiser Girl for Me\\", \\"Till There Was You\\", \\"Goodnight my Someone\\", \\"Wells Fargo Wagon\\", \\"Marian the Librarian\\" and of course the big show stopper \\"Seventy Six Trombones\\".<br /><br />\\"The Music Man\\" was definitely one of the best musicals of the sixties and can be seen over and over again with increasing pleasure.

6302814359|3.0|Much like &quot;Gremlins 2&quot;, this sequel focused on more of the comedic aspects of zombie films so naturally it was a &quot;hit-or-miss&quot; proposition.Coming back to the film were the 2 hapless goons who caused all the problems in part 1 but they play different characters.Part 1 used the right amount of humor to balance out the gore but this film overdid it. If you're a pure horror fan, you'd do well to avoid this and stick with parts 1 &amp; 3. (I can't forgive them of the hokey &quot;Thriller&quot; zombie at the end...way too stupid.)However, if you're a fan of all 3 films, you know that none are available on DVD. You must write to the companes who own the films and ask for them on the DVD format.MGM owns the home video rights to part one. If you want it on DVD then write to them at;MGM Home Entertainment,2500 Broadway,Santa Monica, CA 90404-3061.Warner Brothers owns part 2, write to them at;Warner Home Video,4000 Warner Blvd.,Burbank, CA 91522,Trimark owns part 3. I have yet to track down their snail-mail address so I can only provide their email address. Write to them at;feedback@trimarkpictures.com.
B00003CX8J|4.0|Marvel Comics have had a hard time of late getting their comic creations in film in such a fashion that the product doesn't look cheesy or lame. All too often the projects are either shuttled to TV (The Incredible Hulk), go right to video (Captain America) or are so bad that they aren't released at all (Fantastic Four). X-MEN, however, doesn't suffer from this Marvel jinx, and proves to be a solid, fun, and action packed film that is very enjoyable. The cast is very solid with Hugh Jackman's sullen Wolverine and Anna Paquin's conflicted Rogue leading the pack. Their moments together help provide this film with its heart and soul. Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor X, while Ian MacKellan is an almost sympathetic Magneto. Famke Janssen is very solid as Jean Grey. At a brisk 90 minutes or so, this movie flys by and never sags in holding our interest. If you enjoy the comic, or just super hero adventures, I would highly recommend this film.
0345403959|4.0|This book is really only for those that have already read the Belgariad and Mallorian series.  It tells the tale of the Great Belgarath from thief to &quot;holy man&quot;.  It really isn´t an exiting read but it´s well writen and the plot (if you can call it that) is well laid out, but lacks any punch.  It has the thinks that always bothers me in all of Eddings work and that is repetativnes, same jokes and characters tend to say the same thing (if somebody says a word that doesn´t exist then the others always say something like &quot;Gee I wish I could make upp word like that&quot; and so on). I wish that he could think of new dialogs.  Theres nothing new or original in this book but some times it´s good to read a tried and tested formula specialy when it involves some of ones favorite fictional charachters.<br />If you have already read Eddings other works then this is a must, if not the give it a miss..
0780631684|4.0|Mix equal parts of Milton Bradley's Mousetrap, kerosene, and teenage angst. Stir. Light.<br />  This light snack doesn't have the satisfying satirical flavor of the Scream Trilogy, but it is a passable  tongue-in-cheek thriller. The glued-on, disjoint ending, however, leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.
B000050FEN|5.0|In 1995, Director David Fincher joined Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in the years most disgusting, tense and talked about films.  Seven is a look into a persons liking for gore and blood, all done through the theme of the 7 deadly sins.  Unlike Fight Club, another Fincher film, Seven was made right before the DVD format was introduced.  The initial release of Seven on DVD was less then spectacular.  The New Line Platinum series is visually one of the most stunning releases to come along in a while.  Sonically, this release will surround you with sound elements of such clarity and depth, it may seem too real at times.  The 2 disc package is similar to the Fight Club package.  It has two nicely designed discs in an attractive package.  The menu design on the discs are very impressive.  What may seem confusing at first becomes quickly understandable and easy to navigate throughout. Disc 1 has the movie along with commentary by David Fincher, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.  It also has commentary by the Screenwriter, the Editor, a Professor of Film Studies and the new Line President of Production.  These commentaries are very insightful, informative and entertaining to listen to.  The scene selections are nice, shown with still pictures and a title of each sequence.  Disc 1 also has a simple 'color bars' setup.  Picture quality of this movie is outstanding to say the least, especially if you compare this release with the previous DVD release.  The original negative was used this time, and the darkness of this film has never looked so incredibly clear. Contrast and colors are beautiful...not too saturated for this type of film, but quite stunning.  Sharpness is well executed throughout the film and I found it hard to see any grain or dirt on the picture. This is obviously a first class transfer and the anamorphic widescreen picture is superb.  Sound quality is even more amazing.  When you go to your setup in the menu, you have a choice of English or French subtitles.  Youalso have a choice of stereo Surround Sound, Dolby EX Surround Sound or DTS ES Surround Sound.  Whatever type of system you have, this film shines.  If you have a surround system with a great subwoofer, you will not believe your ears.  This film has been rebuilt from the ground up and remixed for DVD.  Effects elements and atmospheric sound effects will simply blow your mind.  Dialogue is clean and clear.  The sound department responsible for this soundtrack should be applauded.  They did a superb job.  Disc 2 has a bunch of extras that will keep you busy for quite a while.  The first extra on the disc is an &quot;exploration of the opening title sequence.&quot; You get to choose from different angles and different audio options while watching this sequence.  You can watch an early storyboard drawing of the title sequence, a rough version of the opening and the final version of the opening title sequence.  You can choose from a surround mix, a Dolby EX mix that was made just for this DVD, or a high quality 24bit/96Khz stereo mix.  It's amazing how many options you get to pick from just to watch something about the opening title sequence!  You can also listen to commentary by designer Kyle Cooper or the Sound Engineers Brent Biles and Robert Margouleff.  Wow!  The next pick on Disc 2 is where you get to see &quot;Deleted Scenes&quot; and &quot;Extended Takes&quot; from the film, all with or without David Finchers commentary.  There are seven scenes to choose from and are all fascinating to watch while listening to the commentary.  The next pick on Disc 2 are the &quot;Alternate Endings.&quot; You have your choice of the original &quot;test&quot; ending with or without David Finchers commentary.  You also can look at an animated storyboard of an unshot ending.  This was done really well and both offer subtle differences and insight into the ending that is in the film.  Next, you can look at a bunch of Production Design stills with commentary.  This was also done verywell, considering how amazing the Production Design really is for this film.  You next have choices of a bunch of other still photographs from the film, including John Doe's photographs, Victor's decomposition, police crime scene photographs and production photographs.  These come all with commentary, and this is the first disc where I actually enjoyed still photos on a DVD....very well done.  Another choice you have on Disc 2 is called 'The Notebooks.&quot; This is a very informative sequence of stills with commentary on how those infamous notebooks were created.  When you choose &quot;Promotional Materials,&quot; you can watch the theatrical EPK or the movie trailer.  As with most DVD's, you can choose &quot;Filmographies&quot; where you can see the resume's of all the actors and many crew members.  Finally, for all you technical people out there, you can choose &quot;Mastering for the Home Theatre.&quot; This is a fantastic look into the film to video transfer of Seven, as well as the color correcting, telecine, audio mastering and mixing of Seven for the theatre as well as the remixing for the DVD.  All are played with scenes from the film comparing the last release and this release of Seven.  The commentary is both educational and entertaining to listen to.  In conclusion, Seven is a must have DVD.  Picture quality is outstanding.  Audio quality is fantastic, and the extras are wonderful.  If you loved Seven in the movies, or want to replace your old DVD release with this one, buy Seven and prepare yourself for 2 hours of amazement.  If you are a lover of crime thrillers then get this disc. If you enjoy Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt or David Fincher then get this disc.  It would be a sin NOT to get this DVD! Enjoy!
6303029027|5.0|This film is an underrated gem. If you're looking for a bloodbath mobster movie, this is not it. A Bronx Tale is a movie with heart--and it just so happens to be about mobsters. <br />Kudos to Robert De Niro on his directorial debut (may he direct many more movies). He did an outstanding job of presenting a slice of life in the Bronx of the 1960s. Though his role as Lorenzo Aiello is rather small, its effect is felt profoundly throughout the movie as Lorenzo's son Calogero struggles between right and wrong. Lorenzo, representing the upstanding, hardworking Everyman, wants the best for his son and doesn't want him to choose life with the mob. Sonny, the neighborhood mob boss, also wants what's best for Calogero, or C, as he nicknames him. The moment in the film where this struggle is most keenly felt is when Lorenzo and Calogero are at the boxing match sitting in the &quot;nosebleed&quot; section. One of Sonny's henchmen invites Lorenzo and Calogero down front at ringside, but Lorenzo declines the offer. You can see how hard it is for Calogero to refuse those seats. But he is torn by the love he feels for his father, and wanting to be ringside with Sonny. The most poignant moment is when he apologizes to his father for wanting to sit with Sonny and tells Lorenzo that he appreciates his seat, though it's far away from the ring.<br />Another interesting, though more subtle, aspect of the movie was how Rosina, Lorenzo's wife, questioned Lorenzo's refusal to get involved with Sonny. You could see that she wanted a better life than the wife of a bus driver, and she didn't seem to be too concerned with how it was achieved. That would have been an interesting angle to explore, but the movie didn't suffer because it wasn't explored.<br />The element of racial tension and the inclusion of an interracial romance for C gave A Bronx Tale a more gritty feel. It wasn't hard to boo C's knuckleheaded friends as they harrassed blacks who passed through &quot;their&quot; neighborhood.The romance between Jane and C was tastefully done, and the actors who played the roles gave authenticity to the sweet, awkward relationship. Remember Sonny's door test? Well, I was practically praying and crossing my fingers that Jane would unlock that door!<br />But the film belonged to Francis Capra (young Calogero) and Chazz Palminteri (Sonny). The nine-year-old Capra was so convincing as a child who was perplexed by the difference between good and bad and all the gray areas in between. Palminteri really shines as Sonny, the suave but dangerous hood. The film is based on his childhood, and I think he did a wonderful job (along with De Niro) of bringing the story to the screen. Useless bit of trivia I read on another site: Palminteri's real name is Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri.
0062502182|4.0|It is truly an amazing book that captivates my full attention to it, even in middle of the night.  It is highly inspirational with aplenty of good &quot;life's learning lessons&quot; as I would describe it!<br />Its about a boy, who learns the art of listening (or rather feeling) the Language of the World.<br />No doubt the book is an excellent buy, but the ending left me dumbfounded.  It took a star away.  It's up to you to decide.<br />For if its your destiny, the whole universe will conspires in helping you to attain it!
B00003CXB6|2.0|It's hard to believe it's been 25 years since \\"Jurassic Park\\" thrilled moviegoers with its uncanny computer generated imagery of the Rolling Stones tour.  Keith, Mick, Charlie and Ron never looked so photorealistically decrepit!  In \\"Lost World,\\" the sequel, once again Jeff Goldblum emerges from either a Buddhist monastery in Thailand, or his failed relationship with Gina Davis to battle septugenarian rockers for dominance of VH1's playlist.<BR><BR>It seems the foxy old man (Richard Attenborough) responsible for killing everyone in the first flick has yet another island full of dinosaur rockers for Goldblum to crack wise about in that weird Goldblumian stammer.  Who will Goldblum face this time?  The Swinging Medallions?  Steppenwolf, featuring the original replacements for the guys who quit or died, and not their own replacements?  A Cher so cunningly lifelike she makes the Hall of Presidents at Disney World seem almost robotic by comparison?<BR><BR>Instead, our hero battles a gargantuan recreation of Brian Wilson, a truly stupendous achievement by the ILM effects wizards.  Especially when a team of renegade hunters dino-nap Wilson back to San Diego and he goes wild in the streets, frightening offensively stereotyped Japanese tourists and destroying all semblance of himself as a musical genius, all the while suing Dr. Eugene Landy for brainwashing him into this mess in the first place.<BR><BR>Will Goldblum avoid Wilson's shambling about while muttering and romance co-star Julianne Moore while saving his angry-yet-cute daughter who only wants her estranged father to watch her perform gymnastics?  Will Vince Vaughn survive to collaborate with Jon Favreau again?  And what lurks in the tall grass?  Oh no!  A pack of cloned Gary Glitters!  They'll devour everyone!<BR><BR>The DVD features not only the movie, but a lot of fascinating stuff about how they made the movie.  You know... like every other DVD where the movie is only interesting from a techno standpoint and theytry to convince you all their sweat and computer geekery was worth it.

B00004XPP0|2.0|Well, the only reason for Lucas to re release these movies is obviously the teaser for Star Wars Episode II: As Yet Untitled.  This is a big disappointment.  There is no new footage or anything worth watching.  We just hear from George that the new movie with have to do with the Rebuplic, and the mysterious clone wars.   If you already own the trilogy,  there really is no reason to buy it again.  Why not release these movies on DVD?  The official position from Lucasfilm is that George doesn't have the time to do the movies on DVD.  Does he print them himself in his garage.  This is just another example of Lucas milking it.  And I doubt this will be the last release of the Star Wars trilogy on VHS.
6305718903|3.0|I don't know what I thought of this movie. It was kind of complicated if you ask me. They tried to fit too many plots into one movie, and it didn't really come together like it should have. I mean, now that I think of it, I really did not care about any of the characters either. They just weren't that convincing. For what it was, it was good. One things for sure though...it was not scary at all. Disturbing, but not scary. It tried to be &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in every way possible. It wasn't really accurate either. Someone who does not believe in God cannot recive the stigmata. It is a gift for very religious people. Plus, who ever heard of a priest that went out to disprove miracles? There are reasons that I gave this one five stars. I liked the wild cinematography and the special effects. I guess that was it, really. <br />Rent it and see what you think. Should raise alot of controversy among Catholics.

B00004XOWM|4.0|Ok, Limp Has gone like a graph, the were amazing with thier first cd, then they went a bit down hill with thier second, but now they've come back up (though not as high as before) with this one.  Low points on this album are any of the songs that are rap (rollin' remix, getcha groove on)  while I have limited rescpect for some old school rappers (N.W.A.) this is pure sell out material, and one thing I hate is a sell out.  Then there's My Generation, well, well, well, this song is hardely worth listening to, the music is brilliant, but Fred Durst totally kills it with his talking about how LB is so great, I suppose a die hard could say that it's about disregarded teens, but that's just a cover up.  Same thing with Rollin', though it is better than My generation.  Another thing about this cd is the title, it's so stupid. Anyway, on to the highlights.<br />Good things about this album are the songs where he talkes about cool stuff, like in Full Nelson, where he talks about some guy who keeps making fun of him, so Fred is going to beat him up.  Or maybe Take a Look Around, which is probably thier second best song ever (second to Nookie) saying how everyone hates everyone else (I think it's about racisim, but I could be wrong) There are some emotionas songs on this album (no names comming to mind at the moment, sorry), but basicly Limp is like a mainstream version of a bunch of other bands.<br />If you want extreem politcal activisim, go for Rage Agianst the Machine, fif you want lot's of emotion, go for Korn, Staind, or Nine Inch Nails (I don't know where Fred get's off making fun them), or Finger 11, If you want lot's of skill with the instruments, go for Metallica, or any of the other bands here. But if you want a big mix of them all, and one that'[s a bit more mainstream, go for Limp Bizkit.
B00003CWTH|3.0|I agree totally with the reviewer from Grapevine, Texas. The first 10 minutes or so were very intriguing, literally pulling and drawing me into the film. I thought I was in for something very special. The film is constructed in the same manner as &quot;Resevoir Dogs&quot; is put together, many stories running succinctly and intercut with one another. Just when you forget about a character and their situation, boom, there they are. The acting is first rate, even though watching Jason Robards die on screen was heartbreaking. I did find the movie dragging on a bit after the second hour. I was awating a climactic ending, along the lines of &quot;The Game&quot;. But sadly, the film never delivers. The ending is one of the biggest letdowns I have had in film in quite awhile. The ending is so proposterous and contrived that you have to wonder what the writer was thinking about, or smoking, while he/she was writing it? Worth a few bucks to rent if only for the directing and acting. But don't waste your money if you are considering purchasing it.
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd blew me away.  The band is so brutally emotional, that the music grips you like other bands doesnt.  The instrumentation is excellent as well, you can tell the every single member of the band is excellent, right down to the DJ, who's scratches on Forgotten are phenomenly cool sounding, there is no week link.  Believe me, One Step Closer is the number one song because it has a wider appeal, I bought the cd for that song, and was initially worried that it might be another album slapped together around 1 song, this is NOT the case.  After hearing some of the other songs, I completely forgot about One Step closer, In the end, and By Myself blew me away.  There is no band like this, they took a proven recipe, and multiplied it x100.  Every song on the album is so emotion filled (not screaming f' the world emotion either), and so well thought out, it still hasnt gotten old, A MUST BUY for anyone who enjoys rock, rap-rock, or maybe even rap.
0679879269|3.0|The book starts out fine (though I find it hard to get back into the plot after waiting for three years.)He ruins the book by making it all religious and adding stuff about the underworld. PLus he seperates Will and Lyra right when they figure out they're in love, though they're only 12 or something. Just when I start to like her parents he throws them in a bottomless pit. Also, I don't see how the scientist lady tempted them, what happened to Will and school, and wasn't Asriel trying to kill the authority? what happened to that? I got really confused. So I guess just cuz I couldn't put the book down, doesn't mean it was the perfect finish for the series.
B000050XEI|5.0|The first track is a good intro to this CD. It is piano driven and we dont actually hear Enya singing. From the first track, it transcends to Wild Child, which is mesmerising.       However, my favourite song in this CD is Only Time. The song is so light and easy. I was completely relax by this song. The remaining tracks are all listenable. I would not want to compare this album with her previous CDs because I fell that, this Cd has a different set of meaning. If you like Enya and her previous songs, get this CD then, it is totally ethereal listening to her
0811826848|4.0|As a long time Beatle fan I have read over 100 books on the band and own close to 50. This book intrigued me as I found some photos and quotes that I truly had never seen before. My critique is that because the Beatles and a few select close friends are the only ones telling the story, there is not as much balance as I would prefer to see. It is important to see things from all sides and this book only is the view from the inside looking out. If one has read a multitude of books on the band, then this is refreshing and informative. If this is one's first introduction to Beatle literature then also reading &#34;Shout&#34; by Phillip Norman, &#34;The Beatles, an Illustrated Record&#34; by Roy Carr and Tony Tyler &#34;The Beatles, an Authorized Biography&#34; by Hunter Davis, &#34;The Love You Make&#34; by Peter Brown and Steven Gaines (for a start) to gain a more whole view of the subject is a good idea. This book is invaluable, as we hear the interpretation of events that changed the face of music as well as the world, from those who participated. Yet, I would have appreciated a non-involved assessment of many of the issues discussed. The Beatles (especially McCartney) tend to engage in a bit of &#34;revisionist history&#34; much to the detriment of this book and the disappointment of those who have read volumes on this band. Also the size and weight of the book make it a difficult read. Considering the sheer volume of information and pictures that are contained, it must have been difficult to design. It might have been a better idea to make the book thicker and not so large in height. It is impossible to carry. I also would have liked to hear about some issues which the Beatles seem to always avoid discussing. McCartney's sudden relationship break with Jane Asher, as well as his other relationships, John Lennon's mental health status (actual, not his bizarre theories on it) Brian Epstein's personal life and how it affected the Beatle's careers ect. All in all, thiswas an enjoyable read and a good starting point or addition to a library of Beatle related literature. However, other books should also be read in order to get a more inclusive view on this always interesting subject.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Absolutely beautiful.  That about sums up the feel of this CD...Dido's voice is a mixture of Sinead O'Connor and Sarah McLachlan, with a little of Sade's smoothness thrown in for good measure.  However, even with all these comparisons, her voice stands uniquely on it's own as an instrument of power.  It has an emotional edge to it that really makes you want to pay attention to the music rather than just let it play in the background.  If you have heard and liked the song &quot;Thankyou&quot; either on the radio or as part of Eminem's song (I'll forgive her for that!) then you won't be disappointed with the rest of this CD...especially the first track, &quot;Here With Me.&quot;  I would recommend this CD to anyone!
068484267X|1.0|I read this book for my book club and it was a difficult and slow book to get through. Several of us in the club were not impressed. His life was very difficult and I didn't enjoy reading about all the tragedy and obstacles he faced.  I never felt like their was a light at the end of the tunnel for him or this book.
B00003CXIY|2.0|I was very disappointed in this DVD. I purchased it with the idea that there would be some new footage in the unrated version that was not shown in the theatres, but I couldn't find anything that I hadn't seen before. Unlike American Pie, which had a very good unrated version, this one fails to be any different than the rated &quot;R&quot; version shown with its theatrical release. While I enjoyed the movie originally, I wouldn't have bought this DVD knowing what I do now. If you're thinking of buying this in order to find something new and interesting, please save yourself the trouble and money and don't click that button.
0525945636|1.0|Ken Follett is one of my favorite authors and I will forgive this sloppy deviation from his normally well constructed plots and flowing script. The first chapter really grabbed me and I eagerly read on, expecting more of the same. However, about sixty pages into it, I began to get the feeling that Mr. Follett was suffering from writer's block and let some 17 year old kid take over. Nevertheless I read thru to the end, but didn't really need to. The plot turned out to be incredibly amateurish and predictable. The shallow characters he created did not inspire me to wish any of them well. Has he joined the ranks of authors (ie: J. Patterson, P. Cornwell, J. Grisham etal) who, having been assured success based on previous acceptance, indulge in word mongering in order to crank out books in time for Xmas? I hope not. It would be impossible to reach perfection every time, but from Ken Follett I expect better than this. I hope the book's sales reflect the less than mediocre quality of this work. Maybe then the real Ken Follett will return!

0385484518|4.0|I just picked this book up from a display and started to read and I was totally hooked. To read these amazing experiences written so honestly and plainly by a MAN (I was surprised at the depth of emotion in this book - guess I have a few things to learn)really held my attention.  This book is very sincere and direct. Mitch Albom does a fantastic job of passing on to the reader the thoughts, values, lessons, attitudes, love and friendship that he recieved from Morrie! What a wonderful gift, I'm so glad I read it! <br />This book does have moments of sorrow, but this is NOT a sad, sappy, depressing account of a dying man. After reading this my attitude about death, illness, and even everyday life was all changed for the better.
B000056QD7|5.0|This album by Britney Spears is the best. It has great songs and enhanced videos. Here is my reveiew of the album.<br />1.Oops I Did It Again-great song! has a good beat and definitely something to make you get up and dance. 5 stars.<br />2.Stronger-another great song!It's the type of song you hear at clubs and parties because it's so rock roll. 5 stars.<br />3.Don't Go Knockin' on My Door-Great Song! Another dancer. This or song 6 will probably become Britney Spears's next single because they're such food songs. 5 stars.<br />4.(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction-a good song, but a little boring. This is kinda like what Soda Pop was on BOMT but still a dance song, I'll tell you that. 4 stars.<br />5.Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know-a great slow song. This is something you play for your girlfriend on a romantic date. Britney Spears also said this was her favorite song off this album. 5 stars.<br />6.What U See(Is What U Get)-great song!!Like I said before, this is most likely to become Britney's next single. I love this song! It is the bomb!! 5 stars.<br />7.Lucky-great song.This song is a story, really about a girl named Lucky. The lyrics are great and it's got a wonderful tune that doesn't annoy when it's stuck in your head like some other songs by other artists. 5 stars.<br />8.One Kiss From You- a really good song. It's got a great beat to it. This song is like Thinkin' About You on BOMT, another good song. 5 stars.<br />9.Where Are You Know-great slow song. Believe me everybody, this will reach your heart. It's the best song on the album. It shows such emotion. This is my favorite song. This needs 6 stars.<br />10.Can't Make You Love Me-a rock, little rap song. It's got a tune that will be in your head while you sleep. 5 stars.<br />11.When Your Eyes Say It-another great song. This is song you sing to the person you love. 5 stars.<br />12.Girl In The Mirror-a good slow song for girls. It has slow tune and very sad. It's definitely not my song, but some people might like it. 3 stars.<br />13.You Got It All-another good song. This should have been on the U.S. version. It's a song with a beat that won't get stuck in your head, but still be fun to listen to. 5 stars.<br />14.Heart-great song. This and the next song, I heard, were co-written by Britney. This is a song that will help you get over your problems like a break-up, death, or any type of loss/problem. 5 stars.<br />15.Dear Diary-great song. This song is really good. Britney even admitted in an interview that some of the lyrics were actually in her diary. If you fantacise about somebody, this your song. 5 stars.<br />16.Oops! Video. I love this video. 5 stars.<br />17.Lucky video. Britney looks so beautiful in this video.5 stars.<br />18.Stronger video. This is almost 10 times better than the song.5 stars.<br />19.Oops! (Karaoke) Britney sings Oops with an audience. 5 stars.<br />20.Lucky (Karaoke) Britney sings Lucky with an audience. 5 stars.<br />21.Stronger (Karaoke) Britney sings Stronger with an audience. 5 stars.<br />If you like Britney Spears's videos and concerts/tv specials, this is the cd for you.
0425163407|4.0|In this installment of the Kay Scarpetta series, the author again demonstrates her excellent story-telling skills.  She is superb at plotting these gothic, yet not too gory, thrillers.<br />Just a couple of problems, though, that led to this book being only just satisfying.  First, after weaving an intricate plot over several hundred pages, the revelation of the bad guy is quite rushed and an anti-climax - it was all over in just paragraphs and I'm not completely persuaded of this person's motivations.  Secondly, the author's characterisations are going off beam somewhat.  The verbal exchanges of the characters, and Scarpetta's own narration, are at times superficial, predictable and quite sophomoric (to use a word that crops up regularly in this series).  As a result I would have been happier to give this book three and a half stars, if that were available.  <br />Much as I find Scarpetta an iconic figure in the genre, this really relies on earlier installments in the series.  The stories would need to tighten up in the areas mentioned above before I'd again rank the series with the best in the genre.

0553579908|5.0|When I started reading A Song Of Ice And Fire series I had my doubts that it's going to be the same old story all over again where there is one main character with a mission. Don't get me wrong most of the series that I read who are based on that percpective are great. But, this series offers more. There is no certain main character. It is a story where any character can die at any time which is great. Why? Well, as you read the other books and a main character is in trouble you say : &quot;Ah well he can't die.. the author won't let him.&quot; Which makes it predictable but Martin have created a series so unpredictable and so marvelous I couldn't put any of his books down. On other note, to adress those people who are yelling that there is too many sex scenes and too much bad language, bugger off. This is no kiddie tale where a character is one sided. People swear, soldiers swear, most people can't go 2 phrases without swearing. Since this book is based on The War Of Roses, do you think that soldiers, knights and criminals didn't swear back then? In my opinion they don't swear enough. Someone even went as far as to write a letter to Martin about the bad language and the sex scenes. Well, this is no tv show where the producers have to worry not to offend the viewers. This is as real as you ever get which makes this series even better than the other ones. Martin's books just keep getting better and I applaud him.

0440234743|4.0|I started reading Grisham when The Firm was on the bestseller lists, and the only reason I haven't stopped is because I've read him for so long that I can't give up now. Fortunately, this book stands out as one of Grisham's better undertakings, not falling into any of his now familiar plot formulas. This book also evokes a non-denominational, though nominally Christian, spirituality that sets it apart from his other novels. Its spirituality succeeds because it accomplishes it without any tenor of preachiness.<br />The one drawback, but one to which every reader of Grisham is well-accustomed, is the let's-wrap-it-up ending that always feels as though Grisham is trying to neatly tie up the ending of a movie so that Hollywood doesn't have to ruin the book for you. The only difference between the ending here compared to some of Grisham's previous efforts is that this one is more believable, if only because there are no that-could-never-happen-type embellishments to tie it all up.<br />Overall, the protagonist and his quarry are nicely multi-faceted, though some of the other characters, namely the heirs and their lawyers, fall into some rather familiar stereotypes.
B00004U5SC|4.0|I like Shane and always have.<br />A few things I noted:<br />- The commentary track on this DVD, by the Associate Producer and George Stevens's son, is pretty boring, and at times sounds like they didn't do a good job preparing for it, as if they're just making off-the-cuff remarks as they're watching the film for the first time in years. It could have been much better. One of the commentators even misquotes Brandon DeWilde's line: &quot;Shane! Come Back!&quot; when he mentions how the boy says &quot;Come back, Shane!&quot; This line is misquoted as often as Bogart's famous line in Casablanca (Bogart did NOT say &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot;).<br />- The &quot;continuity&quot; person should have been fired! In the scene where Ben Johnson throws his whiskey shot on Alan Ladd's shirt in the store/bar, the &quot;stain&quot; moves around on his shirt - first it's kind of on both sides, then in the next cut it's kind of an upside-down V on both sides, then it appears to be TOTALLY GONE, then it is a big blob in the middle of the shirt.<br />- During the fight when Joe Starrett comes to Shane's rescue, in one cut Starrett has blood all over his chin, but in the next cut his chin is clean, and then in the next cut he has blood on his chin again.<br />- It is humorously obvious that they &quot;miss&quot; with a lot of their punches in the fight scene in the bar, even though heads &quot;turn&quot; as if they'd been struck. On close examination, it was not a well-staged fight scene. I guess such scrutiny comes after having seen the movie about a dozen times or more.
B00004XONN|1.0|I'm already seeing this in the used CD stores.<br />Face it, a year from now anyone who right now THINKS they like this will look back and think &quot;what was I thinking&quot; ? I'll tell you what you were thinking &quot;I have to pretend to like this because people will think I'm intelligent and deep and complex..&quot;<br />Nothing here that hasn't been done before if you go back far enough.<br />Pretentious in the highest order.
B00003CXIY|5.0|If you love to laugh, this movie is for you.  There wasn't five minutes i didn't laugh.  However, the movie itself is a bit racey, so keep in mind of that when buying this for anyone under at least fifteen.  Buy the movie, love it, and enjoy!
B000002UA0|5.0|The song Have a Cigar asks &quot;the band is just fantastic that is really what I think oh by the way which ones Pink&quot; on the album Wish you here the answer is Syd Barrett.Having grown up listing to the 70's Album Oriented Rock on the F.M. radio.I spent years thinking it was Roger Waters. When they split I did not like the shell that called it self Pink Floyd.After hearing this album I must say here are the roots to Dark Side of the Moon,Wish You Were Here and Animals. The Sounds, The Effects are all full blown on this album They may have harnessed them better on those other albums but as Have a Cigar also startes &quot;they call that riding the Gravy Train.
B000051VWW|4.0|Sade isn't my absolute favorite band, but I can't think of another band that I've missed quite so much.  Quite simply, nobody does what this band does.  If you like Sade, you'll like &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;.  If you don't like them, this CD won't convert you.  <br />The smart instrumentation, Caribbean-like lazy feel, and throaty vocals are all there. The songs are a bit shorter, but otherwise this is Sade as if they'd never stopped making music.  What is new is the inclusion of (slight) hip-hop influences on songs like &quot;Flow&quot; and &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot;.  These influences are not pulled into &quot;update&quot; the band's sound; they are only used insomuch as they fit with Sade's established style.  Points for integrity.<br />What's wild is that a lot of the lounge music and even some acid jazz that has become so trendy since the mid-90's has a lot in common with Sade's music.  They were so ahead of their time. I remember how all the critics used to trash this band, yet every album soared up the charts regardless of what trends were in style at the time.  You just can't deny good music, and Sade proves that once again.
0688170528|4.0|I received this book as a gift, having never heard of the author.  I read the first page and was immediately hooked.  Picoult engages the reader from the first paragraph of the book and develops each of the main characters uniquely within the pages of the novel.  This book is one of those rare books in which I found myself as a reader physically unable to set the book down.  The twist of events, dialogue between characters, and the desire to find peace with the characters' lives kept me reading almost non-stop.   This book delves into some serious issues pertaining to teen suicide, family and friend relationships, and love based on many levels.  It is written clearly, precisely, and with heart.
B00000J2KY|4.0|Kubrick may not have faithfully rendered his source material, but the story of an obsessive male falling for a woman who is far too young to fulfill his expectations is engrossing nonetheless.  I was surprised to see how closely the track of this doomed relationship follows the scenario of that between alcoholic adults. This film is interesting when taken as a cautionary tale about the inevitabilities of any relationship between two immature people, blurred boundaries, selfishness, infidelities, lies and all.<br />LOLITA is well-made in some ways, frustrating in others.  The shock value is largely gone today, since the film contains very little beyond innuendo.  We know precisely what happens and when, of course, but it's all done in a very 50s-repressed filmic style.  James Mason's Humbert Humbert is a neurotic when we first meet him, and whatever elements of his past have set him up to fall for Lolita at first sight are never really explained. We meet Lolita in the only lascivious shot of the movie, sunbathing in her back yard.  Sue Lyons plays a younger teenager (a couple years older than the Lolita of the novel, actually) with a very accurate child-woman-like combination of boredom, pouting, self-absorption, giggling and see-sawing between moods.  Shelley Winters is annoyingly right as the needy, pitiable mother, and Peter Sellers is good in a rare serious role as Lyon's other elder love interest who has no ethical compunction about interfering with Humbert's pursuit of Lolita.<br />Had Mason simply rented the room from the mother in order to dally with the underage girl, the story would not be nearly as disturbing, though perhaps just as controversial.  But it takes a nasty turn when it becomes clear that Humbert is willing to marry the mother, whom he despises, in order to stay close to Lolita in hopes of a seduction.  The fact that Humbert keeps a diary of his feelings only adds to our distaste for him -- this is not a man with whom the male audience can easily identify. His laughter while reading a love declaration from the mother says it all beautifully.  Humbert is too sad, dissipated and cynical to be sympathetic.  If his soul isn't already lost, he loses it by marrying the mother.<br />On the other hand, Humbert is second only to Lolita herself in our sympathies in this crowd.  The mother is so unlikable that we are tempted to laugh and cheer aloud when she dies unexpectedly, and Peter Sellers' Quilty is such a jerk that we can't certainly root for him.  So we are left to ponder the predicament of Humbert, and witness his foreordained demise.<br />Every beat with Lolita seems authentic to me.  She is the troubled schoolgirl allowing herself to be flattered by older men, learning it is easier to tell them what they want to hear regardless of the truth, but never committing in her heart and doing exactly as she pleases in their absence.  She cries like the little girl she still is when Humbert finally tells her that her mother has died.  And she finally seeks a saner refuge with a boy her own age and opts for the decidedly less risky life of a wife and mother herself, still treating Humbert a little bit like a dad or a rich uncle.<br />The truest thing in the movie for me is the sequence in which Humbert visits Lolita, pregnant and married.  The whole scene is a triumph and in a way the lesson of the movie summed up.  Lolita survives and remains largely ignorant of the destruction she has inadvertantly been a party to as a child and the pain she continues to give poor, lost Humbert by never falling in love with him.  She seems, in fact, the most grown up and the best armored of all the characters in this movie, but knowing what we know about the toll older men often take on underage girls, probably isn't as bullet-proof as she appears.<br />Readers and movie-goers often come to this story looking for titilllation and, I would imagine, go away either missing the point entirely or, hopefully, having learned something about the stupidity, the hopelessness, and the inevitable disappointment of pursuing a liason with an immature partner, innocent or not.<br />It is of considerable import that at the end of the story, Quilty is shot dead and Humbert dies an old man's death of heart failure in prison -- both men roundly humiliated -- while Lolita, who was always the master of her own fate, really, has grown up and charted a simple but appropriate life for herself with someone her age.thing about the stupidity, the hopelessness, and the inevitable disappointment of pursuing a liason with an immature partner, innocent or not. <br />It is of considerable import that at the end of the story, Quilty is shot dead and Humbert dies an old man's death of heart failure in prison -- both men roundly humiliated -- while Lolita, who was always the master of her own fate, really, has grown up and charted a simple but appropriate life for herself with someone her age.

If anyone in the Hollywood entertainment community with some clout is reading this, let's find out who optioned this book for a movie script and get it to the big screen!
0385495323|5.0|I bought &quot;The Code Book&quot; because of my long fascination with codes and ciphers. While it does have a marvelous treatment of modern 20th century cryptography- including the best description of the German Enigma machine and WWII Bletchly Park decoding activities I've yet read- what really makes this book shine is all the marvelous historical material.<br />Most books on codes and ciphers begin with something like ancient Roman transpotion ciphers. Singh takes a different track. For him, what's most interesting is not the encoding- which is often a trivial process- but the attempts to break encrypted texts. To this end, Singh tells the story of the decypherment of Linear B, an ancient script that was for decades in the 19th century perhaps the greatest puzzle confronting scholars. The tale of the decipherment of Linear B is not only a gripping and fascinating tale in and of itself, but also the perfect story to introduce the reader to the methodology of codebreaking.<br />From Linear B to quantum encryptation, Singh explains it clearly and fully; he's both skilled mathematician and gifted teacher. This is a marvelously entertaining and illiminating read, not only for those interested in the nuts and bolts of cryptography but for those curious about the historical context as well.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD is absolutely excellent if you like the REAL DEAL when it comes to Appalachian/Mountain style music.  Everything is here, from haunting and powerful spiritual ballads to bluegrass style tunes that will get your toes tappin' and bring a smile to your face.  This collection is a total winner, there is not a bad track on it.  Then again, one glance at the artists who contributed and you could have guessed that.  Buy this one, you won't be sorry!
0064435962|5.0|This is a fantastic book!  The large, colorful pictures and the simple, clear text keep children bending and stretching right along with the animals!  Still, unlike many of the reviewers who loved this for their one-year-olds, we found that this book didn't work for my active, not very verbal daughter when she was one (even though she sat for other books).  We pulled it out again around the time she turned 2 and she LOVED IT.  This book was a huge hit.  Now at almost 4 it is still one of her favorites.  Even if she's tired at bedtime she gets on the floor to do her donkey kicks along with the donkey!  My older daughter also reported that this was one of her preschool teacher's favorite storytime books.      I would say that for many children this book, despite it's deceptively simple pictures and text, is more appropriate for older children (age 2-4).  This is a book I buy all the time for 2nd birthdays - It's always a hit!  (especially good for active kids who prefer being &quot;active&quot; listeners!)        This is an excellent choice for a book that will last kids for years!
052594527X|5.0|Most good books you can not put down. This one you want to put down so that it is never over. A wonderful story that incorporates history, much like the Titanic. Great depiction of The Delft and the way of life in 17th century.
B00000IQCF|4.0|I hadn't seen a Aldomovar film (Tie me up ,tie me down) in a few years after seeming much of his work in the eighties. I was looking forwrd to his style, known for bizarre characters and twisted tales I was ready for more. I was a little let down as it seems one of Spain's major film makers has tempered his outrageousness and almost gone Hollywood. I enjoyed this movie very much but it was different from what I'd experienced with his earlier efforts. The tale does not have the Aldomovar flare for strange characters , they are too ordinary. The story evolves around love affairs, combined with suspense over who's doing who(it's easy to figure out), a plot that intrigues but doesn't blow your mind.  There are some pretty good performances, most notably by Francesca Neri as Elena, the sultry, primary woman of the movie, and Victor as played by Libertu Ratal, Elena and her husband's nemisis, or so it seems. I was a little disappointed with the early exit of Peneolupe Cruz as the mother of Victor, but she was good while she lasted. The characters are believeable for the most part but I had troubles with the parapalegic husband of Elena.  The story follows the troubled life of a young man, Victor, who gets caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time and serves some jail time. Upon his release he becomes involved in the lives of those most responsible for his time in jail. He gets involved with a married woman who wants to teach him to be the best lover ever, he believes it. It is not the usual tale of revenge, retribution can be sweet. The twists and turns are here but it is easy to see the oncoming traffic.  The music to the movie is fantastic. Plenty of Spanish music that further laments the story. The only problem I had was trying to read the credits so I could seek out some of the performing artists. Great soundtrack of tradional Spanish songs. All in all this is a stylish movie, unlike his earlier works, a pretty good plot and very entertaining. A good movie with a limited amount of violence and nudity, done in good taste. I prefer his older movies but this is still pretty good.limited amount of violence and nudity, done in good taste. I prefer his older movies but this is still pretty good.
B0000039PW|5.0|Biggie is truely the greatest rapper of all time and although despised by parents and people who regard this music as junk it is clearly the cream of the crop when rap is concerned, the album is totally worth the money and every one of the tracks on this album is original (even now in the year 2001), it is hard to criticise this album because it is an instant classic to all that have heard of the album, and those who do not originally like it will find it grows on them. My favourites include &quot;JUICY&quot;, &quot;GIMME THE LOOT&quot;, &quot;RESPECT&quot;, and &quot;EVERY DAY STRUGGLE&quot; which only just manage to gain my attention over the other tracks which are also great.<br />Unlike later albums puffy is much less present in this album and biggie clearly benefits with solo efforts and treats such as &quot;THE WHAT&quot; with method man<br />Do Not Hesitate, BUY IT!
078322804X|5.0|This movie is a true classic.  No doubt about it.  I grew up in Chicago and I guess I have a larger sense of pride about it.  SNL movies were started with BB - and it is far and awya the best one.  It isn't even close.  <br />A true comedy mixed with some great blues music make this one movie you can watch over and over again.  John Belushi was a master-and he is sorely missed.<br />I am still sick about Blues Borthers 2000....why mess with perfection?
B000021Y74|5.0|Run Lola Run was recommeded to me when someone found out I was a German teacher.  I rented it right away and was taken on a thrill ride!  This movie is fast-paced, including a great soundtrack.  Lola's character overcomes a lot in just twenty minutes and you get a sense of her life as you live out three different scenarios with her.  As a German teacher I would love to show this movie to my students simply to point out countless aspects of German culture.  The only downside for non-German speaking viewers is having to keep up with some quick subtitles from time to time when things get really fast paced!  All in all, an excellent movie!
B000002H38|5.0|I THINK ANITA BAKER IS AWESOME.  SHE HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN HER CREDIT THAT'S DUE TO HER.
B000050XEI|1.0|I mean really! She's been at this for about 14 years now: every couple of years re-record the same songs as before, with perhaps just a few minor differences, get that Nicky Ryan bloke in to produce it, then punt it out to the world and wait for the readies to flood in. It's no wonder she's one of the richest women in the UK/Eire (seriously - she has dozens of millions in the bank; she topped a recent magazine poll of the UK's richest women).<br />In this day and age, every other artist in the world has to strive and struggle to get a recording contract and to get the their music heard. Why should Enya get an easy ride? I'll tell you why - it's because the record companies know that punters will buy her albums in droves irresepctive of the quality. Other bands from the late eighties (when Enya first started) have gone on to make challenging and imaginative new music, but seem to have enormous difficulty finding a record deal (such as Lloyd Cole &amp; The The), while Enya carelessly tosses out bland pseudo-classical pop in cynical fashion without a care in the world.<br />It's all just another symptom of how the major record labels are concentrating only on the artists they know will make the most money, and ignoring the artistic integrity and musical variety of all the others. <br />And to add insult to injury, she only bothered to record 37 minutes worth. Maybe she found her own music so boring she couldn't bring herself to add any more. No? Come on Enya! Another twenty minutes of ambient humming and plinkety-plonk piano might've made all the difference!<br />Here's hoping for some electric guitar or a drum solo on the inevitable sixth album, due in 2004.
014100018X|4.0|This delightful short novel spans the time from the day before Ash Wednesday (that is, Carnival, Mardi Gras) through the day after Easter.  Each chapter is one day in Lent, each chapter given a day and a date, but with the year left vague.  During that course we have sin, suffering, death, and hilarious redemption.  A very effective device.<br />Having said that, I will also say that, although the book clearly had appeal, I almost didn't buy it because I found the first paragraph awkward.  Grammatical and syntactical awkwardnesses continued to be irritating throughout the book, occasionally even leading to sentences where different interpretations of meaning were possible.  And attempts to portray French regional dialect in English were often clumsy and annoying as well.<br />Part way through my reading (November 2000) I started hearing more and more about the just-released film version.  I had surely expected Johnny Depp would play the part of Reynaud, the tortured priest, full of hate, hiding a hideous memory (some of the chapters are in his voice, his ramblings to an old and infirm priest, and these chapters are set in a slightly darker typeface, another nice touch), and was very surprised to find he is cast as Roux, the gypsy.  The press and ads for the movie may be misleading, but it seems Roux may have a much bigger role in the movie than he does in the book.  I hope not, because I can't imagine giving Roux a bigger influence without having to diminish the dark and sinister role of Reynoud.  And I've heard there's a mayor in the film, who I don't remember from the text at all, yet I've heard no mention of Anouk, the daughter, nor of the very important part played by Tarot cards.  Well, we'll see....<br />But one thing for sure, any pastry shop near the theatre should do a booming business after the show!  The chocolates themselves, in all their varieties -- pastries, confections, drinks with and without liqueurs -- are described in such loving sensuous detailin the novel, it was impossible not to long for the taste while reading.  So much for Lenten resolutions!
B00003CWOL|5.0|This movie makes me smile.<br />Firstly, it's a smart film.  The characters definitely have a handle on their opinions, their &quot;good ideas&quot; and goals.  As far as I could see nothing stopped them from saying them (even God herself.  Jay's little tirade in front of her had me laughing so hard that fell out of my seat at the theatre).  I like characters who aren't all wishy-washy and who don't waffle around unless they have a character-changing experience.  Also, The issues raised range from the common (&quot;Is abortion right or wrong?&quot;) to the heirarchical (&quot;Is Catholicism stodgy and arcane?&quot;) to the silly (&quot;Do Bishops really bless their golf clubs for a better game?&quot;) to the divine (&quot;Is God a 'he' or a 'she'?&quot;).  And all the characters are well-educated about THAT as well.<br />&quot;Dogma&quot; does not suffer from lack of opinions or perspectives, to be sure.<br />Secondly, it's an emotional film.  The scene between Linda Fiorentino and Alan Rickman at the lake when she asks the burden of her quest be removed from..  and the Metatron says that her Ancestor said the same thing to him: &quot;Please make this go away.&quot;  For the first time since I was a child I remembered the tragedy built up around the Birth of Christianity (or Catholicism or whatever...)<br />Thirdly..  come on: Alanis Morisette as God.  How much more fabulous could it be?<br />For those who think it's insulting and degrading to the Mother Church, well, no one said you had to watch it.  Sadly, most of those who protested DIDN'T watch it, yet protested anyway.<br />See &quot;Dogma&quot;, form an opinion and let me know what you think.  I for one found it to be an amazing fantasia, full of faith and fun.
0790749815|5.0|I saw this film as a child at the theatre, I have owned it in Beta, VHS and now DVD. I have probably watched it 40-50 times and I never get tired of it. I'm not going to describe it, the previous writer's have done a marvelous job with that.I will comment on the supurb job WB did in the conversion to DVD. Respect to Hitchcock and his talent was obvious. To many times the studio's have cheaped out for the fast buck in converting the &quot;classics&quot; because they require more technical transfer and appeal to a smaller market. That was not the case here, the Vistavision print lent itself to a marvelous conversion and the re-enginered DD 5.1 gives cutting edge technology to a stellar soundtrack. As previously stated a fascinating group of extras is in included. This is a film that will endear itself to the movie public for a very long time and continue to be a standard against all others of it's genre. Now, only if WB would get rid of those cheap cardboard snap cases.
0517209764|4.0|Well, it's not the best and definitely not the worst, but what you buy is what you get.  This book of course comes in the play version form, you know, with the Act I, Scene II kind of thing.  And I know it's not in story book form but what'd you expect? It's the complete works and probably how he wrote it in the first place.  It has all the plays(by SHAKESPEARE) that you could ask for, including poetry and sonnets.  I think that so far it has been a  thrill and an interesting read.
B0000025R3|4.0|I've always enjoyed this album and Cargo since the day they were both released. Solid hooks and great songs mixed with great memories.The band photo on the inside is great.
0140067477|5.0|Benjamin Hoff has taken an intricate and complex philosophy and distilled it to its essence in the delightful Tao of Pooh. This is much easier to read and understand than the I Ching (Book of Changes) or the Tao ti Ching (Book of the Way.) With Pooh as your guide, Hoff clearly articulates the lessons and tenets of the Tao (&quot;the Way&quot;).<br />Taoism, a Chinese peasant religion and philosophy, was founded by Lao Tzu in the 5th century BC. Essentially it urges its followers not to resist the natural ebb and flow of life - after all, nature will always win, so why waste the energy? Hoff, using Pooh and the other characters of the Hundred Acre Wood, illustrate how &quot;the Way&quot; is practiced in day-to-day situations.<br />Yet there is more to this wonderful little book than an elucidation of Taoism in practice. Hoff takes neither himself or his subject too seriously, often times having &quot;conversations&quot; with Pooh who, in his almost child-like simplicity, both emphasizes and embodies living &quot;the Way&quot;.<br />This is no children's book - but it is fun to read for its message, its messenger and its content. I recommend it without reservation.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is my favorite U2 album. I've been a big fan of Howie B since his work with Massive Attack. I enjoy every song on this album except track nine. That song is filler. I gave it five stars because Howie B's beats clearly made up for that filler track.
0553275976|5.0|I saw the bizarre trainwreck of a movie many moons ago and did not give much thought to reading the book.  There are times I wonder at my own stupidity.  It was only as the year 2001 dawned that I began smarten up.  Why had I never read this book?  Got me.  Two my favorite books of recent vintage owed a debt to Wolfe (or mentioned him outright): Turn of the Century (Kurt Anderson) and Last Days of Disco (Whit Stillman).  I figured maybe it was time to read the Master himself.<br />I remember when Man in Full came out, it was as if George Washington himself had risen from the dead.  Who was this guy?  I consider myself quite well-educated, but it was time educate myself about Tom Wolfe.  I bought the paperback.<br />I just finished it.  I'm sad because the book ended.  I love anything about the '80s, but this book basically defined it.  The style is priceless as are the characters.  These characters, even the smaller ones, Abe Weiss, Miss Shelly Thomas, Arthur Ruskin among them, are fully formered.  The book is a true masterpiece. I knew it was a satire, but came to really care about these characters, winners and losers all of them.  When I took a step back I could see the brillance the names in this book, satirically speaking:  The author Nunnally Voyd, the law firm Dunning, Sponget, and Leach.  And on and on.  Peter Fallow.  I should stop here.  Readers should find out these treasures on their own.  The book is so great because it evokes a time not long ago yet now a memory.  Wolfe brings it life again.  It works at so many levels. Tragedy, farce, brillance... Don't be dumb like I was.  Just go read it.  You'll thank the true of Master of the Universe later.
B0000041JU|4.0|Altough I consider the Croatian pianist Ivo Pogorelich to be perhaps the greatest living pianist, I can't uncriticaly endorse this recording. I have heard Pogorelich play both these works in concert, mark my words, it was phenomenal. My problem here is the recording quality.       After Pogorelich recorded the Liszt sonata he was criticized for having chosen a sound that was too close to the piano, too direct in other words, without any projection. I didn't mind so much because it allows one to hear each note clearly, and to enjoy Pogorelich's great tonality. In this recording, as with the recording of Chopin's scherzos which came a year later, the listener feels as if he is located at the back of a church. The projection of the sound is too distant, notes become mudled together and lose their definition. During some cascades of sound the blending of notes is so great that you lose all sense of melody. What a shame, for Ravel's first waltz would so benefit -with its sharp, rythmic performance- from a close microphone, and yet it is too clamy sounding to be really enjoyed. I hope Mr. Pogorelich returns to the sound quality of his earlier CD's. I find the latest releases deny us the oportunity to enjoy fully what makes him great.
B000050FEN|3.0|The movie had an erie sence about it, I kept thinking it would improve, but it stays on an even keel of one murder after another for the sake of providing us with the &quot;Plan&quot; the murderer has to rack up SEVEN bodies for his twisted plot. I also thought Brad Pitt was too young an actor for the Role, needless to say, I wasn't thrilled.
0783225970|5.0|I first saw this movie with my father when I was 17 when it first came out. The violence and language made me feel uncomfortable (being with him) but I couldn't stop watching it anyway because it is an interesting story, with interesting characters. I think Al Pacino was born to play the lead character Tony in this movie - he plays it that well.<br />Seeing what happens to Tony in the end serves as an example how drugs can change your life for the worse. Even though drugs allowed him to rise to the heights of financial success, they were also his ultimate undoing. This is a powerful message told in this movie, and was one I think influenced me in a positive way in my adult life. This is one of the reasons I rate it five stars, Al Pacino is the other.<br />Do not watch this movie if you don't have a stomach for graphic violence or the &quot;F&quot; word in every other sentence. This language certainly builds a strong persona of Tony and it would be a completly diffent movie without it. If you think you can handle it, then you should take a look at this film for the story that it tells in a very dramatic fashion. Al Pacino is great, and Michelle Pfiefer looks great!<br />FYI, Tony's Sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) went on to be the lead woman in &quot;The Abyss&quot;.
6305364613|4.0|An excellent fast paced adaptation. However, it's MUCH more impressive on a large screen. If you ever get a chance to see it in a theatre, I highly recommend it. I'm not a huge DiCaprio fan, but he does a decent job here.<br />The cinematography is amazing. Again, this really is only true on a large screen where you tend to get lost in the camera movements (in a good way). On a regular TV, the cinematography loses a lot, which takes away greatly from the film.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I don't know how it happened and why but CS&amp;HDFW is really really BAD! Significant Other was a a GREAT album! But this new record doesn't do anything. It sounds like the previous. Oh and I don't think Fred Durst's voice is very good...at all. But I do like Wes's costumes/makeup.
0783226888|4.0|An excellent movie. I'll say that it doesn't compare to other &quot;hitman&quot; favorites of mine, such as The Professional or the original Day of the Jackal. But I'll say this: I was never a real fan of Bruce Willis, until I saw this movie. The plot develops strongly as the movie progresses. You begin to see the changes in Willis' character, going from cool and smooth to jumpy and paranoid near the end. You learn more about each character as the story progresses as well. I'll admit, the hit at the end was dimunitive of its potential. Not because of the subject's role, but because he/she wasn't an actual person.<br />The original film had DeGaul as the subject, making the film more shocking and serious. The target in this movie would have been pleasing if he/she was an actual person.<br />Besides the shortcomings of the conclusion, I still find this movie very interesting. Definitely worth seeing. There is some fine acting and scenery.
B000002BUY|5.0|I just wanted to say that this CD is just about the best one I own! There is not one song on the entire CD that I could not stand to listen to 100 times! If you're interested, I personally think the best songs are A Certain Shade of Green, Idiot Box, Redefine, and New Skin. Oh and I know Magic Medicine is a little umm...different at first, but soon you'll love it! And defintely pop it into your computer for a really nice treat:)Brandon-you ROCK!
B000002U9W|4.0|This disc is a little bit of a surprise.  Upon first listen you might think to yourself that it really isn't worth your time but it will eventually surprise you.  To start we have &quot;Atom Heart Mother Suite&quot; which is rather boring in many parts but is really strong in others.  It is rather long and probably too long considering a good part of it is simply useless. I think if it were condensed down to about 10 minutes it could have been much more enjoyable.  I would rank it a weak &quot;4&quot; out of &quot;5&quot;.  Second we have the track &quot;If&quot; which is quite subtle.  It is a nice song but nothing ground breaking here either.  I would rate it a solid &quot;4&quot;.  The third song is &quot;Summer Of '68&quot; and is probably the best on the disc.  It was actually written and sung by Rick Wright and is one of his best he ever wrote lyrically.  I would give it a weak &quot;5&quot;.  The fourth song is &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; and it is a weak &quot;5&quot; also.  It is another very subtle song as most of the music on this disc is.  The last track titled &quot;Alan's Pchycodelic Breakfast is not enjoyable in the least and is nearly a waste of disc space.  I rank it as one of the longest and most worthless songs Floyd has ever done.  I would give it a &quot;1&quot; out of &quot;5&quot;.  I think this disc is pretty decent but not comparable to Animals, Final Cut, Dark Side, WYWH, Obscured By Clouds,  The Wall or Meddle.  Of course that is pretty stiff competition and in reality what can stack up to those discs?  NOTHING........God bless
B00004XONN|5.0|This is one of radiohead's best records! I picked this is up the  day of its release, and when you first listen to it, it made me think that &quot;Hmm... this is not what i'm used listening to by radiohead&quot;. this is a more &quot;technic&quot; record as apposed to &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot;. I recommend that you sample &quot;OK Computer&quot; and get to know all the strange lyrics and and off the norm guitar riffs before listening to this CD. But if you a old school radiohead fan (back when the band was known as &quot;on a friday&quot;) you'll be surprised, but give this record a few times of listening, and you'll agree.. this is a Kick A$$ record!
B000055ZB8|5.0|In terms of mood, lighting, and just downright creepiness no version of Dracula made since has come close to this masterpiece. Max Schreck's characterization of Count Orlock comes the closest to the ancient Romanian folk tales of the &quot;Strigoi.&quot; When you watch this film you will notice the devices that other film makers have stolen, and even with modern technology at their disposal, have used to lesser effect. Now, if you prefer to have your films spoon fed to you, and your imagination is not up to the task, then don't watch this film. to those of you who are able to dive totally into &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; you will come to the same conclusion as countless others: This is the best Vampire film ever made.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day has grown up.  This album isn't as hard as their previous ones.  This one has alot more accoustic on it.  This is a very different sound.  It's not your average punk.  Very good album.  Best songs are Warning, Church on Sunday, Castaway, Minority, and Macys Parade.  This is a very good cd and definatly worth buying.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna's new album Music is definitely, without doubt one of her best albums. All songs on the album are worth listening. There are no filler songs, just one great song after another. Gone has to be the best song, the melody is just magnificent and the lyrics can relate to many people. The title track, Music absolutely rocks. My favourites are Gone, Music, What It Feels Like For A Girl, Runaway Lover, Impressive Instant, Nobody's Perfect and Amazing. Amazing sounds a lot like Beautiful Stranger, I don't know why some people don't like it. I absolutely love this album. Madonna is the greatest singer there is and this album proves it.
158234082X|4.0|Anthony Bourdain's skill as an author is still growing. However, his passion in telling the story of his life makes Kitchen Confidential an outstanding read. As a kitchen manager, line cook, saute', pantry cook, pastry chef and prep of fourteen years, I can say, yes, Kitchen Confidential is beautifully true. There is nothing that compares to the bunker comradery and adrenalin high of a well-oiled kitchen crew toiling as one during a four hour dinner rush... nothing. Bravo, Anthony.
0811826848|5.0|What a beautiful, sad, psycadelic journey into the lives of my *personal* fave FAB FOUR! (Alright, FAB THREE.*Sniff*)  The content of this monolithic book is really interesting, the Beatles say in thier own words things that they have done in their career. My gosh, I can't believe that I missed all that they talked about by 25 years...!   I like the early years, when each Beatle talked about their childhood. I love the pictures, the quotes....  Everything is perfect in this book.  It's a wonderful insight to all that the Beatles mean. Besides the Beatles, the book includes interviews with Neil Aspinall, George Martin, Mal Evans.... those sort of people. Really important, don't get me wrong.   I can't buy love on Amazon, but I think if you love Beatlemania, you should buy this book!
6305078564|5.0|What can you say about a series that inspires so much devotion?  The story is wonderful.  The casting is superb.  I will pull this movie out and watch it over and over again.  I love the DVD version, because now I can zip right through to all of my favorite parts.  If you have not seen this yet, I suggest a long day, a warm quilt and some great munchies, this is going to be a treat you want to prepare for.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Until I got #1 for Christmas, I thought the Beatles were...well, you know, not that great. I was rather ignorant of the fact that when I played one of their songs before #1, I thought, well, yeah. Just like other bands.  But no!  I had to get the Anthology Book, and I immediatly popped the CD in, while reading Anthology.  I was hooked.  It's been a week now, and I realise that this is no help with my review, but, well, I wanna tell you something.  I like that song, Something. Hey, George, if your're reading this, I love your song!  I think, as long as music endures, The Beatles will as well. That's my theory.  Paul, great songs, I love em!  Ringo, awesome drumming! And John....A rose for you.
0875847706|1.0|Following a suggestion in the book I gave the book an A, but I still wish I had my money back. However intriguing and even rewarding some of these ideas might ultimstely be, this is a sloppy, vague presentation of them. It is like sitting and listening to someone who has just gone through one of those Large Group Awareness experiences; they talk a lot about transformation and possibilities, but can only specify a few ambiguous examples. I had really looked forward to this book, and was immensely disappointed in spite of myself (no doubt an indication that I need to buy their next two books as well.)
B00003CWTI|5.0|magnolia is layers of wonderful acting and dialogue, not to mention out of this world cinematography and a beautiful sountrack by Aimee Mann. In the past, I have felt that some &quot;intertwining&quot; films have been gimmicky, and that there is always one story you want to get back to. Not magnolia! Every story was fabulous! The entire cast and crew put their hearts and souls into this film and it sure does show! I've seen this epic drama many times now, and every time, there's something new I appreciate about it! I won't go deep into evaluating the performances, because everyone is their own powerhouse, but Philip Baker Hall and William H. Macy moved me more than I have ever been moved before. It's a real dark and emotional film, so try to watch it on a sunny day, not one that is gloomy and raining cats and frogs... er... dogs.
0671775308|5.0|Wealthy people have a lot of money.  The way they became wealthy, the way they accumulated a lot of money, was by (take a deep breath) holding onto their money and not SPENDING it!  Well, DUH!  When you see some dude driving an expensive car, wearing an expensive suit and an expensive watch, taking expensive vacations and so forth, you must remember that all those things represent money he NO LONGER OWNS!<br />As Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged gave us the concepts and language to support and defend the absolute morality of capitalism, The Millionaire Next Door supplies us with the intellectual substantiation for being a tight-wad and not being one bit ashamed of it.<br />I will now get into my 13-year-old Honda (with 151,000 miles on it), drive down to the bank and look at all my money.
0804106304|5.0|I just recently finished reading one of your novels titled the Joy Luck club.  My stepmother recommended it saying I would enjoy it.  I can honestly say it was one of the hardest books to put down.  The only reason I did put it down was becuase it was late at night and I had to go to school the next day.   I myself enjoy readin short stories.  On of many great things about thsi book is that many women can relate to it.  The way you use detail is absoultly amazing.  Sometimes you feel so connected and lost in the book that is it is like you are actually in the book yourself.  This is a rare and mesmerizing novel that describes the love and misunderstanding that lies between two generations.   Any women can connect herself to June in the story.  She is a second generation chinese women who was raised in america.  Because all the stories are different you get the feel of what it was like being raised in china over 50 years ago. This is a great novel for anyone who enjoys reading stories based on actual historical eevents.  I did not know a thing about any of the strugglesthat women had to deal with.  I also didnt know anything abuot men being able to have more than one wife and the wives being called wife#1 and wifew#.  It is also nice to read a novel about a mother and daughter relationship. I would recommend this to any women, who enjoys short stories, interested in the culture and history of china, or anyone who would just like to sit down one night and read a great book
B000007177|5.0|Jethro Tull Nightcap-The Unreleased Masters 1973-1991 (Chrysalis/EMI Capitol)<br />This 2 CD set Nightcap-The Unreleased Masters 1973-1991 (Chrysalis/EMI Capitol) was only available as an overseas import until 2000. This is not an another Tull hits collection, but a collection of 31 unreleased completed master recordings that never saw the light of day for various reasons. The first CD Tullians will find this set a real treat as it includes the 1973 Chateau D'isaster Tapes which includes 13 songs that were due to be or be part of the next Tull album. Instead due to various upstarts that the band encountered the project was aborted and new work began on what became they're next album A Passion Play. Only 3 songs from the Chateau D'isaster Tapes appear on another release. &quot;Scenario,&quot; &quot;Audition,&quot; &amp; No Rehearsal&quot; all appear on the Tull 20th Anniversary Best Of 2 CD set. The second CD is a mix mash of 18 unreleased finished master recordings from the album sessions of  &quot;Rock Island,&quot; &quot;Catfish Rising,&quot; A Passion Play,&quot; Broadsword And The Beast&quot; &amp; Too Old To Rock And Roll&quot;. All in all the sound is excellent and the material is very interesting. A number of surprises wait for every set of Tullians ears. A+.
B00003CXN4|3.0|The movie was okay. It, however, definitely didn't live up to my expectation. I expected a lot when I went to see the movie since  Soderbergh directed it. Well, after viewing, I wasn't really blown away. Only thing i liked about this movie was the choice of film stock he used for the mexico scene. It was very grainy, which i thought was well suited for the mood of the scene and the emotion of the character (Benicio Del Toro). Unlike other cheap hollywood movies, he used the grainy images for the entire movie whenever that scene came on (a bold move).  Other than that, nothing was new.  some people said they liked the way he interwove multiple story lines or angles, but i don't think it was really new or a break through in filmmaking. And in terms of theme, nothing was new or profound. It's a same old story of somebody who's life gets screwed because of drug but because of dedication and moral obligation of others he/she gets a grip on their life again(or did I miss something?) Maybe I expected too much, but Soderbergh is too good of a director to be without high expectation.
0425170349|3.0|This is for the previous review entitled by 'A Reader.'<br />I think they have some bad information here.  It DOES get cold in Australia.  Did you know they have penguins in Australia?  It also snows there too?  Australia has a diverse climate, depending on where you go.  Much like America.
B000002UAR|5.0|The votes are in and the musicians have selected Revolver as the #1 rock album of all time.  With the wide range of sounds The Beatles produced during their career, I'll try to pinpoint how Revolver fits into the entire scheme of things.<br />It was before Sgt. Pepper and well after A Hard Day's Night.  It has a touch of their amazing pop and a touch of their new found psychadelia.  John Lennon claimed that their &quot;contemporary&quot; sound started with Revolver.  When you listen to Eleanor Rigby, Here, There, and Everywhere, Good Day Sunshine, you'll hear the amazing melodies and harmonies The Beatles were just beginning to perfect (strong influence from the Beach Boys' &quot;Pet Sounds.&quot;)  Tomorrow Never Knows takes you to another cranial dimension and indicates a sign of things to come.  Take a listen to that song and realize that She Loves You was written just 3 years before that.<br />This album is a flawless pop diamond.  A perfect transition between their catchy early &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; years and evolving psychadelia proves to be an angelic synergy.  If you want no-nonsense contemporary Beatles music without the innocence of She Loves You and without the peppiness of Sgt. Pepper, pick this album up and find out why musicians rated it #1.
B00004TL2N|5.0|If you believe you understand the power of music to speak in spiritual language then prepare yourself.  Boulez and the Vienna Philharmonic have approached the altar of the Bruckner Symphony No. 8 in a way that brings to mind all of the master conductors of the past century and for me he supercedes all other standards in this energizing, uplifting, transcendental recording.  Repeated hearings only open new windows of understanding about how Bruckner approached the Sacred Ideal in this organ-like symphonic architectural wonder.  The clarity we have come to expect from Boulez is keenly present to uncover lines hidden by other conductors' lack of vision.  This is a mighty and magnificent performance that deserves every honor it is gathering.  Celebrate yourself and buy it to play whenever the world is too much with you!

B00003CXDG|5.0|This is truly a great addition to the Mission Impossible series and being on DVD only makes it better.  I have to say that after reading some of the negitive reviews they make me wonder if they even watched the movie.  The story and acting are superb and the stunts and special effects are great.<br />The DVD edition has a lot of great extras including the making of many of the &quot;impossible&quot; stunts.  The sound and picture quality as expected are much better than the VHS edition and really makes for a greater viewing experience.  I myself really enjoyed this movie and found that the story was much improved over the first movie.  <br />The character developements in MI2 are a considerable improvement over the first installment and the story moves along nicely.  The stunts are mind-boggling and the special effects are great.  This is in my opinon the best of John Woo's movies and as an action movie has a great story and plot to accompany the superb action.  I highly recommend this movie as it is sure to entertain and provide a night of enjoyment.

B0000508U6|4.0|After reading all these reviews, I think it's fair to say that the song &quot;Yellow&quot; has hit a real emotional chord amongst the Westernized English-Speaking Under-45 part of the world. The appeal doesn't take a rocket science degree. It's just simply the best honest to goodness love song since &quot;Walk Away Renee&quot;. sniff...<br />(Sorry for getting sappy on you, I'll go put on some old Nugent albums to compensate....).
0783242808|3.0|This is a cute, even sweet, coming of ager with an attractive cast.  But be warned, if sex offends you, you will be offended.  It is also more than a little on the juvenile side, especially the first half or so.  I can't even discuss the subject matter on Amazon.com, which is just as well.  And you DON'T EVEN want to know why it is called &quot;American Pie.&quot;  Suffice it to say that if you're past your early twenties much of this will seem lame and adolescent.  If you're younger, you may just crack up over all the crude, but sometimes sharply observed humor.<br />Thus the question: why did I watch it?  Easy: Mena Suvari.  The beauty of American Beauty is here a drama dweeb--or is that a drama geek?  Actually she sings in a jazz class, which I suppose is close to the same thing.  At any rate, she is not a cheer leader nor the queen of the hop, just a pretty girl with values.  She is excellent.  Also good in a supporting role is Alyson Hannigan (from TV's Buffy) as a nerd girl who surprises with what she learned at band camp.  Eddie Kaye Thomas as the boy (Paul Finch) who learns that women only get better with age is just perfect.  However, I think Jason Biggs was a little lamer than was absolutely necessary.  Sean William Scott was true to his part as your classic neanderthal jock.<br />Funniest line, from Biggs, after finding Michelle gone in the morning: &quot;I was used--Cool!&quot;<br />Another reason for watching this film is that one does get some, no doubt twisted, idea of what passes for adolescent sexual preoccupation these days and can compare such notions to an earlier era.  Call it suburban anthropology.<br />As I was watching Mena Suvari I got to thinking about the appeal of her very captivating face.  Like fashion models and other stars with child-like faces, we adore her.  Why?  Call it neoteny. This led to a further thought.  In the future, as we continue to look more and more like our children, some day we and our children will look the same.  (Perhaps this could be a good idea for a science fiction story.)  Some say the appeal of imagined aliens is that they have child-like features (think of the big round heads and the big eyes).  But really they are unconscious caricatures of ourselves and the values that we most esteem, brains and photogenic eyes.<br />Anyway, American Pie is kind of sweet if you are not offended by vivid depictions of adolescent sexuality or crude bathroom humor.  And there is more sophistication to the relationships than might be supposed at first blush.  It ends at the prom, as all good American coming of age flicks should.  The boys grow up and begin to learn the difference between love and sex, and the girls find they no longer have to teach the boys how to kiss.  This is an American Graffiti for the new millennium.Perhaps this could be a good idea for a science fiction story.)

014100018X|4.0|I don't know what I was expecting when I picked up this book, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I decided to read this book because I saw a trailor for the movie and figured that I would prefer to try the book for depth instead.  This was a story of a vibrant, strong woman, and I greatly appreciated that.<br />The main character, Vianne Rocher, moves into this small town in France and decides to open a chocolate shop.  She's a colorful woman who stands out in this gray, drab town but is determined to fit in without compromising her ideals.  I find the way she confonts opposition to be inspiring.  This was a highly moving book.  I actually believe I felt myself becoming a rebel as I turned the pages.
B0000085N4|5.0|This is the consummate Cult disc.  It is pure hard driving, but melodic, rock and roll... a lot of fun.  I've been a Cult fan since '86, and I love all their work.  Each disc brings a new maturity...&quot;Love&quot; has a lot of melody, similar to, but better than,&quot;Dreamtime.&quot;  &quot;Electric&quot; was all riffs, and exciting, but sounded like it was produced in about 2 hours.  &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; is where it all came together.  Perfection.  Wait'll you hear &quot;Fire Woman&quot;, &quot;American Horse&quot;, and &quot;Edie (Ciao Baby)&quot;.  This is music to jam and dance to. Also - the band is fantastic live. Saw them in '87 &amp; '89.  We can always hope for a reunion.
B00003CXCS|1.0|I saw this film originally when I was a child, and it brought back many memories to see it again after all these years. What surprised me most was to discover how absolutely terrible this movie is. <br />If you like the music I guess you can fast forward through the rest of it.. but why not just buy the soundtrack? Why suffer through this abomination? I cannot really fault the actors, they do a reasonable enough job. I think they should be congratulated for keeping a straight face while participating in this bare-faced theatrical fraud. <br />From my point of view a film should attempt to be a believable portrayal of reality, or if not, there should be some point made by its disconnection with reality, whether that point be satirical or strictly humorous. This film wallows in the most unbelievable sentimental drivel from first scene to last. There isn't a single moment in the entire movie where you are under the impression that you are doing anything other than watching actors deliver mind-numbingly stupid lines.<br />Oddly enough I was actually looking forward to watching this movie, I had fond memories of it as a child. Maybe that's all it ever was, propaganda for children. A 'how to behave' movie for kids before they are smart enough to know better. If you have children you are trying to brainwash you might want to buy this, otherwise  GET REAL!
B000001E3V|4.0|As far as Eric Clapton goes, He is a guitarist that needs a cataylst to spark the flame.  If you look over his career he has always had someone to play along side of him in most of his &quot;outstanding&quot; performances.  This is 200% true in the case of Derek and the Dominos.  Before Duane Allman showed up for their sessions, Derek and the rest Delaney and Bonnie's band (Whitlock, Radle Etc) were hauled up in a house smashed out of their senses.  Duane came in and then they started recording the various jams that Duane and Eric would riff off.  I am so tired of hearing all of this &quot;god&quot; stuff about Eric Clapton. Yes he was an outstanding guitarists but don't make him something he is not.  If you want an example of where music can take you check out Allman's Live at Fillmore or get the D&amp;D box set and check out the JAMS disc with the ALLMAN BROTHERS and Eric Clapton.  That will clear everything up.  Please people be more openminded with your tastes because Eric is definitely not GOD. Thank you

B00003CXE7|5.0|Forget the comparisons to &quot;Braveheart,&quot; this film should be judged on its own merits.<br />If you want to find fault with this movie, there are certainly opportunities to do so, but, in my opinion, this movie is a rare gem with only minor flaws.<br />Regardless of what critics might say, if a film has a lasting emotional and visceral impact on me, then I will strongly recommend it to others.<br />The combination of stunning visuals, a moving musical score, and top-notch acting are the reasons why I ran out to buy the DVD (get the 2-disc set) when it was released. There are few movies that I would want to watch more than one time. Two examples are &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Boys Don't Cry.&quot; Both excellent films, and very moving, but once is more than enough.<br />By contrast, I can never get enough of Russell Crowe (&quot;Maximus&quot;) or Ridley Scott (the Director) who are the real stars of this film.<br />Ridley Scott is a genius for transporting the viewer to alien worlds whether they are in the far future (&quot;Blade Runner&quot;) or the distant past, as he does here in Gladiator.<br />If you are guy and the opening battle sequence does nothing to get your blood pumping, then you are, as Maximus exhorts his soldiers in that scene &quot;...already dead.&quot;
B00004XQ83|5.0|Red alert from the Centers for Disease Control: This CD is a powerful and effective vaccine against the dreary, dopey brainlessness of contemporary country.    &quot;O Brother&quot; is as good an introduction as you will find to the roots of American traditional music. There's enormous sweetness and soul here, not to mention musicianship beyond compare.    Most of the material on &quot;O Brother&quot; is newly recorded, by a roster of first-rate artists including Alison Krauss, Norman Blake, and the always-astonishing John Hartford, whose loving contributions to the preservation and extension of old-timey bluegrass music are beyond compare.    Inoculate your ears with &quot;O Brother.&quot; You'll be glad you did.
0553106635|5.0|George R.R. Martin is a fantsy prodigy. He has done the near-impossible: created a whole new world -- from top to bottom. Millions of people, thousands of places, tons upon tons of history. And every t's crossed and every i's dotted. This man didn't miss a thing. He plays by reality. None of this Faerie Comes to the Rescue bit. If you fall off a mountain-you fall. No faeries to save you and no magic to make you come back to life. Your dead. This is his reality (altough I must admit there is one exception, but my lips are sealed) and it's worth staying up till 3:00 to finish it. My sister actually introduced me to the Song of Fire and Ice series, and I loved it. And--this'll really throw you for a loop--Im 13. It just goes to show that age and reading has no corospondence whatsoever, and never let the size of a book throw you off, 'cause if you stay on, you're in for the ride of you're life. And with A Storm of Swords, that's exactly what you'll get.
158234082X|5.0|First and foremost, I found the book fun to read.  <br />Many reviewers seemed to note the perversions (food to avoid and foul language/behavior).  Certaintly there are parts, but only one chapter in the book is about things to avoid in a restaurant. Although there is a lot about debauchery, I had read all the Amazon reader reviews before I read the book and couldn't help being reminded about Upton Sinclair's remark about his book _The_Jungle_.  Sinclair had meant to promote socialism, &quot;I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach.&quot;  Unfortunately, people may remember this book as they do _The_Jungle_, about food abuse.<br />If I analyze the &quot;meaning&quot; of the book for me(presumptiously), I took the book as a microcosm of human endeavor, the quest for perfection (in some sense) and the road travelled to get there, ultimately (perhaps) being happy with what one accomplishes. Taking risk, bad bosses, quitting, co-workers, new jobs and the meaning of life are given in a sort of series of stories.
B000002O51|5.0|I'll never forget walking into a record store in Lake Havasu, Arizona as I waited for the mechanic to finish my oil change and spotted what I was certain was a hallucination...a brand new Boston album!  I had heard rumors for YEARS they were recording a new record, but c'mon!  How many times can you keep hearing the same 'rumor' and STILL believe it?  I was beginning to believe that Boston was finished as a group...but there it was, right in front of me!  'Third Stage' made its debut in October of 1986...and as I sat there looking at the display at the store I suddenly realized something truly shocking to me: I was FLAT BROKE.  Talk about a monumental paradox.  I wasn't about to steal it, so it was a while before I was able to actually buy it and savor my first taste of one of my favorite bands after so many years of listening and re-listening to their first two albums.<br />Let's leap-frog ahead a few years...I am now in radio and I manage to actually get PAID to have fun and listen to music I love (including Boston...) and I STILL love this CD.  Is it as good as their first release?  No WAY!  But is it a great CD??? Without A DOUBT.  Each track has something to offer in its own way and I have to hand it to Dave for doing such a great job on the arrangements and anyone who doesn't view Brad Delp as easily one of THE GREATEST Rock &amp; Roll singers has got rocks for brains! Talk about a crisp and clean voice with a range that would make Pavarotti jealous...just check out 'Cool The Engines', 'We're Ready' and 'Can'tcha Say (You Believe In Me)' great stand-out tracks aside from the incredible radio airplay of 'Amanda', which is a superior song, but not necessarily MY personal favorite on the record.  Sure these guys take a LOOOOOOOOONG time in-between album releases, but if that's what it takes to produce an incredible album like 'Third Stage' I anxiously await the next release sometime just before Haley's Comet reaches earth again...<br />HIGHLY recommended.
1556154844|5.0|I first read Steve McConnell's book on Code Construction whilst working in the US in 1996 and I am still amazed at the continuing relevance of the book in the Web/Java era.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who seriously wants to have a carreer in software development.  Whether they are managing a software team or are a lone developer. [Managers: Find out what your team really needs to write good code! And it aint just free cola.]<br />In my opinion even hobbyists can benefit from McConnells approaches to writing coherent code described in this book.<br />It has pride of place on my bookshelf next to his other book &quot;Rapid Development: Taming Wild Software Schedules&quot;.<br />This book, however, is a far more enjoyable read and gives a great insight into how 'real-world' programmers should function.<br />Ah well. Not much more I can say on this book other than,  If you aint got it get it!<br />martin ;-)
B000002572|5.0|What can I say about one THE greatest albums of all-time?  Boston has given us one of those rare treats in the world of music: a record where you don't have to worry about skipping over those 'lesser' songs because they aren't as good...nope, each and every song in this collection is like a 'best of' CD all by itself where ALL of the songs are stand outs.  Don't believe me?  Check out 'Peace of Mind' or 'Smokin', 'Something About You', 'Let Me Take You Home Tonight' or arguably Bostons all-time best song(s): 'Foreplay/Long Time'.  This CD speaks volumes about how every band ought to release their first record.<br />Now I have to admit that Boston was never able to even come close to the amazing success they garnered with their first album...but aside from their 4th record, you know, the only one without Brad Delp on lead vocals (a truly superior mistake on Dave's part to even release a record without Brad...) I enjoy each of Boston's CD's (especially 'Third Stage' no matter WHAT the critics say). Trust me when I tell you that I am SO VERY LUCKY because I am in radio and I get PAID to listen to music (it really IS a great job) but that isn't all: I also GET to go to concerts for FREE and I was fortunate to see Boston many years ago when they toured to promote 'Third Stage' (I don't say this to brag, I just want you to know just how lucky I really am) and while they were unable to (in my opinion) duplicate the sound they produced on their recordings (they were able to fine-tune in a studio what you just can't do on stage in front of an audience) they sure were a great group of guys.  Brad, believe it or not, is actually pretty shy, but boy does he open up in front of a crowd. Dave was quiet, but chimed in when he had an opinion, and when I asked them about the success of their first album, they were STILL amazed at how it literally shot into the orbit of a true phenomenon, very humble in their success--which is pretty rare among the super-groups that I have met.<br />If you are just getting to know Boston, THIS is most definitely THE album to grab.  Also, 'Don't Look Back' (not given nearly the respect it deserves) and of course my 2nd fav, 'Third Stage' these guys are truly in a class by themselves.  My HIGHEST recommendation./>If you are just getting to know Boston, THIS is most definitely THE album to grab.

B000001ESJ|5.0|In another review of Rush's \\"2112\\" album, I remarked that it was the best album ever. This album gives me pause when I say that, however.<br /><br />While it provided the band with my least favorite Rush song (thanks to too many repetitions of so-called-metal radio stations) and one of their biggest hits, it also is chock with all manner of other incredible songs.<br /><br />Three songs- A Farewell to Kings, Xanadu, and Cygnus X-1 provide enough musical epic-ness to soothe the hardcore Sci-Fi/Fantasy beast within anyone. Odd time signatures and the vastness of the subject matter coupled with the way the music supports the lyrics make this album hard to beat in the Rush lexicon.<br /><br />Still, if you are one to buy an album for only one song (which would be a misread in this case) Cygnus X-1 is undoubtedly the best treatment of a song about space as is possible in my mind.<br /><br />While I like \\"I, Mother Earth\\"'s \\"One More Astronaut\\", that song is more about the astronaut, and Cygnus X-1 is about the ship, it's captain, and the space it moves through. Simply astounding. What is also amazing is that they can do this song live without a hitch with the odd time signature at the beginning.  I am not yet a musician, so maybe it's easy musically to figure that out- but still after 15+ years of listening to this song- I still am blown away by it.<br /><br />On another note, anyone who has ever read the \\"Space Lord\\" comic book by John Byrne, should listen to this song or vice versa.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a perpetual toss-up for me between 2112 (which is not as accessible as this album), A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Grace Under Pressure (for different reasons) and Moving Pictures, as far as favorites go.

This video is a must for major Bon Jovi fans, and is a clear display of what it takes to make it in the music indistry today. Gon bless Rock &amp; roll, and thanks for Bon Jovi. -Ryan
B00000K0T8|5.0|this album is wu-tang music at it's zenith. if you are a fan of the Wu then you should have this album and if not then you're either not a fan or you were born sometime after this album's release.
B00004XONN|4.0|The debate has been raging long and hard since Kid A's release: have Radiohead lost it, or is the new album a work of misunderstood genius? Is Kid A a deconstructed narrative of twenty first century displacement or just an excuse not to write any tunes? Analysis upon overanalysis - though Radiohead should take it as a compliment that people are getting so worked up about them. It is the surest sign that they have become huge.  I think the (inevitable) mistake people have made in trying to quantify this album is in comparing it to Radiohead's previous masterpiece OK Computer (and to a lesser extent The Bends). Kid A is something completely different from what has gone before, and comparing the two things is like comparing Thom's lyrics to his artwork - the same reference points cannot be used. Where OK Computer took traditional songwriting to its extreme and logical conclusion, Kid A ignores traditional songwriting almost altogether. The rapid evolution of digital technology has seen a significant change in the way musicians are now working. Where 5 years ago most songwriters were still sitting down with an acoustic guitar in their hands and a chord arrangement in their heads, now many more are sitting in front of a computer with an open mind. Most reviewers have rightly pointed out that there is much less in the way of melody on Kid A than in earlier Radiohead material. Melody is often what gives a song its characteristic flavour. It's what the majority want - something to hum along to - and there's nothing wrong with that. On listening to Kid A at times it is hard to identify exactly which track you're listening to. But take the whole as a whole, rather than chop it up into tracks, and the worth of Kid A starts to become apparent. It is a sort of virus that seeps through your skin and into your bloodstream, and remains dormant in your system for a while. At first you fail to comprehend and thus with each repeated listen find yourself striving for appreciation. Thengradually Radiohead's subtle skills start to work on your subconscious: the atmosphere is key, and it is not something new. A creeping feeling of paranoia, alienation, despair. Thom, even in this minimalist mode, strikes a lyrical chord with the disenchanted that few have ever been able to match. Even if his meanings are often ambiguous and elusive, the keen Radiohead fan has been able to sense what he's driving at. Kid A throws up some interesting soundbites: &quot;this isn't happening&quot;, &quot;ice age coming&quot;, &quot;I'm lost at sea&quot;, \\"the big fish eat the little ones\\", \\"you're living in a fantasy\\". The man doesn't need to say much to get his message across. And while on this collection the band has eschewed the verse chorus verse blueprint, it merely means that the listener will have to remain a little more open minded and work a little harder to get their reward - and often the things we have to work hardest for are the most rewarding.  While America embraced Kid A's arrival with open arms, the English music press generally greeted it with confusion, dismay and even scorn. Opinions will have changed in a year. This is not bubblegum pop or easy listening trad rock. It is not purveyed by talentless talent school kids from Gap adverts, or pseudo-disfunctional egotists in big shorts shouting barely coherent threats. There is no instant dividend on offer. But those with the patience and taste to appreciate a work of ambition and originality, of feeling and intellect, will be won over. When have Radiohead ever let us down?
B000000OUJ|5.0|the only reason you don't like GZA is because you cannot understand him which would make you a dummy. it is not GZA's fault that his lyrics are too complex for your little brain so why don't you just be quiet!!
0060922583|4.0|I'll make this short.  Michael Talbot does a credible job of drawing parallels between religious concepts from different traditions and some of the basic ideas proposed by the field of quantum physics.  The provocative nature of his subject matter is a call for us all to go deeper into an inquiry about what it truly means to be human.  We are also well advised to explore more deeply what our responsiblities are as caretakers of this planet. The author seems to suggest that our best hope for survival lies in the development of our faculties of visualization.  Not only is Talbot's conclusion about this comforting; it also cries out for further exploration by anyone who thinks and occupies a physical body.  Skeptics and zealots may balk, but the fact remains that creativity flows most freely from an open mind.  If this book can inspire even a single person open up to greater possiblities, then this author and others need to keep generating a steady stream of this kind of material (especially since Talbot researched his information so meticulously).
B00000JPH5|4.0|I love the work of Jim Henson. I enjoy watching the movies and television programs he produced and directed because he was a great film maker and puppeteer.  Many of his creations are loveable and some are stunning. However, the main reason I love the work of Jim Henson is because he was a great storyteller who he knew how to tell fairy tales right.<br />Most people today get their idea of fairy tales from the watered down Disney variety. As much as I enjoy Disney films, it is sad that the true stories are being lost. Sadder still is that if people were to actully listen to and read fairy tales in the way they were meant to be listened to and read, the storyteller would be accused of being a sick and violent person (even though the society we live in is much more sick and violent).<br />Jim Henson was not afraid of telling a story in the way it was meant to be told.  Jim Henson told fairy tales the right way.  Such is the case in LABYRINTH.<br />LABYRINTH is sort of a modern day fairy tale. Sarah is selfish and doesn't want to babysit her crying baby brother. So, she wishes for the goblins to take him away. Did anyone ever tell you to be careful for what you wish for because it might come true? Well, that's just what happens here. The goblins steal Sarah's brother, Toby, and take him to the castle in the goblin city. Sarah can save her brother, but only if she can successfuly navigate the labyrinth that leads to the city in a short amount of time.  Sarah begins the quest and in doing so meets up with several loveable, frightening, and confusing creatures.  They have several adventures which ultimately lead to Sarah's confrontation with the Goblin King.<br />LABYRINTH is a delightful fairy tale adventure. It has scary monsters, a fight against evil, and a moral lesson.  Children will enjoy watching it. However, I think adults may enjoy it even more because they will understand the parrell between the &quot;fantasy world&quot; and Sarah's (and perhaps your own) real life.life.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I have to admit that I wasn't very excited about this album when I got it for Christmas, but after listening to it a few times, I've become a Beatles fan all over again. If, like me, you got rid of your old Beatles albums years ago, this is a great way to get reacquainted with some great music!
B00003CX8J|5.0|With the exception of the Original Superman movie, I have been very disappointed in the movie adaptations of comic books heroes.  I have NO disappointment with the X-Men movie.  <br />Fast paced, but explains allot, lots of action and an excellent story.  The extras on the DVD are fantastic.<br />Buy it....you will not be disappointed.
6305897786|3.0|I'd say that all reviewers of this movie can be divided into two groups: the ones who've read the book by A. Perres-Riverte &quot;The Dumas Club&quot;, on which the script is based, and those, who haven't.<br />I belong to the first group. That's my pride and my bad luck at once. For if you've NOT READ the book, this creation by R Polansky might seem rather decent and thrilling: a detective-bibliophile (J Depp) hired by another rich book-collector to find a book presumingly written by Satan. Line of deaths follow J Depp's search and he also acquires a mysterious girl friend that can be out-of-this-world herself. J Depp fits into this part very well (angular lupine features, black-rimmed glasses, thin moustache). The music is menacingly demonic. There are no cheap x-effects or grotesque demons, a nice plot-twist at the end and on the whole it can be called &quot;an intellectual thriller&quot;.<br />However, if you HAVE READ the book, the poor plot of the movie can't be even compared with a subtle puzzle of two sub-plots of the book (the Satanist one and the Dumas one) that hold your attention till the last pages, tons of information provided on ancient books, their authors and culture of collecting books, as well as on A Dumas, &quot;the Three Musketeers&quot; and their prototypes.<br />I advise you: 1) Watch this movie 2) Read the wonderful book 3) See for yourself how, for the hundredth time, a good book turned into a mediocre script as a victim for Director's ambition &quot;to please everyone&quot; and not to burden the audience with &quot;intellectual ballast&quot;. What a pity...
B000051VWW|5.0|I usually have to listen to a CD 4 or 5 times before I really get into it.  I have become mesmerized by this CD since the first time listening to it.  It is as therapeutically relaxing as a good massage or a nice smelling candle.
0375500901|4.0|See storyline above.<br />I think Daniel Silva has done it again. Written a gripping and serious spy novel, that is. Although not as intense as his previous novels, The Kill Artist takes a top seat in the international spy genre. This international thriller, with well molded characters, will take you all the way from the Mideast to Paris and from London to Canada. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the main player in this book and Daniel Silva knows this topic well. The only problem I had with the book was the lack of gut wretching suspense that I come to expect with this type of novel (I guess I expected Ludlum). Still, a good spy novel with great characters and timely subjects, gives this one a high mark.<br />highly recommended for the serious international thriller fan.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you are Beatles fan you know that most of the revolutionary stuff is not on this album.( Like St. Pepper)  My friend who listened say that none of the good stuff is on this CD.  Beatles fans know that every Beatles song is unique in itself and like a little peice of art in a museum, you look at  not because it's expensive or trendy. You look at it because you like the way it looks to YOU.  The Beatles music is kind of like that.  Everyone finds something different in every song.    I like all the songs on this CD.  Only one of the best bands to come along and redefine rock n' roll and in most cases invent a whole new way of listening to it.   When you listen ,  you can hear all the different facets of their songwriting talent.  I'm not from the Beatles generation, more like born during it,  but this is one of the best  because it does bring all the number 1's together along with the range of talent they had.   I will say this though.  A song doesn't have to be number 1 to be great and they sure had alot of great songs.
0385484518|5.0|As a little kid it was the end of the world to lose a favorite toy, but as time went by and maturity kicked in, it was learned that there was much more to life than such trivial things.  More than losing a toy, the loss of a loved one is something that is remembered rather than a petty toy.  Tuesdays with Morrie is an excellent book that one can easily relate to if they have experienced any kind of life-altering loss in their life.  Teaching insightful lessons chapter after chapter, it is not just another sob story intended for readers to feel sympathy or pity, but someone's personal experience written for readers in need of some inspiration in their life.  As the narrator, Mitch, goes through life, it is apparent on how he is changed by reuniting with Morrie, his old college professor who now has Lou Gherig's Disease.  The compassion that is built for Morrie makes it devastating when it is time to say good-bye to him.  Through all the pains and struggles that Morrie endured, the most important lesson learned is to never give up, let it be on yourself or other people.  This book is recommended for those who have experienced a lot in their life.  People who have not experienced much in life may not like this book because they might not be able to relate to the situations.

This film is what all other anime should look up to.  Not meant for kids (because of a few rape scenes).  If you are new to anime this is a MUST SEE.

B00004WEJZ|3.0|As some of the reviews here note, there is a large piece of missing footage on this DVD between chapters 19 &amp; 20 (when the disc changes layers). Is yours missing footage? Here's how to check. Start at chapter 19 and follow Bond as he gate crashes the Casino and sticks the bouncer in the closet. If your DVD jumps from Bond leaving the bouncer in the closet with the &quot;bomb&quot; in his hand (Bond says,&quot;Good boy&quot;), to a scene inside the casino where Bond, Domino, and Largo enter the private game room (Largo saying, &quot;These are my friends...&quot;), then you've got a dud. What you should have seen is Bond going from the bouncer in the closet -- to a shot of Bond through the casino door peep hole -- he enters casino -- sticks gun in ice bucket -- enters video game room -- meets Domino (&quot;My name is Bond, James Bond&quot;) -- meets Largo, etc. If yours is defective (and many of them where) the good news is you can return it and get a replacement DVD by calling MGMÕs customer service dept at 1-877-MGM-4YOU (or emailing them at 4you@mgm.com) and following their instructions. I did this and I now have a new, complete NSNA DVD.
6302824729|5.0|Karate Kid II is not only the best of the series, it is a premier movie of the eighties. In the beginning it was only made to build upon the successful sequel theory, but this film was part of a greater movement;  Kid II was instrumental in the popular acceptance of &quot;Eastern&quot; culture. For Asian-American children, it provided a springboard into popular white society and created a mystique and awe about anything Asian.  For some, respect grew from the disciplined culture that was eloquently protrayed throughout Kid II. For many others, Asians were again equivocated with martial arts and respected for an element of the eyes.   No matter what the initial reasonings for acceptance or respect, it did lead to a general perception that Asian culture was something to be admired and that if cross-bred with American culture, there could be a tremendously successful result. Karate Kid II plays on all the emotions of American capacity and is both sad and inspiring. If an editor chooses to dismiss any piece as only &quot;for kids,&quot; then unfortunately his narrow sightedness will never allow him to write an article worth reading. Buy it. Watch it. Take it to heart.
0061002747|4.0|In Murder on the Orient Express, Agatha Christie does a phenomenal job at gluing the eyes of the reader to the pages of her book.  This &quot;who dunnit?&quot; is about a detective, Hercule Poirot who is on a train when an infamous mobster is murdered.  Poirot takes the case and is determined to catch the killer.  Everyone on the train is a suspect.  Christie's work is brimming  with imagery and details that keep the reader captivated.  She draws a meticulous picture in the reader's mind of each character by portraying the appearance, personality, and voice through her book.  For example, one of the characters is a fat Italian man who has a thick accent and has a habit of gesticulating with his toothpick after he has removed it from his mouth. Many  of the expressions and words that she selected are so humorous, I found myself smiling every few minutes.  However, I did not like the fact that she uses French expressions in the story.  Who knows what, &quot;Voil ce qui est embetant,&quot; means?  I did not have the slightest clue what was being said.  Another aspect of the book I didn't like was the fact that many of the clues in the story were written in italics and were easy to point out.  This made the story seem rather predictable to an extent.  However, one would have never guessed the surprise ending.  Although thecrime story was ingeniously thought out, I didn't think the structure of the book was.  Each chapter was dedicated in interviewing a certain passenger on the train.  I found it  tedious boring because I anticipated what would happen in the next chapter.  Despite this, each chapter leaves the reader hanging and lures him or her to read ahead.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read mystery books that aren't too scary or violent.  This is a murder mystery that will  not give the reader nightmares!  I also think that people who are entertained by humor will enjoy this book.  However, those who like reading books that just get down to thevital facts, skipping over details and imagery will not find this book very fascinating.  I urge everyone to try to experience the  book because I truly believe that Agatha Christie has done a praise worthy job on it.  As said in the end of the book, &quot;I made one fantastic suggestion.&quot;
B000002BYD|4.0|Remember when Vitalogy or No code came out and no one bought them because no songs sounded like Jeremy, Alive Etc? Because of those albums (Vitalogy is excellent, and i've never heard No Code) everyone stopped caring. Now, on thier don't-call-it-a-comeback-album Yield they try to be America's Favorite Rock Band again, but still have the originalty found on Vitalogy. The album opens up with Mike counting off, screwing up and restaring, for sort of a garage feel. The first song then starts, and is one of the hardest fastest rocker by Pearl Jam in a while, until it gets to the cool slow part and then speeds back up again. And as the chords of Brain of J(FK) fade out, in comes a drum intro to Faithful, an upbeat song that starts out as soft rock and progresses into a laid back rocker. No Way is blusier than most Pearl Jam songs and features the cryptic lyrics of rythem guitarist Stone Gossard. When Eddie (excuse me, Ed) sings he's not trying to make a difference, I doubt that, but the song is cool. Given To Fly &quot;borrows&quot; the melody from a Led Zepplin song, but Pearl Jam have been one of the most original bands of the ninties so one is understandable. Besides, the song is extremelly catchy. Wishlist is the ballad song Pearl Jam always seem to have. It contains equal parts Nothingman, Betterman, and Daughter. It also contains really sappy lyrics about Ed wishing for stuff. Weird stuff like being an alien, a keychain, a verb, a brake pedal, and a neutron bomb. Why, I don't know, but the song is good and features some nice guitar work from Mike and Stone. Pilate is a wierd one, starting out like Wishlist, and then getting a little louder for the chorus. The spoken word part in the backround is sorta corny, but the rest of the song is cathy. Do the Eveloution is another straight foward hard rock song which features Ed screaming IT'S EVELOUTION BABY louder each time as the sloppy guitars get louder and more chaotic.  Then, about halfway through the song, a choir starts singing Hallelujah. I guess it adds to the effect of the lyrics. Untitled (Red Dot, The Color Red) reminds me of Pry, To from Vitalogy. It;s Mostly drums courtosey of Ex-Chili Pepper Jack Irons, and Ed chanting We're all crazy. MFC is cool, fast, yet kind of quiet and held back until the chorus which sounds a lot like the chorus of Last Exit. Low Light is an accoustic ballad, quiet and suprisingly up-tempo (fast). In Hiding is pretty good, sounds like MFC's little brother, not quiet as loud though. Push Me Pull Me is Yield's inevitible experiment. Eddie talks through most of it and it is mostly some weird sounds with some guitar work all mixed in. All those yestarday's is one of the best songs by Pearl Jam yet. Sounding a lot like the Beetles, it features Eddie singing, in third person, about being a rock star and being sick of it, not in the infamous &quot;Grammy Speach&quot; kill all coorparate rock way, but more like he is just tired of everything and wishes he were a regular person. You sure can Eddie, but the millions of doallars are gunna have to go to.
B00000064G|5.0|Drake's guitar and vocals are simple, serene, warm, and haunting.  Drake is at his best here, without all the string-section background fillers.  It's instantly become one of my favorites.
B00000DHRX|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I had only took my sister's cds and then listened to it. When I listened to both cds, I was truly amazed at the songs GM sang. However, I am not a GM fan.<br />George Michael, in my opinion, has a really beautiful voice and sings some of the most excellent songs in the world. I come from that so called &quot;generation&quot; of grunge and stuff, but hey, it's a free country.  <br />The first cd, For the Heart, I think has a lot of soulful ballads. One of my favorites is Praying for Time which I think is very true, the world can be so selfish. I also liked Heal the Pain which I found very smooth as well as Father Figure which I think is also very meaningful. Careless Whisper is still one of my most favorites with the music and the lyrics well fitted.<br />The second cd is the one that I liked most. I liked Faith, it got me tapping automatically and it's very addictive. Also, I liked Freedom 90 which is another great song which I think has great lyrics. The media can be so mean, I guess. Too Funky is excellent for the catwalk and I Knew You Were Waiting for Me has great lyrics and music.<br />In the end, I think this is an excellent album with GM's greatest hits and songs. However, I didn't like the Asian version which didn't have Monkey. The US version is my favorite. Buy this album whether you are a fan of GM or a collector of songs.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|On any level this is great value - 27 classic hits for less than $14.00. And lets face it, these are all songs that will endure forever. Yes, most of us old baby boomers already own this material ( some of it on Vinyl I am afraid to say) but what a great way to get them all on one CD. This is a great investment -you will own a vivid description of how popular music evolved over a ten year period, and how the Beatles contribution to 20th century music changed the world. Hey - a lot of these songs would be great hits if they were released for the first time today Buy it !
B000022TSV|5.0|The performances are great and the music has seldom sounded better, especially in the sections where the chorus is featured.  It's hard to imagine an opera heroine who is actually sexy in a roll, but Julia Migenes-Johnson pulls it off with ease.  Lest you think this is merely a sexist remark, lt me point out that the greatest divas must also be great actresses, too...  Callas being a memorable case in point.  The visuals and cinematography make this a total veiwing pleasure.  It may well be the greatest opera done as movie ever!
630414542X|3.0|Ive never seen so many reviews for a movie that are almost entirely about the DVD audio and video quality.  I remember seeing the movie when I was younger, and remeber likeing it, so I rented this movie the other day (for my VCR).I just don't see what is so special about this movie.  It is a very cool story, I like how they go back to Scotland, and is a decent fantasy story overall but I would say that its somewhat dated. It was a little confusing as well.  Lambert was a good hero, but overall I thought it was a little cheezy.  That car scene at the end was pretty stupid.  Why did the bad guy have to bring that girl all the way to the abandon factory?  That last fight scene was pretty bad.  I don't know, I wanted to like this movie, and I think I did when I was 13, but seeing it now, it just didn't impress me.  I gave it 3 stars for the cool story, and for Connery.
B00000JY1X|5.0|I bought this at the suggestion of a friend who simply told me I'd love it.  They were right.  I have one disc in my computer, one in the player in the bathroom, and the third in my bedroom.  I don't want to listen to anything else, and this is going on three weeks.  Great lyrics, wonderful melodies.  Buy it!
B000000WZ4|4.0|Ultra is definitely not a bad DM album. It has really deep lyrics and the feel of the music fits the lyrics very nicely. However, I miss the old DM and I sure miss Alan Wilder whom I think had given some more flavor to the band in a way. I am still a DM fan, but this is not my favorite.<br />What part of originality it lacked was the fact that in some areas, the sound is a bit too unoriginal, I didn't like some of the ending tracks. However, I think Barrel of a Gun is not bad. The Love Thieves lacks a little originality but only a bit; but one of my favorites. Home is definitely one of favorites with it's lyrics and music. Although a bit more mainstream, it still is quite different from others. I miss the old Synth type of style they used like in the album Black Celebration.<br />Not bad and recommended to a DM fan. Be warned that this does not show their roots. For a newbie, pick up the Singles or some of their earlier albums, this is definitely not the same DM as the one before.
B00000K19E|5.0|I keep watching this movie ..something I never usually do.  The story line is very clever and there are echoes of many devices used in some great literary classics, (Lewis Carrol fans should love it).  The special effects are stunning but you must watch it on DVD to savor them to their full effect. Even Keanu Reeves looks good in this !! This movie will become a SciFi classic very quickly -  buy it --satisfaction guaranteed

0679879269|5.0|If you're looking for a shocking work of art that will blend new ideas with old in a fresh way, this is definitely an excellent book to start with.  Philip Pullman takes the classic battle between good and evil that shows up in about every book, and switches elements just enough to keep the reader guessing.  This book ought to be enjoyable to any audience, due to its rich layers.  Children will love the protaganists Lyra and Will and the fast-paced adventure; young adults will love the melodramatic ending; theologians will find Pullman's ideas about life and death extremely thought-provoking; and those of us fixated on imagery and deeper meaning will find an ample supply with this novel.  <br />I can't believe people are making a fuss over Harry Potter being banned and no one has made a fuss over this book's unique look at God at all.  <br />It's useless to compare this series to another &quot;fantasy&quot; series; it's actually quite unlike anything I've read.
B00004XONN|5.0|The fantastic lyricism of this piece of art is, at first listening, submerged within the liquid texture of layered keyboards, strange combinations of special effects and technological inventions that give the CD a sort of experimental, science-fiction edge. After repeated listening, the true essence of the CD finally comes out, and shines. Like in OK computer the melodies are complex and deep, the voice is a harsh soprano-sax ranting hopeless, desperately romantic anthems. At some points the emotionality is highest than ever, like in 'How to disappear', when, almost in trance, he shout repeatedly &quot;I'm not here! I'm not here!&quot;, or in the refrain &quot;You try the best you can...the best you can is not enough&quot;, one of the most moving moments of music I ever listened. Or again in &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, another entrancing piece that grab you with such intensity that force you to listen over and over again until...you are exhausted. This CD is an emotional tour de force, as I rarely remember.   About the comparison with their previous CD, they might have dressed the same songs with usual art-rock guitar-driven arrangements, and still obtain great songs, and have a product within the same spirit of OK computer. Instead, they opted for a very unexpected but interesting keyboard sound, that submerges the lyrics in a sort of liquid substance, creating a even more dramatic, desperating resonance. Singing on top of scratched guitar chords is like shouting from the peak of a mountain, everybody see you and listen. In Kid A, instead, they sing in the water, or in the vacuum, may be. They sing and cry, and get lost in the deep water of keyboards, and you can't hear them, unless you don't submerge yourself.   Although I also love their previous CD, I definitely consider Kid A the Radiohead grand opera. In the era of pop crap, thanks God, at least we have Radiohead.
B00000DG1R|4.0|Greatest is definitely the title that fits what this album is. It is after all, a compilation of their greatest songs.<br />It's kind of amazing however at how Duran Duran's music style changes over time. It was as if they were going more psychedelic in their later years, but still it does have quite a nice feel.<br />Lyrically, I think Duran Duran really need to improve on that. Their lyrics are totally meaningless, nearly like the Beatles in a sense that they were also meaningless in most songs. But, they have excellent music which I enjoyed. It's so mainstream that it's likeable in a way. Some of my favorites are The Reflex, New Moon on Monday, Is there Something I Should Know, Rio, and also Hungry Like the Wolf. Great music.<br />Overall, Duran Duran has some of the most excellent music I've ever heard, but I can only give them 4 stars due to the bad lyrics and the fact that the CD cover layout get's confusing though I admit it looks pretty good.
630522577X|5.0|but this one deserves them! This is probably the only movie that I could watch each night, and still laugh like crazy and sing along the tunes.<br />Based on G. B. Shaw's novel &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; is a musical that had a great success on Broadway, before George Cukor masterfully filmed it. All the actors, with no exception, are extraordinary. I would like to point out Rex Harrison's (aka prof. Henry Higgins) fantastic expressiveness, in every movement of his body and face.<br />You can tell the actors are doing a wonderful job, when you watch it for the 10th time, when you put each detail under the microscope of your hightened attention. You will notice that you have to laugh even harder, and that you have more and more fun each time you watch it.<br />The songs are beautiful and funny at the same time. Before you'll notice, you will be singing &quot;Lots o' chock'lit for me to eat...&quot;, &quot;Just you wait 'enry 'iggins&quot; and &quot;The rain in Spain...&quot; and many others that will move forever in your heart and memories.<br />The DVD contains a full-lenght commentary packed with interesting details on the actors, the making, etc., and the singing voice of Eliza Doolittle (masterfully played by Audrie Hepburn), Marni Nixon, talks about some behind-the-scene events that I sure wasn't aware of. There is also a featurette and a very nice &quot;Making of..&quot; included.<br />Considered how much joy this movie brought to my family and me, this was the best purchase so far. What are you still waiting? Buy this gem, run!
0800105141|5.0|Every parent should show their teenage child this movie.  It is a movie about what one person achieved during their life.  It motivates one by showing step by step in each scene how great accomplishments are made.<br />Gandhi's work motivated and is still motivating many of the great leaders of the past and present century.  The struggles of his life humbles the viewer.  His awareness of his destiny gradually overtakes him and those around him.<br />Richard Attenborough did the world a great service in bringing this story to film.  Young adults can learn not only how to weave thread (as one of the everyday chores of life) but also how to dream great dreams and make them come true.  GANDHI is a video textbook on how it is done.
B0000042H4|4.0|Wagner is excellent, and this is surely a well-written piece, but do not plan on listening to this in a single evening. The whole opera is many, many hours long, and it can be exhausting. However, the music is often worth the sheer effort it takes to listen to. Even the average listener will recognize &quot;The March of the Valkyries&quot; and some of the other more famed pieces. However, if the thought of devoting hours and hours of time to listening to a single piece daunts you, I would suggest the album &quot;Opera - Wagner: Ring of Nibelungen (Highlights) / Haitink&quot;. Also good for understanding the 'Ring' is an explanation by Anna Russell on &quot;The Anna Russell Album&quot;. She is extraordinarily witty and makes the sometimes obtuse opera plot understandable. All in all, a great piece.
B000002L9M|5.0|Wow! I just couldn't believe it when I listened to the songs from this album. I don't own the album but this album is really impressive! I had never listened to synth in a very dark mood like this. The songs are gripping!<br />Although I thought A Question of Time was a bit annoying and A Question of Lust a bit slow for my taste, I mainly liked the songs New Dress and Stripped. In my opinion, I think in Stripped, Dave has a really beautiful voice as well as haunting. In New Dress, I like the lyrics a lot. Black Celebration is pretty good too.<br />So is this album worth buying? Sure, it's very good.
0688002307|5.0|ZMM is the best book I have ever read, but it took some effort to get through. I actually picked it up several times based on the reviews of it given to me by other people, however each time I was bored within minutes and didn't get 20 pages into the book.    I finally gave to book a real try on a lazy saturday Afternoon and found that the book truley is not about motorcycles but about a man's search for himself, about the difference in understanding, about what is real, about what is truth.    While many say it is a book about philosophy and some look to it for this insight, I found that it is really a book about finding one's own understanding of the world.    While the beautifull discriptions of the countryside and the trip may seem dull at times, they truly underline the journey of mind and enlightenment that is the purpose behind this book.
0767840135|5.0|I've seen 4 Cirque shows live: Quidam, Mystere, O, and Dralion.  Quidam is my favorite.  This DVD captures Quidam nicely, although it's no substitute to seeing them in the big tent.  Buy the DVD, get the CD, then try to catch the Quidam travelling tour.
B00004XSUW|5.0|Taj's first was one of his best.  This is just basic electric blues, powered by the fresh enthusiasm of Taj, Ry Cooder, the now departed Jessie Ed Davis on lead guitar, and other young bucks.  The Allman Brothers used Taj's arrangement of \\"Statesboro Blues\\" for their live version -- I wonder how many Allmans fans realize that?<br /><br />This album has the energy, punch and optimism that filled the air in 1967.  It fits perfectly with the first, self-titled album by Chicago's Butterfield Blues Band, and with [[ASIN:B00000JY8D the self-titled album by Chicago's Siegel-Schwall Band released by Wooden Nickel in 1971]] (see my review).  These albums still sound fresh today!<br /><br /> The only Taj Mahal album I love more than this one is [[ASIN:B001PCOT04 HAPPY JUST TO BE LIKE I AM]], from 1971, which has more of a country-blues emphasis, along with an awesome horn section and Taj's first foray into world-music with \\"West Indian Revelation.\\"  It was reissued by Wounded Bird Records in 2009, but now seems to be available only in MP3 form.
B000001DTM|5.0|It all started when I listened to Mysterious Ways about more than five years back. I had grown very addicted to that song but never had a chance again after '93. Later, back in '00, I downloaded the mp3 for this song and got addicted all over again!<br />This is the story of why I got this album but there's more. Although I thought Zoo Station and Even Better Than the Real Thing sound a bit the same, I liked them and the rest of the songs. Mysterious Ways still gives me that wild impulse to dance and I liked Ultra Violet's music. One has great lyrics and Acrobat as well. I also liked Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around the World which I think is pretty nice if you play it in a coffee shop. <br />Although not a U2 fan, I like this album and the music a lot.
630476524X|3.0|It's really starting to piss me off that people give this movie such a bad rap. I think that its great! Given, its nowhere near as good as the first one, but the first Crow is just a classic. It can't be beaten. But this movie is still good. Its not near as emotional in the first one. In the first one, you actually felt sorry for the characters, but in City of Angels, the plot is to just kill people. Not like thats a bad thing though. The lighting effects are really cool. Los Angelas is shrouded in a badass looking green fog.<br />Ash and his son are murdered by a gang of thugs after they witness a murder. The crow comes and brings Ash back to &quot;set the wrong things right&quot;.
B000002URV|5.0|The CD came out in 1990, and it took me all of two years to just break down and buy it. I must admit that I love this CD. It is the only of my collection of hundreds that I listen to faitfully. I am not a fan of Enigma, and haven't really bought anything by them before or after this CD. But I give credit where credit is due. The CD is sensual, (...) and smooth. The passions it can arouse when in the proper state of mind is phenomenal. I have been tempted to purchase othe releases by them just to see if the others have the same feel to it as this one.<br />I would recommend listening to this CD at night, when you are in the mood to relax, or when you and your mate are feeling amorous, and don't mind a musical assist. It's a wonderful album.
B00000064G|5.0|This is a night album. A very late at night album. You are tired and Drake is drifting around your apartment making tea in the kitchen in a bathrobe. His fragile voice, his plaintive moaning. You were ordinary before hearing this record. Now you are captivated.<br />Put it next to  Springsteen's &quot;Nebraska&quot;; any of Dylan's early stuff; Billy Bragg's first three records; Woody Guthrie. Nick Drake stands very tall with these guys.<br />The VW commercial seems to get some note in these reviews and I have to say that I was surprised to find a song that I loved treated with a kind of reverence. No dialogue in the VW spot (good idea). I don't know if it sold any cars, but I like watching it anyhow. At least it was tasteful.<br />Buy this record.

0375501851|5.0|This novel reminded frequently in the beginning as something John Irving might write if he were a little more intelligent and a little less story-driven. All of his themes are there: lust, family, how our past actions forever haunt us, and how time and distance affect our relationships. I initially had very mixed feelings about this book. I began it over Christmas vacation and found the first chapter very intelligent and intriguing, and then my interest slagged a little for the next one hundred pages or so. I found it a little above average, and that was all. But I figured it hadn't been given such good reviews for nothing, and continued. <br />I'm so glad I did. Every evening I read twenty pages or so, and every morning I wake up praying that by some miracle two hundred pages have been tacked on; I am just that engrossed. Never before have I actually not wanted a novel to end. I'm even tempted to go back and read the initial chapters again, hoping that my newfound love for the story will bring insight to what I may have missed before. Other reviewers have said that the book left them wanting more. I feel the same, only in a different sense: write on, Zadie!!<br />(And did anyone else notice that the writing style of the reviewer who disliked 'White Teeth' and praised super-market circulations is ironically similar to that of Zadie Smith's?)
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, is a brilliant novel which traces  the life of a young girl, her family and her friends, while, exploring the  unfortunate racial bias of Maycomb County.  Through her exposure to the  prejudice, the injustice, hopelessness, courage and revenge, she matures to  even the extent of an adult.     This novel centers on the life of a young girl named Scout, her brother  Jem and their friend Dill.  Together, they learn to cope with and fight the  prejudices of their small town.  Throughout their adventure, they meet Boo  Radley, a misinterpreted, kind man who has been locked up in his house for  years as well as Tom Robinson, a black man unjustly convicted guilty for a  crime he could have not committed.  These children mature as they stand up to  the bias and face reality.     In Maycomb County, those who are prejudice make the lives of blacks as  miserable as possible.  Tom Robinson, who was always kind to the Ewells, was  convicted of raping their daughter since he was black, although all evidence  proved he was innocent.  Likewise, others frequently bothered Calpurnia, a  black maid of the Finches, even though she was considered a member, even a  &quot;motherly figure,&quot; to the Finch family.  Because someone is black or  different in other ways, people usually jump to conclusions.  The jury, when  they saw Robinson, convicted him just because of the color of his skin.   Furthermore, Boo Radley, because he was never seen out of his house, was  rumored to be a &quot;monster&quot; even though he was a pleasant guy and even a  lifesaver.  When people jump to conclusions, strength and courage are often  needed for them to withstand those conclusions.  Jem and Scout's father, who  was, until then, considered weak by his children, used his strength and  courage to shoot a rabid animal therefore, bringing out his past of being one  of the greatest gunmen of Maycomb.  Scout, his son, also shows bravery by  approaching some prejudice citizens and even convincing them to abort their  plan to kill Robinson.  Many of these people, through rumors, the color of  their skin or life in general often feel hopeless.  Robinson, after being  convicted felt so unjustified and hopeless that he tried to escape prison and  in conclusion, died.  Dill, a friend of the Finch family, also felt hopeless  when he was unwanted by his mother.  Because of the prejudice, sometimes  revenge feels like he only way out.  Bob Ewell, because of his hatred for  black, tried to frame Robinson, and although Tom was convicted Ewell tried to  kill him.  As revenge towards Ewell, Boo Radley stabbed and killed him.  When  subjected to these prejudices, maturing happens quicker.  Jem, after seeing  the injustice done to Tom Robinson, learns about the cruelty and unfairness  of life, making him more mature then even some of the adults.  Scout also  matures as she stands up to a gang of adults to save the life of her father  and the prisoner and convinces them to leave.     To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the greatest and most well written novels  that, after it has been read, makes the problems of prejudices seem closer to  reality in such a way that anyone can enjoy, no matter how old.
B0000009UX|5.0|I didn't dig this album from EC at first, favoring &quot;Get Happy&quot; as his 'masterpiece?', but the older I got the more I began to appreciate the lyrical strides in this record, not to mention some compelling performances by the Attractions. Production-wise, I don't know how much more fun a vocal can be than the one captured on &quot;Beyond Belief&quot;.<br />EC dons his Sgt. Pepper uniform for this one (&quot;And in Every Home&quot; and its bright trumpet part; Lennon puts his shine on &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; both lyrically and sonically; McCartney brushes up tunes like &quot;You Little Fool&quot;; and I swear George Martin is behind &quot;Town Cryer&quot; and it's subtle outro), but forgive him this indulgence. It's no more than a reverential nod to the Fabs.<br />This record deserves at least two or three spins on your CD player before making a final judgment on it. Don't dismiss it too hastily. It is a fine recording.
0517053616|5.0|I know-I have never read this particular edition of Shakespheare. But I got sick of reading &quot;THIS IS THE WORST BOOK EVER...BORING.&quot;<br />I act Shakespheare. I memorize passages and I savor them. It's boring, huh? Pick it back up-Turn to The Tempest or The Midsummer Night's Dream. Shakespheare even had the guts in Midsummer Night's Dream, the last scene, the &quot;Play Scene&quot; to make fun of himself-some say he may have been even making fun of Romeo and Juliet. The story of Pyramous and Thisbee is awfully similar. Read each speech as a poem. Emphasize stress. Read out loud. Why The Tempest? I picked that-not only because it is a great comedy, but to prove the depth of the characters. Calliban is a monster, a possessive evil, and yes drunken wise man. He shows more sense about his schemes than the two drunks, which fit in perfectly, proving Prospero's power.<br />Shakespheare made mistakes in his plays. Some of them are not good, but there are aprox. 40 of them, so try them. Nevertheless, each mistake has a jewel. I don't particularly think Romeo and Juliet matches the wonderful romance of Trolius and Cressida, but I can't help thinking about Mercutio, the wise man who makes up Queen Mab to mock Romeo, or the nurse who loves marriage so much that she becomes a poor advisor to Juliet. Look carefully-and you will love the characters that do sound clear after 400 years. If you don't beleive me, go out and buy the paperback edition of one of his plays or click to it. You can also view them all online. With that all said, The Riverside is great, and the individual Arden's and Oxford's are great. Get one with footnotes. You don't have to understand every line in order to enjoy the poetry. I don't neccessarily.
0811826848|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  The pictures are well-presented and interesting.  The stories are done in-depth.  I especially enjoyed the detailed review of what happened in Manila, plus all the early background stories and pictures.  It seemed like there was quite a bit of new info there.<br />Hard core Beatles fans get most of their information third or fourth hand from many different, and not so reputible sources and hope it is the truth, but wonder if it is a rumor.  They also covered this in the anthology, but I had read somewhere that Ringo had left during the making of the White Album, but how can you believe what you read??  It was great to hear and read about them discussing these subjects themselves for a change.  <br />One funny personal note.  I usually read laying in bed at night, and when I tried to recline back  and rest the book on my ribs, it was so heavy it made my ribs ache, and I had to sit up.  It really us a humongous volume, not just in size, but in content.
B000000993|5.0|In my opinion this is one of Tools best albums. The sad thing is, nearly no one knows about it. Why is that? This album is a change for Tool from the Opiate album. Undertow is more of a rock approach to Metal. Keenan vocals are the best, Danny Carey is hard to touch on the drums, and best of all, Undertow had Paul D'amour still playing his killer bass riffs. Most people listening to Tool these days, have just heard Justin Chancler rippin up the bass, he's an excellent Bassist, but nothing compared to Justin in my opinion. One other thing I'd like to mention, or ask... How many of you know which is the original cover art for Undertow. The Ribs or the Rat?
B00004VXF2|5.0|He recorded this album to get out of his contract.  This album was nothing more than a finger in the face of his record company.  It has nothing to do with experimentalism.  It was big a &quot;F@#K YOU&quot; to fulfill a record contract and get on with his life.  See it for what it is.  For that alone I will give it 5 stars.  But, people...quit it with this pretentious analysis...you're embarassing, already.
0671004107|5.0|I have read this astounding scientific book by Carl Sagan Contact. It has left me a lot of good impressions about this book. This book is well written and well detailed for many people to read. This book goes over a lot of detail, compared with the movie that came out in the theaters. There are couples of passages in the book that I would like to discuss with everyone. They are as follows: \\"the search for extraterrestrial intelligence-everywhere abbreviated SETI, and except by those who talked somewhat more optimistically about communication with extraterrestrials intelligence (CETI)-was essentially an observing routine, the dull staple for which most of the facility had been built.\\" Page 49, last paragraph. This paragraph talks about the many types of organizations that are designed for searching for extraterrestrials.         In the book Dr. Arroway seems to be very involved in keeping up to date from the sponsors of the program and to see that everything is going as scheduled. She's always trying reach for the things that would seem impossible from other people's perspective. One example would be that she always explores every opinion that he could find before she says that something would not work. My second passage: \\"No Ellie, this is endless. After dozen years you will find no sign of anything. You will argue that another Argue facility has to be built at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars in Australia or in Argentina to observe the southern sky. And when that fails, you'll talk about building some parabolic with a free flying feed in Earth orbit so you can get millimeter waves. You'll always be able to think of some kind of observation that hasn't been done. You'll always intent some explanation about why extraterrestrials like to broadcast where we haven't looked.\\" Page 47, 2nd paragraph.  In this passage it got really interesting for me, because it went to the heart of the story and the goal that the character is trying to achieve by using more sophisticated and more up to date technology than before. In this passage she always looking for someway of improving her observation and never give up in the process no matter how slim the chances are. When Ellie was little girl she was every much interested in electronics, the functionality of different type radio, and also mathematics. As she grew up she got more and more interested in the career in radio astronomy. As she grew up and got her degree she started looking for a way to communicate with the Alien in the universe. The one thing that I like about this book was the strength of the character in the story, and her ability to push herself to the edge, and try every option that she could think of before going on to the next phase. For my final passage from the book, it talks about one of the most frequent conversation the Dr. Arroway has with the collogues at the work place: \\"there's a chance that dozen of additional dishes might be added to the Very Large Array, and make it into a dedicated SETI observatory. They'd do some of the usual kind of radio Astronomy also; of course, it would be a superb interferometer.\\" Page 50. 2nd paragraph. In this passage it talks about the project named SETI, and how it's developing among the scientific community.         In this book it talks about the way SETI would help the community and be able to profit the research for scanning the skies for radio signal that some life form would be broadcasting to the other planets. In this story the word SETI comes up a lot and it represents the beginning research project in radio astronomy. I had a lot of fun reading this book and I was able to obtain a great amount of knowledge. I would recommend people reading this book, and especially to those people that have the academic level of high school and up, and are interested in astronomy. This book would be a book that you would never want to put down and want to continue reading page after page, chapter after chapter.
0525945636|1.0|But the story has been developed too poorly (at least for Follet's standard).<br />The idea is great, even if the \\"schizophrenic\\" protagonist reminds me Bourne, a Ludlum's character.<br />There are too many coincidencies .... For example, I think that is quite impossible that a group of fellow students are, many years later, all involved in such an intrigue, with all these different rules <br />A plot like this needs more pages and more details to be told, and, I know, the author is able to..... I'm thinking for example to \\"The pillars of the earth\\", but this time he didn't...<br />This novel has been a great disappointment, expecially because I'm a Follet fan.... I've read almost all its books and this is, no doubt, one of the worsts.
0783225970|4.0|bloody gory extravagant alluring and very zealous in its portrayal of america. a lot of people cant get over the eighties pastiche quality that the movie holds but if that is the most obvious flaw then you are definately a victim of poor taste, that is almost as bad as saying that you hate john ford because he made westerns. that is what makes the movie what it is. you have to understand the era and the mentality of these men and there times. this movie is not strictly about cubans or latin americans a lot of it is across the board being of E.O my self i find the attitude in the majority of new immigrants transported to the west they want to look to a new hope and work towards something better (like tonys mother) but there are always those who are just out for the world. in urban areas of the world the most frightening and compelling reaction to this film is the imitation the message of dishonourable death at the end is always overlooked and the poor and deprived youth see it as the martyrdom the legend. they all want to be michael corleone holding the family under the wing and replacing the father as the new and improved. protecting there investment commanding through a system of respect and tradition.  but the reality is excess obsession double standards vicious jealousy and betrayal and for most of these bright young hopes is either a visit to the funeral director or the iron hotel. a superb movie but the message is too confused de palma is having too much fun with sub machine guns, chainsaws, uzi machines, knives, laundry bags filled with money, and piles of cocaine. de palma maybe the most stick and paste director that you ever saw but you must understand that it is not all howard hawks, besides how many ancient italian mobsters can you take we need too see where this vile world which controls our terrible primevil fantasies of tyranny and violence is going. respect is no longer the hand that rocks the cradle. it is cash and bullets. the will to do what the other guy wont. BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT IT IS ONLY FANTASY IT AINT REAL HOMIE.
014028009X|4.0|Bridget Jones's Diary, by Helen Fielding, is so funny that many of its flaws are overshadowed by its hilarity. The plot, for example, simply chronicles a year in the ordinary life of Bridget, a thirty-year-old single female set for self-improvement. However, by amusingly presenting Bridget's obsession with matters such as weight and alcohol consumption, Fielding brings the story to life, making the most ordinary story extraordinary. The plot, simple as it may be, also works to endear readers to Bridget and her diary. Her struggle to fight, yet failure to overcome a nicotine addiction and other humanistic desires allows the reader to relate to Bridget and all her imperfections. The fact that Bridget tackles realistic problems to begin with takes the reader one step further and allows the reader to actually be Bridget. Best of all, Fielding delivers this mastery in an easy to read, easy to follow, neatly arranged package. Chapters go by months, days start with cigarette, calorie, and lottery ticket counts, and relatively short dialogue  appears randomly scattered throughout. Being a quick, easy novel relating to female nature and relative to the female mind, Bridget Jones's Diary is the perfect read for any woman in need of nothing more than a good laugh.

6304288433|4.0|This was the best Halloween sequel out of them all!  'Halloween' was a better movie, but personally I liked 'Halloween 2' much better.  I'm a gore person.  I like gore, and believe me, this movie had plenty of it!  And is it just me, or did Jamie Lee look really good in this movie?  The best quality of this movie is how it picks up just seconds after the original ended.  The acting is pretty good, and the atmosphere is great.  A must see for all Halloweenies.
B000000OSW|4.0|One reviewer called this 'a highly personal sequence of songs that make Phil Collins sound like, well, Phil Collins.'  It reflected his recent divorce and personal anxieties.  Songs like 'Digging in the Dirt' were an explicit exploration of his interest in Jungian themes.  Normally I pay little attention to song lyrics, but I was startled when I heard the argument-in-the-car that makes up part of this song.  It was very, very close to home.<br />There are several good tunes here, and some attempt to satisfy the wider public who were expecting another 'So'.  But this is a highly introspective album, put together with infinite care.  For Gabriel newcomers, I would recommend starting with 'So' and 'Passion' first, then 'Security'.  Then go for this one or 'Secret World Live'.
6304288433|4.0|This was the best Halloween sequel out of them all!  'Halloween' was a better movie, but personally I liked 'Halloween 2' much better.  I'm a gore person.  I like gore, and believe me, this movie had plenty of it!  And is it just me, or did Jamie Lee look really good in this movie?  The best quality of this movie is how it picks up just seconds after the original ended.  The acting is pretty good, and the atmosphere is great.  A must see for all Halloweenies.
0767802519|5.0|I admit I'm a sucker for Jean Reno and his sunglasses.  He's an odd actor and he's done his share of odd films, but none has touched me as deeply as \\"The Professional\\" which marked the film debut of Natalie Portman as a young girl who escapes the slaughter of her entire family by taking refuge with a hitman. (Reno)<br />Mathilda's family life is less than ideal.  Her father is a drug-dealer, her mother is pretty much indifferent to the family and her older sister is a bully and a fool.  The only family member Mathilda can connect to is her little brother.  Outside of her family she also connects, or wants to connect, to L&eacute;on the stranger who lives down the hall, on whom she practices the few feminine wiles she's managed to pick up, not that L&eacute;on notices.  However, when a group of crooked cops murder everyone in Mathilda's family while she's out getting groceries, L&eacute;on is the only one she can turn to for help.  With incredible presence of mind she walks past the bloody scene in her apartment and rings his bell, and from that moment on he becomes her family. Mathilda wants to learn from L&eacute;on, she wants him to teach her how to become a \\"cleaner\\" so that she can take her revenge on the cop Stansfield (Gary Oldman giving one of the more bizarre performances of his career) and his men.  And because Mathilda is thirteen going on thirty-five, and knows how to get a point across, L&eacute;on eventually agrees.<br />The central focus of this film is the relationship that blooms between them.  It's not that of a father and daughter, nor is there anything avuncular about the way L&eacute;on treats Mathilda.  There's an element of teacher/student here, and perhaps even something of a brother/sister feeling, but underneath everything there is a kind of impossible longing between these two people which the wise-beyond-her-years Mathilda eventually verbalizes when she announces to L&eacute;on that she is in love with him.  And L&eacute;on, who doesn't begin to understand women of any age, (he had to leave Italy because of woman trouble) is stunned.  He doesn't know what to think or what to do about this child-woman he's now stuck with. But of course her age makes anything more impossible, and eventually dooms them to be parted.  It's in this parting, which takes place in a blaze of gunfire that you understand that they understand their feelings for each other, that what they feel is the love of equals.<br />\\"The Professional\\" is a profoundly moving film because the love L&eacute;on and Mathilda feel for each other is so transcendent and so completely doomed from the start.  There is nothing prurient here, nothing done for titillation or shock value, but rather there is a bittersweet acceptance that there simply are connections which cannot flourish along socially acceptable lines.  I cry buckets over the ending every time I see it.  This one is not for the faint of heart.to leave Italy because of woman trouble) is stunned.

B0000399WI|5.0|There is little else I can say about this film. In fact, I shouldn't even be reviewing this in fear that any word I type may deface the film's worth. It is definitely on my Top 10, up there  with Metropolis and Citizen Kane: amazing character studies, contrasting atmospheres, great cinematography, and terrific editing. Every frame is, in some way or another, truly heartfelt and carefully handled. A wonderous piece of modern filmmaking. . .
6304084145|1.0|In early 1889, Crown Prince Rudolph, son of Emperor Franz Joseph and heir to the Hapsburg Empire, took his teenage mistress, Baroness Maria Vetsera, to a hunting lodge called \\"Mayerling.\\"  What happened there has been the subject of a good deal of speculation, but the most popular version is this:  That sometime in the early morning hours of January 30th, Rudolph killed Maria with a single shot from his revolver, and then, some hours later, took his own life.  How they came to this moment in time is the subject of the film, \\"Mayerling\\" which stars Omar Sharif as Rudolph and Catherine Deneuve as Maria.<br />The film is highly sympathetic to the lovers, portraying them as kindred souls beset by the prejudices and stupidities of everyone around them.  Rudolph's liberal political views and Maria's innocence are made much of, and the idea that they were driven to the desperation of a suicide pact is central to the persuasiveness of this film.  Unfortunately I have a hard time buying any of it, and perhaps it's partly because I know too much about the real couple and their situation, but I think it's also because the film is so heavy-handed that we feel more bludgeoned than persuaded.  Sharif is wooden as Rudolph, but in all fairness some of the lines he's asked to deliver are almost laughable.  The Oedipal subtext between Rudolph and his mother, Elizabeth, has no real purpose beyond titillation, and it is frankly difficult to believe in Deneuve as ing&eacute;nue.  Had all the roles been written with more authenticity the story might well have worked as a tragedy, but Terence Young, who apparently drew on the novels of Claude Anet and Michel Arnold to write the screenplay, has taken the easy route here, complete with cardboard villains and people's heroes.  Not even James Mason as Franz Joseph or the ravishing Ava Gardner as Empress Elizabeth can propel this particular film out of the category of Bad Romance.<br />The look of the film owes more to the era in which it was made than that which it seeks to portray.  Makeup, hairstyles, even costumes reflect a sixties sensibility which may have put audiences at ease in 1968, but which are jarring today.  Frankly, this is one of the things that can really turn me off of a film; I tolerate it in \\"Doctor Zhivago,\\" but in \\"Mayerling\\" it becomes so distracting, that any credibility this film might have had for me goes right out the window whenever I see an actress with overdone, sixties-style eyeliner or lots and lots of hair woven into intricate, sixties-inspired dos.  I suggest you give this one a miss unless you're in the mood for some schmaltz.than that which it seeks to portray.

B00004YW6I|5.0|As a New Yorker, I can assure you that PJ Harvey's latest CD is the perfect soundtrack to this city's endless noise, heat, and mystery. I think what I have always admired about her is how she manages to mine some of the most classic rock and blues influences and synthesize them in an innovative and emotional way.  &quot;Good Fortune&quot; reminds me of a Patti Smith vocal matched to a Kurt Cobain chord structure but ends up being sheer Polly.  Somehow her music transcends her influences, which perhaps has something to do with her lyrics.  Her obsession with obsession seems to have ebbed a bit, but it has been replaced by a more reflective and deeper sentiment, and her lust has not (thankfully) lessened in the two years since her last cd. The rawness of 'This is Love,' the pain two people cause each other through love in 'This Mess We're In.&quot; I could go on but join me and give thanks to this brave, honest, sexy and simply amazing artist.
B000050FEN|5.0|How good of an actor is Kevin Spacey??  If you liked Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Hannible Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, then you'll love Kevin Spacey's portrayal of John Doe in Seven.  (excuse me, that's Sir Anthony Hopkins)  <br />By the way, I'm not comparing the two movies, I agree that they are completly different.  There is a bit of similarity between Lecter and Doe though.  <br />Seven is a wonderful movie, and the credit for that should not go entirely to Spacey (seeing how he wasn't actually in the film until the end).  Morgan Freeman did a hell of a job (one of his best) and Brad Pitt (wow!! if only he'd stick to films like this and Fight Club).  I must not forget Pitt's lovely wife (in the movie) Gwyneth Paltrow, she did an excellent job for the small part she had (thats screen time, she actually has a lot do with the movie, you just don't see her that much.)<br />As for the dvd itself, The animated storybord for the unshot ending alone is worth the extra money you pay (verses the original seven dvd)  I almost bought the original dvd, but I'm glad I didn't now, the double disc set is great.  <br />Not buying this dvd is the eighth deadly sin.

B00004U8H4|5.0|Unfortunately for &quot;American Psycho,&quot; the book has already garnered such a notoriously controversial stature that the film itself has a difficult task in trying to win over viewers. Like &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; many people may have already made up their minds about this movie long before they even consider watching it.<br />Like &quot;The Fight Club, &quot;American Psycho&quot; is a movie that could not be more misunderstood. Sure, this is about a psychopath on the most childishly obvious of all levels, but most of all this is satire on the yuppies of the mid to late 80's. It is an exploration in the hollow, meaningless existence of a rich Wall Street stock broker. A man who's life is so consumed by greed and power lunches that he can only find salvation whilst murdering someone. All the best scenes of &quot;American Psycho&quot; occur in the first three quarters of an hour. Christian Bale meticulously describes his morning routine with hilarious results and constantly tries to explain the significance of 1980's pop music. &quot;The Greatest Love of All's transcendant beauty makes it by far Whitney Houston's most accomplished record&quot; he claims, before butchering two girls. There is also a perfect scene in which Bale and his peers spend ten minutes arguing over who's business card font is better.<br />The violence (and sex) may be unsettling to some but is often times hilarious if you are willing to take it with a grain of salt. How can you not laugh when a bank machine asks Bale to &quot;feed me a stray cat?&quot;<br />This is a very clever and sophisticated film that could be perceived incorrectly. It is one of 2000's finer movies and deserves something better than to be overlooked because of the book's notoriety.
B00000JZC4|5.0|This CD is a testament to music. It is through and through a work of art. Each song can stand alone as a message about a different aspect of life, or if you take in the CD as a whole you see the reason for the order of the songs. To me the album talks about trying to kick a drug habit; going from addiction to asking for help to success and even longing. Not only supported by the lyrics, but the melodies tells a different yet connected story.<br />I like listening to this CD when I'm working. It helps me concentrate and doesn't put me to sleep like sooting music.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie, written by Mitch Albom, is a book that teaches the lesson of life through sad dying eyes with a warm heart.  SUffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, Professor Morrie Schwartz gets visited by a former student named Mitch Albom, the author of the book.  Albom keeps revisitng Morrie every Tuesday and learns about life, forgiveness, marriage, and death.  I thought this book was great and really taught me a lesson about life.  People might not want to admit it, but whoever has read this book probably felt like it related to them or touched them in some way.  Through Morrie the reader understand and realize what is really important and valuable in life.  Many people in today's society are caught in work, school, and money.  After reading this book one will realize that what is truly important in life is life itself, health, and family.  Morrie himself is a dichotomy both physically and mentally.  WHen I say he is a dichotomy, I mean that he himself is dying yet he shares his knowledge of life with so many people, specifically Mitch Albom.  Morrie's words and lectures can be compared to an heirloom, it just keeps getting passed on forever, form Mitch Albom to us, the readers.  The one part of Morrie that I liked the best was his attitude that even though he only has about ay ear to live he sitll kept a positive apperances in his lectures.  In a way he gave me and Mitch ALbom a new life, a life that we look at through a different perspective, a life where we can see what is really valuable and important.

After watching their special on MTV from the Playboy mansion I fell in love with the song &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; and since I don't use Napster, I figured I'd but the CD since I knew that I liked &quot;Rollin'&quot; as well. After listening to the entire CD all the way through, I was hyped up and ready for more. Although the CD has a great deal of cursing and anger in it, it has great lyrics. I am planning on going out and getting the other CD's as soon as I have more money. Go out and buy this CD now!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Every once in a while, a film comes along which completely flips Hollywood head over heels, blasts its way into public awareness, and is recognized for its brilliance and messages by the people.<br />     Fight Club is by no means one of these movies. It is something far greater.<br />     For one thing, it was not recognized. The Acadamy, ever-so-typically, refused to acknowledge this film for what it is -- namely, the most perfect portrait of modern society ever set down on a plastic sheet. Indeed, if the Oscars HAD recognized Fight Club, it would have lost some of its potency. Part of its greatness lies in the fact that it is a true antiestablishment film, which have been quite rare since the Sixties, and being recognized by the establishment would have been rather contradictory. The fact that today's young men, and not the older members of society, tend to love this movie, is quite telling. This movie will never turn society on its head, but it will percolate through society, as it is already doing.<br />     The messages of the film conflict with those that society constantly sends us. Where every day we are subliminally convinced to invest in the economy, to trade in our youthful ideals for a place in capitalist machinations, Fight Club points a gun at our heads and tells us to do whatever the f**k we feel like. That capitalism crushes the individual. There are strong undercurrents of anarchy in the film, but this is not political anarchy; it is philisophical anarchy, the principle that we should all allow our minds to take whatever direction they want to. The entire film in a sense is an allegory; the message is that laws and rules restrict thought, but that the part of us that desires COMPLETE anarchy can get out of hand.<br />     In short, Fight Club is the most important and the best film made in the past several years. While I have heard that the film only appeals to GenX'ers, it is also extremely powerful for those like me in the &quot;25 and under&quot; category, who are also seeking philosophical foundations in a hypocritical, apathetic, cynical, and indeed, wholly unpleasant society.<br />     &quot;What's that smell?&quot;
B00003CX8J|2.0|The graphics are somewhat cool, but the movie itself lacked a major factor &quot;an ENDING&quot; . The only part I like was a special feature of Spider Man entering into a scene which made everyone laughed. My last word is that the movie needed more than just special effects.
B000003TAR|5.0|&quot;In Utero&quot; is probably my favorite Nirvana cd, because the recording is so raw, the lyrics are fascinating, and the music is brilliant and just plain rocks.  Not nearly as light or humorous as &quot;Nevermind,&quot; this album showcases the true Nirvana at their insane best.  Most of the songs are distorted, fast, and heavy.  However &quot;Dumb&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot; - my favorite Nirvana songs - are quiet, intuitive, and self-deprecating.  Dave Grohl does some of his best work on &quot;Serve the Servants,&quot; &quot;Scentless Apprentice,&quot; and &quot;Heart-Shaped Box.&quot;  And Kurt Cobain's gravely voice and lyrics are very insightful, painfull, and moving.  From the desperate screams of, &quot;Rape me!&quot; to the repeated singing of the line, &quot;What is wrong with me?&quot; on &quot;Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter,&quot; it really isn't any surprise that Kurt killed himself. &quot;In Utero&quot; is Nirvana for people who are willing to take a step away from &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and listen to something a little harder to swallow.  This record takes time to get used to after hearing the more mainstream, catchy tunes like &quot;Come As You Are,&quot; &quot;Lithium,&quot; and &quot;In Bloom.&quot;  But it is definitely as good as &quot;Nevermind&quot; if not better.

0525945636|3.0|Without going into the details of the plot, Follet's latest thriller has an exciting beginning and has interesting and well-developed characters. Overall, Code To Zero is a fast and enjoyable &quot;read&quot;. However, its suspense gradually wanes and the so-called &quot;surprises&quot; and eventual outcome become somewhat predictable. Further, you might feel that you have to suspend belief more than you are willing to in regards to the ease with which the main character:  1) discovers who he is and what he does after learning he has amnesia; and  2) uncovers the plot to sabotage the U.S.'s launching of its Explorer I satellite.<br />Code To Zero, despite its limitations, is worth reading but I'd suggest you take it from the library. There are better books on which to plunk down $26.95.
0679879269|4.0|Right, first off, let me say that I don't think this is a children's book. The subtlety of the ending (I had to think about it for a while before I got what had happened) and the maturity of the story are too challenging for anyone younger than 12 (coincidentally, the age of the two main protagonists), in my opinion. This goes for the His Dark Materials series as a whole, but for this third and final instalment in particular.<BR>Secondly, I can't believe Philip Pullman got away with such an audacious premise without being lambasted more! The central premise is nothing less than a war against what Christians would call God, yet the much less radical Harry Potter books have got a lot more stick. I think that devoutly religious people might have a serious problem with the anti-religious message, unless they were pretty open-minded.<BR>On the whole, I enjoyed The Amber Spyglass's rebellious, think-again message as well as its fantastical settings, but I feel that the plot could perhaps be a little better handled. The major events seem terribly low-key, and the ending is perhaps a little *too* subtle - not enough seems to have changed, at least 'on-screen'. Perhaps, though, the author meant it that way - implying that change comes not in huge leaps but gradually. The age of the protagonists, while fitting nicely in the first two books, also makes the ending less believable.<BR>On the whole, though, I think the His Dark Materials series is well worth reading. It has the potential to both fascinate and open minds.

When I read &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; and about the relationship between Lyra and Will and how it grew into love, I became beautified at the lyricism and the joy it brought to the story. Although the book did tend to be a tad long and eccentric, altogether I loved reading it. It was a great ending to the trilogy. Let's just hope that Pullman continues on another series.

0671042858|4.0|Fans of Stephen King will not believe he wrote a book you can lift with one hand. Friends of the blow-'em-up endings of Needful Things and Insomnia (among others) may be disappointed that the fireworks is missing. But in this short, tense novel you will find all the slowly mounting fear, dread and terror that Stephen King writes so masterfully. And he does it slowly, carefully, and, as always, letting us fill in the blanks with the worst of our own nightmares.  A little girl gets lost while on a hike in the woods with her mother and brother. She is lost spiritually and psychologically, too. Her parents have divorced and her brother is stuck in his own anger. King uses the clever device of the samness of the woods, the sameness of her attempt to find a way out as a counterpoint to her interior struggle with despair, the existence of God, her relationship to her angry parents.  As her Walkman fades out she is left utterly alone. Well, except for the hallucinations (or is that scrabbling in the leaves real?)  In this book, King shows that that terror can travel slowly, and that if the world ends with a whimper instead of a bang, it can still be terrifying.
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is by far one of the best movies made in the past decade. An excellent screenplay adapted from the Stephen King short story. Shawshank does justice to the short story which cannot be said of many films that were adapted from books. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superbly cast as two men who are fighting a judicial system that is &quot;too blind&quot; Shawshank is a true example of Man vs. Society AND Man vs. Himself.
B00003CXE7|5.0|&quot;Gladiator&quot; could just as easily have been a bad film. When was the last time we even heard of a movie about gladiators? Hadn't it become a joke? \\"Do you like movies about gladiators?\\" Isn't that what Peter Graves, playing a perverted airline pilot, asks a ten-year-old boy in the first reel of &quot;Airplane&quot;? Sword and sandal epics had become a Hollywood terror. There was &quot;Ben Hur&quot; and &quot;Spartacus&quot;, but then Italy stuck their profiteering fingers in the pie and gave us a parade of terrible films that would forever disgrace the genre... Until now.<br />Ridley Scott, though skeptical at first, decided to take upon himself the challenge of crafting an old-fashioned epic that would enthrall audiences in the same manner that those aforementioned classics did. And he succeeded. &quot;Gladiator&quot; is, honest to God, Scott's best film since &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. It's also his first major blockbuster. <br />And, man, does it DELIVER! It offers a grand spectacle as well as a classically structured tale about honor and heroism. Few films can get away with being so, well, masculine. Scott's handling of the battle scenes is terrific. They are electric, exciting and oh so very bloody. Egad! What a thrilling mess! Shot with elegance and adorned by a wonderful musical score (by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard). And then you have the cast. Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, the ailing Caesar of Rome, about to appoint a successor to his throne. But it wont be his rather amoral and conniving son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). There is also Oliver Reed in his final performance as the slave trader Proximo. Reed brings such flavor and character to his supporting role, that he nearly walks away with the picture. It's a grand and eloquent swan song performance that reminds us all of what a great actor he was and how much poorer we are for losing him. It's really too bad that he had plummeted into near obscurity before this. &quot;Gladiator&quot; would have made for an exquisite comeback.<br />In other key supporting roles - BBC favorite Derek Jacobi as a just Roman senator, Connie Nielsen as Commodus's benign and stronger-than-she-seems sister and Djimon Hounsou (who made such an impact in Spielberg's underrated &quot;Amistad&quot;.) as a noble gladiator.  This is a very well-rounded cast. And at the center of it all is the star- Russell Crowe, one of the most exciting actors to appear in the last decade, proving once and for all that he can carry a picture. As Maximus, he delivers a performance of great richness and depth. This is a classic hero that you really want to root for, and Crowe has a gift for communicating his inner pain. He has been disgraced, his family has been murdered. He wants vengeance, but he also wants to set things right for Rome in the process. I love the little nuances that he brings to the role. The way he rubs sand in his hands before each battle (a detail that was not in the script). All great stuff. With his ruggedness and everyman qualities, Crowe could end up being a Harrison Ford-type role model for a whole new generation of young moviegoers. But, in difference to Ford, Crowe has proven to be more of a risk taker. Playing diverse roles in less commercial films. <br />You really can't ask for a meatier and more satisfying blockbuster. The screenplay gives its characters plenty of grand melodramatic dialogues. Particularly the scenes given to Phoenix. If Crowe is the star, then Phoenix is the breakout success of this film. Here we have a young actor who walks in the shadow of his late brother River Phoenix. But you want to know my opinion? Joaquin is a richer, more complex actor than his brother ever was. It isn't easy to portray a villain like this. Instead of going for the easy way out and making him an out-and-out baddie, he makes him a complex and tragic figure. An ambitious young man who is riddled with insecurities and deep down only wants to be accepted. And his whispery deliveryof key dialogues makes him menacing yet sympathetic. <br />&quot;Gladiator&quot; may not be perfect. I mean, that melodrama can get a bit overbearing at times. And it makes for a couple of unwanted lulls when the film should just keep moving. But overall, Scott has put the whole package together so well, that one way or another you get caught up in this little Roman soap opera whether you like it or not. One might want to argue at the complete historical accuracy of it all. But it feels pretty real. And watching those battles, I couldn't help but make a connection to Wrestlemania... Think about it. These gladiators were in fact star athletes weren't they? The film's way of handling that aspect of the story is so infectious, that by the time Maximus shouts at the coliseum: \\"Are you not entertained?\\" one almost feels like cheering right along with the crowd. <br />The spectacular box office success of this film makes one think that there just might be hope out there for quality enterainments. I mean, vapid idiocy can be good for a laugh sometimes, but movies shouldn't always be mere products.
B00004VVND|4.0|I saw Westworld at a theatre when I was 7 years old (my parents didn't know!!) It scared the ... out of me back then because of the visuals (robots taking their faces off ect.) When I saw Westworld a few years ago it was just as scary because of the suspense factor(the special effects are kind of cheezy by today's standards) If you watch Westworld for the entertainment value and look past all the shortcomings in special effects- it is very entertaining and suspenseful. Westworld is a very good story with an ending that will keep you on the edge of your seat biting your fingernails!! Glad to see it out on DVD!!
0380788624|5.0|While reading this book, it quickly became clear to me that I was onto something special.  I am a lover of history, historical fiction and I write romantic fiction.  So, while this falls in with my general reading habits, it was unlike anything I'd ever read before.  I knew nothing about cyrptography, nor do I have any extensive knowledge of computer science.  Stephenson has a gift for making difficult material accessible to everyone.  If he could explain mathematical concepts to me (I consider myself numerically impaired!), it is clear that the man has no ordinary intellect.  If you want a compeling, enlightening and entertaining read, this is the book.

B00004U8H4|3.0|Imagine a combination of  Bonfire of the Vanities, Fight Club and Theatre of Death and you'll get an idea of what the film American Psycho is like-- Yuppies, testosterone, and high camp.  It zeroes in on the easiest of targets, and delights in skewering the yuppie life-style in sick and sadistic fashion.  Well that's not exactly true --  in Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 best-seller the victims were mostly  mercilessly tortured before they were brutally killed and every detail was grimly described.  It was a very disturbing book.  It almost wasn't published.<br />The film however, barely touches on the sadism and misogyny of the book.  It's a poseur film, skimming the surfaces of already overly- skimmed surfaces, making very easily made points, and getting very obvious and easy laughs.<br />This compromise is significant when compared to the book, the book took the plunge and never came up for air.  That's why the book just won't go completely away, it might not have a lot on its mind, but it sure cuts right to the bone.  Forget about the book, though, few have actually read it.  Quite a few bought it and started to read it, but most didn't finish it.  It's too gross, too bloody, too bleak, too sick, and too repetitious.<br />I was surprised at how much fun I had while watching the film, knowing what a watered down compromise it is.  Perhaps  watching the yuppies of the 80's getting their deserved bashing is the updated equivalent of snobby rich folks who wind up getting hit with pies in Three Stooges shorts.  It's quite fun.<br />Another big reason for enjoying  it all so much is Christian Bale.  He plays the part with the kind of put on airs the reminded  me of some not quite human mix of Vincent Price and James Mason trapped inside a California type male model.  And though the performance is mannered, it doesn't feel forced.  It's not a performance coming from a stage actor ,who would be too keenly aware of when an audience might be reacting or laughing.  It's the type of performance a film actor like DeNiro, would have delivered to us when he was younger.  Now Bale hardly looks like an average  New Yorker as Patrick Bateman but I found the performance very entertaining. It carries the film.<br />Patrick Bateman is an extremely successful business man, his dad is a major stockholder so he's got job security and so is bored and easily distracted.  Patrick plays the competitive game with his co-workers, making sure he has the latest gadgets, the right shoes, the expensive tailored suits.  He must keep fit and look good and employs an exacting ritual involving soaps, creams, facial masks and herbal lotions to make sure he looks his best every day.  He works out obsessively, sometimes while watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  However, he barely has his own identity.  A running joke in the film has him being mistaken for one of his co-workers.  A key scene in the film involves an in-depth analysis and discussion about Business Cards.  Low key, but specially designed business cards that the young Yuppie's talk about and become envious of.<br />Eventually we realize that Patrick Bateman (reminiscent of the similarly named Norman Bates) has a strange hobby.  He likes to kill.  We first see his dark side when a street person begs him for money.  Suddenly, Bateman savagely stabs the pitiful beggar.  Afterward he straightens his clothing, sighs, and goes about his business.  Just a way to relieve some stress, a way to cope with the pressure.<br />In other words, here's a Yuppie who has completely twisted any sense of morals to believe someone else's life is as insignificant as a two year old BMW.  Can he really get away with this? We find out he sure can.  He seems unstoppable.<br />The film could have wound up being flat and stale.  But it never is.  It's a film about style, made with some flair and it feels fresher than it has any right to.  This is because there is a  feminist viewpoint brought to the film by  Mary Harron who directedand co-wrote the film with Guinevere Turner.  The film's Patrick Bateman is a selfish, self obsessed, type A driven male.  A fragile, preening creature that is not an atypical Hollywood movie serial killer nor a killer who murders when in a  homicidal rage.  In fact this killer prefers to control the stage he kills in, often able to provide his own background music, maybe something by Huey Lewis, or  maybe something by Phil Collins. Patrick Bateman is a big fan of songs like It's Hip to Be Square and SuSudio.  To Patrick Bateman, killing is his true orgasm.  He can  control himself for short periods of time, but he's  weak, he's male and he's gonna blow sooner or later.  He's going to kill and kill again.  Maybe all this killing is even all in his mind -- nothing more than a twisted yuppie fantasy. Then again, perhaps it's not.  Whatever he can't completely control --he kills.  If something gets through to him, touches him, or exposes something vulnerable,-- he kills.<br />Willem Dafoe playing a detective on Bateman's trail was a great idea, but nothing is done with it, and Reese Witherspoon seems the kind of future trophy wife a guy like Bateman would have.  Jared Leto  plays  the kind of Yuppie scum everyone hates.  In fact we hate this guy so much he makes Bateman palatable.  His character is named Paul Allen which is funnier now, (particularly to someone in the NorthWest) than it was when the book was written.<br />Chloe (Boys Don't Cry) Sevigny as a secretary who has a crush on Bateman makes a real impression.  She finds a sweetness within her character that humanizes and warms every scene she's in.  Without her performance the film would be a completely cold exercise in style. Cara Seymour plays a prostitute Bateman picks up to play games.  She finds a fascinating balance of fear, vulnerability, need and self-loathing in her portrayal and makes a lasting impression though her screen time is short.<br />It's a sick black comedy with some truly twisted ideas. The gore in the film however is not as plentiful as you might think and none of it feels real enough to be disturbing.Harron who directed and co-wrote the film with Guinevere Turner.

006092988X|5.0|Author Betty Smith was a one hit wonder. Although she wrote other novels, her work after &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; never came close to capturing the characterizations and sense of time and place exhibited in this fine, even extraordinary, piece of writing that was released in 1943. <br /> But so what? Who needs an encore when the first performance has readers standing in the aisles?  &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is as readable today as it was fifty years ago. It has stood the test of time to become one of America's most beloved and enduring novels. <br />   The story evolved from Ms. Smith's experiences growing up in Brooklyn in the very early 1900s. Although it is a novel, it's obvious that the core experiences are autobiographical. The main character in the book, Francie Nolan, is Betty Smith.<br /> The book carries us through a little more than ten years of life with the poor but proud Nolan family. The Nolans face numerous hardships - the heartbreak of losing a warm-hearted but alcoholic father, the attempted rape of Francie, the shame of being poor - but they are held together by the steely determination of Francie's mother, Katie.<br /> There are unique characters, perhaps the most unforgettable is the promiscuous and colorful Aunt Sissy who worked in a condom factory, had the habit of marrying time and time again without getting a divorce, and had ten babies stillborn, until a fake pregnancy brings her first healthy child (how? I won't give that away.)<br /> But the book's strongest point is its ability to capture a place and a time: Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century America. Not since Charles Dickens has a writer so skillfully described an era and a physical setting. Betty Smith harpooned with a pen the details and nuances that made Brooklyn the true melting pot of America, a rugged and confused place that bore more genius than anywhere else in the world.    Ms. Smith is gone. Her tree is still growing.
6305744742|3.0|Plot mechanics muddle everything in this so-so big screen version of the entertaining 60's t.v. show based on the famous New Yorker cartoons. The screenwriters have altered the original family and given us a rather ordinary predictable plot that involves an Uncle Fester imposter (Christopher Lloyd) which alters the chemistry of the well-known family.  It's called fixing something that wasn't broken.  They spend too much time setting up and positioning the characters.<br />The casting is quite good, and there are some funny moments and extremely inventive camera-work, but the script isn't sharp enough and instead of being dark, campy and clever, it's often strained and stupid.<br />Tops are the perfectly cast Angelica Huston, and Christini Ricci with Raul Julia being an acceptable Gomez.<br />The sequel Addams Family Value is much better.<br />Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

0812589041|5.0|In the 6th grade, i spotted my friend reading this book. I read the back, and found it interesting. The book was fairly beat-up, and had obviously had been used a lot. I borrowed it from him, and read one-fourth of the book that night, and forced my parents to take me to a book store to get it. I finished it shortly( within the next couple days) and I loved it instantly. In a week, I got the other three(just as good). Ender's game is about a boy that has a talent that no one else has. He is a born and bred genius, in a world of other geniuses. He is smarter than all the rest, and shows promise. It is believed that he will save the world. This is a truly great book that is a must read for everybody. Because of it all my names in everything(that don't require my real name) have been TheXenocide. Discover what that is in the book.
6302000823|4.0|This movie, just to hear it described, should have been one of my favorites -- a small town, a love of movies, comical villagers, a kindly projectionist, an adolescent crush -- and yet it's not.  The reason is because it's sentimental.  I'm all for sentiment.  I cry at &quot;Big,&quot; for gosh sakes.  But this movie goes over the top (or under the bottom) in its blurring of what the storyteller feels and how much the storyteller wants us to feel for ourselves.  The end -- which I won't divulge although I must warn you that if this is the first post you're reading, there are some spoilers in other posts -- is a lovely surprise that broke my heart because it didn't belong to a stronger movie.  (And I'd like to meet the guy behind me in the theater who blurted out what the surprise was a moment before I would have realized it for myself.)
0446310786|4.0|An 8-year-old tomboyish girl named Scout, living in Maycomb county, is exposed to issues in life such as class, justice, and race, learning valuable life lessons from each event as seen from her perspective.  Along with the life lessons come the nature of a child.  The sense of wonder and and her ornery behavior is also shown in the boook.            What sets this book apart from others that I've read is the author's decision to write in the perspective of a child.  Most books that I've read are told from an older person's perspective.  The effect created by doing this is more adventure and details, since a kid is adventurous and has a creative mind.  The author did a good job of not losing the the main idea of the book with the different events going on and even though the perspective was told thorough the child's eyes.            I can identify my own life at a young age with the life of Scout.  Since she was a young child, not everything was always told to her.  It was covered with a blanket in hopes that she wouldn't discover what was going on.  She always wanted to be in on the action knowing all that she could.  Me as a child was the same way, and still am today.  A curious, independent, wondering child would best describe Scout and me.  Always wanting to be in the center, &quot;I pushed my way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of ligh.  H-ey, Atticus!&quot;. (154)  This is a quote of when Scout, Jem, and Dill snuck out of the house at ten o'clock at night to see where there father/uncle was going.  When they found him surrounded by a big crowd of people outside the jail protecting the person he was defending in court, the kids went right through them standing next to Atticus.  This shows the sense of wonder, ornery nature, and the courage the kids had in the book.            This book is a book that I believe everyone should read in their lifetime.  Since it deals with the main issue of racisim and prejudice.  Everyone will come across this once in their lifetime and is something that everyone can relate to.  The life lessons that Scout learned can also be taught by the book to the reader.  I feel that this book is for everyone that is capable of reading and able to comprehend the issues revealed.
0783229100|5.0|What a joy just thinking about &quot;The Sting&quot; again.  I catch it every time it shows up on cable.  Why?  I think part of its appeal is how richly the script immerses itself in the way these con men talk and think.  Any movie that revels in the details of a person's work is fascinating to me, and you become utterly absorbed here in what Newman and Redford are doing.  You don't know what their goal is (besides conning Shaw -- but how?), and that's all the more fun.<br />The music might be of a period older than the setting of the story (turn of the century vs. the thirties), but it fits the attitudes and pacing perfectly.  In fact, this movie is full of smart choices.  One of my favorites is the close-up of Redford's face when he looks back at his dead friend near the beginning of the picture -- it's what sets up the forward momentum that drives the rest of the story (his determination) -- lesser movies wouldn't have included it.<br />I admit with all humility that I did figure out the end of the movie (which I won't divulge), but an earlier twist, involving &quot;Celino,&quot; or however it's spelled, threw me completely.<br />It's better than &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; (less glib and meandering), and I can only wonder why Newman and Redford didn't make a third movie.  Even at their age now, the chemistry must still be there, and the right script (which is probably what they've been waiting for) would capitalize on that.
0061002747|4.0|This book, unlike most of agatha christie's books, had a pretty good beginning, it caught your interest right away.  The characters were interesting as usual, and the storyline was  also very good, but I was a little disappointed with the ending.  It is definately not one of her better books, but It's still a very good book nontheless.
6300216209|1.0|I can't believe all the stars I'm seeing here.  Did these people think they were writing about &quot;Casablanca&quot; by mistake?  &quot;Love Story&quot; is its own bad joke, surpassed only by &quot;Lovely Story,&quot; Burnett and Korman's intentionally hilarious sendup on the old &quot;Carol Burnett Show.&quot;  MacGraw pouts instead of acts, Segal inserts hip (1970) profanity instead of characterization, and O'Neal amazingly walks away from Milland at the end, when the last line of the novel (in which Oliver cries in his father's arms) was what pushed weepy readers over the edge.  I've read that the snowball-fight montage was inserted after the rest of the film had been shot because the filmmakers realized that the two brats who were their main characters needed a shot of humanity.  Too little too late.  O'Neal himself said it best a year later in &quot;What's Up, Doc?&quot; when Streisand said to him, &quot;Love means never having to say you're sorry.&quot;  He replied, &quot;That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.&quot;<br />(If I had to say something nice about the movie, I'd admit under pressure that the counterpoint of Lai's score with the music emanating from the practice rooms where O'Neal is looking for MacGraw was a nice touch.  But I'm not really saying it.)
0425129586|5.0|I remember when my ninth grade teacher handed out this book for our class to read, after the first few pages of reading it, I was just so bored.  In the beginning, she goes through the description of the characters, which is essential but boring.  But once the characters arrive on the island and people start to die, it really is terrific.  Unlike a few of Christie's books in which the ending was dull, the ending is surprising and you'll never guess who dunnit.  This is the best Christie book I have ever read.  I would recommend this book to anyone, even if you're not a big Agatha Christie fan.

B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie was bold and delightful and the action was intense and manly. In most minds it was violent and brutal. I found this to be true but inbetween that I fell in love with the consistent imagery most certainly brought together by the visual nature and general dark and dusty color of most of the filming and most certainly the amazing scoring of the film. The soundtrack like in most masterpieces completes this film giving it the added reoccuring nature of the plot. It was inspiring and certainly led me to believe that this movie would not have been the same without Zimmer on the project. He was masterful and certainly many scenes became epic with his help. I believe the calming nature of the vocals and background music blended into the time and certainly gave the aspect of reality of music to the film. I need this soundtrack as I feel it can take me back to the imagery of the movie and certainly can intrigue many minds.<br />If you haven't seen this movie I truely suggest it. However don't just watch it but listen to it and I feel you to will fall in love with its grand nature. I will forever remember the grain fields as a place I would be calm and serene in. <br />This is not meant to down play the actors and actresses of this movie or the special effects. I just feel the music should not be overlooked as a great benefit to the ears.
B0000508U6|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. The first song that I had heard from it was &quot;Yellow&quot; -- which is awesome, but certainly not my favorite. &quot;Shiver&quot; &quot;Everything's not Lost&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; are probably the best on there, but all of the songs have a mood and a musicality to them that is very impressive. At first, I thought they were like Travis -- if you've heard of them, but they have a much better sense of what sounds good. The quality of their music is what is the best, because occasionally the lyrics can fall below par. However, because the lyrics seem to fit with the beat and melody of the song, that becomes the strong point, over whatever kind of strictly word poetics many bands use. All in all, I would say BUY this CD. Now.
B00000JCB3|1.0|Limp Bizkit. What kind of a name is THAT? And that nookie s**t ain't helping anything.
B00004XONN|5.0|This CD grew on me like no other has in, at least, the last dozen years or so.  Before first listening to the CD I was already familiar with the single, &quot;Optimistic&quot;, and expected the rest of the CD to be along the same musical theme.  But upon listening to it I found that album &quot;Kid A&quot; was a different animal, indeed.  There was too much new and different contained in the CD to absorb it all in one or two listenings.  After the first few listenings, I said &quot;Hey, those first three tracks are great!&quot;  Then upon further listening, it was up to the first five tracks, then the first 9 tracks, and now the whole disc.  Now, I'm hooked and I can't get enough of it.<br />I think there are many things that make this album special.  One is the general lack of lyrics and what lyrics there are are barely understandable.  This, ordinarily, would not be a good thing but in this case the results are truly amazing.  In this case, the voice and samples of the voice are used as a musical instrument that still manages to express emotions in such a way as to get the point across.  It's the sound of the voice and not necessarily the words that are importent.  This is true for just about every track on the disc.<br />Next is the keyboards, guitar, and percussion.  Just the right emphasis at just the right time.  I love the percussion (organic or electronic) on &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot;.  Kind of Techno but not quite Techno.  On this disc the guitar is kind of laid back but tastie.  With the guitar sort of in the background, this makes room for some great spacey keyboards.  The first couple beautiful notes at the very beginning of the disc are an instant attention grabber and there's more of the same throughout the disc.<br />Lastly, I think the production and sound quality is esspecially well done.  In many cases, it's a densely produced sound that still manages to project each voice, instrument, or sample in a clear and balanced way that'spleasing to the ear.<br />Well, it's pretty obvious by now that I consider &quot;Kid A&quot; something special.  There are a few albums that I would compare it to, not musically, but in how it stands out among all the other music of its day.  In the sixties it was &quot;Sargent Peppers...&quot;, in the seventies it was probably &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, and in the eighties it might have been &quot;Joshua Tree&quot;.  Each one of these albums took a leap beyond what was being done at the time and became catalysts for what came after.  I think &quot;Kid A&quot; is the album that does it for us now.
0375500901|3.0|This book is truly a rollercoaster!! The plot similar to the popular amusent park thrill ride because it keeps you on the edge of your seat through an array of dips and turns. Unfortunately, the writing style is also rollercoaster-esque. When Silva is on his game, the writing is brilliant: smooth, hilarious, and affecting. When he isn't (which seems all too often during the middle chapters), the writing is choppy and predictable. I'm a humongous Silva fan though, believe me! His plots have always been easy to follow and The Kill Artist is no different (Definitely a plus!). Hopefully, Silva will keep producing easy-to-follow thriller novels but will keep the rollercoasting to simply the plot, not the writing style as well!!
015650300X|4.0|This book teachs many things about life.  On every plant that Le Petit Prince lands on the book teachs us something new.  It teachs us about many different personalities people can have.  It's also a very interesting book.  It's not a book that I got hooked on, but it's diffenatly a good story.  It's interesting how the author, Antoine-Marie-Roger de Saint-Exupery, has himself as a character in the book and how is playing himself, as a piolt, just as he is.
B0000019HU|5.0|Quite simply . . . from all perspectives, this is one of the greatest releases of all time. From a recording perspective--the sound is amazing, powerful and full of stunning dynamics. The drum sound alone on Spiderland is worth picking up a copy for. From a original songwriting perspective--there are many imitators of Slint's quiet, understated power . . . but no one comes close.<br />Any fans of dark, minimal independent music should have this in their collection. Spiderland is one of the most beautiful recordings that I own.
0425170349|2.0|I had only read one other book by Clancy (SSN), when I decided to pick this one up. I expected something action-packed, but what action there was, was dull and repetitive. It's the same &quot;aamericans are better than everyone else in the world&quot; plot, and it seemed that the terrorists never really stood a chance during any of their missions. This book also should be clipped down to about 500 pages, and it probably would be much more effective.
B00004Z311|5.0|I do not know why people seem to think this movie is not so great.  It has always been one of my absolute favorites, (and I haven't even seen the director's cut, I've only seen the cropped version). You see, when I watch a movie, I don't think of reasons why it was not perfect, I just decide whether I liked it or not! In my opinion, this movie is GREAT. I can't wait to get it on dvd and watch the uncut version. So it's not perfect, SO WHAT. Watching this movie is like being able to wade through a dream world without being asleep! Not to mention that, for the time this movie was brought out, the make-up and visual effects were, and still are, SUPERB.
B00003CXE6|4.0|The plot of Ridley Scott's new epic &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a mix of the two movies I listed above, along with tigers and many visual treats. The plot and characters aside (who cares if they make up the movie?), this film is fantastic. The battle scenes are extremely well excecuted and thrilling, Crowe makes Mel Gibson look like a whimp, and there's also a good helping of blood too. Had there been a plot for this movie, and some characters who weren't hired right after the making of Braveheart, this film could have earned a five star rating.
B000002TQB|5.0|What more can be said about Blur's third effort? Thier previous efforts (Leisure, Modern Life is Rubbish) helped to strengthen thier name, especially with such singles as Chemical World and Theres No Other Way.  However, its the infectuous eighties new wave inspired single &quot;Girls and Boys&quot; that gave Blur thier claim to fame.<br />Parklife blends a myriad of musical and poetical influences and then releases a monumental, emotional symphony out of the speakers.  &quot;To the End&quot; is quite possibly the best love song ever written and composed &quot;You and I collapsed in love...&quot; is a brilliant piece of prose.  At times emotions fill the room (End of a Century, This is a Low, Badhead) and other times raw energy spews out of the speakers (Bank Holiday, Lot 105, Jubilee).<br />Lyrically speaking, Parklife could very well replace any poetry youve read.  Tracy Jacks is a confused individual who decides to leave home because, in Damons words &quot;He knew in his heart he was over&quot;.  Theres the evocative &quot;And on the malinhead, Blackpool looks blue and red, and the queen...shes gone round the bend, jumped off lands end&quot; from &quot;This is a Low&quot; and the at times humorous portrayel of everyday life in Britian (Parklife, Bank Holiday).  Couple these lyrics with the genious of Graham Coxens guitar and his swift chord changes and you have a masterpiece.<br />Unfortunately many people see Blur only for &quot;Song 2&quot; which is a tragedy. Parklife is the precise definition of Blur before being bastardized by the North American music media and is a terrific album from start to finish.
B00003CX8J|4.0|You're grown up now.  You don't read comics.  Time, Wall Street Journal, your local paper; those are the kinds of things you read.  Not comics.<br />Get over it.  <br />This is a really fun movie, that handles its source material with enough respect to allow everyone from rabid fan to fresh initiate to enjoy this film.  The special effects are used for effect more than to dazzle, and the sound will showcase your home theater welll.  The story is engaging, relying on characters to move the plot more than it relies on the standard super villian plot.  The characters are well fleshed out, with only a few exceptions (Halley Berry's character, Storm, being one of the poorest portrayals, but she gets minimal screen time).  <br />Best of all, it satisfies the kid within.  It has adventure, action, romance, conflict - and a grounding in reality that effectively suspends your disbelief.  Give it a look.

6305907145|3.0|If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, then you're bound to be dissapointed with this film. However, if, like me, you don't like to miss out on ANY romantic period drama with a beautiful cast and costumes, then you may want to pick up this video.<br />PLUS POINTS of the movie as I see it:-<br />1) great chemistry between the heroine, Fanny Price and her 2    suitors i.e. Henry Crawford (or &quot;the rake&quot;, as Fanny calls    him) and Edmund Bertram (the kind cousin whom Fanny secretly    loves). I personally enjoy the scenes involving Fanny and    Henry Crawford (rake or no rake) because he's truly in love    with her and tries so hard (and in so many romantic ways) to    win her heart.<br />2) gorgeous costumes, lavish balls, lovely music and romantic    waltzes.<br />3) brilliant acting all around and a beautiful cast (including       Frances  O'Connor's &quot;Fanny Price&quot;, Jonny Lee Miller and    Justine Waddell).<br />The movie's not without its FLAWS, EVEN IGNORING the fact that the screenplay deviates quite heavily from the Austen novel:-<br />1) After watching the movie, I begin to see some of the other    reviewers' points of view on the total lack of neccessity in    introducing the subject of &quot;slavery&quot; into the story. This sub-    sub plot is very incoherent and jars terribly with the    overall story and also takes away some of the pleasures of    enjoying this supposedly light-hearted romance. Also, since    the &quot;issue&quot; is left &quot;hanging&quot; (unresolved) in the end after    its brutal introduction, what's the point of the director    introducing it in the first place?<br />2) The few scenes in which Fanny Price literally &quot;speaks&quot;    to the camera is truly irritating and unreal. A voice-over    would've been preferred so that the effect is more believable    and doesn't seem as &quot;weird&quot;.<br />3) I can't understand why the Fanny Price here (who's sweet-    natured, kindly and charming throughout the movie) all of a    sudden exhibits a Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde personality during the    LAST scene, when she LOOKS triumphantly (and with an almost    evil-like smile) into the camera while in the arms of the man    she finally secures. Weird.<br />This movie would've been perfect with such an able cast and a great Austen classic to adapt from, but under the direction of Patricia Rozema (who unfortunately also adapted the screenplay), the movie is reduced to just another average and unmemorable period piece which fails to soar.
078322737X|5.0|I'll love and protect this movie until death do us part.  &quot;American Graffiti&quot; is one of my all-time favorite movies, if not most favorite.  It's just so great that it's incredible, it's just about perfect.  It's one of the most honest unpretentious depictions of youth in the history of the movies or of any other art form.  All of the characters in the movie are almost too real to even be in a movie.  George Lucas really is a genius without a doubt, even if he had never done &quot;Star Wars&quot;.  I love this movie so much that I have to see it at least once or twice a week.  It's filled with fun, confusion, conflict, cars, girls, hamburger joints, high school, dancing, music, etc.  Also, I have to say that the cinematography by Haskell Wexler and the cameramen is beautiful, the acting by the entire cast Ron Howard, Harrison Ford, Paul Le Mat, Candy Clarke, Cindy Williams, Richard Dreyfuss, Charles Martin Smith, and everybody else.  The soundtrack is also incredible and revolutionized the way sound and music is used in the movies, sound supervisor Walter Murch, using more than 40 rock'n roll songs to guide the movie instead of a conventional composed score.  Only Martin Scorsese used rock music in a similar way in &quot;Mean Streets&quot; the same year of 1973, however, not to extent of &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. The &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; DVD is great, I highly recommend it to everyone who loves the movies and has a DVD player.  The picture and sound could have been a bit better, but, overall it's very good especially since it's presented in it's original aspect ratio in widescreen so you can see the entire picture.  Also, it has a great making of documentary that includes a wealth of information on all aspects of the movie's production, as well as interviews with George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Walter Murch, and all of the stars of the movie, and more great stuff.  There are also some other bonus information on the people involved and the production, and the theatrical trailer. Get this DVD, if you're not sure about putting up a few bucks, than rent it first and decide for yourself afterwards.   This movie is a genuine gem and a blessing, I'd like to thank everyone involved in making &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and for the priveledge of being able to see it on DVD as many times as I want to.  It's too bad that all of the movies that tried to copy and immitate this movie ever since aren't even half as good.
0679879269|4.0|It was interesting, each book in this trilogy was of an entirely different sort. The Golden Compass was a highly spun story, but bore more direct resemblance to a fairy tale, with few gory details to pull you down, and the symbolism of Dust was so far off it had no real pertinence. The Subtle Knife was more direct, more intimate, it involved the world directly, Will's and Mary Malone's situations brought a riveting focus to it...more drama entered into this one as well, and some of the symbolism came out more, but at the time I was too young and it only sufficed to confuse me. Although the Sublte Knife was different from the Golden Compass, both books bore more resemblance to one another than to the last. The Amber Spyglass (and this instrument played far less of a role in the plot line than did the other two dark materials) was a thing unto itself, and the scope of it was broader, stranger, amazingly well written. Most, but not all elements were resolved, a few inconsistencies blossomed, but it was a good and startling read. Finally though, in finding out the significance of Dust and the place of Lord Asriel and the Authority and all that, I admire Pullman's course of symbolism, which is well-wrought into the book, and I admire his strikingly reavealed message, but I just think he has the message wrong. By his exeptionally well-done Ruby in the Smoke, etc. trilogy, he makes smaller, bejewelled gorgeous meanings known in just as striking but far subtler ways. Yet, here, especially at the end, it was anything but subtle, even ludicrous. Though supposed to be dramatic, his details that were so riveting fell away into corny pseudo-edenesque obscurity...I think my favorite of the three was the subtle knife, because it was well, subtle. And I really loved the kind of unaware, unconfessed, but active bond between Lyra and Will rather than the gooshy fruit-eating that made me a little more than vaguely queasy. Pullman is a master of the dramatic epic, but as for the moralallegory, I don't think he quite hit the mark. Has to get Serafina Pekkala and her witches doing a little more target practice :)
0385484518|5.0|Through his death, an old profesor from Brandeis University left behind a journey towards the way life should be led in order to prepare for death. The true story of Morrie Schwartz is told in the heart touching book Tuesdays with Morrie by his own student and friend Mitch Albom. In Morrie's last months, he and Mitch met to discuss the topic of life and Mitch compiled their meetings together to become this book. After reading this great story, readers will feel like going out and fixing the things in their life that may leave them unsatisfied if they die tomorrow. Because the book contained actual conversations and was written by a close friend of Morrie's, readers actually will feel as if thay have a relationship with him. Morrie was a great man who got this horrible disease and it was no secret that he was going to die, but he never felt sorry for himself, but rather lucky he was left with the time he had. Morrie is an inspirational character who I will continue to think about for a great period of time. Although the ending of the story is no surprise, after reading the good-byes between Mitch and Morrie, it would take a heart less person to have dry eyes. I don't suggest reading this book without a tissue box nearby. Morrie believed an individual life does not just end because of a death, but that through love, the person can live on. Through Mitch's love, Morrie will never be forgotten and will live on in the hearts of the readers of this moving story.
B0000203YT|3.0|How this movie beat out the likes of &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; to win the Best Picture academy award is baffling. It has its moments, but this thing is FAR too long. 45 minutes of this movie is continuous recitation of the characters' lines in the play. &quot;Titanic&quot; was the most overrated movie of all time, but this is pretty close. Gwyneth Paltrow was superb and may actually deserve her Best Actress award. Rupert Everett (Christopher Marlowe) was fantastic as well and probably would have performed the role of Will much better than Fiennes' minimal attempt. The scenery gets a good grade too, but there's nothing else in this movie that deserves a decent comment. It may have deserved a Best Picture nomination because the year gave us such a poor collection of decent shows, but it definitely did not deserve to beat out &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;.
B000050FEN|5.0|If you're a fan of the movie Seven, you owe it to yourself to check out this superb double-disc.  It's absolutely chock-full of supplements, with amazing attention to detail.  Four separate commentary tracks provide great insight into the making of the film, as do the featurettes showing what went into producing both John Doe's photographs and the police crime scene photos in the film. There's also a great short feature showing exactly how much work went into creating John Doe's notebooks, which is especially amazing considering how briefly they were featured in the film itself.<br />And speaking of the film itself, it looks and sounds simply stunning on this new DVD.  My wife and I have had the VHS video of the film for some time, and when we got the DVD we put each in their respective players and cued them up to the same scenes, flipping back and forth from one to the other.  The next day, we sold the VHS copy to a used record store in town.  'Nuff said.
0792156684|3.0|I still don't see why anyone thinks this is one of the best movies ever. This is a good movie, not a great one. The screenplay was simply ridiculous. It doesn't even look like the inside or outside of a ship. It actually LOOKS like a stage!<br />Leonardo was terrible. He made no attempt at playing a young punk. He simply played himself. He was magnificent in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but hasn't done anything since worth watching. He's simply a pretty-boy who cannot play this type of role.<br />This film is filled with lots of good actors in pathetic roles. Kathy Bates is one of my favorites, but her character in this was horrible. It represented absolutely nothing, had no substance, and was completely fictional.<br />Fictional...that's what this movie was. From the start, the &quot;foggy&quot; appearance of the movie, which was supposed to give you the illusion of the early teens, just made the movie look like poorly-drawn animation. This was obviously an attempt at making a classic. This is a recipe for disaster. Classics were never meant to be classics. They were meant to be movies. Try making a good movie, and it might become a classic. Try making a classic, and its lack of substance will cause it to break apart into tiny little pieces.<br />The good thing about the movie was the final scene in the water. This was a marvelous job by DiCaprio and Winslet.<br />Unfortunately, this was just another example of the public being sucked into an extremely high-budget, over-publicized pathetic movie.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Brian Singer did a fantastic job with bringing the X-Men to the silver screen. He definitely followed in the footsteps of tim Burton, Batman &amp; Batman Returns. Whenever comic books are made into movies, they always fail when they try to be a comic book, i.e. - Batman &amp; Robin. Singer kept the characters real and human. As silly as Wolverine's haircut is, I owuld never have it, one can't help but believe it and accept it as real. This movie has excellent, but far inbetween,action sequences. Less is definitely more here. The character development of Magnetto, Wolverine, and Rogue was fantastic. The special effects were fabulous. Anyone who likes an action movie with a story and real plot, i reccomend buying purchasing it.
B00004WIBW|4.0|This was the best 1800 scenery and costumes I've ever seen in a movie. Combined with the clever use/lack of color, they conjured up an image of precisely what we would think 1800 New England would look and feel like.<br />The worst thing about the movie was the music. It was quite dreadful and lacked any sort of synchronization with the ongoing plot. Mystery music continued through the comical scenes so much that it confuses the watcher and almost hides the comedy itself. It did very little to strengthen the plot and most of the scenes could have done without music entirely as the scenery, color, sound, plot, and acting were more than capable of sustaining the movie's quality.<br />I really didn't know what to expect when going into this. Some critics bashed it for not sticking to the book and others praised the costumes and scenery. I don't see the veering from the book's plot a weakness at all. In fact, it was much more entertaining and satisfying than the original.<br />I was a bit confused about Ichabod Crane's character and personality. Although Depp appeared to play what was directed, the character itself seemed to lack the intelligence, experience, and couth you'd expect from the character in the original story. But alas, this is a rewrite, so I probably should not criticize for this.<br />Christina Ricci (Katrina) definitely shows promise although she appeared to lack enthusiasm. For that much money, you would expect her to be able to &quot;fake it&quot;, but it was still a decent job. Miranda Richardson (Lady Van Tassel) had some good moments, but she also lacked enthusiasm and seemed very distant at times. She has proven worthy with perfect performances in &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.<br />Fabulous performances by all of the members on the town's council, but Jeffrey Jones is still stuck in my head as &quot;Charles Deitz&quot; in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;.<br />Christopher Walken was absolutely incredible and easily stole the show!! Don't worry, you won't miss him. He was a perfect choice for the role and will be the face to remember the movie by (Sorry Johnny).
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|Batman &amp; Robin, The Lost World, The Klumps, and definetily Scary Movie are all movies that have never should've been made.  I will admit that I watched the whole movie, not because it interested me, but because I was waiting for the funny part.  To my avail, I did laugh once, with 2 minutes remaining in the movie. Keenan Ivory Wayans is a very funny person, I remember watching In Living color, and it was hysterical.  But with Scary Movie, he seemed to forgot to add laughter to the movie.  I understand that it is a parody, but paradies can be very funny (Spaceballs) or terrible (Mafia).  Scary Movie falls into the same class as Mafia.  My biggest problem with this parody, is the fact that it is a parody of a parody.  As I recall, Scream was a parody of scary movies.  Scream pulled it off because it was a scary movie within a scary movie.  Scary Movie on the other hand, is a stupid movie within a stupid movie.  I wish I could get reimbursed for my money and time that I spent on watching the movie. If anyone out there can explain to me how Scary Movie raked in $150 million at the box office, I would love to know the answer, because I don't have it.
0792846338|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It seems so real, it's creepy. This is the best adoption from a book ever done. Kathy Bates is simply remarkable in her mood swings. She makes you live the life of Paul Sheldon himself. You feel every bit of pain, frustration, and rage that he feels.<br />There's not too much I can say about this movie without giving away some of the plot. But when a movie contains only two actors and the setting for the entire movie is one house, and the movie is this good, you know you have something special. This is top-rate acting. You won't find any better than these two. It's a shame that Kathy Bates had to lower herself to the &quot;Titanic&quot; standards, but I guess the money was just irresistable. But anyway, &quot;Misery&quot; is one of the top 20 movies ever made. As far as suspense goes, it doesn't get any better than this.<br />Warning: Not for children under 16 or ANYONE with a weak stomach. This movie is excellent in its portrayal of the pain of real life. If you can't take it, don't watch it.

0790734850|5.0|This movie has got it all. A dirty tale about corruption, scandals, prostitution, backstabbing, and all sorts of other sinful things. The acting is convincing and great all around-- Spacey, Pearce, Crowe, Cromwell. I would give them all an Oscar if I could. Basinger was good but I don't believe she deserved an Oscar. The direction was fantastic. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is a classic, it went beyond my expectations, and I'll admit I was a bit skeptical of a modern film noir. The somewhat intricate plot moved very swiftly and the mystery of it keeps you guessing. In short, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is a classic, unpredictable, well-acted, well-directed, action-packed film. It's also without a doubt the best movie of 1997.

078322737X|5.0|A great movie, It's defenatly my favorite,ive seen it about 10 times so far.  My dad told me about it, it was his favorite show.  My favorite charachter is John Milner(Paul Lemat), he is the best.  The music is great, it's The old time of rock and roll. Not any of that new rap or heavy metal stuff.  Its a movie that just lights you up.  I think all the actors did a awsome job.  It was probaly Paul Lemats best.  I think another great part of the movie is that some famous stars today were just starting out, like Harrison Ford or Richard Dryfus,and Ron Howard.  The plot is basicly teenagers after graduation just staying out and having a fun time, like all night.  Is it exciting you ask? Are you kidding!  Fighting ,fast cars, custum hotrods,dancing, true love, drag racing, freindship, hold ups. A lot of good stuff.  It's a realy entertaning show.  I thank every one who made it or helped make it. I would like to see another sequel.

B000002JNJ|5.0|These guys think that they are so bad...well, I think that their music is bad, but I am giving it 5 stars just to spite everyone.  So what if the lead singer died and came back...he could never steal my shoes!  These guys are sellouts...if you want to listen to REAL metal, listen to Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach.  I'm going to go throw some gutters...ROCKSTEDDY!
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is in a class of it's own its as though a hand from the underworld reached out and digitally remastered this cd. With its rythmic melodic trance carrying me away into the unknown and feeding me with fatal gestures.<br />Subliminal Messages fill this Cd with words whispered, spoken backwards and loud heart thumping beats thats leave more than a story full essay on my mind. Anything recorded backwards is automatically recorded into our subconscious forward without us even realising!! The rythmic beat puts me into a easy relaxed trance which makes me willing want to fulfill my needs which once were wants. For example:<br />1)Stinkfist: @ 35 sec into the track has 1 bar or word spoken  backwards same thing @ 1min 38 which is very difficult to disipher but i can maybe translate to &quot;listen to the words or die&quot; then out loud speaks &quot;if your happiness means anything to you, lie steal cheat and something?&quot; Which the mind replaces with a fear of and then is later programmed into the mind which will be in a trance like state.<br />2) Eulogy: First opening bars is very trancey and opens up the Third Eye, with great pain. Like a surgical instrument is piercing and then comments about irrelevant thinking which prevents this this third eye from opening. THis conscious thought pattern is being erased and we say goodbye to our consciousness or original thinking pattern. And we will miss him wont we? It all seems very funny, this is because of the distorted guitar which increases a wavelenth in our brain and a chemical called serotonin.  THEN::: Whilst we are willingly receptable we are programmed @4:35 with a backwards message which is read forward into the subconscious, subliminal message if you ask me. Im just guessing but it sounds a little like arabic backards. If you translate this its is something like you must willingly give up your soul to me or die.Then @ 5:35 there is a series of backwards sounds that push this message deeper deeper into the subconscious. &quot;I need someone to lead me and tell me what to think&quot; is the next impression i get. And then tries to relate to you with saddness with peolpe who have let us down, then changes to our consciousness thinking which will always let us down. Permanent saddness every time we think and then quickly changes to anger. The rest of the CD harnessess on raw anger. Promoting a blind fury which conceals what is about to happen.<br />3) H: Starts off with anger then is suppressed with pushing it deep creating a false sense of calm andjust before you question it and realise this the lyrics state: &quot;What is coming through is a lie&quot; meaning you will now be confused in your emotions and start to doubt your own judgement hence loose your self esteem. This will reflect in what you do. You open up your heart chakra to this song and then the rythem, like a sweet gravitational pull causes your aura to flip inside out and wave up and down in a wave like motion always propelling you forward.It locks you out of your own body without fear and if you want to cry then you will not be able to respond to your heart and this negative emotion will be built up and then translated into anger. Until you start to get so so angry that you slip away from what you used to be.<br />4) USEFUL IDIOT and 46&amp; 2: You now have become a useful idiot, a CLONE of society. Modelled yourself into a confused person who is now lost. Always walking with yor head in the darkness following your shadow meaning you are always looking the way you came and never forward into the future or towards a bright future, sunlight? This promotes paranoia. You want it. You want a change so bad now that it doesnt matter if it is a change for the worse. The 46&amp;2 will symbolise you irradic sleeping patterns and the numbers are a code for your subconscious to reply to. If i hear these numbers in my subconscious then i know they are trying to help me and the rhythm carries a certain type of signature thatis ingrained at the end of the track.<br />8) INTERMISSION: Remember at the movies when they flash a coke logo so fast that even thou you didnt see it is registered by your eyes then you get up and then buy one?<br />9) JIMMY: I still dont know the significance of 11 in this track. Maybe it represents the twilight hour when the gateway to the underworld opens and is deposited into out soul centre. THis is particularily useful if you play this track on October 31st. The representation of 3+1=4 4= the number for the gateway to the underworld. Being led by a little light hand in hand to the world of the underland and being left there, never to return. Dammned to live in constant darkness.<br />10) DIE EIER VON SATAN: Well i dont understant German, but my subconsciou has the power to access this certain knowledge. Many bars backwards. You can tell this by the differing background noise but the crowds cheering constantly going forwards; eg @1:31 maybe? Can anyone who speak German even understan this or is it dead Latin? Somethin suss here... <br /> 11)PUSHIT:If you try to fight back you will be pushed back. &quot;Why shit on Me?&quot; If you interested to know what the fly sounds are in the background are for then check out: [...] <br />It all seems like a SciFi movie? @8:58 Another way opens a dorway into a mind on the other side of the world and opens up a new set of programming. Read the above if you want to know but a trap doorway has been installed into your mind ending in suicide if you dont comply to the hypnotists wishes. Hypnoitist can hypnotise from a few metres or a few thousand kilometres, it doesnt matter, as long as you are receptive and willingingly allow yourself to be influenced.<br />13) AENIMA: Doesn't this mean brain hemerrorage?? Too much worrying can cause this..especially excessive anger. My sister was hospitalised with a stomach ulcer because she worried so much!! You need a release of your anger. Take up Martial Arts to focus and harness your rawemotion, dont take up crime!! Mommy wont fix it, so dont give up on yourself.<br /> 14)NEGATIVE IONS: Is a classic case of subliminal programming called NSP. Neurolistic Programming which really stuffs up your programming of how you remember things and when and how, it all gets mixed up in here. Total anger, total confusion.<br />15)THIRD EYE: Finally the closure of yor third eye. The reprogramming has finished with the message that drugs are OK and very relaxing. And if you cant stand the anger anymore than the only option you have is to get high, as the guitar riff takes you. The only way to know if you have been affected is to relax, meditate or to open your third eye and be hypnotised.  But HEEEEEEYYYYY!!! the CD ends with a fatal warning. Just you try and onen your third eye and you will oen a doorway into your subconscious that you will not be able to control. A pandorias box if you will.....<br />Apart from all that i love th CD and i cant wait for the next one.
0380002930|5.0|I have started reading this book about two weeks ago.  I am not done, but for the first time have I ever laid eyes on a book so full of adventure and character.  This book is very intresting and has alot of my vocabulary words which really gets me thinking .  Watership Down is the first book that really gets me focused.  I love it and wish to read more of Richard Adam's books.
B00000J7J4|2.0|Very briefly...for me, this album just did not measure up to the early Santana albums.  All of those great, dark Latin rhythms and energies just don't show up in this collection of pop tunes.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I liked some songs from Limp Bizkit's last CD, but I wasn't quite pursuaded to buy it. But &quot;Rollin&quot; from their new cd really influenced me to buy this new CD and I'm glad I did.  This a great CD and the music is really awesome. The lyrics are funny and interesting and the beats are off tha hook!!  This is a great CD to add to your collection!
0060987464|5.0|I was always a Manson fan, I was just always into that sort of thing...the darker side of human culture, perhaps it was merely a sub concious thought that drew me to his music because years later when I started to read deeper into the words in his music I realized what a certified genius this man was so I picked up the book and began reading it, was one of the last people around me to have read it, but It was one of the few books that I just cannot put down, hours of sleep deprivation went into this book.  It gave me an understanding to the mans life that I never could have gotten through his wonderful yet cryptic music but thats alright because he is talented that way.  Its true that I want to get into a musical career and its true that I am a bit dark and these things could contribute to why I loved the book so much but for the sake of it I think it was well written.  Very well written,  probably more so now that he has been through what he has by getting his music career going.  I dont see how most people can read this book and still not understand what this man is trying to do in his life because he explains himself so openly and so innocently in his morbid own way.  Marilyn Manson is truly one of the more creative and evolved human beings on this earth and everyone who hates him should understand that they are partially responsible for his presence here, and If they would read this book, maybe they wouldnt be so stupid; too bad that influence doesnt change people, people change themselves.  This is a wonderful book, I cannot wait for his next book &quot;Holy Wood&quot; coming out sometime in February 2001, I recommend this book to basically, well, anyone; which is why I gave my copy to a friend this last Christmas.  Meaning Ill have to purchase another copy, lol.  This book has been Sincerely recommended by; The Viral InfectioN.

How about the existential angst of the darkest Pink Floyd meets the wildest sonic assault of earliest King Crimson with Peter Hammill trying to be the &quot;Hendrix of the voice&quot; on top of it all and singing profound lyrics at that. If that description appeals to you at all, purchase immediately!
B000003TAW|5.0|lets see, its been nearly 5 years since i first heard buddy holly on the radio, and today, i love weezer more than ever. how much do i love them? i live in minnesota, and this past summer i drove 36 hours to see them (uh huh, all the way to phoenix). it was well worth it. even though my favorite weezer song (suzanne) isn't on this album, this is my favorite weezer album, and the best that i own (along with nirvana unplugged). i'm gonna cut this short because its 3 a.m., but get this album, and if you like it, pick up nada surf (high/low) and the presidents of the united states of america (self titles), ohh yeah, get the other weezer cd too!!
B000003TAW|5.0|I originally bought this album for Buddy Holly and Undone, and came to like Say It Ain't So soon afterwards.  Now I love every song. When I listen to CD's at first I tend to pick out the good tracks right away and stray from the rest.  This album is chock full of good tracks.  You just can't help but sing along to every song on it. This is a really talented band.  I can't wait for their new CD.
6305627401|5.0|If you are not easily offended, or looking for some laughs rent this movie and if you love it buy it. The movie is different than the tv show. If you like the movie try the tv show{which is funnier than Beavis and Butthead. The tv show uses both toliet and witty humor.
1879557541|4.0|The book is a monumental work and goes were few books I have ever read have.  It challenges a lot of cherished myths, challenges tradional worldviews, and egocentric prejudices which good science usually does.  Its short coming is that the book is slow and tedious to read, at least for non-acemdemic like myself.
B00000J1YS|5.0|Ok boys and girls and all of you dire straits's fans here's  one of dire straits's best cd's. love over gold combins some of dire straits's most famous classics and even some new material wich wosent published in any one of their other cd's like &quot;telegraph road&quot; (my favorite by the way) and others. as always mark knofler's stratocaster guitar solos are exelent. i strongly reccomend this cd to anyone and everione.
B00004Z311|5.0|For fans of the fantasy genre, it is hard to find a good film that represents what they enjoy so much, but Legend is that film. It truly has the spirit of fantasy, and very well-done fairy tale elements as well, and if I had to describe the movie I could simply use one word; enchanting. The sets are absolutely breath-taking, and when you've seen it as many times as I have the dialogue becomes like a favorite song that you can recite right along with the characters. I must have seen this movie a billion times since its theatrical release (when I was only 4). Quite simply, there is no fantasy film to match it, and this is a showcase of director Ridley Scott's brilliance, which lead to what I see as his magnum opus, Gladiator. There's just no describing this film. If you're a fantasy fan, this is for you. You can do no better.
0805062971|4.0|It's an intriguing story. Everyone seems to agree that Palahniuk's 'Fight Club' warns of the evils of consumerism and over-emphasis on the self. So what this Fight Club is, it's a crude and brutal and bloody support group for disaffected young men. In fact it's not much different to the cancer support groups frequented by Tyler Durden, the book's main character, where he meets Marla Singer, the woman with whom he shares a love-hate affair. <br />Instead of comforting one another with hugs and sob stories, young 20-something men pummel each other until what's left of themselves is a broken and bleeding mess. What this Fight Club is all about, is the realization that everything we own, everything we wear, everything about our sorry commodifed existence means nothing.<br />That's my take, and quite frankly it's a bit extreme. It's enjoyable as fodder for discussion but 'Fight Club' seems to disregard everything we space monkeys have achieved for the past thousand years or so. There's always been a class structure, there have always been the rich and poor and the people in between. The thought of overthrowing our society's upper class is a delicious fantasy. Except it's just so 21st century. And anarchy? Quite fun in theory but let's get realistic. Rich in irony, a lot of the elements in Fight Club are clever because they're just allegory.<br />Please read Fight Club. It's a thoughtful and profound book. This author has got a ton of interesting ideas and a dark sense of humour. But don't take it too seriously, OK? I like Palahniuks rapid and lean writing style. Quite ironically, this book is really short so I read it in one day and then threw it on my desk. You are not the books you read.
B000002LQR|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers can change their style from funky, rapping lyrics, to more thoughful slower songs on the same CD and have it all sound good.  Many of the songs fron Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik I never realized were all the back from 1991 when hearing them on the radio, their music is the timeless stuff that just doesn't get old!  A few of my favorite tracks are Breaking the Girl, and Give it Away.  There's some tight guitar lines backed up by Flea's confident bass playing.  This CD's a lot different than the newest one, Californication, but its just as good in its own way!
6305750750|2.0|1. The Empire Strikes Back (5 STARS)<br />2. Return of the Jedi (4 STARS)<br />3. A New Hope (3.5 STARS)<br />4. The Phantom Menace (2 STARS)
B0000041Z6|5.0|1st Of All this is a low-price Box,London,Solti,i think  we can find better Performances with BERNSTEIN for Sure, Especially in the Second,but in fact solti's conducting is amazing,the orchestra is playing very well under this Great Conductor,The London-Decca Recording is superb!<br />The Heart of this Box is The Symphony No.8,it is one of the best recording of this symphony with Great Singers. To my Mind,also the Orchestra is playing as well as Mahler wanted in  this symphony!<br />IN the end You will not regret buying this BOX,but keep in mind that if you buy the LEONARD BERNSTEIN New Box Set With DG,you will have Truly The Reference Performances for Mahler Symphonies.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I know that not many guys will take a listen to this and much less take the time to review it, but it's REAL good. I listen to mostly heavy music like TOOL, A Perfect Circle, and Led Zeppelin. This normally wouldn't be something I would pick up to give a try, but a female friend of mine suggested it and I heard Dido in the Eminem song &quot;Stan.&quot; It's great album, and I'm glad that I picked it up...and you will be too.
B00004XQ83|5.0|You'll have to look at the other extensive reviews already here if you want to know why this music is so great--the reason I gave this CD 5 stars because every single song in the movie is actually on this disc! 2000 was a disappointing year for soundtrack fans who wanted to buy the music from their favorite movies, since most soundtrack producers dumbed-down and sold out the soundtracks to give us the most commercial, least interesting songs from the films. The &quot;O Brother&quot; producers respected us enough to think maybe the reason we're buying the soundtrack is to (surprise!) hear the actual music from the film.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I luv this album. I think that Eminem's point of view is amazing and his rapping talents are awsome. I think that the way he disses whoever he wants to in his songs is phat. Eminem is a very talented rapper, who speaks his mind and happens to be really really hot.
B00004XOWM|3.0|I think this CD is good but not nearly as good as &quot;Significant Other.&quot;  The best songs are &quot;Rollin&quot;, &quot;Getcha Groove on&quot;, the &quot;MI2 Theme Song&quot;, and &quot;My Generation.&quot;  The others are not all that great.  I only suggest getting this CD if you are a avid Limp Bizkit fan.
B00003CXE7|4.0|A spectacular movie with wonderful extras on the disc, this is one for the collection.  Without recycling the same ideas already stated some 500 times before me, I'd like to add that what is wonderful about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in particular is that he doesn't simply make his character fall into the typical villain stereotypes, but rather provides his Commodus with a depth and resourcefulness that make him truly understandable.  Treacherous and menacing he may be, but the new Emperor is also wounded, emotionally, perhaps more deeply than any other character in the film.  His character might have been the focus of a movie which aimed at creating Shakespeareanesque tragedy rather than heroic epic.  The plot, of course, demands resolution in traditional style, but Phoenix does not allow the complexity of Commodus' character to be lost.  Bravo!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is the greatest dvd to buy. If u are a real dvd fan like me u must buy it, if u just got a dvd player and aren't really a hardcore dvd fan, u must buy it.  I'm telling u this is the dvd to own.  First of all this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen, it is so incredibly original, yet true.  I mean everyone was all wrapped in the matrix hype, including me, but this movie actually has a lot of truth.  I won't get into detail, but u must see this movie!! It has awesome directing, great acting and a killer story, what else can i say?! The dvd is absolutey spectacular. Awesome format and the quality of the picture and sound is superb.  Than there is all of the kewl extras u will find.  They really have some kewl things in the dvd package, unlike lots of other dvd's where they want to add as much extra's as possible, most being complete crap.  All i know is u must own this dvd, like i already haven't said it enough.
B00004SCX6|5.0|There isn't anything that isn't perfect in this cd. She sends a good message, has a soothing voice, and is the most strikingly incredibly unbelievably hot person that I have ever seen, easily. Her songs are about friendships and relationships and all of the songs send the right message: that caring about others and concern for others defines true relationships. Her lyrics are very catchy, and original. She is a very hard worker and is very deservant of her success. <br />... Britney is head and shoulders above christina aguilera because she is a better overall person with substantially more success.<br />Like many others, I am obsessed with Britney, but because she is sweet and caring and extremely attractive and not for other more common reasons.
B000002J1F|5.0|I remember cutting class and going to the record shop and buying the original eight track. I wasn't sure if I should get the YES ALBUM or FRAGILE. Since Roundabout WAS on this one I got it. Heart of the Sunrise remains my second most favorite song of all time. (The first being Todd Rundgren's UTOPIA). As much as I listened to YES in those days this is the only album I can listen to now. It holds up. Remember, it is 30 years old. Ten minute songs were the thing then. If you have never heard this recording and are thinking of trying it .. have an open mind. Bill Brufford's playing was jazzy at times as is/was the most under-rated member of YES. I was rediculed for listening to this and playing it for the passangers in my car. Closed minded people will not like the music found here. I say to them &quot;Kuso Kurai&quot;!
0399146253|3.0|In The Last Precinct, she has written a book that is a complete mess.  The plot manages to be both incomprehensible and predictable -- quite an accomplishment, if you think about it. Many of the characters are one-dimensional, practically none of them are likeable, and their motivations are obscure or unbelievable.  For all that, the book is very readable, and I actually enjoyed it.  Go figure.
B00004TR2G|5.0|are talking about!  Jaws: The Anniversary Collector's Edition is by far the best release of this classic score.  When I bought the original, thinking I was buying this one, I discovered the original release was a mere 30 minutes!  Not only that, but some of my favorite parts were ommited!  But now, the listener has a complete library of every track heard in the film that's worth listening to (and that's everything)!  What you hear on this release are the original tapes of the film (that is to say, that the music you hear was the exact music used in the film).  Although not in chronological order, there are several high points to this disc.  Tracks such as the Kintner boy's death, the shark attack at the pier, the tender music between Brody and son, and much of the lost Orca music has been reinstated.  Although now and again you hear the weakness of analog recording, I can't say I haven't heard the same sort of distracting noise on the original re-recording.  Also, it contains an impressive little booklet, and comes in an attractive little jewelcase.  If you want a Jaws soundtrack, this is the one to get.  I would also highly recommend Jaws 2, for an interesting and enjoyable new spin on the classic music that has become so crucial to Americana.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Pet Sounds is great. There is no more soothing yet disturbing sound than Brian Wilson on this album. I had heard about this album for years and wondered what the big deal is. To me, the Beach Boys never seemed all that great, and I couldn't see how someone who wrote &quot;California Girls&quot; could be considered a genius. Yet, after listening to songs such as &quot;That's Not Me,&quot; &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;I'm Waiting for the Day,&quot; I understand. Wilson &amp; Co., I salute you (sans Carnie and Wendy, of course). Wonderful, emotional stuff.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing recording. It was the 2nd CD I ever bought for myself, now I have over 50 and it is still most definitely in my top 5. Do not be put off by stories and rumours you hear about Marilyn, most aren't true, but that doesn't matter, the music is astounding!! The Album is like a novel, and each song another chapter - it starts with a semi-prologue in Irresponsible Hate Anthem, a taste of more to come if you like (interestingly, the liner states it was recorded live on Valentines Day 1997, about 6 months after its release??). Further into the story, The Beautiful People (the hit single) tells about the central character's childhood (reminiscent of Manson's own). Track 3, Dried Up Tied And Dead To The World, is a great song who's power comes from the great guitar riffs by Twiggy on bass. Tourniquet is most definitely my favourite song on the album (if not all time) - it is THE ONE to listen to. It is a sad/angry song about the character wanting love and making a lover in a Frankenstein-ish manner. The next episode in Little Horn is a hard, heavy and fast song that doesn't hold back on the content - the anger of his 'childhood' is coming back to haunt him.  Cryptorchid... well its just there, sad and ever so slightly electronic. Deformography is my least favourite song, but still ain't bad. It introduces another character (i think, can't remember) who is influencing our hero.  Wormboy is a reflective piece, which takes everyone's favourite Antichrist to stardom, a saviour.  Mr Superstar tells the story of the fans of the Antichrist who would kill him just to touch him, it highlights the irony of their 'worship'.  I'm bored with writing all this so I'll fast-track to the end.... Angel with the Scabbed Wings - EXCELLENT! Kinderfeld - slow and sad. Antichrist Superstar - The end is in sight with this excellent rock song, 1996 - hard and heavy not to be missed.  Minute Of Decay - The climax has been reached, our hero is dying, everybody who loved himnow despises the sight of him - makes you want to cry.  The Reflecting God - picks the pace up a bit, his last struggle to survive is thwarted, suicide is hinted at. The Man That You Fear - what an excellent ending to the 'novel', an acoustic requiem telling why he died like he did and what he really wanted. Amazing stuff. Marilyn is really amazing with his vocals. Some say it is either moaning or screaming, but if you really listen, you can tell the emotion he puts into his music. Is it there just to sell records? Who knows, but boy does it make for good listening. Another interesting point is the way recurring themes are used, something not often seen since David Bowie or Pink Floyd. Tracks 17-98 are 4 seconds of silence, and track 99 (appropriately named &quot;Track 99&quot;) picks up from The Man That You Fear and links it back to Irresponsible Hate Anthem so well that it will make you want to listen to it over and over again. Every song is a gem, making this an essential CD in any fan of Alternative music's collection. BUY IT NOW!! Essential songs: Tourniquet, The Beautiful People, Angel With Scabbed Wings, Antichrist Superstar, The Reflecting God, and The Man That You Fear.
B000002BMD|5.0|The Manics have had limited exposure and success in the States.  For those who fear the systematic overplay and destruction that US corporate radio has embraced, this is a blessing.  For those who have missed the opportunity to hear one of the UK's best treasures, this is truly unfortunate.  From start to finish, this CD tackles issues and chords aggressively (though certainly less so than previous releases) while producing a work that is clean, crisp and melodic.  Rest assured, the depth of the somewhat vague (Richey) lyrics and melodramatic sounds may require a few extra runs through the songs, but in the end you will pat yourself on the back for many years to come for this purchase.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The review from &quot;Penaltyshot&quot; who gave it 2 stars because of the poor sequencing is valid and should be listened to, and I agree with him/her to a certain point. If you don't know much about the Beatles, or don't have any albums of theirs, what better place to start. Agreed, it is a compilation which destroys the entire purpose of sequencing the tracks, but you can't ignore the fact that every single song on the CD is excellent and could quite easily make any &quot;all time top 100 songs&quot;. Buy this CD now!!
B00003CX9W|5.0|The original Fantasia is an undeniable masterpiece, and in bringing it to the digital medium, Disney has done the best job possible under the circumstances. The visuals are stunning (making the VHS practically unwatchable), and I am still amazed at the fidelity of the orginal soundtrack (probably one of the first to be recorded on to magnetic tape, hence the crispness). The long forgotten intermission has also been included, which really gives the film the feeling of a concert. However, for the DVD, Disney made a bold move. For the sake of completeness, the narration in between pieces has been fully restored, and in some cases is over twice the length of the original. To accomodate this Deems Taylor's VOICE has been dubbed over by a similar voice reading his words verbatim. Apparently, the audio portion of the restored segments was unsalvagable, and the re-dubbing was done for consistentcies sake. Too bad. The only other discrepency, was that the classic art-decoesque &quot;Fantasia&quot; title that flashes on the screen before the curtain opens is GONE. Perhaps that was not part of the original cut.
B00003CX8J|3.0|I was never much of a fan of the X-Men comic book (I'm waiting for the live-action Spider-Man movie next year), but I have the admit the creators of this film did a pretty good job.  The story is intelligent and fairly interesting.  The special effects are impressive without being overbearing, as they were in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.  I did find the Rogue character a bit dull.  Wolverine is the standout of the picture, with his wisecracking attitude and ferocious fighting style.  The DVD edition has plenty of special features that should keep you busy for a while.
B00004T9UH|4.0|This album is partially edited.  The songs are not recorded over so cuss words will be replaced with clean words; the words that are edited out are strong cuss words.  Is it me or this album does not contain the 1st track-PSA 2000? My CD doesn't.  It just plays a few seconds of silence and then goes on to the 2nd track called &quot;Kill You&quot;.  EMINEM DOES NOT ACTUALLY MURDER PEOPLE IN REAL LIFE! If you want proof listen to the end of the song.  &quot;Stan&quot; feat. Dido, which has a video, is considered as the best song on the album.  It's about an obsessive fan who committed suicide because he thought Eminem didn't care about him.  The 2nd skit is &quot;Paul&quot;.  He just talks about how Dre gave him the new album and hangs up cause he doesn't wanna talk about it.  &quot;I never knew I-I/I never knew I...&quot;Who Knew&quot; is the 6th track.  The 3rd skit is &quot;Steve Berman&quot;, Eminem's manager, who is cussing Eminem out because he thinks his album is horrible and needs to change it or it won't come.  The next track-&quot;The Way I Am&quot; is a sequel to that.  They play the 2nd half of the skit at the beginning of the video.  &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; is the song that a lot Anti-Eminem complained about because of the disses.  (Listen to the 2nd verse).  &quot;Remember Me&quot; has an annoying beginning IMO. &quot;I'm Back&quot; is kinda funny cause of Eminem singing and the lil' kids saying &quot;Slim Shady&quot; in the background of hook. Eminem expresses most of his &quot;opnions&quot; in the next song &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;.  The nasty skit is &quot;Ken Kaniff&quot; who is the biggest *****  on earth, if he's real. &quot;Drug Ballad&quot; is a love song aiight...a song about a love for drugs! &quot;Amityville&quot; starts off with a tight beat. &quot;B**** Please II&quot; is a sequel to &quot;B**** Please II&quot; by Snoop Dogg f/Xzibit &amp; Nate Dogg.  Eminem's version features them &amp; Dr. Dre.  The next track is &quot;The Kids&quot;, it replaced &quot;Kim&quot; for the clean version of this album.  It's a funny South Park (the cartoon) song which has Eminem imitiating the cartoon characters from the cartoon.  He does a good job of it too. My favorite &amp; next track is &quot;Under The Influence&quot; featuring Eminem's new group called D-12.  The last track is &quot;Criminal&quot;, the beginning of the track is a must-listen-to. LOL! Eminem has issues on this album!
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  I love the 70's, and this movie is Crowe's self-proclaimed &quot;kiss&quot; to that time in his life when he was touring with bands as a writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.  His alter ego in the movie, William Miller, is a complete paradox to everything about the rock and roll lifestyle, with the exception of one thing...his love of the music.  This movie made me want to go back to the ticket counter of the theatre, buy another ticket and watch it again. There are so many appealing elements to this movie that it works for men and women.  I highly recommend this movie, even if the DVD is a dud.  Buy the DVD anyway, just for the movie.  It will make you want to see Stillwater in concert for yourself.
6300215814|5.0|I was only 13 when i saw this movie but i fell in love with it at first glance!  I could not wait for it to be shown again on television considering that I did not own it.  Audrey Hepburn is magnificent as Holly Golightly, a young woman trying to fit into the high New York social scene.  There is so much in the air between Audrey and George Peppard in the first scene in Holly's room!  It is so romantic and the plot is just great through out the movie.  The end scene, &quot;a kiss in the rain,&quot; always gets me because it is like a dream.  I could not recomend this enough!  It is such a great movie with a funny, sad, romantic story that is great for all ages and will continue to be a classic.
B000001Y5J|4.0|&quot;Broken&quot; is a very good work of art from Nine Inch Nails, showcasing Trent Reznor's anger and hostility through words, raging guitar riffs, and furious noise. Wereas &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; is more poppy, and &quot;the Downward Spiral&quot; is more industrial, &quot;Broken&quot; is an EP that leans toward rock (with the addition of bits of industrial). The record begins with the growing &quot;Pinion&quot;, an instrumental opening track that grows ever so slowly until it erupts into &quot;Wish&quot;. &quot;Wish&quot; showcases a grinding, angry guitar that is merely a part of the whole song. And when this attack is over, &quot;Last&quot; breaks in like a madman with an ax, Trent Reznor's shouts raging alongside pounding drums and searing guitars. This is followed by the intermission; the instrumental &quot;Help Me I Am In Hell&quot;. Although this track is short, and not as angry as its predecessors, it displays despair and angst without lyrics, but only through sound. Just as it cools down, &quot;Happiness In Slavery&quot; bursts in with a blast. This track is a highlight in the album, proclaiming Trent Reznor's anger and shock at the realization of becoming a &quot;servant&quot;. This song dies down into one of my personal favorite tracks, the hopeless &quot;Gave Up&quot;. After a couple minute break, two hidden tracks are played, &quot;Physical&quot; and &quot;Suck&quot;. &quot;Physical&quot; is the kind of track that sounds almost like a cousin to the hit &quot;Closer&quot;, even though &quot;Physical&quot; was written by Adam Ant. &quot;Suck&quot; kicks in as the finale, a song with electronic pulses and beats. After this, the album is done, and the impact of Nine Inch Nail's rage still embedded in your ear drums. All in all, &quot;Broken&quot; is a sonic assault that mercilessly rages out unlike any of Nine Inch Nails' other albums (but then again, no two NIN records are the same). The album is very good, but too short and not as developed assome of NIN's other works.
B00004YW6I|5.0|\\"... have you ever written a something (a whole song, one line of lyrics, a sheet of guitar tabs) that's not as good as it can be?\\" . this is the first question I would ask to polly jean harvey if I had the option. I will not spend a million words &claim to be able to express how I feel about this album, and why everyone shall own and love it. in pj's words, it's \\"too beautiful, to put into words!\\". it's a strangely, somewhat dazingly, gleeful album, the musical evidence that this exquisite, shy &sharp-teethed lady from dorset can stand and shout and stare and be glamurous even on a rooftop in new york  and, most of all, that she CAN actually ink &perform joyful, dense, provocative songs about love, love &love, without sounding totally sappy and lame.  it's pj harvey, at her best.
0140177396|5.0|Although Of Mice and Men may be considered diminutive when compared to lenghtier tomes like The Grapes of Wrath and War and Peace, it still maintains its message as well as the protracted books do. Of Mice and Men is a poigniant story, relating the unlikely friendship of two people: George, an irascible man with great dreams, and Lenny, a retarded man with immense strenght. Soon, their friendship is tested, as Lenny's naive iniquities impede George's ambitious plans of &quot;living off the fat of the land&quot;. In the remainder of the book, Steinbeck explores the true meaning of friendship and does it remarkable well in Of Mice and Men's few pages.
B000050AMK|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece collection of RHCP, their best song on their new album &quot;Californication&quot; is bundled together in this package with the must for all RHCP fans: a bonus VCD. Yes, that means Video CD. I believe that this video CD is truly a limited edition treasure and should be cherished by all the RHCP listeners who have the honor of buying this album around the world. This is truly something which you should buy. If you don't get this then you aren't a hardcore RHCP fan.
B000002L9Y|4.0|i havent heard this album since i was 8 years old. its extremely soft and you may go as far to say cheesy, but its also very creative and heartfelt. a definite pick me up! like this!
0792151712|5.0|This movie is my favourite of all time. The special effects were awesome, the costumes brilliant, and the acting unforgettable. There were some good actors, like Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, and Kathy Bates, but some needed improving. Leonardo DiCaprio played the role of Jack pretty well, but some of his lines were totally unoriginal. Overall, James Cameron has done a great job, and this movie is - unsinkable.
0800105141|5.0|to judge this movie is like stating the obvious an infinite amount of times. after watching this movie, one should have a moment of silence. one should cry for the evil of men, one should meditate about peacefulness. who cares if the lighting was warm or if anyone got press for the movie who shouldn't have. one should think to themselves...have i inspired anyone lately?, have i helped anyone lately? have i been peaceful myself lately? have i contributed anything worthwhile to society lately? instead of being a critic, lets be more like gandhi himself.
B0000035E7|5.0|If there was ever a &quot;Pre-Quel&quot; in the music industry, this album is it.  BLEACH is the album which true Nirvana/grunge fans bought after hearing Nevermind.  If the only song you were interested in was Teen Spirit, you probably never heard this record and you missed out. The tracks here are of raw power including &quot;Floyd the Barber&quot;, &quot;Mr. Moustache&quot;, &quot;Big Cheese&quot;, and Kurt's prequel to Teen Spirit &quot;Negative Creep&quot;.   In music circles, being a Nirvana fan can liken you to pop music.  But, if you've heard this entire album, you know that Nirvana really created the new music sound that EVERYONE listens to today.
B000000OMJ|5.0|This album appears to be Peter Gabriel's first where all the pieces finally perfectly fit together.  The songs are almost all edgy and disturbing lyrically, but they maintain that pop touch that makes them not just listenable but memorable as well.  The music is well-thought out, and Steve Lillywhite's production makes every track sound superb.  I have to really think to find anything negative to say about this work - &quot;Lead a Normal Life&quot; sounds unfinished, but even at that is pretty good.  The highlights are many - &quot;I Don't Remember&quot;, &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; and my favorite track &quot;Biko&quot; - protest songs are rarely this focused or powerful.  Ideal for just about anyone interested in the power of rock music.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I've been waiting for this CD to come out since last January and I only got it this Christmas, so obviously I built up a lot of expectations. And I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed. Simple, honest lyrics and beautiful, if slightly melancholy tunes create a surprisingly mellow blend that would be pleasurable to any ear. The album loses a point for me because of the lack of contrast between the songs-admittedly I was hoping to find &quot;Stan&quot; on here, complete with Eminem's rapping-and because sadly, the version of &quot;Here With Me&quot; was, I found, not as good as the one on the &quot;Roswell High&quot; credits. However,  I enjoyed the album a lot, and I expect it to be high on my playlist of most well-used CDs this year.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This is a great album!  Christina's voice is even better than on her debut album! Probably the most memorable songs are tracks 1, 2, 3 and 6.  I love the part in O, Holy Night where she recites the Lord's Prayer!  It just sounds so beautiful!  These are the special times is a great remake of Celine Dion's original. The only songs that get on my last nerve are Merry Christmas baby, and especially Xtina's Xmas!  I really don't understand the point of xtina's Xmas at all!  Honestly, I think Silent Night should have taken the place of this filler track.
B00003CWTH|5.0|I think the people who have said that this movie is hard to watch if you can't take emotion hit the nail on the head. This film is emotionally charged, tapping into the strongest feelings that we have: love (whether it be heterosexual or homosexual), loss, and ultimately happiness and reconciliation.<br />I don't understand how reviewers can claim that the movie had no climax or conclusion. I thought it was pretty clear what the climactic moment of the movie was (coughfrogscough).  I heard Philip Seymour Hoffman explain that scene very compellingly. He said that all of these incredibly important, though publicly unrecognized, events were taking place (and they did happen), so it was completely logical to culiminate all of the grief and rage with a sort of ridicualously absurd public plague. The pain in the lives of the characters was so thick and blinding it was almost as though it manifested itself in that scene. And no resolution or &quot;coming together&quot;? Notice how significantly the characters have changed by the end of the film.<br />Another thing that Hoffman said was that he loved playing a &quot;good guy,&quot; someone with real morals and his &quot;ducks all in a row.&quot; Phil isn't the only character like this. The Catholic cop is also a moral person, someone most people would label as a big dork. I think many of the negative reactions to this movie come from a strong distaste for &quot;goodness&quot; that is engrained into our collective psyche. Dysfunction is much cooler. We'd rather watch Lester Burnam lust after a sixteen year old. I admire Anderson for directly confronting this trait of our society. Sure there was a fair share of dysfunction in Magnolia, but Anderson realized that a balanced equation for realism must include goodness as well. I applaud him even more when I think that Anderson must have known that he would be met with the ignorance displayed in many of these reviews. And he made the film anyway. <br />So go watch all of your wonderfully hip stories of losses of innocence and sadness. See if you get any emotional fulmillment. Oh, I forgot, you'd rather not feel any emotion at all.
B000050XEI|5.0|What a wonderful album to relax to! I absolutly enjoy the piano and syths. The song &quot;Wild Child&quot; reminds me of my other favorite and comparable artist's song, Ryan Farish's &quot;Friends&quot;. These two artists emphasizes their work around music that envokes emotion. That is what I cherish from a artist and is what makes me a devoted fan. I have not had the opportuity to listen to Enya's music from the past, but I assure you that I will be waiting for her next after listening to her breathtaking compositions.
0679879269|5.0|First of all, I shall shake my head at those people who say that this book is less than a work of art. I recieved this book for christmas, and read it in one night, all the while marveling at the intricate descriptions and the unique fantasy world that Phillip Pullman has created. The idea of a diamond-shaped skelatal frame for the mulefa, and indeed, the entirity of the mulefa world, are incredibly well concived. This book was so good, and the ending so well written, that I cried at the sheer beauty of the human interactions. The next day, I found myself re-reading the series again, and marveling that such an epic could have such humble beginnings as in the golden compass.<br />I would also like to say, that while I myself have no particular views on religon, my feeling is that those people who feel offended by the &quot;Jesus bashing&quot; should realize that there is more to this series than a &quot;campaign against god.&quot; It is a truly well-written book, and my feeling is that the religous ideals expressed by Phillip Pullman have no effect whatsoever on the sheer emotion of the novel. And to those people who see &quot;serious holes in the plot&quot; try rereading the book. I had a few problems as well, but found they disapeared when put under closer scrutiny.<br />To all potential readers out there, I recommend this book. It's the best one I have read since Where the Red Fern Grows. I wholeheartedly recommend this to all.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|One thing that is good about this album is that for someone like me that does not have any Beales albums- this &quot;1&quot; has it all. For a long time jazz fan that primarly listens to artist like the Yellowjackets, Ryan Farish, and Sade, I can also enjoy this album since it is concentrated with all Beatle hits. What more could you want?  &quot;1&quot; is a MUST BUY!!
B00003CX95|5.0|Since so many people have already written so many great comments, I would just like to say this movie is one of my top 10 movies of all times and everyone should see it!  This DVD version is excellent.  I especially like the special feature - making of Braveheart.
6304639457|4.0|I can't exactly remember when I received the video...either as a birthday or Christmas present, but my son had purchased it for me.  Then a funny thing happened.  I sat it up on a shelf then promptly forgot about it...for almost two years!  Why?  I really don't know.  I liked Fleetwood Mac, at least most of their stuff, but when they broke up it was just another sad link in a long chain of bands that have disappeared from view.  And maybe I didn't watch it because this breakup seemed to be a rather nasty one (Buckingham &amp; Nicks, and the McVies).<br />Last summer I was doing some spring cleaning (yeah I was late), when I came across the video (still in its shrinkwrap) and decided, what the heck, and put it on as background while I continued cleaning.  What I was not prepared for was the heartfelt performances, full of life and energy, and superbly on key and tempo.  Buckingham's performance especially made me stop and take notice.  I guess I had forgotten how talented he truly was.  Needless to say, I didn't stray from the TV, and \\"The Dance\\" wasn't used as background.  I sat down, turned it up, and enjoyed it thoroughly.<br />One could not only sense, but actually see the old tensions within the members of the group, and this actually added to the film, rather than detracting from it.  While Stevie Nicks' voice isn't as rich as it once was, she can still belt it out.  I found Mick Fleetwood's performance to be rather funny actually, but also powerful.  As far as Christie McVie, she still has that golden throat and is smooth as ever.<br />For those who were Fleetwood Mac fans, this should be on your priority list.  I even think the kids will sit up and take notice.  Between 1 and 10, \\"The Dance\\" gets a solid 8.  It's nice to have something lasting to remember, and I'm happy that I rediscovered this wonderful group.  Sadly, the days of the great bands seem all but over.
0790731452|3.0|Tim Burton's Mars Attacks spins wildly, and delightfully, out of control during its final forty minutes and it's one heck of a ride.  Sadly the build up is a tad dry and slow, being a bit too faithful to the plotless meanderings that served as &quot;character development&quot; in the disaster films of the seventies.  Nonetheless the sadistically goofballish Martians make this flawed movie worth repeated viewings.
1878424114|5.0|I've read all of Deepak Chopra's books.  From some I gained much, from some I gained little, but from this one I gained the most.  It's filled with 7 common-sense principles for attaining your goals and being happy.  All the principles presented are profound yet simple - some more practical than others.  All are concepts most of us already believe in but don't know exactly how to elucidate.  This book clears it up.  If you're going to buy just one Deepak Chopra book, let this be the one.
B00004RFFW|5.0|This film is the best of the series. The jokes are contagious and the laughter is non-stop. In the first film, we had to sit through Riggs and Murtaugh trying to become friends. In LW2, the story picks right up and doesen't quit until the movie's credits. This is an 80's cop movie at its best......
B000002NJS|5.0|Normally I'm not a huge Madonna fan but when I first heard the title track on the radio prior to the release of this album, I knew I had to buy it. I really like the direction Madonna went on this album. William Orbit is a good match for her. &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Skin&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot; are my all time favorite tracks. William Orbit's production is first class. As a huge techno fan I was skeptical of Madonna experimenting with electronic music but after hearing &quot;Ray of Light&quot; all doubts were put to rest. I still don't think that this album is 100% techno, just influenced by the genre. Nevertheless this album is awesome I think.
B00004YA66|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think of this movie on reading the synopsis, as movies which alter the realities of time as we know it are usually far-fetched and cumbersome. But this one really surprised me. Whether the premise is believeable is not even an issue here since the goals of the film are loftier. It's really about family, specifically the relationship that could have been between a father and son, and heavier theme of the consequences of our actions, even down to whether we take one hallway or another. It does make you think.<br />As for the entertainment value, the scene near the end of the movie where good and bad guys meet is very suspenseful, though it does stretch the imagination a bit (ooh, the hand!). The characters, specifically Dad as played by an always entertaining Dennis Quaid, are endearing and you want to see this family together. In the end, the film does not disappoint.  James Caviezel does justice to the adult son who drinks too much and could have used a bit of wisdom he never got from his Dad.<br />Other than a few loose ends that led to dangling questions after the movie, it was well done and highly recommended.
B00004Y635|5.0|I was really suprised when i saw Scream 3. I saw Scream 1, It's very good. I Saw Scream 2, It's not very good, i was disapointed after watching Scream 1. I Saw Scream 3, It's very good, i was really suprised, I didn't know who the killer was, i thought it was the old movie director. It really is a good movie and i think ill rent it again.
B00004X0Q0|1.0|If I have ever heard a more extreme perversion to one's ears I would be kicking myself off of a ladder and into a bar b q pit.  These punks don't represent Texas well, they are a disgrace.  We at El Paso were already on the map.  They're music is shallow, and they are major league sell outs.  What's next for cedric and company?  Gap ads, Calvin Klien models, thay have that waif look about them.  Spend you money on less cliche rock and buy something worth while.
B00000IAU3|4.0|I bought the CD for &quot;Here With Me.&quot;  However, the CD as a whole is wonderful.  Stylistically there's a bit of Sarah McLachlan, Beth Neilson Chapman, and perhaps just a touch of Sophie B. Hawkins in the music.  The lyrics are good throughout.  There are enough differences between each track not to be monotonous while still maintaining stylistic cohesion.  Short and simple:  It's a good CD.  If you like &quot;Here With Me&quot; there's a good chance you'll like the rest of the CD.
6305313687|5.0|This brutal, unflinching portrait of hatred in America should have earned Edward Norton an Academy Award.  When Norton's character is released from jail for murdering 3 black men (who were trying to steal his car) his view on life has drastically changed.  Before being convicted he was a respected skinhead who had earned legend status for his recruiting skills.  His younger brother (Edward Furlong) idolized him and awaits his release, not knowing of his brother's change of heart.<br />This film explores hatred in many of its forms with an unblinking eye.  Disturbing, haunting, and extremely eye opening this is one film that should be mandatory viewing in college sociology classes.  We've all encountered hatred and this film pleads with us to overcome it.  Powerful proof that hatred sows bitter fruit.
0688171664|5.0|I first read this book in 1975.  I particularly appreciated then the concrete illustrations used in the development of Pirsig's philosophy.  However, I was not prepared at that time to follow the details of the logic used to develop his main point, namely, that in ancient Greece rationality had unfairly toppled mysticism as a valid source of knowledge.<br />I always intended to read the book again and finally last month I found an open week, bought a copy of the new 25th anniversary edition, and went at it.  The text is unchanged in content but the print is larger and much easier to read than in my old paperback edition.  The margins are wider and allow more annotations.  It is well worth getting this Anniversary edition.<br />This time I got much deeper into Pirsig's main premise--the one noted above.  Pirsig believes Quality to be the missing element in today's culture, but he says it must be kept undefined so that rationality will not be able to kill it again as it did thousands of years ago.<br />My major satisfaction from this novel still comes from the unusually perceptive and cleverly-wrought metaphors that Pirsig presents to advance his philosophical arguments.  I have so many favorite ones it is difficult to choose among them.  For instance, he labels the University as &quot;Church of Reason,&quot; indicating it fanatical devotion to rationality at the expense of other values not approachable through rational means.  No wonder professors of philosophy feel threatened.  Rationality is their bread and butter!<br />Other illustrations:  He compares the experience of looking out of a framed car window with the frameless view you get riding a motorcycle and uses this as an example of breaking down the subject/object boundary.  He indicates that his objective is not to deal with &quot;the 'news,' the silt of tomorrow&quot; which accumulates when the river of culture bends, but to try to deepen the channels of &quot;the best&quot; that lies ahead along the river's future course.  He likes to follow &quot;an arrow that enlarges sideways in flight&quot; rather then tracking its forward path in order to find &quot;lateral truths&quot; that point to falseness of axioms which prevent hitting the target.  He points out that &quot;institutions such as schools, churches, government, and political organizations of every sort all tend to direct thought for ends other than truth, namely, for the perpetuation of their own functions.&quot;  I have often pondered this telling truth.<br />Ultimately, he finds Quality to be the uppermost element of the triad of truth--the creator of both subject and object, residing in the interface between the two.  His comparison of Quality with the ancient text of the Tao is exhilarating!<br />The Quality of this novel is extraordinary for me.  It exhibits many of the aspects of Quality in writing such as integrity, imagination, flux, continuity, suspense, insight, pathos, and allegory as it attempts to find the missing element in today's technology-dominated world.  It is one of the five formative books in my life, and has a place on my &quot;favorites&quot; bookshelf next to Walt Whitman's &quot;Leaves of Grass&quot; and the poems and essays of D.H. Lawrence.'s future course.

6304602901|5.0|This movie is a must see for those who enjoy comedy. Anyone who gives this movie a bad review must lead a very serious and boring life. I recomend this movie to anyone who enjoys laughter therapy and living life to its fullest.
0517122707|5.0|I first read this book over 15 years ago, and it hasn't loss its freshness. It is not only funny (like others, my sides hurt from laughing), it is poignant and meaningful. The only other novel that I can compare it to is Heller's &quot;Catch 22&quot;. <br />Those who don't appreciate satire should avoid this one. However, if you can laugh at yourself and the world around you, invest in this book. You'll come back to it time and again.
B00004THDI|5.0|I absolutly love the film and the soundtrack. It is a must have item!
B000001FMX|5.0|ALMOST 30 YEARS AFTER IT'S RELEASE,THIS ALBUM STILL SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THE BALLSIEST ROCK IN HISTORY. FILLED WITH FORMATIVE PUNK CLASSICS,LIKE &quot;PERSONALITY CRISIS&quot;, &quot;LOOKING FOR A KISS&quot; &amp; &quot;TRASH&quot;, PRECIOUS LIITLE ROCKED HARDER THAN THIS ALBUM WHEN IT WAS RELEASED IN 1973. JOHHNY THUNDERS' WHITE NOISE GUITAR AND JERRY NOLAN'S ROCK SOLID DRUMMING ARE WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION ALONE. PROPHETS WITHOUT HONOR IN THEIR OWN TIME,THEY ARE NOW CONSIDERED LEGENDARY &amp; AN INFLUENCE ON A WHO'S WHO OF PUNK. TRULY EXCELLENT STUFF.
6300263673|4.0|This movie works for me.  Yes there is some immature dialogue here and there and all turns out right in the end for the characters played by Swayze and Grey.  However, it shows how love and affection can conquer all angles.  It also shows the strengths and weakensses in both Swayze and Grey and Jerry Orbach for that matter.  The Dance scenes are pretty captivating for the particular genre.  Maybe not the most well developed story in the world but for a night when something relatively light will do, this flick will certainly fit the bill.
B000002U8A|5.0|Seven and the Ragged Tiger has the most depth of any Duran Duran album. If you like the bubblegum sound of Rio, you may not like this one as well; if you appreciate real music, this will be your favorite.
B000002AS3|5.0|remember what it was like when it all just began??  if you wasnt in england when this album came out you probably will never understand what this band really meant and really did.now they seem to be dead and gone its time this album saw the light of day again.its funny how things seem different the morning after isnt it???  lets not forget.
6300216209|5.0|I have seen it countless times since if first came out in 1970 and was so thrilled to finally get my personal video of it this Christmas.<br />If you love a love story, this is the penultimate one.  Oliver, the Harvard jock,and Jennifer, the poor and smart-mouthed music student from Rhode Island, touch the deepest parts of our hearts.  Theirs is the love story that we all want---two people completely dedicated to each other. They survive class differences and parental disapproval because they love each other.  How wonderful to see the heart-warming snowball scenes when their love is so obvious to viewers.<br />Of course, it is in the end, a tear-jerker that requires unlimited tissues.  The couple that has it all can not overcome the one thing that is out of their hands.<br />You'll laugh and cry and be touched for a lifetime.  This is the greatest movie.  Don't miss it.
6303921248|5.0|This is one of the best Jane Austen movies ever! I quote it all the time, and all my friends do too. We positively roll over with laughter at the facial expressions of Mrs.Bennett, or at the clumsiness of Mr.Collins. Jennifer Ehle is suberb, she makes you believe she is Lizzie, every emotion, every look is Lizzie Bennett all the way. Colin Firth is also incredibly good, every facial movement and tone is Mr.Darcy. I think everyone should watch this at least once in a lifetime. For it is a once in a lifetime movie.
B0000542D2|5.0|When I was in high school my mom bought a record by this new group The Beatles.  I wasn't impressed, give me my 409 and Shutdown.  But when A Hard Days Night came out I saw it, not that many rock movies except Elvis back then.  After 2 or so times through I left the theater, jwalked accross the street to the music store, bought the sheet music and retired to my guitar. I was hooked!  Now ask me who's that little old man and I'll ask back What little old man.  I think I have the whole thing memorized.  I bought the videotape, my wife gave me the computer CD ( There are some interesting cut scenes), and later she bought me the DVD. I quess I didn't know all the script after all, The DVD version adds the clarity to really follow a great movie. The acting, these aren't actors, but you have to remind yourself of that.  Compare it to say the Monkees, argh. The Writing/Directing, an English friend turned me on to the Goon Show and I thought of the movie, then discovered the Goon Show-Lester-Beatle connection and saw where the great scripting and scenes came from. A must see if you were there or want to know what it was like then.
B00003CX8J|1.0|My chipped Panasonic RV60 player wouldn't read this disc. If you have a region 2 version of this player chipped for region 1, you may have to wait until Fox deign to release the region 2 version. Bet it won't have all the extras, though.
B00004YA66|5.0|This film is one of the best I've seen.  The sequence of events keeps you hopping (don't blink...you might miss something!).  The fire fighting scenes are excellent.  Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezal give great performances.  The story...what can you say about the story...awsome.  As one reviewer puts it:  Father and Son talk across time and alter their lives...cool.
0811826848|5.0|This extraordinary project has been made possible because Paul McCartney,George Harrison and Ringo Starr have agreed to tell  their combined story especially for this book. Together with John wife Yoko Ono Lennon, they have also made available the full transcript (including all the outtakes) of the television and video series The Beatles Anthology. Through painstaking compilation of sources worldwide, John Lennon's words are equally represented in this remarkable volume. Furthermore, The Beatles have opened their personal and management archives specifically for this project, allowing the unprecedented release of photographs which they took along their ride to fame, as well as fascinating documents and memorabilia from their homes and offices.<br />What a book I can tell you The Beatles Anthology is! Each page is brimming with personal stories and rare and vintage images. Snaphots from their family collection takes us look back to the days when John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey were just boys growing up in Liverpool. They talk in turn about those early years and how they came to join the band that would make them known around the world as John, Paul, George and Ringo. Then, weaving back and forth, they tell the astonishing story of life as The Beatles: the first gigs the phenomenon of their rise to fame, the musical a social change of their heyday, all the way through to their breakup. From the time Ringo tried to take his drum kit home on the bus to their eagerly anticipated meeting with Elvis, from the makeing of the Sgt Pepper album to their last photo session together at John's house, The Beatles Anthology is a once-in-a-lifetime collection of The Beatles' own memories.<br />Created with their full cooperation, The Beatles Anthology is, in effect, The Beatles autobiography. Like the music, which has been a part of so many of our lives, it's warm, frank, funny, poignant and bold. At last for the first time in Print, is the history of The Beatles-By The Beatles in their own story.
B00003CXE6|4.0|There's a series of scenes about halfway through \\"Gladiator\\", when you realize the filmmakers have pulled off a neat trick.  Commodus has reinstated the gladiatorial matches at the Colosseum.  Proximo, a slave-owner gives this advice to Maximus, a gladiator intended for the ring of battle: \\"I was the best because the crowd loved me; win the crowd and you will win your freedom.\\"  He's talking of the power of spectacle, as a means to an end (i.e., Maximus' freedom).  It is easy to see how this applied to not only the Gladiators of ancient Rome, but its politicians as well; Commodus is desperate for the love of the people (a.k.a. the vulgar mob) and the spectacle of combat shall bring that to him.  Taking this strain of logic further, it most definitely applies to politics in contemporary society.  Witness the \\"style-over-substance\\" approach of modern political campaigning.  But nowhere does spectacle reign supreme more than... Hollywood blockbuster movies!  Of which \\"Gladiator\\" is most definitely one.  Neat trick, no?  Kind of a gutsy move, biting the hand that feeds and feeds and feeds you.<br />So how do we judge this movie as spectacle?  Pretty good, I'd say.  From the opening bloodbath in Germania (\\"Unleash Hell,\\" Maximus says, coolly), to the multiple battles in the Colosseum, director Ridley Scott handles the action with great style.  The sheer size of these battles is impressive enough, and the action does its very best to measure up.  If you are a fan of watching appendages sliced from bodies, or ever wondered what sound a sword would make when plunged into the torso of a Roman, then you won't be disappointed.  And except for a dubious decision by one of the characters that sets up the film's climax, the story was handled well.  Sure, it aims for Shakespearean and misses.  But what summer blockbuster even gets this close to the Bard?  It's a poor man's mixture of `Julius Caesar', `Antony and Cleopatra', and even `Hamlet'. <br />Ridley Scott seems to have takena cue from Jerry Bruckheimer (who's produced five movies directed by brother Tony), by casting a boatload of quality actors to read from a script who's main function is to quickly deliver the audience to another action sequence.  All of the actors make the best of what they're given.  Joaquin Phoneix as Emperor Commodus is suitably creepy, whether he's visibly lusting after his father's power or his sister's body.  Richard Harris as said father is majestic as the dying Marcus Aurelius.  Connie Nielsen as said sister is cunning and thoughtful as the daughter who, if she'd have been born a son, would have made a fine leader.  Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, and even Derek Jacobi show up in small, but pivotal roles, lending authority to the proceedings.<br />But there would be no spectacle, no \\"Gladiator\\", with out Russell Crowe.  I am ever amazed at the amount of visceral intensity this man burns on screen.  I tried to picture someone else in this role, but couldn't.  Who has his combination of physical power and grace, charisma, and quiet dignity?  I wouldn't have been surprised if the filmmakers had mounted the Colosseum itself on his sturdy shoulders, in one last fit of Apollo-like spectacle.  It would definitely be a fitting end to a fine piece of entertainment such as this.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|When i put the movie in the player and hit play... i was completly surprised to see an action scene right in the beginning. But wow. The story line was very easy to follow, and i found many of the details, though perhaps not of the mission (to steal a German code machine), But of the designs of the subs, inside and outside. It really had be riveted to the chair i was in, and gave me a scary view of the cramped, leakey interior of a WWII U-Boat. The best scene in the movie was when the american crew of the U-Boat... oops, cant tell that until yove seen the movie, sorry!

I WAS WRONG... SHE IS NOT THE STRONGEST VOCALIST I HAVE EVER HEARD, BUT THE WOMAN DOES HAVE MUSICALITY. <br />WITH HOT DANCE NUMBERS AND SOME GREAT BALLADS, JENNIFER HAS ESTABLISHED THE FACT THAT SHE CAN SING! &quot;WAITING FOR TONIGHT&quot; IS MY PERSONAL FAVE. IT IS TRULY ONE OF THE BEST DANCE NUMBERS OF THE LAST 2 YEARS. <br />LIKE I SAID BEFORE: NOT THE BEST VOICE THE WORLD. BUT, SHE IS A SINGER THAT I ENJOY LISTENING TO.
B000002LBH|5.0|I can't even begin to explain to you how much I LOVE The Smiths.  Louder Than Bombs has been a life-changer and a life-saver for me.  The songs are so unfathomably BEAUTIFUL and BRILLIANT, yet so incredibly accessible.  You don't have to be a rock snob to find yourself singing along.  And Louder Than Bombs is probably to best of The Smiths' work for a listener to begin with, because it contains such a wide variety of their songs and gives you the most for your money (24 tracks!).  It was my first Smiths CD, and I am so eternally glad that I got it.  You MUST own this.
B00004X01U|1.0|Madonna's earliest records were marked by tremendous production values, and  having Nile Rodgers produce was a brilliant idea on somebodies part.  However, this record is  very weak.  It is overly repetitive, and she doesn't have the energy she  used to have.  I think she is tired.  Madonna as a cowboy  figure is a bizarre twist, and it doesn't fit.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I'm not kidding.<br />Nor was I surprised to see it given only a 4-star average. I've read over most of the reviews of this film, and the vast majority of them can be divided into two seperate categories: those who loved the film, and those who believed they didn't understand the film. I don't think a concept like &quot;getting it&quot; applies to Magnolia -- each person takes away something different from the film. <br />I think a lot of people were expecting the usual pseudo-philosophical tripe that comes out of Hollywood, and were confused and dismayed to get something geniunely philosophical and geniunely heartfelt.<br />Combined with outstanding acting -- particularly from Tom Cruise and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, snappy dialogue and wonderful directing, Magnolia is a film that speaks to your heart. You need only listen. ~DH
B00004U30D|1.0|I suspect the reason this film is so awful is due to studio politics and the compromises that have to be made to get projects off the ground in an increasingly prohibitively expensive medium. Certainly the director Sam Mendes had to abandon his first attempt, probably because the script is such piffle it's hard to make it work. He gave it his best shot, fair enough. This isn't the truth about America, it's one script writer's view of America and judging by his CV he has not done a great deal other than work in sitcom, which says a lot about the structure, approach and choices made in this film. Trite scenes such as the throwing of the plate (queue canned laughter) and Benning's unconvincing behaviour in selling a house for instance. Nothing works or convinces, especially the fatuous notion that a father should be murdered for 'ignoring' his sibling. I suspect the writer threw in other stuff garnered from 'Sex, Lies And Video Tape' and a tasteless who-dunnit element in an attempt to make the picture seem familiar and entertaining for the audience. The bottom line was always money, not profundity.<br />I think I'm right in saying Geffin had a hand in backing this film and there has been talk recently of a 'gay clique' in Hollywood and it's influence behind the film'making scenes. I don't know if that's the case here but the gay couple are signalled straight away as being the happiest. The film also plugs the usual gay propaganda that anyone who dislikes gays must automatically be in the closet. The scene where such an alleged person punches his son full in the chest for touching a plate is particularly unconvincing and pernicious. The portrayal of the wife and women in general all seems to come from a certain questionable perspective.<br />The so-called spiritual element about the nature of beauty produces an unbelievably laughable scene involving a bag. One character looks at the blood matter of a brain with a hippy dippy stare that seems to say &quot;Wow man, It's so bea-u-ti-ful!&quot; I cannot believe anyone takes these preposterous contrivances with dead birds and the like seriously. It's palpable nonsense.<br />All this huffing and puffing just for a reactionary 'Wizard Of Oz' homily about a family picture and 'there's no place like home.' The film then proceeds with some sentimental voice-over guff about leaves and the loss of youth. As the camera pulls back over suburbia and the patronising final sentiments are spoken, we can almost hear the film-makers behind the screen giggling &quot;My God, are they really BUYING all of this?&quot; Well, sadly the majority of people are sheep.<br />The reality is that America has oppressed a large number of weaker and poorer countries over the last three decades in the guise of fighting Communism. Very few people seem to be aware of the real horror that has gone on in central America and America's hand in it, and the third world in general, at the expense and loss of life of the poorest in those societies. America is not the evil of the world but in the light of this enormous suffering and loss of an experience that only comes once to us all, are we really expected to care about the 'suffering' of Burnham and his wife and their arguments about damaging the sofa? Americans love this film because very few of them have suffered real injustice in their lives, the kind you suffer if you're born in Sudan, for instance. A price has been paid for such comforts and Americans should be grateful for the lives they have, and not whinge. Materialism does not necessarily mean a loss of inner worth or that you can deepen your world. Many have been freed to pursue personal expression, such as making drivel like this film. Be grateful for what you have in the time we have left, which in the face of increasing weapon super-technology attainment, may not be long.<br />American Beauty's sincerity is disingenuous. It flatters to deceive. It's purpose is to make Americans feel safe and good about themselves so that the people behind it will be successful and make money. There is a machine that has to be fed and a huge amount of talentless people are out there figuring increasingly desperate ways to do so. 'American Beauty' incapsulates all that is glib, meretricious and plain wrong about modern cinema and as such, in my opinion, it is one of the very worst films ever made.s so that the people behind it will be successful and make money.

B000051VWW|4.0|This album deserves 5 stars but I gave it four because more songs should have been added(I think). Sade is a very pretty women Physicaly and spirtially. This album shows her best. This is my first time being any of her albums but I have heard many of them. I am a 20 year old college student and I am not affraid to but this Lover's Rock CD.
B000001E18|5.0|I know I know... I'm late to review this CD. It's been out for quite a long time. But I think after listening to Zooropa again, my likes for it haven't died.<br />The best song has to be &quot;Lemon&quot; for its humorous video &amp; &quot;tangy&quot; lyrics. Another great track &quot;The wanderer&quot; is haunting with Johnny Cash's vocals. This track finishes off Zooropa in the way I would. Zooropa is a jumble of ideas put into action, in a way I would call a fantastic B-side Cd. Bono &amp; the boys experimentation has created a classic CD.<br />&quot;Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car&quot; is another one of those great rock songs, with brilliant, tantalizing lyrics. So is the song &quot;Some days&quot;. &quot;Babyface&quot; comes to us soft at first with that drifting electric guitar and drums, the toy piano balances the sexy part of this tune.<br />The title track sounds like the closest sound we're accustomed to hear from them. It has all the sounds from the 80's. I don't care that the CD was made &amp; released in 93. It's great. And I bought it the day it was released. I'm kind of glad I waited so long to review this CD. One reason is because I read many reviews before doing my own review, allowing me to decide whether or not it was worth it. Secondly, I noticed there were a few reviews done in the past few weeks. This made me decide to take a chance.<br />One thing I don't get is the Bleep bleep bleep... sound at the end of the CD, after 1 minute of the end of &quot;The wanderer&quot;.<br />I hope you like the review. The Cd is excellent.
B00004XONN|3.0|i have to agree with the &quot;non-professional&quot; critics - the only thing thing that makes this cd is the fact that it's RADIOHEAD. in the last thirty years others have taken me on the experimental trips to other musical worlds similar to this. Bach, Alan Parson's Project, Third-Stone-from-the-Sun Jimi, Vangelis, Todd Rundgren, and others that left me and never came back. i'm sorry, but the professional critics have overrated this, i guess simply because they want to support RADIOHEAD's experiments. and that's ok. i've listened enough times to appreciate the trip out of my ordinary musical world, but it doesn't leave me wanting more, just curious where the experiment will go next.
B00004STPT|5.0|In response to a previous reviewer who has dismissed this soundtrack as forgettable, it happens to be very much the opposite and is irreplaceable. Hans Zimmer should not be coined or dismissed as a commercialistic &quot;New Age&quot; musical .... artist who composes Hollywood soundtracks. His sheer genious and talent along with Lisa Gerrard's is of a unique and different nature and conviction not conformed to typical &quot;Hollywood&quot; standards. Zimmer's score does not succumb to the stereotypical Hollywood epic score formula.It is anything but contrived or formulaic.In specific scenes where some sort of uplifting backdrop music would normally be used by any other composer that should indicate the main character's/hero's presence in a scene, he (Zimmer)goes the opposite direction. The music is befitting of the various moods and events in the film rather than being assigned in segments as themes for each character's screen presence! In other words, there are no tracks or individual character themes (&quot;Maximus' Theme&quot;, &quot;Commodus'Theme&quot;, or worse yet, &quot;Maximus'&amp; Lucilla's&quot; Love Theme).Give Mr. Zimmer a break and realize the man knows what he is definitley doing...and doing it RIGHT ! Believe me, this soundtrack has stayed in my mind days after listening to it for the first time. Any writer or composer capable of doing that has accomplished his goal successfully !...However, playing the devil's advocate here, I do wonder what if another composer or writer such as Greek artist Vangelis would have accomplished as well had Zimmer not been chosen...Hmmm ?
6304994540|5.0|Best film of the 90's.  Period.
6305922756|5.0|This good movie is made even better in its DVD format. Something nags me though. Are Nigel Tufnel of Spinal Tap and Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden related or are they the same people? Am I alone when I say they look so much alike?
0399146253|2.0|I found this recent work by Patricia Cornwell tedious reading.  I am found of her chief character Dr. Kay Scarpetta, but either  Ms. Cornwell is losing her touch or I'm reading too much.
B000001F3C|5.0|Obviously each and every song by U2 has deep meaning behind it (a rarity these days).  But whether you're interested in that or not, the songs are incredible.  Two of my favorite songs of all time come from this album.  &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;New Year's Day&quot; have got to be two of U2's greatest works.  For their meaning, and their sound.
0525945636|5.0|This was one of the fastest reads I've ever had!  I couldn't help myself, I really couldn't put it down!  The suspense is skillfully done in this tale.  It reminded me of the &quot;Eye Of The Needle&quot; - I found myself wondering if things I knew happened were going to happen in the book!  If you enjoy Follett's work, all of his work, then you will enjoy this book.  It's not as complex as &quot;Dangerous Fortune&quot; or &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; but it definitely grabs you and pulls you in immediately.
0446677450|1.0|This book is the perfect example of one that should have been an article.  An editing fiasco.  There are interesting ideas presented, but the personal anecdotes take up the majority of the space and have truly no pedagogical value.  Most are barely coherent and hardly interesting.  Plus, for all his statements on how important it is to develop financial intelligence, he does a poor job explaining how to do it, and provides no fundamental knowledge for the reading of valuable texts like, for example, the Wall Street Journal.  Save yourself the money--borrow it from the library, or skip it altogether.
B00004YYDI|3.0|If you're a Jean Reno fan, you'll love this.   The movie has everything you want, until about 30 minutes in, when his character considers shooting Natalie Portman's Matilde.   Prior to that point, it's great (particularly when Reno's character goes to the movies).  Afterwards, it's hokey and unbelievable.   Also, and maybe this is a &quot;cultural thing&quot;, but Besson clearly believes that the prepubescent (at this time) Portman is sexually interesting.  Aiello, Portman, and Oldman all do very well, and of course Reno never makes a false move, so what's wrong here?    Either the screenplay or the director, I think.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This CD is absolutely wonderful.  Christina blends her teen pop popularity with more soulful and jazzy tunes.  It's definitely a more mature sound for Christina.  If you like Christmas music from the heart and soul (which is where it should come from), you'll love this.
B00001QEG5|5.0|This is one of Twisted Sister's best efforts.  Trademark raw power with some of their best hooks.  Dee Snider's masterful high energy lyrics.  It would have been triple platinum if it had come out five years earlier, but times were a changin'.
0688170528|2.0|I was introduced to this book by a good friend who raved about it and convinced me to read it myself.  So I guess when I got it I was expecting this great novel, but half way through it, I couldn't read any more.  Picoult doesn't portray teenage lives very realistically.  She describes Emily's sink towards depression, but she doesn't develop why this occurs.  She presents Emily's thoughts well, but gives no back-up for them.  You don't feel like you &quot;know&quot; Emily because the author doesn't go deep into her charachter development.  I feel that the story moved fast, but the plot didn't move at all.  Years went by, and there was little or no advancement in the plot.  The book wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
6301966562|5.0|As a kid who spent most of his formative years in the 80's, this movie is to me a real marker of the decade.  It is a fairy-tale type story, and a great love story.  The main character, a computer named Edgar, does things that computers these days can't even do, but reality is not the selling point for this film.  Every minute of it is an absolute joy to watch.  Unfortunately, Lenny Von Dohlen's career pretty much ended at this point...except for Home Alone 3 (yeah, ended was the right word).  The setting is perfect, the characters are perfect, and Bud Cort as Edgar is very funny.  You'll find yourself investing emotions in this movie, and not worrying about the fact that you have to throw reality out the window.  Don't be suprised if after you watch it, you immediately go to the store for the soundtrack!
1878424114|4.0|This book is based on a very simple idea, one which seems almost like a Copernican inversion.  That is, the Universe is intellegent enough to keep a billion trillion stars or more spinning in heavens and a billion trillion cells in every organism on this planet in working harmony.  Therefore, its probably intellegent enough to solve your problems.  Chopra explains the process of becoming sensitive to this greater intellegence, and allowing it to work through you.  He uses seven laws, though these laws seem to be more conventions for division that actual principles.  In truth, they really all blend together.  The interrelatedness of the different sections leads to a repetitive feeling that can give the impression that you've read a passage before,which may cause you to skip the paragraph and thus miss a new point that has been made.  This is only the real drawback to the book.  Otherwise, I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this book to anyone interested in finding deeper solutions to their worries.
B00003CX8J|4.0|The reason I went to see this movie is that I'm a huge fan of both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKlellan.  I know very little about the X-Men except what I've heard and so I walked into this movie with very little expectation.  I was mildly surprised with the storyline, in the fact that there was one.  I was very pleased with the acting and the characters themselves.  The script was weak, with Storm's best line coming in as &quot;Do you know what happens to frogs when they get struck by lightning?  The same thing as everything else.&quot;  OOoo..striking.  The villains were interesting and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in total blue is enough to set any young boy aflame.  Not the greatest movie, but better than most of the other comic book movies out there.
B00000IAU3|1.0|i don't know what the other reviewers hear in this &quot;let's copy sinead, fionna, and portishead&quot; artist.  there's no originality.  sinead was a breakthrough.  fionna was piercing. but this artist did not strike me as anyone original or had anything original to share!  save your money, cuz it ain't worth it.
B00003CX5A|5.0|The tale of Ichabod Crane comes to life as never before, in this richly textured and detailed offering of the timeless legend, \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" directed by Tim Burton.  In this dark and vividly imaginative, definitive version, Johnny Depp plays Crane, a New York City Police Constable at the end of the Eighteenth Century, who is dispatched northward by his superiors to the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate the grisly murders of three of it's citizens.  Crane has been chosen, not because he is considered a man of vision for employing the latest scientific techniques in his investigations, but rather because his methods are looked upon askance by his colleagues, and they welcome the chance to be rid of him.  He is, they feel, something of an embarrassment to their community, and therefore better relegated to a small, out-of-the-way township of diminutive significance, whereupon his arrival he learns that the murders all share a common thread:  In each case, the head has been severed from the body, and carried off.  And so, equipped with the latest and most sophisticated wherewithal science has to offer (many instruments of which are of his own design), Constable Crane begins his investigation.  Working from a terrific screenplay by Kevin Yagher (adapted from the story by Washington Irving), Burton makes use of magnificent sets and the talents of an exemplary cast to bring his tale to life.  He creates an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding that permeates the drama and captures that same sense of menace and disquietude evoked by the classic horror films of the `30's and `40's, such as \\"Frankenstein,\\" \\"Dracula,\\" \\"The Wolf Man,\\" and the like, and infuses it with some rather graphic, yet stylishly presented and realistic decapitations and various other bloodlettings, all enhanced and delivered with cutting-edge special F/X.  All of which, for the fan of true gothic horror, becomes a bona fide cauldron of unspeakable delights.  It must be noted that none of this ispresented in a fashion anywhere near to what could be considered a \\"gore-fest\\" by any stretch of the imagination; Burton maintains the gothic aspects of the story, visually and dramatically, and renders it all with a touch of real class.  Never does he sink to casting about for a gross visual, or attempt to manipulate a situation for the sake of some cheap thrills.  It's a matter of integrity-- artistic and otherwise-- and Burton has it; it also demonstrates that he has a respect for his audience, for which he is to be commended, as he works in an industry in which that attitude of consideration does not necessarily prevail.  Depp gives an exceptional performance as Crane, affecting a style reminiscent of Colin Clive in the original \\"Frankenstein,\\" or Basil Rathbone in \\"Son Of Frankenstein,\\" which fits so nicely with all that Burton is attempting (successfully) to do with this film.  It signals that rare rapport between actor and director wherein a concurrent vision is realized, for all of these attributes of the classical actor that Depp brings to the character are exactly what Burton needed from his star to make the film work so well; the aspect it lends to the final product evinces the same difference as that between a fiddle and a Stradivarius.  In a similar vein, in a supporting role, Michael Gambon gives a performance as Baltus Van Tassel that is akin to that of Depp's in adding to the overall ambience of the film, as does Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Samuel Philipse.  The leading ladies also answer Burton's exacting call, especially Christina Ricci as Katrina Anne Van Tassel, and Miranda Richardson, who casts a spell as Lady Van Tassel.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Lisa Marie (Lady Crane), Casper Van Dien (Brom Van Brunt), Jeffrey Jones (Reverend Steenwyck), Ian McDiarmid (Dr. Lancaster), Michael Gough (Notary Hardenbrook), Mark Pickering (Young Masbath) and, especially menacing in a pivotal role, Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman.  As hedid before with such films as \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" and \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" Tim Burton, with \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" has given us yet another entertaining and exciting film that veritably carves out a singular niche for itself in the genre of the unique.  It's a quality film that deserves a special place in every DVD or video collection.  Truly one to be appreciated and savored.
B000002H2Z|4.0|Giving up the self-imposed exile from which &quot;The Top&quot; emerged and deciding to break through to mainstream pop audiences and daytime radio airplay, Robert Smith ended up creating the band's overall most varied and experimental album. There's a seemingly conscious effort by both the band and the production not to allow this release to be pigeonhold, be it through surprisingly groovy dance songs like &quot;Close to me&quot; or by playing around with styles that no one would have expected from Robert a few years earlier. A significant step forward in the band's rapid sonic evolution during the mid-'80s is the initially promising opener, &quot;Inbetween days&quot;. Very similar to New Order's more organic songs like &quot;Age of consent&quot; or &quot;Regret&quot;, this song is as catchy as pop music can be - a strong, rumbling rhythm combined with fast-paced acoustic guitars, simple keyboard melodies, and certainly this Hooky style of bass playing. Such tracks are very spontaneous and have an unpolished edge, almost sounding like they were recorded live instead of being put together in the studio. Robert himself said, &quot;Eight songs (out of ten) are first takes, which is something we haven't done since we made 'Seventeen seconds'&quot;. It makes perfect sense, since he wanted to abandon productions like &quot;Pornography&quot; where he used to work in the studio for more than 20 hours a day to ensure total control over the project. &quot;Kyoto song&quot; and the ponderous &quot;Six different ways&quot; are the closest to throwaways, but the strong flamenco flavor of &quot;The blood&quot; redeems everything, complete with tasteful musicianship and appropriate vocal performance. &quot;Push&quot;, actually the album's centerpiece, demonstrates both the pop-oriented side and the darker undercurrents of &quot;The head&quot; in full effect, as the band delivers arena-rock with lyrics about physical and emotional desolation. &quot;The baby screams&quot; and &quot;A night..&quot; (with saxophone solo) also follow the theme of the aforementioned song and manage to be both rocking and atmospheric. &quot;Close to me&quot; is easily one of the most quirky dance songs of the '80s, mixing shuffling drum beats with a funky bass line, mimicked toy piano, and minimal organ backing. Perhaps it provided a blueprint for some of the Aphex Twin's recent efforts. The drilling, abrasive bass line of &quot;Screw&quot; is another fairly strange element of this album, but the Cure do not completely turn their back on the sound of previous efforts: &quot;Sinking&quot; brings the album to a fine conclusion with its thick layers of synthesizers and ominous bass throb. Overall, &quot;The head&quot; appears as a transitional work, neither eschewing the trademark approach of the band nor quintessentially Cure-sounding like the band's early-'80s work. Like the subsequent &quot;Kiss me..&quot;, it forced critics to question their penchant for labelling the Cure as goth-rock, but provided no easy answers. Those who like their '80s independent rock spiced with variety and eccentricity will certainly enjoy this work; personally, &quot;The head&quot; is not among my favorite Cure albums. Its mood doesn't go as deep as that of, say, &quot;Disintegration&quot;, and the whole affair is a little disjointed and uncohesive.

006016848X|4.0|Wives may not get too much from Grey's book, since they all seem to know everything already. \\"That's just common sense,\\" I think is what mine said after reading it. But for us men, this is useful. Now we can understand why our wives, with two minutes left in the big game, decide now is a good time to discuss the drapes.<br />Just having fun. The book is really very helpful. Using plenty of humorous anecdotes, Grey illustrates through example how conflicts arise, and how by making simple tactical and verbal changes, they can be avoided or resolved. Men Are From Mars helps explain to husbands that women talk not necessarily to reach a destination, but as a process of expression and emoting. I call it thinking with your mouth. He points out that men don't need to like it or comprehend it, just know that it's normal. She's not insane. The biggest bonus in the book is the tip on how to respond. Wives think that because we're not talking with them and don't even appear to be listening, we're either ignoring them or dead from the neck up. Which is largely true. But apparently all we have to do is occasionally nod our head, make brief eye contact, and say \\"uh huh\\" at appropriate times. I'm not sure that's going to help during the hurry-up offense, but it's a start.<br />He offers other helpful tips, like agreeing to discuss stuff only during TV commercials, when the man can mute the volume and focus his attention on his wife for a full three minutes. This works well, except with ESPN SportsCenter, since their commercials are usually pretty good.<br />The book is not beautifully written and tends to be redundant, but I think Grey does this intentionally to sink the message home to the denser male mind, almost a hypnotic or brainwashing effect. My wife and I had a lot of fun reading the book, and now use the examples to regularly tease each other. Hey, without humor, marriage can be a real drag.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Green Day is by far my favorite band in the world. This album is a fine example of their growth and maturity in their music making. The lyrics are thoughtful and possses a sense of wisdom. My favorite songs are Minority, Misery, Fashion Victim, Castaway, and Hold On. This album is not as good as Nimrod or Dookie, but is still a great album, and a must for any Green Day fan. If you liked Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod, you might not like this album as much, but it grows on you. Buy it.

Maybe one or two songs were okay, but if your looking for some true rock, go to white zombie or something like that.  If you want rap, go to eminem or wu-tang clan.  Just please don't buy this.  If you really want it, borrow it from a freind first.  You'll be returning it the first chance you get.

0316777722|5.0|Because you laugh so hard at practically every other sentence. This was my first taste of the wonderfully insightful and incontinence-inducing David Sedaris. After reading Holidays on Ice and Naked, I'm still a fan of his latest. I picked up this book from a pile of crap from Costco that my mom had bought and scanned the book jacket blurb. Referring to Sedaris as a &quot;spooky man child&quot; was what hooked me. This became my favorite book because I could read it 100 times and the humor would still be fresh and hysterical. I fell in love with David Sedaris while I read it and would often flip to the back cover to smile at his cute little face.    READ THIS BOOK.
6304383827|4.0|&quot;Emma&quot; starring Gwyneth Paltrow is a wonderful tale of friendship and what happens when the line is crossed.  Emma Woodhouse is a whitty, clever and somewhat manipulative girl who finds the art of matchmaking exciting.  Emma finds her matchmaking skills successful when her nanny, Miss Taylor marries Mr. Weston.  Due to the successfulness of Miss Taylor and Mr. Weston's marriage, Emma tries to setup her friend Harriet Smith with Mr. Elton, a somewhat annoying character who turns out to adore Emma rather than Harriet Smith. Emma now doubts herself as a matchmaker and decides to give up the practice altogether.  <br />Mr. Knightly is a man who is the only person to find fault in Emma and her actions.  He is very honest and direct with her, and it is his opinion that matters the most to Emma.  Emma at times finds his opinions to be rather harsh, but realizes after awhile that they are true.  For instance, during a picnic Emma says an inappropriate comment to Mrs. Bates, the local busybody.  Mrs. Bates is stunned and embarrassed by the comment and finds herself on the verge of tears.  Emma seems to think that no harm was caused and that Mrs. Bates deserved to be put in her place.  Mr. Knightly runs after Emma and explains to her that he is repulsed and likewise embarrassed by her actions.  Emma does take his words to heart and sobs uncontrollably.<br />I love the way this movie incorporates the various characters and presents them in an organized fashion.  I found myself identifying with many characters, in particular Harriet Smith, because I have been setup with people who have not exactly &quot;worked out.&quot;  Gwyneth Paltrow plays a very believeable character of Emma.  She incorporates the innocence and yet is able to manipulate most anyone to do what she thinks is best for them.  For example, Harriet Smith receives a marriage proposal from Mr. Martin, a man she is quite fond of.  Rather than be happy for her, Emma immediately tells Harriet to forget about his proposal and continue to pursue Mr. Elton.  In the end, Mr. Elton marries a very selfish woman and Emma, for awhile, loses her friendship with Harriet.  Harriet eventually forgives Emma for the trouble she has caused and congratulates Emma on her engagement to Mr. Knightly.  <br />I find this movie to be lighthearted and a movie in which, the events are presented without much thinking from the audience.  In other words, it was a very well versed movie that really left some things to the imagination.  The fact that it is a romance/comedy is appealing to me, so of course, I took particular interest in this movie.  I did feel though, that in some places the movie did somewhat drag and I felt that the character of Mr. Frank Churchill was a little weak.  Overall, I was very pleased with this movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in a well-developed romance/comedy movie.
B00004XONN|4.0|This cd is absolutly amazing! It is not your regular Rock record. You can tell by this seris of songs that Radiohead is the hardest working band in the world right now. They are in no way lazy, and on the top of there game. I can't wait for &quot;Amnesiac&quot; it is coing out in June!!
B00003CXDG|1.0|All right well first off I absolutely hated this movie because the whole story was completely unrealistic. In particular, when Ethan Hunt and another guy are riding motorcycles at 80 mph and then jump and hit each other and then get up without a broken bone or anything.  The next one is where he is scaling the rock ledge without any ropes.  Some people probably think he is a real cool action hero sort of guy, when actually he is a complete idiot for first off climbing without ropes and second climbing up a wall of sandstone, which is one of the weakest and most likey to break sort of rocks.  Overall there are plenty more unrealistic stunts in this movie which are supposed to come out has action packed but really are stupid and unrealistic.
B00004Y2QT|4.0|I used to be a fairly hard-core Prince fan (yes, FAN, not FRIEND).  Over the last ten years, I gradually lost a lot of faith in him as an artist.  As someone who has listened closely to his output during the '90s, I feel he has become extremely erratic.  Who knows what he'll do next-- I believe he has it in him to produce some of his best work.  But if he follows the pattern established in the '90s, this new decade may prove to be very dissapointing...<br />All that said, you can hardly go wrong with Prince performing live in concert.  The man is a dynamo on-stage.  This DVD is one of the most entertaining things he's released in years.  It's almost two hours long with many highlights:  I like the two numbers he does with Lenny Kravitz-- just when you thought you'd heard &quot;Fly Away&quot; a hundred times too many, wait till you hear this version.  Also, Morris Day and The Time do two numbers-- I've seen The Time in concert recently; they're basically a nostalgia act at this point, but they are FUNKY.  <br />There are a few bonus features here-- the best of which are the &quot;Bonus Groovez&quot; one of which features George Clinton performing &quot;Flashlight&quot;.  Also of note is a selection of interview segments with key performers.<br />On a sour note... and don't get me wrong about this... Prince gets a little preachy at times during the show.  Prince has always incorporated sprituality in his music-- I myself am not a religious person, but I was never bothered by the spiritual side of Prince.  It was always very natural and heartfelt.  Here in this concert, &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and &quot;The Christ&quot; get a little heavy-handed with the overt preaching.  This may not be an issue for some, but for me it was a bit irritating and kind of took away from the 'party' vibe.
B000002KFJ|5.0|As much as I could sit here and point fingers at other Black Sabbath albums, This album must be at least the strongest effort among Black Sabbath fans. Many Heavy songs on here may have formed whole gyros of Metal.    1. Hole In The Sky - Heavy and very much the heavest song on here. No way not to like this song if your into metal at all. 95% . . .2. Don't Start (Too Late) - Intro to Symptom of the Universe. 70% . . . 3. Symptom Of The Universe - Heres the fastest and heavest song Black Sabbath ever has done. 100% . . .4. Megalomania - Heres the weird track for you. It is somewha quiet but spooky. 85% . . . 5. The Thrill Of It All - Good Rock song that holds this album together in a way. 85%6. Supertzar - Yes this is the song they used in the 80's for the intro in they concerts. The opera sounding stuff with Tonys guitar. 90% . . . 7. Am I Going Insane (Radio) - Well as much as people would love to destroy this song on &quot;We Sold our Souls for Rock 'n' Roll&quot; for &quot;Hole in the sky&quot; this song to me is a soft paranoid. You gotta love those errie laughs at the end of it. 95% . . .  8. The Writ - Great song that really delivers a overview of this album. 90%. . . (Bonus &quot;song?&quot; at the end of the Writ on UK import with &quot;Blow a Jug&quot;. A funny 30 second song that is Really quiet but if you tur it up preety loud you may hear it. Bill Ward &quot;lol sings&quot; this one)     . .  . If You like this album you should also try: Black Sabbath- Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Black Sabbath- Paranoid, Black Sabbath-Vol. 4, Black Sabbath- Masters of Reality, and most metal.
B0000062FL|5.0|How anyone can rate this at less than 5 stars, is beyond me. With their revolutionary fusion of Afro-Latin rhythms, rock, blues and jazz they took the music world by storm. This album has stood the test of time. It is still a best seller, and will still be selling, a hundred years from now. Listening to this album, to the sheer genius, it is hard to believe that they were all so young when this album was recorded, 22 years old on average. The bonus tracks were all recorded live at The Royal Albert Hall, London, on April 18th, 1970, and are a great addition to an otherwise perfect album.
B000003TAW|5.0|Sure, this is alternative music because of the distorted guitars and left-field subject matter. However, the punk influences are just a glossy sheen on the pure pop music that is on this album. And frankly, this is pop at its finest. The album's highlights (&quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, &quot;Undone&quot;, &quot;Surf Wax America&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;) are joyous masterpieces, with the punk accentuating the pop and vice versa. If you can listen to this album without enjoying it, you're probably dead. Weezer created not only one of the best alternative albums, but a triumph of pop as well.
6304474652|3.0|Everyone involved does a competent job.  The result is pleasant but nothing special.
B00000IPAX|3.0|Attacking Blink-182 for writing shallow lyrics may seem pointless (after all, the disc is called &quot;Enema Of The State&quot;) but it's a legitimate complaint. Nearly all the lyrics sound like fragments of a junior high locker room conversation. The only exception is &quot;Adam's Song&quot;, which is melodramatic, pseudo-deep crap. The band apparently annoys when they're being immature and annoys even more when they try to be serious.<br />However, Blink-182 did manage to write four incredibly great songs: &quot;Aliens Exist&quot;, &quot;Mutt&quot;, &quot;All The Small Things&quot;, and &quot;Don't Leave Me&quot;. Quite simply, these are unbelievably catchy punk-pop songs. Here, the band's lyrics never get too annoying and the music will never leave your brain. Also, the band sounds like they're having a lot of fun, which is a nice change from the depressed whiners out there. So this is not a great album, or even a good one, but a bad album with four killer songs. It may be worth it to pick this up just for them.
B000050XEI|2.0|I have to say that I'm disappointed with this CD and I'm generally a fan of hers.  The music is nice but it doesn't seem new (same style, same sound) and hardly seems worth the wait.  It is also a somewhat short album to be sure.  I'd say if you really like Enya and would like to hear more of her this is worthwhile, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it.  Maybe wait for it to go on sale.  Otherwise it's not much more than nice background music for me.  I'm sure she can do better.
B00000DCH9|5.0|This album is better than I thought it will be. Maybe this sound strange but I like his original albums more than Greatest Hits vol. 1 and 2. I was always surprised when I bought his original album cause he always sounds better than I expected. This album is great. Every song is perfect, especially The Ballad Of Billy The Kid,Stop In Nevada,Travellin' Prayer,emotional You're My Home and ofcourse PIANO MAN. Probably one of the best albums from 70es. I started to listen music as the big Elton's fan but I was happy when I heard Billy 'cause from that moment i know that Elton is not the only one great composer in universe at the end of twentieth century.
0553106635|5.0|A Storm of Swords is simply,the best fantasy novel ever. I thought A Clash of Kings couldn't be topped, yet Martin did it again with the third installment in the series. It's totally unpredictable and characters you thought were evil show a more benevolent side.  I couldn't put it down, and will be in agony waiting for the next book. If you haven't read the series yet, rush out right now and pick up all three books. I promise you will not be disappointed.
052594527X|4.0|Many have pondered the thoughts behind Mona Lisa's smile. In this case, we learn not of the Mona Lisa but of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Author Tracy Chevalier takes us behind the scenes of the famous painting by Vermeer and speculates on what might have been in this delightful novel. Chevalier has a wonderful knack for describing everyday life and building a subtle tension. This is a great book to read while settling down with a cup of tea on a snowy/rainy weekend.
0790743213|5.0|Upon viewing Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest for the first time, many comparisons can be made to the myriad of James Bond movies.  In this movie, a fast talking advertising executive, Roger O. Thornhill, played by Cary Grant, is mistaken for a double agent by a group of international spies as well as a murderer by police agencies.  A quest to clear Thornhill's name leads him on a quest across the country, chased by the spies as well as the FBI.  The film moves at a great pace, with such wonderful places as New York, Chicago, and Mount Rushmore as backdrops for action.  Writer Ernest Lehman (West Side Story, The King and I, The Sound of Music) and director Alfred Hitchcock (The Birds, Psycho, Vertigo) should take credit for wonderful story telling.  Few questions are left unanswered; at the same time, no questions are answered too soon, leaving the viewer in constant suspense.  We are left to wonder exactly who is the inside agent to whom the Professor (Leo G. Carroll) keeps referring.  And who is Roger Kaplan?  It was an extremely enjoyable task to put this puzzle of a story together.  Up until the final scenes, the viewer knows he or she can only trust one person: Roger O. Thornhill.  The characters in North by Northwest are all fascinating.  Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill is extremely interesting.  Though he has been thrust into a world of mystery and distrust, he never refuses a quick-witted joke in a sticky situation, providing comic relief that keeps the film fresh.  Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) provides wonder and suspense.  Can we trust her?  Who is she working for?  Dialogue between her and Thornhill gets risqu, walking the borderline of decency for the late 1950s and contributing an air of daring maturity to the script.  Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) seems always deadly, with a twinkle of cold-heartedness and anger in his eye.  Much of the script is written wonderfully, again giving kudos to Ernest Lehman.  I particularly enjoyed the scene at the auction house.  First, Thornhill confronts his would-be assassin with the quip, \\"I didn't realize you were an art collector. I thought you just collected corpses.\\"  The two men have a healthy exchange of words concluded by Vandamm exiting the auction.  Immediately, the room is surrounded by the spy's thugs, all waiting for Thornhill.  To escape, he creates a scene shouting outlandish bids and insults about the item on the auction block.  The police, of course, are called to take him away, allowing him to walk past Vandamm's hitmen with a wink and a smile in their direction, apologizing for their lost opportunity to kill him. Not only the jokes that Thornhill mockingly utters, but also the intelligence with which the scenes were written brought a smile to my face.         North by Northwest is, admittedly, James Bond-like, while leaving out all the impossible gadgets and escapes, lending an idea of possibility and reality to the story.  The most far-fetched scenes in the movie, those including the killer crop duster and the heads of Mount Rushmore, are still relatively plausible and believable by traditional spy-thriller-action standards.  Viewers may wonder how Thornhill gets involved in the drama to begin with, or just exactly how the Professor fits in with the other characters, but like I said, very few questions go unanswered.  Overall, the movie is an extreme joy to watch, enveloping the viewer in a world of intrigue and wonder.  How can you go wrong with a writer like Ernest Lehman and a director like Alfred Hitchcock?
B00003CXBK|4.0|Princess Mononoke is a wonderfully animated film; it is clear, very smooth and contains a very effective soundtrack. This quality is consistent throughout, even the voice acting in English was done well; one of the bonus features briefly addressed the difficulty in maintaining the correct verbal pacing with the animation -- the Japanese language having a quicker cadence. The visual perspective is beautifully done, giving a real sense of scale in pull away shots. The story is slightly preachy about nature conservation but not overly so and the ending is honest.<br />Now, for the reason I give this four stars and not five... personally I feel Miyazaki's Nausicaa story was much better along the same vein (although the English dubbing of Nausicaa was horrendous) and it was difficult for me not to compare the two. In spite of the bonus interviews, I felt that Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver was very good in the role) was not balanced enough makling her resolution at the end a bit disjointed.<br />It also seemed a hair too long, I know I'll get flack for this especially since I wanted more character development for Eboshi but I did glance at my watch at times and thought perhaps Ashitaka's first entry leading the wounded men into the forrest as well his healing later on could have been slightly abbreviated.<br />Minor quibbles aside, I am glad to recommend such a quality anime and fine film. As a side note, parents should preview this film as there are some very violent scenes.
B00004X01U|3.0|Nope!  This ain't it!  I love Madonna!  I have great respect for this artist.  She's been around a long time.  A vocalist she is not!  Never has been!

0525945636|4.0|Warning:  Many people who start to read this book will not be able to put it down.  As a result, you may miss some sleep unless you start reading early in the day.  I stayed up until 2:17 a.m. to finish it.<br />The story opens with an unforgettable scene.  A man awakens on the floor of a men's rest room in Union Station in Washington, D.C.  He has a terrible headache and no memory of who he is.  He finds that he is dressed like a street person, and a man awakening in another part of the rest room tells him that he passed out from too much drink.<br />The story evolves from there at solving three questions.  First, who is he?  Second, how did he lose his memory?  Third, how can he avert the potential harm that led him to lose his memory?<br />The story takes place primarily in 1958 as the United States was about to launch its first satellite, Explorer I.  Flashbacks take the action back as far as 1941, when many of the characters were students together at Harvard University.<br />When people ask me about a novel, there are a certain set of predictable questions that I get.  As I thought about this book, I realized that it had something for almost everyone.  My wife always asks me if it's a love story.  Well, this one certainly qualifies as it builds the emotional relationships between two of the leading characters over 27 years.<br />The next question is whether it is a fast read or not.  This one also qualifies, because you are pulled along by the action.<br />After that, someone always asks me if the story is like any other stories they might have read.  Well, this one has echoes of The Manchurian Candidate (about mind control and induced memory loss), the best Cold War spy novels of Le Carre (with agents, double agents, and double crosses), the unrelenting action of The Day of the Jackel (charging from one crisis to another), and many elements from Love Story (irresistible attraction being overcome by events).<br />I find that the truly successful and popular novels always add some important factual knowledge for the reader, that forever changes the reader's perception of the world.  This book contains many wonderful details about the technology behind Explorer I that I would have loved to have known before.  You will find these gems in a brief paragraph that precedes each little section in the book (divisions in time are denoted this way).  It also is mind-opening in its development of the problem how someone would find out who they are if they lost their memory and had no resources.<br />So why didn't I say that this book was a five star or higher book?  Well, it suffers from very poor editing and proofreading.  Every few pages, there is an appalling mistake that takes you completely out of the story while you focus on the mistake.  Let me give you a few examples that most people would have caught.  (1) The epilogue talks about Apollo 11 landing on the Moon and proudly proclaims that the year is 1968 in large bold type at the top of the page.  Oops!  Can people so soon have forgotten that it was 1969?  Very sloppy.  (2) The story makes a great fuss about how one of the characters will get into a house in Alabama.  Then, another character mysteriously has a key when you would expect that there was no possibility of him having a key to the house.  I was all ready for how he would break into the house, or how he would locate a hidden key.  It was a big letdown when he used a key that shouldn't have been there.  (3) One of the characters drives around in a Ford model that didn't come along for another two decades or so.  And there was no reason for Mr. Follett to even tell us what model it was.  This is pure sloppiness.  I could go on.<br />My advice to the reader is to simply expect lots of little mistakes, and to try to ignore them.<br />My advice to Mr. Follett is that he correct the worst of these errors before the next printing of what is sure to be a top selling book for some time to come.<br />Other readers who are notso generous will also quibble with using a public event that obviously turned out historically in a certain way as the backdrop for the novel.  I must admit that the story would have been more interesting if I did not know that the satellite would successfully launch.<br />Perhaps the story could have been made into a science fiction story where someone was trying to be sure that history stayed the same, along the lines of many Star Trek novels.  That would have reminded readers of even more stories they have read before.  Personally, I think that would have been a mere gimmick.<br />Perhaps the only reasonable alternative would have been to focus around a future event of significance, like the first use of high speed engines capable of approaching light speed.  But that would have meant I would never have learned all of the interesting details about Explorer I.  All in all, I'm satisfied with the choice of using this event for this story.<br />Following up on this story, I have an idea for you to consider.  Imagine yourself pursuing an adventure in which you were shabbily dressed and had no money, no credit cards, no cellular telephone, and no assistance.  How would you conduct yourself to get the resources you need and have fun doing it?<br />Always be on the lookout for the right stuff!ers who are not so generous will also quibble with using a public event that obviously turned out historically in a certain way as the backdrop for the novel.

B0000028W9|5.0|Ever satirical, Cohen asks for the return of the Berlin Wall, compares the coming of Christ to Hiroshima, describes a coming communist revolution and demands complete control of every living soul on this album and that's just the first track. Even if the voice used is obviously not Cohen's but that of a character with a distinct and twisted view of a not-too-far-fetched future, the song ranks as one of the most evil, brooding and brilliant tracks I have ever heard. Be it the pain and unhappiness of longing (Waiting for the Miracle); that semi-disappointed, carefree, erotic sense after a memorable celebration (Closing Time) or pure smitten love (Light as a Breeze) there is no odd sensation or state of mind too difficult for Cohen's poetic voice to display brilliantly. I had the same reaction to hearing the Future for the first time that I did when hearing David Bowie's The Man Who Sold the World or Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. &quot;How could I go so long without this is my CD collection!?!&quot;
B00004XONN|5.0|First, let's get one thing straight. If you thought that `Creep' was Radiohead's best song or that `The Bends' was better than `OK Computer', well, a) you need to broaden your horizons and b) you're not going to instantly love this. `Kid A' is about as far away from `Creep' as you can get. It may seem initially a strange and cold album, but after a few listens, something otherworldly emerges. The soulfulness of Yorke's voice is apparent, as is the fact that far from being an obscure and indulgent piece of work, this is a perfectly produced and sequenced Long Player with an urgency and intensity in it's songwriting that music has missed recently.   The fact that these songs are more like moods than actual `songs' is held up by the fact that only 3 songs actually contain their title in the lyrics. As such, `Everything in it's right place' is initially calm and ordered as the title suggests, before descending into an uncontrollable melee of circling voices, cut up and built up from Yorke's initially sparse vocal. The rolling electric piano builds hypnotically and a lightly groovy bassline keeps things together. The title track follows, and again it is ambient electronica, as nursery music box notes chime with a pattering drum beat. Yorke's voice is again cut up even more, this time almost completely unrecognisable. His robotic voice remains the only certainty in the song, which switches into long, ponderous synth before bringing us back again with the nursery notes. `The National Anthem' follows, it's slimy, fuzz bassline misleading in it's solidity, for the song becomes a free jazz extravaganza, with furious horns blowing in all directions. Yorke's voice is metallically distorted, and he sings `Everyone /everyone around here/ everyone has got the fear/ I'm so alone', before the invading horn section causes him to plead `Turn it off!'. The next track comes as something of a relief. `How to disappear completely'  features a Yorke vocal that is as stark as it is sparse (and for once untampered with), with a beautifully swirling and shapeless  string orchestra, and four circling acoustic guitar chords, occasionally emblazoned by a tumbling electric guitar note. Yorke sings `I'm not here/This isn't happening/I walk through walls' and the theme of self loathing and the need to hide away from modern life is more established here than on any other song. `Treefingers' is an instrumental, and this is the only song that possibly deserves any of the criticisms that have been hurled at Kid A from day one. It does sound pointless and self-indulgent and rather unexciting. It is the only disappointing track on an otherwise fine record. `Optimistic' is the much discussed traditional track, although the Radiohead of 1997 or even 1995 would never have played it. It has a brilliant live feel to it, and Yorke's voice is both tender and angry as he sings, through metaphor, of the growing problem of Capitalism. The best aspect of the track is that it's rhythm is so damn groovy, building from a snare beat to an out and out rock n roll frenzy of rapid drumming. Think Nirvana trying to do `Talk Show Host', the ending excepted, as it cools down and segues into the syncopated jazz waltz of `In Limbo'. The shortest track on the album, it is also the strangest, mainly due to having the oddest time signature ever. Jonny's country sounding guitar rolls over a light electric piano motif, whilst a very fuzzy vocal, a harsh, cold drum beat and some dirty sounding horns unsettle in the background. It has a surprisingly catchy chorus, but for the most part is totally unitelligable and is all the better for it. My favourite track on `Kid A' has to be `Idioteque', which is by far the most extreme thing this group have ever done. It has a sharp electronic beat and a thumping bass and again is surprisingly catchy. Yorke sings over himself of `Ice Age coming/let me hear both sides/we're not scared/women and children first' warning of an impending and inevitable apocalypse and grabs phrases from the ensuing panic. It is also the track that bears out the Aphex Twin influence the most, although it is not quite as bonkers as some of his stuff. It's like being drunk and puking up in the midst of a hard dance beat. It is the sound of sheer anxiety through a moment of pure joy. `Morning Bell' is the hangover after `Idioteque', centring around a brilliant, clockwork like drum pattern and a light soulful keyboard line. Lyrically, it centres on someone trying to split up with their wife, before the song switches and the central character of the song goes mad, taking the music with him too, as uncomfortable guitars build and build before stripping it all away to leave us with Colin's double bass vibrating.  The final track `Motion Picture Soundtrack' is the oldest song on the album, the acoustic guitars of yore taken away and transfused with a rusty pump organ and some angelic harps and choirs. It contains the most straightforward lyric on the album, in which Thom is seemingly crying about a dead lover, declaring his suicidal intentions to reach her. It departs with `I will see you in the next life', and you can certainly see this as the future funeral song of choice.   `Kid A' is an album impossible to sum up, not just because it is so eclectic, but also because it simply won't appeal to everyone. It's a shame that many people aren't prepared to even give it a listen, because if ever an album was a grower, then this is it.  One question remains; what the hell are Radiohead going to do next?
B00000064G|5.0|Deeply depressed, unhealthily withdrawn and convinced he had failed as a musician due to the lack of attention received by his previous albums, Nick Drake recorded Pink Moon to complete his contract with Island Records in 1972. All 26 minutes and 11 tracks of the album, recorded in two nights with no one present but Nick and an engineer feature only Drake's vocals, guitar and occasional piano. Nick dropped off the master tapes to the reception desk at Island and then checked himself into a mental hospital, swearing to never write another song. Since then, year by year, more people are turned onto this remarkable, haunting, emotionally naked album. Songs such Pink Moon and Parasite show Nick's frustration and disappointment at his world. Which Will and From the Morning show some hope for relief from the mind of this helpless soul. The 18-word Know and the 60 second Harvest Breed show how difficult it was for Nick to complete a song. But there in lies Pink Moon's ability to show a bare emotional honestly plenty of artists kill their nerves trying to produce. A pink moon is a symbol of dread and doom in many cultures which coincides with Nick's death of an overdose of antidepressants two years later.

B000002UAU|4.0|I don't think any Beatles album lives up to the hype but still, you can not help but love Sgt. Pepper's. The Beatles' songs-writing was able to creating a picture with words and sound (Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, A Day in the Life) as well as produce simple, concise pop songs that were both catchy and poignant (With a Little From My Friends, Getting Better). More than thirty years after release the album's tails of sexy meter maids and leaving a mundane home-life have offered some serious escapism for all of us lonely hearts.
B00003CX8J|5.0|No, I'm not talking about some saturday-morning animated special. It's X-Men: The Movie, and it has parallels to our real-life issues of discrimination, racism, and nationalism. You, a concerned, hyper-zealous parent, must be thinking, &quot;What the--? A super-human comicbook movie adaptation that actually contains useful material for our generation of youngsters?&quot; <br />That's right, Mrs. Censor. You see, X-Men's plot goes around the premise of a world where certain people are starting to attain magical superhuman abilities because of their genetic predisposition. Because of the way they are born, people begin to fear them and what they can do. Thus, the public gets pees their panties and wants the aforementioned &quot;freaks&quot; to be, in one way or another, contained. Any way you cut it, that's discrimination, folks. This is not by any means a shock to readers of the comics (as well as viewers of the animated TV show), since the theme of X-Men has always centered around the ideas of social acceptance and insecurity.<br />The moral depictions are pretty cool, but what other things are  cool about this movie are the way our heroes (and villians) have their super-powers visualized. I won't spoil them for you right here, but believe me when I say fans of the comicbook will appreciate the innovative effects and stunts that bring the X-Men's &quot;mutations&quot; to life on the screen.<br />This movie has its share of flaws, though. As many comic fans would have predicted, Wolverine gets the lion-share of coverage and development, while characters like Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Gray are underdeveloped. I would've liked to see more of the mentor-pupil relationship between Scott Summers and Professor Xavier that was so evident in the comics. However, Rogue was nicely characterized, subbing in for Jubilee as Logan's dependent friend and companion.<br />What can I say? The movie is deliciously great, and its low-points mean diddly-squat in the midst of its high-points. It's a comic-book fan's dream. If you like the comics, buy this film. If you don't like the comics, buy this film anyway. If you have any idea how hard it is to pull off successful comic-book film adaptations, you'll by this film right now.
B000031XCR|4.0|Well this album is great...even are missing few songs of her best...is a great album... for those music fans. THAT THINK, THAT THE FACT OF WRITE YOUR OWN MUSIC MAKES THE MUSIC GOOD... I'M TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT...Celine has a Great Voice, she has a great personality, and she offers you a great show on her concerts... The Music FAns, have to accept that there a a lot of music for everyone, there is Korn, Limp biskit, Bon JOvi, BAcstreet boys...etc.. don't try to force people think like you think...
0553106635|2.0|OK.. I've read all these reviews, and I don't get it. Every one of the books in this series practically bored me to tears. Not only that, but you have trouble rooting for anyone in particular because there are so many characters trying to take the throne. Just when you start to root for a character, Martin runs off and beheads him. He's basically wasted thousands of pages to write something he could have wrote in half of that. I'm imagining this guy basically has no clue how the series is going to end up, so he's just writing a big blob of nothing.. Is there even a point to this series?! <br />He should have made the entire series one big book, I'd have felt better. Obviously several others do not feel this way. So I suppose you have to read for yourself. He's good, but not that good.
0553274503|5.0|What would it be like to possess all you ever wished for, only to have it taken away?  The quote from Plato's Republic at the beginning of the book sums up the whole of the story.  Charlie came out of the darkness with bewildered eyes, bewildered because he was unaccustomed to the light.  Charlie fell back into the darkness with bewildered eyes, bewildered because he was unaccustomed to the dark.  Was it worth it?  That is the question we are left with at the end of the book.  It is not an easy question.  Keyes shows us all of Charlie's experiences, shows us his soul, and leaves it up to us to decide.  This philosophical dilemma is the core of the story.  And it leaves you debating with yourself.  There are convincing arguments for both sides.  But no matter which opinion you hold, you can feel nothing but love for the character of Charlie.  Pity you never feel, it is too low an emotion to give to this brave soul.  No matter what IQ Charlie has at any point in the story, you only feel love for him.  And when you weep it is not out of pity but out of sadness and grief for you know that if faced with this situation you would have gone mad long before.  Keyes does not only give us a truly great story, he gives us a truly great character which, if the world is wise, will not be forgotten.
6305320802|2.0|First things first: I love this movie -- start to finish. I love the show -- song for song. The performances here are magnificent, as is the movie-making. The whole thing is an absolute masterpiece.<br />But this DVD release is a major disappointment.<br />First and foremost, nowhere is the CinemaScope vs. Todd-AO issue mentioned. Knowing that there are two completely different versions of this movie -- filmed separately, edited differently -- but not knowing without some research which version I'm watching is completely unacceptable. (Now I know that it's the Todd-AO version on the disc.) I should be able to watch either version, or both side-by-side. (If you've never done this, try it. The two films are alarmingly different. And though the picture quality is much better in Todd-AO, the performances by the actors are significantly more relaxed and natural in the CinemaScope version. Setting technical aspects aside, without question I think the CinemaScope version is a much better, more gentle, movie. You really have to watch the two movies side-by-side simultaneously to see this, but a comprehensive DVD release would let you do just that and make up your own mind.)<br />Second, while watching this disc, there were times when it looked like it was originally shot on video tape! I think this is due to a bit of over-zealous addition of crispness, added to the already-crisp Todd-AO picture. It's a very strange experience which takes some getting used to.<br />Third, though the overture has been restored to the beginning, the opening credits are just still scans of the titles over a black background. What happened to the sweeping location shots which graced the original??<br />Fourth, the so-called extras are completely pitiful: one short trailer and three brief screens of &quot;production notes&quot;. Some of the people who made this movie (like Shirley Jones) are still around, for goodness sake, and should be enlisted for commentaries and/or a making-of documentary.<br />In summary, buy this disc only if you're curious about the Todd-AO alternate version. If not, wait for the inevitable (I hope) de luxe release at some distant future date.<br />+

0618001905|5.0|Hochschild tells the story of the Belgian colonization of central Africa very well. I want to describe it in a way that reviewers typically describe a work of fiction but it is a true story. The book is meticulously footnoted and referenced yet reads like a novel.<br />It tells the story of Leopold II of Belgium who ruled an area many times larger than his true country yet never set foot there. He was a master of P.R. who used the popular press to manipulate his way to tremendous wealth. Leopold's reign was brutal and devastating to an innocent population. <br />The stories of many other players in this era are also very well told from heros like Morel and Casement who tried to put an end to the horror to rogues like the famous explorer, Stanley. Most interesting of all of them is the story of Stanley, famous for finding Livingstone, who's true past is explored in great detail. <br />The wickedness of went on in present day Congo still echos today. This book give great insight to a sad, sad era.
B000003N7K|5.0|Romantic, Passionate and artistic Johnny Hartman has been underrated but that is no major problem since there is a little segment of humanity which is musically mature to enjoy a beautiful baritone singer like mr. Hartman in the 2000's sit down and enjoy an underground romantic.
B000021XS0|5.0|In a soceity dictated by the principles of teen pop, and music ruled not by musical talent but by the size of the crush inspired in teenage girls, it is so refreshing to see a band like Dream Theater.  Scene From a Memory: Metropolis pt. 2 is one of if not the most innovative albums of the past 10 years.  The album is opened with the timid &quot;Regression' and goes straight into the pounding &quot;Strange Deja Vu&quot;.  The beautiful thing about the album is the transition. At no point does it seem awkward, and as we learn of Victorias rebirth through Nicholas, often we go through a blairing intense song(Beyond this Life) to a sweet, melancholy song(through her eyes).  In my experience, each time I have listened to it I have discovered a new truth.  The culmination of the album is up for debate but I stand firm that it is &quot;Home&quot;, the song that reveals alot about Victoria and the cause for her death.  Amazing guitar work, especially when Petrucci makes his guitar sound like a citar in the beginning.  &quot;The Dance of Eternity&quot; is a great demonstration of the bands talents, especially Rudess's keyboarding.  &quot;One Last Time&quot; is a tragic and very touching song about the mortality in each of us.  The song that most fequently challenges &quot;Home&quot; for the climax is &quot;the Spirit Carries on&quot;.  All I can really say about that song is, what an AMAZING song.  it rocks, it touches, it could concievably move you to tears.  &quot;Finally Free&quot; closes the album and you learn the surprising truth behind Victorias death.  It's my belief that you can listen to this album a billion times, and never stop learning something new about it.  For those die-hard dream theater fans out there, you should recognize that this album is a continuation of &quot;Metropolis pt.1:The Miracle and the Sleeper&quot; off of the &quot;Images and Words&quot; album.  &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot; surpasses any album of recent years.  Certain elements of it are VERY reminiscent of Queensryche's &quot;Operation:Mindcrime&quot;(coincidentally another exceptional album), yet it stands out for it's individuality.  Dream theater KNOWS how to play there instruments, and Labrie's vocals are beautiful, and he uses the full extent of his range to perform as Victoria,Julian,Edward,and of course Nicholas.
0684853523|5.0|&quot;You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, hopefulness, or even despair-the sense that you can never completely put on the page what's in your mind and heart. You can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down names. You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page ... This isn't a popularity contest, it's not the moral Olympics, and it's not church. But it's writing damn it, not washing the car or putting on eyeliner. If you can't take it seriously, we can do business. If you can't or won't, it's time to close the book and do something else.   &quot;Wash the car maybe.&quot; <br />   This quote pretty much sets the tone for Stephen King's &quot;On Writing,&quot; a very candid and very entertaining book on the art and craft of writing fiction.<br />   And who better to write this book than a superb and prolific writer who has sold about a kazillion copies of his works. <br /> &quot;On Writing&quot; is a different type of &quot;how to&quot; book because it has heart and substance. It's written in King's unique - sometimes hilarious, sometimes gritty - voice, a voice that offers sound, no b-s advice. As a bonus, King offers some autobiographical insight into his career, which has been influenced by incidents ranging from his childhood babysitter sitting on his face to the recent, horrendous accident that almost claimed his life.<br /> This is the first book that Mr. King struggled to write after the accident. It's just one more reason to be glad that this master storyteller is still with us.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|When I saw the previews for this film I thought,&quot;This has some great potential to be heralded among the classic parodies&quot;.  However, it fell far short of that lofty goal.  I was very disappointed at the lack of imagination and forethought that went into many of the gags that were haphazardly thrown into this production.  There were a few scenes which offered hope for redemption; for example, the movie theater scene which resulted in the all too welcome death of the cell phone weilding, nuisance of a film patron.  I feel that scene got too little attention as it parallelled the overly juvenile phallic endeavors played by her homosexually suppressed, male counterpart.  Various other characters had great potential to vault this movie into the likes of &quot;Police Squad&quot; and &quot;Hot Shots&quot; with a genre that has not been touched by parodies thus far.  I've seen better from the Wayans and was tragically disappointed with what turned out to be the mental meanderings of a preverse 12 year old recorded and burned onto a DVD.
630575067X|3.0|When Episode I came out, I was just glad Leia (and you know,that Luke guy) got a mother. And I loved Natalie Portman. She's one ofthe few young actress' who have grace.<br />There is one thing I agreewith, KILL JAR-JAR BINKS. I loved Ewoks, but I hated JarJar. &quot;Live Creatures&quot; impress me more that computersimulated crap. A guy with an elaborate make up job, in a suit, or apuppet (like Yoda) can actually interact with the actors and itshows. Thier was something more realistic about the pre-specialedition Star Wars movies because of lack of money. There is adifference between rough and fake. Computer characters lookphony. Luke's Tatooine had a rough raw background. The gungans lookedfake. When you can see that it's fake, it's less intresting ---computer generated characters are not missed by the naked eye. AlsoJar-Jar's dialogue and clumsiness was a clumsy attempt at comedy thatturned away fans the way Wicket never could.<br />As a stand alone, mostpeople would not come back to the Phantom Menace. The highlyadvertised Darth Maul (who's part was to small for me to be impressedby him) has little to do... Unlike the on going war in the OriginalTrilogy, the galaxy is basically at peace and (absent of the OT) wedon't know that Palapatine is the &quot;Evil figure&quot; that willbring it all down. But the Oiginals do exsist, this is a prequel -- weknow the story --- which is part of the problem. <br />The plot issketchy at best and the characters had bad dialogue espciallyAnakin. Lloyd can't help being a cute kid --that's what he was supposeto be. How many ways can you read &quot;yipee&quot; or exclaim&quot;wizard&quot;, without coming off bubble gum cute when you ARE acute kid. As a part of the whole Saga, this was actuallyintresting. Anakin was just some kid, like any kid, meaning all of usare prone to darkness. Call me a sucker for a good romance, but hiscrush on the Queen (which we all know will turn to mutual love)actually appealed to me and I am very intrested in the future of thisromance. However, they could have dropped the &quot;choosen one&quot;- the force is his daddy - Jedi christ child angle and themidio-vermine count. Tho force was better before they made itdependant on the vermine. <br />Qui-Gon's exsistance made Obi-Wan out tobe a bigger (well more creative) liar than the Original Trilogy did.Despite this, I liked seeing Obi-Wan's simple beginings and Qui-Gonwas the most intresting character in the entire film. And his request...for Obi-Wan to train Anakin actually makes his commitment to thefamily all the more solid and important.<br />Whatever appeal it lacks asa stand alone &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, it's a great set up for astory we already know.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Polly Jean Harvey is probably the most underheard artist/musician in recorded music history. She is such a talent and not enough people are listening to her. There is nothing like her out there! Her life is what is reflected in her music. Not enough artists do that. Most artists today tend to go for the sellout, the easy single, the easy love song, the easily understood. PJ makes you think a little. Every song on this album is wonderful. Standouts are &quot;Big Exit&quot;, &quot;Good Fortune&quot;, and of course, &quot;The Mess We're In&quot; with Thom Yorke of Radiohead. So, in summary, Britney :(  -------- PJ :)
B00003CXDG|3.0|I really don't understand why everyone hates this movie. I saw it in the theatre, and later I've bought it on dvd. I think this is a very good movie, directed by John Woo( face/off, The Replacement Killers, Broken Arrow)<br />The story, I have to admit is a little bit weak, but this doesn't change my opinion about the movie. Not every movie needs to have a great storyline. The acting is not bad at all.<br />Some actions scenes are very good, that'a what you can expect of the director if u know his movies.<br />Mission Impossible 2 is pretty different to it's predecessor. I think that Mi2 is great but aimed for a younger audience like age 17 or so.<BR>I recommend you to rent or buy this movie if u like action packed sequences and not focussed to much on the story.
B00000JZIK|5.0|I've read all the reviews available, by good reviewers such as Roger Ebert, and by bad reviewers which are most of the rest, and none of them get it!  Yes, The Usual Suspects is convoluted; yes, it's hard to follow; yes, it takes some getting used to.  But in the end the Kevin Spacey character, Vocal, the con man, the guy who makes it up as he goes along, the guy who gets away with it -- he's the culprit and the source of all the intrigue, robberies, and murder.  He and his partner, the so-called Kobayashi, are the real bad guys -- and they get away with it!  If any of you remember reading Lord Jim in your high school or college days, you'll remember that two-thirds of the story is told from Jim's point of view and, consequently, we never know what's true, what's truth.  And that's what this movie is all about:  What is truth?  Do we really want to know the truth? Or are we willing to settle for what seems to be the truth?  Gabriel Byrne has made a remarkable film because he's willing to play with the audience just as he plays with both time and characters in the film.  I recommend this film to anyone who has a bit of imagination, a sense of humor (preferably off the wall), and a willingness to be confused in order to be unconfused at the conclusion.  Sort of like life?

Especially with the depthcharge scenes. this particulary scenes are realistic and well made. It really keeps you thinking how things went in World War 2. And i think that is the message from this movie. I you liked The hunt for red october an Crimson tide, you will like this one better.

B00000IAU3|5.0|This CD is a keeper. I bought this cd over a year ago after hearing &quot;Hear w/ Me&quot; on a sampler CD and have been amazed at how many times I can listen to it and never tire of the passionate songs. It is rare that every single song on an album can be so good, but these are! I was also intrigued by Dido because her brother, Rollo is in a band I like - Faithless - and he is a producer of this album. The instrumentation, Dido's vocals, the whole package is excellent. As far as comparisons go, Dido has a unique voice all her own, although I would compare her music to the Cranberries, the Sundays and Amanda Ghost, which incidentally is another recent favorite you may want to check out!

B00000ILDE|4.0|James Cameron takes over the directing chore from Ridley Scott and turns the science-fiction horror film into an over-the top action/war movie.  It's bigger and in some ways better than the first, but there's no hiding the fact, there's less surprises and less atmosphere than in the first one.<br />Ripley's character is expanded and Sigourney Weaver's performance is even better in this film than the first one.  It's more action than horror or science fiction but an exhilarating roller coaster ride of a film with deservedly award winning special effects.<br />The 17 minutes of additional footage in the special edition slows things down a little bit, but gives us important details which improves the over-all film.<br />Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

B00004Z459|4.0|Its hard to explain how this band really sounds.  It's sort of Like Limp Bizkit, but somehow, it doesn't have the fake &quot;We're bad...&quot; feel to everything. I generally like hard rock and metal, and Linkin Park combines this genre with just the right amount of rap elements. There's enough screaming to sataisfy me, but my friends who are rap fans like it because it combines rap and rock without the old sound of Limp Bizkit cutting in.  It's fresh, and they're definitely talanted. Listen to the samples, they're a good representation of what they sound like, and if you like them, you should definitely get this CD.
6305263248|5.0|Don't you wish all thrillers were this intelligent? Excellent acting, remarkable editing, and marvelous pacing make this a riveting film. The director reveals his craftmanship in his commentary that explains all the seasoned decisions he made in the production of this compelling film. As a writer, I learned something about the economy and the energy of scenes in John Frankenheimer's instructive narrative. He understands the importance of subtext and builds on that ability to create a film that is masterful in both internal and external action.
B00004Z459|4.0|[....]Even though I like way more underground stuff than this, it still never fails to grab me and pull me in. Every single song on here is stored up in my head so I can sing along at will, and every single song is packed with almost more hooks than one man can take. It's amazing how much Linkin Park can really make rapcore FUN, instead of a boring wait for something better to come along. Fun is a good word to describe this album, it's just plain awesome, a good clean fun album that just plain rocks.
0062502182|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend of mind and finished it in just a few hours.  The language wasn't particularly difficult nor was the print very small.  At first thought, it seems like a very simple tale.<br />Not so.  Like Hemingway's &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot;, a simple story is telling us story but the emphasis is not on the beautiful scenery and the clever characterization.  The story is what will hold the focus and open a wisdom which is simply stated, but very deep.<br />The book is about following your dreams.  Some of the key points are that it doesn't come without pain and misfortune.  Even though the world may be conspiring to help you, it will not be easy.  There will be the beginner's luck and there will be the seeming loss.  You must remain focused and listen to your heart if you want to reach the goal.  Many times, the shepherd boy had wealth and thought of settling for that.  He felt he had the money to buy some sheep and go back to what he knew.  He didn't however, which leads me to think that this fable is not about personal wealth.  The fact that treasure lies at the end of his journey is more allegorical than literal.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like a happy ending and anyone who want affirmation that we can be rewarded for following our dreams.

I don't know, but I certainly wouldn't watch that movie.Well anyways, to wrap it up,it's a really good movie.Also,there were not really violent or nude scenes that didn't have anything to do with the plot. Good ending,too.

Well 2 friendly ghosts scare a lot of people and leave the number of frank bannister(micheal j. fox) behind. If you have trouble with ghosts call me(something like that). Everything is fine untill he suddently sees carved numbers in peoples foreheads. This is the work of the grim reaper. A few years ago a psychally ill guy wanted to break the record of people killed by a psycopath so he kills more. They fried him but he now returned as a grim reaper figure and kills again... The dvd looks great no problems what so ever.
B00004SCX6|2.0|This is bubblegum pop at it's cavity-inducing sweetest...dare I say even more so than the debut album of Miss Spears? I unfortunately give most artists the benefit of the doubt, and even second chances...which usually leaves me 15 bucks poorer after purchasing their CD.  I had already purchased her debut album, &quot;Baby One More Time,&quot; by recommendation of a good friend who absolutely loved the album, and was disappointed. Somehow, the same friend convinced me to buy her latest album, &quot;Oops! I Did it Again,&quot; and once again I was sorely disappointed. It was nothing but fluff, electronics, and backing vocals. It sounded almost the exact same as &quot;Baby One More Time,&quot; which makes me come to believe that Max Martin is running low on new material. Britney's voice also became obnoxious after awhile, her voice isn't terrible...it's just too nasally. Not a memorable album too say the least, the only songs I even remember well enough to say anything about were &quot;Lucky,&quot; Oops!...,&quot; &quot;Dear Diary,&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; the rest are just a blur. &quot;Lucky&quot; was an okay song...not the best, but I thought it was one of the best.  &quot;Oops!...&quot; was probably one of the best choices for a single, the record company made a good move to release it...it's catchy, and seems perfectly tailor-made for the MTV audience.  &quot;Dear Diary&quot; sounded much too childish to be coming from someone as old as Britney, sounds like a page out of an 11 year olds diary. &quot;Satisfaction&quot; was just a disgrace, the Rolling Stones wouldn't be impressed. But the CD does deserve at LEAST two stars for overall effort and you must admit, it's damn catchy and at times fun to listen to. Now, even though I may be 14, and in the prime teenybopper age range, I still know what good music sounds like and this is not it. Save your money kiddies and buy yourself a Debbie Gibson album if you love cheesy pop music...all the pop goodness andstill a decent voice to boot.<br />Recommended for those who fancy artists like Mandy Moore, BSB, No Authority, etc.
B00004YYDI|4.0|Leon, that's his name. They call him the cleaner. He kills people for money, until he meets Mathilda.... Mathilda is a young girl who's entire family has been slaughtered by a corrupt DEA officer. She lives with leon and also want to be a cleaner. They do a lot of jobs together and run into the DEA officer again, its payback time.. Good action/drama movie with a lot of atmosphere..
B00004STPT|5.0|This was not only a great movie, but an awesome soundtrack.  The song Now We Are Free is beautiful, and the two songs leading up to it are awesome also.  I bought it after seeing the movie on a whim, and I didn't regret it.  The entire soundtrack is moving.
B000003BF1|5.0|The Stones have long been billed as &quot;the greatest rock and roll band in the world&quot;, which is debatable -- but there is no doubt in my mind that they are definitely the most dangerous rock band there has ever been. Let It Bleed is a case in point: even the gentle songs (of which there are what? three?) have a certain element of menace to them that other bands can only pretend to possess (the cartoonish menace of Led Zeppelin, for instance). As to the straight-ahead rockers? &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; has that dirty, bluesy Stones feel right from the get-go, with Mick Jagger and guest vocalist Merry Clayton blending their considerable abilities to perfection...in fact, Ms. Clayton just about blows Mick out of the studio, and you can hear Mick egging her on in the background -- way cool! &quot;Love In Vain&quot;, their dirgelike treatment of Robert Johnson's classic, has a pathos to it that I love (and Keith's lovely, mandolin-like sound in the play-out is magnificent). &quot;Country Honk&quot; is a rerecord of the funkier &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot;, easily as much fun to listen to as the original, with its scratchy violin and Jagger's down-home vocal. &quot;Live With Me&quot; is one of the Stones' better hard rockers, with another great Jagger vocal and truly weird lyrics. &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, another great country-blues song, has a lovely, foot-stomping feel to it. It also has some of Jagger's most controversial lyrics since &quot;Sympathy For the Devil&quot; -- not just for containing one of the earliest known references to cocaine in rock music, either. Think, really think about what Jagger is saying in the choruses, as they progress from &quot;lean on&quot; to &quot;dream on&quot; to &quot;cream on&quot;, etc. Harsh stuff for that era, and the Stones pull it off brilliantly. &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;, a great blues, embodies the album's undertones of danger better than any other song. Essentially the narrative of a serial killer (&quot;I'll stick my knife right down your throat, baby, and it hurts&quot;), the song contains some very incendiary lyrics, a down-and-dirty slide guitar riff courtesy of Mick Taylor, some of Jagger's best harp playing, and one of Charlie Watts' best-ever pieces of drumming. From the thrilling time-signature changes to the wicked-little-boy laughter you can hear from Mick and Keith in the background (listen for it just before the &quot;heard about the Bostonnnn...&quot; WHANNGG!! bit), &quot;Rambler&quot; is a true Stones classic. &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; is a minor song, but notable for being Keith Richards' most beautiful vocal effort...and that's really saying something. &quot;Monkeyman&quot;, a truly underrated part of the Stones catalog, has one of the greatest dirty guitar licks ever put down by anybody -- and again, some amazing vocals and lyrics by Jagger (&quot;I hope we're not too messianic/Or a trifle too Satanic/To learn to play the blues!&quot;). And then, closing the album off, is the crowning achievement of the 1960's Stones albums: &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot;. Forgetting for the moment that it's now been licensed for commercial use (for shame, fellas!), this song is one of the best in rock. I like to think of it as, finally, the Stones' answer to &quot;A Day In the Life&quot;. Don't follow me? Hang on a minute! The lyrics, when you look at them, seem to be stolen moments from someone's day (going to a demonstration, the Chelsea drugstore, meeting someone at a reception) -- and whereas &quot;A Day In the Life&quot; is world-weary, eerie, and elliptical, &quot;Get What You Want&quot; is straightforward (for the most part), grounded, and, while maybe not happy with the world, at least more willing to settle for the way things are, in a perfect example of idealism vs. realism. Musically, too, this song seems to provide a riposte to the earlier Beatles classic, choosing a blues-gospel sound over Lennon's folkier, jazzier direction, and picking atremendous vocal choir over a massive orchestral track. What's more, where &quot;A Day In the Life&quot; swirls up into its cataclysmic, even apocalyptic ending (the chaotic orchestra and thunderous final chord), &quot;What You Want&quot; suddenly becomes an eruption of joy, kicking itself up into ever-greater heights of wonder and energy, with the choir's endlessly-rising voices, and Watts' drums providing one final thrust of force. Of course, the rest of the band kicks some tush as well, from Bill Wyman's expert bass playing, Keith and Mick Taylor's strident, yet playful guitars, to Ian Stewart (the unsung hero of the Stones!) providing some wonderful barrelhouse piano throughout. This song, and Let It Bleed in general, seem to me to be the Coda for Sixties rock, coming as it did right at the end of the decade. Soon after, the Beatles would break up, the post-Altamont Stones would strike out in newer (though no less dangerous) directions, and many heroes of the era would perish. Let It Bleed stands in that moment, at once celebrating and mourning what has passed, casting its eye uncertainly on what is to come, yet eager to get on with it. So maybe what I said before was wrong, after all... maybe the Stones are the greatest rock and roll band in the world, at that. (NOTE: Beatles' fans, please don't think I'm denigrating &quot;A Day In the Life&quot; in any way! It is still one of the supreme achievements in rock. I'm only saying that &quot;What You  Want&quot; deserves a place right alongside, for the reasons mentioned above. Just wanted to clear the air. Thanks.)
B00004SCX6|5.0|I must say, Britney Spears is the world's most eye-on person.  Everytime I hear the name, &quot;Britney Spears&quot;, I'm love-struck.  Her first album, &quot;Baby on more time...&quot; was a smash hit, but was only little leauge compared to her latest album, &quot;Oops...I did it again&quot; has become the record breaking album of the year.  The songs replicate stories and notes from a dairy; &quot;Oops...I did it again&quot;, a story about a boy, thinking she's a nice little girl, but she's not!  &quot;Stronger&quot;, a jaming sequel to &quot;baby one more time&quot; about getting back at her boyfriend.  Finally, there's &quot;Lucky&quot;, a sad story about a famous (and snotty) girl who then gets sad and lonely because she has no one to love.  The list pretty much goes on with great songs.  A definate buy.  I love you, Britney!

B000002UAF|5.0|Everyone knows how great this stuff is, therefore I do not need to comment.  I just had to say how amused I was by the text offered in some of those one-star reviews.  I could just hear the ditzy preteen voices uttering those words in my head and had to laugh.<br />Check 'em out.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|OK, this is probably one of the most vulgar movies out.  It even beats the apple pie scene in American Pie.  But, come on, you have to admit you can't help but laugh.  It was funny.  I really feel this should have been an NC-17 rated movie from the get go, but I'm not in charge of that department.  Don't let your kids watch it, but take a chance, rent it and let your inhibitions fly out the window.  I'm not sure if this is one I'll add to my collection.  But if I do, it'll have a nice place next to my copy of American Pie.<br />BTW, my favorite scene was probably the most disgusting, so I can't describe it.  But I'll never look at chainsaws the same way again.
6302424887|5.0|Out of the two great versions of MACBETH that I've seen, Orson Welles' and Roman Polanski's, I prefer Polanski's version. Polanski brilliantly adapted the play to the silver screen. MACBETH is an eerie, brutal, suspenseful, thought-provoking film. Many complaints can be heard concerning an unnecessary level of violence in the film. They are untrue. The brutality of the film only strengthens the points made in Shakespeare's play, the central ideas of betrayal and revenge. Polanski's MACBETH is a legendary piece of work.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I teach second grade.  Needless to say, I have come to know the X-men as humans who have very special qualities which are used to fight crime.  When this movie was in the theatre, I absolutely refused to see it when my friend asked me to go. I'm not a science fiction fan and don't read comic books.  I also don't watch cartoons.  Why in the world did you rent it, you may be asking.  There was nothing else to rent so I decided to take a chance.  I'm glad I did.<br />I can't really explain the movie because it was unique.  I base my feelings about movies on suspense.  Did it keep me interested?  Did I fall asleep?  Did I find myself reading a book instead of watching it?  I found myself answering &quot;yes&quot; to the first question.  If you aren't one to enjoy sci-fi, rent it and see if you too might like it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I'm not the type of person to enjoy &quot;macho&quot; movies like Gladiator and The Patriot, but I immensely enjoyed both of them.  Maybe my head has been in the sand, but I didn't really know who Russell Crowe was (excluding his romance with Meg Ryan) but now find myself a true fan.  His acting is extraordinary and the story line allows us to look a little bit into the past.  I never liked history in high school but find myself more interested in it as movies come out which tell a little bit about the past (yes, I realize they are &quot;Hollywoodized&quot; somewhat-I'm not that naive! :-)  ).<br />More than the movie, the bonus material is fantastic.  If you have read any of my other reviews, I am mainly a fan of DVD's because of the bonus materials.  I like to know what goes on behind the scenes and to learn a little more about the actors involved.<br />If you like suspense and drama, Gladiator is for you!
B00003CXIY|3.0|I'm a big fan of American Pie.  I decided to rent Road Trip and was pleasantly surprised that it had some funny scenes.  Even &quot;old people&quot; (people over the age of 17  :-)  )  can find some humor in it.  I suggest you rent it when your brain doesn't want to think too much and you have some leftover popcorn to eat.
6305538018|5.0|I've seen a lot of really cool movies in my life, but this is one of the best, most intriguing movies i've ever seen. I always wanted to see a movie that made you think about what was going on, and so far no movie has matched up. People compare eXistenZ to the matrix but what it is really more like is the first few episodes of the show &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. The Outer Limits is the only other thing i've seen that could come close to the amount of thinking it takes to watch eXistenZ. I didn't get this movie real well but thats because i only saw it once (so far) and missed the first 5 minutes of it. But those first five minutes could change the whole way I think about this movie. I'm rambleing now but if you really want to see a awsome sci-fi, brain picking thriller, then this movie is for you.

B000002OX7|5.0|Not much can be said about this album except that it may not be the best album ever but there is none better. Being a fan of classic rock probably because I was a teenager during the early 70's, I believe there is no better rock album or group than The Who. I don't compare them to The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, or Led Zeppelin because each band is great in their own right. They have completely different sounds. I have seen all of these groups several times over the years except The Beatles. There is no weak song on this album. I have always said it's like a greatest hits album. Most groups wish they had a greatest hits album as good as Who's Next. This is just another Who album though. A great one on the level of Tommy and Quadrophenia. This CD contains tunes that The Who play in concert always as BaBa O'Riley, Behind Blue Eyes, My Wife, and the anthem Won't Get Fooled Again. If you have seen The Who in concert several times then you have probably heard all of these songs from this CD performed at one time or another. Any fan of classic rock owns this album. It is a must have. Like I said before I don't believe you can say what the best group is or CD is, but there is none better than this one. Just like there is none better than any other classic albums like The Dark Side of the Moon, The Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore, Get Yer Ya Ya's Out, Deep Purple Made In Japan, or Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

6304383177|3.0|I give this film only three stars based on the measure of a comedy: how much laughter it produces.  This film induces some chuckles, but never gasping, roll on the floor laughter.  Maybe it's a generational thing: I'm thirty-something.  Cary Grant is a bit too prissy in his role for my taste, but Hepburn is great as a Lucille Ball-like walking disaster.  The pacing is fast, and the film is never dull.  Interestingly, this film bombed at the box office.  It only picked up its reputation as a classic years later.  Perhaps viewers were more discriminating back then.
B00003CXDF|1.0|zzzzz. wow. what a movie. yawn.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Personally, I think most people are being too hard on this album. Yes, there is a lot of bad material on here, but there are also some incredible tracks that more than make up for the low points. The musical content on this album is excellent, all the instrumentalists are very talented, but its the lyrical content that fails. Fred Durst can write some really powerful material when he tries, this album goes to prove it, unfortunately, most of his other work on this CD is less than desirable.<br />On this album, Limp Bizkit seems to both improve in some areas and completely lose it in some others. In my opinion, this album has Limp Bizkits best material on it, along with some of their worst. Major highlights from this album include some of their traditional moshing songs, such as the incredibly funny (and offensive) &quot;Hot Dog,&quot; along with the first version of &quot;Rollin,&quot; which is not all that great if you break it down lyrically, but, like &quot;Nookie&quot; from Significant Other, its a lot of fun to listen to, so why hate it then? Other so-so songs include &quot;The One,&quot; &quot;It'll Be OK&quot; and &quot;My Generation,&quot; which is OK, but after hearing it 100+ times on the radio I got a little sick of it. Still, the real highlights are what I consider to be Limp Bizkits two greatest songs, the incredibly powerful Mission Impossible 2 theme &quot;Take A Look Around,&quot; which not only flat out rocks but also has real depth and meaning to it. The other golden gem here is the mellow &quot;Hold On,&quot; an incredibly emotional and deep song that is completely unlike anything Limp Bizkit has ever done before, and is the closest thing to a ballad that any of the newer metal-rap bands have put out in the last few years.<br />Unfortunately, with the good comes the bad, the bad comes the good, and there is quite a bit of bad here, also. When Limp sticks with their usual hardcore or mellow rock style, they're fine, even with a touch of hip-hop. But when they wade out into deep rap territory, the product is an incredibly irritating, lyrically uninspired song well worth skipping over. &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; is mindless from beginning to end, and Freds whiny voice is especially noticable on the second version of &quot;Rollin.&quot; Fred, along with several guest rappers, make this an incredibly boring song that gets old REALLY fast, but it lasts a full 6 1/2 minutes.<br />Like I said, this album has some of the best material that Limp Bizkit has ever done, so it is definitely a must own for all their fans. And, despite all the low points, the stronger tracks where worth my money.
0684853523|5.0|Words can describe the magic of the man who is... Stephen King. No! I take that back, not a man, an extraordinary legend who put the 'w' in writing. A King fan or not, an aspiring writer cannot go without this masterpiece. On Writing combines his life with his craft. It tells of his joys and struggles of youth in such description as Angela's Ashes or This Boy's Life, in a couple of paragraphs. Such is King's simplicity that you'll wonder why you never wrote a story before.       I first started reading King when I was ten (somebody had left a paperback copy of The Shining on an airport bench when I was going on holiday- I simply decided to start reading it and page by page became more entranced by King's superb brilliance- and have never looked back). I am now thirteen and have purchased over thirty copies of his stories.      Ask a general bystander -I prefer to call them King Virgins- on a street if they have heard of the legend, and they will shudder and the first thing that will come to their minds will be: HORROR. Not so. Many of King's novels are in fact general. Many of his best have not been horror, i.e. Different Seasons (including Stand By Me, a personal favourite, and Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption), The Green Mile, the Dark Tower series, Bag of Bones and such.      Remember; Heroes live forever, legends never die. Stephen King can only live on and on doing what he loves. He is an artist in his own profession, a sheer perfectionist. No one can or should say otherwise. He is an artisan and a genius. Read and be amazed.

I heard too much screaming and over rated. man they were wrong, non stop power playing full of soul and man it is great. this has too be one of my favorite cds ever. if you love music that is real go and get this. this is one of those bands that i really want to see in concert. i hope that thier other cds are this good because i am getting them all!!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I am in high school and have been a Beatles fan since the dawn of my time (thanks in part to my parents.)  My dad has most of the origional records which I have listened to endlessly.  As soon as Beatles 1 came out I had to get a copy.  While I admit that some of the favorites are absent, it is an incredible collection for any fan.  It revives passions for the enormous popularity of the Beatles and also opens the doors for a whole new spectrum of listeners.  Beatles 1 deserves more than five stars...it is the album of a lifetime.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  This collection of &quot;#1 hits&quot; (whatever the creators take that to mean) is fantastic listening and a good sampler for veteran fans and new fans of the Fab 4.  But where are some of the Beatles' absolute best?  Particularly disappointing are the omissions of &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;, &quot;In My Life&quot;, &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, and &quot;Revolution.&quot;  Go ahead and buy this CD, but if you like what you hear, buy the Red and Blue greatest hits set and maybe even some of the Beatles' individual albums.

B000005JA8|5.0|This album owes much of its cult status to its actual unlistenability. I can hardly imagine anyone listening to this and liking it at first hearing. In fact, most people probably won't give it another try and who can blame them? Iconoclastic and idiosyncratic are nice words that come to mind when reviewing this album.<br />Unconditionally guaranteed is the easy one for starters, but this one is the holy grail of weird pop blues music. I gave it 5 stars: it's truly a landmark album that needs to be considered for any serious collection.<br />The music is weird: most of the time all band members are playing in another time and quite possibly another tuning as well, the lyrics are absurdist and songs ack a normal song structure (such as refrain, verse, refrain, verse, bridge, verse, refrain, refrain and fade). And yes, his voice takes some getting used to.<br />The reward however will be all yours....
B00004STPT|5.0|I owned the soundtrack before I saw the movie and I liked it so much I was dying to see the movie. The main theme (heard at the beginning of the third track especially) is what I really love about it. It's a moving theme--literally. But the theme doesn't take over the entire album. There's a whole lot of variety and different tunes on this album. The vocals make it sound almost haunting, and the brass and strings--the way Zimmer uses them-- make you want to stand up when you hear them. Well, for me at least. This is one of those soundtracks that you could almost drown in the sound of. I love turning the volume way up and letting the music just permeate the air around me. I don't really have any favorite tracks (well--maybe The Barbarian Horde), I love them all. The last track leaves you moved beyond words. Lisa Gerrard's vocals capture the emotion and movement of the film, as does Zimmer's music. Hans Zimmer is a great composer. There's nothing boring about this soundtrack.

B000005RUV|5.0|I think this CD is awesome. (this opinion is coming from a 13 year old girl too! HAHA!)! All the songs rock!<br />If you like Wham!, check out my favourite band, soulDecision! They sound like George!!

B000002KBU|5.0|I don't write this review to convince anyone to either buy or not buy this album.  Whether you like it will depend on you.<br />I write this simply because this has been my favorite album for nearly 30 years, since the day I picked it up at E.J. Korvette's the day it was released.<br />I was totally disappointed with this album.  It just wasn't as &quot;folky&quot; as her previous work had been.  (Needless to say, I'd have difficulty with the directions Joni's music would take in the future.)<br />Somehow, though, it turned into the one album that consistently moves me in ways that no other music ever has.<br />Although my musical tastes have changed over the years (I not ashamed to admit I was into disco in the 70s and my favorite artist nowadays is Madonna) this album has held a special place in my heart.  There are so many memories of so many times in my life that are tied up in these songs; there were even years where I couldn't listen to this album, but it still remained my favorite.<br />I was well into adulthood when I realized that &quot;Oh, Canada&quot; was the Canadian national anthem.  It was only a couple of years ago that I noticed the irony in &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard.&quot;  The meaning in the songs keeps changing.<br />And &quot;A Case of You&quot; always devastates me.<br />If you are young, I hope that you are lucky enough to find some music that will stay with you all your life.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is without doubt the best Iron Maiden album ever made. It is even better than that 1988 masterpiece Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. It is one of the best metal albums ever made, and arguably one of the landmark albums of our time.<br />Like many Iron Maiden fans, I thought Maiden died in the Nineties ... doomed to produce garbage like the X-Factor and Virtual IX until they faded into complete obscurity. How wrong I was. With Bruce Dickinson (and Adrian Smith) back fronting England's greatest export, Iron Maiden is back to its former glory -- and more.<br />If you are a Maiden fan, this album is a must-buy. If you are a metal fan, this album is must-buy. If you are a fan of good rock music, this album is a must-buy. In fact, if you enjoy good music, this album is an essential addition to your collection.<br />UP THE IRONS!
0553106635|5.0|martin's gift for character development, coupled with his keen ear for dialogue, makes for a compelling read. but, i have one question.  after killing most of the &quot;good guys&quot; that we identified with, and after killing most of the &quot;bad guys&quot; who gave the book it's rotten core, who are we supposed to root for and against?  i mean he's literally offed most of the interesting characters.  i can't see the next book revolving around stannis baratheon or walder frey.  like others, i'm sure it will be worth the wait.  highly recommended.
B00003CXE7|5.0|The first time i saw this was on DVD.  My friend who is really into movies kept on telling me to see it.  Finally I bought it on DVD. Afterwards I was like wow what a great movie.  Its has the same kind of underdog that rises to the occasion. In all the commercials about the movie they portrayed it as being an action packed movie and being basically a guy movie.  The plot of this movie is the best part.  Any women would be crying at the end of it. The action seen are great but the plot is by far the best i have ever seen.  It is my new #1 movie.
B00004X01U|2.0|I had recieved Madonna's music for Christmas because I am a big Madonna fan and after listening to it I'm sorry to say that I'm not impressed. First of all,I do like the album's title track and the Maxi-single of the mixes was very good, but the rest of this album I just didn't care for. I am used to Madonna's dance music and I Just have to say that Techno just isn't for her. And a lot of the lyrics on this album aren't as sexy and imaginative as I know madonna to be. To save you dear reader time there is just something about this album that isn't Madonna and I just can't think of the right words to describe it. Hopefully with her next album Madonna will drop the cowgirl charade and get back to her Dance Music roots.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|I don't consider myself the biggest Hitchcock fan, though i did enjoy vertigo, this has to be favourate. Beuatifully filmed (look out for that helicopter) with some great twists and turns, this is probably one of the best chase films in quite some tome. Despite its age its very fast paced and also very funny, something of a rariety in most of Hitchcock's flicks. Extremely brittish, and extremely well written and acted, it has to be one of the best brittish films ever made (definitely topping the third man in my list) along side an ending to die for, what more needs to be said. Buy, watch and enjoy.
B000000JO3|5.0|hey, if you u like punk rock this cd's for u.  the lead singer (ian mackaye) is the original straight edger.  the music is awesome.  good riffs on guitar and bass.  the drum beats are really great.  these guys just plain out kick butt.  (i like these guys a lot.  they rock harder than anything i've heard yet.)  this music is for people who like bands like fugazi, bad brains, green day, nofx, ect..  so pick this one up today!
B00003CX8I|2.0|First, what was the point in the introduction in the movie where it's WWII Poland? Who cares about that? <br />Second, according to the comic books : Wolverine is alot shorter, meaner, and a better fighter. Rogue is older and taller-- not to mention more sexier-- plus she can FLY and lift up to 50 tons! Cyclops is older and muscular. Phoenix (Jean Grey) is extremely powerful! Storm has or had a mohawk. <br />Third, where's Nightcrawler? Colussus and Beast? Why was Storm played by Halle Berry-- she's too light skinned and not tall enough. They could've casted Iman or Naomi Campbell. <br />Fourth, why wasn't this movie played at it's original run time which has 80 minutes of footage cut out from it? The hell with the morons who have to sit through it and try to UNDERSTAND the movie. Let them see Batman 4.
B0000203Y5|3.0|i own the cd and i love the music.  recently i did a project on afro-cuban music and the way castro censors things that could be considered against the revolution.  i went to this documentary to see if there was any information on this topic, but there was none.  according to agustine blazquez, cuban exile, jounalist, and filmmaker, this documentary as well as other movies and cds and performers that have come to the US through cultural exchanges are people that are loyal to castro therefore they are able to go on tour.  those that aren't loyal to the revolution don't get any support from the cuban government.  there is nothing in this movie that talks about the restrictions that are placed upon the performers, it makes it seem like everything is ok and wonderful, when that is not the case.  i'm not critisizing the music or the musicians, they are all magnifisant and awesome.  It's just the way that their lives are portrayed that make me wonder of the accuracy of this movie.  also, i was fortunate enough to see the buena vista social club live at the orpheum theater in boston, they blew me away.  the music is incredible, if you have the chance to ever see them live, do it.  overall, good footage of the recording studio and capture of the artists personalities, accuracy however on life in cuba is a little sketchy.
6305313687|5.0|Despite the fact the movie was disturbing in it's portryal of racism, it's the only way to do it, you can't lie and make racism seem less than it really is, or the movie has much less effect.  Not one person who watches this movie can be unmoved by it, it is an accurate and powerful portrayl of racism, and you will be shaking your head and thinking about this movie for days to come after watching, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is one of the best books ever written. It is a classic novel. This book by Harper Lee does a great job of describing events and keeping the reader hooked on the book. I am only in 8th grade and this book is by far my favorite. This book took place in 1933-1935 (the depression) It does a good job describing prejudoce back then and how one thing that a black says or does even if it is the truth can be not true by a white saying something else which is what you'll learn in this book. I would recommend it for all ages.
B00003CXDG|5.0|It is a visual masterpiece and a MUCH easier plot than the first Mission Impossible.  Just don't let the horrible shooters, overly done explosions, and other things of this nature get in the way of the movie, focus on what you r watching and enjoy it, its awesome, highly recommended
B000000OQF|5.0|this is the same album my cousin gave me when i asked for a tape to listen to in my first tape player.. i still own that tape and i bought the cd just to keep my collection filled with some of the best albums out there... if you wish to have one of the best albums to pump you up before the big meeting or game or whatever situation applies this is your album
0792157850|3.0|THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is disappointing when compared to the 1st and 3rd films in the series. This movie is campy, boring, badly acted, badly written, and even the action scenes aren 't that exciting. You should buy the other ones but forget about this one.
B0000060AK|5.0|&quot;Ariodante&quot; (1735) was intended for some of the leading performers of Handel's time. Stiff competition from Nicola Porpora and the threat of bankruptcy `forced' Handel to write works of higher quality for the first time since the Big Three: &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; (1724), &quot;Tamerlano&quot; (1724) and &quot;Rodelinda&quot; (1725). <br />Two things make &quot;Ariodante&quot; and its sister opera &quot;Alcina&quot; (1735) exceptional: 1. singers of the four major voice categories (i.e. soprano, alto, tenor and bass). Often Handel operas do without low male voices, e.g. &quot;Teseo&quot; (1713) and &quot;Amadigi&quot; (1715). 2. the services of the notorious French ballerina Mlle. Salle and her ballet troupe.   <br />The instrumentation of &quot;Ariodante&quot; is not as grand as in &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, &quot;Rinaldo&quot; (1711) or &quot;Teseo&quot; which are designed to make a splash and to ravish the senses. In &quot;Ariodante&quot; the orchestra is `down-scaled' to strings, oboes, horns and continuo - a trumpet also appears when Ginevra is vindicated. Handel utilises the orchestra in such a way that the sound world varies from one aria to the next to capture the right mood to reflect and propel the drama.   <br />Minkowski is onto something great with his version - and what an inspired reading it is! He keeps the drama moving at a fast pace (maybe too fast sometimes, like Dalinda's final aria). It's hard to believe it, but the singers and wonderful orchestra keep up with him in this live recording. <br />Minkowski has Anna Sofie von Otter as Ariodante, the role created for the talented castrato Cusanino. Handel wrote exceptionally demanding and expansive coloratura arias for Cusanino (see Teseo's arias in &quot;Arianna in Creta&quot;). Von Otter sings with a clinical precision that can be hard to listen to at times and her already androgynous voice does not lend much appeal to her interpretation; like Fischer-Dieskau she tries to colour every note and syllable to make it more meaningful - too much spice is just as undesirable as too little - but she sings the zipping coloratura of the first version of &quot;Con l'ali&quot; with unequalled skill! For me &quot;Scherza infida&quot; suffers the most from her overbearing colouration of the vocal line, and &quot;Dopo notte&quot; does not touch Janet Baker's first exulted recording. Nonetheless, I think few mezzos today can equal von Otter in this repertoire.  <br />The Ginevra, Lynne Dawson, delivers an uneven performance. In moments Dawson's singing can be exquisite and in others painful. She does have a very beautiful voice, but at times she sounds strained. The demands placed on Anna Strada del Po, who first created this role, seem unreasonable at first - until you listen to Edith Mathis do justice to this role on the Leppard set.   <br />Veronica Cangemi sings Dalinda. Her runs are delivered at a cracking pace - and one wishes sometimes that Minkowski had given her more breathing space, literally and figuratively. Even in the more reflective moments her character comes off like Blondchen on 78 speed. But she delivers the goods at all times.<br />Ewa Podles sings (&quot;sings&quot; being the understatement of the century) Polinesso. Nothing can quite describe how Podles transforms Polinesso's less spectacular music into something special. She delivers the most outstanding performance on this recording, turning every aria into a Gala Event! No words can convey the talents of Podles: coloratura, high notes, low notes, long phrases - none holds any terror for this incredible ARTIST. Perfect diction, perfect colouration of the vocal line without resorting to ham effects make it a complete mystery why this underrated singer is not more widely recorded. <br />Richard Croft as Lurcanio has the least interesting character next to Odoardo in this opera, but he brings Lurcanio to life in his arias. Croft's &quot;Il tuo sangue&quot; is probably one of the most excitingrecorded Handel arias ever. <br />Denis Sedov as the The King has a beautiful, full and flexible bass voice. He has a few stunning arias, and he delivers a very fine performance.<br />&quot;Ariodante&quot; can really be seen as Handel's &quot;Cosi&quot;. In both operas the focus is on the emotional turmoil of the characters and not the social implications of their actions. Two moments stand out here: the sinfonia introducing Act 2 and the first Ariodante/Ginevra duet. The King interrupts them before they can continue with the da capo! <br />&quot;Ariodante&quot; is not just pretty music. Handel was always ahead of his contemporaries: in &quot;Io ti bacio&quot; Ginevra leaves her father to await execution. The introduction consists of four notes in the continuo. Then the violins alone accompany the vocal line in unison until all the instruments join in harmony on a Neapolitan chord - the 18th century chord to convey great despair. Most revolutionary is the second Act ending with an accompanied recitative to reflect Ginevra's madness - in the Baroque era this is unheard of. Then there is the intimate Lurcanio/Dalinda duet which starts of as an aria for Lurcanio, but when you expect the B section to start Dalinda joins, and what magic, what bliss, when their voices unexpectedly unite in harmony at the end with the tenor singing a 3rd above the soprano - very Puccini! Mozart is said to have remarked: &quot;Handel understands effect better than any of us - when he chooses, he strikes like a thunderbolt...&quot;<br />I cannot resist mentioning the consecutive arias: Ginevra's &quot;Volate amore&quot;; The King's &quot;Voli colla sua tromba&quot; and Ariodante's &quot;Con l'ali di costanza&quot; which caused Burney to complain of Act 1 having nothing but &quot;wings and flying&quot;!<br />In closing: &quot;Ariodante&quot; appeals to our human and romantic nature, and unlike &quot;Lotario&quot; does not deal with the fate of nations, but rather the emotions of the individual. All these factors, and I wager the reduced orchestra, make us focus on the dark, distressing and mysterious atmosphere which pervades over this opera and its characters, an atmosphere perhaps only equalled in Wagner's &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. I look forward to Minkowski's reading of &quot;Arianna in Creta&quot;.
6305907145|1.0|This movie is horrible, the acting is flat.  You never get an in-depth characterization.  The movie is too short for that.  Why did they have to drag in so much filth (oral sex with slaves)?  If you want to see a superb version of Mansfield Park, get the BBC version!
0060931736|4.0|I remember reading this book in high school, like most of the reviewers on this page. And, like most of the reviewers here, I recall that at the time I found this book incredibly boring; its only redeeming quality was that it ended after 150 pages. It has been 6 years since I was subjected to Brodie, and I've read hundreds of books since then, yet for some reason Brodie is one of only a handful of novels that has truly remained with me. Miss Brodie, so arrogant and destructive, and Sandy, who goes through what can only be described as one of literature's most trying adolescences, are two of the most deeply human characters one will encounter in 20th century English literature. Add to that a strong feminist undercurrent and a unique perspective on pre-war politics, and you have a recipe for an enduring classic. Spark is a very good, though not immensely talented writer, (which might explain why this book is so difficult for high school students to get through) but she succeeds in crafting an interesting group of characters, and has a great deal to say for such a short novel. So, for all the students who end up reading this book in 9th grade English, I would say that even if you don't enjoy the book now, there is a reason why it is being taught; it is one of those little novels, like To Kill a Mockingbird or The Catcher in the Rye, that almost everyone who reads through it is ultimately better for. For anyone else looking for a quick read that will stick with them, I recommend this title without hesitation. It is certainly not the greatest book ever written (as dozens of young reviewers can certainly attest) but it is deserving of its status as one of the 100 best of the 20th century.
B00003CX8J|4.0|This was a very good movie.  I've been reading the comic book for about twenty years now, and I appreciated the handling of both the characters and the themes.  Of course, as a long-time reader, there were a few things I might have done differently, but to each his own creative vision.  Several people who have not read the comic also enjoyed it, which led me to believe that this succeeds in just the right way, reaching beyond those of us who were already fans and engaging the general public.  Handling comic books in the movies is always tricky, trying to stay true to the material, and not seem foolish at the same time.  The right balance was struck with this movie, and I feel I can safely recommend this to anyone who enjoys action movies.<br />My only hesitation about the DVD is the extra ten minutes of footage.  My guess is that there is better extra footage on the floor of the cutting room, and this doesn't add much to the movie.  The real problem is the way the footage is spliced into the movie.  Luckily, you can turn that option off and watch the movie as it was presented in the theatre, leaving the extra stuff for another time.<br />There are also two wonderful Easter Eggs hidden on the disc (most notably Hugh Jackman's screen test) that are certainly worth finding.
0805211063|5.0|I have read the Muir and the Harman translations and I feel the Harman version is a restoration of Kafka's Castle to the english language. Sentences are often long and punctuation sparse, this brings out the intended atmosphere of the novel which is close to surreal. The literary critics have posited numerous interpretations of the Castle but beware about becoming too dogmatic about any of them. This novel defies easy explanation and is purposely enigmatic. K. experiences many setbacks, switchbacks, and confusions on his trail to his goal, even his goal is an enigma to himself. Just as in life when we believe we have the answers disillusion is not far behind, K.'s struggles are thwarted and he thinks he's getting somewhere only to find he must constantly re-assess his position.  It is so appropriate that this novel ends in mid sentence.
B00003CXBK|5.0|It made a lot of people's top ten list, I know.  But I think they needed to watch it again.  This was, in my humble opinion, the best movie that came out in 1999.  It's a shame it didn't get a broader release in the theatres, but I'm glad it came to my town.<br />There is something horrible and beautiful about nature, and this film shows that in a number of stunning ways.  Man's treatment of nature is more horrible because it is not malicious but ignorant.  While that comment might make the film sound preachy, it's anything but.  It is personal and touching in ways that are difficult to express.  We care about these characters, and they are real.  No one here is truly evil, but their different attitudes and goals bring them into conflict.  The lack of a villian might seem strange to mainstream American audiences, but it is a refreshing change of pace.<br />Everything about this movie is wonderful, the art, the plot, the characters, the voices, the music.  The DVD is especially nice because it includes the original Japenese language tracks and subtitles, so those who are interested in purity of anime will be happy as well.
B00004VVNB|3.0|Coming out before the &quot;Star Wars&quot; phenomenon, &quot;Logan's Run&quot; didn't have the advantage of a studio wanting the effects work to be better. So, what you get is a good story and decent acting wrapped in effects work that is laughable. Especially now, with the sharp picture afforded by DVD, you can see the wires of Carrousel and be amused by the miniatures which probably were state of the art at the time. Given the opportunity, Michael York and Jenny Agutter make an engaging couple even if there is no real basis for their relationship except to move the story forward. Sir Peter Ustinov, as an eccentric old man, shows why his career has lasted 60+ years with a superb performance. Then, there are the star-billed, blink and you'll miss 'em, performances of Roscoe Lee Browne and Farrah Fawcett-Majors. The former unrecognizable under tons of make-up as Box, the latter just painful to watch as Holly.<br />The story itself holds up well, and the performances of the leads is worthwhile. All in all, this one is a step below must see, but a fun diversion when you've got nothing else to watch. Just don't expect much from the &quot;special&quot; effects.<br />Third billed Richard Jordan was a decent actor who seemed to get a decent role once every decade or so. From the deadly serious he plays here, to the comic foil in &quot;The Secret of My Success,&quot; to a posturing bureaucrat in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; he was a gifted actor. His extensive resume is worth a look at imdb.com.
B00000DCHI|5.0|This is the best collection of Billy Joel's songs. It has my favorite Joel songs such as, &quot;It's Still Rock and Roll To Me&quot;, and &quot;Uptown Girl&quot;. And you've got to love, &quot;You May Be Right&quot; and &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot;. This beats his volume 3. The only thing this album is missing is, &quot;Why Should I Worry&quot;.

0780626494|4.0|Adam was cocooned in a bomb shelter since his birth.  His family had been trapped in there since the 1960s.  His parents taught him everything they could, from languages to dancing.  Although Adam had become quite knowlegeable but he was still naive in a way without any exposure to the real world.  When he had a chance to go out in the world with a grocery list from his mother, he created so many hilarious situations.  Then when Adam met Eve, she helped him out with his very long shopping list.  She believed Adam to be from Alaska and yet when she found him to be so knowledgeable and even know how to dance so well, she began to doubt that.  Adam did not even know how to explain that he was from underground (He lived in a bomb shelter, remember?)  I have found myself laughing out loud throughout the show.<br />If you are a romantic comedy fan, you gotta watch this!
B000001FBM|5.0|Detroit Rock City is a barnstorming concert song and a great begining to the album.  It rattles along like a nuclear missile on fire and then breaks into King of The Nightime World and Gene Simmons' bone-crunching God of Thunder.  Great Expectations is a raunchy and interesting but Flaming Youth and Sweet Pain are pure filler.  Shout It Loud picks up the pace as does Peter Criss' Beth before Do You Love (officially) ends the album.  The 'untitled track' is creepy and hads a great touch to the record.  All in all it's ONE of KISS's best although Revenge, Creatures of The Night, KISS and of course Alive (2/3) Unplugged etc are better.  That said, it kicks but exactly 25 years after it was recorded!
B00002MZ4V|5.0|A disc one buys in order to have E.T., Superman, Indiana Jones, The Imperial March, Jurassic Park, Home Alone, Jaws and Schindler's List all in one place, and on which one discovers tremendous delights like Far and Away, JFK, Born On The Fourth of July, the Parade of the Slave Children from the Temple of Doom, and a version of the Star Wars theme which manages to be different from the other five copies of it one might happen to have.  The Star Wars theme seguays from the opening credits music into the familiar ending credits arrangement quite smoothly.  Only part I found to be significantly overrated was Saving Private Ryan's Hymn To The Fallen.<br />A terrific buy and yet, of course, not an excuse not to buy some of the originals, particularly those of the Star Wars variety.  I would warn though that, by my judgment, the supremely valuable 3 minutes and 42 seconds that one gets of E.T. here is an extremely wiser purchase than the very long and very boring soundtrack on which it is the only exciting moment.   The surprise highlight moments for me have to be the Home Alone theme which rivals Edward Scissorhands in quality and effect and Far and Away which showcases Itzhak Perlman's ability to make a violin dance.  Having only known his work from the Schindler's List soundtrack, I was delighted to find this track with him here.
0671034065|5.0|Although the basic premise is hard to swallow, the story flows well once you accept that making a list of qualities for &quot;Mr Perfect&quot; could get you on Good Morning, America.  It's Jaine and Sam that make the story-- the characters have witty dialogue, sparkling attraction and real-life characteristics. This book is worth the hard-cover price if for nothing but the hero-heroine interaction.
6305426651|5.0|Benigni gives an outstanding performance in the World War II story. Anyone who thinks Benigni is just a comedic actor will find themselves surprised by his touching portrayal as a loving father devoted to his family during the Holocast.  Do not be deceived by reviews that say this film is a comedy/drama. This film is very dramatic and serious. The comedic touches come in when Benigni's character does everything in his power to shield his young son from the horrid situation around them.  Watch Benigni's face during this film, and you will see one of the best acting performances of our generation.
0790743213|4.0|North by Northwest is very exciting and suspensfull movie. Throughtout the whole entire movie it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen next to Roger Thornhill. I'm not one for old fashion movies but this one I would deffinately recommend to anyone who enjoys a good suspensfull movie. It kind of reminded me of I Know What You Did Last Summer, but in an older sense. The movie itself starts out with a man named Roger Thornhill who gets kidnapped from an important dinner meeting. Roger is taken to a secluded house where these man are calling him by the name of George Kaplin. They refuse to believe him of his true name they get him drunk and put him in a stolen car and try to drive him off of a cliff. Roger came to just as the car was going over and lead the killers on a chase throughout the town. Roger is stopped by the police and taken to jail for being drunk and for stealing a car. The police find his story a lie. The next day Roger and his mother went with some detectives to that sane house and the woman there just made up a lie that she had a party and Roger left was there and left drunk. He was so furious that he then went on a chase to find this George Kaplin fellow to whom he supposedly resembled. On his journey he runs into many people and many more problems. He also gets considered a murderer when a man he is talking to gets stabbed with a knife. While on his journey he runs into a woman named Eve. She seems very nice and even helps Roger out even though she knows what he is really considered. She lies to protect him from the police. Later in the movie you will find what Eve's real position is in the situation. Roger falls in love with Eve and keeps tracking her down all the way to the end of the movie where he ends up saving her. Eve acts as though she wants to help Roger but in reality she is trying to help the killers get him. In the end it ends up that Eve works for the F.B.I. and she is their secrete tip on to what is going on with Vandam's deals.The whole time that Roger is running from the police the F.B.I. is following him and Eve. Which leads them to catching Vandam and his men. In my opinion the ending of the movie was dumb but I guess if you look at the ways movies used to end that was what the people wanted to see. For those people that like to have happy endings at the end of all movies this is a good one for you but even if you don't like happy endings the suspense to the end is enough to keeping you watching. I enjoyed this movie overall and I hope that you have too or else you will enjoy it in the near future.

B000001FDG|5.0|This debut Eric Clapton has some blues rock but deviates into other styles.  Easy Now is one pretty acoustic ballad and Eric gives one of his best vocal performances.  The lyrics are pretty hip with the time it was recorded too.  The female background vocalists add a special touch on several tracks most notably Lonesome andBottle Of Red Wine.  However the real meat and potatoes songs are Blues Power, Bad Boy, After Midnight, and Let It Rain.  They really rock with a passion as Eric's vocals really touch the soul.  Do not overlook this recording.
B0000508U6|5.0|having owned this cd for a whopping eleven days and having listened to it just about that many times, i'm going to be candid and say it's just about the best i've heard from this genre. not that i've heard much, oh no, but radiohead and travis just...don't quite do as much for me as does coldplay. the latter tends to stick itself into my head more often.<br />today i ventured into a small music shop, my sister in search of a flute and myself in search of a guitar pick (easily found). i heard one of the employees humming a slightly familiar tune. soon the following words began to go with it: &quot;inside a bubble...&quot;<br />et voila, i rest my case. it's infectious.
B000008GEF|4.0|Whereas this recording did not grab the commercial public as heavy as All Things Must Pass, it is still very good music wise.  The lyrics really touch you deep down in the soul.  George also proves to be in fine voice and his guitar is quite smooth especially on the opening track.  The second side is a little slow but when one is feeling introspective it too can be quite pleasing.  I give this one my two thumbs up!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a wonderful Cd. Every great Beatles song is on this disc. It is just absoulutley great to listen to. If you love the Beatles this is a must, all the best are on one dic.
B000002I25|5.0|As an avid doors fan, I feel this first album of The Doors is their greatest. I think it stands as one of the best debut albums ever recorded, showing The Doors at their best. This was the groups attempt at &quot;breaking through&quot; to the otherside lyrically and musically. Morrison croons and sings you into an almost trance and then explodes with primal screams and yells the next. I think &quot;Light My Fire&quot; is a hypnotic masterpiece of flowing rythms and sounds. Morrison hated this song however because of the frequent radio play and the chants of &quot;play light my fire&quot; at concerts. I still feel the best song on the album is &quot;The End.&quot; I would recomend turning out the lights and putting on a pair of headphones while you listen to this eleven minute epic. It takes you on a journey of the senses and will mezmorize you. Towards the end of the journey, the sharp and booming organ chords wake you up and then Morrison proceeds to tell you &quot;this is the end.&quot; In Conclusion, check this album out.

B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna has been a driving force in the music industry for going on twenty years, thats saying alot.  Most artist have one catchy song here and there but Madonna is constant with her work.  While she is always on the cutting edge, she always lets her fans know that she is thinking about them by performing jewels like Music and Don't Tell Me.  Anyone who has anyting bad to say M is just plain jelous.  Music is a very strong album and even when it slows down there is plenty of warmth and feeling there.  Ending the album with the song Gone is very wise, listen close it is almost spirtual.  Another winner for M.

B00000BKDV|4.0|Following the success of &quot;The Number Of The Beast&quot;, Iron Maiden hired Nicko McBrain as their new drummer and their classic line-up was formed. With songs like &quot;The Trooper&quot;, &quot;Flight Of Icarus&quot;, &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, and &quot;Revelations&quot; this is a Maiden classic. &quot;Revelations&quot; starts with nice guitar but transforms into a great riff. &quot;Flight Of Icarus&quot; is a fabulous epic that could not be improved. &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; is also a favorite that has a great opening percussion. &quot;The Trooper&quot; is the best song and is a classic. &quot;The Trooper&quot; is about going to war. In conclusion, this is a great Maiden album.
6300271285|5.0|And that's NOT an under-statment on my part. Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, and Steve Martin were great in this film, and made me watch it again and again! Skid Row (Downtown), Dentist!, Feed Me (Git It), The Meek Shall Inherit (Though I perfer the un-cut version), and Mean Green Mother From Outer Space were great, and the special effects were wonderful. A great movie for it's time!<br />Little Shop of Horrors (Also called LSH or LSOH for short) was a great film. It's about an evil, man eating plant from outer space who has set his goals on taking over the world. (Or eating it, to be exact.) Audrey 2, the plant, starts out by being a seemingly harmless plant that just so happens to show up at the &quot;Old Chinese Man&quot;'s store after the total eclipse of the sun. When Seymour is picking up a bundle of roses down where he lives, cuts his finger and begins sucking the blood from it. Audrey 2 notices, and begins making sucking noises. From then on this plant feeds on human blood, ranging from a sadistic dentist, to the nearly-harmless Skid Row flower shop owner.<br />This movie will keep you in stiches from beginning to end, with great preformances from Rick Moranis as Seymour, Ellen Greene taking back up her part from stage as Audrey, Steve Martin as the sadist dentist, Orin Scrivello D.D.S, who is Audrey's boyfriend who sports leather and a motorcycle, and Vincent Gardenia as Mushnik.
B00000JPHE|3.0|I understand that this version came out before Frank Langella's version, but in all honesty, this version comes nowhere near Frank Langella's. On one hand, the scenery is well done. Lugosi performs the role with some dignity, and the effects are well done. The story moves at a good pace, and as classic Black and White horror goes, this movie does a fairly decent job. But those are the only good things I can really say about this movie. Lugosi does not have Langella's malignant charm. I understand that Langella reused some of Lugosi's lines, but Langella put much more life, drama, and intensity into the same lines. The heroes do not have the superb, delicate, and exquisite interaction of Olivier, Eve, and Pleasence. I understand that it may not be fair to compare this earlier Abraham to Laurence Olivier, but in all honesty, he does not even come close to Laurence Olivier's superb and unsurpassed portrayal of Abraham. In this version, Abraham is not driven to discovering Dracula's identity by the death of his beloved daughter. Unlike Langella's version, there are no intimate moments drawn with shadows. Also, this version lacks the unsurpassed combination of drama, suspense, subtle humor, and pure terror. The end is nowhere near as intense and terrifying. This may be the classic version, and it probably is wrong to ignore it, but if you ask me, Frank Langella and Laurence Olivier beat this by a long shot.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I got this album for Christmas and can't stop listening to it. I was initially drawn into the sad but powerfully beautiful &quot;exit music&quot;, which, along with the driving &quot;let down&quot;, and the ever-so-slightly funky &quot;karma police&quot; are the &quot;catchiest&quot; songs on the album. The other songs require more time to absorb. But it's well worth the time. &quot;paranoid android&quot; is musically schizophrenic, but successfully conveys a feeling of alientation. &quot;lucky&quot; has become my favorite; it's simply one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It is a strange love song; Yorke cries out for help, yet somehow he is the superhero. Overall, the album is mesmerizingly creepy (sorry, couldn't resist, but it's true), intentionally cold and impersonal. But radiohead do not leave us feeling hopeless with &quot;lucky&quot; and also with &quot;the tourist&quot;, where, for the first time, and the end of the album, Yorke speaks directly and compassionately to his audience. So if you like to think and aren't afraid to feel, I highly recommend this album.
B00003W8NM|5.0|When a friend told me that this was by far the best movie he had ever seen, I was quite skeptical.  Not usually likeing movies brimming with pointless violence, I decided to go to my local Blockbuster and rent the DVD.  Let's just say I was pleasantly shcoked.  The underlying social commentary in this brilliantly written story/movie was truly fascinating and captivating.  I was presented with ideas rarely presented in any artistic genre and shocked that they were in this or any film.  I found a great mix of humor, action, and creativity.  I have since become a great fan of this work and others by the author of the book.  This was an amazing film and the DVD was great because of all of the extra stuff on the second disc.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone, anytime.
B000002AVF|5.0|Daydream was a breakthrough in many ways. It changed music. It spun off three #1 hits and sold millions worldwide, proving to be one of Mariah's most successful albums to date. Fantasy is just one of those songs you just have to sing along with whenever you hear it, same thing with Always Be My Baby. These are classic R&amp;B songs that only Mariah can deliver. Other mentionable songs on here include the dreamy ballads Underneath The Stars, When I Saw You, Forever, the anthems I Am Free, One Sweet Day (with Boyz II Men) and Looking In, the midtempo Melt Away and more. This is a must have for any music lover.
B00003CXE7|5.0|As a student of the classics, not only did I find this film an accurate depiction of the Roman empire and its times, but I also enjoyed it immensely.  It appeals to those of us who are not great fans of action films without its wonderful plot, excellent directing, and just overall beauty in filmmaking.  Additionally, the DVD enhances the picture and the sound.  The extras on the second disc are wonderful.  Just a great film all around.  I highly recommend this film to anyone.
B0000028VT|5.0|Music Box is one of Mariah's best albums in my opinion, along with Butterfly and Daydream. The album is heavily ballad driven, but that does not faze the album one bit. The album goes uptempo a few times, Dreamlover the lead single which hit #1 almost right after release, Now That I Know and I've Been Thinking About You. The ballads are breathtaking, from the anthem second single Hero which also hit #1, to the friendship anthem Anytime You Need A Friend. Never Forget You and Without You are wonderful classics as well, and the album closer All I've Ever Wanted is a dreamy lovely ballad. However the standout to me on the album is the title track, which was so deserving to be a single but never was, one of her best songs ever. I highly reccomend this album to anyone who likes really good music.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|This is a fantastic album which combines many forms of music - r&amp;b, pop, latin, hip hop... - the list goes on and on. From the very first track I was hooked. Lopez prooves that she can sing as well as act and this album is living proof. Tracks like 'Let's Get Loud', 'Waiting For Tonight', 'Open Off My Love', and 'It's Not That Serious' are instant favourites, while 'If You Had My Love', It's Too Late' and 'Talk About Us' are also excellent. I'd definately recommend it to anyone - I can't stop listening to it!
B000000WF0|5.0|Ever experienced pain and wanted to die but then was saved by the beauty of nature? Ever get the feeling nothing could kill you? Ever wanted to scream the love you feel? &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; is perhaps the most emotionally passionate album since &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; by U2. Anyone who enjoys having a metaphysical change from music, must own &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. This album is like experiencing a good performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; or undergoing a transformational change. I can think of few albums that made me feel this way in the 90's. <br />The music goes from all different moods and depths. From the lightly strummed acoustic ballad &quot;Sonnet&quot; to the chaotic, thunder storm guitars at the end of the album on &quot;Come On.&quot; The production is perfect. If you study and listen to songs like &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; carefully, you can hear different layers of sound and perfection. Few bands can give us such a variety of sounds and yet still keep the same mood and feelings. &quot;Come On&quot; is just as beautiful as &quot;Lucky Man&quot; is. My personal favorite is &quot;Space &amp; Time&quot; on this album. Many bands like Embrace after &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; was a hit, tried to copy The Verve's style but can't even come close.<br />The lyrics are some of most beautiful prose to come out of England since romantic poets like Keats. The lyrics have a touch of many authors, everything from the beauty of Shakespeare's Sonnets to the hellish world of Dante. All the lyrics have a theme around becoming aware with one's self and going through some kind of spiritual change. Richard Ashcroft writes and sings from the soul. He is one of the greatest songwriters of our time. I guarantee you after you buy this album, you'll be quoting the lyrics every where you go.<br />I could go and on about this album but I think you should put this item in your Cart now and find out for yourself just how amazing it is. Of course if you're a nihilist you'll hate it but for everyone else they are the Hymns of our time.
B00003CXFU|5.0|What makes this film even better is knowing that it's a true story.  Julia Roberts again delivers an outstanding performance in Erin Brockovich.  An interesting plot that touches your heart.  Rent or buy this movie, it will have you laughing and cheering for Erin and all of her clients the whole way through!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This CD is awesome. Serious hardcore music. ATDI remind me of Rage Against the machine, but with so much ENERGY! Buy this CD, its cheap, cool, and just something good to listen to.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|Savage Garden is an awesome group. I've liked them since they released their debut album. Even though I like their previous album a bit better, this one is still great. Affirmation has excellent hits such as Crash And Burn, Affirmation, I Knew I Loved You, and so many more. Darren, the lead singer, has an amazing voice. Daniels insturments add a melodic sound to the music. This album is more serious than their first, full of love songs, and heartbreakers. Overall, this is a great album and you should get it if you are a fan of the group.
B000051VWW|5.0|THIS CD IS AWSOME...SHE HASSO MCH EMOTION AND RYTHIM...EVERY SONG HAS A STORY TO TELL...AND SHE DELIVERS EVERY NOTE WITH PASSION..SADE HAS MADE THE BEST SO FAR....BUY THIS CD AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!! RYAN..WISCONSIN.
B000001IQH|5.0|I propose a new name for this amazing cd- Energy 2.  Or maybe we should rename Operation Ivy's Energy to ....And out come the wolves 2.  I dunno.  One thing that I do know is that this is my all time favorite punk album.  It is simply amazing.  There isn't one bad song on this great cd.  It is Rancid's best, easily the best.  Anyone who is looking to get started with Rancid, don't even think about getting any other cd.  If you like punk, get this album.  If you don't like punk, get this album.  If you like any type of music at all, get this album.  In fact, even if you don't like music at all, get this album, and it easily change your mind.  Best 3 albums of all time- ...And Out Come the Wolves by Rancid.  Energy by Operation Ivy, and Losing Streak by Less Than Jake.  I can't tell you enough, buy this album, it is way better than the new one!
B000050FEN|5.0|First off, this movie had all the specifications in order to make a great film.  The sound for example, if you are operating from a receiver with 5.1/2.0/7.1/2.1/6.1 speaker sound, you will truly enjoy this movie.  The acting is excellent, also with this edition, many extra things come out of it, so basically it is a very valuable/watch twice dvd.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I thought that Jennifer Lopez was very emotional. She deeply express her feelings into all her songs. Although I'm not Latino, I feel that she is a great influence to all Latino's in the world. The main song that I was feelings was &quot; Should've Never&quot;. I thought the song was beautiful! It reminds me of the past relationships I been in! I also think every movie she played in was great. I think Jennifer Lopez deserve support, because she struggle to become what she is now. I admire her because she teaches all that you should never stop trying to become what you want to be! I thank you Jennifer! Because I'm working on my singing skills and I'm writing! To everyone, stop hating on her! She's just a Latino woman who is trying to do her thing!
B00004YA66|5.0|The two best movies of 2000 were, coincidentally, the ones that received the most mixed reviews by their audience. Besides wonderfully acted and directed screenplays, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; and &quot;Frequency&quot; don't have too much in common, but they both demand that the audience pay attention and follow the story. I think that is why you see a few negative reviews on this site and others, and I am incredibly disheartened by what they have to say. <br />&quot;We all know that time travel is not possible....&quot;- one review says. Well actually it IS theoretically possible, but that is not the point. More than that, though, if you are that much of a skeptic, why are you seeing a movie about a man who is able to communicate with his father, who has been dead for 30 years? You know going in that this is a Science Fiction/Fantasy movie, in the spirit of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;. Sheesh. <br />As for the DVD itself, I just bought it and I have to say that I love it. New Line went all out on this one, providing commentary by the director and actors, as well as a neat little &quot;science behind the movie&quot; segment. It was really interesting to see how this wonderful movie was put together. I honestly believe that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one you cannot pass by. Get it today!
6300214044|5.0|Ignore any of the criticism you may have heard of this film--that it employs voyeuristic exploitation, that it's overly sentimental, that it represents an early, less-advanced stage in the career of a brilliant filmmaker, David Lynch.  The simple truth of the matter is that anyone might have great difficulty naming a single film made since 1980 that represents so complete a mastery of the medium.<br />Despite much received wisdom proclaiming that film is limited to the external surfaces of reality, Lynch employs camera work, editing, and sound to conduct us deep into the innermost consciousness of John Merrick (the historic &quot;elephant man&quot;).  That which produces revulsion at the initial recording of its grotesque, nauseating features (this is no moderately attractive human specimen such as the one  in &quot;Mask&quot;) ultimately evokes sympathy, understanding, and love of the inextinguishable human spirit itself.<br />Lynch organizes the film around 3 challenging montage sequences--the opening one presents the birth of Merrick into a world of uncertainty and contradictions; the second takes us into the world of Merrick's living hell, with industrial smoke replacing the white clouds of the opening sequence; the 3rd is accomplished through a panning of the camera that seamlessly unites physical and metaphysical orders in its presentation of Merrick's sleep, thus resolving the conflicts in the first 2 sequences.<br />The film has minimal dialogue and only a fragmentary musical score, yet it represents one of the most imaginative, at once disturbing and intriguing, uses of sound in the history of cinema.  Perhaps only a well-produced DVD can fully disclose the &quot;sound of silence&quot; that characterizes both Merrick's inner and outer worlds, yet the subtle changes in audio ambience, together with the subliminal &quot;pounding&quot; that frequently reminds us of a dehumanized world, should be unmistakable even on VHS and low-fidelity equipment.<br />Finally, the acting is in perfect harmony with the filmmaker's purposes.  No individual &quot;sticks out.&quot;  Heard's simple yet sympathetic Merrick, Anthony Hopkins' beautifully understated Dr. Treves, the supporting roles of Gielgud, Bancroft, and Wendy Hiller--all contribute to a sum so much greater than its parts as to defy description.  To say that this is one of the most underrated films ever made may be the biggest understatement one could ever make., the acting is in perfect harmony with the filmmaker's purposes.  No individual &quot;sticks out.&quot;  Heard's simple yet sympathetic Merrick, Anthony Hopkins' beautifully understated Dr. Treves, the supporting roles of Gielgud, Bancroft, and Wendy Hiller--all contribute to a sum so much greater than its parts as to defy description.  To say that this is one of the most underrated films ever made may be the biggest understatement one could ever make.
0399146253|2.0|The best and most hopeful thing about The Last Precinct is that there's a suggestion that Kay, Lucy, and Marino may finally be freed from the psychological death spiral they've been in for about the last five books. Like most other reviewers here, I've been a fan of Cornwell and her creation Kay since Post Mortem, but I've been more discouraged with every installment since From Potter's Field.  The plots have become MUCH too personally centered on Kay, suggesting some conceit on Cornwell's part:  think about it, every man is in love with Kay, nearly every man in an authority position has it in for her, every psychopath is obsessed with her.<br />But back to The Last Precinct.  Pretty much an expansion of Black Notice, but luckily with some clarification of details that simply didn't ring true at the time, like Kay sleeping with Jay Talley. Unfortunately, Cornwell can't seem to let go of some things, and Benton's murder gets murkier every time there's a new element exposed.  It's time for some new territory and I hope I saw the springboard for that in this outing.  I'm sick of hearing about Temple Gault, Carrie Grethen, and even poor old Benton. Let these people rest in peace and find some new ground to cover!<br />That said, I continue to hope for some kind of resurrection of the old Kay in the next novel.
0486227073|4.0|Even though Bridgman's anatomy books have been around for a while, I haven't seen anything better yet. This and his other books helped me tremendously. Keep in mind that these series are not a step by step instructions, they are schematics that you must study and draw at every possible angle and preferably use it as a reference for real figure drawing classes.<br />The illustrations are somewhat badly printed and hard to make out at times but it's still very helpful especially for the price of these books.<br />Four stars because of poor print quality.
6303212379|5.0|I am 18 and I first saw this movie when I was 3 and me and my boys still watch this movie at least every other week.  I know this movie from Title Screen to the Credits and it is my all time favorite I reccomend this to anybody.
B00004X01U|5.0|WOW!!!!! As someone who's just been adopted as a permanent fanatic of Madonna, i must say i'm very impressed with MUSIC.  I've managed to listen to all but track 9 (Paradise).  It's just too long and her computer manipulated voice began to nag.  Music is just something u have to start dancing to...very simple but that's the way we like it.  Impressive instant had me laughing with singy singy singy like the bird wingy wingy wingy....but it's one hell of a disco song.  ONe of my personal faves is runaway lover, reminiscent of techno funk beautiful stranger.  I deserve it is easy on the ears.  Amazing reminds me again of Beautiful stranger, very catchy and her voice just rocks the dance floor.  Skipping to my favorite song in the entire album, Dont tell me: just easy to listen to and no frills.  The video helps elevate the song to an entirely new level.  I love listening to it everytime and it has to be one of the best madonna songs ever.  What it feels to be a girl is fun and, coming from a guys perspective, quite intriguing.  What is it like to be girl?  Gone is a nice touch but some of the high pitched, annoying beeping techno keyboard notes stain this otherwise simple ballad.  If I had heard less of the techno in the guitar tracks, they would have been immaculate.  About 8of the 10 songs can be hit singles.  Hope atleast I see Runaway lover and Amazing with videos
6304383177|4.0|There's something appealing about Ms. Hepburn -- the epitome of beauty, grace, and intelligence -- and Mr. Grant -- um, ditto -- falling down and acting like goons.  Watch Kate simultaneously serenade a leopard on a roof while trying to convince a psychiatrist that she hasn't lost her marbles.  And check Cary out, dressed in a negligée, making goofy faces at George the dog.  Those are their individual moments to shine.  When together, they are magic.  It hardly matters at all that the plot of \\"Baby\\" is nonsensical and ridiculous.  I think that's the point.  What matters most is that Kate and Cary have picture perfect comedy timing together.  I'll admit that I enjoyed this teaming (plus Mr. Stewart) more in \\"The Philadelphia Story\\", where the verbal wit was the main source for the comedy.  But the running around like headless chickens here is less about social commentary, than about two idiots getting themselves in bizarre situations and ultimately falling in love.<br />The amazing thing to me, looking back on the film, is that most of the gags can be seen from miles away.  When the leopard is locked in the stable, do you really think it will stay there for the remainder of the flick?  When Kate laughs at Cary, having just fallen down a ridge himself, do you think she's long for standing on that perch?  And the brontosaurus skeleton we meet in the opening scene, well, I think we all see where that one's going.  Maybe it's a function of countless screwball comedies using this as a template over the last 60 odd years; the jokes have become cliched and overused.  It's refreshing sometimes to go back to the source (or at least the best of the sources) to see where the jokes came from.  And that they hold up.
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|Now here's a clever idea, a parody of a satire.  \\"Scary Movie\\" spends most of its time lampooning \\"Scream\\" which was a tongue in cheek satire of horror flicks.  It also takes pot shots at various other successful horror flicks such as \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" and \\"Blair Witch Project\\".  Unfortunately, this film's cleverness is overshadowed by its bad taste.<br />This is a Wayans home movie, written by Shawn and Marlon and directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans.  There really isn't any story, just a succession of ribald skits based sometimes verbatim on various horror flicks.  In actuality, this is more of a raunchy sex farce than a horror movie.  It has a puerile sexual obsession throwing as much bawdiness as possible into every scene.  The jokes are crass and vulgar guttersnipe humor.  This is sledgehammer comedy, with everything bluntly stated and no subtlety whatever.  Though the slapstick is funny, even hilarious at times, there are so many tastelessly offensive lines that the net result is negative.  The Wayans take political incorrectness to an ugly extreme, taking the liberty of mocking just about every group possible with exaggerated stereotypes.<br />The acting is nothing special except for Dave Sheridan as Sheriff Doofy who is worth the price of admission.  The direction is also mundane.  I must give the Wayans brothers credit for knowing their audience.  This film is clearly targeted at the 18 to 25 demographic (in reality probably 14 to 25) and panders mercilessly to their fixations (sex, drugs and sex).  It is likely to offend the sensibilities of a large number of people, but after grossing more than $150 million at the box office, the Wayans brothers can shrug that off as irrelevant (a sequel is already in the works).<br />As I watched this film, I laughed hysterically in some parts and I was revolted by others.  However, since the good is outweighed by the bad, I rated it a 4/10.  Add one point for every year of age under 25.  Those who are offended by foul sexual humor should steer clear.
B00004Z459|5.0|Whenever you get a CD, you listen all the way through and pick out your favorite songs, and the songs you don't want to ever listen to again. This is one of my only CD's I can listen to all the way through without skipping tracks. It's solid heavy metal, it's clean, and it talks about issues and problems all teens are faced with. It's a 5-star album that will put this band at the top. I can't list my favorite songs, I like them all. The guitar parts are really original, and the percussion really makes the songs worth listening to. It's also really cool how they have background vocals, I get sick of listening to one person do all vocals. Get this CD, you won't regret it!
0790729725|3.0|A movie this great deserves a special edition DVD with more than a couple of trailers.  Plus, you have to turn the DVD over at a certain point in the movie.  I would wait for the re-issue, becase I'm sure that's gotta be in the works.  Hopefully they have plans for all Scorsese movies.  All the DVD's are bad, with the exception of the special edition of Taxi Driver.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator chronicles the story of Maximus, a Roman general that serves Rome itself, and not merely the person holding the reins of the great empire. The story is an epic tale that reminds me of the great classic, Ben Hur. True, this movie, reminds me of the modern films, the Patriot and Braveheart, this one surpasses both of these in both story telling and action.<br />While the scenes are at times a little bloody, it is done tastefully, and it does not remind me of some of the gore fests that I have seen. I feel that this story although not totally original, is a very compelling and stirs one's emotions. Maximus is a reluctant hero, and merely wants to be left alone, but his wrath is provoked by the son of one whom he trusted, and he is unjustly dishonored. Through valor and his own abilities, he survives as a gladiator until one day his skill and ability puts him in a position to gain both vengeance and an assured future for Rome.<br />Masterfully directed by Ridley Scott and wonderful acting by those in the movie will make this a classic that will endure as has the classic that this reminds me of, Ben Hur. I would heartily recommend this to all except the most squeamish. This would be a great part of any DVD collection.
0312243022|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I didn't want to read it-- I was frankly in a modern interpretation of Virginia Woolf. She is one of my favorite writers and not someone that I trust another writer to touch and not distort. In the end, I read it for my book club. I did Cunningham a major disservice with my suspicion, because this book is both a worthy homage to Woolf and a moving novel in its own right.<br /><br />_The Hours_ weaves together the lives of different women, illuminating the threads that link suicide, artistry, and failure. These links are made even stronger by the resonances between this book and _Mrs. Dalloway_. (I believe you can read this without having read _Mrs. Dalloway_, by the way. It should stand on its own without problem.)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0000027I6|4.0|After two dismal solo outings and an even worse live version of The Wall, Roger Waters finally has something to be proud of outside his work  with Pink Floyd.  Amused To Death never steps wrong from the atmospheric opening &quot;The Ballad Of Bill Hubbard&quot; to the emotional final and title track, &quot;Amused To Death&quot;.  Highlights are &quot;What God Wants Pt 1&quot;, &quot;The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range&quot;, and &quot;Amused To Death&quot;.  This is not to say the other tracks are bad.  Jeff Beck's guitar contribution make up for the absence of Dave Gilmour. If you are a Pink Floyd fan, this CD fits nicely with Dark Side Of The Moon and The Wall.
6305807086|1.0|This movie became excrutiatingly boring after about 20 mins.  I did like JM himself, but couldn't shake the feeling that he was doing to flick to show that he can laugh at himself.  The old boy has been doing of lot of serious roles recently...<br />Overall the characters weren't very sympatheic and the idea wasn't that mind-blowing.  Interesting, sure, but it didn't make me think &quot;I wish I'd thought of that for a story.&quot;  It's a one-hitter, a shelf-piece.  In short - a rental.
B000002B30|3.0|Although many of Bruce's greatest songs are represented here, many key songs were left out. This record focuses on Bruce's 'Born in the USA' and leaves out songs from 'Greetings' and 'E Street Shuffle.' How can you have a Bruce compilation without 'Rosalita'?  Despite its obvious flaws, the first side of 'Greatest Hits' is worth a listen. Unfortunately it slows down at the end with the addition of some new songs, none of which are worthy of the title 'Greatest Hits'. This is not for the hardcore fan, but would be a good buy for people just beginning to be interested in Bruce.
B00003CXDG|4.0|This movie, while not living up to the first, was still a visual and auditory treat. The movie, while having very little in the way of new plot elements had many fantastic (albeit, totally unbelievable) stunt sequences. The movie is not a serious movie, and thus this detracts only slightly from the story. The story although not really all that original seems to flow along well.<br />I watched the movie to escape reality for a couple of hours, and it was a pleasant diversion from the real world. The characters seemed to be well acted, the performers were easy on the eyes, and the environment was so far fetched that it was unrealistic. The perfect keys to a good escapist movie.<br />The stunts while not really all that realistic, were dazzling and contributed to the aesthetic quality of the movie.<br />Overall 4 stars Aesthetics 5 stars Acting 5 stars Action 4 stars, due to a lack of really original sequences Stunts 5 stars Story 3 stars Believability 2 stars<br />All in all this is a pretty good movie, but you have to have a really good imagination to think that any of the story is plausible and/or possible. I would only recommend this to those who are major fans of John Woo and/or are looking for a good movie to escape reality with.
B00000K19E|2.0|This movie has exactly two things to recommend it:<BR> 1. Cool special effects.<BR> 2. Foetus farms.<br /><br />Other than that, this movie is utter trash.  Those of you who don't want your virgin eyes spoiled by knowing what the movie is about (like anyone doesn't know by now) should not read what follows, because it is a long list of everything WRONG with the movie--not counting the fact that the (supposedly mind-blowingly original) concept behind it has been done by countless sci-fi movies and books for decades--and I may accidentally drop a few hints as to the nature of the plot of this, um, flick.<br /><br />1. The Oracle.  It's stupid, it makes no sense, and it has nothing to do with anything.<BR> 2. The fact that Neo comes back to life when Trinity kisses him.  I mean, come ON, can't we think of anything cleverer than THAT?<BR> 3. The idea of getting energy from humans, forgetting the fact that you'd have to put more energy into them than you'd get out.<BR> 4. Beings that control all aspects of your perception using fallible, killable agents that (mostly) obey the laws of physics, when they could just make you think an anvil fell on your head and crushed you.<BR> 5. The fact that unplugging someone causes them to die, rather than simply to come out of the matrix.  Isn't that what happened to Neo when he took the pill anyway?<BR> 6. Telephones. This was the most irritating thing in the entire movie.  WHY, may I ask, is it necessary to pick up a telephone to emerge from this virtual universe?<BR> 7. If deja vu is when there's a glitch and &quot;they&quot; reset something, shouldn't everyone get it at the same time?<BR> 8. The ripply-helicopter-building-crash thing.  Some people explain this by saying that &quot;they&quot; don't know how to deal with disasters of that magnitude, but what about volcanoes, earthquakes, etc.?<BR> 9. All the stupid Biblical metaphors and whatnot.  They really don't make that much sense once you analyze them.<br /><br />So there youhave it.  On the one hand, you have the red pill--logic, reason, internal consistency, intellectual value.  On the other, you have the blue pill--foetus farms. Which do you choose?
B0000025ZF|1.0|After a brilliant career with Pink Floyd, The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, the first solo album from Roger Waters,  is a major let down.  With the exception of the song, &quot;Every Stranger's Eyes&quot;, this CD is totally forgettable.  Not even Eric Clapton's guitar work can save this.  Even the melodies are a rip off.  The melody from &quot;In The Flesh&quot; is present during several of the albums tracks.  If you are a Roger Waters fanatic, go ahead.  Everyone else steer clear.
B0000558LN|5.0|PIPER PERABO WAS AN EXCELLENT ACTRESSSO WAS LEANN RIMES AND THE OTHER LADIES AT THE BAR.
B000000FG8|5.0|I first heard this cd when my brother got it and he thought it was ok but I thought it was among the best cds ever made.  Thanks to this I have purchased the cd unrealeased energy.  Every song on here is perfect and is an anthm for life even a decade later.
6305265666|5.0|Ever After is an excellent tale of romance. It has humor at every turn. It has an excellent story line. The photography is pretty good too. The characters are memorable. I like Anna and the King a little better, but Ever After still has a five star rating. See this movie and enjoy.
B00004TDTO|5.0|There really isn't much about the movie that I could tell you because I doubt if there is anyone that hasn't seen it already.<br />What I can tell you is that this DVD is excellent!  The picture and sound quality is amazing with numerous scenes that were omitted from the original VHS versions.  The added goodies to this disc is almost worth the purchase price on their own.<br />The &quot;Making Of&quot; is very interesting and with interviews from most of the people involved gives it the added touch.  In all the package claims 75 minutes of additional footage.<br />I highly recommend this title as a must have for anyone interested in movies.  If you are like me, this will be one of your favorite shows.
630575067X|5.0|I am tired of the crticism that this movie has been receiving.  If you are a true Star Wars fan you would like this movie.  The film is explaining all things that will happen in the future movies.  The prequels are setting the stage for the episodes 4-6.  I love the way the story is coming together.  Roger Ebert gave this movie 3 and a half star, the reason people are so hard on this movie is because they expect a remake of the original Star Wars, if this movie was showed in 1977 it would be hailed a visionary.  If you watch this movie and absorb it you will understand a lot more things about the Star Wars saga.  Darth Maul also was a very good villian.  If you do not like this movie you are not a true fan.
B000000WFU|5.0|I first heard a hint of Adiemus a few years ago at a friend's house.  From the first track I was hooked!  I have introduced it to several of my friends and they have said the same thing, that hearing just some of it is enough to get your attention.  And then after that, you're hooked.  And any of these &quot;collections&quot; of similar types of music where they give you a track or two are not really doing justice to the work.  The recording needs to be taken as a whole like any great symphony or body of work.  Listen to it as a whole and tell me when you're finished that you don't want more!  I challenge you.  Miriam Stockley's vocals are both stirring and inspiring.  The themes and melodies get into your soul and become a part of you.  Shortly after buying &quot;Songs of Sanctuary,&quot; I bought &quot;Cantata Mundi,&quot; which where &quot;Santuary&quot; is contemplative and introspective, &quot;Cantata&quot; is more dramatic!  It takes you away to places you've only visited in your mind!  Adiemus III, &quot;Dances of Time&quot; is a wonderful homage to world dance styles with the Adiemus twist and is pure fun.  I too have listened to all three of them repeatedly and have never tired of them.  If it is possible to be addicted to music, these recordings will do it for you!  I can't wait for Adiemus IV if it is even in the works.
B00003CWLF|5.0|This movie has everything a good movie requires. It has a story, plot, action, good character development, excellent photography, emotion. My dad says this movie might be more true to the history of Thailand(Siam back then) than the musical. But most of you say the romance part never happened. Anyway, I love this movie. This movie is more action packed than Ever After(Another good movie from same director). The photography is superb. I first saw it when I rented it on VHS. I on the DVD version of it. I give the DVD 3&amp;1/2 stars. The extras are okay, I like the making of Anna and the King. The music video is okay. Other than that the extras aren't all they could be. But the DVD offers the best thing it could have on it, the movie. Rent it or buy it, and Enjoy. You will not be dissapointed.
B00000DFKF|4.0|it is a strong black metal with an unique sound. I recommand this album to all the fans.
B00004XONN|4.0|The first listen may put some off. After the first listen for a while, I skipped to National Anthem, Optmistic and Motion Picture Soundtrack. Then I listened to it again Then, it became clear. A lot of the songs may sound very similiar to the less pop orientated techno-dance-trance type going around ( Some smacks of Pop Will Eat Itself aswell ) , but it still sounds like Radiohead, and its still good. Many bands find it very difficult to follow a good album, so following OK Computer Kid A will always seem &quot;not-as-good&quot;. This is a shame, since there is a lot of atmosphere to it, more of general suffocation than of the mortal fear of OK Computer. <br />I wouldn't say it was a classic, because it isn't. Die hard fans will love it, and since no single was released in the UK, it still managed to get to no1 through word of mouth and the net. I didn't even know it existed until I saw it at no 11 in the charts as I was going home from work! :-) However, I love it.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Plain and upfront, I'm a devotee of U2- can't get enough of them, and like a lot of fans out there, I'll pretty much buy whatever they put out, regardless of the buzz.  So what if some of you out there think they've sold out;  isn't that the whole idea behind pop music anyway?  I think they can afford to make whatever &quot;mistakes&quot; that will result in an album such as this one. They are quintessential musicians (whose songwriting ability is on a par with  the Beatles, but that is much more evident on &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind.&quot;)  Not only do they nail it on pulse-pounding techno-rhythms and memorable melodies (with &quot;Discotheque&quot; and &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;), but with lyrics like &quot;If beauty is truth/and surgery the fountain of youth.../&quot; there is some serious depth and thought going into the process. Or maybe Bono wrote it in 5 minutes whilst smoking 20 cigarettes, who knows, but it just solidifies the whole genius thing.
1573221562|4.0|Water's tale of a lonely London spinster and a mysterious spirit medium is a beautiful, compelling visit into a dark yet mesmerizing world of ghosts, lovers, and avid believers in the afterlife.  Her vivid descriptions--from a dank women's prison to a proper Victorian home--are rich in sensory details and poetic prose.  The story is reminiscent of gothic tales of the past, slowly, carefully reeling the reader inside an engrossing and ultimately tragic plot that would have made the Bronte sisters proud.  As a historical fiction writer and amateur researcher of 19th- and 20th-century mediums, I commend Waters on her ability to weave a captivating mystery out of the once-fashionable trend of seances and spiritualism.
6304383827|4.0|Chick flick!  Emma is just another romance movie of two people falling madly in love with each other.  Gwyneth Paltrow plays a typical girl in the movie Emma, directed by Douglas McGrath (I).  Emma Woodhouse (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is a snobby, rich girl who tries to play the town's matchmaker.  Miss Emma holds parties for her single friends and pretends that everyone will fall deeply in love, but never wanting herself to be in that very position of love.  Mr. Knightley, played by Jeremy Northram, tries to keep Miss Emma aware of her selfishness.  Mr. Knightley reminds Miss Emma that she cannot make everyone fall in love; everyone is not always a match made in heaven.  Jeremy Northram is the only person who will stand up to Gwyneth Paltrow and is not afraid to speak his mind.  Miss Emma only sees Mr. Knightley as a friend, he reminds her of a brother.  Soon enough, the brother-sister relationship grows into something more affectionate.   The Director, Doug McGrath (I), does a wonderful job of taking the romance scenes and adding comedy into them.  He makes Emma out to be a rich, snob but she is very witty and quick with her words.   Miss Woodhouse said, &quot;The most beautiful thing in the world is a match well made.&quot;  Emma is the town's matchmaker; therefore, she only sees beauty in putting people in uncomfortable situations and that may conclude in marriage.  Nonetheless, Mr. Knightley always puts her back in reality and tells her that matchmaking is not the most beautiful thing in the world. Gwyneth Paltrow does a beautiful acting job.  Her elegance and grace coincides with her athleticism and wittiness.  Throughout the movie Miss Paltrow is riding horses, shooting a bow and arrow, and dancing.  Her character is always getting into mischief or, usually, she is the cause of it, but somehow using her wittiness she finds a way out of it. Miss Paltrow fits very well into the character of Emma Woodhouse.  The only thing I did not care for was those crazy hairstyles.  It was always curled funny all over the place.  She could have at least neatly made it lay nicely on her head.  Gwyneth Paltrow character was suppose to play one of perfection, not someone with hair all over the place.  It did not work out well with her athleticism, but is did work with Miss Emma's smart comments.  Also, it did not make the rich girl look so elegant.  Her dresses were of elegance, but not her hair.     Overall, I really liked this movie.  It was definitely a chick flick and a romance story.  I think the actors and actresses portrayed the characters very well and did a wonderful job throughout the movie.  Also, the director played a huge role in helping the actors and actresses do such a wonderful job and adding the comedy with the romance.  As for you men, I would definitely stay away from this movie, but the women will love it.
0525945636|4.0|With his latest offering, Ken Follett returns to his Cold War roots with a bang up story full of espionage, intrigue, covert operations, secret agents and the space program thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />A man wakes up in Washington D.C.'s Union Station with a terrible hangover and no memory of how he got there or who he is. A series of close encounters with those interested in his actions show him to be resourceful and even quite dangerous.<br /><br />I couldn't help but think back to THE BOURNE IDENTITY as I read this book. Follett has lifted a lot from Ludlum's masterpiece in this boilerplate tale, but he kept me interested enough to finish the book in two sittings.<br /><br />The first decade of space program and our race to beat Russia is the backdrop for the book's plot and flashbacks to the glory days of life before World War II are used to set up the characters' histories.<br /><br />It's not too hard to figure out who's who, but Follett keeps the plot moving quickly enough to avoid boredom.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00000J6AG|5.0|This effort by activist Moby is a smooth melange of up-tempo, funkified, and clubmix rhythms along with soulful, ethereal harmonies punctuated with percussion and synthesizers.  Whereas other artists may have relied too heavily upon the sampled material, Moby has successfully managed to turn the snippet of melody into a new &quot;found&quot; artwork/song, as one will hear in the twangy backbeat of &quot;Honey&quot; and the techno-esque &quot;Bodyrock&quot;.  Kudos to this ambitious young man.
B00004XONN|3.0|I just bought this album because it was supposed to be something out of the ordinary.  Critics hailed this cd as a masterpeice, so i decided to check it out.  The album has a very dark feel.  The Music, the booklet, everything.  Yet i dont see how this album could be called a masterpiece.  I have listened to it over and over trying to feel Yorke's genius, but just couldnt.  Some songs it sounds as if they are playing with a sound machine.  But I think people praise this CD because it is so out of the ordinary.  I wouldnt reccomend this album to anyone that loves the mainstream, but it is an alright album and does offer a few good tracks.  This is just one weird album.
0316779237|4.0|These Christmas stories really are very unique, and uplifting.  They are a great partner to travel with by plane or train to the family's house for turkey and plumb pudding.  Out of all the stories, the one which gave me the most laughs was the final story &quot;Christmas Means Giving&quot; which shows just how far competition between neighbors 'could' go.  Each story is very well written, and they are so different from one an other.  I certainly want to read more of David Sedaris's short stores, and I hope also he goes the distance and tries to write a full length novel.
0688062334|5.0|I first read this book when I was 13 and I still have a battered paperback copy next to my bed!  Sophie and Howl are my all-time favorite characters!  Mystery, comedy, mistaken identities, magic, and romance all in one.  If you like JK Rowling, read DW Jones and find perfection!
0553106635|4.0|ok i will agree that this book is excellent, lots of good twists, especially with the Stark family. But why is everyone hammering robert jordan here? were not his first three books just as good, if not better? and will GRRM manage to still sell books on his ninth outing? And why are people saying he is better than tolkien as well? get a grip!!<br />Anyway superb book and i can't wait for the next one i just thought i would put my 2p's worth into the martin/jordan arguement!
1881273156|5.0|I thought this book was very insightful. It made me realize that different people show &quot;love&quot; in different ways. Touch, words, acts of service, quality time, and gifts. I have not found my mate yet. But I realize that I love holding hands, and hugs . In order to have my love language met I think it would help to find someone else who has that same need. Then the love language will be easier to compliment.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I was never a Beatles fan before I picked up this album- I had respect for the group but I had never been really interested in the music. I picked up a copy which was on sale and introduced myself to the gods of rock music.  Many people seem to compare the Fab Four to such low-level trash such as the Backstreet Boys and NSync and say that those bands are better- bad news people- The Beatles are actually good. For one- the BSB and NSync don't even write their own music and know nothing about it either- they just sing- whoop-dee-doo. Unlike the immature 10 year old girls who love their BSB and NSync and the immature 10 year old boys who love Godsmack and Slipknot and Deftones, many people know that the Beatles actually knew how to write- and their music has meaning (forwards and backwards...). The album is full of great songs- mostly the picks of the litter in most cases, even though some great songs are left out. I mostly like the later stuff more- but I like to listen to the early stuff when I'm upset.  Some bands think that just because they curse like sailors makes them good- bad news my friends- some people don't like trash. Forget the rest and enjoy the best- Beatles 1
067960085X|5.0|The well-known short novel, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and three of Truman Capote's most famous short stories make for a continually fresh and exciting look at how human beings successfully connect with one another.  No matter how many times you read these stories, you will be moved by Mr. Capote's marvelous sense of and appreciation for the specialness of each life and the ways we belong to each other.  Having not read Breakfast at Tiffany's for about 30 years, I came away much more impressed with the novel than I was the last time I read it.  Perhaps you will have the same reaction upon rereading it as well.  If you are reading it for the first time, you have a very nice surprise ahead of you!<br />Breakfast at Tiffany's revolves around Holly Golightly, the former starlet and cafe society item, who floats lightly through life (like cotton fibers in the wind) looking for where she belongs.  Ms. Golightly is and will remain one of the most original and intriguing characters in American fiction.  Like a magician, she is both more and less than she seems.  But she has an appreciation for people and animals that goes to the core of her soul that will touch you (if you are like me), especially in her desire that they and she be free.<br />The novel has a harder edge and is more revealing about human nature than the movie is.  Of the two, I suggest you start with the novel and graduate to the movie.  You will appreciate the portrayal by Audrey Hepburn of the inner Holly more that way.  The same humor is in both the novel and the movie, as well as the innocent look at life for what it can be, believing in the potential of things to work out for the best.<br />Despite that upbeat note, her weakness is that for all of her ability to understand what motivates other people she does not understand herself well enough to know when she does belong with and to others.  This is symbolized by her abandonment of her unnamed cat, and quick realization that they do belong together.  As for the friends she leaves behind, she never seems to appreciate how much they love her and want to be with her.  As a result, she abandons them as well . . . leaving them with memories to warm their winter nights.<br />Mr. Capote is now realized to have been a more autobiographical writer than was appreciated when he first published his fiction.  Your understanding of Breakfast at Tiffany's will grow if you keep in mind that it was modeled in part on his friendship with Marilyn Monroe.  If you do not know her history, you will find that it closely paralleled Holly's through age 18.<br />The same is true of his short story, &quot;A Christmas Memory.&quot;  I suggest that you read about Mr. Capote's childhood in the recent book, A Southern Haunting of Truman Capote, to fully appreciate the magic of this story.  His &quot;friend&quot; in the story was based on a beloved figure in his young life, who endowed him with a special sense of being loved and appreciated that formed an important foundation for his character and his skill as a writer.  The beautiful devotion that she showed to him is reflected in the loving descriptions he makes of their experiences during their last Christmas together before he was shipped off to military boarding schools at age 8.<br />&quot;A Diamond Guitar&quot; is about the Platonic love of an older man for a younger one in prison.  Like all unrequited love, the older man eventually finds himself embarrassed and exposed.  But the experience remains a touchstone to tender feelings in his heart, and he keeps his young friend's glass-diamond-studded guitar under his bed . . . even though it doesn't sound good when others play it and is becoming shabby with age.<br />&quot;House of Flowers&quot; is a hard look at the vast differences in the ways that women and men view their relationships with one another.  Even when loving, the message seems to be that the men will always take advantage of the women.  The women, however, acquire soulful beautyin their ability to overcome that needy exploitation and appreciate belonging to one another and to the men.<br />This story tells the tale of a young woman who works in a house of ill fame in Haiti, and is charmed into &quot;marrying&quot; a young, poor hill man who is dominated by his spell-casting grandmother.  Together, the young couple overcome the challenge, and build on their love for one another.<br />Budding novelists are sometimes encouraged to study nature closely to draw inspiration.  Although I do not know if Mr. Capote ever received or followed that advice, it is very clear that he retained a childlike ability to see the world as fresh and new every time.  No detail, no nuance, no quirk was too small or unimportant to pass by him or to fail to cast its charm upon him.  Kindly and gently, Mr. Capote takes the reader by the hand and shows what makes these elements so interesting to him.  In this way, the reader's world is expanded, enlightened, and improved.<br />These four stories reverbrate against one another, like the continuing vibrations after a large bell after pealing four times, and create a combined effect beyond what any single story can provide.<br />After you have finished enjoying these stories and the movie, I suggest that you makes some notes about where you belong, who you belong with and to, and what that says about you.  In this way, you can notice important connections that mean a lot to you and others that you may be slighting.  Honor those tendrils in the way that Mr. Capote would if he were writing a story about your life.<br />Notice and touch life intimately and lovingly to find truth and beauty!in their ability to overcome that needy exploitation and appreciate belonging to one another and to the men.<br />This story tells the tale of a young woman who works in a house of ill fame in Haiti, and is charmed into &quot;marrying&quot; a young, poor hill man who is dominated by his spell-casting grandmother.

6304765789|4.0|I just watched this the other night.  I was going to watch 10 minutes, but I got hooked.  I hate movies like this!  They make me crazy!  But it was so good, I couldn't stop watching it.  I had to see how Michael Douglas got out of the Hell he found himself in.  This is one bizarre, complicated film.  I went out to check on my dog during a commercial break and thought she was acting strange.  I wondered if she was in on the &quot;game&quot;.  I actually got alittle paranoid watching this movie. I can't help but think that whoever wrote this screenplay wrote it while experiencing a temporary psychotic break with reality.  It blew my mind.  I was mesmerized, a captive audience, but totally stressed.  I won't even discuss the ending because I can't do it without giving it away.
B000002MJ0|5.0|Combining soft, sometimes almost whispered vocals with loud, bright electric guitar, and having it all mixed together to produce a dense, rhythmic soundscape, My Bloody Valentine (named after a rather cheesy horror flick) invented a kind of &quot;dreampop&quot; subgenre in the late 80s; while the Jesus and Mary Chain were exploring similar territory on their debut &quot;Psychocandy,&quot; and getting more publicity (at least in the States), British/Irish My Bloody Valentine were taking feedback drenched pop to a whole new level. Many claim that &quot;Loveless&quot; is their masterpiece, and I agree that it's a great record in its own right. But I prefer this one, because each song moves me in a slightly different way from each other song here. For instance, I can recall not being able to get the song &quot;Soft as Snow&quot; (But Warm Inside),&quot; the record's opening track, out of my head, nor wanting to, shortly after buying this; I felt, with such music pulsating through my mind/body, as if I were lifting out of myself, and it was an extraordinary experience.<br />It would be no exaggeration to claim that this is one of the greatest records in pop/rock history. Now, if only this amazing band would record some more.
6305603847|4.0|To enjoy this movie, you dont have to do a thing. To understand it's plot, it would be very helpful to buy the album first. This movie is not &quot;the best&quot; movie ever. It is hypnotic, and even provides better versions of some tracks (Mother, with it's music box and dread filled synth). My one complaint. While you will not notice this during the viewing, afterwards you will think of how cool the animation was, and how it stood above the live stuff. The live scenes almost never went as extreme as they could have. Sure, there was blood, rape, hate crimes, but this is not what I mean. I'm talking of Pink Floyd extreme. The animation showcased this wonderfully, and the &quot;Empty Spaces&quot; sequence is almost flawless, with it's famous hammer, screaming head, and who could forget the wall? A good movie, enjoyable, and gives much to think about. I just wish they had worked a little harder.
B00000JZIK|5.0|An exceptional movie.  Basically it starts with the end of the movie and works its way back in flashbacks as Kevin Spacey's character Verbal Kint, relays his story to the investigators.<br />It starts when 5 small time crooks are gathered for a line-up on an arms truck theft.  They note the oddity of their being gathered for this line up, as it is rare they gather all felons for this type of thing,  but go on to consider this fortuitous, as they have a future heist that could use their combined skills. Verbal Kint the least capable of the group is only except after he talks Gabriel Byrne's character Dean Keaton, a former cop and felon, to return to his life of crime.<br />They have some successes which embolden them to go on to some more but wind up realizing their initial pairing up, is not as innocent as it seems.<br />A &quot;mystery&quot; figure in crimes circles Keyser Soze, through a middleman has asked them to do &quot;one final job&quot; with an incredible payoff.  It is very dangerous and not all of them are expected to survive.  Their cooperation is insured by demonstrating what happens when one of them tries to flee.  Additionally, not only they but the people important to them are in this net, to insure their cooperation.<br />I can't provide more details without ruining the story, but it was masterful.  Kevin Spacey's acting as Verbal Kint was wonderful.  As he recounts the events to the police investigator, and pulls in inanities, you can see the mounting frustration the officers face in trying to figure out who the mysterious Mr. Keyser Soze is.  The police investigator is intent on proving Dean Keaton was the mastermind of these high jinxs and is not entirely convinced Keyser Soze exists.<br />This in my opinion was a facinating weave of a movie.  In the end you will find out if Keyser Soze exists.
0679879269|5.0|I read a lot of books, and let me tell you there are plenty of amazing ones out there, but every so often there comes a book that is beyond stars or exclamations of praise.  The Amber Spyglass one of those books.  I could not think of anything but this book for days after I read it.  I love the characters, who become much more human in this book; I love the story; I love how it made me think about so many things.  It was action-packed and suspenseful but also thought provoking.  Pullman explores on the basic but timeless themes of god, death, and love.  I hate to even make the comparison, but I was shocked that in all the fuss over Harry Potter (which I read and enjoyed) there was hardly a word for His Dark Materials which has SO much more substance.  To anyone  unfamiliar with the series, you MUST read the first two before this one, and beware of reviews that give away major parts of the plot. <br />For the people who are up in arms about Pullman's use of religion in the story, I think you have no basis to criticize him.  The book would be worthless if it didn't make you think.  And he never claimed to be writing a theological tract.  It's just another perspective, and in my opinion that's what counts.   As for the ending, which I will not give away, it would diminish the power of the book to have a perfect happy ending.  <br />I would just like to add that I feel this is in no way a &quot;children's book,&quot; although it involves children and could be enjoyed by young people.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Ok dis is just a tight ... album. In the song Stan it really shows there is a different side to EMINEM. In Kim I know it is a very violent and brutal song, but look at the talent he put into that song. I am giving this album 5 stars because all EMINEM is doing is writing down his feelings he has in real life and putting them into ryhmes, to me that is a truly great idea. I suggest this album to anyone, just give it a try.throughtout the album, as was on his last one. &quot;Ken Kaniff&quot; is just hilarious. Eminem is making fun of the Insane Clown Posse again! In this one, the Posse have quite an intimate time with each other, and the mood ultimately changes when Shaggy utters the word,&quot;Eminem.&quot; Just hilarious! There's also a short skit of Eminem doing a bankjob during &quot;Criminal&quot; and he walks off with the command,&quot;Don't kill anybody!&quot; Ha. Eminem doesn't take lip from anybody!  All in all, this is a great album for all hip hop fans alike. It is certainly Eminem's greatest work. Get it now! some celebrity ever would.  All I'm saying is, don't refuse to listen to  this cd because of what he says, buy it because you like his singing,  that's all that really matters.ng 'Kim' simply because I really don't enjoy hearing  domestic violence and I really disagree with his views on homeosexuals. But  as I've said, I can detach myself from that and not take it too seriusly.  That's the problem, people take this album too seriously. I have to say I  really do love what he's says about Britney, Chisteney, NSYNC, LFO etc.  Because I, like lots of people are sick of hearing about them and being  expected to worship them even through we all know that they have absolutly  no talent and all they are doing is giving those artists who can a bad  name. So, to sum up I think Eminem deserves to be reconaised for what he  is: a talented rapper. He should be left alone to express himself the way  he chooses. Because as he said himself: that's just the way he is.ng the self-empowered absurdity of  stardom.  His blunt, rancorous diatribes state his numerous complaints of  unwelcome attention, including the corporate leeches of the business that  make claims of the rapper's debt that go beyond money.  Moreover, he  expresses amazement over his sudden and overwhelming popularity in songs  like \\"Who Knew\\" and \\"Marshall Mathers\\".  <br /> On the whole, Eminem  preaches to his audience that fame is a bunch of bull and he won't be a  party to it, no matter how much money or attention his music garners.  He  begs us listeners to not take his angry innuendo so seriously, but his  boy-who-cried-wolf act is not exactly a comprehensible tactic.  To sum it  up, he's a clear-cut, brutally honest individual who could give a damn if  the whole world despised him, so long as his daughter Haley grows up to be  a well-adjusted young lady.  We praise you for your bravery, Em.  Just  don't make too many people mad...
B000023VR6|5.0|Only Dre could make an album this good.  Every song grows on you the more you listen.  There is even an instrumental version of the album which is great.  Only Dre could have an album with an instrumental version like that.  This guy rules.  Buy 2001 today!
6305128952|3.0|I'm a fan of both Redford and Thomas, but this movie didn't do it for me. The scenery was beautiful, but the film's schmaltz factor was too high for my taste. And at almost 3 hours in length, the movie would benefit from further editing. If you're in the mood for a long romance and you've got a few hours to spare, consider it...but don't go in with high expectations.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Limp Bizkit strikes back with an alright CD. At first from the other reviews at AMAZON.COM I was presuaded not to buy this record.But I thought Id borrow it from a friend to see if it was really that bad. I wasnt amused when I heard hot dog at first,but after listening to it for a while, I started to like it.Rollin was not the ONLY good song. My Generation, Rollin (Urban Assualt and Air Raid Vehicle), My Way, Livin it Up, and more.It all adds up to a good CD.Also, I think the song Boiler is underrated by a lot of people. I think they should of made a video out of that.Anyway...Do not listen to all reviews about this album.Borrow it from a friend or something and see what you think. I will admit that the lyrics could have been better, but that doesnt make this a bad CD.Worth the $$$.Dont take my word for it, go buy it.
B000002P86|5.0|Nobody does it better !! B.B. put together an outstanding Cd with some of the best artists. If I could give this 6 stars I would. From the opening track If You Love Me with Van Morrison all the way to Night Life with Willie there isn't a bad tune to find. I love how Heavy D is in there putting the rap to the blues. I have quite a few of B.B.'s cds and this one is in my player right at the top of the list. While not having much if any of Willy's stuff, I challenge you to listen to track 13 and not start playing those licks along with him! Blues to the core! I have seen B.B. in concert and he is the man ! And he knows how to pull it all together. It's varied, it's different, it's blues. You won't be disappointed.
B000002UKS|4.0|I am a BIG Foo Fighters fan. One of the biggest! So, my prediction is that everyone that likes the FOO's, will literarally fall in LOVE with this CD (I Did)! EVERY SINGLE song on this album is the best. My favorite songs are Monkey Wrench, My Hero, Hey Johnny Park, Everlong, But like I said , EVERY SINGLE song on this album is the Bomb-diggity.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is such a great movie.  There's just so much humor in every single little bit of it, that it's scary!  If &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; is the king of dialogue related humor, then &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the king of physical, kind of messed up humor.  Also there's tons of action, and the fight scenes are VERY cool.  A must for fans of movies like &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Being John Malcovich&quot;, and even &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (Although they're gonna have to be fans of the Princess Bride, who have grown up a bit).<br />Oh yeah, there's a fantastic anamorphic widescreen tranfer, beautiful sound, and LOADS of extras.  Even if for some strange reason, you don't like this movie, get the DVD for the extra features.
014028009X|4.0|I really admire the way Bridget keeps control (mostly) through this whole book. Every time she writes an entery to her diary she always lists the amount of alcohol she has consumed, ciggarates she has smoked and how much weight she has gained.  Keeping up with this, is true dedication to quitting her nasty habbits.  Although she never completely quits all of them.   I really have never read any other books in this type of genre, it really sits in a class all by itself.  It kept me reading throughout most of the book because of the constant comedy it provided.  This is a very good book to model after if you are trying to write a personal narrative.  It's easier to keep track of events as you go rather than trying to remember them all as they happened to you.  This is accomplished by using the diary theme.  I feel that this way Bridgets character is brought to life more by being able to reveal her inner-most thoughts on herself and on the others around her.  My favorite parts of the book are her confrontations with her mother.  I know that if  I am ever thirty something and single, my mother would act the same way. This also points out Helen Fieldings use of dialoge to bring comedy throughout the piece.   &quot;OH hello darling.  I was just ringing to see what you wanted for Christmas.&quot; &quot;Christmas?&quot; &quot;Would you like a surprise darling?&quot; &quot;NO!&quot; I bellowed.  &quot;Sorry, I mean..&quot; &quot;I wondered if you'd like a set of wheels for your suitcase.&quot; &quot;But I haven't got a suitcase.&quot; &quot;Why dont I get you a little suitcase with wheels attached.  You know like air hostesses have.&quot; &quot;I've already got a bag&quot; This scene in the book provided comedy and a way to relate to the character.  Everyone in their life has had a conversation like this with their mother.  Situations with her mother provides comedy through the whole book.  I really enjoyed reading this book, for the comic relief.  I really think this book is more for women.  Men really wouldn't be able to relate to the more female humor.
B000002TP7|4.0|The Beastie Boys are very talented musicians, no doubt, but I never really got into them personally.  Its not really my kind of thing.  However, Ill Communication is one B.B.'s album that I do enjoy listening to from time to time.  The organization of songs on the CD are a bit screwy in my opinion, but this album has at least one or two songs to suit the tastes of just about anyone. I don't like the Beastie Boys, but some of the songs on Ill Communication did leave an impression on me.
B00003CX8I|4.0|X-men was a good movie. Perfect summer action flick for teenagers to see with their friends. Can't wait for the next movies.
B00004T9UF|1.0|I like rap music alot, but I cannot see what the big deal about this guy is.  He has absoulutely no flow at all, and his beats are among some of the corniest ones I have ever heard(and I have heard alot of them).  My mom bought this CD and I couldn't stand it from the very beginning, not one decent track on the whole thing. I hate to say that she wasted her money, but she did--big time.  ....<br />But, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe Eminem is just too cool for me. real way.  He might get some airplay that a black rapper wouldn't get, but all that means is that poppy radio stations across the country have some better fare for you to listen to. If he's reluctant to use the N-word, I figure that's his perogative.  Some white rappers do use it. His abuse of weaker ones is raising the ante on all rappers. And as far as being &quot;rap's resident alien,&quot; I think that's trash.  He came from a relative outpost on the national hip hop scene (Detroit MI) and built up a core base of true heads on both coasts through mixtapes and radio and underground features before he ever had videos and photos out everywhere. There's nothing wrong with a bad review of an album like this.  There are clearly weaknesses.  But this review was uninformed, and uninspired blather. It was totally unhelpful to a fan of the music and shouldn't be included on the page.
6305399212|5.0|This movie is definately the best in the series!It has even better effects and a more complex story.It does have more bad language which is the only bad thing.Another great thing is how cool the Alien queen looks!This movie has way more action then the first one and has a great climax.The acting is also really great and has a few familiar stars in it besides Sigourney Weaver.Congrats to James Cameron for this great Sci-fi/Adventure.
B0000558LN|5.0|I dont really want to tell too much about the movie. Lets just say that its for all type of audiences. Guys love it cuz of the girls (who dont get naked but totally flaunt what they have), and women love it cuz it has a great storyline. Its awesome, cuz the women in it, are portrayed as sex objects, except their personalities shine. In conclusion I totally loved this movie, the soundtrack was great also!
0790742314|4.0|Well not really a horror film this film still has some pretty grim pieces in it which may not be very good for small children(mainly the infamous microwave scene).But other then that this film is quite fun and has a few good laughs.It is mainly a fantasy film about a boy that gets a mysterious pet for christmas.He is also told three rules which I am sure you know(if you don't just watch the film they tell you quite a few times).Well the rules are broken and the result is a bunch of mean little creatures that terrorize a town.Then the boy,Billy is his name,teams up with his pet and his girlfriend to stop them.A pretty good story and a good film.
0140177396|1.0|I was forced to read this poor excuse for a book for English class. It was awful. I hope Steinbeck's other books are better than this. This book read like a hazy dream more than a novel, and a BORING &amp; UNCLEAR hazy dream at that. I hope this review convinced you to spend your time on worthwile literature as opposed to this.
6301871952|5.0|This movie is not as dark as the first(although it does have some gruesome scenes)is very funny and has some great special effects.Now the little beasts are loose in a giant skyscraper and have broken into a genectics lab and are mutating into bizzare creatures.They must be stopped before night or else they will escape and start terrorizing New York.Zach Galligan returns as Billy and our favorite Mogwai Gizmo is spectacularly brought to life by great special effects.All in all a great film even though it didn't do to well at the box office.
B000002J1M|4.0|This was the album that marked the band's move from cult status to a much wider appreciation.  But the lyrics are even more tangential and the imagery more oblique.  In the 1980s, this album got more FM airplay than any other Genesis recording aoart from 'Selling England ...'.
B00000JGEF|5.0|Though a bit violent this film is a great action film and at times is quite suspenseful.Though not as scary as Alien this new monster is really cool and has some great gadgetry.Schwarzenegger is great as Dutch the leader of the Strike team whose men are being slaughtered by the vicous predator which has a really cool cloaking device.Great action film,not to be missed!
0399146377|1.0|I have listened to all the other Cornwell books.  I am in cassette four of this one and doubt I will bother to finish.  It is not entertaining; it does not hold my interest, my mind wanders. Too bad.
B00000ILE7|2.0|The main bad thing in the movie itself is definately the swearing.The story is so bad because it kills off everything James Cameron did in Aliens.They kill Hicks and the little girl and Bishop ends up in dump.Another thing is how cheesy some of the dialog is.Also how in the heck did an alien survive from the second film?The queen could'nt have layed eggs because her tail was shot off and that is where the eggs are produced so this movie doesn't make to much sense.A sad addition to the great sci-fi series.
B000002NBY|5.0|This album is one of my all-time favourites. I can never get tired of hearing it. And now it has been re-released with fantastic cd-rom enhancement, featuring videos, interviews, photos etc. A wonderful addition to an otherwise perfect album. The booklet includes an 8 page essay by Timothy White as well as all the lyrics. Paul Simon and this album played a significant role in bringing the music of South Africa into the worlds consciousness. Before this, the music of South Africa was largely unknown, but this album changed all that. Ladysmith Black Mambazo were catapulted into almost instant stardom. <br />  This album is brilliant from start to finish. The lyrics, the music, the blend of African/Zydeco and Cajun, make this album an adventure, an experience not to be missed. This is an album that everyone should have in their collection.
B0000214F3|4.0|Before I begin, let me tell you to not be deceived by the &quot;Special Edition&quot; title.  The so-called &quot;Special Edition&quot; is nothing more than a 15 minute Entertainment Tonight clip that is common to many movies looking to cash in on a &quot;New and Improved Special Edition.&quot;  The interviews are poor and the making of the movie is not covered in much detail.<br />But as for the film - the film is great.  Anthony Hopkins, one of the best actors today, gives another great performance as a billionaire with a heart. Imagine that? :) A tale that only Hollywood could write in that Hopkin's character has the &quot;fairy tale life&quot; with a billion dollar business, a giant mansion and is given the chance to face his death before it occurs.<br />A tear jerker for those that are touched by good romances and heart-throb stories.  If you haven't seen this movie, you will not be disappointed.  A &quot;feel good&quot; movie with excellent acting and directing.
B000002UAU|5.0|What is it about The Beatles that encourages some reviewers to write small novels about their albums? I guess it's the fact that they are one, if not, THE, greatest and most successful group ever. Anyway, I won't repeat what has been said in hundreds of reviews here praising the group...as I'm sure everyone knows how great they are anyway. I shall concentrate on the packaging of this album. A great improvement over a lot of The Beatles cd issues. The booklet is 28 pages and packed with photos of the group as well as all the lyrics. There is also a 4 page essay by Peter Blake including 2 pages about the songs themselves, in the order in which they were recorded, with a paragraph about each one. And for those who'd like to know who the personalities are that are featured on the front cover, well it tells you that also. And then of course, there is the music itself...you know most of it I'm sure...it is timeless and will be around longer than any of us.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|My opinion on Gone in 60 Seconds is simply this.Gone In 60 Seconds might have been a really terrible remake to some of u people out there,but truth is,this movie is really great.So what if there's not enough car chases.The movie keeps on the plot and describes the characters really good.Just because there was a 40 minute chase sceen in the original G60S,doesn't mean its any better.Jerry Bruckheimeer did an outstanding job with this movie,and I give this movie my rating.I recommend this movie to everyone out there.
B00004WGC4|5.0|I first bought this set of the complete Fawlty Towers episodes collection about six years ago. I have watched these tapes many times and never fail to find them totally hilarious! My younger cousins who come over to visit often ask for these to watch on the television rather than cartoons!<br />Buy them - you will not regret it. All the characters, including the bit-over-the top John Cleese, succeed in keeping you laughing  through most of each episode. Slapstick, yes, but such enjoyable slapstick!
0767824571|5.0|If you haven't seen this classic spoof on the middle ages in England, you have missed out. The comedy is fresh and keeps on coming in this classic film from the British comedy group Monty Python. The story has to do with King Arthur finding a few good knights and setting out to find the fabled Holy Grail. There are many memorable parts to this film, and it is still very popular today, with good reason. I often find myself recalling amusing parts from the film, such as the witch scene, the wedding scene, and the killer rabbit and the holy handgrenade, which is my favorite part. The film doesn't go overlong, it stays at a lively 90 minutes, and although it leaves you wanting more, it is not going to take a large chunk out of your day. This movie is not a star vehicle and does not use cursing tirades to achieve comedy. (I don't consider the latter true comedy.) However, the stars of this movie, although they all play triple- and quadruple-roles, are endlessly entertaining. This is most certainly their best film, and it is worth buying because you will want to see it again and again.
B0000013GT|5.0|This album is definitely the best out of Outkast's 4 albums. Not taking away from the other albums of course, I own all 4 and have no regrets about any of em. However this album is the only one I listen straight through, every track is dope, and it's not often you find a cd where a skip button isn't needed. The key features that push this album over top of    &quot;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik&quot; are the hooks and the piano, keyboard, vocalist, guitar filled backgrounds. The hooks on this album are simply off the hook! The chick who sings alot of the hooks fits perfectly with the sound of this cd. Basically if you already own an Outkast cd which you like, and it isn't ATLiens, get ATLiens now! If you don't have any Outkast, but your thinking of snagging an album, get this one first!
0451457994|5.0|Although this book was written over thirty years ago, it is still a compelling book and shows very few signs of its age. It makes many predictions, and aside from the obviously wrong ones(nobody lives on the Moon or Mars, retaining 90% of what we learn, the USSR doesn't exist anymore), it has many dead-on predictions as well, such as the population of the Earth, and its story is a great story of what might have been, and it should be read by everyone. I am not a true science fiction fan. I read this book based on a recommendation of a friend. I was not unimpressed.
0553277472|5.0|Every spiritual seeker remembers the book which set them upon the path. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was mine. Pirsig asks students to step out of their four-walled classroom into his Church of Reason, in which quality is the state of things, of motorcycle repairs, and of life itself to be sought.
630024797X|4.0|This film is a German-French coproduction, so it is interesting as a product of how Americans are viewed by the Europeans.  Every scene seems to contain images of something that is decaying or something that is being built.  Cars are everywhere.  Expansive desert vistas mirror the barrenness of the main character's inner life.  Motion is seen as an antidote to pain.  The final confrontation between Harry Dean Stanton and Nastasia Kinski is very moving, and the plight of Stanton's character at the end of the film is heartbreaking.
B000050XEI|5.0|I couldn't wait for Enya's newest album! It is somewhat shorter than her other albums, but I think it is just as good. I found that the songs contained just as much of the layering and voices as her other albums, and once again according to the jacket, all the instruments and voices are hers. That alone is something worth having. Anyway, I would recommend this album as highly as any of her other albums. I have not found any other singer/group like her no matter how much they say &quot;Enya-like&quot;, nobody can do it like her!!!
B00003CXBK|5.0|If you have not seen Princess Mononoke you really should I am confident that you will enjoy it as much as I did!
B000002BBY|5.0|oasis broke through with this cd in usa.They show their influences on this cd mainly beatles and they are using guitars that don't take away from the melody.but on their later cd's you don't hear the melody it's hidden behind louder distorted guitars and thats not what oasis should be doing.they don't need to get louder or have more distortion they just need to get more melodic and this is as melodic as oasis ever was in my opinion.
6305181772|5.0|The movie is definetly a five star movie!  It was awesome action and lots of spy work.
B000002TQB|4.0|this is blurs best cd in my opinion although their self titled cd has some songs on it that are better than anything on here.overall this has more good songs on it than blur and it has the great girls and boys on it,although i think the single version is better than the cd version here.If you can find it i recomend that version.I love songs like parklife and end of a century,they are so british.Blur didnt really breakthrough in usa till they released song2 from their blur cd.which came out a few years later after this cd.But they started making great music right here.
0761119752|5.0|When reading to my daughter, she usually insists that I read the same book repeatedly throughout the day.  And we read so many books everyday.  But this book is one I never get tired of reading.  It's fun, and the reading to a musical beat is great.  I guarantee that it will get any terrible two moment out the door in seconds.  When my daughter or I are in a bad mood, we reach for this book and we start to smile right away. The charcters are adorable and my daughter is delighted to get her pajamas on when I sing the song on the way to her room.  Thank You Sandra Boynton for another terrific book.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Admit it. Willow is the best fantasy genre movie ever madesince the 80's, next to The Princess Bride.<br />All around, the actingis excellent.  Of the lead roles, Val Kilmer nearly steals the show, playing one of his best roles ever as legendary Madmartigan as if he was born for it.<br />For the fantasy gamer out there, this movie has it all. Powerful swordsmen, novitiate wizards and mighty sorcerers, thieves, brownies, fairies, trolls, worgs, castles and kingdoms, and more -- everything a fantasy story should have to stimulate the imagination of young and old.<br />Willow doesn't make the mistake that they made in the Dungeons and Dragons movie that came out at the end of 2000. If you know the good guys are going to win, you just can't expect to capitalize on drama, suspense, and beating sheer odds -- Hello Hollywood, that's only fun with dice! In Willow, the jokes and dialogue are playful, colorful, and plentiful. And they don't go anachronistic! Argh! Don't expect to sustain yourself on drama and suspense when writing a kid's fantasy movie.<br />Willow of course makes none of these mistakes. The soundtrack is great, the replay value is excellent, the jokes make you laugh out loud. If you know what's good for you, you'll eat your blackroot and watch this movie!

0780622650|5.0|Not many movies can rival the TV series that they are based on. LOST IN SPACE is one of those few TV-to-Movie adaptations that can truly be considered cool. The visual effects are breathtaking, the plot and storyline are excellent. Dr. Smith, who was my favorite character in the TV-series, is so evil, that I truly hate him. All the actors give breathtaking performances. I can't wait to see the sequel (That is, if they even make the sequel). If you loved the series, then you'll love this film. I guarantee it. Grade: A+
B00004U2A1|4.0|EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is the highly anticipated sequel to the infamouse cult original THE EVIL DEAD. This film starts out almost as if it will be a remake of the original: Ash and his new girlfriend (?) are driving up to the same cabin in the woods and once again play the tape recording of spells that will summon the dead to possess the living. But this time, Ash takes charge and actually wants to battle the demons that are alway trying to possess him. This film is 50% horror and 50% comedy, and much better made than the original.

B00000G3Q4|4.0|THE EVIL DEAD is one of the most infamous cult classic horror movies to be made (and it spawned two successful sequels, too).   The plot is isn't that hard to understand: four college kids rent a cabin deep in the woods of Tennesse for the weekend. They find an old tape recorder in the cabin's basement and decide to listen to it, not knowing that it contains chanting words that will summon the dead spirits of the underworld to rise up and possess the living. They play the the tape and all hell, literally breaks lose. The only one who remains unpossessed is Ash, and now he must arm himself with shotgun and chainsaw and wage battle against his demon-possessed friends in order to survive the night.  This movie is definitley not for those who have weak stomachs because it is graphically violent and very intense. I liked enough, though, to recommend it to horror fans everywhere!
6304602901|4.0|This is by far the best and most consistently funny of the 7 Police Academy films.  They pretty much got worse as they went on.  Some of the funniest gags take place in this one: Tackleberry going nuts during obstacle training, Harris driving the motorbike into the back of a horse, Hightower tearing the seats out of the car and also flipping one over with his hands, the infamous podium/hooker scene, and of course Mahoney and Jones(the sound effect guy) have several funny scenes.  Fans of the series will want to have this.  The DVD isn't bad for a cheap one.  It includes only the full screen version(bummer), the languages/subtitles(of course), cast and crew bios, interactive menus where you can read facts about the film, a reel recommendations section which suggests another Steve Guttenburg film and other films that are also funny (such as Austin Powers), and a scene selection which is common but welcome.  The best part of the DVD other than the film itself is the inclusion of all 7 theatrical trailers for each Police Academy film.  Genuinely funny and contrary to other reviews, this is no where near the worst film ever made.  See it for yourself many many many times on many many many different occasions (inside Police Academy joke).
B00004U3UG|4.0|In ARMY OF DARKNESS, the sequel to EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN, our shotgun-packing and chainsaw-slashing hero Ash finds himself transported through time and landing right in the middle of a war between medievil knights and skeleton deadites. Only one man can help the knights win the battle against the undead and that man is Ash. More humor and gore help this third entry in the EVIL DEAD series. Get the unrated Directors Cut on DVD or VHS.
B0000524CY|5.0|So I thought this movie was scary the old way, but i was shocked by this.  That spiderwalk scene, though about five seconds long, made me cry actual tears.  I feel the reason the director did not include this in the original version is because people would have died in the theatre of heart failure, and he did not feel like getting sued.  So see it because it's just so scary.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|my english is not very wel but this film is so funny!!
B00000255F|5.0|This is, quite simply, the greatest album ever made. I've been a Springsteen fan ever since I first heard 'Born to Run' on an airplane. It was instantly my favorite song and I couldn't belive that there was this kind of music floating around out there that I had never heard of. I ran out to buy this CD after arriving home and I was initially a bit disappointed, but gradually, song by song, I got to appreciate this album for what it is: a masterpiece. The opening of Thunder Road still makes my heart skip a beat, and the song itself is haunting. Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out is a great song, but I don't personally appreciate it as much as others do. Night is thrilling, a lot of fun too sing, and far too short. The opening to Backstreets is beautiful. The rest of the song is fabulous, but the opening music just blows me away. Born to Run, what can I say. It is the greatest song ever recorded. She's the One is just an old fashioned good time, and it's really easy to play on the guitar, my second favorite song on the CD. Meeting Across the River is sort of creepy and hard to get used to, but once you learn to appreciate it, you really appreciate it. Jungleland is epic, a mini rock opera, and the interlude is fantastic. In the end I can't say much except that your life will not become complete until you buy this album, you don't know what your missing.
B000050FEN|5.0|David Fincher's &quot;Seven,&quot; according to one of the experts on one of the commentaries in this DVD edition, has become some sort of modern classic. It doesn't surprise me. &quot;Seven&quot; takes typical cop-film ideas and morphs them into a dark, creepy, memorable tale of serial murder. The violence of the film is psychological, because what's really disturbing is the things the film makes you think about, not on screen gore. Look closely and you'll see that there is not that much violence in the movie, it's the brilliant way in which Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker (8MM, Sleepy Hollow) set up mood and atmosphere. The cinematography is dark, beautiful and shadowy, giving the impression that there are evil things lurking in the shadows or just down the hall. The characters can be believed, and we really do care about them when the final shock comes. The performances are also superb, not least Kevin Spacey's serial killer, John Doe, who seems like a cousin of Hannibal Lecter. &quot;Seven&quot; also has a mind, the details of the plot are complex because they are not just materialistic things, you really have to think, to examine the ideas and thoughts in the story. This is the film, which I think, remains David Fincher's masterpiece. His latest, &quot;Fight Club,&quot; was less intelligent or memorable. It was good, but doesn't go in league with this masterwork of the macabre. &quot;Seven&quot; raises chilling little feelings in you, disturbing thoughts and ideas, which is what great horror is supposed to do, yet it never loses intelligence. This special DVD edition will offer more material to better understand the film's structure, there's even a look at the making of John Doe's notebooks. &quot;Seven&quot; is a must for those who love a smart, creepy tale.
B00000IAU3|5.0|For the past 6 months, I have been looking for the artist that performed the song &quot;Thank You&quot; in the HBO Movie &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot;...you know, that infamous scene between Ellen DeGeneres and Sharon Stone.  Well...I've found it!  And I was so happy to find that the entire CD met and then exceeded all of my expectations for this Sarah McLachlan-like artist.<br />If you listen to this CD, from cover to cover, you realize that Dido is telling us a story...of love, commitment, relationships.  You hear her go from desire, to new love, to love, to the break up, to the post-break up.  She is able to combine every emotion I've ever experienced (or heard of another girl experiencing) into amazing lyrics, soft but powerful music and an overall feeling of sensuality.  Her voice, and the way it fluctuates from husky and breathy to almost hard and forceful really adds to the entire feeling the CD emits. <br />I suggest that you keep this CD in your car, for long drives (alone or not...), in your Discman, in your stereo...everywhere...so you don't miss a chance to hear this splendid artist.  You'll start to feel that she's really Here With You...
630460291X|2.0|I'll admit it--this movie is one of my &quot;guilty pleasures&quot;. Never mind that Kevin Costner's performance as Robin Hood won't make anyone forget Errol Flynn. The rest of the cast is great--especially Alan Rickman, and this particular take on the story is very entertaining. My problem is that whoever designed the DVD version must be related to the woman who designed the presidential ballot in Palm Beach County!! Whoever you are, having a movie divided by two sides went out with LP albums and laserdiscs! Sure, there are DVD's with material on both sides of the disc--in most cases, it's two different versions of the same movie. It can be be widescreen/pan &amp; scan or original version/director's cut. The point is that I don't know anyone who enjoys getting up in the middle of a movie to flip the disc over--that's why laserdiscs never enjoyed a lot of popular acceptance! It would be nice if this movie could be re-released on a DVD that is not designed like a butterfly ballot!!
B000002KGT|5.0|Like so many top rock bands, Fleetwood Mac somehow managed to become greater than the sum of its parts. When the members of this band were able to really work together, the result was pop/rock of a very high order. Unfortunately, because of their well-documented personal trials and tribulations, along with drug and alcohol abuse problems and exhaustion resulting from several years of intensive touring, they have not really worked together very much since the end of the 1970's. Their last two studio albums were done essentially on an &quot;every man for himself&quot; basis, and it shows. The last reunion effort ended prematurely.<br />When &quot;Rumours&quot; was recorded, however, Chrissie McVie, Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were clicking on all cyclinders. McVie, Nicks and Buckingham all contribute songs. They are pulled together by Buckingham's talent for arranging, as well as by the gifted ensemble work of the band. The vocal harmonies are exceptional and Buckingham provides outstanding guitar work. Among the best tracks are &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, &quot;The Chain&quot;, &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;, &quot;I Don't Want To Know&quot; and &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;. &quot;Don't Stop&quot; has become a rock anthem. &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; is a personal favorite. Stevie's songs often have an ethereal quality to them. Here, an ethereal and somewhat bitter lyric ... is accompanied by Buckingham's elegantly spare guitar work to create a dramatic and haunting song. The whole album is, in fact, characterized by a dramatic quality and emotional intensity that sets it apart.<br />&quot;Rumours&quot; is one of the best-selling rock albums ever. Deservedly so. It is pop/rock of a very intense and high quality. It is also another of my ten favorite albums. If you don't have a copy, do yourself a favor. Get a copy and give it a listen.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you're getting started with the Beatles and either can't or won't buy the Red and Blue albums, this is the one to have.  It's a little heavy on John and Paul at the expense of Ringo and George, but hey, they didn't write as many #1 songs.  Besides, George and Ringo have their own greatest hits albums if you're yearning for Octopus's Garden or While My Guitar Gently Weeps.<br />If you're already a Beatle-phile, this is a nice one to toss in the car for a long commute, otherwise these aren't songs you don't already own someplace else.
0375500901|5.0|Silva does a great job with the character devlopment of this timely novel. I really felt that I understood the motivation for Sarah &amp; Gabriel's actions. The plot takes a few twists, but it is pretty straight forward once it gets going. It's a fast read. I do wish he had done a bit more with the charming Peel, a minor character but perhaps a key to unlocking Gabriel.
B000002G87|5.0|I bought this as a 2 disc set about a decade ago having only heard Layla a handful of times.  It's frightening when probably the greatest love song of all time (and one of the greatest all time period) may not be the best on the album.<br />Not to disparage his unplugged cover of the title song, but it doesn't hold a candle to the passion of the original.  It's just not quite right without the opening guitar riff and the long piano at the end.<br />It's difficult to define the pinnacle of a career that has spanned almost four decades, especially when the product is to consistently superior to the rest of the drivel being played; but this may be Clapton's high point.
B000053ZRR|5.0|Some time ago, I was at a local Hollywood Video and I saw BON JOVI: LIVE FROM LONDON! on the shelf. I had to rent it. It was good but was short and could have been better. When I found out there was going to be a new BON JOVI live video, I freaked, but was skeptical about if had all the good songs. I found out on the internet and got it. It rules. An 80,000 people sold-out stadium. Best performances: &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;, &quot;Sleep When I'm Dead&quot;, and &quot;Say It Isn't So&quot;. But I wish they had &quot;This Ain't a Love Song&quot;, and &quot;Never Say Goodbye.&quot; Buy this DVD.
6300214753|5.0|I absolutely loved FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. It's absolutely hillarious! I was laughing so hard while watching this movie that I just could not stop. Matthew Broderick is awesome in this movie. Anyway, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is basically about a high school kid named Ferris Bueller - duh - (played by Broderick) who hates going to school. So he's always trying to think of ways to stay home, mostly through pretending to act sick. One day, while he's faking his illness to stay home on a beautiful day, he decides to get his girlfriend out of school and his best friend (who's actually really sick in bed) to come with him and hang out. Well, they end up going on some &quot;wild rides&quot; while skipping school...and the entire day the principal of their school is trying to follow Ferris and get him into trouble! This is one movie that I recommend to everybody, but especially high school kids 'cause it shows you how to have fun when you skip school for the day!
1878424319|5.0|I purchased this book after reading a brief blurb about it in a magazine.  I am so happy I did.  Imagine, if we all were impeccable with our words?  And boy, how I wish I didn't take things personally.  We all know what happens when you make assumptions.  But the part to always do my best is refreshing.  I repeat these four agreements every day, as a reminder to do my best.  To become the person I want to be.  Since reading this book I have come into situations where I thought twice before opening my mouth, and chose to do the right thing.<br />I plan to give this little book to everyone I know this year for their birthday.  It is a little book on how to make our lives (and others') a bit better.
0553106635|5.0|This book is superb. It is unputdownable. Martin is a gifted storyteller with a fabulous imagination, great flair (particularly for capturing dialogue) and a very, very good sense of humour. This trilogy is easily the best SFF series out there and each book is a contender for the best SFF book too. If anything, the books just keep getting better. Brilliant, vast, epic, original, breathtaking, quirky -- yet very humorous in parts. [Robert Jordan should sit down, read this series, compare his own work to it and re-think his game plan]. If you fail to like this book I'd be very surprised.
B000003BDJ|4.0|Of course there are no weak songs here but if this is all you have you are missing out on at least 80 or 90% of the Stones best work. Lots of classic rock radio standards but you are missing out on their true brillance if you don't own atleast 10 of their albums. This is far from definitive but it is a nice way to get acquinted with some of their work and this is where I started.
B00003CXBK|5.0|First of all, i enjoy watching anime once in a while. I will rent them every now and then but own none.. except for this one. It is truely amazing and unique. The story catches you almost right away, like a few minutes into the movie and you are already saying &quot;wow, this is gonna be good&quot;. the animation and detail quality is much better than the average anime. The music gives great atmosphere and sets a perfect mood for the film. Don't expect an all out blood fest but it does have its share of great action scenes. I must emphasize though on the extreme quality of the story. Thats what makes me really love this one. This is currently my favorite movie, next to the StarWars trilogy of course :) (episode 1 was ok..).
B000002UAU|1.0|This isn't rock and roll. It's sinitra-esque orchestral pop. The most overrated, crappy piece of trash ever.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Ah &quot;Gladiator.&quot;  What a film.  The execs at Dreamworks said that it was going to be &quot;bigger than Titanic!&quot;  While that was a bit of a stretch, the film was still a big deal.  It brought sandal and sword epics of the fifties and sixties back in a big way.  It made Russel Crowe an overnight success.  It brought Ridley Scott back in a big way.  And it brought big bucks into the box office.<br />&quot;Gladiator&quot; is a really good film.  It's only problem is that &quot;Braveheart&quot; already came out.  It's hard not to draw parallels between the films considering they both revolve around characters who are avenging the deaths of their wives while they fight political persecution in their country.<br />But what &quot;Gladiator&quot; tackles head on that &quot;Braveheart&quot; ignored is the issue of identity, speciffically in Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus.  Here is a great film villain that we almost sympathize with because what makes him tick is so clearly portrayed to the audience.  Phoenix is fantastic in this role, but, then again, it would have taken alot of hard work to mess up a character so well written.<br />Along with a refreshingly original score, beautiful cinematography, a star making performance by Crowe, and amazing battle scenes, Gladiator has become one of the top contenders for Oscar this year.  Does it deserveb the top prize?  No of course not.  The material isn't freh enough.  But its better than alot of other films this year.
B000000OPZ|5.0|This album stays one of my all time top 10. Excitement is understatement to describe this album. If you like Whitesnake's Greatest Hits, maybe this is your second pick for exploring great rock kingdom created by David Coverdale and John Sykes.<br />Crying In The Rain is good opening track sure to blow you away. Still Of The Night is one of my #1 favorite rock tracks of Whitesnake. You know Is This Love or Here I Go Again because it became huge hit worldwide. Straight From Your Heart and Don't Turn Away are excellent tracks and my favorites.<br />If you are classic rock fans, it is the album you should never miss.
B00004XQ83|5.0|There are many, many of us who grew up with rock, from its birth to its prime, partial demise, and now resurgence as classic.  We have developed notions that the only good music left is the music from the sixties, and even now we listen to those same songs or newer ones that capture that rock flavor. Now, through the soundtrack of this very interesting film, we have a chance to listen to the captivating lyrics and simple melodies of music that eminated from the heart, soul, and pain of the depression era.  Unpretentious, sweet, truthful, and sometimes deeply sexy, this variety of songs can be mesmerizing to those of us who have kept an ear out for something worthwhile to listen to.  Even though the qualities of rap, punk, Ska, or hip-hop have their places among the young masses, they somehow don't click with many of us a generation or two further along, particularly in the satisfying ways that we long for.  This exposure to &quot;new&quot; music from very old sources finds here some very satisfied listeners.  The siren song especially speaks in a subtle, powerfully seductive voice that befits the tale of the Argonauts.  Many other songs simply find a comfortable, poetic, genuine sharing of human feelings.  A passionate delight throughout.
B00000I9P1|5.0|When Seconds Count is more than an album. It is the collection of great should-have hits such as Keep It Right Here(my #1 favorite), Rebel Son, Backstreet Love Affair, When Seconds Count.<br />Why Is This Love became only top ten hit should be the mystery of the 80s. My theory is: by the time When Seconds Count was released, pop rock style became the norm so their great work buried among the heap of pop rock works.<br />When Seconds Count was my #1 favorite until they released Too Hot To Sleep which made me almost forget this album even existed at all. Waiting for THTS to come up for my future review.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|when i got this movie,i wasn't expecting it to be fall down on the floor funny(it wasn't),but i expected to at least chuckle more than once.<br />my advice to anyone who is thinking of buying this dvd? DON'T.... if you want to see a better movie that parodies other movies or tv shows,buy airplane or the naked gun...they're well worth the money.
B00001U0E1|5.0|If you want a taste of Elizabethiana, the costumes and sets in this movie can't be beat.  One can practically whiff the smells of the streets of London.  And you can even allow the cute and sassy touches to distract you (the &quot;Stratford&quot; souvenir cup, the cabbie-mannered ferryman, etc.) without missing the real strength of the story.  The screenwriting is masterful in mirroring the love story with the creation of &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;  And the more you know of Shakespeare's plays and their many presentations on stage and film, the more you'll appreciate the crafty fun the makers of this film must have had.  The acting talent here, too, is right up to the charge:  Everyone is so fine, that Ms. Paltrow does all she can to keep up, and really ends up overacting -- still, she is a diamond among even brighter stones in this gem of a movie.  This is best viewed in a room full of close friends sharing much wine.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This was simply the best movie in a while.  You must see this movie.
B000002BQK|3.0|This is the first album where Mariah really started submerging herself in hip-hop. This is a likeable album, though not near as good as her first album or MUSIC BOX. &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;My All&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot; are probably the songs people know best from this album. &quot;Honey&quot; is a grooving hip-pop track, while both &quot;My All&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot; are ballads that soar. Other noteworthy tracks are &quot;The Roof&quot;, a sassy, sexy track, &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Outside&quot;, both personal ballads. &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Ones&quot; are pleasing to my ears, while &quot;Breakdown&quot; is OK. One thing, I wish she'd sing her songs and not mumble them. I had to look at the lyrics the first time I heard it, and I don't usually do that! It towers over RAINBOW, though.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|*In early November, 1999, I read a review in (...) Weekly magazine, reviewing When the Pawn... from Fiona Apple.  The review was glowing (the album received an A), and being an owner of Tidal, Fiona's debut CD, I decided to purchase When the Pawn... soley on that review.  I had not heard a single track on the record; I bought it in faith in Fiona and EW.  Best music-buying decision of my life.      *I popped the CD into my car and thus began my enjoyment of this CD.  The opening beats of &quot;On the Bound&quot; are engrossing, sucking you into the rhythm and lyrics (&quot;You're all I need... and maybe some faith would do me good.&quot;)  In &quot;To Your Love&quot;, she complains to a lover that in their relationship &quot;...caution could but rarely ever helps.&quot;  &quot;Limp&quot; is an all out assault to another guy, or maybe the same, saying that &quot;it won't be long 'till you'll be lyin' limp in your own hands.&quot;  Harsh.  And those are only the first three songs on the CD.       *The CD is pumped with emotion, but clever lyrics and constantly changing musical tempos keep the album from sinking into a depressional abyss, something Fiona critics say happens too often in her work.  I disagree.  Music is about emotion, and this music is a raw and powerful as music can be, atleast for me.  But I am a seventeen year old girl, and that should be taken into consideration.       *Every track on this CD is listenable.  The standouts include &quot;On the Bound,&quot; &quot;Paper Bag,&quot; (which includes my favorite lyric on the CD, &quot;He said it's all in your head, and I said so's everything but he didn't get it,&quot;) &quot;A Mistake,&quot; &quot;Fast As You Can,&quot; &quot;Get Gone,&quot; and &quot;I Know.&quot;  Now, I am aware that these songs constitute half of the disc, but that is just a testament to the quality of the CD.  Any other reviewer could list the other five songs on the CD as their favorites, and I would not argue their opinion.*If you have any interest in this CD, and if you are reading this review then you must, I highly recommend this CD.  I have talked several of my acquantances into buying it, and they have not regretted it.  I don't think you will either.
B0000028VT|5.0|This is Mariah's absolute best album to date. It's touching, beautiful and inspiring. The best track is &quot;Hero&quot;, without a doubt. That song still brings a smile to my face. &quot;Dreamlover&quot; rocks the house, &quot;Anytime You Need A Friend&quot; and &quot;Music Box&quot; bring a peaceful feeling, while &quot;Just To Hold You Once Again&quot; and &quot;Without You&quot; still bring tears to my eyes. &quot;Never Forget You&quot; also brings a sad feeling to the house. &quot;All I Ever Wanted&quot; is GORGEOUS! &quot;I've Been Thinking About You&quot; and &quot;Now That I Know&quot; are OK, but not the best. <br />There is NO filler on this CD, IMO. Mariah sings in a strong, clear, beautiful voice. No mumbling on this one. If you are a true Mariah fan, pick this one up!
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the best album I've heard since Corrosion of Comformity's deliverance. Very well put together in musical standards,and never seems to lose you. Besides the fact that this record has no swearing, you get the feeling there should be. There is no let down, yea maybe one or two softer songs but they get the point across. If your a big rap-rock fan this is the album to get. <br />                        AJW                            Seattle, WA
B00003CWL6|1.0|This really is a dreary little film. In years to come it will be remembered just as Ordinary People is today, one that swept the awards boards back then, by now has absolutely no bite whatsoever. The acting is horrible, the script very weak, the directing very dull (Mendes should stick to running his theatre in London, though shouldn't direct anything there again). All in all a waste of time. I would say I'm surprised at the response of the general public to the mess that is American Beauty, but then that's the power of the media for you: they tell us what's good, most people believe them. Please start thinking for yourself people. Please.
0441172717|4.0|Dune...Arrakis...Desert Planet...A global atmosphere of no precipitation, yet the planet is the most significant and important of them all.  Why?  Because it has spice, the most valuable substance in existence.  House Atreides is assigned to take over rule of Dune to replace the Harkonnens.  The book is filled with excellent dialogue, fine word choice, and excellent atmosphere.  However, I don't consider it &quot;Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece&quot; as the cover says.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but I've read better.  And after all, this rating system is relative.  (Besides, it's not like my opinion will change anything).  Frank Herbert had a knack for putting catchy phrases and captivating fight scenes, but essentially, it could have been been better.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I think that anyone who doesn't like this CD either (1) hasn't listened to it enough or (2) didn't like Limp Bizkit in the first place.  CS&amp;HDFW is even more amazing than Significant Other.  This isn't a CD that you can listen to once and make a judgment on.  You really need to listen to it at least a few times to take it all in.  <br />I can't believe all of the reviews on here complaining about the language.  You must be living in a hole if you didn't realize that LB swears through most of their songs.  (Didn't you notice all the beeping out on the radio?)  If you're offended by the F word, don't buy this CD.  <br />I couldn't stop laughing the first time I listened to Hot Dog, and that's now probably my favorite song on the album.  Fred's voice rocks.  The rest of the songs are great, too, especially the remix of Rollin', Full Nelson, Livin' It Up, Take A Look Around, and Getcha Groove On.  Don't miss Ben Stiller making fun of LB during the Outro.  Absolutely hilarious.  You can't expect them to constantly put out the same kind of album.  I think that this album shows how they have and are evolving as artists.  You must buy this CD!
0767853636|5.0|A very upbeat 1980's musical.  The cast was great and are all from broadway roots.  This movie adaptation was nice to watch.  The musical numbers are additive and the story simple.  Little ophran (1930's) trys unsuccessfully to find parents and ends up living happily ever after with a Billionaire &quot;Daddy Warbucks.&quot;  The kids will love it and encore watchings will be frequent.  You'll be humming or singing the tunes too.  Great family addition to the musical library.  DVD transfer nice and vibrant with good sound.
0375707972|3.0|The Reader by Bernhard Schlink starts off with a young boy, Michael, falling in love with an older woman, Hanna, who is a worker on the streetcar. Their love is obviously controlled by Hanna and she often gets upset with him when she thinks that he will leave her. Hanna starts to do things that don't add up in Michael's mind. One day when he leaves her a note, she gets upset and claims that she never saw the note. I could tell that she was hiding a secret, but did not know exactly what it was. Hanna's character was not developed very well and even when I discovered her secret I did not feel that it explained her actions earlier in the book. This was a weakness in the book because I wanted to know what it was about Hanna that affected Michael's life so much. Michael's emotions were clear throughout the book, but I found myself wondering what it was about Hanna that made her so special to him. I felt a strong point in this book was reading Michael's changes in emotions and how Hanna completly changed his life forever. Another strong point of this book was that it showed a different view on the Holocaust. Hanna was a woman in charge of running the concentration camps and it lets the reader know that these people doing the disgusting crimes were actually people. My favorite part of this book was near the ending because I thought it was interesting to read about how Hanna and Michael had changed each other's lives. My least favorite part was the middle during the trial. I felt that some parts really dragged on. Overall I really enjoyed this book and it was an interesting look on the people involved in the Holocaust and a young love that kept on throughout the years.
B000051VQR|5.0|I started listening to Green Day about 8 years ago, every day since they bring an album out, i am ALWAYS the first down to the shop to get it, (in most cases before the staff of the shop).  I picked up my Green Day album and rushed home to put in on my CD player, only to find that the music had changed from the usually Green Day i was used to but I found this a very plesent supprise!  After listening to the album about 3 times i was convinced that Billie Joe and the boyz had been taken over by the GOD of music and had created this wonderfull album. I truely recommend this album to any music fan, buy it and see.
630419949X|5.0|This was definitely an action packed film. Our hero Arnold plays the role of the good guy. Arnold is the &quot;eraser&quot; who is employed by the Federal Witness Protection Program. He helps people dissapear after they testify for the government in criminal cases. Thanks to Arnold they can start new lives. The villain is played by James Caan who is a cop gone bad. Throughout the film the forces of Caan are trying to kill Arnold and a female witness that he is protecting. Arnold survives every attempt.The movie is action packed with some dazzling escapes by Arnold and his witness. They come close to being killed several times. The ending is especially good. This is without question a very good movie. Watch it and enjoy.
0399146253|4.0|Without giving anything away... let me say that this book on its own might strike a reader new to Cornwell as very heavy and dark.  It's insidious, sometimes melodramatically dark and deep, and often dispairing... but that's taking it out of context.  For the readers who've been following Kay Scarpetta as Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia, you can place this book clearly and gracefully in the heart of Scarpetta's learning curve.<br />A successful, independent woman who's borne more than her share of life's trials in the face of an esteemed and satisfying career, the lack of authentic intimacy in her life finally begins getting to her.  Dr. Scarpetta's had meaningful relationships, meaningful friendships, and even a meaningful pseudo parent/child relationship... but she remains an island alone.  Her fight against death, impossible to win, dooms her to frustration and impotence, and in this book, this truth finally dawns on her.  Her job, her major source of confidence and connectedness, piroutettes against her in a crescendo of very personal loose-ends from previous stories.<br />I think the element of introspection in this novel makes it a pivotal story in the Scarpetta series.  However, I give it four stars because, as I said, it stands alone less strongly than it should for five.
0312954468|5.0|I am a huge Wilbur Smith fan.  &quot;River God&quot; is the best novel I have ever read.  My second favorite Smith book is his newest: &quot;Monsoon&quot;, 3 &quot;Men of Men&quot;, 4 &quot;The Sunbird&quot;, 5 &quot;Golden Fox&quot;, 6 &quot;Burning Shore&quot;, 7 &quot;The Diamond Hunters&quot;.  If you have read all the Wilbur Smith books like I have, you'll yearn for more, but it takes him years to come up with a new book these days.  You might look at &quot;Churchill's Gold&quot; by James Follett after you have read all of Mr. Smith's books.  It is very similar in style and quality to most of the Courtney series.  If you like &quot;River God&quot; you will probably also love &quot;The Sunbird&quot;.  It is very similar in theme.
B0000060AK|5.0|&quot;Ariodante&quot; (1735) was intended for some of the leading performers of Handel's time. Stiff competition from Nicola Porpora and the threat of bankruptcy `forced' Handel to write works of higher quality for the first time since the Big Three: &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; (1724), &quot;Tamerlano&quot; (1724) and &quot;Rodelinda&quot; (1725). <br />Two things make &quot;Ariodante&quot; and its sister opera &quot;Alcina&quot; (1735) exceptional: 1. singers of the four major voice categories (i.e. soprano, alto, tenor and bass). Often Handel operas do without low male voices, e.g. &quot;Teseo&quot; (1713) and &quot;Amadigi&quot; (1715). 2. the services of the notorious French ballerina Mlle. Salle and her ballet troupe.   <br />The instrumentation of &quot;Ariodante&quot; is not as grand as in &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, &quot;Rinaldo&quot; (1711) or &quot;Teseo&quot; which are designed to make a splash and to ravish the senses. In &quot;Ariodante&quot; the orchestra is `down-scaled' to strings, oboes, horns and continuo - a trumpet also appears when Ginevra is vindicated. Handel utilises the orchestra in such a way that the sound world varies from one aria to the next to capture the right mood to reflect and propel the drama.   <br />Minkowski is onto something great with his version - and what an inspired reading it is! He keeps the drama moving at a fast pace (maybe too fast sometimes, like Dalinda's final aria). It's hard to believe it, but the singers and wonderful orchestra keep up with him in this live recording. <br />Minkowski has Anna Sofie von Otter as Ariodante, the role created for the talented castrato Cusanino. Handel wrote exceptionally demanding and expansive coloratura arias for Cusanino (see Teseo's arias in &quot;Arianna in Creta&quot;). Von Otter sings with a clinical precision that can be hard to listen to at times and her already androgynous voice does not lend much appeal to her interpretation; like Fischer-Dieskau she tries to colour every note and syllable to make it more meaningful - too much spice is just as undesirable as too little - but she sings the zipping coloratura of the first version of &quot;Con l'ali&quot; with unequalled skill! For me &quot;Scherza infida&quot; suffers the most from her overbearing colouration of the vocal line, and &quot;Dopo notte&quot; does not touch Janet Baker's first exulted recording. Nonetheless, I think few mezzos today can equal von Otter in this repertoire.  <br />The Ginevra, Lynne Dawson, delivers an uneven performance. In moments Dawson's singing can be exquisite and in others painful. She does have a very beautiful voice, but at times she sounds strained. The demands placed on Anna Strada del Po, who first created this role, seem unreasonable at first - until you listen to Edith Mathis do justice to this role on the Leppard set.   <br />Veronica Cangemi sings Dalinda. Her runs are delivered at a cracking pace - and one wishes sometimes that Minkowski had given her more breathing space, literally and figuratively. Even in the more reflective moments her character comes off like Blondchen on 78 speed. But she delivers the goods at all times.<br />Ewa Podles sings (&quot;sings&quot; being the understatement of the century) Polinesso. Nothing can quite describe how Podles transforms Polinesso's less spectacular music into something special. She delivers the most outstanding performance on this recording, turning every aria into a Gala Event! No words can convey the talents of Podles: coloratura, high notes, low notes, long phrases - none holds any terror for this incredible ARTIST. Perfect diction, perfect colouration of the vocal line without resorting to ham effects make it a complete mystery why this underrated singer is not more widely recorded. <br />Richard Croft as Lurcanio has the least interesting character next to Odoardo in this opera, but he brings Lurcanio to life in his arias. Croft's &quot;Il tuo sangue&quot; is probably one of the most excitingrecorded Handel arias ever. <br />Denis Sedov as the The King has a beautiful, full and flexible bass voice. He has a few stunning arias, and he delivers a very fine performance.<br />&quot;Ariodante&quot; can really be seen as Handel's &quot;Cosi&quot;. In both operas the focus is on the emotional turmoil of the characters and not the social implications of their actions. Two moments stand out here: the sinfonia introducing Act 2 and the first Ariodante/Ginevra duet. The King interrupts them before they can continue with the da capo! <br />&quot;Ariodante&quot; is not just pretty music. Handel was always ahead of his contemporaries: in &quot;Io ti bacio&quot; Ginevra leaves her father to await execution. The introduction consists of four notes in the continuo. Then the violins alone accompany the vocal line in unison until all the instruments join in harmony on a Neapolitan chord - the 18th century chord to convey great despair. Most revolutionary is the second Act ending with an accompanied recitative to reflect Ginevra's madness - in the Baroque era this is unheard of. Then there is the intimate Lurcanio/Dalinda duet which starts of as an aria for Lurcanio, but when you expect the B section to start Dalinda joins, and what magic, what bliss, when their voices unexpectedly unite in harmony at the end with the tenor singing a 3rd above the soprano - very Puccini! Mozart is said to have remarked: &quot;Handel understands effect better than any of us - when he chooses, he strikes like a thunderbolt...&quot;<br />I cannot resist mentioning the consecutive arias: Ginevra's &quot;Volate amore&quot;; The King's &quot;Voli colla sua tromba&quot; and Ariodante's &quot;Con l'ali di costanza&quot; which caused Burney to complain of Act 1 having nothing but &quot;wings and flying&quot;!<br />In closing: &quot;Ariodante&quot; appeals to our human and romantic nature, and unlike &quot;Lotario&quot; does not deal with the fate of nations, but rather the emotions of the individual. All these factors, and I wager the reduced orchestra, make us focus on the dark, distressing and mysterious atmosphere which pervades over this opera and its characters, an atmosphere perhaps only equalled in Wagner's &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. I look forward to Minkowski's reading of &quot;Arianna in Creta&quot;.

0812589041|1.0|Suggested Reading: Tales of Pirx the Pilot, by Stanislaw Lem. In this book or its sequel, find out what a real writer can do with stories about a space cadet.<br />What can account for the popularity of Ender's Game? Card's prose is mushy and numb, his dialogue fake-sounding. The book gets off to not a bad start, but things quickly get worse rather than better. The pace is slow enuf to kill a horse, especially the interminable middle section in which Ender masters the stupid &quot;battle room,&quot; or whatever it is called. The climactic moment is anything but. The denoument,in which Ender rockets away to the stars with his ripe and comely sister is total, horrible crap, bringing to a close one of the mostest dumbest books I've readed in years.<br />I would guess this thing is most popular with people who not only do not normally read science fiction books, but who normally do not read books. It may also appeal to disgruntled adolescents or psychologically-damaged adults who got the stuffing beat out of them a lot as kids; now they read Ender and imagine they're beating out other people's stuffing as a little 8-year-old soldier. What does this book teach the talented but misguided 10-year-olds who wrote most of the 1,200 reviews? All of the meaningless crap-work, all of the emotional and physical abuse, all the boredom, all the stupidity from authority figures -- there's actually a good reason for all of it. You're fighting the buggers, kid (speaking of that, the only enjoyable part of reading this was ferreting out the dozens of latent yet sexy gay references-woohoo!).

B00003OSTK|5.0|This is one my all-time favorite delights: MGM at its peak as the glamour studio of the world! Movie immortals at their peaks, too: Garbo, unforgettable as the fading ballerina; a fantastic Joan Crawford, warm, sensual, adorable, far from the wooden zombie she became by the seventies; John Barrymore, dashing, charming, just before his slide into acute alcoholism. On and on. Adrian designed the unforgettable gowns and dresses for la Garbo and Crawford. This was only a prelude to the phenomenal gowns, capes, fur-lined wintercoats, hats, gloves, boots he was to create for Garbo that same year in her masterpiece, &quot;Mata Hari.&quot; I go into detail about both these classics in my book on old Hollywood, &quot;The Kiss of King Kong.&quot; Of all the stars in this movie, it's Crawford who steals the spotlight with her poignant scene with the dying Grindelein (Lionel Barrymore)when she takes over the phone and, barely able to keep her voice from breaking, orders two train tickets to Paris. What a show! No wonder so many of us had much rather watch these golden classics when movies were made by small groups of geniuses: Adrian, cameraman William Daniels, directors like Edmund Goulding, true stars like Garbo, Barrymore, Crawford, when we get nothing but garbage today like &quot;American Beauty&quot; &quot;Dude, Who STole My Car&quot; and &quot;Dracula 2000&quot;.
068484267X|5.0|From the minute I saw the cover of the book, I thought I wonder...what could this book be about.   It was a must have book!  I could not put the book down!  The story of Frank's life is one that so many people could relate too in so many ways.  The poverty, alcohol, death, and that one teacher who stood out in school.  Even the fleas...not funny but if you have ever had them in your house, you know!  As Frank gets older he helps take his family from rags to doing ok.  It is such a heart warming book and I just could not put it down.  I waited with little patience for &quot;Tis&quot; the second part of the book.  Another wonderful book!
6305127646|4.0|At last! the notorious Simon Templar returns to our screens ! The Saint himself isn't quite the character of the criminally out-of print Leslie Charteris novels, but is suitably updated and polished for the 1990s. The film is best considered as an &quot;origins&quot; film in the vogue of Tim Burton's &quot;Batman&quot; trying to introduce a new audience to the Saint. <br />Oddly, Mr Charteris does not rate a mention by the films titles.<br />Plot wise the story hangs together with more coherence that the two &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; movies and Val Kilmer does creditable service as Templar(especially in his various guises). The disguises are a bit more believable and the gadgets are employed in a creative, yet functionally manner. You do believe that the stuff does what is depicted.<br />The romance angle is tender, but never maudlin or cloying. It adds to the overall enjoyment. It does not make this film a &quot;chick-flick&quot;.<br />Sadly mauled by critics with little better to do it seems we will all have to wait a little longer to see the sign of the Saint again....

B00003CWN3|5.0|Every so often a true story makes its way to our screens. More often than not it's a tale of a battler winning against insurmountable odds, or of the way tragedy can bring a community closer. &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; is a true story of a very different kind.<br />In 1993, Brandon Teena was raped and murdered following the discovery by his friends that he was a female - Teena Brandon. Six years later the exploration of the relationships and events leading up to the murder creates one of the most uniquely rewarding cinema experiences of recent years.<br />Sitting through the film is a harrowing experience to say the least. We know the outcome - even with no prior knowledge of the story it is clear from the outset that there is no happy ending in sight - and throughout the film all we can do is wait while Brandon speeds toward his death. Frightening in its certainty, it creates a palpable tension which doesn't leave the viewer until ong after the film.<br />Hilary Swank's portrayal of Brandon is indeed a superlative performance. Her transformation for the role is complete and riveting. Chloe Sevigny - playing Brandon's girlfriend Lana - is arresting also and is likewise worthy of praise. The remaining cast (particularly the two male leads) imbue their roles with tangible dimension, creating a realism seldom found in contemporary cinema.<br />Kimberly Peirce's direction artfully reinforces the underlying themes of the work. This is the first film I've seen in which time-lapse photography is used for thematic effect rather than as a visual stunt. Peirce thankfully avoids sensationalism. Any graphic scenes are handled deftly, illustrating not only her reverence for the story but her ability to create truly visceral cinema.<br />Many will find it a torturous experience, but undoubtedly one worthenduring.<br />END
0452282152|5.0|This is a very readable and convincing story told by a (fictional) maid who works in Vermeer's house and learns some of the secrets of how he sees the world and brings it to his paintings. The book tells us much of life of domestic life in 17th century Holland from the perspective of the the 17-year old Griet who is the subject of this famous work.<br />For me, there were two very interesting things about the book. The first is that this description of domestic life tells us much about the subjects of Vermeer's paintings -- who the people were in Delft. The second is that we learn a great deal about how Vermeer painted (e.g., layered paints to give us a richer mix of colors) and even how objects were set up in his studio.<br />Griet brings a very nice sense of discovey to Vermeer's work as she understands more and more of how he achieves his effects. This helped me understand Vermeer a bit more and understand more of his wonderful art. I found myself reading this book and then going back and forth a book showing Vermeer's paintings (all 35 or so of them).<br />The book was well worth reading just for its value as an art history/art appreciation text. The book is much more than that though, in that it really tells an engrossing story a young and intelligent girl in a very realistic setting. I recommend it very highly!
B00000ILDE|3.0|I know what you're thinking, ONLY 3 STARS! Who is this guy? OK...I think Aliens is one of the best sci-fi/action movies ever made. I saw it a few times in '86 when it was in theaters. BUT..What is this obsession with adding footage and stuffing as much as you can after the fact into a DVD release. I wouldn't mind at all if they also offered a theatrical release version (The new T2 special edition is great in that it gives you both versions in the one package). I just wish they would think about the simple fact that when a movie was a huge hit like Aliens was and still is, maybe that's because they got it right the first time. Movies get edited for many reason's, pacing, scenes un-necessary to the plot or to create a certain mood etc. I rented the special edition because I was thinking about buying it and was pretty dissapointed. I did like the added scene early on where we learn of Ripley's daughter as it helps us in being behind her obsession with taking care of Newt but all the other stuff (especially the scenes of the colony before they get massacred) just ruined the atmosphere for me. In the theater you could not beat the fealing of tension or dread when the marines first enter the colony to search it. This was really blunted (on the DVD) by seeing footage of the colony and a Alien sucker before they get there. The additional footage in the latter half while not bad did make it seem not as fast paced and exciting as the original version. OK, enough of my whining. This revue is simply a cry to have the original version available on DVD as this was definitely a big enough movie to deserve the T2 treatment. If anyone out their feels likewise make your voices heard. I just want one of my favorite movies ever back. I can't buy this DVD until they cough up the original. P.S Lets hope they pull it together if they make Alien 5. The franchise is fading fast.
B00003CWTI|1.0|I dont mind filmakers taking risks - I'll take an ambitious but flawed film over the typical Hollywood grist mill anyday BUT Magnolia has got to be the worst most incomprehensible film in recent memory. The pretentiousness, overacting and sheer wwfullness of this film sets a standard that is hard to follow. The same acting contingent which gave a professional and enjoyable performance in Boogie Nights is reduced to a shrill, gasping ensemble trying to make some sense out of...nothing. Trying to pass it off as some kind of arthouse piece is the final insult to the audience which has to sit through this 3 hour mess to begin with.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I'm not really a fan of rap, but when I heard the Eminem song Stan featuring a chorus from Dido's Thankyou I got hooked to that song. When I got the song I listened to all the time and it's all so beautiful and makes you think and feel about everything. The best song on it is Thankyou, but I love all the songs.
6302862949|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, i just happened to stroll upon it while i was watching television.  However I was unable to find the title of it unitl many hours on the web searching!  I am trying to build a DVD collection so i will hold off on getting this movie until its is on that format, however this is surely a movie that deserves DVD quality!  If you like movies about other government, this is one that could keep your attention and at the edge of your seat wondering what the main character is going to do next....
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this CD, like many others, because I heard Dido's haunting voice on the Emininem record and at the end of the film Sliding Doors.  I expected to only like a few songs, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  All but a few of the songs are good, and a few are great.  I especially enjoy &quot;My Lover's Gone&quot; and &quot;Here With Me.&quot;  Dido is essentially Engalnd's answer to Sarah McLachlan--her vocal inflections are essentially the same, and she sings the same emotional, haunting lyrics.  I only hope she isn't just relegated to Gwyneth Paltrow movie soundtracks (Here with me appears on the Bounce soundtrack) and offensive rapper albums.
B00000JCOV|4.0|This album surprised me. All the media related to this band and its prominent fanbase pointed to yet another worthless, atonal, trendy mess. I had no interest in hearing this band nor did I think they had anything to offer besides spectacle (their costumes and sheer number of members) and a gimmick (they're crazy guys... from Iowa!).<br />Then I happened to see them perform on Late Night w/ Conan O'Brien (my favorite show). The stage presence and the sound of their music shocked me- but what shocked me more was that I enjoyed the song. The song, Wait And Bleed, was unexpectedly melodic with spellbinding rhythmic energy and uncompromising heaviness. Soon after this event I purchased this album and realized that Slipknot had even more to offer than what I had seen on TV. <br />The first song, (sic), was pretty standard and met my expectations of ferocious energy. The next, however, blew me away. I had a faint notion of the 'nu-metal' aspect of the band but I had no idea they would incorporate Drum and Bass into their already heady brew. Eyeless begins with a turntable scratch and then heads into a stellar, hectic drum sequence. Amazing. <br />Something to consider: there are 3 percussionists plus the programmer/sequencer in this band, which add up to an unbelievable sound. The 'main' instruments aren't particular standouts; they do their job with muscular riffs which are decent but not spectacular. The vocalist is another standout performer who is able to go from a strong singing voice to a evil-sounding growl in the space of ten seconds. Sure, you've heard it before, but not with the control he employs.<br />Overall, Slipknot aren't breaking much new ground and will surely turn off more people than they turn on. Their sound is far more extreme than most radio-friendly fare and that won't change. Hopefully Slipknot won't compromise their style to gain more widepread acceptance because it is their bizzare quality which holds most of their appeal. As I said before, theyaren't exactly pioneers, but they deserve credit for bringing a bit of flavor to a played-out genre.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I can't believe all the bad reviews this movie has. I laughed so hard I rolled on the floor in tears. C'mon people, loosen up! It's the 'Last Summer' and 'Scream' movies that were stupid. Scary Movie was by far the best comedy of the year. It's a shame some people just don't get it. Take it from me, if you like stuff like 'Airplane!' and the Naked Guns, Scary Movie is for you!
B00000IQBL|5.0|I realize most people that see this movie are not military types, but please try not to butcher every character's name and rank when you review the movie. Boot Camp is not a dehumanizing process. Far from it. By the end of boot camp, you learn to wrk together almost seamlessly, to respect and value your fellow warriors and to serve your country. <br />Why anybody would have a problem with this I don't know. If we were a bunch of robotic killing machines like we are so often portrayed to be, we wouldn't have Military police, because robots don't commit crime. There would be no brigs, jails, firing squads. And with all the veterans who leave the service every year, don't you think you would see people walking around with short hair and blank expressions on their faces and no personality whatsoever? <br />Instead, veterans are an impressive bloc of Americans who help drive this country and its economy. If you haven't served your country, don't badmouth the men who put their lives on the line everyday so that you can have your precious materialistic whims.
0393312836|5.0|I loved this book.  It is one of my favorites of all time even though I can't say exactly why.  At first this book was really hard to understand because of the language but after a few parts I began to understand it.  This book is very graphic and the movie is much worse.  This book has just about every horrible thing you can think of.  It has rape, murder, beating, betrayel, and much more.  I am glad i read this book even though my parents told me not to because of what scenes are in it. They also didn't think I would understand it but i did.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Im only 25years old but I have been listening to The Beatles since before I was born (so my father says).  I always thought it was my dad who wrote &quot;Her Majesty&quot;.  I knew the names of The Fab Four before I knew my own state Capital. This CD is a great mix of the beginning, the end and the mind provoking of The Beatles.  From the happy &quot;Love Me Do&quot; to the funny &quot;Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; you get a real sense that The Beatles struggled to find themselves as they changed their aspect of music.  What is true always, is they were geniuses with paper and pen.  The Lennon/McCartney writing is nothing but amazing.  For those out there who think that The Beatles are old, dead or long past, they forget any and almost all music is influenced by them.  This CD gives us all a piece of the pie.  It's the kind of CD to put in your car full blast and enjoy on a sunny afternoon day! 25, 52, 15 or any age, this is a CD to rejoy life with.

He has music in here that you wonder about.  He does things with sound that no one ever thought could be done.  Whether you are a Beatle Fan or not or even a McCartney Fan, this CD is a delightful journey! Wonderfully Fantastic!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Even though this CD was released in November of 1999, and it is now 2001, it is still one of my favorite CDs. It has many very good songs on it, my favorites fall among Testify, Guerilla Radio, and Sleep Now In The Fire. They all have a great guitar/bass element to them, and Zach's great lyrical talent brings up the score. Politically, RATM makes some very good points in their songs, and you begin to notice them at your 3rd times listen if you are not aware of their activity as a political rock group. I think this CD will find itself on the shelves of Rock, Pop, Oldschool and Rap fans everywhere, it has something for everyone.
B000000WJZ|5.0|From start (Cherub Rock and the distorted guitar of James Iha) to finish (Luna, a laid-back melodrama), Siamese Dream is an incredible album.<br />When people think of &quot;alterna-rock&quot;, the first album that comes to their mind is Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;.  Not to take anything away from that masterpiece, but Siamese Dream, musically, against Nevermind (without the whole Kurt Cobain mystique) is one step ahead and beyond.  Just to note, these two were both producer by Butch Vig, the premier Alt-Rock producer.<br />This album is up there with ALL of the great Rock albums of all-time, and this is in all complete honesty and truth without biased.  Siamese Dream is comparable with Led Zeppelin's IV, or AC/DC's Highway to Hell.<br />It's packed with some incredibly catchy guitar riffs of James Iha (See &quot;Geek U.S.A.&quot;; &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;), and incredibly catchy songs in general (See &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Rocket&quot;, &quot;Quiet&quot;, etc.).  The drumming of Jimmy Chamberlain is also extremely powerful throughout this album.  The angst of Billy Corgan's voice and lyrics seem to accompany the sounds of the instruments just perfectly.<br />To put it simply, Siamese Dream is a emotional rollercoaster in both lyrics, and in instruments, and it just sounds so sweet to the ears.  A must have for any Rock fan, but also a must have for any music fan.

B000051ZST|3.0|Road Trip is one of those movies that you really hope will be good, but wind up disappointed in at the end. There are about two or three bust-a-gut funny scenes, but they are not enough to redeem the rest of the movie. The actors are engaging, but they just don't have the material they need to work with.

0812589041|5.0|When I first read this book I was blown away.Never before have I read a book that had me this enthralled from the very start.I just couldn't get enough of Ender.I don't know if any other writer on the planet could match the depth of this book.It had a great plot and absolutely no slow parts.It was interesting from the beginning to the end.<br /> I'm not a huge sci-fi fan,but I don't think it would be fair to categorize Ender's Game as sci-fi.I don't think it could be categorized because it covers such a wide variety of interests and subjects.<br /> I'm not very good at writing reviews like this,but Ender's Game is such a great book that I had to try.I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes plots with a lot of depth.

B000050FEN|5.0|This movie has to be one of the best thrillers ever. You're never certain on how it'll end and it keeps the suspension up to the very end. It's a horrifying story, told in such a great way that this special edition DVD has a place in every serious DVD collection. The extra disc contained alot of great material, and the case was VERY cool!
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee sets her story in the small town of Maycolmb, Alabama. A town that has seen the worst of the depression and still sets its own rules regarding race. An interesting aspect of this story is that Lee chose to tell it through the eyes of an eight-year-old child. The lives of Scout Finch, her father Atticus, and her older brother Jem are followed throughout three hard years. Atticus is a lawyer who has got what many would call an unfortunate job of defending a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. In a town where a black man in guilty until proven innocent, this means certain punishment for Tom. Soon, young Scout and Jem are rediculed by the town's people, both themselves and their father being ripped of their dignity. Scout learns many of life's lessons in these three years of her life. There is a universal story to be told in this book. Many characters are set apart because they don't follow the norm of the town. But, Scout learns that this is not the way to live life. She learns to not flow with the rest of society at certain times, because sometimes everyone else is not always right.
B00000K31V|1.0|To watch &quot;eXistenZ&quot; was a gross waste of my money and time.  It is a cheap knock-off of &quot;The Matrix&quot;.  When I say cheap, I mean really cheap.  No visual FX at all - just some stupid silicone rubber imitation biomatter.  Bad acting, implausible plot, no visual FX.  Too bad there is no way to rate it zero stars - I would if I could.  Those people who rate it highly are afraid to admit that it sucks and that they wasted their money and time.  Who are you going to believe, me or them?  Watch &quot;The Matrix&quot; if you haven't already, and skip this cheap knock-off.

B00000I8UK|4.0|I'll be honest. What you think of this cd will depend on what sort of jazz you prefer. If you like swinging, straight-ahead blowing sessions then this cd is not for you. By the same token though, liking &quot;free jazz&quot; isn't automatically going to mean you love this cd either.<br />Freer than bop and more composed than free-jazz, this cd seems to find a middle-ground that was, and still is, largely unexplored. By &quot;middle ground&quot; I don't mean that this is a &quot;middle of the road&quot; take-it-or-leave-it cd. I mean this cd finds a spot between  bop and free-jazz that I have never heard anyone else find before. Actually, I guess I could more accurately say this cd finds a place between Mingus compositional complexity and free-jazz. You will either love this or hate it. Indifference will not be an option. Personally, I think it is great.<br />The ryhthm section of Hutcherson (vibes), Davis (bass), and Williams (drums) is something to behold. I can honestly say that this cd is the only place where I have ever heard rhythm cut up and displaced in this manner. Hutcherson seems to go from playing lead to playing blocky, chopped phrases that seem as if they may have influenced certain moments of the keyboard work on the Miles Davis album, Bitches Brew. Hubbard (trumpet) is at his best here when he and Dolphy play the heads in unison, the mixture of trumpet and alto or trumpet and bass clarinet sound fantastic.<br />Dolphy is Dolphy (and that's a compliment!). His playing here ranges from mournfully impassioned cries, to free-bop explosions of off-kilter swing. His early death really was a jazz tragedy, because on the title track and Straight Up And Down we hear what are, to me, two of the most unique compositions he ever created, and they seem to point only to his future rather than relying on his past.
6304795254|5.0|If you didn't like this movie, you should check your pulse. Take a slight grain of salt with this, and you will be on a thrill ride that is a weird blend of tender inner pain (and recovery) and car-crashing blow-up scenes. Easily one of the top &quot;off-the-beaten-path&quot; movies of all time. In a movie that has action, suspense, romantic thread (albiet weird), emotional appeal, and even a surprise ending, one would think the director went way over the top with this movie.  One would be wrong!  This and the Martix is becoming my top &quot;see-and-see-again&quot; movies! Oh ya, did I mention the surprise ending?!  Finally a surprise that actually works!
B00004YWEB|4.0|I couldn't resist writing a review for this album, as I'd only seen one on this page, and one giving it only three stars (I give this 4½ stars)! I realize that this album, along with Fly on the Wall, are considered AC/DC's &quot;Lost Albums&quot; or &quot;Weakest Works&quot; and things like that for some reason (and in all truth, Fly on the Wall probably is...but that's not to say it isn't great) but this is one of the first AC/DC albums I've ever bought, and I loved it straight from the start, and still do (I've got all of their albums!). <br />I don't know what hard rock fans couldn't like about this album. Tracks like &quot;Heatseeker,&quot; &quot;Meanstreak,&quot; (which is my favorite from this album) &quot;This Means War,&quot; and &quot;That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll&quot; really light it up. Sure, it's no Back in Black, but I think it certainly measures up with &quot;The Razors Edge,&quot; another multi-platinum album, and the one which only came a couple of years after this one. If you doubted this album before, give it a chance, man!
0131103628|5.0|I have spent way more money than I should on computer books; every cent spent on this book was worth it.  I wish that more language books followed this model.  The writing is clear, concise, and to the point.  There is a fine line sometimes between being too terse and saying just enough; for the most part the authors stay on the right side of that line.  The code samples are simple without being simplistic.  This is not a read once and throw away kind of book; I come back to it every 2-3 months and learn something new each time.
B00004YW6I|5.0|This is a very good album, possibly the best this year. It was #6 on Rolling Stone's top 10 list and #7 on SPIN's top 20 list. This album starts out with the loud, angry &quot;Big Exit&quot;, where the divine Polly Jean wails &quot;I wanna pistol/i wanna gun/i'm scared baby/i wanna run/this world's crazy/give me the gun.&quot; Next you have the much quieter &quot;Good Fortune&quot;, where she then discovers that everything's not as bad as it seems, &quot;threw my bad fortune off the top of a tall building/but i'd rather have done it with you.&quot; We keep going for a while, then we get to the painfully quiet, haunting &quot;Beautiful Feeling&quot;, and ode to her lover. Then later we have &quot;This Mess We're In,&quot; a duet with Thom Yorke, the lead singer of Radiohead. I won't keep going, but you've gotta check out track 10, &quot;This is Love.&quot; With lyrics like &quot;i can't believe life is so complex/when i just wanna sit here and watch you....&quot;, how could you not love this album?
0440234743|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - it was my first Grisham and I was skeptical, because I don't like to run to the best sellers as soon as they're out... I wait to hear friends' recommendations. Well, a friend loaned it to me and I drank it before bed every night late into the wee hours until it was done. A very interesting plot, with characters you either admire of despise.<br />Made me consider looking at other Grishams.
6301871952|5.0|this is a very good sequel to gremlins not quiet as good but not far from it the comodey is great and it has alot to do with the original unlike other sequels the leader gremlin is just as good as stripe of the first I highly suggest this film.
0385484518|5.0|Picked this book up in my death and dying phase of 1998/1999.<br />My father-in-law is afflicted with Morrie Schwartz' same illness - the syndrome that killed Lou Gherig - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.<br />This is a fantastic telling of months-long interviews Mitch Albom conducted with his quondam professor, now struggling with and dying of ALS.<br />Lessons of life and death very well written. I think I read all 192 pages in two sittings, then passed it on to my mother who did the same.
0140158766|5.0|I first bought and read Mason's book Chickenhawk in the mid-eighties. I recently got the urge to reread a number of 'Nam books, so I bought a new copy. Keeping in mind that the war in Vietnam was ever-changing, and that each time period made for a different environment, Mason gives a good account of the early period of the war. This is one of maybe the three or four best books written on the vietnam experience or, for that matter, combat flying. I recommend it highly.
0790743213|4.0|Not being one for old movies, I surprised myself at how much I enjoyed this one.  Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959) was well written, and well performed.  Other than Shirley Temple movies, there aren't many 'oldies but goodies' that can keep me from leaving to go check my voice mail, or see if the neighbors have finally shoveled their driveway.  This would also be the first movie I've seen directed by Alfred Hitchcock, so I wasn't sure what to expect, other than the fact that his name was quite familiar. I didn't even realize that it was him who missed the bus in the opening credits.             As Roger Thornhill, a man of advertisement gets pinned as a spy, he finds himself as quite the traveler; going to 9 different cities, (4 different states) to try and find out what has him caught in the nasty predicament that he's in.  As a result of this, the movie centers around Roger Thorhill himself. There are no other story lines, and very few breaks that take you away from  him.  My first thought of these kinds of movies are that they tend to drag, not moving around enough, or getting to the point quick enough.  But, Roger Thornhill's character, played by Cary Grant keeps you interested.  Not only does he keep you close to the screen, but Cary Grant has you wondering what his character's next move will be.                The story starts you out in one direction, with a scenario involving Thornhill's mom.  Oddly enough, Jessie Royce Landis, who plays the mother of Roger Thornhill, is actually two years younger than Cary Grant.  Then it takes a turn, and has you in a whole new direction.  Of course this film, as with many other movies, has you expecting a romance between the main character (Roger Thornhill) and that attractive woman (Eve Kendall) that just kind of 'pops up'.            The humor in this film is written very nicely, as well as Carried out very nicely through Cary Grant.  He has you laughing off and on throughout the wholemovie.  At points where things are getting rough for him, he'll make a funny remark that really could go either way.  In some cases it may not seem the time in the movie for the Roger Thornhill to be joking around.  But, the way he says it- I don't know if it's just his voice, or with the ease of his lines, it flows so well.  Just because the writer thinks a line or a comment is a bushel of laughs, doesn't mean it's gonna come out that way to the audience. But, it sure did in this movie.  Not to mention it's a good change in humor from the dirty filth that is present in our comedies now, without it being too corny.  It was genuine funny, which I think lacks in writing today.            Every scene was timed out nicely.  They didn't get too long and pointless.  While Thornhill was on the train, or standing in the cornfield, or bidding at the auction (which is a scene that had me laughing), the down times weren't boring. They had me wondering what unexpected thing was going to occur next.            I can't agree with my mom in saying that Cary Grant is one of my favorites actors; nor can I go along with articles and essays saying that Alfed Hitchcocks directing is one of the best of all times.  I can, though, say that I have gotten a glimpse at why  people think so positively of these two people, and I look forward to seeing more work involving the two of them.
1567184855|4.0|... it has been interesting. I've been voraciously reading about reincartnation. As with many people I was told about a book called &quot;Many Lives, Many Masters&quot; which started me down this path. I've read all of Brian Weiss's works on past-lives and have now started reading Michael Newton's books but it's going to take a bit longer. The biggest word to describe this is &quot;CLINICAL&quot;!  The author writes as though he is presenting his work to a room full of collegues rather than the average reader. Having said this, I have found his case studies extremely interesting as they serve to augment (for me) Brian Weiss's works. Brian focuses on the actual past life experience while this book focuses on the time inbetween to bring us a more complete image of our exsistance. I look foward to reading &quot;Destiny of Souls&quot;.
6305095566|5.0|A group of college kids are vacationing in the Tennessee woods, having rented a run down cabin for the weekend.  Once there, they accidentally release a host of Kandarian demons.  Then the stuff hits the fan.<br />I have several reasons for liking this movie.  The main reason is Bruce Campell.  His charactor, Ash, isn't the hero type he turns out to be in Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness.  He is much more sensitive and eaisily frightend, spending the first half of the movie letting Stevie take care of most of the dirty work.  Ash is reluctent to kill or even bury those that were once his friends, no matter what they have done to him.  Ash even cries.  He is the hero only because he isn't as brave as some others.  Not until later, anyway.<br />The second reason I love this film is the pure fright value of it.  From the first five minutes the eerieness of the movie comes through.  The special FX are generally top notch, as is the makeup (see for your self how creepy Linda looks with just a little touch up).  The end scene is one of the best FX sequences I have ever seen, and the &quot;chased by the evil&quot; effect is pretty spiffy. <br />For those of you who, like myself, prefer a good splatter every now and again, there is plenty, both from monsters and from the cabin its self.  For those that prefer to be scared silly, again like myself, Sam Raimi does a wonderful job of building suspense. The evil in the woods spends more time toying with the kids than actually killing them.  There are quite a few &quot;jump&quot; moments as well.  Even if you know the film, some of the scenes make you jump every time.  Adding to the fright are the feeling you get for the characters.  When something happens to them you find yourself going &quot;oh no, not him/her.  that can't happen to them&quot;. <br />Be warned, though, ED lacks the director's  signature humor in favor of scares.  For those of you looking for that, i highly recomend checking out the other two fims in this series.<br />For anybody who is a fan of downright horror, independent film, Bruce Campell, Sam Raimi, or movies in general, Evil Dead is an essential part of your collection.  In my humble opinion, it ties Night of the Living Dead for the greatest horror movie and cult classic ever made. Trust me.

630460291X|1.0|I found this to be the worst DVD I have purchased.  The picture is very dark and grainey.  The extras a text only, but informative.  Another problem that it is one of two DVDs I own (the other being &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; that requires me to flip the DVD over to continue the movie.  The makers of this DVD should be ashamed.  They took what good be an all-time favorite Dvd and did it cheaply.  I would recommend waiting to see if they fix the problems.
B000000OQF|5.0|I think of Appetite for Destruction as one of the biggest marketing blunders to date, because if Guns N' Roses wanted to make money, they could've split Appetite into two or three albums and thrown in some fillers, and would have sold three times as many albums.  That's the thing with gnr.  Everything they ever put out is 100% quality rock.  The only songs I don't like are My World and One In a Million (No Drumming).  But Appetite is the pride n' joy of my music collection.  Zeppelin, Metallica, Crue, AC/DC, Van Halen are all great, but nothing compares to gnr, and appetite started it all.  If Axl can't sing, one thing he can do is hold a scream forever, and I don't have to vouch for Slash.  Slash is unparalleled.  The only thing better than Slash is Slash n' Izzy.  The way Izzy weaves his rhythm in and out above and under, around and through Slash's screaming lead makes it all sound perfect.  Duff has the most melodious bass tracks I've ever heard.  The way he plays shouldn't go together with the music, but it gives it a serious third dimension.  As for the replaceable Steve Adler, as a drummer, I must say that he pulls off what no one should be able to with no tonal toms to speak of, only bare bones drums.  If you listen to this album, you can listen to each song over and over again without getting sick if it cause you can listen for each different element of the band each time.

B000002H6C|4.0|For Pete's (or anybody else's) sake, don't take the lyrics seriously, but if you have some steam to blow off, or are into lifting weights, then the unrelenting noise, the driving riffs, the screecing guitar solos, the screeming voice, and the superhuman drumming are nearly impossible to beat.  Metallica has always produced music that you can listen to on two levels.  You could sit and head bang, or you can analyze the lyrics (with a dose of a sense of humor), and then head bang.  And really, there has never been a better song title than &quot;The Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot;. Come on!
B000050X31|4.0|This very good Met production have an excelent LPCM sound; the singer aren't weak, just depend the sound mode you select. The Pamino(Araiza) and Pamina(Battle) are very good, but really good is Sarastro(K. Moll). But the DVD have an error: a poor menu, you can't select  easy( like in the Pioner Met operas DVD)the chapters, and have no other kind of related information ( the sony classical DVD ( Karajan Legacy) have it)like  singers biographies, production notes, etc. But I'm happy whit this DVD.
B000000OSE|4.0|It seems to me that the two Illusion CD's are split.  You listen to one of them depending on your mood.  Illusion 1 is harder, faster, and more lewd than the &quot;intellectual&quot; Illusion 2.  Fun songs like the cover Live and Let Die, The Garden, and Bad Apples supplement the driving rock felt in Coma, Back Off Bitch, and Don't Damn Me (I don't usually care for alot of swearing, but no one can sneak the F-word into the middle of a song and make it fit like Axl).  Axl Rose had a gift for songwriting, putting words to music and making his feeling known, from every angle (Coma, November Rain).  The only reason this is four stars and not five is that in my eyes, no body can be perfect.  There's not one bad song on this album.
B000001G16|5.0|Richie Sambora was overcome with this album. His influences from the blues show us how amazing musician and songwriter he is. With lyrics about love, soul, needs and self accomplishment, Mr. Sambora sends us to another level, where we can live just with our soul's desires.
B000000P17|4.0|Gnr ended with a cover album, and I wish they would have acted like grown-ups and stayed together, but this album is nothing to really frown upon.  GNR left their mark on the 50's with a jazzy/bluesy rendition of Since I Don't Have You.  They successfully pull off a stint in British punk with Down on the Farm and Black Leather.  I can't help but love Human Being and Hair of the Dog.  I still can't understand a word Duff says, but he pulls it off in New Rose and Attitute.  As for &quot;...Memory&quot;, Duff is the only guy I know who can sound innocent while singing the ...word.  Good song.  I would prefer an instumental version of I Don't Care About You.  I like this album becuase it was a sidestep for GNR, but they still managed to put their style into it.  For the usually low price, it is one of the best buys I've made in my music collection.

B000000OSG|5.0|I'll tell it to ya straight.  The only song on this album not worth listening to is My World, but that's at the end anyway.  Starting with Civil War, a driving, yet sad kind of ballad, it only gets better.  Gnr shows again that they have no idea how to talk to women in 14 years, and Yesterdays will pick you up some.  I've heard bad about Knockiin' On Heaven's Door, but it's good honest rock/roll.  Get in the Ring and Shotgun Blues are rather harsh, but the band regains their &quot;innocence&quot; in breakdown.  Pretty Tied Up and Locomotive have the among coolest sounding guitar rhythms of all time, and Duff sounds like and innocent kid in love in So Fine.  Estranged is purely symphonic in nature, and You Could be Mine is typical gnr.  This version of Don't Cry is outdone by the original version on Illusion 1.  In a day and age where a band can have two guitarists that sound like only one, it is refreshing to put on gnr and hear two guitarists sound like three or four.  Matt Sorum is well recieved as drummer, and Duff is one of the great rock/roll bassists of all.
6305265488|4.0|Given low expectations, no matter how well-recommended, this film can't help but succeed. It's a competent, well-made redoing of the Cinderella story, marred by a couple of narrative cliches (Cinderella's granddaughter telling the Brothers Grimm how it &quot;really&quot; happened, some petty vengeance scenes) and some throwaway lines. <br />Barrymore's luminosity shines through her limitations as an actress; every scene she's in is carried by her heartfelt performance. Angelica Huston is also brilliant as the very arch, evil stepmother. Dougray Scott is adequate as the prince, but one is grateful that he wasn't able to do &quot;Wolverine&quot; for the X-Men movie after watching this. The stepsisters were entertaining, though it was nice to see Melanie Lynskey (&quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;) again.<br />The story kind of lurches, and the throw-away lines and scenes begin to wear on the good will generated by some of the plot innovations. Still, it's a good story, with basically a good heart, and well worth watching.
B00000IOSU|5.0|This is such good stuff. Mirrorball has fast become a constant in my car and home stereos.<br />What I like about this CD is that it's not about perfection. Rather, it's about the experience. When listening to this, you feel that you're there at the concert, as the songs are infused with a great natural energy that sweeps you right up and compels you to listen.<br />Great stuff!
B00003CX95|2.0|*Braveheart*  must be an influential, if not exactly good, movie:  witness its many imitators  (*Gladiator*, even Gibson's own  *Patriot*).  For the handful who haven't seen it, it chronicles the mythic tale of William Wallace, a Scottish commoner who in the early 14th century successfully engineered a movement for independence from England.  (Well, it was really Robert I who engineered it, but in this movie the Bruce is ineffectual, to put it kindly.  You see, Gibson is portraying WALLACE.)  I'm not going to sit here and bash the film; there are so many others that are more worthy of my disdain.  Let it be said that  *Braveheart*  will remind you of those old Hollywood epics featuring a cast of thousands.  The point being, the script and characterization are just as hackneyed as any DeMille movie.  (Or any movie from the 1930's starring Errol Flynn.)  There's a Milady in the form of a French Princess of Wales.  There's a wicked King.  The characters are either all Bad or all Good, and never mind the attempt at ambiguousness e.g. Robert the Bruce.  (He's all Good.)  There's the time-honored tradition, old as Seneca, of our hero's blending of personal revenge and patriotism as motivation to fight the injustices of the wicked King.  And there's Wallace himself, who seems to be a conflation of several cliched types  (Robin Hood, The Man With No Name, Charles Bronson in those  *Death Wish*  movies, etc. etc.).  Your toleration of this movie will depend on how willing you are to tread very, very familiar paths.<br />As for Mr. Gibson's direction, it's no big deal.  Static compositions; close-ups intended to convey Meaning  (my favorite was the one where he's atop some mountain, the aerial camera delicately swooping around his tragic face); wistful scenery shots; and an excessive use of slow-motion.  In his defense, it must be stated that his battle scenes are really rather well done, inviting unsuccessful imitation  (think  *Gladiator* -- pee-yew!).  Mr. Gibson providesus three hours of all this -- his sophomoric direction, as well as his apparently sado-masochistic tendencies  (Wallace is constantly beat up throughout).  Some will find it worthwhile; some not.  I guess I'm with the latter group.
0767802659|3.0|I've lost faith in director Paul Vorhoeven.  Not only was his last flick a complete disappointment (Hollow Man) but the commentary he makes through the supplementary audio track on this DVD is rather tepid...if even that.  It is clear that Mr. Vorhoeven has focused on what this film is technically rather than what could be used as a means to explain what his directorial thoughts behind the film were.  It is, instead, left to Mr. Neumier to unpack and explain the film's underlying themes of facism and social commentary (which HE does very eloquently I might ad).  Don't get me wrong, I still like this movie very much and am not at all dissapointed in my purchase.  However, I feel that Mr. Vorhoeven's emphasis on what shots are digital and what is live and what other family member of his is involved seems a far cry from the insight given by Mr. Neumier.
B000002UUX|5.0|Dave Mustaine is a GENIUS. &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; is a perfect album that offer complicated, elaborated, and unique rhytms, riffs and solos. Songs like &quot;Holy Wars&quot;, &quot;Hangar 18&quot; and &quot;Five Magics&quot; are fascinating and &quot;sui generis&quot;. He is the &quot;Beethoven&quot; of the heavy metal.Bands like Metallica or Guns nRoses only make simple and easy songs for a public with low culture of the music of all time. If you know about all kind of music (classic, rock, wave, etc.), you have to hear this amazing album. Albums like &quot;Metallica&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; or &quot;And Justice for all&quot; are only simple music against the great masterpiece of Dave Mustaine and his band Megadeth. My rate is... 10000000... stars
B00004WIBW|4.0|The classic tale of the Headless Horseman, brought to life by Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is so believable as Icabod Crane. And Christopher Walken is the perfect choice for the Headless Horseman. The plot and story will definately keep you on the edge of your seat. Also amazing was the scenery. I kept trying to figure out if it was a built set, or special effects, or a combination. Burton has made the tale of the Headless Horseman even more frightening than you can imagine.
B000002ITG|4.0|Critics may have derided them as overblown cock-rock and Spinal Tap-esque (and if you read 'Hammer of the Gods', you'll be enclined to agree!) but Led Zeppelin remain one of the most influential rock bands ever, and the catalyst for hundreds of today's finest music. Robert Plant's lyrics, particularly on 'Kashmir' and the spellbinding 'The Rain Song', are a stunning evocation of the base elements of wind, fire, earth and rain, and this compilation contains some of the best psychedelic, oceanic rock ever...EXCEPT their are some weird choices for a greatest hits package here at the same time. It omits their best song - 'When The Levee Breaks' - a truly awesome piece of music which sums up the pure primeval energy of the best rock 'n' roll, replaced for some reason by the contrastingly inferior 'Misty Mountain Hop'. Also, we get the rather embarrasing cod-reggae of 'D'Yer Maker' (possibly their worst song ever apart from 'Boogie With Stu', thankfully not on here) and the average 'Heartbreaker' ('What Is And What Should Never Be' and 'Thank You' on the same album ['Zeppelin II'] are much better). <br />Those grudges aside, though, this is still faultless, truly transitory stuff, and possibly the best rock music you will ever hear. Anyone seriously interested in modern rock music will be lacking without this.
B00000273M|5.0|The Bangles are one of my favorites. This collection of their Greatest Hits is fantastic. If you are a Bangles fan, I highly suggest that you purchase it. <br />Theres nothing like listening to &quot;Manic Monday&quot;, &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; or &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; to bring back memories. <br />They are one of the best female bands on the scene and they created some of the best songs. This CD highlights those great songs.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke has been well reviewed here many times, soI'll keep this as short as I can.  As an animated feature: this ishands down the best that I have ever seen (granted, that's just mypersonal take on things) and I'm an animation fan of just abouteverything - Disney, Anime, claymation (I &quot;lump&quot; - bad pun,I know - Aardman Animations in here, i.e. Chicken Run, Wallace &amp;Gromit, etc.), you name it.  As a DVD: this is amongst the bestvisual experiences I have seen on DVD.  I'm somewhat biased by my loveof animation, but even so I truly think this DVD can stand up againstmany of the big-bang-DVDs out there (I have things like Gladiator,Independence Day, Fight Club).  The audio is also top notch and I'veenjoyed watching the English dub as well as the original Japanese.The 2 versions really have a very different flow and feel so to fullyappreciate Miyazaki's vision it's necessary I think to see PrincessMononoke in it's original language.  One last note - as others havealso stated, the extras are pretty minimal, but that doesn't reallydetract from this DVD very much.  There are certainly things I wouldlove to have seen included, but I won't even think about complainingdue to the quality of work shown in the transfer and the fact thatthey did finally include the Japanese language track (how many of usreviewing this signed the petition?  I'm glad I did!)  Anyone who hasnot seen this movie (doubtful if you're reading through all thesereviews :) should give Princess Mononoke a try.  Rent it, borrow it,whatever works for you.  I can't really think of anything to comparethis to so you'll just have to watch it in good faith.  All of thereviewers here that have expresses their love of this movie have doneso for good reason - Robert Ebert loved this movie, too.  Animation,Disney, anime or anything else, does not have to be cartoons for kids.Princess Mononoke proves that and should be viewed as a feature film,not an animated cartoon.
B00004U30D|5.0|A dark comedy, about suburban life. Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey give outstanding performances as a very un-happily married couple. Their lives are falling down around them, they are each having their own crisis, and everything just snowballs. Somewhere along the way, someone could have taken hold of the situation, but no one does as their lives spin out of control. Its a dark commentary on the lives of a suburban family. Wonderful performances by all the actors in the film.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Although the credits show that Dido didn't write any of the songs on the album -- the songwriting team rocks and Dido interpreted the songs quite well. There are some excellent impowering songs, great beats, soothing at the same time as grooving. ;)<br />I was totally disappointed in the first listen - but I think I was just in a bad mood. The 2nd listen I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT!! I'm still hooked!
B00003CXFU|4.0|A story about something there are so few of - real life role models. Erin Brockovich, a single mother, manages to get an entry level position in a law firm. She goes far above and beyond her job when she sees injustice being done and people being poisoned in their own homes. Certainly a situation that would be way over her head - but that doesn't stop her. She pushes forward and presses on doing what she knows is right. Yes, Brockovich does dress very unconventional, wearing low-cut blouses and short shirts. That is part of her street-wise personality. But as the story goes on, you stop noticing her inappropriate attire, and focus instead on the moral fiber and sincere convictions she has to right a terrible wrong. I highly recommend this film to women, and especially to teenage girls, as an example of what a woman can accomplish when she sets her mind to it.
0790729369|2.0|I gave it two stars because of the outstanding performances of Streep and Eastwood, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  So!  It seems many reviewers went through boxes and boxes of Kleenex tissue while watching this movie.  I found the story line quite sobering and depressing.  Francesca has been married for twenty years or more to a faithful husband who loves her, and while he is away on a camping trip with the kids, lo and behold, she plays tiddly-winks behind her husband's back with a roaming, divorced photographer because she is bored with her existence.  Well, isn't that a shame!  What happened to her vows, &quot;Until death do us part?&quot;  The plot was so inane, it was embarrassing.<br />And what a legacy she left for her kids!  She recorded her affair.  Please!  I would rather not have seen the film.  It left me feeling not too good about the human race.
B00005613Q|5.0|A great album for Jeff Beck fans.  Most of the songs establish a groove and then work it from there.  The guitar playing from Beck is very entertaining and heavy.  This album was easy to get used to right out of the box and on repeated plays it gets better and better.  Some of the interplay reminds me of Miles Davis at his funky best.  I think this album is even better than the previous &quot;Who Else ?&quot;.  I'm so glad Jeff Beck made this CD.
6304383827|5.0|Classy.  Flawless.  Triumphant.  All words that can be used to describe the film &quot;Emma.&quot;  This educational love story turned out to be one of the most appealing matchmaking films that I have even seen.   Everyone, including characters and readers alike, seem to be taken back in awe of Emma's desirability, complexity, and purity, in part due to the appeal of the essential English image being portrayed.  Emma, in general, comes off as a simple woman, but by looking deeper, it can be seen that she is a complex woman who is genuine, affectionate, and altruistic, while at the same time selfish, mislead, judgmental, and myopic.  This all adds up to the woman as a whole and is what makes the story interesting.   &quot;Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match.&quot;  This seems to be the phrase that continuously echoes in Emma's head.  Love will always find a way, but to Emma, it must be her way or no way.  This is her one greatest downfalls - the fact that &quot;she&quot; is blind, rather than the love.  Emma is convinced that men know nothing about their hearts when, in actuality, it is she who knows nothing about her own.  She is convinced that her judgment is always correct, but unfortunately, she is fool-heartedly misunderstanding of everything.  Could this possibly be because she has never loved before?  Is this an unconscious self-defense?  One will never know and may only speculate.   All of Emma's undesirable qualities are eventually dealt with tactfully - in the form of Mr. Knightley.  He is the one voice of reason in the film, and without him, Emma may never have been able to grow to be the extraordinary woman that she is capable of being.  Knightley sees Emma for what she is and for what she is capable of achieving, understanding both her foolish aspects and also her good heart - the aspect that is readily apparent and which wins everyone's charm.  Yet, Knightley realizes that Emma must grow as a person - exactly the point of the movie - and hides his feelings for fear of endangering his friendship with Emma.  Eventually, love wins him over though and he realizes that in order to help her, he must reveal his love for her.  In short, he realized that he must take advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity before it was too late, no matter what the cost may be to himself, for women like Emma are few and far between.   Every other character in the film represents some sort of aspect as love in its entirety.  For instance, Emma's father is the male figure that fulfills every positive quality that Emma searches for in a man - whether it be for friends, such as Harriet or Mrs. Taylor/Weston, or for herself.  This represents somewhat of an electra complex in the film (the daughter desiring a man with her father's qualities).  Emma's major problem though is that she judges people initially at the surface and does not allow herself to be open to the qualities that may fulfill her needs.  Although Mr. Knightley may be perfect for her, she does not realize this until she allows herself to open up to love, experience it, and be truly loved.  This is the sign of maturity that Mr. Knightley had hoped and waited for and also that which he will be forever thankful.   &quot;Emma&quot; as a whole was an exceptional film in which maturation, deception, selfishness, sincerity, and ultimately love played major roles.  In its entirety, &quot;Emma&quot; offers a wide array of aspects of love that are revealed in a timely fashion throughout the movie.  Only through this meticulous process may Emma - the mislead, selfish girl - mature into Emma - the headstrong, altruistic woman.  Although Emma may never achieve the perfection in Mr. Knightley's eyes as she does in those of her friends, - which is not necessarily a negative aspect, for then it would not be true love - she does manage to capture the hearts of the audience and enables the film to be as near to perfect as it may possibly be.
B000002NJS|5.0|I have every CD by Madonna and this remains my favorite because  her voice is REALLY herd and the songs themselves are among the best ever written.  You will enjoy!!
B00000BKE1|4.0|Not a bad album at all. Sure it isn't Iron Maiden's greatest album but I think it's pretty damn good and is pretty consistent. It is heavy hitting and you will stay listening throughout the album. Some of the best songs on the album are &quot;Be Quick Or Be Dead&quot;, &quot;Afraid To Shoot Strangers&quot;, &quot;THe Fugitive&quot; and &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;. The album is definetly worth getting and you will enjoy it.
B00004XONN|4.0|First of all, I think it's funny that Microsofties are listed among the leading purchasers of this record. Such irony.<br />Though I think this is a commendable left turn, I don't think that this record will endure as the masterpiece some are portraying it to be. It's simply too derivative to hold up as a groundbreaking, pivotal moment.<br />That said, this is a compelling record. I LOVE the fact that they're smart enough to thumb their nose at the establishment without the slightest trace of pretense or bombast. They continue to mess with conventions. Be it song, industry, social evolution, etc. etc. They've managed to keep their audience guessing and, more impotantly, engaged in ideas that challenge rather than pander. That's the ultimate compliment that they can pay to us. The fact that they pre-released Kid A only further underscores their commitment to the listener. This ethic, in and of itself, confirms their place as one of the most important bands around today.<br />I only wish that this record took MORE chances. Having said that, it's packed with enough good (if not revolutionary) ideas and incomparably beautiful moments (thanks to Yorke's voice) to recommend it.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|Without a doubt one of Iron Maiden's best albums. It is very heavy hitting and has some great songs on it. This album will keep you pumped the whole way through. From Moonchild through Only the Good Die Young this is the album to buy. Some of the real good songs on the album are &quot;Can I PLay With Madness&quot;, &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;, &quot;Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son&quot;, &quot;The Clairovoyant&quot;, &quot;Only The Good Die Young&quot; and all the other ones are real good too but those are the top songs on the album. This is definetly one of there best albums and definetly worth getting if you dont have it.
B00000JG41|5.0|Yeah, THIS is music. This is ALL KINDS OF MUSIC. Stuck together in one big, gunky package....with a human brain jammed on top as a bow. The music on here is not genre-bound, and no other band sounds anything like anything on here. I mean, even the segments influenced by other genres of music seem....independent of those Genres. Ars Moriendi, None Of Them Knew They Were Robots, Air Conditioned Nightmare, and Goodbye Sober Day are the most crazed pieces of music I have ever heard (With Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz from Disco Volante in there too.) I remember, when I asked my cousin what kind of music these people were, back before I became indoctrinated: &quot;They're....Mr. Bungle.&quot; There truly is no classification for the brilliance contained herein, and, if you are diverse, crazed, angry, sad, happy, all of the above, or even NONE of the above, get this disc. You will either love me or hate me for saying this, but oh well. This is true Ars. Ars Moriendi, to be exact.
B000002UWP|5.0|...with Crash! Boom! Bang!, Joyride is the best Roxette's album. Songs like the title-track or &quot;Knockin' on every door&quot; can't be real, they are too beautiful! And listen to the last song, &quot;Perfect Day&quot;... I cry everytime I listen to it! Bye!
6301735048|4.0|As you will read in other reviews, yes this movie is violent, but, it is not gratuitous. Stowe and Costner chemistry works. The movie well cast,the cinematography is beautiful and the music/soundtrack is interesting. Check it out.
0792156684|4.0|TITANIC was BEAUTIFUL.  <br />The fact that some of the footage was of the actual sunken ship added to the initial impact of the movie.  When watching the movie, you feel like you are on TITANIC as you witness the beautiful woodwork, carpet and clothing of that time-period.  The acting was overall a success.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were excellent and you get a general idea of their personalities.<br />However, even though this movie was an amazing technical masterpiece, historically accurate for the most part and well acted, there are some parts to the movie which were completely unnecessary.  This includes, nudity, sexuality, and language.  For these reasons, I recommend that you have the &quot;fast-forward&quot; button handy during family viewing of this movie.  This movie was excellent, but could have been even better if these scenes had been omitted.  <br />Enjoy this movie with your family, but keep that remote handy.:)
6305013578|2.0|When I bought this DVD, I was actually expecting less-than-perfect picture quality.  After all, $10 for a DVD is cheap.  I reasoned it would at least have some version of the movie on it, and thus it's worth the money.  But now, having watched it, I'm not convinced.<br />There are no issues with tinting/no tinting, new score/old score.  Here it's just that the transfer is downright painful to watch -- grainy, scratchy, at times out of focus, at times so dark you can barely see the action.  The gorgeous production design and innovative filmmaking is buried under layers of artifacts from a bad transfer.  It looks like someone videotaped it off of a TV (using a camcorder through a dirty window), then watched the tape about twenty times, then put it on the DVD.<br />I know, the film's 80 years old, we can't expect a pristine presentation.  But I know that better transfers exist, I've seen them on VHS.  Not to mention the fact that The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu have beautiful Criterion DVDs -- why haven't they done Metropolis yet?  Surely a film that influenced everyone from Ridley Scott to George Lucas deserves preferential treatment.<br />The sound is good, a full orchestra instead of just a piano, but that's about all this sad little disc has going for it.  If you want to see Metropolis (and everyone should see it at least once), you're better of getting it on VHS for now.
0064407667|4.0|In a recent assignment, my son reviewed &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;:<br />The story of the Baudelaire orphans is a tragic one, telling the miserable tale of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny (the orphans), who lose their parents in a fire that destroys their home and all of their possessions and are then sent to live with the ominous Count Olaf. The Count plots to take control of the entire Baudelaire fortune, while treating the children very poorly, making them do all sorts of chores and providing them horrible living conditions.<br />The book had its ups and downs. For example, I thought the narrator's definitions and repeated warnings that the book was \\"very sad\\" were annoying, not funny (as I think the author intended). I didn't find \\"The Bad Beginning\\" that sad, probably because I'm a boy. Sure, it must have been pretty sad for the kids to learn that their parents had been charcoaled like hotdogs. But, to me, the book was intended to be read the same way you watch old silent movies (I saw some for the first time this summer ... neat stuff!): knowing it's funny because it's an exaggeration. I'm not putting the book down; don't get me wrong. I plan to read the rest of the series. One of its \\"ups,\\" by the way, was that the orphans' ideas were really cool....<br />When I shared my opinion of the book with my mom, who is also reading the series, we discussed how the book is actually plot-driven, not character-driven ... meaning, the focus is on what happens to the Baudelaire orphans, not who the Baudelaire orphans are. When you're done reading, you don't \\"know\\" Violet, Klaus, and Sunny the way you know Harry, Ron, and Hermione (from the Harry Potter series, of course), for example.<br />Anyway, if you're looking for a quick, fun read, try this.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD is excellent.  Period.  The people that don't like it ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LIKE IT because it does not cater to their tastes.  The lyrics ARE NOT, I repeat, ARE NOT supposed to be &quot;intelligent&quot; or &quot;deep&quot;.  The intro says it all:  this is not a test---this is reality.  The lyrics and song contents are simple takes of Fred's view on his reality as it stands right now.  The band is fantastic and provides all the straight-forward no-nonsense in your face music that Limp Bizkit is all about.  They are very talented---they don't need to play monotonous solos or write self-indulgent pseudo-profound lyrics like other flashy bands who ARE NOT REALITY BASED.  So lighten up and just enjoy the blasting riffs, pinpoint bass, great beats, and cool scratches.  The songs themselves are also very gratifying and extremely enjoyable, especially if partying or driving or just hangin' out.  What more could you ask for???  Thanks Fred, Wes, John, Sam, and Lethal for keeping it straight...
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|Every genre has it's spoof so it should come as no surpirse that 'Scary Movie' was made.  If not for the writing talents of the Wayan's Brothers it could have been much worse, but at least it manages to be entertaining.  The DVD offers some nice behind the scenes footage and deleted scenes which make purchasing the film worthwile.  All in all, it's worth purchasing (if you have a coupon).
0790736233|5.0|Based on a novel by the late, great Carl Sagan, &quot;Contact&quot; follows the course of events that lead up to a faith-shaking experience in agnostic scientist Ellie Arroway's career.   Spurred on to succeed by the death of her father, Ellie embarks on the proverbial &quot;search for intelligent life&quot;, and indeed encounters some on terra firma in the form of Palmer Joss (played by dashing Matthew McConnaughey).  The two meet up later in Washington after Ellie discovers a pattern of prime numbers sent back from the Vega system.  A great maelstrom of excitement ensues when streams of data are decoded (Ellie is surreptitiously aided by an eccentric millionaire called Hadden) and the blueprints for some great machine come through.  The next conflict is, who gets to go...well, we know who it eventually turns out to be, and for all her doubts in a higher power, Arroway now faces the challenge of scrutiny when the time she has spent &quot;away&quot; from earth doesn't jive with the events experienced by everyone else. Interesting philosophical overtones, and the question of &quot;Are we alone in the universe&quot; are subtlely asked in this film.  Wisely, they only tweak our interest and we are left wondering for ourselves about the infinite possibilities and secrets the universe holds.
0385487339|5.0|An artillery officer who wrote nothing else of note wrote this book to propagandize his theory that women should be allowed education. One of the cornerstones of the history of the novel. An epistolary novel, which gives De  Laclos a wonderful chance to exercise a variety of styles and voices. A story of erotic vengeance. Full of provocative moral and gender relation questions. Several movies and an opera are based on it. The recent movie with Glenn Close is very good.
B000002UJQ|5.0|i love this album for the sheer reason that i enjoy it more and more with every listen.  i might have owned it for three years, but each time i listen to it i find something new, hear something a bit differently, make a different connection, hear a new harmony.  radiohead is phenomenal and this album proves their incredible musical talent and ability to see into the future and produce a really unique record.
B00003W8NM|5.0|(you'll get the title after you see the movie) OK, first off, Fight Club isn't really about the fighting. That's not the focus of the movie. What it's really about is two guys who devise a plan to f**k up the system - support groups, gigantic corporations, purchasing things we don't need, celebrity status, etc.  Basically, the narrator (Edward Norton, whose character's name isn't given) is an insomniac with a fix for Swedish furniture. He's a businessman who's frequent traveling drives him insane. He goes to support groups for cancer, AIDS, etc. despite the fact that he has no disease. He then meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman. When the narrator's condo is blown up, he goes to live with Tyler, who basically has a grunge against current society, and the fight club spins out of control from there, and eventually evolves into something called Project Mayhem... <br />The DVD's great. It's ironic, that, despite the subject of the movie, the second disc has just about every piece of promotional material that you could ever want or care to see. My favorites are of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton giving public service announcements. The first disc, in addition to the movie, has four commentary tracks, the most interesting being the one between Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter (it also explains why they had to beat up a Volkswagen Beetle...). There's some interesting deleted and alternate scenes, including one line Marla says that was quickly cut out, but after one viewing, you won't be surprised that these were cut out. There's also some stuff about how they made that house that you'll want to see afterwards.
B00003CX8J|4.0|Marvel comics does not have the best track record when it comes to translating their popular comic book characters from the page to screen.  I am happy to say that that trend has finally been broken with the release of 'X-Men' on DVD.  While not entirely true to the mythos of the comic books, 'X-Men' presents the characters as realisticly as possible while keeping the message of tolerance and acceptance at the core.  The cast embodies each character with their core qualities from the vicious savagary of Sabertooth to the exotic beauty and grace of Storm.  As a film it is entertaining, as a DVD it is a treat!  A wonderful array of extras awaits you to explore within the colorfully graphic menu found within Cerebro.  I personally enjoyed Hugh Jackman's screentest and the extra scenes that did not appear in the original release (which can be viewed during playback of the movie or as separate scenes).  I love this DVD!
B000050IMG|2.0|Oh, man, were the Wayans brothers way off the mark with this one. Slapping together parodies of &quot;Scream&quot; and the &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; flicks, and even the whole &quot;Whazzup&quot; catch-phrase, I guess they thought it would make for humorous cinematic fodder.  The bits were tired, perhaps because they were so lame in the original movies, and the whole deflowering of the Cindy character was handled in such a tasteless, unfunny manner.  The one good thing about this whole waste of celluloid was that the Carmen Electra character got killed off way before she had a chance to annoy us with any further character development.  Oh, yeah, she totally had to be in her underwear when she got slammed upside the head with a car windshield.  I guess that was pretty funny.  Save your money.  Go in a different direction.  Far away from this one.
B00004YW6I|3.0|Remember how great Patti Smith was before she decided she was a beat poet--back when she wrote actual songs, that were played on actual guitars, by actual rock and roll musicians?<br />Well, throw in a better sense of melody and the ability to hold it all together over the course of a CD, and that's the closest approxiamation I can come up with for PJ Harvey.<br />The woman who wrote &quot;Sheila Na Gig&quot; and then pummeled college radio with it--one of the few true rock records of the last 10 years--does so much on each song on this CD.  &quot;One Line&quot; and &quot;Kamikazi&quot; are my personal faves, but the whole thing shakes, sometimes like a bad dream, sometimes like a roller coaster.<br />PJ is what a lot of lesser acts--and even a few great ones, like U2 and latter-day Pretenders--try to be.  She's brave and sexy and funny and smart and has more to do with rock than Blur or Oasis or Radiohead can even dream about.
B000000WZ4|5.0|one day i was  sat in front of the TV , watching MTV (as usual ) then i saw for the first time a video that move me. and talk to me it was BARREL OF A GUN  in the first time it was nice the next time it move me and like i was saying talk to me  i have never liked rock or any of that (an Elctronic Music Freak ) . then i sent my mom one day form work to buy me the Album ULTRA . April 1998  and i sat and look at the front cover !  then i listen to it  it was Elctronic yet Dark (not to dark )  yet soft with vocals  that much  i listen to it  all Night and never got enough of it it is  still my  favorit DM  cd.
0375420525|3.0|I've only just started reading House of Leaves and can't really give an accurate review, but I did want to note that Mark Danielewski's sister is Poe, whose cd Haunted is a companion piece to the novel.  In fact, I only heard about the novel after buying the cd, and then grabbed the book when I spotted it at the library.  If you've heard Poe's music, then you know that she's a talented musician with an incredible voice.  Her first cd Hello is a must-have, and while Haunted is quite different, it's no less brilliant.  If you liked the book, I recommend getting the cd as well.
0140177396|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Everything from Lonnie's mental disability to the punishing of Candy for his age made me feel anger, pain, and resentment towards people with such prejudice. If you have ever wanted to know what a true friend was like you have to read this book. The friendship between these two men are unbelievable. Steinbeck is one of my favorite author's because of this particular book. This book shows how Steinbeck has a steadfast refusal to allow &quot;celebrity&quot; become a roadblock to his only real ambition, to be a writer. With the emotions and realism in this book i would say Steinbeck has really accomplished his dream of being a successful writer.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido has an amazing voice, she rights her own music and sounds just as great acoustic live as on her album.  This is real music to celebrate!  Forget all those flash in the pan boy bands and brittney, mandy, jessica pretty faces, but no talent groups and listen to real talent!  BUY THIS CD- thanks to Craig Kilborn who introduced me to her!
6304286961|5.0|This is a great movie about one of my favorite bands of all time, The Doors! and their deceased lead singer, the great Lizard King poet Jim Morrison. i thought this movie was really good even though it wasnt 100% accurate. i think Oliver Stone and all the actors did the best they could in making this movie, and it came out really great. Jim lives on! RIP<br />P.S.- if you liked this movie you should also check out the book Angels Dance and Angels Die, which is about Jim and Pam and their romance.
6305537313|5.0|I am a huge fan of Audrey Hepburn.  This is strange because the first time I even saw any of her movies was this last year. Breakfast at Tiffany's and Wait Until Dark are my two favorites. See them and as many other Audrey Hepburn films as you possibly can!
B000002J2D|4.0|And Then There Were Three is Genesis' last great album. With the departure of Steve Hackett, the band began to distance itself from its progressive rock roots and adopted a more single-oriented, radio-friendly sound. Not a bad call, it seems, judging by the sales figures that soared on the back of this new direction.  And even though And Then There Were Three can still be essentially classed as a classic Genesis album (with wide-screen anthems such as Deep in the Motherlode, Ballad of Big, and Lady Lies) the songs are a bit shorter, the lyrics more &quot;accessible&quot;, the tunes more car stereo-friendly. A far cry from Nursery Cryme.  Skip the execrable &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;, however, and you have a highly listenable album; very keyboard-heavy, wall-of-sound, which isn't a bad thing, if you ask me.
B00000J7S8|5.0|This CD is what you need when you are trying to escape the every day madness. Increadible performance and arrangement. Great stress releiver.<br />Thanks, Ana Holz
B000002O06|5.0|There are so many great songs from &quot;Second Helping&quot;, Lynyrd Skynyrd's sophomore album, that it's extremely difficult to pick a favorite. &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; is sweetly scintillating with its opening guitar riff. &quot;Call Me The Breeze&quot; will take you on the ultimate rock 'n roll ride of a lifetime with Southern references like &quot;I Dig You Georgia Peaches&quot;. &quot;The Needle And The Spoon&quot; somewhat delves into the band's experimentation with various drugs, yet is still a hard-rocking, enjoyable number, as are all the songs on the album. &quot;Workin' For MCA&quot; is perhaps the first song with a record label in its title. MCA is also the label which Skynyrd recorded for throughout much of the band's heyday in the '70's and early eighties when the already disbanded Skynyrd split ranks and reformed as &quot;The Rossington-Collins Band&quot;. The most touching song from &quot;Second Helping&quot; is &quot;The Ballad Of Curtis Loew&quot;, a blues-tinged number that tells the story of a blues legend from the Old South (not the Confederate South!) who played strictly for the love of (his) music. &quot;Don't Ask Me No Questions&quot; is also one of the top selections here. With so many good songs to choose from, you'll be back for third and fourth helpings! With the fact that &quot;Second Helping&quot; was also produced by blues master Al Kooper, this makes this Southern-rock masterpiece a must buy for any Skynyrd and Al Kooper fan!
B0000025C0|4.0|I've been a longtime Boston fan (who ISN'T?) and I bought their first record on cassette and literally wore it out after listening to it so often...yes, it is THAT good.  But what does a band do to follow up one of the MOST successful debut albums of all-time??  Good question.  Record exec's are notorious to strike while the music is hot...and if that means sacrificing the music and sometimes the ultimate success of the band, so be it.  Ever notice how many people who win the Grammy for best new artist never go on to repeat their initial success?  This is a perfect example of the sophomore curse in the music business... B-u-u-u-u-t Boston, although under pressure to get their next album out ASAP did an admirable job of producing a fairly good follow-up.  But again, remember that their 1st LP was (and still IS) one of the greatest selling debut records in music history... comparing 'Don't Look Back' under those circumstances is totally unfair, and I have always maintained that Boston never received the respect they deserved.<br />From track #1 Boston never did 'Look Back' and they moved forward and I have to say that based on its OWN merits, is an above-average example of great rock &amp; roll.  Who can argue that 'A Man I'll Never Be' and 'Party' aren't great tracks that stand toe-to-toe with anything on their first album?  How 'bout 'Feelin' Satisfied'?  Listen again WITHOUT judging it against record #1 and you will be very surprised at how great this follow-up album really is.  All I want is for folks to stop being so critical of a great rock band and ultimately a great CD.
B00004XOWM|2.0|What the hell did happen.  I'll tell you what did happen.  People got tired of listening to their whinny, cut you down(NIN would chew their little wimp asses heads off any day, and no one can talk about women that way, especially not Fred Durst), swear every two beepin' seconds cause i don' beepin' know what other intelligent lyrics to write.  The only reason I gave this CD 2 stars is because of 4 songs.  Take A Look Around, My Way, Boiler, and the One.  I like these songs because they actually have a sense behind them and have good instrumental.  There are 11 reasons why I hate this CD. Intro, Hot Dog, My Generation, Full Nelson, Rollin(air raid vehicle), livin' it up, getcha groove on, it'll be ok, hold on, rollin'(urban assault vehicle), outro.  Play the fuckin' track, oh there it is. BANG!!!! That is the single stupidest thing that I have ever heard on a CD.  Fred could actually rap on Sig. Others, and N 2 Gether now was a very good song, but the two rap songs on this CD are totally unbearable.  They both suck, just like most other rap.  The only thing that has improved on this CD os the instrumental, and it is a sorry thing that moron Durst put it behind his huge, over grown and sold-out ego, and hide the only good thing on the CD. Maybe their next CD will include the good from all three and actually create a really good rapcore CD.  Until then I have the first two Bizkit albums, and Papa Roach, and Linkin PArk to easily hold me off, and if they never bring out another CD, OH DARN!

B0000025FG|5.0|Ive heard critics and fans alike dismiss this album as being &quot;blatantly commercial&quot; and it kind of confuses me.  It seems unfair that if a piece of music becomes incredibly popular it's branded as &quot;commercial&quot;, kind of like what happened to Nirvana.  Any hoo...after re-listening to my ELO catalog recently (after being untouched for a few years) this album sounded the most fresh and consistant.  Every song has well crafted melodies and is enjoyable, which is something the other records lack.  Mostly every ELO album is about the same, killer opening 2 tracks, followed by slower numbers, a decent side 2 opener, more slow tunes, and then a slam bang finale.   This album falls into that pattern as well, but the &quot;filler&quot; songs are much higher quality than the average ELO album (with the exception of New World Record).  I also think its unfair that others have labeled this a disco album.  It's really not.  Shine a Little Love and Last Train to London have disco-esque bass lines for sure, but the rest of the album is straight up, standard ELO.  I really enjoy this album and would recommend this as one of the first ELO albums to buy if you are new to the group.  Dont Bring Me Down, ELO's best single ever (in my opinion anyway) justifies owning this album.
0399146253|5.0|After Point of Origin, I was a bit worried about the last two Scarpetta novels that continued the saga.  Black Notice managed to revive my interest, and Last Precinct is keeping me fairly well interested.<br />I understand a lot of reader's complaining about Kay's tendency to wallow in self-pity, and the fact that the plots aren't quite what they used to be, and I'll admit I've been disappointed with a few things.  But come on guys.  Life changes, we change, and unfortunately our favorite characters change.<br />Change is what The Last Precinct is all about.  Several shocking changes, in fact.  Our favorite medical examiner is closing a door on one aspect of her life, and moving on, possibly, to brighter horizons.<br />Yes, all of our favorite friends and enemies are here, just not as much in the spotlight as usual.  We see a new side of several of them, and I think this novel was more a bit of soul-searching on Kay's part that we get to snoop in on.<br />The plot was a twisting, turning maze, and I was well satisfied by the mental tension, even though the action was a bit more toned down.  I was surprised when the &quot;bad guys&quot; are unmasked, and a few connections caught me completely unaware.  That isn't the true end of the story, however.<br />The purpose of Last Precinct is to prepare us for Kay's complete life change, and personally, I think it's about time.  I won't give it away, but hopefully Kay is branching out, and we will see her personal relationships become much heathier and more meaningful in the future.  Even if it's for only one more book.<br />So, would I recommend it?  Yes, to long-time Scarpetta fans.  Not so much to newcomers, as there is too much change and you might get lost.  The last few books have really been meaningless unless you have the background necessary to know who's who.  Overall, I enjoyed it, and I think it's worth the time.
B000007T1M|5.0|This is my second all time favourite CD.  After Soulfly's debut CD.  This CD is a non-stop listen.  I must ask, what was Serj on when he wrote the lyrics.  Some of them make no sense, while others are powerful.  The quality of the music is legendary.  Nothing is wrong on this CD.  The guitar and vocals are great, and the drums are thankfully kept in the backround when necesarry.  The lyrics are funny, and make you think.  If I ever stop listening to this CD it is because it's the third time in a row that I heard it, or I am going somewhere.  All the songs are great and I really, really love Spiders.  When they bring out a new CD I will be happier than I have been in a long time.(or since christmas, either one works)
B000002WYT|4.0|What is it that makes this band so successful? Is it the intensity and raw honesty of the lyrics, or is it the unrivalled drumming of Carter Beauford, or maybe it's just the quirky pseudo-American-South African voice of Dave Matthews himself?<br />All of the above.<br />It sees the band move on from the tremendous &quot;Under the table and dreaming&quot; to come up with arguably their best song in &quot;Crash into Me&quot;.  The truthfulness and almost naive honesty in the lines &quot;I watch you there through the window and I stare at you, you wear nothing but you wear it so well, tied up and twisted the way I like to be&quot; make this a work of art. <br />There are many other gems on this album: &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; sees Matthews return to his South African roots and &quot;Let You Down&quot; gives a sincere and beautiful apology for indescressions past.<br />If nothing else, buy this for &quot;Crash into Me&quot;. &quot;You've got your ball you've got your chain, tied to you tight, tie me up again. Who's got their claws in you my friend?&quot; Music and poetry do not get better than this!
B0000025DT|5.0|No question, this is the strongest of ELO's albums.  I also think it is one f the most overlooked albums of the rock-era.  You'll never see this one on any top 100 lists, even though it deserves to be at least in the top 40.  This album is the perfect combination of Lynne's melodies, mixed in with some good old rock and roll with a solid orchestral backing.  Lynne uses the orchestra to create these songs and carry many of the melodies, whereas other artists use the orchestra simply to complement or back up a song.  Anyone with an interest and vintage 70's rock, or just great music in general ought to give this masterpiece a shot.  How could a man like Jeff Lynne who was such a monster creative force be forgotten so quickly like he has?  It's really an injustice.
B000002UAX|5.0|If you are one of those people who think that that you would NEVER listen to a Beatles song..Well, get ready to listen to 30 of them.   once you start, you can't stop.  Their music is such an addictive thing.  They are so talented (which goes without saying) and have such a range of musical intellect.  You clearly hear that on this album.I started listening to Beatles music in Jr, high and have been a fan for at least 20 years.   I didn't benefit by being around when they were together as a group ( more like being born during)  so albums and old videos were all that I had.  For those of you who were able to witness the history that became the Beatles, I am sure that you know how lucky you are.    <br />For someone just getting to know the Beatles, this is  the one to start collecting with.  Revolver, Stg, Pepper and Abby Road are good seconds.
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought this cd after hearing some glowing word-of-mouth comments about it.  I haven't stopped listening to this cd since I got it!  This is the perfect soundtrack for those who pine away for that certain someone, for those who have had their heart ripped out, for those who just feel like wallowing in misery for awhile, or even for those who just really dig British rock like me.  The songs are all amazing.  &quot;Don't Panic&quot; is one of my favorites- I actually wish it were a longer song, I like it so much!  &quot;Shiver&quot; is heartwrenching in its' honesty- every time I listen to it, I know what he's feeling.  Also check out the beautiful &quot;Trouble&quot;, &quot;Sparks&quot;, and &quot;Yellow.&quot;  A lovely, aching album.
0684853523|5.0|I have just finished Stephen's book on writing.  I cannot say stongly enough how enlightening and inspiring I found every word.  The book is not merely a how-to.  Instead it is a picture of an author.  His struggles, his successes, and his triumphs are so apparent on every page.  More than that, I did not feel as though I was miles and miles from Bangor reading words written three years ago.  I felt as though I was sitting in Stephen's den, office, back hallway, and he was sharing the elements of his life with me.  <br />I devoured with relish each page and took mental note of all advice.  I associatiated with many of Stephen's writing methods.  I wanted to hug him and tell him I was so glad to know he survived such a devastating accident and returned to his family, his intimate family and his reader family.  What's more, I made a firm plan to do what I have evaded for so long. WRITE!
B000002KKS|5.0|After the Ozzy era in Black Sabbath, most people lost interest in Sabbath, thinking that the band could never top the success that they achieved with their former frontman. However, Sabbath answered to all the &quot;non-believers&quot; by recruiting former Rainbow frontman Ronnie James Dio. The result of this was Heaven and Hell. H&amp;H still features Tony Iommi's distinct guitar style and the pounding rythm section of Geezer Butler and Bill Ward but takes on a whole new dimension with the vocals of Dio. Songs like &quot;Children of the Sea&quot; and &quot;Neon Knights&quot; are mystical tales of the unknown that Dio would eventually become well-known for in his solo career. The song &quot;Lonely is the Word&quot; is a great ending for this album because of it's power. However, the highlight of this album is by far the title track. When Iommi plays that first power chord you can tell the song is going to kick .... The song then goes into a fast ending after the guitar solo and ends with the calm sound of an acoustic guitar similar to the likes of &quot;Fluff&quot; from the bands &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot; album. To sum it up I will say this: Whoever thought Sabbath couldn't rock without Ozzy should not be a Black Sabbath fan.
6305750750|3.0|The major failings of this film are 1: We all know how the story ends, and 2: It isn't an entire film unto itself.  It's like the first half of a miniseries, or a premier episode of a tv show.  It doesn't have the strength to stand alone the way the other Star Wars films do.  The dissapointment with this film sprang primarily from the absence of a satisfactory ending. But Spawn did that to me as well. I still saw it again, and I don't complain. Why?  Because it's PRETTY.  I like pretty things.  If you want a powerful plot, brilliant acting, intense action it's not here. It's not in Spawn either for that matter. But if you want to look at something pretty that doesn't tax your brain this is a brilliant, detailed taspestry of vibrant colour. You can watch it again and again and see new things every time. It's not a work of cinematic genius, Lucas leaves that to Kubrick (rest his soul) but it's really really pretty, and you don't have to think about it, just look at it.  Furthermore, the special effects advances that all four existing Star Wars films (and Spawn) have inspired or downright produced allow other directors can make better, more mentally taxing, awe inspiring, films with storylines and dialogue.  (here is where I rant about how instumental George Lucas has been in the advancement of SFX technology) <br />The third major failing of this film is that there's no girl Jedi knights.

This is a captivating love story.  After reading it you'll be haunted by the face of the Girl with the Pearl Earring and want to buy a print of her portrait to frame or a miniature version to carry in your wallet.
B000006ZPY|4.0|In the decade of the 1980s Black Sabbath was pretty much in ruins. Original members Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler, and Bill Ward were all gone, leaving Tony Iommi to run the band on his own. The band had gone through an endless number of personal changes which included Ronnie James Dio, Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, and Ray Gillen. Iommi finally decided to stay with Tony Martin for 1987's Eternal Idol. Headless Cross was the first album that Martin totally made with the band(considering that most of the songs on Eternal Idol were credited to Ray Gillen). The band consisted of Martin, Iommi, Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray, and Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell. Headless Cross was by far the best Martin-era Sabbath album. Some of the highlights of the album are the goth-like &quot;When Death Calls&quot; which contains one of my favorite Sabbath lines: &quot;Don't laugh in the face of death, or your tongue will blister.&quot; It also contains such hard rock gems like &quot;Devil and Daughter&quot; and &quot;Nightwing&quot; that show that Sabbath had no intentions of retiring early. However, like I stated in my review for Heaven and Hell, the highlight of this album is the title track. It starts out with a killer drum beat and contains one of the most powerful choruses I've ever heard. Oh yeah, and the guitar solo is pretty damn good too. Unfortunetly, the Martin-era Sabbath could never duplicate the power of Headless Cross with follow-up albums such as Cross Purposes and Forbidden. But this release will always be one of my favorites Sabbath albums.
0446310786|5.0|This is one of the classic books of all time. It is written beautifully and the plot is great. This book is a must for anyone, whatever genre you read. The story is told in a masterful way and it makes you contemplate about human thoughts and ideas. Simply brilliant

B000002UAR|5.0|Listening to &quot;Revolver&quot; in its original UK version was a real epiphany for me.  I bought &quot;Revolver&quot; when it orginally came out in the U.S. in August, 1966.  Since I'm a big Beatles fan, I naturally enjoyed it.  However, the Capitol Records version (on LP) only had 11 songs on it.  I thought it strange that out of 11 songs only 2 were John Lennon songs (and both came at the end of each side).  Therefore, I felt &quot;Revolver&quot; was a great album, albeit an unbalanced collection leaning to far on the McCartney side.<br />When I finally heard the British version, with 14 songs, I discovered that the 3 songs missing from the Capitol version (&quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Robert&quot;) were all John Lennon tunes.  Of course, I realized that these 3 songs were on the greatest hits LP, &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot;, released in May, 1966.  <br />Back in the 1960s, Capitol Records butchered every Beatles album up to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.  All pre-&quot;Pepper&quot; British Beatles albums had 14 songs per album. Capitol Records would release their own American versions by hacking 14 songs down to 10 or 11.  Usually they would stick a song hacked off a previous Beatles album and graft it onto a new one or, as was done to &quot;Revolver&quot;, 14 songs were hacked down to 11 (with 3 tunes being put on a &quot;hits&quot; compilation). When Capitol finally got around to releasing the British versions on CD in the U.S. (in the late 1980s) it was quite a revelation to hear what American fans had been missing all these years.  Of all the Beatles albums mutilated by Capitol, &quot;Revolver&quot; stands out as getting the roughest cut.  It's shameful what Capitol did to &quot;Revolver&quot; because, in its British version, it is undoubtably the best album the Beatles ever recorded.  <br />When &quot;Revolver&quot; came out in 1966 critics weren't calling rock 'n' roll albums &quot;art&quot; yet.  It took&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; to do that roughly a year after &quot;Revolver&quot; was released.  However, &quot;Revolver&quot; deserves as much, if not more, accolade as its follow-up received.  Listening to both albums today, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sounds like a flawed masterpiece, while &quot;Revolver&quot; sounds like a flawless masterpiece (in its British incarnation).
B000002KMY|4.0|Black Sabbath had just released their 1980 album Heaven and Hell in the midst of a lot of critisism. Sabbath continued to shut their critics up the following year with Mob Rules. The album lineup consists of original members Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler with newly instated frontman Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinnie Appice(who replaced the unhealthy Bill Ward). Although Mob Rules is a classic Sabbath album and a strong follow-up to Heaven and Hell, it certainly doesn't compare to H&amp;H. For example, the first two tracks on Mob Rules, &quot;Turn up the Night&quot; and &quot;Vodoo&quot;, are straight up rockers that totally kick ass but they don&quot; compare to Heaven and Hell's &quot;Neon Knights&quot; and &quot;Children of the Sea.&quot; Other strong tracks on the album are the title track and &quot;Falling off the edge of the world&quot; which show that this album wasn't exactly a crappy follow up to Heaven and Hell. However, the highlight of this album is by far &quot;The Sign of the Southern Cross.&quot; This is an epic 7 minute journey through god knows where that can easily compare to any track on Heaven and Hell. Although this song may be better than any song off of Heaven and Hell, the overall album was not as strong. Not to say I didn't go out and buy Mob Rules just as fast as I got Heaven and Hell, but you know what I mean.
B0000019PA|4.0|Don't get me wrong-- I like this album a lot.  Some songs are really excellent, notably &quot;In The Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot;, &quot;Oh Comely&quot;, and the instrumental &quot;   &quot;.  But there's just too much stuff here, and a couple of the faster tracks, especially &quot;Ghost&quot;, are not that interesting.  _On Avery Island_ is a more cohesive and more powerful record, so go buy that instead.
B000002B82|3.0|No More Tears is worth buying on the strength of the first five songs alone.  &quot;Mr. Tinkertrain&quot;, &quot;I Don't Wanna Change The World&quot;, &quot;Mama, I'm Coming Home&quot;, &quot;Desire&quot;, and &quot;No More Tears&quot; are some of the best songs Ozzy Osbourne has ever recorded. To be honest, &quot;No More Tears&quot; is just as good as anything from the Randy Rhoads days.    The bad news is the momentum dies after the title track.  With the exception of the song &quot;Zombie Stomp&quot;, there really isn't anything worth listening to. Enjoy.
B00004Y62T|2.0|and it was called, &quot;Single White Female&quot;.<br />I had put off seeing this film for many months, and after seeing it finally, I wish I had put off seeing it for a lifetime. Everyone I had spoken to had glowing things to say about this film, and to be honest, I just don't get it. I thought it was a good film with stunning filmography and the warm, sunny Italian locales were a nice departure during this, a cold winter. I didn't read the book so, my next analysis might be slightly off base, but I thought the film was absolutely riveting until the second murder. If they had just left it at Dickie being killed, and either having Tom Ripley get away or get caught would have been better than what they came up with. The ending played out, as it were, seemed very forced and rushed by the director and writer. I could almost hear them thinking, &quot;Ok, he has killed Dickie....now what...&quot; The film had to end of course, but all of the great endings for this type of film have been used and the creative juices just ran out. Finally, and I surprised no one else has mentioned this, it seems inconceiveable that Tom Ripley being this calculating person that he is, would introduce himself to Meredith at the beginning of the film as Dickie Greenleaf. One has to come to the conclusion that without this chance meeting and utterly stupid move on Ripley's part, we would have no movie. <br />Maybe someday, I will realize that all the great films have been made and to stop sitting down to watch new films with the idea that I am about to watch &quot;the greatest film ever.&quot; Not a criticism, just a comment.....your email flames are welcome at hotels109@hotmail.com.
B000050IMG|1.0|Two thumbs up? Please tell me that this is a misprint on the box because this movie was truly awful. Anything that was remotely funny was in the previews and the second time around...well, let's just say it was a challenge to muster up a chuckle. I wasn't even offended by the sex jokes or lewd scenes because they were LAME jokes and LAME lewd scenes. What a waste.
B00004XONN|5.0|I believe that in the great scheme of rock 'n' roll radiohead is the second most creative band, only second to the The Beatles. In a time where rap-metal saturates the industry, Radiohead daringly puts out an album without promotion (other than the blips which you rarely see) that is completely against the musical grain of bubblegum-pop, annoying rap, and radio dominant rap-metal. And even better they still achieve #1 in the billboard charts with this amazing 4th album. Radiohead is artistic credibility at it's finest! The only thing better than radiohead's 4th album, will be the 5th one!
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of the best film's that I've seen in quite some time. The breathtaking sequences and graphic effects really put me in this time period.  I also like the special features such as the hour-long gladiator documentary, and deleted scenes with commentary from Ridley Scott.  I definitely recommend adding this one to your library, and if you haven't seen it, rent it.  You'll want to buy it then.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I bought this CD only because I was taken by the CMT video &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; that I happen to land on channel surfing,  I hate &quot;todays&quot; country.  If you like the &quot;Constant Sorrow&quot; sound you will LOVE this entire CD!!!!  This IS Country music, the way country music used to be, when it meant something. I have played this CD non-stop for three days.  You won't hear any of these tracks on the radio,...  If you REALLY want to hear country this CD is for you...
B00003CXE6|5.0|Many critics of the year 2000 have stated that there really weren't any good movies this year. They were wrong. Gladiator is an exceptional exception to the rule! Having watched several Russel Crowe films previously, I was unimpressed initially with the fact that people were raving mad about it and yet it stared Crowe. So I went along to watch it for myself.<br />The film begins with a battle scene more realistic than any other film before (that I've seen anyway). When you think about a battle, you think knights in shining armour with glory charging down the mountainside to slay all the enemy, almost without loss. This battle was grim reality. In the heart of a German forest, amidst the oncoming winter, the mud and the grime, rank upon rank rank (excuse the pun, if you get it) are standing bravely waiting for the barbarian attack. The battlescene is horrendously gruesome with many killed and wounded on both sides. How the directors managed such realism is beyond me and shows the potential for the cinema in future films.<br />The storyline continues, Crowe (the general in the aforementioned battle) being exiled by the cruel new emporer to become a circus gladiator. The rest of the movie follows his extremely melancholy life, in which wife and child are murdered, and he earns a reputation as one of the greatest gladiators in the arena. The film ends with Crowe fighting against the emporer in the arena. The emporer secretly wounds Crowe before the actual fight to give him an advantage. I won't say who won, or it would spoil the ending, but I will say that the Gladiator is<br />A MUST SEE!<br />Unless you can't stomach the gore, in which case I do not recommend it. For everyone else, though, this is definitely one of the best of all time, and you will miss out sorely if you never watch it...
B00000AD94|5.0|I can't understand how this album isn't loved by all.  Not only are the songs very nice, with many sections that all lend themselves to each other nicely, but the musicianship is very strong.  Also, they get funky at parts, which I find is rare with prog-rock groups.  Most prog-rock groups just sound plain white, like Rush and Yes.  They get very jazzy sound.  I would definitely put this album up there with The Flower Kings: Retropolis.  NOTE: Lyrics on &quot;The Water&quot; may get slightly offensive to  people with their underwear too tight.
0380796090|4.0|I bought this book yesterday morning and stayed up until 2:30 reading it. It was a great read! I loved the character development, I was rooting for Claire, I despised James and got nervous every time a scene involved Helen. My particular favorite part was Claire's description of being a waitress. That was so accurate and hilarious!<br />I grew a little impatient at the end and must admit that I skipped a lot of Claire's self talk and scanned the text for quote marks so I could get through it faster. But I have already bought this for someone else, I've recommended it to everyone at work and hope to read Lucy Sullivan next Sunday! Thank you Ms. Keyes!
B000002PC6|5.0|Okay. I'm a woman in my late 20's and I grew up with Olivia's music when I was a teenager. Then I abandoned 80's music and my taste become more sophisticated. But Olivia Newton-John shines in my memory like no other singer ever has. Because she is a true star and she is fabulous! and this album is fabulous also. The beat, the melodies, her voice, her style which just comes through the songs, the words... they all transform you to another world and time. It is as if she really is the muse from Xanadu... somehow surreal. I love her. I know I sound like a fanatic but I swear as time goes by I realize more and more how lovely and wonderful she was and still is. Listen to this album and to the Xanada album. You'll love them.
B000003S09|5.0|This was King Crimson's first release and an absolute stunner. King Crimson is not very known in my country, I listened a track by them 3-4 years ago in radio. I liked that so much when I saw this album firsttime in a music shop, I quickly grabbed that. The album is so beautiful i can't express in words. I have never heard a sound so soothing and artistic to hear (traffic is another group that provides that, specially the later albums).     Track 1: &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; ... This is a little coarse compared to other tracks, but it softens up at later stage.     Track 2: &quot;I Talk To The Wind&quot; ... wonderfully mellow. The voice and the instruments combined to give us the Best track of the album (decision is not so easy, as each track surpasses others in some respect).     Track 3: &quot;Epitaph&quot; ... confusion will be my Epitaph ... after listening this song you may think to make this the best Track of the CD. No confusion about this being a great album to buy.     Track 4: &quot;Moonchild&quot; ... progressive rock at its best. Nice experimentation with instruments in this track.     Track 5: &quot;In The Court Of Crimson King&quot; ... great end to a great album, this track is ends with a nice background vocal theme.     A MUST BUY - if you like progressive rock. But I think anybody will like it (except the hardcore dance, rap, hiphop fans). I am not getting &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Discipline&quot; in my country. So I can't say this is their best effort. This one album has made King Crimson one of my favourites. Certainly one of the best albums i have listened.     Tips:- For best results listen in a dark room with your eyes closed.
B00004XQP4|4.0|GREEN DAY HAVE COME OUT WITH A VERY GOOD ALBUM. IT HAS GREAT SONGS LIKE 'MINORITY','WARNING' AND CASTAWAY. THE SONGS ARE VERY GOOD BUT I STILL THINK THAT DOOKIE IS BETTER. IF YOU ARE A GREEN DAY FAN YOU WILL PROBABLY LIKE THIS ALBUM.
B000000OEI|5.0|As most fans of Hans Zimmer would say, the early and mid ninties were his best years, and Crimson Tide is what brought him to fame. Although I often have a hard time deciding between &quot;Backdraft&quot; and &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; as Zimmer's best ever compositions. I would have to say that Crimson Tide probably has the better overall score, but Backdraft definately ownes the best main theme. (For those of you who consider &quot;Fighting 17th&quot; being the main theme) Zimmer is the master in the use of snare drums, and they fully come to life in Tide to combine rich synthesized music and downright incredible action runs to make this...The ultimate soundtrack. After I first gave track 5 some good time for listening, I was shocked. The brass roar to life, screaming their awesome theme, while strings saw away at their up-and-down cues, and the amazing thing about it all, is you can't tell that the music is all electronic! If you were to buy Crimson Tide thinking it was performed by a real orchestra, you would be guessing wrong. Zimmer is obviously the king of synthesized and electronic music, in such a way that is hard to describe. Hans threw all the effort he could into Crimson Tide, and the result? One of the best scores you'll ever find, alongside &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; and the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; soundtracks. Crimson Tide is the true blockbuster, and everyone should have it in their hands. Most would say (including I) that five stars isn't enough. Awesome score! Way to go, Zimmer!
B0000039PW|5.0|This album is the reason why I love hip hop and respect it for the art of it and the way The Notorious B.I.G. put it on a song and delivered it to his listere's is very impresive cause not to many rapper now aday can do that and he went beyond that. I'm happy I own the cd and it's was the album that got me listening to more underground and real hip hop cause I wanted that real appeal of what hip hop is all about and Biggie Smallz is all about that.<br />Just wanna say that it's a very sad thing that Biggie Smalls is gone but he can't never be forgotton cause his music will always live on and just wanna say that I miss him and I wish the best for him in heaven and this album I always cherish cause he put it from the heart and that's what I respect
0393312836|4.0|This is one of the few books ive read which not only causes the reader to expand his or her's language and perception of how our speech works but also causes one to evaluate society as a whole. Anthony Burgess's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is an extremely well written book contaning strong imadges of violence, rape and the tendancies of a malicious youth mind. In the book, he undergoes a treatment in which his body is instructed to become sick. Once his ability to commit these acts has been stripped from him hes left in a world he can nolonger relate to, and a series of excellently written events transpire. This book is one i would reccomend reading twice solely for the many messages within the story that burgess inserts cleverly. Highly recommended
B00000IO4J|5.0|If you thought 'Scream' was fun, you'll love 'The Faculty.'  It's 'Scream,' but with aliens instead of psychos.  The characterization is terrific, the six main student characters are sure to please.  I wish, however, that Marco Beltrami could come up with some new music.  'The Faculty' uses music from 'Scream' and even 'Halloween!'  But, anyway.  This movie was great and I recommend it to anyone!

014100018X|4.0|Harris' novel possesses more than just a tempting title. Chocolat is the delightful story of a mysterious, traveling chocolatier's ability to affect a small, trapped-in-the-past Catholic town in France. The protagonist, Vianne, heals the townsfolk's troubles with her delectable confections (she knows exactly which chocolate will please and appease each patron), a talent which causes her to be viewed as a witch-like threat to some members of the community--especially the local priest. Others, including a pickpocketing abused wife, see Vianne as a welcome miracle who will allow the God-fearing village to understand that earthly pleasures are to be enjoyed, not shunned. Harris' characters are diverse and entertaining. Her story combines both fairy-tale charms and dark glimpses into ignorance and intolerance.<br />I read the book a year and a half before the film's release, and I have to say that there are enough differences between the two versions that they should almost be viewed as two separate stories. While the film is a delight, it is unfortunate that it didn't preserve Harris' character of the troubled priest. I highly recommend diving into Harris' pages, before or after watching Chocolat on the screen. My own copy has been passed around to several different readers, all of whom enjoyed the tasty tale.
B000002GYN|4.0|The self-titled debut album by The Eagles laid the groundwork for their country-rock sound.  Following in the tradition of Buffalo Springfield, Gram Parsons and The Flying Burrito Brothers, the one time backing band for Linda Ronstadt, they show that they could write great songs.  The songs like the seminal &quot;Take It Easy&quot; have a country flavor, but more of a rock edge than true country-rockers.  &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; is an AM radio classic and &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot; is a pretty ballad. &quot;Take The Devil&quot; has a hard sound while &quot;Nightingale&quot; and &quot;Earlybird&quot; have a bluegrass feel.  The standout track on the album is the majestic &quot;Train Leaves This Morning&quot;.  The album is prelude for the greatness that would soon follow.
6305897786|3.0|While I won't give away any of the storyline as reviewers sometimes do, I will comment that this movie makes Satanism look like a nude romp in the park. This may equate something with  Polanski's odd existence but call me old-fashioned, I like at least one good-guy per flick. I enjoyed the chase during this film but like many reviewers found it anti-climactic, to say the least. Johnny Depp plays it close to the vest adding a brand-new character to his repertoire. You can easily forget it's him. All the acting is top-notch. If you are watching this film for the first time - pay very close attention - especially when the camera turns to something written on paper. Many clues are written. Also follow the names of the characters closely. For fans of the film, the DVD (itself) is excellent. Includes an audio soundtrack of Polanski describing every iota of the film while walking you through it, as well as a separate musical score. Worth at least a rental.
B000002GVO|5.0|Hotel California was the first Eagles album to feature Joe Walsh.  By combining with Don Felder, they created a potent tandem and pushed the band to a harder sound.  Like many other residents in the state, the band are not native Californians.  Despite that fact, they have become synonymous with Southern California. On this album, they examine all the high and lows of the land of hopes and dreams.  The word classic is thrown around a little too often, but the album's title track is one of only a handful of songs that are worthy of the title.  From the opening guitar riff, to the cynical and vivid lyrics to the closing guitar coda, the song is a tour de force.  Don Henley sings with a snarl in his voice and Mr. Walsh and Mr. Felder trade guitar licks in a can you top this fashion.  The song is a masterpiece, became their third number single, won the 1977 Grammy for Record of the Year and one never tires of hearing it.  &quot;New Kid In Town&quot; was the album's other number single and Glenn Frey sings with a smooth charm.  The song perfectly captures that breezy Southern California sound the Eagles made famous.  &quot;Life In The Fast Lane&quot; is the infamous rocker that details the hedonistic lifestyle of the late 70's that the band wholeheartedly embraced.  &quot;Wasted Time&quot; is pretty ballad and the orchestral reprise of the song leads into a stinging rocker &quot;Victim Of Love&quot;.  Joe Walsh's Eagle lead vocal debut is the suprisingly sweet &quot;Pretty Maids All In A Row&quot;.  Randy Messiness' swan song with the band is the soaring &quot;Try &amp; Love Again&quot;.  The album's closer, &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, almost matches the title cut in power and brilliance.  It tells of the pilgrimage from the east coast out to California and that it has to offer.  Hotel California was the band's peak and one of the best albums of the 70's.
B00003CXFG|2.0|I was able to sleep soundly 15 minutes into the movie... Only felt the desire to freeze frame or slow mow, once, and that was not anything spectacular...Glad I only rented this, and that I can still take it back and find a descent movie before the rental store closes..
B000002GXJ|3.0|Live is just an average effort by the band.  The songs are all top-notch and there are some nice surprises like &quot;Doolin' Dalton&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and a version of Joe Walsh's solo hit &quot;Life's Been Good&quot;, but unfortunately the live versions are basically a paint-by-the-numbers versions of their superior studio efforts.  The band are notoriously anal and perfectionists about their music, so that leaves little room for improvisation.  They also did some studio touch up work on the songs to enhance their quality which takes away from the reasons why you want to hear a band live.  You want to hear them in their rawest, most personal form.  Live doesn't live up to expectations.
0553573403|4.0|If you require an easy read with a quick resolution, forget the Fire and Ice series.  The books are loaded with detail, characters and subplots.  This is good storytelling- if you take on reading the series with the intention of sinking your teeth into a well written, imaginative, substantive tale you won't be disappointed.
B000002GXX|5.0|One Of These Nights is the last album to feature original member Bernie Leadon.  As he was the truest country rocker in the band, it is also their last album to feature country rock songs.  The album opens with the title track, which signaled the direction they would be going in.  The spooky bass and ringing guitars helped make it their second number one single.  &quot;Too Many Hands&quot; is a searing rocker while &quot;Hollywood Waltz&quot; contains a beautiful Don Henley vocal and as the title suggests a country waltz sound.  &quot;Journey To The Sorcerer&quot; is a Bernie Leadon banjo instrumental that is just a hair too long, but still fascinating.  &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot; is the band's apex in the country-rock vein and is more country than rock.  Randy Meisner's best song with the band is the soaring &quot;Take It To The Limit&quot;.  &quot;Visions&quot; is a solid song while &quot;After The Thrill Is Gone&quot; is a quiet number about love's lost.  Mr. Leadon must have known his days with the band were numbered as he closes out the album with the lamenting &quot;I Wish You Peace&quot;.  One Of These Nights started the Eagles dominance on the charts from '75-'80 and became their first chart-topper.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is one of Hitchcock's best movies.  It is very original, and extremely well-acted by three of the best actors in history.<br />Jimmy Stewart plays a magazine photographer who's stuck in his apartment while his broken leg heals.  He spends his days peering out the rear window of his apartment into the open windows of the apartments across the courtyard.  He sees lots of life stories, parties, arguments, sex, just about everything that happens in real life.<br />One thing in particular catches his eye though.  He sees what he thinks may be a man (Raymond Burr) trying to clean up and hide evidence after murdering his own wife.  He doesn't witness the murder itself, so he spends the next few days, with the assistance of his Park Avenue girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and his hard-nosed nurse (Thelma Ritter), trying to find enough evidence to prove it.<br />This move is a must-see for all Hitchcock and mystery fans.  Clearly one of the best ever!
B000002GYW|5.0|Desperado is The Eagles' second album and is a concept affair.  As the cover suggests, the band sing about the life of outlaws &amp; banditos.  The title track is a classic ballad and maybe the best thing that Glenn Frey &amp; Don Henley have ever written.  With it's picturesque lyrics and pristine vocals, it is a major achievement.  &quot;Outlaw Man&quot; is as hard a rocker as they've ever recorded and &quot;Saturday Night&quot; is solid country rock.  &quot;Doolin' Dalton&quot; sets the theme of the album and appears again in an instrumental and in the perfect closer to the album, the reprise medley with &quot;Desperado&quot;.
052594527X|1.0|As an undergraduate, I wrote my senior (art history) thesis on Vermeer's masterpiece entitled \\"The Love Letter,\\" and became well versed on what little information exists on the Dutch master.  While I understand that \\"Girl With Pearl Earring\\" is a work of historical fiction, I feel that the many of the author's elaborations border on the ridiculous (I particularly have problems with the portrayal of Vermeer's wife, who is depicted as an evil, jealous shrew).  In general, I found this small story about a poor girl forced to serve as a maid in the home of Delft artist Johannes Vermeer boring and slow-paced.  Laborious descriptions of the girl's workday and contemptuous relationships with other servants and the painter's family are tedious.  Chevalier has failed to do her homework and has taken too many liberties with history, resulting in a story that is flawed and silly.  Girl With Pearl Earring was a great disappointment that definitely falls far short of the genius Vermeer's name implies.  With all the false attributions made over the years to Vermeer, I am sure that this book would be the one association that would make him roll in his grave
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is the climax in the history of the Smashing Pumpkins.  Billy created his masterpiece.  The diversity of the songs renders it the White Album of the 90s.  There are so many incredible songs that to name a few would do the album a great injustice.  This album proves that Billy can do whatever he sets his mind too, composing classics in numerous styles of music on the same cd.  This album also represents something else, which in retrospect is seen as the turning point for Smashing Pumpkins.  This is their finale, their royal farewell to and departure from their kingdom of alternative music.
B00003CXE6|5.0|This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. The detail is tremendous and the story line fantastic. It is a story of tradgedy and couragouesness(spelling). All ages will love this movie except for young children. This movie comes highly recommended. Enjoy watching it!
6302610702|5.0|The \\"Godfather Part 1\\" has been described by many in the film industry as one of the greatest movies ever produced.  It is the story of a powerful mafia family, and their struggles in New York. The basic story behind the \\"Godfather\\" is the evolution of one character Michael Corleone and his rise to power within his mafia family. Behind this story there are many other characters that add to the plot and drama of this movie. The Don Vito Corleone and his youngest son Michael are the two main characters who together provide a story of survival within a mafia family.   The movie opens with friends petitioning the Don Corleone for services that they need. These petitions take place in a darkened, secluded office offering secrecy to those who need favors.  The dimmed lights are a common element found throughout the story to help create the mood of power, and secrecy, that lies within the mafia family. We see that the Don frequently helped people who needed help with money, revenge, or anything that they needed. The Don had only one request, that one day he may ask for a service in return from them. This dark opening scene puts in motion a tale of violence and revenge, which leads to the rise of a new Don from an unlikely character.    The characters in \\"The Godfather\\" truly make the film believable and enjoyable. The Don Vito Corleone, as played by Marlon Brando was brilliant. He played the role of  a mafia Don, as I would imagine a mafia Don to be.  His character is protector, leader, and provider for his family.  His voice was very raspy; and he would only talk loud enough for a person to hear him. No one knew what his plans were until the Don told them what he wanted, adding to the theme of secrecy within the mafia family. His character is so powerful; all the characters refer to him for direction. Even though the movie does not look closely at the Don, he is always present throughout the movie. I found Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino to be a profound character throughout this movie.  Michael was the youngest son of Vito Corleone, who planned to stay out of the family business.  Against his father's ideals, he fought in the war and became a decorated war hero. As business becomes more involved for the family, Michael gradually takes small moves to become quite involved. He portrays the theme of revenge by killing those responsible for the shooting of his father.  This act leads to a cascade of mafia wars throughout the city, and sends Michael to Italy for protection.  In Italy Michael is able to learn his native language, as well as his heritage, which enables him to become Don on return to America. I liked watching how Michael rises from meek to powerful. This is visible in the way he talks to people in the same hushed private way that his father did.  The scenery in Italy is picturesque with the small villages and vast open hills lining the screen. It is quite a contrast to the darkness of New York and the violent Mob wars going on. In Italy Michael is free to be truly happy, and become a very interesting character for the following \\"Godfather\\" movies. In my review, \\"The Godfather\\" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I liked the story, and it's view on the American Mafia. The characters are excellent, and the  scenery  in Italy is amazing. Mr. Copola did an excellent job in the uses of shadow and light to portray different moods, and feelings. This movie in it's complexity is a must see, and multiple viewings add to a greater appreciation of the movie.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Yap... Mr. Oscar (statuette) is waiting for you... This is one great adventure/drama movie.  One of the best movie in the last Millineium. Superb story, great directing, and a great cinematography, a beautiful assemble of actors, very nice costume, make-up, editing, etc., etc., etc... I wouldn't be surprised if this movie, gets at least 4-5 awards...
B00003Q43A|3.0|Yes the usual &quot;aliens are coming&quot; stuff  but - the most amazing thing for me was the strange parallel <br />Lets's see  we have a young president with a can-do attitude He has a cute daughter...and a very workaholic wife....any of this sound familiar? Oh, and of course the President saves the world. <br />I thought the whole thing was a somewhat subliminal attempt by Hollywood to get us to relate dear old Bill Clinton to the heroism of the films presidential character...all a bit too much for me and I'm a Clinton supporter<br />As for the rest of the film, as usual these days, the effects distracted us from a pretty mundane plot and a stupid ending ( with the obligatory nuclear blasts etc.)<br />Just one question. If the aliens were so advanced that they could build huge intergalactic spaceships and conquer everything in their path, dont you think they would have had the alien equivalent of Dr Norton to detect computer viruses? I cant even get my computer to speak to the internet reliably but apparently interfacing a macintosh laptop to an alien spacecraft is a piece of cake.<br />Dont buy this DVD- rent the video
0399146253|2.0|It took me almost 25 days to finish this book. Once, I have to stop, because the first few chapters were just self-pity, self-angry, and a bitter taste of life... I just have to read another book just to get away from those chapters. When I decided to finish it... oh well, I have to, I've paid for it... I don't think I would buy her next novel, I might just borrow it from the library to save money. Very disappointed!
B00003CX8J|3.0|Not much here I am afraid, and I am a big Sci Fi fan. The acting was atrocious with the notable exception of Mr Stewart who I assume got lost on his way to act in a more challenging movie. Yes the effects were great but they always are - computers dont forget their lines or miss their cues. I read somewhere that they are making a sequel  - Why men?
0790733226|4.0|&quot;Contact&quot; is an intelligent handling of the &quot;first contact with extra-terrestrial life&quot; theme.  No one gets infected or possesed, no slimy creatures springing from someone's thoracic cavity... none of that here.  Simply a closer-to-science-fact than fiction adventure, set in the present-day.  While the ending was a &quot;let down&quot; to some friends of mine, I thought it was right on the mark and completely unexpected.
B000002NZO|4.0|If we ignore 'From Genesis to Revelation', the result of Jonathan King's wanderings down the corridors of Charterhouse School, then Trespass is Genesis's debut.  It was certainly their first with this line-up and their first for the now-defunct Charisma label.  And what a joy it is.<br />From the opening plea 'Looking for Someone ...', you realise that this is a very special group.  Although Phil Collins and Steve Hackett had yet to join the band, most of the ingredients that contributed to their classic albums were already there.  Tony Banks's keyboards and Gabriel's distinctive voice changed little from hereonin, right up to 'Lamb Lies Down'.<br />I first heard this album back in 1973, some years after its release, but listening to it again takes me back to my life then,  residing at an English boarding school much like the members of Genesis had themselves done.  A weird, isolated existence, stuck in the countryside with no female company, hearing only secondhand of the aftermath of student revolution in the cities of Europe and America.  Genesis's lyrics don't usually refer to the big news items of the time.  The naive student art that covered their early albums illustrate a wealthy, pastoral existence that classically-educated schoolboys would have been familar with.<br />There is not a single bum track here.  As mentioned repeatedly by other amazon reviewers, 'The Knife' is a stand-out favourite.  But this album stands the test of time much better than say, early Yes.  Genesis didn't make a single bad album, certainly not until I stopped buying LPs (soon after 'Wind and Wuthering').
B000056PWV|5.0|Hitchcock clearly was a master with his tools. I would dare to say it is unlikely that many directors could do the same with the boundaries the script set - an apartment and a number of windows to be looked at. <br />But who didn't feel along with the main actor and his boredom, staring at other peoples lives and the sudden thrill and danger he gets entangled in? <br />Hitchcock here once more goes deep into the human psyche, digs out one of our hidden lusts and entertains and yet scares us with it.

B00003CXCS|4.0|Sorry, I don't have the space for a 'theater screen' in my house, so I'm still a &quot;fullscreen&quot; fan. I found it very annoying to see that the DVD version doesn't seem to be available in fullscreen. That is I still can't enjoy one of my favorite movies in superb digital quality without sitting closer than wanted to my TV. That is not what I wanted. Doesn't take away from the beauty of the movie, so.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Amazing!!! Since I bought it I've played it at least 100 times. At home, In the Car, at work... I can't stop listening it. I have a question.. Did &quot;Please, please me&quot; reach the top fo the UK Charts in 1962?????? If the answer is Yes.. Why such song wasn't included in the #1 album? Of course it doesn't matter. The 27 masterpieces included are terrific!!!!!!! Can I Give this album a six stars rate????
B0000508U6|4.0|Well, it seems that brief, shining moment of the first wave of British shoegazer pop is paying huge dividends. Coldplay is definitely influenced by now-defunct bands like Ride, My Bloody Valentine, and Lush, but they make their own mark here on &quot;Parachutes.&quot; It is a perfect antidote to what passes for pop these days.  There is something powerful about simply played songs about lost love and fading hope that becomes moving when a band of romantics with a few distortion pedals put their heads together.  To its own modest degree Coldplay help reclaim territory ceded to genre music (Latin, teen pop, and pseudo-metal) by the bursts of guitar overdrive of 'Yellow,' the shimmer of Don't Stop,&quot; and just about every other track. An album to listen to alone over and over and over....

0345423496|1.0|Having grown up reading Arthur C. Clarke books, I was expecting to be challenged and intrigued anew by the genious behind 2001, Rendezvous with Rama and Songs of Distant Earth.  3001: The Final Odyssey is proof of the horrible decline in his faculties.  He seems more concerned with pontificating on the wisdom of his past positions (like the Millennium falling on 2001) than on developing any new ideas.  This book managed to ruin my appreciation for the earlier books in the series.  I cling to the hope that Clarke is actually too infirm to write and 3001 was ghost-authored by some well-meaning but untalented assistant.  As the saying goes, I am less enlightened for having read it.
6303407188|5.0|To begin with, I have one thing to say: Why is this film no longer available on VHS, let alone DVD? This film has been regarded by many as Tim Burton's best film. The majority of critics were full of praise, and the film went on to win 2 Academy Awards-one for makeup, and the other one for Martin Landau's grand and touching performance of horror great Bela Lugosi. Ed Wood, the posthumously famous, cross-dressing director of bizarre, laughable, poverty-row budgeted horror and exploitation movies, was given his due in Tim Burton's fractured fairy tale. Wood and his cronies and acquaintances were, for the most part, &quot;fringies&quot;, those individuals who are marginally involved in show business, or once-greats who had fallen on hard times. The most famous of these individuals was, of course, Bela Lugosi, who, at age seventy, was near-broke, addicted to morphine, and for the most part, out of work. One of the few people willing to give Lugosi a break was Ed Wood. Wood's critics like to paint Wood as an opportunist looking to exploit Lugosi, but the man was there for him. Now, back to the film. The performances are very enthusiastic-the actors and actresses seem to be having a ball with their material-a funny and sad script that is, for the most part, historically accurate. There are no &quot;composite characters&quot; here. With such a collection of &quot;characters&quot;, which includes 400 lb. Swedish wrestler/actor Tor Johnson, wasp-waisted TV horror hostess Vampira, bogus psychic Criswell, and outrageously effeminate &quot;Bunny&quot; Breckinridge, who needs to invent characters? The film is shot in a historically correct black-and-white, and the actors, headed by the artistically courageous Johnny Depp, bear an uncanny resemblance to their real-life counterparts (Landau as Lugosi, Lisa Marie as Vampira, George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele as Tor Johnson, Jeffrey Jones as Criswell, in particular) The art direction is dead-on accurate, recreating every last absurd, cheesy detail of Wood's notoriously cheap sets, and the crowning touch is Howard Shore's evocative and eclectic film score. The score incorporates horror-movie cliches, complete with theremin, as well as mambo, bongos, and a wonderful &quot;hootch&quot; dance performed by the late, great beturbaned Korla Pandit on the organ. The fact that this wonderful looking and sounding film was not nominated for its score, cinematography or art direction is another mystery. But the biggest mystery is why Disney treated this film like a poor relation, did little to publicize or ballyhoo it, and then removed it from the video market is the greatest mystery of all. If you haven't seen this film, see it-if you can find it! If you already own it, pray for its re-release, preferably on DVD!urd, cheesy detail of Wood's notoriously cheap sets, and the crowning touch is Howard Shore's evocative and eclectic film score. The score incorporates horror-movie cliches, complete with theremin, as well as mambo, bongos, and a wonderful &quot;hootch&quot; dance performed by the late, great beturbaned Korla Pandit on the organ. The fact that this wonderful looking and sounding film was not nominated for its score, cinematography or art direction is another mystery. But the biggest mystery is why Disney treated this film like a poor relation, did little to publicize or ballyhoo it, and then removed it from the video market is the greatest mystery of all. If you haven't seen this film, see it-if you can find it! If you already own it, pray for its re-release, preferably on DVD!
0446525537|5.0|Yes, I am a hopeless romantic.  Yes, I take great comfort in believing in the power of true love in the world, so if this makes me a sap, then I'm proud of it! I have now read all four of Mr. Sparks' books and have enjoyed them immensely. Will they be considered great literature? Probably not. But they are completely believable and engaging, and appropriate for all readers. They have a wonderful way of transporting you right into the story. You are hooked right from the get go. Yes, they're easy and quick to read, and somewhat predictable, but so what? I've found great life lessons in much less likely places!  I know that many will dismiss Mr. Sparks' books as fluff, but I think that any writing that moves so many people in such a positive way is indeed &quot;great literature.&quot; Buy this book, and enjoy! (And buy The Notebook and Message in a Bottle also if you haven't read them yet! I also recommend Richard Paul Evans.)  :&gt;
630027120X|5.0|Encouraging and gut-wrenching movie, causing the viewer to explore the meanings of peace and Christ. Pay particular attention to who wins at the end. As it explores redemption philosophy, the movie provides many meaningful metaphors for how to live life, and live it fully.  What causes salvation?  Here is a manual for how one can practice non-violent love.  One of the few Hollywood mass-market movies to portray Christians in a good light- of historical significance on that point alone.
6305126062|5.0|A love story indeed!  A young girl's love for her horse and an unlikely couple's love for romance.....Through tragedy a young girl and her mother get to do some deep soul searching...the scenery is wonderful and the simple way of life that the movie portrays is quite refreshing in our hurry up and wait world today.  A definate tear jerker! Two thumbs up!
B0000507PC|5.0|Although there are many differences between the story line of Irving's novel and the screenplay written by John Irving himself, the changes and rule bending in this adaptation are responsible for the most beautiful, pure hearted and touching story I have ever faced. A rich, although already very explored, terrain for heart-breaking and tear-rolling emotions is the set for this amazing fable. St.Cloud's is an orphanage located in Maine, where the main character of the story was brought up. With brilliant acting by Tobey Maguire and Michael Cane, this movie touched me in a way I never thought anyone could. I never thought of this story as a vehicle to commment on controversial topics, such as abortion and incest. I've always looked at it as a story of how far you have to go, what a battle you have to go through to finally be able to listen to your heart. In addition to the beautiful story line, the script, Lasse's direction, the original score(by Rachel Portman) and the photography of this movie help me classify it as a &quot;master piece&quot;, it changed my life in a way I'll never be able to explain.
B0000039QA|5.0|The death of Christopher Wallace, a.k.a. the Notorious B.I.G., on March 9, 1997 was a tragedy all the way around, but it also robbed hip-hop of hearing perhaps the only MC who had the potential to be the greatest ever. That distinction usually goes to the rapper Rakim, but that's how good Biggie Smalls, as he was more affectionately known, was. He seemed to challenge the crown every time he grabbed a mic. <br />Raised on the hard-luck streets of Brooklyn, Biggie paid his dues to become one of hip-hop's biggest figures (both literally and figuratively), and Ready To Die, his first album, was one of the music's best. <br />It's rare that a rapper can have commercial hits and still maintain his street credibility, but Biggie Smalls had both. Even when he was singing &quot;I love it when you call me Big Poppa&quot; over a slick-as-champagne Isley Brothers beat, as he did on &quot;Big Poppa,&quot; Biggie possessed commanding verbal presence. It was the same with all his hit records, like &quot;Juicy,&quot; &quot;One More Chance,&quot; and others -- his fluid rhymes and unwavering lyrical rhythm were simply mesmerizing. <br />From his first single, &quot;Party and Bullshit,&quot; an innocuous cut from the movie Who's The Man, Biggie knew how to make raw, street-ready jams. Ready To Die, appropriately featured its share of mixtape and mix-show classics. &quot;Unbelievable&quot; paired Biggie's frolicking style over the crisp, bouncy beats of DJ Premier. It was the ultimate pairing of a preeminent vocalist with the world's greatest hip-hop producer. Then there was Biggie's duet with Method Man on &quot;The What?&quot; which proved that Biggie could adapt to any rapping environment even the charismatic, stuffy-nasal tones of Method Man and still sound fly. <br />Biggie's best-selling album was the one released only two weeks after his death, eerily titled Life After Death, but it never matched Ready To Die's moments of honesty, hunger, and redemption. Every time this album gets played, it's a moment of sad remembrance but, like Biggie himself, also a reflection of glorious skills.
052594527X|4.0|Opening with illustrative scenes of seventeenth century Delft, Girl With A Pearl Earring solidifies history as Tracy Chevalier paints with words a recreation of the past in intriguing authenticity. Vague historical facts make up the frame of the structure, and Chevalier's imagination finishes the job with an end product of a seemingly completely genuine world. Details and descriptions become images and smells, of people and places and things, and sixteen-year-old Griet comes to life in such a startlingly realistic way that it is impossible to think of her as any less than a newfound friend. <br />As Griet is left with no other option but to leave her poverty-stricken family to serve as a maid in the home of painter Johannes Vermeer, the reader is pulled along on a journey of Chevalier's explorations into the maturation of a budding young woman's soul, as well as her fascinating interpretations of the times. Seen from the eyes of Griet herself, her narrow views resulting from her sheltered life in a lower class begin to open up and reveal a wider world as her quiet, naive spirit awakens to intuition and maturity. The intimacy between the girl and her master flourishes-even in a household dominated by Vermeer's temperamental wife and her formidable mother-and Griet soon begins to find herself becoming drawn further into Vermeer's rarefied world of beauty, color, and light. This magnetism comes to a climax as Griet is immortalized on canvas, despite the wife's shocked displeasure. Chevalier's attempt at capturing this life results in a portrait that mirrors the elegance and the poignant beauty of the painting itself. Her elegance of prose brings to being the mysterious girl of the contrasting sensuous smile and unbearably sad eyes behind Vermeer's \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\", a painting likened to da Vinci's \\"Mona Lisa\\".<br />Factors of history, suspense, romance, and mystery are skillfully bound together to form a fantasy from the depths of Chevalier's creative mind,making Girl With a Pearl Earring an effective hooker. Even readers with no interest in art or those with no prior knowledge of the historical facts within this book will find themselves enjoying it greatly.
6305810109|5.0|Apart from simply implying that the film is the story of Alvin Straight, the title, \\"The Straight Story\\" is also a colloquial reference to Lynch's crystal clear vision. That, appropriately is where all irony ends. The Straight Story is not a film of metaphors or symbols, although the journey of a stubborn man across 370 miles to see his ailing brother, his encounter with a wide variety of folk has been construed as some sort of fable. Lynch, always one to expose the rot the lies beneath the picket fences, has a filmography that would encourage such an interpretation. The story here, from all angles is that of a man and his mower, and ofcourse everything in his long life that has led to this momentous journey.<br />Richard Farnsworth was nominated for best actor in a leading role, and lost. Perhaps that was appropriate. There is a certain falsehood in the word \\"performance\\". He wears the sorrow and the joy of some 70 odd years on his face. Unlike many movies about or featuring elders, the film doesn't presume him to be some ubiquitous fountain of wisdom. He is honest, and whatever wisdom he has was hard earned. The worst thing about being old he tells a somewhat hyper cyclist he meets on the road is \\"remembering when you were young\\". Maybe a better accolade for Farnsworth is people's inability to describe how he is in the film. An expression, that seems to emulate from whatever soul human beings have, is worn on his face. It says, and affects, more then is feasible to describe.<br />There was I recall surprise at the kindness of this film. Not just to Straight, but to the strangers he meets on the journey. They are, surprisingly for Lynch, not only sane, but ones I would be glad to run into if I just happened to be travelling on lawnmower. Lynch's fans would recognize that, although seemingly the opposite of the likes of Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart, The Straight Story comes from the same place, the same wordless search for the truth, whether in ugliness, beauty orkindness. In one scene that will be remembered for a very long time: Straight sits with a stranger. They discuss drinking, and from there, the war. There is no music, just brief sounds of battle, but no visuals. Both men experience an unexpected outpour that can only come adventitiously. He remembers those young boys back in the field \\"I dream of their faces. Sometimes, it's not even my buddies, sometimes its German boys. We were shooting moon-face boys at the end of the war. Every year I live is a year more then they've had\\". Quietly, this scene dwarfs Spielberg's entire Saving Private Ryan, and Lynch.... I was going to say does it, but rather, he lets it happen with the melancholy in an old man's eyes.<br />Search if you must but you won't find another film quite like this one. The closest I can think of is Wim Wender's Paris, Texas, another seemingly unaffected film. The elements of The Straight Story are indeed superlative. Angelo Badalementi's score, particularly the twangy violin, soft acoustic guitar of Laurens Walking, is cleansing, mournful, understated. Freddie Francis's photography is breathtaking, but somehow, never overpowers the film. I would call it a masterpiece. But what Lynch and his collaborators have accomplished is a form of cinematic purity that transcends such pedestrian praise. It gains an added measure of poignancy when you consider that Farnsworth took his own life last year in the face of terminal cancer. In the film, a stranger offers to give him a ride to his brother's place. He smiles, thankful and says \\"I am gonna finish this one my own way\\". I could never tell exactly why, but his final gaze up at the stars is one of the great moments in cinema.
B000001Y79|1.0|No Doubt are the biggest sellouts I've ever seen. If you look on the first album, In the lower left have corner, it reads :Bought and sold out in the u.s.a. what does that tell you?
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I heard &quot;one armed scissor&quot; on MTV2 and was a bit turned off at first, thinking &quot;those guys are just crazy... makin noise&quot; and then as MTV likes to do I heard it 3 or 4 more times in the same day and it caught. I'd heard ATDI before from a friend who's band had opened for them but never gave them a chance, this album inspires me to listen to rock music again. it feels like a mix of Nirvana, and Hum. with a heavy manic energy holding the whole thing together. Although the lyrics are hard to understand at times they send a message that kicks pop music right in the jewels. although overly deep at times ATDI is exactly what the music industry needs to turn it in the right direction.
B00004XONN|5.0|The January 3 reviewer from Longeuil, Quebec should be aware that plagiarism is a crime. His &quot;review&quot; was simply a verbatim copy of the ALL MUSIC GUIDE's review of the same album. Ripping off other people's work and presenting it as your own is very uncool (not to mention illegal). :(
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is a pleasant surprise.  While many hard rock acts are reforming the original lineups and coming out with lame albums just to justify a tour, Iron Maiden is still making great new music.<br />Just like all their previous albums this album has many great riffs and the songs are written to satisfy people who don't need their songs in the standard format.  Many songs go on for more than 8 minutes and change direction and mood during the song.  For people wanting the standard sub 4 minute pop and pop-rock songs that are all over the radio, then this is not for you.<br />If you were a Maiden fan in the 80's then pick this up and be transported back in time to when you came home with you album (or cassette tape) of Powerslave, or Piece of Mind.  This album has just as many experiments in new sound as those classics and delivers on as many fronts.  As I said before, this is not just an album to justify reuniting with Bruce and going out on tour.  Once again Steve Harris had a hand in writing every song (and co-produced the CD).  Steve loves to write about stuff that we think is cool, and songs like 'Brave New World' and 'The Nomad' are as adventurous as anything he's written before.  The music on this disc is new and fresh and all Maiden fans should get it and enjoy.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|The characters are very believable and the action is non-stop.  The story line is incredibly well done...Dennis Quaid is hot, hot, hot as a NY Firefighter...  Ladies you'll swoon for the men in this and the action will definitely appeal to all the guys out there!  Don't miss this phenomenal movie!
B000002LLC|5.0|This album features Madonna performing with surprising range, emotion, and depth.  That the compositions/lyrics are by Stephen Sondheim and are the type that you can't get out of your head for days is reason enough to listen, but hearing Madonna provide arguably one of her most impressive collections seals the deal.  I had totally forgotten about this album until a chance re-viewing of the movie Dick Tracy recently on cable.  This was the only album of Madonna vocals that I didn't own but I immensely enjoyed the soundtrack of the movie.  Aside from being a commercial endeavor, the album gave Madonna her first critical approval from her detractors who felt she was just a pop creation. She hits every note perfectly - a very enjoyable listen.
B00004T9UF|4.0|There is obviously many moods this album gives. A sense of humor, anger, reasoning, and much more. The Marshall Mathers LP, Em's second album, is far more deep than the debut. This is more emotional but I think it's actually even better than the first. I saw Rolling Stone on all this stuff about Em and Everlast's fights. I actually admit I enjoy some of the featured artists better than him. Dido has an amazing voice on Stan. But on Kim, it's the one that his wife was slitting her wrists about. On it he makes up about a fight that they got in. I first heard Public Service Announcement on radio sonicnet, though I don't count skits as tracks because they aren't enough.
0380789019|5.0|The book Neverwhere, by Neil Gailman is a great book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes gory or science fiction books. I wouldn't recommend this book to any person who hates vulgar descriptions or people under intence pain. There are some pretty vivid parts of this book and they are not for everyone. <br />Neverwhere is about a man named Richard Mayhew, who lives in London, England. One day as he was going on a date with his fiance he stumbled across a girl, Door, that was hurt. He took Door to his apartment and helped her get well. After he had helped Door, he was strangely forgotton by everyone he knew, including his fiance. He could no longer live where he was so he talked to a beggar on the street about the girl he helped. The beggar than took him to another world which is called London Below. That is where the whole adventure is started.<br />The great part about this book is that something is always happening and you don't tale the time to understand it in the beginning you will never get it. Because this book is a slow read and very long I don't recommend it to someone who is impatient or on a real short deadline. <br />Another aspect of this book, and why it is so confusing at the beginning, is that it skips from character to character. At one minute you are reading about Richard and his adventures in London Below, the next minute you are reading about Door and her adventure somewhere totally different. Both of the adventures are happening simultaneously. This happens throughout the entire book and sometimes it skips between three or four characters. Although this is perplexing don't get distressed, you get the hang of keeping multiple stories of people in your head. All the characters meet and relate to the story so it isn't totally random. This shouldn't be a reason why you don't read the book because it keeps your mind from wandering and it really isn't that complicated.<br />I hope you like the book as much as I did. It is so highly acclaimed that you don't have to take my word for it. The author really captures the nature of the underground world snd it is hard to find a science fiction that relates to real life.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|This CD would have to be one of the best investments that i have made as far as music goes.  Lenny Kravitz, unfortunately is so under-rated, that he doesn't get the acalades in which he most deserves.  He has written most of his material, and is talented enough to play the majority of the instruments, aswell as provide the vocals.  The CD starts with the Rock classic 'Are you gonna go my way', and is followed by other brilliant tracks such as 'Rock and roll is dead', 'Always on the run', 'Fly Away', along with the 70's feel of 'It ain't over til its over'.  The CD also features the song which infact could be named as his anthem 'Let Love Rule'.  It has been said that it is hard to fit Lenny into any specific genre of music, however i disagree with this - his music belongs in the category of all time classics.
B004LWZWE2|4.0|Let's checK:<br /><br />a. Concert: amazing. The best AC/DC video ever. In this concert, you can actually see the guysplaying, contrary to the annoying habit of bliding afst editing of recent realeases like RIVER PLATER, where you can'' t even see what's ging on, so fast the takes change from second to second.<br /><br />b. Package: very nice metal box, everything cool.<br /><br />c. Extras: the cards are ok. The pick also. The little book about the concert is well written. The really weak spot are the interviews, a bunch of guys (including awful Susan Masino) saying how great, magic, stupendous, marvellous, geniuses, beatutiful, breathtaking, everybody in AC/DC is.<br /><br />d. And, of course, you will not get a single special new interview made for this product by AC/DC themselves. (maybe due to Sony/Warner rights).
B000002UAU|5.0|In 1967, renouncing the life of screaming girls and cute faces, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr to the uninformed) walked into the recording studios of Abbey Road and, within less than 200 days, came out with the album that redefined rock music. Just looking at the cover gives you an idea of the music that's coming after you. Many think that &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; is the best song written by the Beatles, though there is strong argument for &quot;Getting Better&quot;, &quot;With A Little Help From My Friends&quot; and &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot;. What a surprise! They are ALL on this album, complete with great 'filler' songs like &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; and &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot;. The only clunker is George Harrison's philosophical quandry &quot;Within You Without You&quot;, which consists of George yanking at a Sitar and speaking about why people were different under the effects of LSD. OK, maybe not, but that's what it SOUNDS like. That's what the 'skip' button is for, and you'll only need to use it once. Second only to &quot;Let it Be&quot; and &quot;The Beatles&quot; (aka The White Album) in my mind, Sgt. Pepper is the album from whic every modern rock song stemmed.<br />Those who claim to like music in general who do not own it need to be Fixing A Hole where their brain's fallen out.
6302969352|2.0|This movie is really good, but it's not the masterpiece people keep talking about. The sound is awful, some parts are boring, the idea is not original. Of coruse Japanese movie at the fifties didn't have the resources the American movie industry already had in those days. It's worthwhile watching.
B000002UAR|5.0|&quot;Whoa.&quot;<br />This will be the first word out of your mouth once you listen to Revolver from start to finish.<br />Starting off with George Harrison's first &quot;real good song&quot; Taxman, this album takes the traditional view of the Beatles as the &quot;boy band of the sixties&quot; and throws it out the window. Say what you like about Ringo's skill, Yellow Submarine is a timeless classic that children will be taught in school for years to come. Lennon and McCartney never once wane with hit after hit, from McCartney's Baroque-sounding Elanor Rigby (complete with string quartet) to Lennon's traditional pushing-the-envelope style in I'm Only Sleeping. The Album refuses to be let down in the later tracks, with the timeless McCartney love song Here, There, Everywhere and Harrison's Indian-sounding melody Love You To.<br />Overall, you cannot pick out a single track on the album and say &quot;This bites&quot;. Any fan of Rock music that does not own this album should be ashamed of him/herself. Go out and get it TODAY.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I loved this movie...got it on DVD, didn't see it in the theatre. The suspense in the movie kept me biting my nails the entire movie. I watch movies for one reason...to be entertain and this movie has done that. Highly recommend it for movie goers who like high suspense and war movies.
B000002UB6|5.0|I read people about people saying that Phil Spector 'mutilated' the work that the 'Fab Four' did in their final years, and how he was such an 'inferior producer' to George Martin. The latter I agree with, the former I do not.<br />On Anthology 2 there is a recording of &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. In this version, John Lennon sounds alone and without sufficiant support. In this amazing remixed version by Spector, an orchestra and chorus fill in the song, making it a timeless classic. Harrison's &quot;I Me Mine&quot; is a herald for 70s rock to come, with the organ and guitar blaring at each other in a perfect entropy. Paul McCartney writes arguably his best work on this album, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Two of Us&quot;. While &quot;Two&quot; seems to fall back on older Beatles lyrics with new and improved musical skill (and no screaming fans!), &quot;Let it Be&quot; is a wonderful prayer for peace, one that touches the hearts of all who hear it, and the ballad of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; even with the strings commercializing it, is a sad, remorseful McCartney singing a song about what the Beatles started out on: love. &quot;Get Back&quot;, the inspiration for this album, needs no explination. Any person who has tuned into an 'oldies' or even rock station has heard this song.<br />Reviewers that panned this album are wrong. May sound like a biased view, but decide for your self. Let It Be that you go and buy this album.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney did it again!.....All the songs on this album are of excellent quality. The album contains 13 songs including the popular: Oops!...I did it again, Lucky and Stronger! This CD is really worth buying, even if you are not a Britney fan. The songs are of a very wide variaty of styles such as lively, slow, sad and love. I know loads of people who were not Britney fans before they bought this album, but are now listening out for all the latest gossip about her!  If you enjoy this album, you must check out the first CD! (Baby one more time). I hope this review is helpful to you!
B000002UB3|5.0|The last Beatles album to be recorded (though the second-to-last to be released), Abbey Road proves to be just another gem in the crown of 20th century music that was The Beatles.<br />Tracks 9-16 of Abbey Road flow together, into one jubilant song. Being an aspiring musician (though not a very good one), I have listened to these tracks time and time again, and can tell you that the Beatles are, without a doubt, the undeniable masters of modern music. I'll get back to those in a minute.<br />The album itself kicks off with &quot;Come Together&quot;, which everyone knows once they hear it, followed by George Harrison's only #1 wonderful Single &quot;Something&quot;. John Lennon, influenced by Moonlight Sonata, wrote what many consider one of the best classical pieces in the 20th century: &quot;Because&quot;. Even Ringo throws a piece at the album, the cute and fuzzy &quot;Octopus' Garden&quot;.<br />It's those last seven tracks that everyone will remember. From the mournful &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;, a beutiful rags-to-riches ballad where McCartney howls his sad verses from the heart of the Black Country; though John Lennon's little singers like &quot;Sun King&quot;, which features the Beatles trying very hard to avoid saying anything coherant in several forign languages, to &quot;The End&quot;, McCartney's final message to those that stood by the Beatles through their eight years of triumph and tragedy.<br />Let us not forget the enegmatic final song &quot;Her Majesty&quot;, Paul McCartney's final shove at the Queen before the band leaves the spotlight. It's a great way to sum up the entire carreer of the Beatles: Rebellious, wonderful, and funloving.<br />To anyone who even THINKS that they have the slightest intrest in classical, rock, country, or blues: This is the album for you. Might sound cliche, but, hey, it's true.
6305263248|4.0|This is a great blend of both action and drama. Robert DeNiro and Jean Reno deliver great performances as freelance spies hired to retrieve a mysterious silver case. Director John Frankenheimer shoots some very realistic car chases and shootouts. In his Director's Commentary (DVD edition) Frankenheimer says the chases were filmed at speeds in excess of 100mph and he had British SAS soldiers do consulting for the ambushes and shoot-outs.<br />While it may sometimes bore those with very short attention spans, the acting and well written script keep the film moving even when there is no action. If you are looking for a drama with great action, you can't do much better than Ronin.
0811826848|5.0|From &quot;Love Me Do&quot; to &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, the Beatles were always viewed by everyon as a phenomenon. I was born five years after the death of John Lennon, fifteen years after the band broke up, and yet, somehow, I've become an avid fan. Looking at the so-called 'authorized biographies' and such, I thought that this would be some kind of touchy-feely novelistic biography.<br />Boy, was I wrong!<br />From the minute I opened it in the bookstore to a random page, I was thrilled. Gung-ho pictures, poignant comments from the four and their closest friends and co-workers(like George Martin). Reading John Lennon's autobiography was a particularly moving moment, seeing the disillusioned Beatle's take on his own hard life. The whole book is not to be read start to finish, in my opinion. Open it to a page and start. I guarentee that you won't put it down until they prise your fingers from the book.<br />Don't Pass this one By. Get Back online and BUY THIS BOOK!
B000002HMH|4.0|Good 90's hardrock nonetheless.  There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said so far.  But I'm gonna have to back up those who have actually given this album a chance and haven't condemned Metallica just because they claimed that they &quot;sold-out&quot;.  Honestly, its become such an overused term nowadays and if I hear it again I'm going to vomit!  In my opinion they did no such thing, especially not with Load.  And good music is still good music even if its not the tear-it-up knock-the-walls-down thrash that these guys have put out in the 80's.  Personally I think almost all their albums are great in one way or another. Admittedly, I'm not a big fan of Reload, but that's about the only exception.  The first half of Load is especially awesome.  &quot;Ain't my Bitch&quot; and &quot;King Nothing&quot; are superb hard rock anthems while &quot;Hero of the Day&quot; and &quot;Until it Sleeps&quot; are toned down, but still just as effective.  &quot;Bleeding Me&quot; is slow almost to the point of being serene, but with an unusual twist that resonates throughout most of this bands songs.  Unfortunately, after &quot;The Cure&quot; it does begin going downhill, for the most part.  Just give it a chance and try to appreciate it for what it is, not for what it could have been.  It may not be a masterpiece like &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;Ride&quot; but its definitely worth owning.  Recommended.
B000002UAR|4.0|Yes, like most everyone else reviewing this album, I am very fond of most of the songs on Revolver.  However, my primary question is what Revolver are we talking about?  The American release from 1966 never contained the songs I'm only Sleeping, And your Bird can Sing, Dr. Robert, others.  They are from the original American album &quot;Yesterday and Today.&quot;   So why are all these reviewers acting as though they are brilliantly part of the whole Revolver concept?   Two possibilities: 1) They were part of a British Revolver album (which I doubt), or 2) They are now part of the CD.   If it is because of the latter, than I say &quot;big deal.&quot;  Let's not review this CD and call it Revolver!<br />AS far as VH1 critics calling this the greatest album ever, I don't think I want to go there.  I don't want to criticize Revolver so much as to say there are at least 5 or 6 other Beatle albums as good or better.  Including, Abbey Road, Yesterday and Today, Rubber Soul, Meet the Beatles, The Beatles Second Album, Let it Be, and The White Album.  Of course I'm being a bit subjective myself, but how can you not be when you start splitting hairs amongst which Beatle album has the best songs.   I believe Revolver has received such high rating in the VH1 album poll, because over the years certain critics or circles have promoted its acid like breakout music in reference to a song or two on it.  And therefore, risk taking usually gets high marks by the critics, especially when associated with drugs, rebellion, new genres, etc.  Consequently, some others jump on the bandwagon just to be part of the &quot;cool crowd.&quot;   Nothing against the Beatles mind you, I just don't feel this album contains their finest music.  No way.
0767830555|5.0|For Me, one of the best movies of all time.  Watching Taxi Driver is a haunting experience for it's realistic portrayal of loneliness in the city.  Great acting by De Niro and the cast, music by Bernard Herrmann, script by Paul Schraeder and everything else.  As for the DVD extras, it has enough features that make most viewers happy though it could still improve.  A Worthy Buy.
B00000JZI9|5.0|Since I had always enjoyed this movie, when if showed up on cable, after getting a DVD player, it was on the top of my want list, and I was not disappointed.<br />First, remember to go into set-up on language.  The default seemed to be prologic.  What a difference in switching to 5.1 channel.  This was a true reporduction of an excellent soundtrack, as opposed to very disappointing DVDs of other films of this era.  This is one DVD that truly makes you feel like you're in a theater.<br />As to the movie, what a cast!  There will probably never be a Silverado II because it would cost too much to get all these, now super-stars, back together.  <br />This is one of many truly great Westerns, but one of the few that is likely to show it's worth on DVD.
0930073193|5.0|This book offers a very clear description of a subject that most people find dry and boring.  Instead of referring to countless graphs and charts, Hazlitt manages to explain his assertations using common sense and language that a non-economist can easily understand.  This is that same format of the monthly newsletter 'Ideas on Liberty', published by the Foundation for Economic Education, which aims to improve the understanding of economics among laypeople(The Foundation has long been a supporter of Hazlitt).  One interesting thing to note is that Hazlitt was not formally trained as an economist, and I believe that's one of the reasons that he is able to state all these concepts succintly with no confusion.  Even more amazing is that the same policies that he speaks against and that have failed are being tried again, with nothing more that a different name and some other minor changes.  For those who think economics has to be confusing, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Well, I have to admit, I love Britney Spears. I love all of her songs, everyone since &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time.&quot; This was a great CD all around. It was full of her latest and best songs. My favorite songs were Oops I Did It Again (of course), Lucky, and Stronger. I agree with a lot of people when they say that a lot of Britney's songs are very similar to each other, but they are all happy, fun, and lively songs. If you need something to cheer you up Britney's songs should do it. I don't care for some of Brit's slow songs, as much as the fun dancing ones, but the CD is well worth it.
B00003CXE6|4.0|-- if you're looking for a really long movie with lots of violence and a true hero at the center, rent &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; instead.  In fact, the title &quot;Gladiator&quot; reminds me of a line from the first scene of the earlier film, where Christopher Walken says, &quot;Hey, did you hear about the happy Roman?  He was . . .&quot;
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a stunning masterpiece that has to be seen.  Even if you are not a fan of Japanese Animation the films artistry and textures are incredible.  The story line is a very simple story of mans struggle with nature and industry and will leave you in awe after the movie is finished.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone this a definite must have for any movie fans collection.
1556587864|1.0|One of the many sex-can-kill-you thrillers of the 80s and 90s, this one is particularly lame and offensive.  The ending alone should invalidate anything worthy that precedes it.  Is she or isn't she?  When it becomes clear that even the screenwriter (Joe the Hutt) doesn't know, and doesn't care, and only wants to leave room for a sequel, the cynicism becomes palpable.  The whole thing is an unintentional joke (sort of like Stone claiming she didn't know where the camera was positioned in the interrogation scene).  Everything backfires -- even Stone's presumed sexuality is undermined by Tripplehorn's vastly superior looks and talent.<br />If you want to see a good sex-equals-death thriller, check out &quot;Sea of Love.&quot;  Ellen Barkin makes Sharon Stone look like amateur night.
B00004XMVH|4.0|A friend of mine recommended this movie, and I am glad that he did.  It was very entertaining, and the action scenes are gripping.  I particularly liked the scenes in which Matthew McConaughey's character faces very tough decisions, and learns about the challenge of command.  The only part of the movie that I didn't like was the ending.  It didn't tie in very well with the rest of the movie.<br />I recommend this movie to anyone who likes other submarine movies like The Hunt for Red October, or Crimson Tide.  If you liked either one of those, I think that you will enjoy this film as well.
6304504012|1.0|She can't sing.  She can't act.  She can't dance.  All she can do is market herself and talk about her &quot;art,&quot; something genuine artists almost never do.  I will throw her this one tiny crumb:  she should wear the brown contacts more often.
6304383827|4.0|The movie Emma, directed by Douglas McGrath, is a delightful romantic comedy based on the 1816 Jane Austen novel by the same name.  The movie contains an abundance of irony and comedy.  In addition, this story is filled with love triangles, hidden romances, false assumptions, love vs. hate, anger vs. forgiveness, truthfulness, friendship, humiliation and a happy ending.   This story is based around a single character, Emma Woodhouse.  Being the youngest daughter and left alone with her praising father, Emma grew up to be a fine and kind lady, with an inkling of matchmaking her friends and a vain perception of herself.  Emma decides to befriend a local woman, Harriet Smith.  Emma takes Harriet under her wing and turns her into a lady of society.  Emma's matchmaking talents soon persuade her to set Harriet up with the local reverend, Mr. Elton.  Harriet falls in love with Mr. Elton while Emma tries to make their affections mutual.  This all fails when Mr. Elton reveals his true affections for the lovely Miss Woodhouse instead.  When Emma denies her love for Mr. Elton, he leaves the countryside and marries a pompous and talkative city woman.  Emma tries her matchmaking skills again when trying to set up the son of her friends Mr. and Mrs. Weston with Harriet.  Mr. Frank Churchill, the son, is a friendly and vivacious man who befriends both Emma and Harriet.  Throughout Emma's matchmaking ordeal, her long time friend, Mr. Knightley, repeatedly tells Emma to stop her medalling in other people's business.  Despite Emma's thought perfection by all the characters, she is really put in her place at the picnic on Box Hill.  Emma mocks the annoying and boring Miss Bates in front of all the other characters.  Mr. Knightley then scolds her afterwards.  This is a turning point for Emma.  She now realizes that she may not be as kind and perfect as she once thought.  Another realization comes over Emma when she recognizes that her feelings for Mr. Knightley are more than just friendship; she is in love with him.  Her love is then tested when Harriet reveals to Emma that she is too in love with Mr. Knightley.  But Emma does not reveal her true feelings to Harriet.  Mr. Knightley leaves the countryside to visit his family in the city.  Emma feels lost because Mr. Knightley left before she could speak to him and Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton are ignoring her because of her actions at the picnic.  Finally, Mr. Knightley returns.  He confides in Emma that he felt she had affections for Frank Churchill.  But Frank actually had affection for the niece, Jane Fairfax, of Miss Bates; their engagement was a secret and a shock to society.  Mr. Knightley also confesses that this made him jealous because of his love for Emma.  Emma rejoices in this news, and the two become engaged.  Harriet herself becomes engaged to her past beau, Mr. Martin.  The story ends well with both women engaged and the whole of the town is happy.   I truly enjoyed this movie.  The authentic costumes and genuine way the actors spoke really made the movie realistic.  Gwyneth Paltrow truly made the character of Emma come to life.  Her facial expressions and innocent yet prying voice made her the flawless and perfect lady Emma sets to achieve.  The story line keeps the audience interested with its twists, secrets and revealing of affections.  The movie starts simple, with the center on its main character Emma, then expands to encompass the whole of all the characters, and ends with the resolution of all problems.  I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a quick fix of romance or who likes movies with old English comedy or who enjoys to watch a movie full of destruction and chaos come together in the end.
6300216365|5.0|It's not perfect in the way Annie Hall was perfect (we were meant to believe in Alvy and Annie; these characters are sweet but never anything more than walking one-liners, which is nevertheless OK, because that was the goal), but it's one of the funniest movies ever made.  The LP flying out of its sleeve, Allen blurting out, &quot;I want to have your child,&quot; Allen taking his first drink (and not even swallowing before he collapses in a heap), that grunt he emits to his blind date, Bogart telling him which candles to buy at the supermarket -- I could go on and on.  Classic lines!  &quot;You felt like a woman last night and I felt like a man, and that's what those kinds of people do.&quot;  &quot;That's a good terminal, I've thrown up there.&quot;  &quot;No, my parents never divorced.  Although I begged them to.&quot;<br />But still, it's Woody Allen, and his rather aberrant view of women and sexuality is almost always edited out of local broadcasts nowadays.  (Keaton saying that she probably couldn't bear being raped, &quot;unless of course I was enjoying it&quot;).  But then, don't forget that even &quot;Duck Soup&quot; had Groucho uttering one unfortunate racist one-liner.  Like I said, not perfect.  But hilarious.
B000002BSG|4.0|I just loved this album!  Virtual Insanity is my favorite song.  I don't think Jamiroquai is a Stevie Wonder ripe off band, like so many others think.  I think they have such a distinct and refreshing sound.  It's nice to hear unique talent in this sea of boy bands and teen pop queens.
6301174240|1.0|Is it a movie?  Is it a music video?  Is it a freakish pederast's homage to the children he loves?  Take my word for it (unless you're a kid and nothing I say will matter) -- find the &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; dance number and skip the rest.
1558801871|3.0|This is finally a Spike Lee movie, besides Malcolm X, that actually makes sense - somewhat.  If you are into movies that have great jazz, this is it.  However, I couldn't really stay with the story because Spike Lee spent more time on style and symbolism than actually substance, like many of his other movies.  At times it seemed like Denzel Washington's and Wesley Snipes' talents were being wasted in poorly developed scenes.  Nonetheless, the jazz in this movie is stimulating, and Bradford Marsalies is great.
0553106635|5.0|The fantasy background of Knights/Dragons/Kings/Queens/Castles/Swords, etc has been a story for the ages.  So many books have been written with these romantic ideas in mind, so many that this type of writing has become somewhat of a cliche to me.  I have read extensively in the fantasy and sci/fi genre, and it is very rare that you find a fantasy setting that doesn't include at least 3 of the above elements.<br />Because of this repetitiveness it is very tough for an book/series to break out of the mold and stand above the rest.<br />Very tough, but not impossible.  George RR. Martin has proven this in his last book in this magnificent series.<br />Every book that comes out in this series is a promise from Martin, a promise that everything you are thinking will happen in the book will not happen; and there is no way to predict what the final page will say in the book.  The characters in these books grow; characters that you are familiar with for the last 3 books (it was overwhelming in the first book to be introduced to so many characters, but it pays off in the next 2 books) change and mature in inexplicable ways that you never would have dreamed possible from reading the first book.<br />I would like to applaud martin on so many levels here, I don't even know where to start. .to try:<br />The multiple plots he has created do not in any way take away from each other, but add a certain flavor/spice to the book that I have not found in any other books that use this style of split writing.  I can't wait to read the other characters in the book, not once did I flip ahead to that characters next chapter, because by the time the chapter was over about 1 character and I had started another chapter with another character I was engrossed in the new characters trials and tribulations.<br />The characters have grown.  So often it is a big problem that characters in a series of however many books long do not grow.  From the start of this series the characters have started dynamically changing and growing, and it is a pleasure to see where they will finally end up.<br />I could go on and on, but I won't.  Read this book yourself, and you will be rewarded.  It is very possible that the characters you hate will die/ or live and become characters you like, and you won't be dissapointed at all as to where the book ends up.<br />Read this entire series again and again.dynamically changing and growing, and it is a pleasure to see where they will finally end up.<br />I could go on and on, but I won't.

0679746048|5.0|I just want to tell you all that this book, is one of the best books I have ever read. Susanna Kaysan is brillant!  I really like her writing style.  It really makes you think who the real insane people are.    I would highly recommend reading this book if you like to be informed of what life can really be like. And you could get into the mind of a &quot;crazy&quot; person. Reading this book would not be a waste of time, it would probably be one of the best books you would ever read.
B00004Y62T|3.0|This film had the opportunity to take a Hitchcockian thriller and add social and psychological texture beyond the master's usual depth.  It does a great job of dressing for the part:  solid acting, smashing location shooting, good period and class detail, lush art design and costumes.  Unfortunately, soggy pacing and editing do in the momentum.  The director does not use the camera or other techniques to make Matt Damon's Ripley character grow from recognizably nice and nave to full blown creepy enigmatic, like Hitchcock would have.  The Ripley character achieves what he wants too soon, so that too much time afterward is spent on what he does with what he has gained and will he get caught.  Plot points and characters introduced after that point lack urgency. My husband fell asleep for several minutes in the last hour and when he awoke, I did not have to say much to bring him up to speed.
B000001DTM|5.0|Certainly the best album of the 1990s and one of the greatest albums of all time. Interestingly, unlike The Joshua Tree, none of the 12 tracks on this album would be considered smash hits (I don't think any of the tracks did particularly well on the singles charts). But as a whole, the album is MUCH, MUCH bigger than its elements! It is darker, more complex, more sexual than the previous albums; at times hypnotic, and at times incredibly romantic. At the time of its release, the world of music was in midst of a revolution. Grunge and alternative rock were the order of the day. Achtung Baby was as far from that musical style as The Joshua Tree was from 80s Heavy Metal and Pop. However, like a true classic, the album has outlived the fads of its time and continues to sound fresher than ever. I am sure I will still be listening to it 10 years from today.
6303921248|5.0|I love Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and am very fussy about film treatments.  Any adaptation has the onus of making the problems at the heart of the story understandable to a contemporary audience.  This production does a spectacular job of negotiating the landmines of Regency society that threaten the course of the heart. It also elucidates the subplots in such a way as to throw the stakes of the primary story into relief.  The brief scene in which Elizabeth Bennett's friend Charlotte quietly reveals how she manages to live in an unromantic marriage is powerful.  But back to our heroes, Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy:  Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth's performances just pick up and sing.  They mesh stunningly.  All of the actors do, there's not one misstep.  The settings are lush, the camera work perfect.  The Regency costumes and hair are well done, something worthy of note since too many period productions overblow them.  Note to fans of the Bridget Jones books:  this is THAT version of Pride and Prejudice, THAT Colin Firth, THAT pond-plunge scene.
B0000524E5|2.0|The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress.  The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13.  How wild and crazy can you get.  Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster.  Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.
0451197968|4.0|I held off reading this book, foolishly thinking that I already knew the story because I had seen the movie years ago... boy was I wrong!<br />If you're avoiding this book because you saw the movie, buy it and read it.  It is completely different than the movie.  The only thing common between the two is the Running Man game and it is set in the future.  It is much more of a social commentary than an action movie, so don't wait...
B00000ICD9|5.0|Hopeless Romantics...There's hope for you!!  This is the epitomy of what love should be.  The story is one for the ages.  What is your interpretation of what Heaven and Hell are?  ...an eye-full of cinemetography.  Great Flick.
0440214041|3.0|A quick, enjoyable read that tells us almost nothing about anything in the book.  It is a plot (a discovery of a motive for the death of two supreme court justices) that Grisham struggled to find characters for.<br />Oh well... I wish I wrote enough books to have a few panned by the critics...
0525945636|3.0|Although I read this book in two days and it really kept my interest, I was kind of disappointed. The character development was just not there in this book, and the main characters were always doing stupid things.<br />Someone will have to explain to me why the main character would marry the woman he was not in love with after breaking up with the love of his life. Does anyone really do this? Things like that bothered me about this book.<br />If you can get past that, you will enjoy this kind of mindless read.<br />This is definetly not up to Ken Follett's usual standard, but then again neither was his last book. Hopefully he will pull out of this slump.
0440213525|3.0|This was the third Grisham I had read.  Up to that point I had read mostly science fiction and fantasy all my life, so I didn't have a lot of experience with the genre of popular suspense.  When I read it, I thought it was the best book I'd ever read, but in hindsight I have found many more since that are much better.<br />That sort of sums this one up.  If you read a lot of these types of books, it might seem mediocre, but if you're looking for something new, check it out.
B000050XEI|5.0|Quite honestly, as others have pointed out, Enya has not changed much from her first album. Her tones, rhythms, and singing style have remained practically the same. But must change really be necessary? She was, after all, quite nearly the founder of an entire genre that has grown and expanded enormously. So, no, Enya's newest album is not that much different from her previous ones. But I only see this as beneficial; too many artists who find their niches feel obligated to change and step out of a style that works for them. Enya is Enya-- must she really change?<br />Her music remains soothing and uplifting and completely dominating her field, with imitaters falling far behind. I gave A Day Without Rain five stars not because it is different, but because it shows that Enya's personal style endures and that she can remain true to herself and her own niche without balking before cynics. I thoroughly enjoy this cd, and though I have many of her others-- and yes they are quite similar-- they are each the result of a talented woman who doesn't need to change much to discover her own genre.
0440211727|5.0|I really liked this one.  Not because it was a particularily fine literary example, but because it is so much more honest than all his other books.  You really get the feeling that he has infused the main character with everything from his own life and the plot is much more complicated that his later works.<br />Also, it is fun to see a writer of such great talent as he works out the kinks in his style.  You can almost hear him re-writing it as you read it.
B000001DVD|4.0|Def Leppard had more commercial success with later albums, &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria,&quot; but in my humble opinion, &quot;High 'n Dry&quot; is their best work. No surprise, really. Often a band does its best work when they're still hungry, trying to make it big in rock and roll. Definitely true here.<br />I think the first six tracks are the best, but all of them are pretty good. &quot;Let it Rock&quot; and &quot;Bringin' on the Heartbreak&quot; are the album's signature songs, but the instrumental &quot;Switch 625&quot; and the title track &quot;High 'n Dry,&quot; are every bit as hot.<br />If you don't have this album or you just want to relive some 80's nostalgia, be sure to add this one to your collection. You won't be sorry!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I know 5 Stars and it looks like you can't go wrong with this greatest hit's album but think twice before you start \\"one clicking\\". Sure it's a good primer thats got great songs but you'll be singing I'm a loser if you buy this instead of the original albums. Great albums should be heard whole and intact. Albums like Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, The White Album, and Abbey Road.  Don't buy this album unless you already own those and all the others I didn't mention. Yes the Beatles wrote great songs and if you must buy a greatest hits album I guess this one will do but they also made great albums. Some of the greatest ever. With the current CD's in there original English formats with more songs then the American LP versions, I recommend you go with those. You won't be disappointed.       &lt;More reasons: Revolver (voted #1 on VH1 list of greatest rock albums ever); Hard Days Night; Beatles For Sale; Please Please Me; Let It Be; Help...&gt;
B0000020C4|5.0|Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals of all time and I love this CD but I don't really think its the definitive version. I wouldn't necessarily call it the dream cast either. I've also heard the London recording and prefer alot of the songs on it. But onto the cast:<br />Colm Wilkinson is of course,Jean Valjean, I can't imagine anybody else singing the part, he brings such heart and feeling into the role,fantastic. He sounds great on this recording BUT he sounds even better on the London recording,his voice is much stronger.<br />Ruthie Henshall sounds really good as Fantine but I prefer Patti LuPone. LuPone sounds a bit,er,waily sometimes but she seems to capture the role better, and when she sings Fantine's Death/Come to Me she really sounds as if she is on her death bed(I mean that as a compliment)<br />Micheal Ball is of course superb as Marius. I've never heard anyone else to compare him with, but I really can't imagine anyone else singing the part of Marius, hes just so perfect as him.<br />Philip Quast is PERFECT as Javert. On the London recording Roger Allam sounds so weak, before I got this CD I use to wish I could hear someone with a strong,good voice sing Javert's suicide cuz its such a great song, and then when I first heard Philip Quast sing it I was like, YES!Perfect! Hes brilliant, he truly is Javert to me, Javert is like one of my favorite characters and its wonderful that they picked such a great singer like Philip Quast(I heard somewhere that Quast has also played Thenardier, which is sort of strange....hes just such a perfect Javert!)<br />Lea Salonga-I'm not too sure who I like better, Salonga or Francis Ruffelle. On songs like On My Own I prefer Ruffelle, shes not as good a singer as Salonga but she has such a distinctive voice, such an, um, Eponine type voice. On A Little Fall of Rain I much prefer Salonga, its just so heartbreaking on the 10anniversary album. Salonga though sounds too American, her voice is a bit too perfect for Eponine on most of the songs.<br />Judy Kuhn- I like Rebecca Cain MUCH better and I love Cosette's solo I Saw Him Once...I love the Love Montage on the London recording and was sort of disappointed in the change. Anyway, Cain has a lovlier voice than Kuhn.<br />Thenardier-Alun Armstrong is MUCH better on this recording than on the London one, though I prefer the London version of Master of the House. But on songs like Dog Eat Dog he sounds alot better, not so shrill and nasaly. <br />Well, thats about it. One of the things I like alot about this CD was it added alot of stuff that the London one didn't have, such as Fantine's Arrest and Javert's Arrival. So, if you love the London recording or the Broadway recording(which I haven't heard yet)then you will definitly LOVE this one too, I just don't think its the definitive version cuz some of the London recording I liked alot better.
0060922583|5.0|This is one of the most provocative books I have read in years.  In the first few chapters Mr. Talbot describes the emerging holographic paradigm in science, drawing on David Bohm's work in quantum physics and Karl Pribam's work in neuroscience.  I found both descriptions to be fascinating, and especially enjoyed the historical context for the work of these two seminal thinkers.  As a person with a master's degree in neuroscience and chaos/complexity theory, I found a couple of his simplifications misleading, but would give him high marks for his overall comprehension of the conclusions of Pribam and his followers.<br />The remaining 2/3 of the book is a discussion of how the holographic paradigm may provide a rational basis for interpreting a wide variety of phenomenon located around the fringes of established science.  He looks at everything from strange historical &quot;miracles&quot; like stigmata and appearances of the Virgin Mary to modern psychic abilities and LSD experiences, from out-of-body and near-death-experiences to UFO abductions.  In addition, he compares language used in the modern scientific discussion of holography with the language used by ancient mystical traditions.<br />Mr. Talbot's writing style is unusually clear and lucid.  All of this makes for a highly engaging book.  It kept me up late every night for more than a week.  I am a person who has had an OBE/NDE (out-of-body, near-death-experience), and can tell you that his description of such events is an astoundingly accurate portrayal of what I experienced.<br />I am also a scientist, and know that most of my highly rational, empirical colleages would have trouble accepting a majority of Mr. Talbot's conclusions.  This work addresses something so completely out of the realm of everyday experience for most people, and probes a world that is normally invisible to the five senses.  Hence, objective, empirical science -- as defined by a conventional theorist or practicing technician -- simplycannot address these experiences.  They are outside the range of focus of the tool that Western minds currently rely on.  <br />The service that Mr. Talbot provides is a challenge to rethink the conventional definition of science so that it can take into account a much wider range of human experience.  What he argues for is the acceptance, as valid scientific data, of the experiences of individual humans, across cultures and throughout history, that are remarkably consistent with one another.  These experiences address aspects of reality that are invisible to the skeptical eye, but become obvious to the person who chooses to develop other forms of perception.<br />As a person who was unwittingly thrown into an OBE/NDE experience, I am naturally inclined to read a book like this one with an open mind, and felt immensely rewarded for doing so.  However, if I had reviewed the same book before having my own personal experience of some of the phenomena it describes, I would have reviewed it as a new-age excursion into a realm of fantasy.  I am completely sympathetic to some of the reviewers who see it that way, and respectfully disagree.<br />I believe there is an extraordinary synthesis happening among the realms of human experience, one that can validate each individual's story, however unusual, and also one that honors all the different ways of knowing.  I see Mr. Talbot's work as one of the more important bridges yet constructed between traditional science and spirituality, between rational discourse about repeatable, empirically verifiable phenomenon and the quirky, esoteric or mythological elements of personal experience that actually define most people's experience of reality.  This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for any passionate seeker of truth.
B00004BZ0V|5.0|I loved this CD.  I bought it for songs like Rock the Casbah, Should I Stay or Should I Go, Train in Vain, and London Calling; but I have enjoyed the other songs on this CD like This Is Radio Clash.  For anyone who likes the Clash, this is a must have CD.
B0000024Z7|5.0|I can say that Santana was one of my favourite bands up until recently when I lost respect for Carlos with Supernatural because that is an album he did for the teen-agers and it's an example of ... where the band loses focus. But CARAVANSERAI is an absolute sensation and &quot;Song of the Wind&quot; is probably one of the best guitar solos of all time....the album moves you and you will begin to transcend when listening to it...it is a MUST have for Santana fans...throw away Supernatural and buy this one alongwith all the earlier works up to Moonflower. Other recommended ones are the first three, Welcome, Borboletta, Lotus, with Buddy Miles (Live), and Festival.

B00004XONN|2.0|'Kid A' is a mess. To me this isn't really music; it's silly bleeps and squawks and unintelligible nonsense. I can hear that on any Stereolab record, thank you. This radical shift in their sound has alienated many fans, and rightly so. I know people will just gobble this up thinking it's life-altering music but if you want an album with proper songs look elsewhere. 'Kid A' limps out of the gate and hobbles home in a cloud of dust. The real big let down of 2000.
0399146253|3.0|The last 3 or 4 installments of this series have left me saying that I was not going to bother reading any more of them, but of course I do.  This time I did not regret reading her work - it did tie up some loose ends from Black Notice and it was entertaining.  It did not bother me that we were privy to some intimate conversations between KS and a therapist/friend, b/c it allowed me to get to know her better.  At least this time we were not getting minute details of every meal that was cooked. I would like to see her throw Marino a bone and get off his back. Bottem line - if you like PC and any of her other works, you won't regret reading this book.  It won't thrill you the way her earlier works did, but it won't bore you to tears.
B0000508U6|4.0|It had to happen. Coldplay catch a break and now they're threatening to be huge. Along with David Gray's 'White Ladder' their debut album is the success story of 2000 and yes, the Travis comparisons haven't stopped coming. Only, Coldplay have shown us just one facet of their musical talents, while we know Travis can rock (yet for reasons unknown to me they choose not to). <br />But back to Coldplay. The single 'Yellow' is superb. It's one of those songs that you hope to hear everytime you turn on your radio. Without this one song, I don't think I could give this album such a high rating. The band picked the right songs for singles (Yellow, Trouble, Shiver) as these are 'Parachutes' highlights. If you want to buy this album and need just one more endorsement then you have one from me. It's a tough act to sound sensitive and comforting without coming across as dreary and miserable, but Coldplay achieve it in fine style. <br />Four and a half stars.
B00003CXMG|5.0|All I have to say is don't listen to the review that says &quot;Awful&quot;. Obviously there is an dime store psuedo-intellectual idiot in every crowd. 2000 was a year of disappointments as far as movies were concerned but even in a good year this film would stand out. Everyone I saw this film with commented about how they became totally immersed in the film. I WAS in the seventies the whole time. Amazing film and great music.
B000050XEI|2.0|I have been an Enya fan for over six years, but I must say, I was sorely disappointed by her newest release.  Not only was I stunned when my CD player quickly ran through the album and began anew (the 11 song description is deceiving), but the songs are, shall we say... edited versions of her previous albums?  Seriously, every melody reminds me of either Watermark or the Memory of Trees. If you enjoy getting your money's worth, don't buy this album. Yes, the sounds are &quot;pretty,&quot; but they lack the normal breathtaking quality of Enya's work.
B000002UB3|2.0|Abbey Road does not contain a single track that is as good as I Feel Fine.  There, I said it.  For all its &quot;heaviosity&quot; from Lennon's belabored &quot;Come Together&quot; to McCartney's suite of snippets, Abbey Road reveals a group of artists (finally) without a healthy vision.  One might as well say without a viable vision, as they then decided to call it quits.  On Abbey Road, the boys left well behind the glad exuberance of the early works (Beatles for Sale) and the edgy romanticism of the midworks (Rubber Soul), to end up with songs that are spiritless and overwrought.  &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;She's So Heavy&quot; are loud complaints that sounded a lot better when I was much younger.  Oh Darling is derivative (and also loud).  &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is absolute slumming.  &quot;Something&quot; is dross--a dreary sentimental lyricism that makes my teeth hurt.  The second-side suite has some nicer moments, yet it maintains a thinness throughout.  Its strung-together passages of energy and harmony exist as testaments to individual longer works that might have been.  The lyrics too fail, coming up short of the humor and insight of earlier Beatle works.  Mean Mister Mustard?  Sorry.
B000051VWW|5.0|Anyone who has enjoyed Sade's previous records knows that she deserves much more praise than she's had. A skillful vocalist, her unmistakable tone and phrasing is a perfect getaway from our troubles and sorrows. Even when she is singing songs like the Immigrant or King Of Sorrow, the inner effect is blissful and sweet.  Having only 5 lp's and a best of album  in more than 17 years in the music business, she has set herself as a sinonym of coolness for all music lovers. Always defined as a part of the ongoing fad, she has been labeled as jazz, lounge, AOR, Pop and other styles. She is only herself and that makes her an unvaluable asset for music lovers. In Lover's Rock, Sade and her band have aimed to simplicity rather than fireworks and the sound that made her famous worldwide is still there, cool, breezy and tender, and yet sweeter and wiser. &quot;By your side&quot; is a much better single than any other song these days and reminds us that beyond the Britneys &amp; Christinas, there is a sweet unexplored musical reality that hasn't been drilled to our ears by labels and, moreso, asks us permission with each song for turning us on and being a lovable friend. 5 stars all the way.
6304078102|5.0|Mr. Holland's Opus is an excellent movie with an all-star cast.  Each actor/actress gets into the role so much that you would have no idea whatsoever that they were merely playing, you think that they are the person. The music is extraordinary and gorgeous, and the scenes are dramatic and/or sentimental.  I have been playing the piano for 7 years, so I first saw this movie when I was in the 4th grade.  I fell in love with it, especially with the music.  Even if you do not play a musical instrument, Mr. Holland's Opus is fantastic movie that everybody should have the privilege of seeing.  It is, without a doubt, my favorite movie.
B00004XONN|3.0|Seems as everyone needed to do a review of Radiohead's new album, so here's my contribution. Nevertheless, I've discovered some reviews here which are simply cribbed from music magazines and internet sources, which confirms that there is both an enormous interest in this album and a lack of appropriate words to describe the feelings it conveys. So, what has happened? First of all, I'd like to say that &quot;Kid A&quot; is exactly the kind of experimental, uncommercial, 'back-stabbing' record other major bands would use to end contractual obligations with a big bang or to hasten the departure from their records company. Unlike many other indie-rock bands which have gradually incorporated electronic loops/beats and digital manipulation into their basically guitar-driven music over the course of the '90s, Radiohead decided to crash fully into a brave new world of sound which had previously only been explored by such outstanding techno artists as Autechre, Aphex Twin, and u-ziq. The questions are: Did Radiohead go a bit too far with their ambitions? Isn't this something of a 'hidden solo album' by Thom Yorke with some electronic burblings in the background? Is rock music on its last legs?<br />&quot;Kid A&quot; is in no way an improvement or development of the sounds and lyrics found on their last few albums, it's a total break with all previous concerns, which deserves, at first glance, a lot of respect and admiration. The aforementioned artists may be valid comparisons in terms of sonic approach and digital manipulation, however, I think &quot;Kid A&quot; is actually an attempt to surmount the mere electronic element and to arrive at a different attitude towards modern electronics and their possibilities. Sure, there are passages on this disc which sound as if they weren't created by humans and weren't intended to be heard by them, offering clear connections to the Autechre/Aphex Twin school of progressive ambient/techno soundscapes. But when you take a closer look, you'll see that there are still a lot of traditional instruments like guitars, bass, and horns on this album, confirming that &quot;Kid A&quot; is primarily a triumph of the production: The best songs on this album use this inner-tension relationship between acoustic and digital textures (not to forget Thom's voice, of course, which is used as another 'instrument') to create sonic pictures of amazing complexity and intensity. This works particularly well on the entrancing title track, which shifts a couple of times during its length to arrive at beautiful 'waves of static' which shimmer through the mix like the first morning light through a greasy window. &quot;In limbo&quot; is another brilliant song, with its dark, descending guitar chords matched against Thom's soaring vocals and gentle atmospherics in the background; taken as a whole, it's quietly intoxicating and improves with each listen. &quot;Idioteque&quot; is the most overtly dance-oriented track; industrial distortion filled with Warp Label-informed beats and dramatic vocal delivery. &quot;Treefingers&quot; is pure ambient and provides a nice counterpoint in the listening program since it's placed between two more aggressive songs, &quot;How to..&quot; and &quot;Optimistic&quot;.<br />However, apart from the aforementioned songs, the rest of this album just doesn't click with me. I've already told you that, when Radiohead's arty approach and their ambitions are coupled with interesting sounds and appropriate vocals, the results are stellar. But when Thom gets pretentious and the band is incapable of finding any hooks or melodies, the final product suffers and makes for an off-putting experience. This is particularly true for the rock-tinged and more conventionally structured tracks like &quot;The national anthem&quot; and &quot;Optimistic&quot;, which sound weak without the great songwriting that made Radiohead's previous album so enjoyable. In my eyes, there's a 50/50 success/failure rate, which means that I cannot rate this album with more than three stars. Maybe we should take a different perspective: This is a great effort for a band which seemed to be the essence of '90s guitar rock; I'm really surprised at Radiohead's ability to adapt and to leave behind all their past glories. Radiohead should look to the future for inspiration and relevance: If they are able to adjust and canalize their newly found influences while relying on their songwriting strengths, well, then their next album will be great. Rome wasn't built in one day, either.<br />My edition of &quot;Kid A&quot; contains a somewhat bizarre 10-page booklet behind the black disc tray. It's subtitled &quot;Theater des Todes&quot;, which is German for &quot;Theater of Death&quot;. I thought it was a sort of lyrics sheet, but it isn't. It features oddly arranged sentences and verses, like &quot;We boiled the head&quot; or &quot;Salivates in the ashes&quot;. Someone told me that this strange booklet is intended as a campaign against Britain's Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Tony Blair. However, I'm not quite sure what it really means.at I cannot rate this album with more than three stars.

0679879269|1.0|Pullman is a skilled novelist, but from the beginning a reader should know that this book is blatantly atheistic.  In and of itself that is not wrong.  Pullman may write about whatever he chooses.  But I have a hard time that this was marketed as juvenile fantasy and nowhere on the cover did it mention they would kill God, who was never really God anyway but just one of the older angels. The &quot;tempter&quot; (his word) Mary guides the children Lyra and Will into intimacy when she tells them her own stories of sexual discovery.  Their intimacy changes the world since they are the new Adam and Eve. Mary then flatly announces that Christianity is a big mistake that went on too long.  Had the cover been honest about what the series was really about from the beginning, I would not have read it.
0060931736|5.0|Students who are forced to read this slender but pithy novel in high school or university classes often dismiss it was being 'about nothing', or just a dead bore.  Which is a shame, as this powerful novel from Muriel Spark is one that needs to be appreciated and taken seriously - and enjoyed - by all readers, whether those in high school or those who lecture on it to classrooms of bored university students.  Perhaps the lack of appreciation for this novel by students is the lack of interest with which teachers approach it.  Perhaps it hits too close to the bone for many teachers, who, like Miss Brodie, endeavour to shape and form their 'set' and who, perhaps unwittingly, manipulate their students in the worst ways.<br />Whatever the reason, this text is one that should be read and taught ethusiastically, for it packs into its 150-odd pages a deeply comic yet troubling bunch of themes: betrayal, fitting-in, the power of imagination, adultery, and most importantly, the transfiguration of the commonplace.  In a way the book is at the same time a paeon to and a curse of the imagination, demonstrating how it can enrich life (such as in the antics of Sandy and Jenny) yet also how it can damage others (such as Miss Brodie's false and manipulative ideas about love, sex, Teddy, Rose and so forth).<br />Muriel Spark writes about things she knows well, in this case teaching, Edinburgh, girls schools, sex and betrayal.  A book not only worth reading, but well worth teaching, and an excellent introduction to the works of Spark, whose other works are equally compelling and astute.
B00004SCX6|1.0|You can say that again. None of the tracks on this second US release work for me. Sorry, it's all pop trash, just like all the teen trash that dominates US radio all the damn time. And what's the big idea of having a teen like Britney covering a Rolling Stones song like &quot;I Can't Get On Satisfaction,&quot; huh? It's bad enough 'N Sync attempted &quot;That Thing You Do&quot; on their second televised concert. I'd rather hear Cline Dion singing Queen's &quot;Who Wants To Live Forever&quot; over this pop trash. Real music and people with BETTER voices like my Bocelli and Lauryn Hill can't have publicity at the moment. Or airplay. Don't worry, all you concerned parents. It'll be over soon. Your kids will have to SOMEDAY get over this whole thing and explore deeper into the wonderful world of music.
B00000J631|5.0|This is a really good CD for any advocate of punk rock. But it troubles me, I read all of the reviews below, and none of them mention how good the Anti-Flag song was! Other picks: Less Than Jake, Dance Hall Crashers, NOFX &amp; White Flag.
B000050XEI|3.0|The music is what you'd expect on an Enya release -- nothing earth-shattering, but remarkably pleasant and soothing.  My only complaint (as others have voiced) is the brevity of the CD itself.  Surely, Enya could have included the two songs that were on the European release of &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; that were inexplicably cut for the US release -- making this CD clock in at just around 35 minutes.  <br />After a 6-year absence, you'd think Enya could at least provide us with an hour of new music.
B00000JQFM|1.0|ok, I picked this up a few weeks ago, I'm not a big fan of what joe does exactly, but i definitely appreciate what he does. His musicianship on &quot;surfing with the alien&quot; is remarkable...... dated, yes, but still remarkable. I'm just not and never was a big fan of his style, including steve vai, eric johnson, yangwei (pronounced &quot;ingvey&quot; i believe)   malmsteen  and yes I know that joe is different, and I'm sure I've offended many and, or some or none, by putting those guys in the same sentence and ,or category, but to me,they are all speed blazing, thrashing, shred master, finger tapping, very fast scale playing,  wah wah peddle riding, archaic sons of you know what. Their music goes about as far as I can throw a piano. So you know what I mean. The music is also about as deep as a small puddle after a light sun shower in florida.  Oh yea, the album review: While listening to &quot;riding an alien&quot; all I could think was how I could really hear this music as the back drop for a video game like &quot;cool borders&quot; , or some skating game or something involving nascar on play station. I just feel bad for guitarists who actually try to play like these guys. Come on now.. The 80's have been over for a long time everybody, lets keep it that way.       .
630460291X|2.0|Well lets start with the movie before we get to the DVD format.  The movie itself is good.  The action and story move along nicely and the movie certainly entertains despite a somewhat lackluster performance by Costner as Robin Hood.  The supporting roles, especially by Freeman, are superb and make up for Coster's sub par performance.<br />Now for why I gave this DVD 2 stars.  Everything about this DVD is atrocious.  First it is recorded on both sides with no identifiable marks to tell which side is A or B (there is in really TINY print on the center part of the disk an A and a B on the other side but you have to put it to your nose to see them)and there is no 5:1 surround or DTS to take advantage of the terrific sound effects in the movie.  Then there really isn't any good add ons for the movie except a somewhat shoddy but interesting historical background on Robin Hood.<br />Overall I would recommend saving your money and buy the VHS edition or hope they release a special edition DVD that fixes these shoddy oversights that really take away from the DVD edition of the movie.
0452282152|3.0|The cover of the book, Girl with the Pearl Earring, was what initially caught my eye.  I am not one to judge a book by its cover, so I opened it and began to read.  The book flows very easily.  I enjoyed the concept the author went for;  she chose a famous painting by Johannes Vermeer (the cover portrait) and proceded to weave an intriguing and interesting fictional tale about the young woman painted in the portrait and what her life may have been like during that time period.  <br />Griet, the featured young woman, leaves home to be a servant for a famous painter after her ailing/aging father is no longer able to make his living with his tile making trade.  She is sent to live in the house of a famous painter and his family of formidable characters to act as a servant girl, nurse-maid, and muse.  Through a series of overly predictable events, Griet eventually goes back to her parent's home in a (what I believe to be and the book does not detail) disgraced state.  <br />Once the decision was made to return to her parent's home, her life and fate take yet another turn.  Chevalier almost makes her character, Griet, the poster girl for the limited options girls/women had during that era.  The book is an easy read, completely predictable, certainly not profound, but not a complete waste of reading time.
0553296981|5.0|The intimate diary Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, published several years after Anne Frank's death, is a candid recount of the personal experiences Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl, went through during the Holocaust. Confiding in Kitty, her diary, Anne Frank has detailed descriptions of her living situation and emotional state while living in hiding. Throughout the diary, Anne Frank explains the hardships she encounters because she is Jewish and how her life has changed because of the Nazis' genocide against Jews. As a result of her experience in hiding, Anne Frank is able to understand her relationships with those around her and evaluate herself. This book is of tremendous historical importance, as through the words of a young girl those lost during the Holocaust are remembered.
B00000AFDW|2.0|Before this album came out I was so excited thinking that my favorite band in the world was back in the studio, just the four of them, the sounds of yesteryear were ringing in my head, Peter's jazz-rock drumming, Ace's unmistakable power solo's, etc.  When the album came out I initially liked it, although it did sound somewhat disjointed, and I really did not like the two slow songs-We Are One and I Finally Found My Way-YUCK!  Then I heard about the deception-the fact that Ace and Peter had not played on all the tracks-indeed-I now believe Peter perhaps only played on Into the Void and maybe You Wanted the Best...And it's anyones guess what tracks Ace lent his guitar work to, but probably only about half of the songs, sadly.  Well, now everytime I try to listen to it, I'm so bothered by the fact that it is not just the 4 members-as they HYPED the crap out of it-to be that I really have a hard time listening to it.  I feel ripped off and betrayed by Kiss, and for me I seriously doubt I can ever listen to this album without wondering if that is Bruce on guitar or Bob, or Eric Singer on drums or someone else.  Besides the fact it is not even Kiss's best effort anyways, and one of the best songs is the Ace song-Into The Void, which almost didnt make the cut!!  Gene and Paul, in my opinion, could do for a bit of humbling.  People who know Gene are laughing hysterically at reading this, I'm sure.  Also the extra single available on a cd included with the video for Psycho Circus was another Ace song, and it was great, much better than alot of the songs that made it on to the album.  In my opinion, Gene and Paul's egos got in the way of the music, bottom line.  I think this album was a mistake for them to make in the way that they did.
0380789019|5.0|I read this book at the recommendation of a bookstore employee, and I am so glad I took her suggestion.  Incredibly imaginative with wonderfully detailed elements, Neil Gaiman creates a whole world from the names associated with the London Underground.  Having visited London in 1997 and ridden on the Underground many times, I recognized many of the place names Gaiman used to create his fantastic world of London Below.<br />Our reluctant hero, Richard Mayhew assists a young woman, Door, whom he find hurt on the street little knowing what is in store for him.  His contact with the world of London Below sets in motion a series of events which changes Richard's life forever.  First, the world of London Above (his world) suddenly refused to acknowledge his existence.  No one recognizes him, they forget his name as soon as he introduces himself, his apartment is rented out, his desk is cleared away.  Richard goes looking for Door for an explanation, and that is just the beginning of the adventure.<br />Three words only:  Read this book!

But this 1956 production definitely is not the great movie the critics say it this. Its just a boring Japanese production, totally uninspired, slow paced. Ok, the famous fighting under the rain is a very well-shot sequence, but to reach that far one must be really determinated !
0788811355|1.0|I found this film one of the most pretentious and arty films.  I didn't like the character Ralph Fiennes played.  I didn't care whether he would die or not and didn't care about his love affair.  I could barely see through this film although I am pretty much patient with art films.

6305892806|2.0|This outing promised to deliver a fresh, more plausible  Jane Austen.  Laden down with too many agendas and obvious anachronisms, this film lacks the crackerjack wit of the author, although it is straining very hard to do...well, something.  O'Connor is a promising find, but she is unevenly directed here.  Alessandro Nivola, however, is the quintessential Henry Crawford: tortured by his first venture into a love of the heart.  Nivola flawlessly depicts a man who has never had to practice restraint, or hear the word &quot;No&quot; in response to anything he has truly desired.  Nonetheless, this film misses its mark.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|Once you watch this movie you will find yourself hitting the rewind button and wanting to watch it all over again.  Two of the best acting performances in a movie belong to Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel. For those of you gentlemen out there with a special father/son relationship, this is the movie for you.
6300216039|5.0|This adaptation of William Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet is by far the best ever! This adaptation is the one true one that follows the play so closely that you can take whole scenes and follow along with a book. While watching this, I opened the book we had and could read word for word what the actor was going to say. Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting had such great chemistry that you didn't even realize that you were watching a play. It seemed more as if you were watching two of your friends in the same room. They brought their characters to life better than anyone else who ever portrayed these two did. The other thing that made this movie so enjoyable was the lighting. Normally, we are used to bad things happening in dark places whereas in this version of the movie, bad things happen in broad day light and in the middle of the market square in front of tons of witnesses. This gives the movie an interesting tone as a viewer is not used to it. Franco Zeffirelli does a beautiful job directing this, getting exactly the emotions he wants. In other versions of the play, the couple who portrays Romeo and Juliet are either too old or too young. These two, Olivia and Leonard, are just the age that a reader of Romeo and Juliet expect them to be. And they act just like it. They are star crossed lovers at the tender teen-age years. Everyone knows the plot of Romeo and Juliet, yet the way it is carried out in this adaptation is unlike any I've ever seen. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is interested in William Shakespear and any of the adaptations. It might be little harder to understand because the language is the one of old, but the way it is presented is so wonderful that you lose yourself in the acting that you don't need to pay that much attention to the words. You can listen with your heart.
B000001Y9I|5.0|I think I played it about 20 times in a row immediately after.  Everything - but EVERYTHING - works perfectly here, with a special nod to Ian Paice and Steve Morse (nobody can produce a tone quite so squeaky clean).  If you like just plain good rock and roll, with great lyrics, played well, and recorded well, by a band that's quite obviously having a great time, then BUY THIS CD.
044022425X|5.0|OUTLANDER has to be the first one the reader reads..I know someone who started with the second book and was totally confused, she then read OUTLANDER, and finally all four and like myself, she is going insane waiting for #5 THE FIERY CROSS to come out...abt. the same time the first of her contemporary novels comes out, which is one of two that take place in Arizona. All of her books, in my opinion, are better than Gone with the Wind or Thornbirds...She is one talanted young woman, that is for sure!!

The album sounds better than the old albums with Adrian Smith!

Not to mention the greatest finishing track in history, Fear of the dark!
B00000J6AG|5.0|Oh, I only wish I could give this CD 10 stars!  I personally feel that Moby is a genius.  So many of the songs on the Play CD seem to &quot;speak&quot; to me deeply and express my innermost feelings.  Each song is different from the one before it, and there isn't a single one I don't like, which is very rare for me!  &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot; is simply perfect - it's the kind of song where, if you've had a terrible day, you can flop down on the couch, turn off all the lights, and listen to it, and when it's over you feel as though your own heart has been cleansed and refreshed.  Fans of the show &quot;The X-Files&quot; might be interested to know that the last two tracks, &quot;The Sky is Broken&quot; and &quot;My Weakness,&quot; have both been used in X-Files episodes.  &quot;The Sky..&quot; was featured in the episode that Gillian Anderson wrote and directed, and &quot;My Weakness&quot; was used in the scene where Mulder was reunited with the spirit of his sister Samantha.  Both these tracks are fantastic!  &quot;The Sky...&quot; is incredibly soothing and relaxing.  As for &quot;My Weakness,&quot; there are simply no words.  I think it is the most incredible song I have ever heard - the emotions it is capable of stirring up are incredible.  Every time I hear it, I like it more and more.  You have to hear it to believe it.  In my mind, the whole CD is worth it just for &quot;My Weakness!&quot;  But if you're looking for an emotional, versatile CD that you'll be listening to for years to come, this one is for you!
B00003CXAY|5.0|This IS the movie I'm waiting for before I buy a DVD player.  I have the soundtrack on compact disk, but I really miss the visual images in slow motion and high speed, two jets changing places on a runway, drivers in rush hour with the sun in their eyes, and the strangely slow-mo portrait of the Las Vegas casino girls (when one of them blinks, it lasts an entire second).  The last couple of times I rented it was from different stores, and there was a warp in the tape in the same place both times, so I'm hoping this film isn't being forgotten because the master is damaged.  It really has to seen to be appreciated.
0553573403|5.0|I enjoyed A game of Thrones it was different and interesting from what I'm usally used to reading in a fantasy book like DragonLance and Forgotten Realms. I had to re-read certin pages over to make sure I understood what was happening. From what I got out of it the main Familes are the Lannister's and the Stark's while there are a total of about 7 familes all together the main focus was on the Lannister's an Stark's. What really cought my attention is the Lannister's marrying with in the familes brother to sister and so forth to keep the Royal blood pure and strong. That was different plus it has become the survival of the fittest and who benifets from whos death. Reminds me of Drizzt's fellow people the Dark elves who fight to see which Royal House moves up the Ranks or dies from the Forgotten Realms books. all in all a good book that I highly recommened.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Forget all the [garbage] you've heard about Moby, his newest CD &quot;Play&quot; is one of the best mixes of soul, techno, and rock that I've heard in a long time.  The way he uses all different genres of music is incredible.  I would have to say the two best songs on this CD are Natural Blues and Run On.  If you don't have this CD by now : Please RUN, don't WALK to the nearest music store to get it; IT'S AWESOME. Peace out.

B000002AH9|5.0|\\"Lady in Satin\\" was Holiday's personal favourite recording, and it is plain to see why.  It is a retrospective take on failed romance, the pain associated with it and regret.  Holiday's voice is decrepit and worn, and thus perfectly complements the album's cathartic lyrics.  It is as if Billie has reached the summit of love, realizing that she can only turn back now and face some of its more disturbing realities.  Ray Ellis' orchestrations are captivating and flawlessly document Billie's voice in her final stage of life, as few other composers could.  \\"Violets for my furs\\" and \\"You've changed\\" are my favourite songs for precisely this reason.  They capture a rare and timeless chemistry from one of the most renowned singers of the twentieth century.
0060916540|5.0|For me, Simpson's personal account of his survival on Siule Grande was an emotional cocktail which I simply could not put down.  I was warmed by the camaradery between Simon &amp; Joe; frightened by the prospect that lay before them; chilled by the decisions that the each had to take; and finally brought to tears in the climax of this wonderful story.<br />I bought this book for my mother in an attempt to explain to her why I climbed mountains.  How foolish...
0316779237|1.0|I put this book on my wish list after reading various David Sedaris reviews.  I am currently reading another book by him that I am enjoying, but this collection of stories was a bit disturbing for me.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Isn't it amazing that this band that broke up over twenty years ago can bring out a 'greatest hits' album today that hits number 1 all over the world? What does this say about today's wannabe stars? I'll admit that the charts are not always the greatest indicator of good music, but this recent trend shows the value of writing one's own music and breaking away from accepted norms. This album shines with its remastered sound, bringing out the right instruments in the right songs, although it does miss some of my favourite tracks, such as 'Strawberry Fields' and 'Here Comes the Sun'. A great album to play during the evening whilst consuming a few beers with friends.
B00000163G|5.0|I think that TUPAC SHAKUR &quot;was&quot; the greatest rapper in the game. He rapped about everything from ...well, everything. He is a great rolemodel for me and some of my friends. The lyrics are the best that i have ever heard, and I've heard a lot of rapcrap, but Tupac takes the cheese with his lyrics and wicked beats.I can honestly say that I can rap every song on this album, I don't know, I think it's the kronic. Anyways this album is a must have forall kinds of &quot;peoples&quot;.
B000002UB3|5.0|This was the only album we had to listen to on a three day road trip. We listened to it nonstop, never getting tired of it. If you are going to own only one Beatles album, make it this one.
B00004STPT|5.0|I went out and got this cd right after seeing the movie.  It is INTENSE.  I especially like the two songs, &quot;The Battle&quot; and &quot;Barbarian Horde&quot;.  It is also a great movie.  You really shouldnt buy the cd if you have't seen the movie.  it won't mean as much.  i dont know too many people who haven't seen it, but if you haven't then go and rent it.  Then buy the soundtrack.  its well worth your money...
B00004YA66|3.0|Synopsis: Communication is re-established between family members separated by 30 years and an untimely, heroic death. By the use of a HAM radio and coincidental flaring of major sun spots/flares a father and son are granted a reunion. The question is: &quot;If you have the chance to alter the past for your own betterment do you worry about reprecussions, if any, in the present/future?&quot;<br />As much as this story tries to make Dennis Quaid out to the leading man/hero type I'm afraid he's lost a little bit of his luster in my eyes. He's not collecting social security or anything, but he doesn't have the same spunk that we're used to him having in his last good movie....say &quot;Innerspace&quot;,&quot;D.O.A&quot; or &quot;The Big Easy&quot; at least a five years ago.<br />As predictable as this movie could have been there were enough mind traps and confusion between simultaneous parallel dimensions and time warps to throw off anybody in this twist-of-a- twister. If you've seen &quot;Dead Again!&quot; and a few episodes of Quantam Leap I think you'd get the jist of this movie pretty quick.<br />Myself, not being a huge fan of a twist-on-a- twisters I do appreciate the one quality this type of thriller possesses. Things can get so intermingled that just about anything is possible and there can be one of a hundred possible endings. <br />With that I leave it up to you to decide...suitable for any age probably 15 or above as it does get a bit complicated. The acting was decent although not stellar. <br />I give it a C (73/100)because it's been done before. I've seen worse. If you've seen &quot;Dead Again!&quot; and liked it you'll probably like this movie. Conversely, if you see/have seen this and liked it you would love &quot;Dead Again!&quot;. Better acting and even stranger twist. <br />DVD Special features: There are two commentaries(neither of which I listened to because it's a school night - one by the director and one by the screen writer and an actor). <br />There is a brief chronological progression of the animation at the start of the movie. This is kind of trivial because I didn't give it a second thought at the time. 4 progression last less than a minute with almost no explanation. <br />Lastly, there is some science behind the feasability of parellel dimension/time travel stuff. I'm sure it was fascinating, but like I said...it's a school night. Actor bios and filmographies are also included
B00004YM0D|4.0|This is a great cd.  I am not a big fan of some of the stuff on here, but the Titans Score at the end of the cd is amazing.  it is quite intense.  the movie is phenominal, the best sports movie made, except for caddy shack.  that movie is the best movie EVER made.  but the soundtrack is great for ya, if you are into the type of stuff on here.  i was disappointed that there wasnt more of the instrumental pieces included.
B000002J3W|5.0|This albumn was a little different and much more aggressive than their previous albumns.  It starts you off hard and breaks into some unforgetable melodies like &quot;Breakin' Down&quot; and ends with a hard edge.  While nowhere near as commercial as their previous work, Subhuman Race picks you up, keeps you going and fails to disappoint.
6305358613|5.0|Cate Blanchett's performance was magnificent. Her portrayal of Elizabeth made the movie into so much more than a history lesson. She carried this wonderful movie into the land of classics. The supporting cast were excellent. Elizabeth's musical score stirred the soul and embraced each scene with grace and emotion. Playing the devil's advocate, I will say that with about one more hour in length some of the finer points of the movie could have been more clearly defined.
B000002INR|5.0|This is the album that started it all and put Skid Row on the map!  With Sebastian's reverberating vocals, the pulsating leads and rhythms of Snake, Scotti and Rachael and Rob's back beat, you will stay on top through the entire album.<br />This is a must for any serious hard rock music fan.  If you haven't experienced the driving force behind Skid Row, you don't know what you are missing!
B00001NFCY|4.0|A lot of people have talked about how Creed virtually copies early '90s grunge bands; after buying the CD, I have to admit that this is true. But that's not really a bad thing, considering how bands like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden are no longer in the limelight. With elements obviously borrowed from Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots, Human Clay is &quot;grunge revival&quot;; though it may not be the most original rock album ever made, it does a good job at carrying on the grunge tradition.
B00000DGUM|5.0|Once again, Skid Row keeps on amazing me.  Complete with our favorite songs over the years, plus some new songs we've never heard before, this albumn is one you will find yourself listening to over and over again.  The controversy over the albumn just adds to the intrigue.  You won't be disappointed!
0375707972|1.0|This was an extremely disappointing book.  Not only were the characters flat and undeveloped, the plot was trite and contrived.  Had the author spent less time asking one rhetorical question after another, and more time giving life to his characters, perhaps it would have been a better read.  Instead he forces the readers to cover huge gaps in characterization because he is too busy trying to be philosphical.  Not only that, but the story line is predictable from the beginning.  It is obvious what Hannah is struggling with fromt the word go.  And then to find out that that is her horrible secret, the thing that is going to send her to her grave in silence?  Give me a break!  I might have been able to sympathize with her, might, but because she lacks any depth as a character I cannot.  Who is Hannah and what are her motives?  A question that the author was too busy asking to answer.   However, the worst part is the &quot;romance&quot; between the young boy and a woman over twice his age.  It sounds like the fantasy of an adult man, looking back on his youth, not the beautiful reality of a loving adult relationship.  It was extremely inappropriate.  Had the roles been reversed, readers everywhere would have been screaming about the inappropriate nature of an older man with a minor, and yet review after review called this relationship &quot;beautiful.&quot;  I think disturbing is the word we are all looking for. I find it insulting to my intelligence that Oprah Winfrey recommends a novel, tells everyone how wonderful, powerful, moving and all that garbage, it is, and yet it turns out to be a flat attempt at trying to evoke emotion through a poorly written, base story.  Just because a celebrity says a book (or anything else, for that matter) is good, doesn't make it good.  Don't bother picking this one up.  What a waste of time.
B00003CXFV|5.0|Hurray for Erin Brockovich!  A true riveting tale of single mother who single-handedly goes against  the power company after learning of  many deaths, illnesses and birth defects in the remote town of Hinkley.  Erin Brockovich is as bold and feisty as she is sexy and witty.  From the moment she cons her way in to working for the law firm you will love this character Julia Roberts has so brilliantly portrayed.  One of Julia's best works to date!
0553106635|5.0|Having just completed the third book in his series, I can safely say that Mr. Martin is by far the most captivating author I've read in a long time.  Unlike some other authors out there (you know who you are), Martin keeps his characters active and keeps the plot moving.  If you enjoy fantasy books that are predictable, this series is not for you!  I eagerly anticipate book number four!
B000002IQW|5.0|\\"Slave to the Grind\\" is one of Skid Row's most powerfully addictive albums to date.  The critically acclaimed band keeps right on pushing the envelope on their much-anticipated follow-up to their self-titled debut album.  This album will glide you through the multi-facets of this dynamic group.  Die-hard Skid Row fans will not be disappointed at the somewhat harder and a little less commercial sounds of \\"Slave to the Grind\\".
6300274195|1.0|I bought this video based on a couple of very enthusiastic customer reviews, and I was so disappointed! My two year old was frightened by the darkness and mean-spirited behavior of every character in this movie. From a toddler's perspective, and from my own, ridicule, circus cruelty, a house on fire (in the clown scene, elephants falling from great heights, and drunkeness are not funny, entertaining, or good teaching aids for children. I get the whole thing about kids being picked on for any diferences they might possess, good or bad, but this is really presented on a more mature level than children are ready for.  As I watched this movie, I was reminded of seeing it in the theater when I was about seven or eight, and being very upset by the experience. I wish I had remembered that before buying this from Amazon, as I cannot return it opened. Parents might consider renting and previewing this one before purchasing.
B000002H6C|5.0|If you like old style Metallica, then you should own this CD.  It is the last of their great albums and features a couple of their best songs.  Newcomer Jason Newstead blends his bass style in well to keep that overall hard rhythmic sound which used to keep Metallica well ahead of the pack.
6304675399|4.0|The plot is so simple that becomes complex.

0553274503|5.0|This is the best, most inspirational book I have ever read! It shows everyone's point of view.. It is very good, and I recomend it to everyone  even if you are ove 13 I'm still incouraging you to read this book, it shows aweosme stuff
B00000ING2|4.0|The Movie:<br />It's boffo, fab, the real deal and a steal at that.  Norville Barnes (Robbins) plays a rube sucker (?) new to business in the big city who finds a job in the basement mailroom of Hudsucker Industries, Inc just as Waring Hudsucker, founder &amp; CEO takes a swan-dive from the 44th floor (not counting the mezannine).  In need of a dupe-CEO to depress the stock so they can suck up the Hud's shares, Executive Sid Mussberger (Newman) and the board install the Rube as CEO.  But he's got a plan.  You know, for kids!  Amy Archer (Leigh) is the hard-nosed investigative reporter lookin' for a scoop.<br />The movie itself rolls along really well.  You have to stay on your toes to catch some of the best rapid-fire dialogue since The Big Sleep.  Leigh, whom I usually despise, is excellent.  All the stars really play the hell out of their roles.  The Coens' writing and direction is top-drawer.  All this and it's clean enough to watch with the kids! <br />The DVD:<br />There is really nothing but the movie here - no cast filmography, nocommentary, nada, except french dubbing if you want that.  This is an older-style 2-sided DVD with standard on one side and widescreen on the other, which I find annoying.  Despite other complaints I didn't see any profound problems with the transfer, but then again I'm just a film-lover, not a home theater freak.  If you love this movie it's a good addition.
B000002HRE|5.0|Whine Whine, &quot;Metallica has gone soft&quot;, Whine Whine, &quot;They sold out with this album&quot;, Whine Whine, &quot;The songs are slow&quot;, Whine Whine. Lay off!!! If you were true fans then you would love this album. Fuel, The Memory Remains, and Devil's Dance are awesome songs. And as for The Unforgiven 2, well, it's possibly the greatest Metallica song ever, ranking up there with No Leaf Clover. A band can have slower songs that are still good. Being fast does not make a song good. What makes a song great are the lyrics and music and how well it fits together. Those are the makings of a great song. Not speed. That can help, but being fast doesn't necessarily make a song good. I too love Metallica's fast songs. But they have some slow ones that are just as good. So lighten up, whipe the slate clean, throw away your stupid prejudices that you have against this album and the ones that followed, and go listen to it again. As for you newbies, this is a great ablum and worth the price you pay for it! Go buy it now!
0312954468|1.0|This book was pure soap opera in an exotic setting.It was completely predictable and over-blown.
0525945636|2.0|Otherwise I wonder if I would have finished it. To be fair, if you had never read any of his really great works, it would probably be a good book. I, along with others, keep hoping for another 'Pillars of Fire.' This isn't it. I'm also becoming increasingly intolerant of factual errors. This is supposed to be the age of the internet after all and it doesn't take more than a few minutes to check some of these things. Don't the editors read this material before they publish it?
6305807086|5.0|My favorite scene in Being John Malkovich is when JM himself goes into the portal...and the restaurant is filled with all different JM's.  I was wondering as he was going down the tube what he was going to find by going into his portal.  I will not ruin it for you.  Watch this movie, if only for this scene!
0441172717|5.0|Dune is one of the best, if not THE best book I have ever read.  Frank Herbert does a great job explaining the characteres and all their fealings through italics, which lets you have a insight that you wouldn't usually get in novels.  The book is packed with tense scenes that are good even if you re-read them several times.  The only problem I had with this book, is that it is not divided into chapters, which makes it EVEN harder to put down, so it's not really a problem I guess.  It definitely scores a 5.<br />Thanks, John Horsley
B000002G23|5.0|This box set is a MUST HAVE for any Police fan, especially those who don't own all of their material on CD.  It includes almost every single song they ever recorded, and some live tracks too! You can put this box set into your multi CD changer and hear one great Police song after the next.  You won't be disappointed!
0679745653|4.0|In every book their is a moral. Something the reader continues to think about long after the novel is read. This book deals with one specific issue we all face today. Trying to find one's self is the moral in Breakfast at Tiffany's. The main character, Holly Golightly, a bright, charming woman, was trying to do just that.<br />With the title in tact, Holly thought nothing bad could ever happen to her at Tiffany's. She would eat breakfast there, while staring at the fine jewlery. Shorty into the book she got to know her neighbor (the narrator). They instanly became friends. Holly would always be with different men and she loved having parties in her apartment. One day she got a telegram saying her brother had died overseas. She became depressed and her appearance started changing. Later on an article came out about her being involved with a drug smuggling case. She never talked about it with anyone. She was going to marry a man named Rusty although he married her good friend. With nothing going for her, she leaves for Brazil in search of a new life.<br />This book was very easy to understand. I loved how modern it was and the way it described Holly's appearance, feelings, moods, and actions. It was great how it dealt with something everyone faces sooner or later; fitting in and finding your place.<br />I didn't like how sometimes there was nothing going on in the book. I found it somewhat boring to just read the narrator and Holly's conversations, in which some had no point. Other than that, it was a great story!<br />I believe this book is great for adolescent and twenty year old women. They can really relate to a lot of issues discussed within it. Men could even enjoy Breakfast at Tiffany's because Holly deals with everyday issues. It should be read when someone is feeling down and know they are not alone with stresses they have in their life.<br />There is one quote that sticks out in my mind. This took place when Holly was describing her love for Tiffany's. &quot;...get into a taxi and go to Tiffany's...nothing very bad could happen to you there, not with those kind men in their nice suits, and that lovely smell of silver and alligator wallets.&quot; This just shows how empty Holly's life seems because a jewlery store can give her the most pleasure.<br />Go out and buy this book today!!
6304806426|2.0|If you find adultry as hopelessly romantic, then this is the movie for you.  The beautiful images and sweeping landscapes conjure up a tale of old, when women were often prisonners in an arranged marriage to an evil husband, and their lovers rescued them from fair castles.  However, the heroine is merely a girl who married before she knew what she wanted, and the hero merely a man who is stealing his best friend's wife.  These characters solve problems by running away from them, not by staying true to themselves.
B0000025DD|3.0|Gilmour's debut solo album shows a different side to this man than may have been expected by many Floyd fans of the late '70s. The melodies are fairly light and airy, and the lyrics are equally unimposing. If you are used to the darker, more cynical stylings of Mr. Waters, this album may not be quite your preference, and if it has one failing, it is that, even by 1978 standards, it's underproduced. Still, many of his finest instrumental compositions are here. Nothing with quite the drama of &quot;Metaphysical&quot; from his second solo release, but still good listening for any true David Gilmour fan.
0393317552|5.0|In the first few chapters, I learned more about human history than in all my years at school. Very well written, it summarizes why civilization evolved the way it did. It systematically dispels existing racist/Euro-centric evolutionary theories by focusing on the history of food production and its affect on the human species. Truly a fantastic and FUN read, I'm sending copies to all my friends and relatives.
0440213525|4.0|I have read two novels of John Grisham: The Client, and Pelican Brief, but I find that The Client is more complete and intensely interesting throughout the story.  One of the reasons I like this novel is the realism.  Mark Sway is an eleven-year old, who had to live in a trailer.  His mom is out working all day, and he was left with his little brother Ricky.  The prologue portrays Mark and Ricky¡¯s life well.  It shows what they do, what their lives look like, and how they act against the society.  I also found that his style of writing is interesting.  It makes the reader comfortable but you are able to catch all of important facts as you go.  <br />Pretty much every aspect of this novel entertained me, except for the characters.  John intended to give Mark as the main character, but Reggie, his lawyer is the one who carries out and solves most of the conflicts.  Another displeasure about this novel is that I had to read it twice for a complete understanding.  This story takes place in several locations at the same time so it is quite confusing in the middle.  <br />However I would like to recommend The Client to everyone, especially the ones who want to be a lawyer.  This novel shows how lawyers run, and what problems they face in the real world
B00004RFCM|1.0|I bought &quot;Sex and the City - The Complete First Season&quot; on DVD. After the intro, the disk stopped playing. The error message said the disk is encoded with Macrovision protection software, and could not be played on my DVD player, and to contact my DVD player manufacturer for further information.  I won't mention the name of my DVD manufacturer here, but suffice it to say that it is a well-known and reputable company, and the model is relatively new and not cheap. I have played many DVDs on it, for example from Blockbuster Video, without any problem. I also just bought &quot;The Sopranos - The Complete First Season&quot; on DVD from Amazon.com and it played without problem.  I called my manufacturer, and they told me that today there are several different DVD formats, and they are not all compatible with each other. Apparently &quot;Sex in the City&quot; is encoded using one of those versions that is not standard. HBO Studios is the company that produces/distributes &quot;Sex in the City&quot; on DVD. &quot;The Sopranos&quot; is published by another studio. Unfortunately there was nothing that would allow me to play &quot;Sex in the City&quot;  on my DVD player, and I had to return it. For the future it appears that until DVD becomes completely standardized, it's risky to buy one without confirming ahead of time that there is nothing unusual about the format used on that particular disk.
0399134204|5.0|The beauty of this novel is the way in the the lives of mother and daughter so intricately parallel eachother.  Though their mothers grew up in China, under much different circumstances, their lives seemed to become entrenched in the same unhappiness and misfortune.  However, it is only through their mother's experiences and wisdome that these daughters are able to change and improve thier lives in ways only imagined by their mothers.  I think it is an excellent example of the strength of the mother/daughter bond and the strength of women in general.
B000002UB3|5.0|What a great album (CD)Abbey Road is.  This was the final recording in the studio by John, Paul, George and since they knew that this was their &quot;swan song&quot;, they gave it high focus and it definitely shows.  All of the songs on this have stood the test of time, and a few of the songs &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; are some of the best songs ever written and recorded in Rock and Roll.  This album highlights the best of musicianship, just listen to George playing the guitar and John and Paul not only with their unforgettable voices but playing the guitar, and Ringo does an excellent job playing the drums.  You can definitely tell the Fab Four were very focused during the sessions.<br />Sir George Martin did a flawless job producing this and that was no easy effort.  Each of the four had their own musical visions on this and you can tell even though it is the Beatles, each of the members wanted to display their own individual style.  No matter, because it is an excellent listen, very complex, yet simple, and some of the songs have tongue in cheek humor such as &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;, there is a love song &quot;Something&quot;, and some spiritual songs &quot;Because&quot;, &quot;Sun King&quot;.  Many writers have given their own editorials on this recording, so I wont attempt to dive into the inspirations or motivations behind this last effort by the Beatles.  All I want to do is enjoy listening to this over and over again, and I am thankful that I do.<br />Highly recommended!
B00001MXXG|2.0|This is one of the greatest films of all time. Period. Hillarious, beautifully paced and performances to last for all time. So a movie this wonderful and magical deserves a comparable DVD tribute. But no, this film is owned by Paramount and therefore gets spit unto the public in typical lacklustre Paramount DVD fashion - overpriced and underthought.      I give it 2 stars. One is for the widescreen. I doubt many of the film's fans have seen this treasure in its original format - and Hughes a skilled (if underappreciated) director takes advantage of every inch of screen. The other star is for the nice and informative commentary (although I have the suspicion it was lifted off a previous laserdisc.) Paramount has a great distaste for DVD and for many years swore it would never take hold of the format. Obviously its overwhelming popularity has forced them to retract their idiotic position. But, it is not without bitterness - and this DVD (along with the rest of Paramount's pitiful DVD releases) proves it.       Hopefully Criterion or someone will get ahold of the rights someday and give this fine movie the treatment it, and its legions of fans deserve.
0553106635|5.0|I have met and spent time with the man, but this review is not influenced by that, considering this series won me over back in 1996 with A Game of Thrones.  A Storm of Swords continues Martin's brilliant work, resolving mysteries, sub-plots and lives (literally).  A Storm of Swords is as good as the other two in the series, which are all brilliant in my mind.  Not since Leiber's Fafhrd and the Mouser has there been better dialogue with adult themes.  This series is weaved with a perfect blend of intricacy, depth, character development, pace, dialogue, realism, fantasy and theme.  Whereas Tolkien opened the flood gates for &quot;evil takes over the world, good battles to defeat it&quot; with the LoTR, Martin has become a true innovator and catalyst for what will be a barrage of copycats to come.  <br />This is a book where every chapter is a rich meal, where 900 pages can seem like 20, and for as much complexity that is introduced, it is a perfectly developed and paced story.  It is a complicated story that is not complicated to read.  Because Martin writes strictly from the first person viewpoint, the reader is privy to inner thoughts of characters.  Martin does not have to write a story to have to come up with ways for a character to tell the reader about something...the character whispers it to themselves, alone in a dark cell - to themselves and to the reader, the only ones there.  This style, mixed with tremendously developed characters (all of which we can identify with in one way or another) creates a deeper bond between the reader, the characters, and the story - Martin's ability is unique.  <br />A Storm of Swords is another rare book (but ordinary for this series in its greatness) that causes you to throw the book down in despair, perhaps cry, or get goosebumps from events that may shock or excite you.  Because each chapter is written in the POV of a different character, and Martin skips around a lot, it is impossible to get bored with the story...to make abase analogy...it would be like eating a bowl of strawberry ice cream, then part way through it is taken away to be replaced by a bowl of chocolate ice cream, then to a bowl of cookies and cream, then the strawberry comes back for a couple of bites...not only do you not get the least bit bored or sick of the story, but when you see the next chapter with that character you remember, you want to continue to find out more of the story.  It is fresh in the way it works within Martin's tale.  The story progresses very well, rich in descriptions, dialogue, sub plot, themes and writing above all else.  I cannot recommend this series or this novel enough - it is truly the best work I have ever read, and EPIC!<br />You will see this series pick up pace more and more as it snowballs with popularity, and for good reason.  As more and more are introduced, more and more will recommend...and as more and more Jordanites get a taste of Martin, their thirsts will be quenched and they will know salvation.
6305416249|3.0|The baby-proofing information in this video was good, but relied almost exclusively on buying specific, often pricey, products for your home.  By the time the video is through, the viewer will have to spend hundreds of dollars to purchase all of the recommended gadgets.  The video was shot in a &quot;real&quot; house (closer to a mini-mansion, really) that most &quot;average&quot; viewers will have trouble relating to.  Less well-off parents who may not be able to afford all of the bells and whistles presented here are given no alternative methods for making their home a safer place without busting their budget.
B000002BBY|2.0|One of the most over rated albums ever - admittedly a few tunes ('Hey Now') are catchy but overall this album is BORING AS HELL, particuarly 'Don't Look Back In Anger' which makes Phil Collins sound practically dangerous. However, I give 2 stars because the 'Some Might Say' EP was fantastic - their last great musical moment before they turned into The Rutles from beyond hell.
B0000029LG|5.0|A collection of classics, stretching back to the early 1980s. At one time, Jackson was totally amazing with his incredible and exciting stage act and his unique vocal style. He still manages to eratically make some great records but clearly his best work was on the THRILLER (1982) album and then closley followed by BAD (1987). Whilst DANGEROUS (1991) was indeed a very good album it held no surprises as THRILLER and BAD did. Still with all his best work pulled together, this makes great listening and is essential to any record collection. Riotously funky, uplifting and on certain tracks, totally amazing!  Nothing to me can out do the all time classic, BILLIE JEAN which is possibly the greatest recording of his career. A Truly magnificent album that allows you to appreciate how he rightly earnt the title of the king of pop. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00004XOWM|4.0|this limp bizkit album is good,BUT old fans that liked &quot;three dollar bill&quot;will be dissapointed by it as it strays away from rock to rap though it still has a good beat to it!!  people that are just hearing limp bizkit will love it!!  so keep on rollin'
B000050FEN|5.0|There are plenty of goodies and extra's in this DVD edition ofSe7en.  I only have two words for anyone who has not seen this movie,&quot;See It&quot;.  You really cannot truly appreciate this movieunless you see in at least 3 times.  When I saw it at the movies whenit first came out, I really did not pick up on the intricate detailsof the story of Se7en.  Now after all these years I finally see thismovie for it really was, a masterpiece.  It was very odd that KevinSpacey was not highlighted in this movie.  You never see him in anytrailers, nor in any featurettes.  There are many extras you get tosee on the DVD from trailers to featurettes to deleted scenes.  Theone main thing that many people are grabbing this movie off the shelfis for the alternate endings.  Now I know you want to know what youare buying because this DVD is not cheap.  There are 2 alternateendings with this DVD that are included.  One of them is not shot onfilm but presented on animated storyboards which contains a completelydifferent ending.  The other is the original test ending that did notfly over so well with the audiences. The ending we have all seen onthe DVD and in Theather is the last few mins of that same scene butwith more emotion from Brad Pitt's character.  I am glad they decidedBrad Pitt's character needed to show more emotion.  The performance hegives at the end must have been very hard to do because think of it,Brad Pitt's character had to act out about 6 different emotions(despair, shock, rage, anger, hatred, sadness) all at the same time.It is truly the best scenes in the movie.  Buy this movie now.
B00003CX8J|2.0|This movie is very simplistic and predictable, yet too violet for a young child to view.  Some of the special effects are interesting, but not enough to make you forget how boring this movie is. I watched this movie with my husband and 2 sons, age 12 and 15.  None of us liked it.  I admit it is not my type of movie, but it could have been and SHOULD HAVE BEEN my sons type.  They enjoyed the X-Men cartoon when they were younger.
B00000JY1X|5.0|This is easily the best album i've bought in the past few years. Almost all of the songs are at the very least good, and there are quite a few that are phenomenal. My two favorites are papa was a rodeo, and yeah, oh yeah. if you are affraid to take the risk on the whole set, you can't go wrong with any of the individual discs. stephin merrit is a genius and it shows on this opus, i first heard songs off of it in an interview with him on Fresh Air on NPR. The thing he pointed out there that makes this album work on two levels for me is that none of the songs are truly orignal, they are all parodies and twists on older songs and genres. or if you don't want to take it with a grain of salt, as merrit intended it, the songs can easily be taken as genuine, emotional love songs. it works however you want.
B000050IMG|1.0|This movie was amazing in how unfunny it was...the original &quot;Scream&quot; had more funny moments, despite the fact that 'Scream&quot;, of course, wasn't meant to be a comedy. <br />First of all, &quot;Scary Movie&quot; plods through the plot of its main inspiration, &quot;Scream,&quot; way too much. I felt like I was watching an inferior version of that (highly overrrated) movie, and boy was I bored. <br />Secondly, the movie made a lot of dated references (think &quot;whassup&quot;? and &quot;I see dead people&quot;). These were funny the first time (in the trailers) but are already quite stale. This is the new trend of movies nowadays, to use very dated pop-culture references to draw cheap laughs out of audience. How lazy! I think they made the trailer for this movie first, and then threw together a movie afterward.<br />Thirdly, this movie totally ripped off &quot;Student Bodies,&quot; a much older (and pretty funny) horror movie spoof. <br />Fourthly, I was just plain offended by the gross-out humor, despite the fact that I have a very high tolerance for it (Pulp Fiction and &quot;There's something about Mary&quot; didn't bother me.) Much of the violence is directed toward women (the &quot;siicone implant&quot; scene being especially disturbing), and I found myself cringing instead of laughing.<br />There is so much funny material available for a horror movie spoof--somehow &quot;Scary Movie&quot; managed to avoid including any of it.<br />I'd like to add, for you parents out there, that this movie is extremely inappropriate for people under the age of 18, despite its obvious targeting of the teenage market.  I can't think of a worse movie to show to a teenager--and that includes porn!
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna is an artist who sets new trends and always comes up with surprises on a new album. Nearly three years after the enormous success of what is possibly still her best work to date, RAY OF LIGHT (1998) she returned to the studios with the same producer, William Orbitt for an album that unsurprisingly (and refreshingly) bubbles with a multitude of unique styles and ones that are thproughly excellent and stunning at that. MUSIC was the first single to be lifted from the album and it had &quot;hit&quot; written all over it and became a dance floor filler.  A totally stunning track! Again like on her RAY OF LIGHT album her voice is synchronized on a lot of the tracks and this perharps is used most effectivley on the infectious and instantly memroable track IMPRESSIVE INSTANT. Its an absolutley fantastic track that will undoubtedly be another dance floor filler if lifted as a single. RUNAWAY LOVER is another catchy, techno pop number whilst I DESERVE IT slows the tempo down which contains a country twinge to it and allows you more fully to appreciate her undoubted and unique vocal style. AMAZING rather sounds like a track left over from RAY OF LIGHT but is still a cracking tune at that and sounds like a sure firehit. NOBODYS PERFECT is a mid tempo electro-pop number, complete with synchronised vocals and noises. Bizarre but compelling! DONT TELL ME perfectly combines a striking mix of country and techno-pop and again WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL is a cracking track that has &quot;mega hit&quot; written all over it.  PARADISE (NOT FOR ME) is slower and more atmospheric and then the album winds down to two excellent cuts that again has a winning combination of country-techno-pop on GONE and AMERICAN PIE. A thoroughly magnificent album that is stunningly unique throughout! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
0684833395|5.0|This is truly one of the best pieces of liturature I have ever read.  It captivated me, I found it hard to put the book down, even to rest my eyes for a minute.  Heller does such a good job keeping your interest.  The characters in this book come alive to you.  You want desperately for Yosarian to make it through the war, and for something terrible to happen to Colonel Cathart.  This book does a great job shedding light on the insanity of war, and of the terribly beaurocratic systems involved with everyday life.  This book makes you laugh out loud, as well as making your stomach turn with apprehension.  Its amazing.
B00004Y62T|1.0|I regret those 2 houres that i spend from my life, I watch it at theatre 6 monthes ago, and I couldnt wrote anything about it because remembering it makes me feels sick, it it  disgusting, BORING, with no aim or clear line, you never know what this film wants to tell you, FULL of faults and unsequenced actions, unconvinsing at all, I hated myself that I spended those 120 minute in this poor, very poor work....
6300214826|4.0|I saw this film for the first time on video, and was somewat surprised by its somewhat deliberate pacing and lack of straightforward action. For someone who is not a huge Coppola fan, nor a reader of &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, I found the movie somewhat difficult to follow. <br />That is not to say that this isn't an excellent film. Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is an apparently unattached Airborne soldier who is &quot;waiting - waiting for a mission&quot; and is enlisted to find and &quot;terminate the command&quot; of the renegade Special Forces Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Along the way, we meet a motley crew of a Navy riverboat, including a very young Lawrence Fishburne as a 17-year-old machine-gunner. The plot takes an almost whimsical turn when we meet Lt. Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) who is an Air Cavalry commander, and plays the immortal &quot;Flight of the Valkyries&quot; while systematically laying waste to a North Vietnamese village. While the fighting is still going on, he orders a couple of his soldiers to either &quot;surf or fight&quot;, being that he is a huge fan of surfing. It is from Duvall's character that we get the immortal line, &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like --- it smells like victory!&quot;<br />After this scene, Sheen and his crew of Navymen proceed further upriver, until they reach the last American outpost on the river. The outpost is under apparent heavy attack, and there are no officers to be found. This scene, which makes no sense in the context of a typical war movie, makes perfect sense in this film. The leaderless American soldiers seem to move about in a haze, apparently oblivious to anything outside their immediate surroundings, particularly the grenadier, who is either at far beyond the point of psychological exhaustion, or heavily drugged. Copolla never makes either clear, but rather leaves that to the imagination of the viewer. <br />When Sheen and his crew get further upriver, the plot takes stranger and stranger turns - the crew is attacked by an unseen enemy, in which Clean (Fishburne) is killed, and shortly thereafter, the boat's chief is killed in an attack by natives hurling, of all things, spears at the Americans!<br />However, the strangest part of the movie is the last half-hour or so. Sheen reaches his objective, but Col. Kurtz is heavily guarded by native warriors toting modern weaponry. There are bodies everywhere - hanging from trees, floating in the river, laying sprawled about on the ground. It is truly horrific, and speaks to the level of insanity to which Col. Kurtz has descended, but it also begs the question - &quot;How could all those people stand being around all those rotting corpses?&quot; In the climax, Sheen sneaks past Kurtz' guards, and hacks the colonel to death. As he lay dying, Kurtz whispers, &quot;The horror - the horror...&quot;<br />All in all, an extremely powerful and moving film, although rather slow-paced.
B00004XRIV|5.0|This collection is 18 of their most representative songs, all newly remastered, and they all sound great!  Liz's often obscured voice is brought a little closer to the foreground, and Robin and Simon's playing and song-writing work are shown more clearely than I've ever heard them.  Proof again that we children of the 80's found a good thing, now made better!  If you are curious about the Twins' work, this is definitely a wonderful introduction into the mystery and haunting affection known to their fans as....the Cocteau Twins.
0767903854|5.0|Bill Bryson did an amazing job in writing this book. He made me want to go to Australia even more than I did previously. This book tells about all sides of Australia from the good to the bad and everything in between. Bill Bryson has traveled everywhere and wrote about the cities, oceans and the outback of Australia. I always knew that it was a country with vast amounts of desert, and that the Aborigines were the native people to the land, but I never knew how small a portion of Australia really is inhabited. I also didn't know how hostile an environment most of Australia- including both the sea and the desert really is, or how genuinely friendly so many of the people that live there are. Bryson also did a remarkable job of inserting facts in history into his novel, and how much. By reading In a Sunburned Country I learned numerous little known facts. It is to this day a mystery to everyone how the Aborigines originally got to Australia. There are deadly animals covering Australia. It seems that every couple of months someone gets eaten by a shark or stung by the most deadly of all animals, the box jellyfish. An insect that was thought to be extinct appeared in the Australian outback, only to be again and not seen again until fifty years later. Also incorporated into Bryson's book are funny anecdotes from his five trips to Australia. In Melbourne Bill Bryson saw a person who had recently held the second highest office in Australia selling books near a grocery store. This book is absolutely wonderful and no one should miss it.
B000002H33|5.0|I was in a weird phase for a while which seems to be fairly common once people discover progressive metal, melodic death metal or other \\"underground\\" forms of metal. I decided i would hate anything that was popular. That lasted a few months and i decided i would not like this album. I told people how bad it was and how much better prog metal and melodic death metal was. Eventually I snapped out of it and realized how misguided (and mostly elitist) that was. This is brilliant. Definitely one of the finest thrash albums ever released, so i guess what i'm trying to say is don't let your ego make you hate this like mine did! Anyone who even remotely likes metal should, and probably does own this. There's no need to think about it, this is too good to pass up, just order it. This was ahead of it's time. You can hear the sounds of Gothenburg, Sweden, trying (and for the most part succeeding, even passing at times) to imitate the glorious guitar harmonies Metallica once championed, along with the softer but equally melodic Iron Maiden. If you dig the melodic parts of this album, check out Sweden's melodic death metal scene. The vocals are very different, and it's more aggressive, but the guitar harmonies are amazing. You won't be disappointed with that part of it for sure.
B00004WGAI|5.0|This is by far the best version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; available. Superb Dalton, his best work, excellent Clarke, true to Bronte magic. BUT... please access imdb.com   TV series Jane  Eyre 1973 (mini), click &quot;for other customer comments&quot; read the 3 reviewers of the 1973 Jayston/Cusack version saying  it is excellent. IT IS NOT AVAILABLE.  Please email BBC.America.Shop@bbc.co.uk to request release of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; 1973 starring Michael Jayston &amp; Sorcha Cusack. I. and I suspect, other &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; devotees would like to see this version. Even though we love the Dalton/Clarke version, one can't have too much of a good thing.
6300214435|5.0|Steven Spielberg proves that he is capable of doing anything, the marveleous in this that he always do it SIMPLE...in this movie he was simple but makes you tentioned from the first second on the movie till it ends!! at the same time it is not complicated, you love seeing it, i dont know if you will believe this or not, but i watched this movie more than 5 times in the theatre!! its a very well done movie, nothing is missing at all, all is perfect, Harrison Ford is so good (as always)......it is really a the perfect action movie ever made.

6302794331|5.0|Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol has appeared many times in various incarnations, in the movies, on television and on radio.  I haven't seen or heard every version there is, but I would have a difficult time finding a version that is more enticing than this one.  In fact, I am not currently aware of any Christmas video that touches me more than this outing by the Muppets, not even my other two favorites &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas.&quot;  Yes, it is directed to an extent toward children, but it is also directed toward the child in each of us, and in this it succeeds 100 percent.  In fact, being an adult is definitely a plus in catching some of the humor.<br />Some of the better-known Muppet characters play important roles in this adaptation, including Kermit as Bob Cratchit and of course Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchit.  These two are by turns comic and surprisingly moving as the situation requires.  Gonzo in the role of Charles Dickens narrates and provides comic relief, along with his cleverly-named sidekick Rizzo the Rat, but the two wisely disappear from the film during the more somber Ghost of Christmas Future episode, to return, as they tell us ahead of time, for the finale.  And Fozzie the Bear appears as Scrooge's old employer named, not surprisingly, Fozziewig rather than Fezziwig.<br />There are certain plot changes to the story, but none of them are severe and none affect the tale's basic meaning.  One of the changes is that Scrooge presides over an office of bookkeepers of whom Cratchit is the spokesperson.  Perhaps the biggest change is that there are two Marley brothers, Jacob and the newly created Robert, played by those two hecklers whose names I don't know.  This modification gives the two of them a chance to sing a darkly comic duet about their current situation.  We do get to see the brothers one more time, as guests at Fozziewig's Christmas party, so our final impression of them is not as the suffering spirits.  Another important change is that the final scene takes place at Bob Cratchit's house on Christmas day rather than at Scrooge's office the day after, thus allowing for a big finale involving most of the major characters.<br />The Muppets and even the subtle changes in plot all add a little extra something to the show.  However, it is Michael Caine as Scrooge who really brings this picture off.  He is younger than most Scrooges, which gives hope that he will be able to benefit his community for many more years than he might if he were older.  His portrayal of Scrooge is so full of subtlety that I find myself sympathizing with the character at a much earlier point than I do in most versions.  For example, when he joins his former sweetheart in her good-bye song &quot;Love Is Gone,&quot; I am genuinely touched, because I can see that he has repeated to himself many times over the years the words she said to him that day.  And when he discovers that this Christmas he is the butt of his nephew's rather unchristian Christmas game/joke, I feel Scrooge's pain.  So we are well prepared for his completely believable and indeed inevitable final transformation when he sees his tombstone.  Caine is so good in fact, that I don't even begrudge him his appropriation of Tiny Tim's immortal final line.  He surely deserves that much of a plum, especially after spending the film acting with a bunch of Muppets, which cannot have been the easiest assignment of his career.  A wonderful portrayal from every aspect.<br />I mentioned &quot;Love Is Gone&quot; as a touching representation of Scrooge's state of mind.  But the fact is that each of the half-dozen or so songs in the movie sets an atmosphere and a mood, and each adds something to the film that would not be there if the song were omitted.<br />The Muppet Christmas Carol can, of course, be seen merely as an introduction to Charles Dickens' famous story (and Gonzo does in fact advise the audience to read the book if they enjoyed the movie).  But I think the film also stands magnificently by itself as a wonderful retelling of this particular Christmas tale.  Either way, it's a Christmas film that is not to be missed, by young or old.  5 stars?  7 or 8 at the very least!
B00004XONN|5.0|Some people just won't get this album. Not because it's over their heads or they don't understand, but because we all have different tastes. I doubt anyone who bought a Radiohead album has the same shallow taste as that of people who listen to Britney or Backstreet, so give them some credit. As to the people who say this album is heralded just because of Radiohead's name, that's not true. I never liked Radiohead, but I became interested in them because of the 15 second blurbs on MTV2. I thought that if any band was that original, think of the music they could make. So I picked up Kid A. And listened. And listened some more. Now, many people have said it has to grow on you. Not with me. I loved it on the first listen. It's ambigiuous, complex, dark, and emotional all at the same time. Since I bought this, I also bought OK Computer, which is even better, just because I like the songwriting a bit more on that one. Overall, I think Radiohead is emerging as one of the greatest rock bands on the planet not just by making great rock music, but by making great rock music with non-rock methods.
0790743213|5.0|This film improves through multiple viewings.  This seems impossible, because it makes such an excellent first impression.  Because there are so many good things to say about the film, I'll narrow the list.<br />This role gave Grant the ability to show diversity beyond his usual aplomb.  He plays a clever man accustomed to being in complete control, only to unexpectedly be thrust into life-and-death circumstances with no one to help him.  We are left to discover how clever the character really can be, as well as how well Grant could really act.<br />There are moments when he evokes genuine feelings.  For example, in a scene when villains force him onto a couch, there is suddenly real fear in Cary Grant's eyes.  It is amazing to watch this film create and maintain this kind of tension.<br />Aside from excellent performances from a skilled cast, the film also presents an example of Hitchcock at some of his best:  using innovative camera-work without letting it intrude into the flow of the story.<br />This is an accomplished action film - all film lovers should watch this film ... and then watch it again.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was recommended to me by a few of my friends.  On the back, it is compared to Catcher in the Rye.  While it may deal with the same topic--a young person trying to understand the world--I felt the similarities end there.  Perks is a magnificant book that I read in a single night.  Charlie's simple, unassuming style (in both the writing and the plot) is intriguing and fascinating.  He is called &quot;a wallflower&quot; because he sits quietly, observing life, like a wallflower.  Yet through the many turns and twists this novel takes, we begin to learn the perks--and problems--of being a wallflower.  In the end, Stephen Chbosky speaks to us about overcoming our past and living with the present, dealing with our lives moment by moment.  This book will keep you turning the pages, but by the end it has done far more than simply entertain.  Warning: this book does contain some material that may not be appropriate for younger children.  However, I would hesitate to prevent a teenager from reading this; as one myself, I know that it resonated with my life and provided many interesting ideas.
B000002AZ8|5.0|this is the very first cd that i ever bought when i was 14.  I had gotten a cd player for christmas, and my uncle took me to buy a compact disc, and i had nooooooooo idea what to get.  All I could remember is that i had heard of pearl jam, so i bought it. I listened to it once, and once again, and again and again and again.....................I could not stop listening to the only cd i had, but now that I have over 100 cd's, the very best cd i have ever bought.  The music alone without the lyrics are the best ever, and then of course you add eddie vedder's all inspiring lyrics and it's the best album by pearl jam and one of the best of rock ever.
B00000DI06|5.0|I absolutely adore Rutter's Requiem. This is easily the finest recording of some of the best religious music of this century. Having perfomed this piece locally, I can assure you that it is carried out with technical perfection. Everything is as beautiful and gripping as the composer intended it to be. Usually, when I am exposed to piece this much, I grow tired of it. Not so with Rutter's Requiem. I am spellbound every time I hear it. This is the sort of album that will do more than enrich your music collection; it will enrich your life.
B00003CXA6|2.0|...and that is my biggest problem with this movie, hence only two stars.  Unlike the Movie produced by Turner, General Lee was far from confused about his invasion of the North in 1863.  And while he did rely heavily on Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry for his intelligence and to screen the main Army's movements, Turner made it look as though Stuart's absence was one of the main reasons for the Confederate defeat...which certainly wasn't the case.  And Lee wasn't without Cavalry, as Gen. Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry was on hand.  Another problem I had was this movie also made Longstreet look more brilliant and even-headed than Lee.  While Longstreet was an able commander, especially at the Corps and Division level, he was no Lee.<br />I enjoyed the story line and the focus on the first day's actions with Maj. General John Buford holding Seminary Ridge against overwhelming odds.  I also enjoyed Jeff Daniels' portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain, and his speech prior to the action on Little Round Top.  And Pickett's Charge made me weep.  But, my Southern Pride (I was born in Tennessee and raised in Kentucky) was stung by the confused and indecisive prortrayal of Lee by Martin Sheen (someone seemed to forget that General Lee was over six feet tall and rather angular, Sheen being considerably shorter and less angular...).  General Lee certainly did have a reason for invading the North and wasn't as confused as portrayed in this film.<br />Besides General Lee's portrayal, a very Historically accurate film, and good entertainment.
0930073193|5.0|This book is usually listed by free-market advocates as one of the five books to read first.  Henry Hazlitt writes with unequaled clarity.  He outlines that basics of many fundamental ideas--the price system, inflation, government subsidies, minimum wage, and others.  He uses pure logic and reasoning almost exclusively, only providing statistics as sidenotes to the main point.  However, the book's strength is also its weakness.  While he makes a tremendous intellectual defense of free market economics, it by no means complete.  I would recommend this to any beginning libertarian or free market advocate; it will provide many strong points for further contemplation and research.  However, a Keynesian advocate will still be able to question certain ideas.  Yet, any intellectually honest statist should read it, because Hazlitt does present his arguments cogently, clearly, and with power.  One note: a more seasoned free market economist may wish to consider this book a medium priority, because it may be somewhat basic to someone familiar with classic arguments.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|One of the first metal cds i have ever owned, this will always stand out in my mind. it remains one of my favorites to this day. i must say, the British really knew how to rock(and still do!) These songs are all heavy and earth-shattering, especially &quot;Prophecy&quot; and &quot;Clairvoyant&quot;, with a pounding bass intro. i have a feeling that this cd will remain one of my favorited until the day i die. it never sounds old and i never get tired of it. Simply put, this is a masterpiece that you must buy now if you like good classic heavy metal. UP THE IRONS!
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes is a well written memoir about the struggles of a young boy growing up in Ireland. Frank McCourt uses aching sadness and desperate humor to tell the true story of his life. The story is told in first person point of view, which is why this story has so much detail and is so heartwarming. This book has parts that are kind of disgusting, yet without them the story would loose it's them. The book would probably not suit everyone's taste but it is a book everyone should read to help them understand that no struggle is too hard to overcome. Frank McCourt tells the story in such a way that you feel as if you're there struggling with him and although the story has many struggles and sadnesses, it has humor to balance all this out.

This book explains how you can identify what that mysterious thing is! And understand what it takes to please yourself as well. Finally I get proof for not being self-indulgant for always saying &quot;I only do the dishes because I love you&quot; (ok, that was before I bought a dishwasher, but anyway...)<br />A much simpler theory and approach than the Mars and Venus books - a worthy complement. And easier to follow. It will not solve all your problems (like when we guys want to dig deep into our caves and run away for some time) but it is one hell of a good start!
B00003CXDG|4.0|MI:2 provided a great visual expierence.  It was good that Cruise did most of his own stunts.  It added a lot to the movie!  The DVD has some very nice features, including the &quot;Impossible Shots&quot; portion, that shows how they did many of the big stunts in the movie.  <br />The music selection for the film was done quite well.  The move from the more traditional Mission Impossible music, to music by Limp Bizkit and Metallica added to the action scenes.  I wish they had the Orchestrator of MI:2 do a commentary on the music and the process of choosing it (like on the Matrix DVD).<br />Overall, the movie was done very well, and deserves being watched several times.  Kudos to Mr. Woo for his marvelous directing, and to Cruise who did some absolutely incredible stunts!
B00004Y6RO|4.0|I bought this digipak after buying the original about 6 months earlier. And yes, this CD is one of the best CD's I've ever heard. But I suggest you buy the regular version. You pay a lot less for all the good tracks. The bonus tracks aren't that great, well, except for the live version of &quot;Surfacing&quot;. If you want to know about the album, check my other review. This is just warning people not to waste your money on the digipak.
0312955006|5.0|Quite possibly the best detective/crime book I have read, and I have read many. Connelly is a superb storyteller with a gift for gritty description and capturing dialogue. His characters are believable and have no hint of the &quot;I'm going to make a fatally-flawed hero to make him appear realistic&quot; mentale that currently pervades this genre. Original, exciting, refreshing and a taut read. Don't start it unless you are prepared to read it in one sitting.
B00003CXIY|1.0|I like movies like this.  I always have.  Sophomoric jokes, disgusting humor, those are my kinds of movies. And while this one had both of those in supply, it also had too much boredom. i sat there waiting for something to happen, wishing that the film wouldn't be so predictable and unfunny. If anyone recommends this film to you, rent it and beware.  It's got some funny scenes, but it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
B00000IAU3|4.0|In my old neck of the woods, I'd actually heard Dido on a alternative radio station out of Austin with the hauntingly beautiful, ethereal &quot;Here With Me&quot; track, but my family back in NM knew the song only as the &quot;Roswell&quot; theme.  So you can imagine my surprise when I came back home and started rifling through my Dad's CD collection; there she was.  I immediately popped the CD into a player and was totally blown away.  Her wry lyrics on &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot;, and deceptively complex harmonies on &quot;Thank You&quot; make this album a real find.  If you examine the other lyrics and songs closely, you'll see they come from a wise heart that knows the ebb and flow of love, and that it doesn't have to come only in saccharine pop-tart flavors such as Britney or Christina.
0553106635|2.0|I solemnly declare that, as I write this, I am of sound mind, and not under the influence of any mind-altering chemicals. I'm only on my first cup of coffee, so we can't even blame caffeine for what I'm about to say.<br />This book, and this series, are mediocre at best. All these five-star reviews worry me, because this installment certainly didn't rate it. To deal in brass tacks, Martin's best aspect is his willingness to kill off main characters. It's a relief to be rid of a few people. He writes adequately. But this is going on too long, and I just don't care enough about these people (any of them) to want to read yet another 800 pages.<br />I see that this series is scheduled for six books. Please, no!<br />Look, guys, didn't any of you stay awake during your western civ courses, or your European history? Martin is playing with, and severely compressing, the Wars of the Roses. I don't mind, except that I'm tired to death of all these reviews raphsodizing over Martin's world-building. It's quite, quite recognizeable.<br />Now, for these people comparing the Lord of the Rings and this stuff...<br />Pay attention: Lord of the Rings is roughly 1200 pages. In those pages, you are presented with a world that is both recognizeable and exotic. There is heroism, and the vilest treachery, and small figures who achieve greatness. The reader is presented with a profound, wise, tolerant worldview in beautiful, lyrical, and what's more, appropriate, language. So many of us have grown up on Tolkien, we don't appreciate how extraordinary he was. More, many readers don't realize how incredibly erudite he was, and how internalized his knowledge. Middle Earth is Tolkien's personal codification of the literature and history he studied. Because most of us are pig-ignorant of that literature and history, and Tolkien's sources, we don't understand his accomplishment.<br />Middle Earth is not a Manichean universe, as one reviewer insisted. That's an over-simplification brought on by superficial reading and Tolkien's gift for drawing us into sympathy with the protagonists. Remember, Frodo does not succeed in destroying the Ring. Gollum/Smeagol bites off the finger the Ring is on, and falls to his death, taking the Ring with him. Gandalf, the personification of &quot;good&quot;, rallies and encourages the leaders of the West. But who destroys the ring-wraith king? Merry, a hobbit who hasn't done much else in the whole book except be cheerful and brave.<br />Anyway, those are mere examples of what is great in Tolkien. By comparison, Martin's books are pitiful.<br />In 2400 pages and counting, what have we seen? Muddled human beings, and what's more, people I, at least, can't care for. Who cares who dies? By the time I was half-way through this volume, not me. I'm tired of the whole thing. I want it over with. Unless there's a republican revolution, this stuff is boring.<br />Martin has done his best to make some characters more sympathetic. We're supposed to change our view of certain characters because they have larger concerns than their own hides. Guess what? Everyone does, and it doesn't make them virtuous. And there is nothing, nothing happening in this book that justifies - gulp - 4800 pages.<br />We don't need to kill this many trees. Let's start encouraging authors to finish their work in a reasonable space.
6305265666|4.0|Possibly the best film I have seen Drew Barrymore in, as of late (&quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; takes a different turn on the estrogen kick.) She is a completely pro-active heroine, and that is SO appealling and much more interesting to watch over the more traditional self-abnegating Cinderella character we are familiar with. Of course, she has wonderful support- from Anjelica Huston (deliciously evil as the stepmother), Patrick Godfrey as an adorable Leonardo DaVinci, Dougray Scott as the Prince, and veteran actress Jean Moreau, who plays her great-great-great granddaughter, narrating the story for the record to the &quot;Brothers Grimm.&quot; Beautifully filmed, simple story-telling and fairly accurate costuming make for an enchanting couple of hours.
B0000047CX|5.0|This is a real all-time classic CD. Rarely, the combination of non Brazilian Jazz and Samba musicians suggests this level of sophistication, rhythm and delicate energy. The recording appeals both to people that don't really like Jazz, and to real Jazz fans. Buy it! You will not regret.
0441172717|5.0|Dune has one of the most intricately complex worlds I've seen in any book.  The characters are richly detailed, and you can almost see the desert landscape.  Herbert does an excellent job of describing the characters feelings and motivations, and whether you know of his writing this as an allegory or not, it's still an incredible book.  I highly recommend it.
B00001NFCY|4.0|I love don't care what anyone says..I think 'Human Clay' is a great CD. Lots of meaningful songs..music you can relate to. I'm getting tired of hearing songs that refer to women as &quot; ho's&quot; and songs that glorify pain and hate. This CD was really cool..not at all prissy or lame. It peacefully kicked, ripped and roared!  I admit..this is my first Creed CD..certainly not my last. I don't know who does the singing..but you gotta love that voice!
0790751305|5.0|After 57 other posts, there isn't much for me to add.  It's agreat film, even if the themes of heroism and gunplay get a bitmuddled toward the end.  (I mean, regardless of what he does, Eastwoodgunning people down will always be the American male moviegoer's ideaof a hero.  He may talk about killing women and children, but noticewe never see him do it.  And the most shocking bit of violence, hisrandom shooting of one survivor as Eastwood is leaving the saloon atthe end, is always cut by ABC television, thus reinforcing this idea.)Hackman is superb as a villain who believes in his righteousness andthe righteousness of upholding the law.  It's the complex gray layersthat he gives to his characters that makes him the best we have today.(How do you feel about his Avery Tolar in &quot;The Firm&quot;?  Youcan't help but have mixed feelings.)  The pacing and structure, mixedwith the precision of the curiously dated language, create a spellthat holds you until the very end.  Without these, it might have beena very ordinary film indeed.  One thing, though -- I know that it'sracist nowadays to insist that any actor can't play any characterbecause of the difference in race or nationality.  But didn't itstrike you as just a bit disorienting and unrealistic to see Hackmanwhipping a black man (Morgan Freeman) in the old West and have it havenothing to do with race?
6305922748|5.0|This is the film that can make me soil myself over and over again.  Clever cameos from Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, and Paul Shaffer are just the tip of the iceburg.  Anyone with an appreciation for Zeppelin's &quot;Song Remains the Same&quot; and other rockumentaries will have a ball with this film.  The lyrics are a trasure-trove of obscene innuendo, Ringo-like euphamisms, and senseless combinations of bizarre phrases.  It's a wonder that they never took a Grammy for &quot;Big Bottom&quot;, where, as any Taphead knows, &quot;the bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin'&quot;.  Buy this film and laugh your &quot;bottom&quot; off!
0784011613|3.0|Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant and Moira Kelly is (briefly and gloriously) naked.  That's all you really need to know if you're looking forward to anything.  Otherwise, another dull by-the-numbers biopic from Attenborough.
B0000025DD|5.0|For the price this is a must have in your collection.  Away from Roger Waters dreary influence, Gilmour cruises freely through some beautiful licks.<br />It's all the joy of Pink Floyd without the bleak outlook.<br />Seriously, David Gilmour plays a mean guitar and this CD is a real nice way of appreciating it without all of Pink Floyd's bells and whistles (and pigs, and alarm clocks, helicopters, and screaming babies, and explosions...)<br />..all right, I love Pink Floyd too!<br />I'd compare this album most closely to Obscured By Clouds if you are looking for a Pink Floyd parallel.
6304308388|5.0|One of the few truly great movie moments for me (great in terms of the shorthand Wilder and Diamond employ in letting a single shot replace what could be additional exposititory dialogue, and great in the thump I get in my chest every time I see it): the broken compact mirror.  Not the first time we see it--the second time.  That and the moment in &quot;Rear Window&quot; when Burr looks up from Grace Kelly's hand straight into the camera are my two favorites.<br />This isn't exactly a review of the entire movie, but I hope it piques your curiosity.
