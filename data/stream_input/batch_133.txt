B001NQKH76|5|Have put several of these in the garage and the men seem to get a great kick out of them.
B000F5JMEA|2|the design could easily have included a longer pin(s) on one side to justify for the thickness of the offset arm. pins being the same length makes for setting the tool at an angle when using it. such a shame as everything else is well executed.
B00CLBTHJ6|5|Theses r so nice! Very high quality. Ordered a set for the front, then got another for the back when we saw how cool they were!
B00DY4HSDG|5|Great helmet
B000GTUM9O|4|Quick installation. Seems to be solid. As described.
B000KL1FJE|5|Durable, keeps spilled liquids/melted snow & ice within liner. Since I purchased, I've not had to have car floors shampooed, only lightly vacuumed.
B000CK5QTI|4|I haven't installed these yet on my 2004 Honda Civic VP, but they ended up costing a total of $9 after the rebate, which I got yesterday in the mail. So, I'm happy with the purchase.
B009WUIQXC|5|These are a perfect fit. Easy to install. Well worth the money. I would recommend to anyone interested in guards.
B0002SA316|5|I bought this for my husband and he loves it.
B00062ZJ4O|1|Does not fill or conceal nicks w/ color, just dries black instead of white, otherwise waxes as expected.  No advantage, could have used regular wax on hand with same results.
B00MIZTAK6|5|This is so awesome, I love it. It's adorable, discreet and really heavy duty! Will definitely inflict a ton of pain if needed.
B00OZ13PSE|5|Absolutely fanominal ! Sounds very deep and looks great. I have a K&N air filter as well, and after I added the exhaust it lost a little throttle respond but shouldn't be too hard to correct with a power commander. Also, said it would take 2 - 4 business days to process before shipping, but it arrived within two days! Very pleased with this purchase.
B008BYQBVY|5|Works great but cable is a bit to thin in diameter and shows signs of wear with little use.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Installed on a 99 TJ Wrangler - 2 on the bumper and 2 on windshield brackets.  Other than having some wiring issues with the final run into the switch, these were a straight forward install and they are SUPER bright.  Son is very excited to have these on his Jeep.
B000CMHVGC|5|Pleased with purchase
B00651CLCS|5|Easy to install the new antenna had to take the factory antenna off which was easy to take off. The new antenna looks great on my Jeep.
B00NIWR4I8|3|It does hold cargo firmly in place however there are only three mount points for this system. (The three upper oval points) I wish it was a sliding system with more adjustments.
B00A48FBXY|4|This is the only bulb that suitable for my 2007 merc ml350 license plate. Brightness is just right for me. Do not want it too bright to become an attention for the police.
B00LVTZLU8|4|They are nice! but remember they are metal so lube them up or they will corrode themselves to your valve stems and cause major problems.
B00QU78QE4|4|Was not for me, installed and works fine...
B003I4XN68|3|I bought these for my husband for Christmas.  He did some research and liked these ones.  It said they would fit his truck and he liked them so I ordered them.  He went to put them on and realized that they actually didn't fit.  Two of the side panels were too short.  He put them on anyway but I am disappointed.
B001KSEJBW|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 Elantra
B0028ZKMM6|5|This worked perfectly.  Easy to install on my 2006 Yamaha Roadstar Midnight Silverado!
B003MRJ7AC|4|The key chain is cute and is of decent quality. It scratches pretty easily and is smaller than the key fob for the car. At first the size bothered me but I hardly notice it anymore and I've only had ti for a month. I feel like it should be a couple dollars cheaper ($7/$8) considering the size and how light it is. Overall I think it's cute and I'm happy I bought it.
B00J5SYPEA|5|Excelente producto
B000EQR7XS|4|Very nice fitment. No issues with the installation. Works great!
B0091YV1F4|5|Received these in just two days and they work great. Nice color of blue and they illuminate the gauge cluster of my 1995 Honda Passport well and I wanted to change to blue to match my stereo's illumination. However be advised that this has made the needles of the gauges, particularly the speedo and tach, very hard to see. They obviously designed the cluster to be illuminated by green and thus the needles were made to pass green light and be lit up against the background, orange over green. The blue isn't filtering well into the needles so their orange is now invisible.<br />Probably takes a back seat to most folks who would want blue overall or like me want the gauges to match a piece of equipment they added. If I wasn't trying to do that and did it again I'd stick with the factory scheme.
B00J73E87M|5|Install was easy, like 10 minutes on my 2004 Chev 2500 pickup truck.
B008ZFKEBW|5|GOOD QUALITY COMES WITH INSTRUCTIONS VERY EASY TO MOUNT WHY MAKE A DEALER DO IT COST IS MUCH HIGHER SAVE YOUR MONEY BUY THEM HERE.
B000ICV8XS|5|I like the horns they are well made, heavy duty even. They are not that loud at all, you can barely hear them with my diesel truck running and I have the hose to the compressor under 8\\" no kinks, I will be upgrading to compressed air tank system anyway so not a big deal, but I still thought they would be a little louder.<br /><br />!!!UPDATE!!! 2/22/14 I bought a compressor at Harbor Freight for 39 dollars and also bought a solenoid on here for 20 and a 2000 watt inverter for 75 on here as well, also the inverter has a remote that I bought seprate so I can turn it on and off whenever; I just put it in the center console. TALK ABOUT LOUD! I could tell many story's about how loud it is. With this setup I am louder than all other train horns out there and there are a lot down here the valley of the sun(except the real train horns that are over a 1000 dollars). So now I have on board air and enough power to light a home or run multiple power tools at once. The compressor is also good enough to air up any size tire and even run air tools. I am sure these horns are way more quality than any other out there I can see the difference when people ask me what they are and we compare. These are three years and going strong. I have a f350 longbed crewcab so all this fits perfect under the bed. If you have a large truck, this is the setup for you. All my buddies are jealous; and I use the air and the power all the time; and it all started with just these horns. Thanks again Amazon
B008EWPHZE|4|the product is good, no problrma in the installation
B000JNG0HU|4|I purchased this product on Amazon over a year ago and it never fails to work and charge my battery properly and quickly. I only wish the cables were longer so that I could rest the charger on the ground while the battery recharges even for just a few minutes. The work light also comes in very handy. The charger can also power up other smaller items as well. Good product overall.
B0054EMVWW|1|This is the knock off version of the Stebel horn. Fell apart out of the box. Skip it, you be pleased you did.
B004MGND34|5|Like it
B004ZF39T0|3|Fit my 98 Tahoe. Can't complain much as they are nearly as cheap as a regular set of bulbs. I was under the impression that these bulbs would give me greater distance than normal one's but that doesn't seem to be the case. They give me greater field of vision(width) and the natural colored light is something to get used to but once you do it is better than a normal bulb. It is almost like staring into a computer screen for a long time it gives your eyes the same feeling when using these lights. This particular model has a cheap feeling to them the bracket that comes with them will not accept all three screws on the ballast at the same time due to the bracket being punched off center. They have lasted this long and I have not got any of the delay or flickering some reviews were talking about. We will see if they stand the test of time, I will be back to edit this if they don't. Other than that they are practically easy to install simple plug and play, had some difficulty with this as the snap went on backwards where it doesn't lock not sure if this is my fault or manufacturing would have tried switching sides with the ballast but I had already had to do it three times each time having to remove my battery in order to get to one of the bulbs while I was freezing in the snow. I would suggest if you have a tahoe try doing the driver side first and see which one of the ballast fits right with the snap in the locked position if either of them do before you mount them and move on to removing the battery to get to the passenger side. Also thought I would mention these are the small/mini ballast and not the large ones. Oh and the instructions are a bad joke at best so if you buy these don't depend on the instructions to inform you on how to install these...
B009SEJO4W|4|haven't used product yet, but it seems to be what I wanted - and nice that it came with careful instructions for proper use
B00BCPIR98|5|original part ,fast delivery,fit perfect
B005HMJIIQ|5|Received interior lights and reverse lights, all functioned and are very bright
B004QO13FC|5|Good quality part. Gives the exhaust a throaty sound. Sounds great and has no issues. Installation was very easy only took about 20mins.
B0026FCGOA|5|Like it
B00B9IKDXQ|1|Description said fits 07 civic . lies
B0012TZ04E|5|I'm that crazy guy out running in -5*. This keeps my head and face warm. Seems are holding well after many washes and a year of use. I do suggest.
B00099DW6G|2|Batteries were shipped new, but are dated almost a year old already and have a 1 year warranty ... granted from the time of purchase, but do not like my odds.  Going to return them.
B001KW4YA4|5|Worked fine.
B000CGP19C|3|Pros:<br />The friction material on these pads are nice as you would expect with Akebono.  Like most ceramics, there is less initial bite but then there is strong stopping power.  I prefer that feel to overly &#34;grabby&#34; pads.  As others have mentioned, dusting is very low and the pads are also fairly quiet. Ceramics are also very gentle on rotors.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The clips on these are poorly designed and need to be bent into shape before the pads can be installed.<br /><br />The casting on the plates is also very sloppy and I had to file mine down substainally before they would even fit into the calipers.
B001BAFHGA|5|This does what it's supposed to do and looks good. If the hardness of your steering wheel hurts your hands over time, this should help a lot.
B00HD0ZP82|5|A great all season helmet regardless of sport (ATV, snowmobile, motorcycle, motocross). Many premium features at an economy price. Flip-up face shield provides the rider with more options for eye protection types and choices than an open face helmet along with better protection from the elements and debris.
B000F0Z7NA|1|Absolutely the worst product I have ever wasted my money and time on. Maybe they sent me the wrong cover but after reading their literature I am convinced its just poorly made. I repeat, the worst
B004UZNC60|2|Didn't fit seat good felt cheap and looked like it too. I bought them for my daughter and she hated them, so returned them and got  my money back.
B0030IMXHM|5|I use this to mount my phone to my car to use my Google Navigation. It makes mounting and dismounting an easy, one handed approach. All you have to do is   1. attach the included  metal peice (various sizes) to the phone or navigation unit   2. attach the magnet to the car's vent which is handled by a vice that grabs a blade of the vent  the mount's magnet will grab the metal peice on the back of the phone. The magnet is very strong. A bumpy ride will not disconnect the phone from the mount. The magnet does not affect the phone in any way.  Personally, I did not like the idea of the phone blocking the vent, especially in the winter when i am using heat since being directly in front of it makes the phone hot. So i superglued the mount elsewhere on the car's dash. It holds very well. Also I noticed that the magnet's connection is stronger than it's vice that grips the vent. So sometimes if i pulled the phone straight away from the magnet, the entire mount would come off. That was annoying. The super glue solved this problem. I also super glued the metal peice to my phone's case slightly off center so taht the phone can lay on a flat surface and not see-saw.  This is amazing and I will never mount my Android powered phone any other way!
B001BFODG0|5|Put these on our 3.5SE Altima Coupe about 6 months ago. Fantastic! No warping, still clean with no rust. I could tell when I opened them up that they were quality made. Just remember to clean off with a good soup and water scrub down before you install with new pads. I used Hawk Performance pads with these rotors.
B000EPZTZC|4|Used as an upgrade/modification for a 99 C1500 and worked great.
B003C0173E|4|Great but smaller than I expected. I am a budget racer and was looking for a slightly larger catch can than I was running. Well, this is a slightly smaller one. But it looks amazing, and i already had it powder coated to match the engine work. Turned out excellent. Works pretty god too.<br />I purchased it cheaper than is currently listed, but I still feel at current price it is a bargain.
B00KQWMH2G|5|The best stuff since sliced bread. It's pricey but well worth it!
B000CMHNY2|5|nice option
B0063UIGI4|2|The shirt was delivered promptly but the quality of the shirt was poor.  The image was so faded that I ended up throwing it away instead of wearing it.
B00BJXW4QK|1|I was not happy with the mirrors at all but then again I guess I got what I paid for... trash.
B00C0UECXO|5|This part arrived a day early and was half the price of the one I could have bought locally at an auto parts shop.  I have a 2004 Grand Prix that with electric windows that wouldn't raise or lower reliably.  This was exactly what was I needed at the right price.
B005UQZ09K|5|Good! AWESOME PERFECT LOVE IT!!!!
B00493RJZI|5|Excellent replacement at half the dealer price!
B009DJY4J2|5|Perfect looks great
B00NZQMA90|5|It worked
B002TMQ4AM|5|custom ,snug fit.....we'll see how it does this winter as far as keeping snow and mud retained and off the carpet.........it's been almost a year and these mats perform awesomely....protects carpeting very well...would purchase again if needed
B00D1CQVIY|5|excellent product
B000JJHNAW|5|It sincerely increases shelf life of fuel. Especially ATVs Motorcycles lawnmowers stored for winter vehicles. I put it in my mustang every winter. And when I fire it up in the spring runs like I just put fresh fuel in it!
B000C91F0S|3|i have to cut it to small size
B000E2AJ5U|5|This thing is everything that the picture showed and we are very pleased with our purchase, which came with a super price tag!!!<br /><br />I did some research on real auto websites that sold this same product to ensure it would fit our truck, and it fits great!  I have listed our vehicle below:<br /><br />2003 Ford F-150, V8, not a special edition of anything, 4 door crew cab, regular size bed, spare tire mounted underneath the truck toward the bumper<br /><br />Now we were comparing a couple of these hitch's online that came up as compatible with our truck...HOWEVER, keep in mind of your spare tire.  The one that we almost bought had a straight bar on the back, as opposed to this one with the curved bar--you know, in order for it to fit around the spare tire.<br /><br />So do your homework people!!!  Take note of the make and model of the hitch, google it, and check it out on auto zone, o'reillys, etc. just to ensure you are getting something that will be compatible with your truck.  After that, happy shopping!<br /><br />I know a lot of people say this is easier to install with someone helping you, but my boyfriend was home alone at the time and wanted to get it done, so it is possible to do it by yourself.  He said it was easy to install and went fairly quickly.<br /><br />Hope this helps you guys shopping for this product.  :)
B005GRGOGG|5|Best part of my Car . Dropped it in an Fired Right Up. The Price was amazingly low and Performance Was High .
B0009H519Y|5|My daughters father bought a jar years ago.  I found it and used every drop as it SPARKLED my jewelry like no other.  I use it on many things.  It is the best.  Glad I found it here.
B00E4QHN0Q|3|Mine came with a dent on it (like it was poked with something sharp)
B000E3EXH4|5|These are really good quality for the price. Fit beautifully. Have on my driver's seat in my 99 Honda Accord and my 08 Tacoma. Would recomment to all.
B003IME3IW|5|Works as expected, high quality tool that should last for quite awhile. Have used it once and I am impressed w/the results.
B007RVQZUY|5|These are the ones to buy. They are solid!
B0006N5RYK|5|It was a perfect fit for our new camper. It was very easy to attach and the quality is good.
B0002KO3AG|4|Fantastic fender cover for the money.  It's not the best ever, but for the price it's way better than I expected.  No complaints yet.
B004SRRELY|5|I think they are expensive for what they are but 1. They are more expensive everywhere else 2. When they are in and I'm recirculating airflow through them my allergies don't kick in so it's worth the money for me. Perfect fit for 2012 Wrangler
B000EJS9IM|5|Love this thing. Air compressor works great. Nice when I had a slow leak in my tire. I'd just leave it in the trunk I case it got low before I could get to a gas station. Power for camping and jump starter. Best purchase ever although I wish it had 2 ac outlets like the previous model.
B000K36BCI|1|bad brand , difficult to use and it is very easy to damage.
B0033QNZZ0|5|Same quality as Mercedes-Benz antifreeze
B004MEH78S|5|This product worked very well when I was polishing the headlamps on the family cars. No problems whatsoever. I would purchase again.
B000GOJWKE|5|great product, worked perfect, fast shipper,  used to replace oem motor that was original in car.  fit perfect and electrical connection matched.
B000EBKG90|5|Love these jumbo shades.  They work well for large car windows, and keep the sun from buring the car seats.  I have used them regularly during the summer, and will need to purchase more.
B007USCM7E|1|This is a waste of money and time. I recharged my car using this and I noticed leaks coming out of the trigger, connector to the can, and connector adaptor for the low line. Drips of freon coming out. Recheck seals and can but everything was tightly assembled. System was half full because everything else escaped. Sooo disappointing. For the amount of money this is so not worth it. Never will buy anything from this manufacturer.
B001FC79EW|5|Only way to fill the coach batteries.
B005XGZ9KM|2|They took like a month to get to me from China, which was alright if they looked like they do in the picture.  They definitely are a little less attractive in person.  Basically the &#34;Jeep&#34; lettering is really thin and looks foreign.  I wouldn't buy these again.  Found some other ones on here that come in a little black case - they are silver with a black background and white &#34;Jeep&#34; lettering - they came in a couple of days, had very nice presentation, and the word &#34;Jeep&#34; looks the way someone in North America would actually expect it to..
B007HRB15C|4|Locks worked great . I installed them on a 07 cobalt ls . Had to remove some sound dampening plastic but went in smooth and worked great . Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is hardware that came with it was not very stable . Had to get some small bolts and nuts that cost 2.50 so no big deal . Great product thinking of getting another for my truck .
B0067UD54K|5|Good quality new gasket no mounting bolts though
B005FKRB70|3|Update to my Review: Had to contact their customer service. was getting a rattling noise in the passenger rear tire area. Finally root caused it to the brakes. Contacted their customer service to see if they've had any complaints or know issues with the fit of their pads with my 2005 Mazda 3.  Didn't get the type of response I was looking for. Based off that I've knocked it down to 3  Received the set today. Installed them on my 2005 mazda 3 today. Kit came with rotors, pads, and replacement caliper boots and dust caps....Everything fit like a gem and part quality was very nice. Can't speak for durability yet but after a few drives today I'm really happy with the purchase.
B001DEPOLC|5|I already own two metal cases before this one, I use them to carry my laptops and camera equipment (lens, batteries, etc...) and I spent between $150-$300(each) on my previous two. I bought this case for a prop in a indie production we are working on, when i received, I was shocked at how sturdy it is! Spec-wise, I do not see a real difference between it and my high-end cases. The pockets are a little cheap and I do not think they will last long if used frequently, but other than that, this case is well made and amazing for the price. Best purchase I have made in a long time, when production is done, I will probably start using this for my equipment toting as well. I recommend this product.
B005PPODU8|1|cheap. poorly made. incorrectly made. not proportioned. not good quality at all. this is a very cheap item that looks bad and is poorly made
B000E4OKEE|5|I ordered this mirror for my 2002 Chevy s10, looks and fits just like the origenal. I had gone to the agency first and the mirror was $80 their. Found it on Amazon. Great price!!
B000EVWELI|5|This item was a great purchase. It did everything I expected and then some. As good or better than the high priced guys.
B00062ZY3K|5|A very good product by K & N, the only problem is knowing the correct size to get for the filter you have, Amazon does not always have the correct size or the model number, so be sure to get the right information before ordering, I called K&N to get the right model number.
B008AFJUCQ|3|It looks like suede but it is not. At a closer look the material looks cheap and not durable. For this price I expected the outer material to be leather.<br />The sole was stiffer than I expected it to be. I was planning to use these shoes for comfortable walking (like sneakers). Of course, for riding purposes you may want this.<br /><br />Overall: If the outer material would have be leather I would have kept the shoes.
B005N53CBQ|5|Wonderful auto seat cover.  Cool in a hot climate.  A little too large (long) for my Mitsubishi Outlander but I can fix that easily so don't  mind it at all considering how good it is all around.
B000E4OMXI|4|It is well made item. It fits as good as the OEM. I feel this is a quality product for the price.
B00JFEU63S|4|Got the silver drawstring bag as described, however, there is no logo silkscreened as pictured... it is the same color as my new Coverking car cover, but minus one star since it's a little small and even when well rolled, the cover barely fits in the bag.  For the price, it's a nice storage bag.
B00029J3AW|1|Had it installed on my 2014 Dodge Charger SXT. It produced a horrible droning sound at two thousand rpm. If you're thinking about using on a Charger don't do it. I'm having my stock mufflers put back on.
B000C5A044|5|Was told by the Mazda dealer new lower ball joints were required on my truck. The front end parts and labor are very expensive. Got a friend and a loaner ball joint removal tool at the auto parts store and repaired it myself on afternoon. Do yourself a favor and purchase a cheap impact wrench. Replaced the upper control arm as well at the same time. the Moog parts are way better than the standard parts furnished from the dealership. Also get a grease gun and lube the ball joints on installation.
B000KL1A2Q|5|Fit like original, exactly as described.
B008D6HMQ8|5|Even after being stored for months over the winter with less than full tanks, the fuel didnt spoil, and all three of my skis started right up and ran strong on the remaining fuel. Even during the season I see better performance off just 87 octane with them. I am now on my second winter storage, and confident I won't have any fuel related issues using this treatment. Be sure to pick up a Mr. Funnel to prevent any water getting in your tank.... has definitely helped me...
B00GB9SNTE|3|I purchased this unit 10 months ago and I was initially very happy with this purchase and all my friends wanted to install the same lights, the light-bar was a great deal for the price compared to other brands and it served it's purpose mounted to the front of my atv better than I had hoped. I was worried after reading reviews about the wire harness not being water proof that it would short out as we do a lot of off road riding and I never shy away from mud or water so I applied some clear silicon around any possible openings around the switch housing and shrink wrap around the wire ends, then a thin layer around the glass edges as backup assurance. I've put them through a lot and made sure to never directly spray the pressure washer on the switch OR the light unit itself. After our last weekend adventure the switch still works and indicates on and off modes but the light will not power on. For the low cost I suppose I could order a new unit but in my opinion I shouldn't need to replace something every year or less that should be lasting a lot longer than 10 months.....still undecided if I would buy this again.
B000NUVPQA|5|Bought this thing prior to a 3 day, 1800 mile trip from Texas to Florida (and back). Disregard any negative feedback on these cramp busters. Took me about 3 seconds to get familiar with how it works, where its comfortable, and how to quickly spin it out of the way for local \\"normal\\" throttle use. For the money , these items do a great service. Even to just rest your hand... huge help for long stretches of high speed highway miles. While I agree that you need to familiarize yourself with its use prior to going out, I don't agree that there's any danger in using it. Highly recommend em !
B00FGIV6IQ|5|Easy to breathe through and air circulates really well through these mask. Me and my partner share these masks and we both have different sized heads and shapes and they fit us both perfectly.
B0002SQZPO|5|works as it designed...good quality low price
B000FW2MBS|1|This product is not one I would recommend. It is so poorly made that the documents slide out. The cardboard packaging doubles as the back, which would be OK if it was black or something, but it's not. The metal clips have rough edges and snagged the fabric of my visor.
B0089CJ9JY|5|good quality, a bit bigger than what I expected
B0031778T0|5|excellen product
B000JSO43M|4|The product is slightly small for the helmet. It doesn't fit easily. The quality of the bag is excelent though.
B001CHFYJW|5|combined with &#34;K&N 77-2570KTK&#34; in a 2007 V10 Econoline E450 Cube van raised my trip average MPG from 8 to 13. That alone warrants 5 stars but it also gives a huge boost to low end torque and HP.
B004IAGNNG|1|My wife and I are running 5 Mac computers, and in the office where I work, 7 of the 9 of us use Macs exclusively. So, this scanner is absolutely no good for us. Weird, seems they'd want to sell us one.
B00BQN5OX8|5|At our local Lordco shop, 1 OEM shock is $70. Here we got a pair for a fraction of the price. They were a perfect fit for our 2007 Honda Pilot. My husband did the installation and he said it was super straight forward.
B007REFW32|4|I get lots of compliments, but my only issue is that it doesn't align with the bottom of my MacBook like in this picture.  It's still cute.
B00KNBBJMY|5|Exactly as deacribed. Arrived as promised.
B0043AV4NK|5|Sounds like an illegal rally car with the silencer off...it's beautiful. And also legitimate  with the silencer on as I have a 3 month old baby and sadly can't be as loud as I want. Point is this product is worth every last cent and I'm a satisfied customer! I've already told multiple  people to invest into this very exhaust setup.
B003S89B1A|5|The key arrived quickly, as advertised, and programming it was easy as pie on a Sunday afternoon in spring when its not too hot out thanks
B000FQ7BFG|4|I really wanted to like these, but they are really just too small to fit most cups into. A can or water bottle fit fine, but big fast food cups do not.
B004N6YRDS|5|Fast shipping great product!
B000YC9FW8|3|I received my three check valves promptly.  This was my second order of this check valve.  The last three I received,  ONE of them was bad and unworkable.  I think they should be tested before sent to customer.  I think the price was OK and they serve the purpose.  I would order again if I am assured they are not defunct.<br />I do not want to send back as the time and cost is too much to mess with.<br />Again,  ONE of the three Valves was bad.<br />Thank you.
B0002RNSKK|5|This is a Great Item and seller is great. Fast shipping!1 Love it!!!  A+++
B001U2D6OO|2|Very little illumination
B0088JR9X6|5|Item as described! Fast Shipping!
B00690ALFE|3|It's less than 3 months and the rubber top is already peeling off.  For the price, this shouldn't do that.
B00KTJ8K54|5|Great price! I checked out the dealership and other sites, and replacement keyless remotes ranged from $50 to over $100. No way would I pay dealership price, when I could get a replacement at this cost. It was extremely easy to program, too. I'm very pleased that this is an option.
B00R5SBHM0|5|very satisfied with. it ty
B001SLHPQM|2|Doesn't fit very well on my Honda Civic 2013. It's loose and I wish I didn't buy it. No thanks
B002K6AAUM|2|ive owned the head lights 2 weeks and ive already had a bulb blow,and the halo have started turning white losing his blue tint.
B009S9RURU|5|Two years later and this decal is still holding up with only minor cracking.  We get a lot of compliments on it too.
B00252KEHK|5|This filter was an exact replacement for the OEM cabin filter on my 2011 MC Justa
B009LZU38Y|4|Great replacement for the flimsy Motorcraft model.
B00685MMKW|1|Wires Were In Wrong Slots Had To Move Them To right One Done By installerNo Ji Go Bye But put
B000XQ9MGE|5|Item works great.  About the only problem is the clamps are too darn big to get a good grip on my motorcycle battery or anywhere on the frame (for the ground.)<br /><br />Other than that, I love it.  Works great, light will probably come in handy one day (or night I guess I should say.)
B0041TQS5M|5|First time I did it. Easy peazy, Not gonna tell you what I paid Honda to replace last one.
B005Z28KWS|4|It is what it is.
B000FQ0H1Q|5|This is a very important part you can no longer get from Jeep.  Without it the shifter is all over the place.  Great replacement product!
B004BACSYG|1|Welds on the flange that connect to the turbo blew after 2 months and the downpipe hanger location was off by about 2 inches. Very low quality.
B00B5HOBDY|4|only problem was that when i got the product i noticed it wasn't an exact copy, the fuel port was on the wrong side but I made it work anyway. it would be nice if were described for those people that like to read instead of looking at the picture.
B0012Q9ZSO|4|Good quality plugs.
B0002UEPVI|5|This stuff always works well IF you get the 100% Silicone.  Some of the other silicone you buy never cures and so never dries.
B004RCIKW2|5|Just the right saying and one that I live by. Great Shipping and good price.  JUST BUT IT AND put it on your care Proudly!!
B00029XI3A|5|The item was easy to install,if your mechanically inclined.Shipment was crazy fast,and now just waiting to see how long this would last against rain,snow,rocks,and debris from the road since its tacked under the rear of my bumper.Ive had a couple of people at houlihans and several places laugh and smile from it which is cool haha.I bought two,just in case for the future but they should never discontinue this item,very helpful and funny.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Does its job very well, good buy.
B00S00HDC0|5|terrific
B00L2T4FIQ|5|Fast shipping!super quality
B00H0QQ1GE|5|Received in perfect condition and my husband was able to install it very easily. Thank you!
B000VU7M4Q|5|Nice and heavy material. Perfect fit
B00BK85EDY|5|Arrived on time and as advertised.  Fits well in a 2010 Maxima trunk and keeps items securely in place.
B0010DXYHW|1|Amazon's databases are wrong.  This does not and will not fit a 2007 - 2008 Toyota Camry with a Hybrid engine.  While it visually looks the same, the length is short by about an inch, so it will not properly filter the air intake.<br /><br />I ended up just going to my local auto store to pick up a generic for about the same price.
B005ETCIO8|3|Bought these bulbs primarily because AGT LED bulbs tend to be of higher quality than the rest and they definitely were!  The bulbs came packaged in pairs in static bags, and the quality of the connections etc were spot on!<br />Only reason for them not being 5 stars is due to the color and brightness of the LEDs.  The color of the bulbs stated they were white, unfortunately they had too much of a blueish tint for my taste.  I wanted a true white LED as you see on factory lexus license plate bulbs, and these were not.  I was also a bit disappointed in the brightness of the bulbs as it doesn't seem to illuminate as well as factory bulbs would.
B005JU61D6|4|Bought the 28\\" and 21\\" Bosch OE ICON Wiper blades from Amazon. Took less than 1 min to install (just took the plastic piece out of the connector on the blade and squeezed it in place per instructions on the back). Both fit perfectly on my 2010 Mercedes-Benz GL450. A little on the heavier side compared to MB's OEM (took star out for that). I bought it because I wanted to try out few brands, this was the first one (next time, will try Trico). I would have liked it to be very comparable to it, but so far, day 1, it works without any issues.
B00180NAWG|5|- Quality gasket, proper fit<br /> - Pre-tacky on one side covered with protective paper (still felt I needed a smear of glycol resistant sealer on the top side anyway)<br /> - Mine came as 10pcs in a resealable bag (*was wondering why so high a price, therefore are actually &#60;$1/pc)<br /> - I don't mind this way of selling, price/count; however, for me, I would have preferred to pay, e.g. $1.50 and just receive 1pc. Having commented that,----there may be good reason to send a few, due to its use. If there had been an issue, I would have been very glad to have a few on hand. Considering that forethought, hoping it was deliberate, and labor cost, silly setbacks, I gave it 5 stars.
B00CB4XQKY|5|Very well constructed. Easy to install. Make sure you have short staples in your staple gun when installing. 1/8&#34; works best.
B00EO4JCVG|5|Very pleased with this license plate. Nice art work.
B003XSYKVQ|5|If you don't have the Ford OEM tailgate step, this aftermarket step is almost a requirement.  Installed on my 2014 F350 XLT.  Took less than an hour.  Make sure you have the 17mm and 21mm sockets and a 3/16 hex key.  Mounting the step bracket to the bumper mount takes a little patience, when put in place it recesses the bolts and makes it a bit tight to get the bolts seated.  All-in-all, once installed it is secure and tucks up under/even the edge of the driver's side bumper.  Use your toe to push it down, top of foot kind of pushes and folds back under.
B001G4Z5J0|5|I had the product shipped to Alaska. It arrived with little packaging damage, which isn't the case with most heavy, bulky packages delivered to Alaska. The product had no damages/scratches. All hardware was in the packaging and was of decent quality. Easily put together, though a torque wrench would have been nice (I just tightened as hard as I could with long handled wrenches.) Easy to carry and install with 2 people but also achievable if you are solo.<br /><br />I used the carrier on the back of a 30' RV to haul a standup freezer (well under the 500lb weight limit.) The carrier went through some of Alaska's and Canada's roughest highways for a total of 4500 miles with no fail to loose bolts or broken welds. Overall nice quality carrier.<br /><br />Tips: buy the tensioner thing that makes the carrier shank snug to the receiver. I used wooden shims with no luck, still lots of play in the receiver. I was recommended plastic shims, but I think I will buy the $5-10 tensioner.
B004PKC2M0|5|I love the show and this sticker looks awesome on my car. Has lasted a few months now, through all sorts of weather.
B003BWAGE4|5|I received a couple sample packets of this product when I made a purchase of some other r v accessory - It worked so well I immediately logged on to Amazon to buy some.  It's neat that you can also use this to freshen your gray water tank.  It's so easy to use - It comes in a powdered form inside a small envelope so there's no worry about spilling smelly colored liquid deodorizer on your toilet, floor or during storage.  My black water tank is on the small side so I only need to use half a packet - I just fold the top of the envelope over a couple of times and stick it under my bathroom sink for the next use.  In the past, with the liquid toilet deodorizers, I had to make sure and prop up partially used bottles inside a plastic container so they wouldn't spill and make a mess or damage things - It's a relief to no longer have to do that plus the RV-Trine Dry works SO much better than any other tank deodorizer I've used.  I did notice an odor starting to build approximately a week and a half after I first poured the treatment into the tank - but it's the middle of summer in the southwest so I don't think that's unusual - plus you would usually have dumped your tank in that amount of time.  I would definitely recommend this product!!!
B00BVQ7FOG|1|thanks
B0028081GK|1|Literally the first time I used (the second tire) the mechanism failed, a small piece fell out and it's now junk. I waited too long to return it, was so unhappy I didn't want to deal with it for a while and it got buried under papers, I am now actually throwing it away. This is not a &#34;great wrench,&#34; this is a cheap POS that anyone who needs a real wrench should not buy or even borrow. I'm thinking hard but can't come up with anything good to say. Avoid and buy a real wrench.
B00032KAK0|5|Best Diamond plate cover I could find at a good price.  I've had it on for 4 months, and no issues.
B000BZJAVE|4|Got these after my Anco winter blades shredded themselves after 1 year of use.  Although they appear to be physically IDENTICAL to the Anco blades, so far they appear to clean the glass better.  Have been running them for about 1 month so far - hope they hold up.  Not giving 5 stars as I'm not convinced the vinyl/rubber wrap designed to keep snow and ice off will be very durable, time will tell.
B004GC1CEG|5|i got tired of going to autozone,and wanted a code reader a woman like me (not very mechanical inclined) could use. this is so easy to use and read and then once you fix problem you are able to clear code from car computer. the price made it perfect and my husband uses it on his 99 ford truck also. i have 02 dodge caravan.
B00GBQ547Q|5|The other online auto parts websites were asking over $500 for this cover (Deuce 2), so this was a pretty good deal.<br /><br />The instructions (esp. the illustrations) aren't the greatest, but there's a couple install videos on Youtube that are helpful.  The cover sits inside of the bedrails and doesn't cover up the stake hole pockets -  so the integrated handholds (on the new Silverado/Sierra) are not obstructed.  The latch to roll up the cover is accessed by opening the tailgate, and the cover rolls up nice and compact.  It doesn't obstruct the rear window or take up any bed space to a noticeable degree.  There are latches (connected so you only need to operate one) on both driver and passenger side for swinging open the folding section behind the cab.<br /><br />The cover itself is a glossy viny, and is held on by strips of Velcro.  It only has been on a short time, so we'll see how it holds up.  The components seem pretty decent, though.  The only issue I had was the one striker plate for the folding section was attached upside down.  But that was no big deal - just had to remove 2 nuts to fix it.
B000GASX9O|5|I was a little surprised that it cam with no documentation at all. However, it really didn't require any. I screwed it to the wall and connected it to my batteries. It charges them quickly and doesn't overcharge. It is a great upgrade from the standard car battery charger I was using.
B003YJ47JO|4|I used this product on a 1996 Mitsubishi 3000gt non-turbo automatic with 92k miles on it. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1. The truth is that you might have a hard time accessing the throttle body, like I did.  Mine is located towards the back of the engine bay, which meant that I spent most of my time with my back bent.  I kept worrying about the positioning of the fluid injection line, but after positioning it and repositioning it, I just decided to go with my guts.  It took me about 15 minutes to empty the can at 1,500 rpm.  Make sure you park your car so that the inlet of the throttle is facing downhill so that your engine doesn't get flooded.<br /><br />2. The spray cleaner was useful, but with the location of my throttle body, it was really hard to get it where I wanted it to go.  I used a cloth to wipe the inside, but again, everything was hard to access.  My fingers were bending in ways that it wasn't meant to.<br /><br />3. The fuel additive was pretty simple.<br /><br />With the first ignition, my car didn't start.  After a second attempt, it started up just fine.  I let the car idle for 5 minutes before driving off for 15 minutes.  My first reaction was that the engine was more responsive and the engine was in sync with my gas input.  In terms of performance differences, I felt some additional low-end power, but that died out when I hit 3000 rpm (this might be my car's fault).  To my amazement, my car seems to be driving quieter. I didn't get any black exhaust like the video had explained.<br /><br />My next step is to get an oil change and fill up with a fresh tank of gas to get some real performance and MPG figures.  I also want to drive it at highway speeds to see if there are any differences there. I will update my review soon.<br /><br />Update: my car feels so much smoother and power delivery is more direct.  I haven't seen any real-world fuel efficiency improvements (maybe because I've been driving it more aggressively!)
B000CIY0U6|2|Two small for my tail gate, had to re order from another supplier and pay two times.. as said before might ne able to resale to some one else.. Thanks EdTwell
B00BFDHPE0|5|Fit on my 02 RSX.
B00AEH4S7A|5|Perfect.  No issues at all.
B000WJBJUO|5|What can I say love chrome and when it looks good it make me feel good fast honest merchant nice peace ! JUST GOOD TUFF STUFF !!!
B006922682|5|I Recieved my parts very quickly and they were exactly as described, they fit perfectly, look great on my bike.
B00FBKUAFY|4|Arrived a day ahead of delivery date. Plug and play. Works like it should.
B001CF3J6E|1|Disregarding the negative reports, I invested in two of these devices. One for each of the jeeps.<br /><br />The compasses in each (1) don't agree with each other and (2) don't agree with a REAL military-grade lensatic compass.<br /><br />Can't speak to the inclinometer aspect as yet. But the compass issue is REALLY BAD!
B0009IQZH0|1|It comes up when you search chamois.  I thought it is some sort of chamois, but it is cloths instead.
B000B66NMC|5|This is a great tool if you need to carry only one tool of a certain size without having a ratcheting set for a special job like a tow hitch bolt.
B000HACYNY|5|Works great and I can FINALLY clean the top of my car (my short lady-arms could reach before)!
B000X23T8A|5|Perfect fit! Thank you for the fast delivery.
B00DTX4YY8|5|Great
B00I504N64|5|Had my local auto repair shop put one on for my Cadillac. Great fix.
B009JVTKWU|5|Best pressure plate for the money for sure! I bought a pressure plate for my K series civic and this pressure plate bites harder than the one I had in there before! Thanks!!
B00KMRCPJA|5|It does exactly what is says.  Perfect for hard wiring a GPS where you can't chop of the plug. I used it under the dash hard wired into the fuse box, and then plugged the GPS into it, a few cable ties and install was done and hidden from view.  No more dangling cables.
B0049GBB7W|3|These were great at first at removing wheel weights.  After doing 100 or so weights, the tips have worn and just don't work anymore.  I can't tell you how many times I've crushed my fingers with these things.
B0009IQYZ8|5|Works as expected.  Good value
B00BCQFBLE|3|I admit, I bought it because it was pink. its really cute but if your battery is completely dead, plan on getting the jumper cables out. but it does work if you have a little charge left on your battery. so if you have a good battery & just left interior light on overnight, this works great but if your battery has gone bad & you let it get completely drained, may wanna look at a more functional not so cute jump box
B000CB3WWK|4|It is a universal windshield washer pump and it works with my 2005 Hyundai Accent, but a bit of adjustment with the wires was necessary (I think universal means it is good for almost everything but perfect for nothing).
B001RJN56Y|5|Works well
B00F7P48JM|5|Thanks
B0002UQAXY|5|I will say it again and again, this company is quality. I have bought a handful of different things from them and you get your monies worth. I was afraid these were one time use. I was afraid I should not wash and use on different colored car... I was afraid for nothing they held up wash after wash and car after car. 3 so far and still in great shape. I wash them by hand only but I have seen reviews of people saying toss them in washing machine. I honestly thing they would hold up but I am just as happy to take care of my garage stuff in my garage sink and let them dry out in the sun when I am done and put them right back in their supplied bags.<br /><br />Great job Meguiars in keeping the quality to what we would expect. I will continue to recommend your products to my friends!
B00FBQOTI2|5|nice, thank you
B0002NILQU|5|Dressed up the old worn steering wheel.  Nice looking cover.
B008MO3HNI|5|My husband loves this helmet. Stylish and affordable! Breathes good
B00335JQN6|5|The best on the market. PERFECT FIT. Love Em'
B00AJ701IU|5|I was pleased with the results of the product the kit was<br />A good value got to clean an polish a lot of things :-)
B00O6MO3VU|5|As advertised
B002623WBE|5|Worth every penny , even for the weekend<br />car person. built to last.<br />I had a Porter Cable and it failed after<br />3 years.
B0012TUT2M|3|These gloves are definitely waterproof. They're basically just very thick rubber gloves. I wear a large glove and bought the extra-large overglove. With my thin summer bike gloves, these just barely fit over them, and won't fit over my winter gloves at all. My hand started to go numb after about fifteen minutes riding with them. I had to pull over, take them off, and just deal with wet hands.<br /><br />I bought the XL size because I wanted them to be able to fit over both my summer and winter gloves. Generally, over-clothing is ordered in the same size as the garment it is to be worn over. However, with this product, even one size over isn't big enough.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the product would have worked great if it fit properly. If fit was correct, it would have gotten five stars.
B0012FKICC|4|I'm not a big iron-er, I usually just throw it in the drier for a few minutes. But I've been learning to sew and ironing is kind of a must there. I bought this so I wouldn't have a giant ironing board around. While it works well for my little quilting squares, I feel like the fold in the middle would be difficult to iron something larger like a shirt. So if you need an ironing board for things like shirts and pants, I don't think this is a good purchase for you. But if all you're doing are squares and handkerchiefs, this is just fine :)
B008AF7640|5|excellent and bright! i bought 3 pair! I didnt like the switch so i hooked them up to each side marker lamp so each went on when you turn the parking lights on! This way the 2 lights are the same brightness when you ues the switch set up one side is brighter than the other ! But thats typical
B00PHUD41U|5|Awesome sticker! Looks great on my vehicle!
B0047RV8WG|5|I'd for sure pay a couple bucks more for cheap plastic pliers or some kinda single use tool to take out the old bulbs- they're really hard to take out!<br />But anyways, these work great, no more dead batteries from leaving incandescent ones on.
B00684TAYY|5|This looks, feels, smells, tastes, and performs exactly as the original did. If you are looking to replace a damaged, or lost in my case, Nissan FOB this is the one. In fact, it's possible this IS an original from the same supplier Nissan would get them because even the writing on the back is the same.
B005H5Z4NQ|5|As advertised. Sizing was perfect, my 22 1/2&#34; head fits perfect in a medium. Well made, solid construction. Bluetooth synced up instantly to my iPhone 5 and works great. Not a bulky helmet either.<br /><br />The sound quality could be better, but it's sufficient - gets a little hard to hear at high speeds.<br /><br />Overall, an amazing helmet.
B001EAQTRI|5|This product was perfect in eliminating the hissing noise in my system.
B00BSIZCME|5|Its a bumper/ glass sticker.  It stays were you put it unless you are trying to stick it on a grainy plastic dash cover but its not make for that.
B003RVUN0G|5|well because is working very good and I was helped to program it very good,thanks and very happy that I can close and open my car by the remote!!!
B0013V6M7U|5|Great gift for my grandpa!
B0007ZG9TO|5|filling small holes in old boat.
B00JOY6U7U|5|This is definitely a 'better quality' Clamp--&#62; 12V Power Plug than many others that are offered.  The material is good compared with just about everything else out there.  The clamps are the '2 sided teeth' type instead of the cheap 1 sided type.  The cable and plug itself is sufficient gauge.  Had no problem operating my air compressor or inverted.  This will probably last years.
B00498FKWC|5|AWESOME
B006UH508Y|5|These little things are not easy to find!  I lost one recently and they came standard on my double axle bass boat trailer.  I cant really understand HOW they got to my home as fast as they did?  EXACTLY what I needed - laser beam shipping and processing - literally 1 business day between when I ordered and when I received?  Great price and perfect match to original.  Could NOT be happier!!!
B0080DIP38|5|This is 20 cm X 22 CM fits perfectly in Hyundai's with the frame for the filter, see photo.
B004W4F3SE|4|Not a Jeep Grand Cherokee speaker. Factory JGC speakers are infinity gold series speakers. But it is a stock mopar speaker that sounds really good. Dont know if it will last with the factory infinity amp. Would if given 5 stars but the title was a bit misleading.
B0013V6M7U|5|The license plate holder is awesome! We live in a\\"golfing\\" community, so this item has turned out to be quit the topic of conversation around our area!<br />Speedy service & shipping from the vendor also.<br />Thank You
B004D92S9K|5|Great heavyweight sticker stock and nice tongue in cheek approach to fandom.Clear,bold printing and easy to apply to ground or sky vehicles or gear.
B0050Z9WL8|4|Fast shipping and product works great. Bracket for ballast is a little flimsy but no big deal. Had to switch a few wires around but was able to install the lights in under an hour .
B000JFL8RK|5|The spin on filter/drier is manufactured by Robinair. The filter on my A/C evac/recharge machine needs changed approx. once per year. This is an OEM filter and has worked out very well.
B004DR6ZJG|5|Este dispositivo es necesario en cualquier moto y el precio es inmejorable ademas de la calidad del dispositivo. Yo la uso desde el 2011 en la Suzuki Vstrom DL 650 asignada en la Brigada Motorizada del Cuerpo de Bomberos del Distrito Capital en Venezuela y ha funcionado muy bien. Un compañero recibió el impacto de un camión y protegió la moto. Apenas raspó el Suzuki SV 650 1000 S DL No Cut Black Frame Sliders
B004I16WK4|5|I had a huge hole in my passenger side tailight housing. I bought this particular replacement assembly and it worked out great! I sold my car a few months later down the road and was I glad I repaired this on my own, I'm sure it helped a bit with the re-sell value of my Hyundai Sante Fe!
B008M4R4BY|5|Is working well
B0089GTC92|5|Work great, only problem i have is people moving over thinking i'm a cop or something. Then again i drive a blacked out Tahoe with white day time driving lights lol
B00G4CQEBC|4|Best price &works great.
B008E7QLC2|5|Works perfectly well. Never knew that such a cheap set of brake pads would perform so well. They stop on a dime and don't make any noticeable noise.<br /><br />I quickly changed out the old pads in less than 30 minutes. If you have 20-60 minutes, a jack and a tire iron. Don't pay someone to change your brakes, just do it yourself. It would actually take you longer (drive time, wait time, repair time) and cost you more if you went it got it done somewhere.<br /><br />You will also feel a lot more accomplished that you've done something on your vehicle yourself.
B000TYSMIY|5|Works, and definitely won't fall off
B002TISA6W|5|The starter in my 1999 camry died. Checking all the prices, this was the cheapest price for a new starter (a used one with about 100,000 miles on it costs about $45). I had my doubts since it was so cheap, but I decided to take the chance. I got it in a week, took 1 and 1/2 hours to install and now my car runs fine. Saved me over $300.
B000182EV4|5|Fit perfect, easy to install. Super fast delivery
B004OK5SZE|4|This replaced a jack of lighter duty and fits and works perfectly but was slightly taller than i expected so my tail gate hits it if i am not careful when i drop the tail gate
B001EOWQAS|5|Easy to install and works great.
B00CWKMAZO|5|Fit well and looks good
B000YC9FTQ|1|Don't works
B00B6X7PGM|5|just what i wanted,good price,fast shipping
B000FW4LT4|5|I found one of these many yrs ago and was afraid it would scratch the windshield. HOWEVER by far the best scrapper anyone could have. It is efficient and will not *or has not broken like all the plastic ones that are out there. I have had my original one for about 15 yrs.............but just in case........when I found these.......bought 2 more. You won't be disappointed.
B00A3UNYW8|5|Sure beats trying to make the procedure in the manual work!
B009082VDC|5|outstanding thank you
B000EDSSMA|1|did not fit my stove at all, which is a regular standard kitchen stove. i already threw away the box, so had to keep it. but it was a terrible buy. and super expensive.
B00HESPW4K|4|Worked great did not stick as well as I would have liked but a little gorilla glue took care of it. Good product and looks great
B001KO2Q7U|1|The description said it would fit my husband's motorcycle - not even close! Fell apart while the motorcycle mechanic was trying to put it on. Complete waste of money!
B000K1CFXO|2|SOMEONE has to make a crimper that gets me above a 50% success rate. I've been crimping wires all of my adult life and I end up using needle nose pliers most of the time.
B00BYNJ7OW|5|Worked great as a replacement for junk Rancho 9000's. Make sure you have yourself prepared to push the guys up when they are released, took all my strength to get them in place. The straps that held them together were not the right length for my truck, had to cut them loose and struggle to get them in place, due to the great gas dampening of these shocks, my Rancho's were soft and squishy in comparison. I thought with the larger bore diameter of the Rancho's they would work better, well 18k or so in and 3 of the 5 had either blown or developed dead spots. This on regular driving and light off road use.  They seem to really help the ride of my 2002 Ford F250 4x4 Crew Cab, I don't expect a sports car ride, just trying to make it less like a floating boat on the road. These shocks are well worth the money from Amazon, saved bundles over buying them at the parts store.
B008EEIER0|3|Product is easy to tell as a knock off. Blue painted area was not uniformly glossy, and some of the blue painted area was actually dull. Not quite what I expected. the item was inexpensive, and I probably expected too much for the money. I was glad that I did not order three, but only one. It went on the tailgate of the truck.
B0009V1WS4|5|Strong, versatile and it locks.  The ideal companion to the HI-Low Hitch and the standard hitch on the vehicle.  Would definitely recommend it.
B003YMPM90|5|I debated on going with a more expensive K&N or a higher priced dry filter.  The Pentius filter more than fits my needs (no drag racing in this Kia Soul).  However, the basic performance did improve and milage increased 1 or 2 per gallon.  Great filter for the price.
B00802GIW4|5|great product for price will purchase again for other vehicle.
B005JK5HQI|4|Bought the L/XL. Tightest it will go is 71/4, 22 3/4\\", size I wanted, and goes to melon. It will get looser with time so might have been better off with S/M.<br />Looks to be easy to add padding to snug it up.
B001RK54EY|5|Installed the mild2wild in my 2012 corvette and love it great product 5 minute install, comes with great directions, works great, I would recommend this to everyone, just another cherry on top , worth every penny
B001QT9KO6|2|We where very disappointed in how it worked compared to what it claims. It was a tiny bottle that did nothing in stopping the leak. Waste of money.
B00D01N850|3|This visor is HUGE, so pay attention to the dimensions. Installation was easy but no instructions are provided. So if you're unsure where to mount it just search online. Fitment was ok. The edges are not cut cleanly. Sturdy build quality and the 3m double sided tape is solid. Stays mounted even after rain and freeway driving. If you don't mind the aesthetics, it's a great visor. Visor came on time and in perfect condition.
B000OWXRAY|4|I think most of the lower star reviewers on this item are being a bit picky and biased about this product. No, it isn't expensive, doesn't have grips or anything special, BUT, it's a pretty damn good little screwdriver set.<br /><br />I originally ordered this to take apart my Nintendo DS Lite, but we had found a Tri-Wing screwdriver and didn't need this one. When I e-mailed the seller to cancel the order, I got a pretty fast reply, but the order had already shipped so I decided to just keep it once it arrived. When it did arrive, I tried it out and it works pretty decently and/or very good.<br /><br />The screwdriver itself is very sturdy (it does NOT look like it's going to \\"fall apart any second\\", at least to me, and if you plan on using this little screwdriver in outrageous ways that would risk breaking it's super hard plastic, then don't get this set). The bits themselves are decent as well, the Tri-Wing bit worked excellently. The case isn't flimsy, yeah, it is cheap, but it DOES snap closed gently and holds everything in (I can shake it and none of the bits will fall out of their places), just take care in not dropping it or letting it fall, because I'm pretty sure everything would go flying.<br /><br />Overall, if someone wants a quick multi-set of bits without spending too much, I would recommend this set. It does what it was made for, plain and simple.
B003MOA25O|1|I looked on a few other sites plus the actual Pulstar site to make sure this spark plug would work for my 2000 Mazda Protege.  Long story short, this made my car idle weird.  I tried all I could do to check for any faults, I took each plug out, cleaned the boot and plug free of any dust or rust that may have gotten in there, put it all back together, and no luck.  I'm sure these are great plugs, but definitly not made for my car. I will definitly be returning this item.  I'm only giving it one star since it was suppose to fit my car, however, it didn't.  I'm not sure of how it performs in other cars.
B0024E6QX0|5|Fast shipping perfect product glad I bought it it definitely helps with the light so we can sleep in
B00ARVNCR0|4|Just received a set of JBA 2035S-2JT shortie headers for my 2013 FJ Cruiser and found the egr tubes to not be located in the correct position for my vehicle. Headers have a flange welded to the tube at the back of each header (face of flange facing the fire wall). My FJ's EGR tube flanges come up near the middle cylinder with the face of the flange facing up towards the under side of the hood.
B006Z907TY|5|Purchased this as I had sprained my ankle badly while on holiday in Mexico. As my husband was joining me the next week, I ordered it online and he brought it with.I decided to buy my own extender so that I could lie down in the plane without being disturbed by the flight staff and it fitted on various airlines which I flew with Internationally on this holiday. It is universal as indicated~ I was a bit worried that it wouldn't be but it was.We flew Aeromexico, then KLM and Emirates. I will take this with me on all future holidays just for comfort when I can get the odd chance of lying down again.Loved the pouch with a little note that says it was purchased privately so that you don't get stopped if they think is theirs. Fits into handbag very easily.
B002IPODA8|5|perfect fit at a good price
B001RLZ7P4|5|Way better pricing than anywhere local. Great wire set.
B00BULZX7S|2|No instructions on how to install this product.  Only a single sheet of paper showing a diagram of installation.  I had to search online for the full installation instructions.  What it failed to tell you is that you need a rivet tool in order to install the hooks.  Honesty if I knew this was the case I would not have bought the product.
B0041I6FII|5|Great fit for my vette! Even seems better then than the original, which I still have but can no longer use.
B000V8VZ78|5|I purchased both the Lexol leather cleaner/conditioner and this product. I used them both on my old Ford truck's leather seats. The Lexol product is a fine cleaner and conditioner, but on my old seats the European Leather product left my seats much softer and more supple than the Lexol. A great product and excellent customer service.
B009XP18F4|5|Great product I am going to order one without the fleece for the summer time. Great company.
B005FXZSCW|4|Just what I needed, looks good and works good. I'm Happy with my perches.  Thanks
B004O8ZCS4|5|took longer to drop rusted spare tire crack than install part.  Comes with everything you need  much better than OEM.
B00C6MQURC|5|I bought this Sway Bar for my Chery Tiggo two weeks ago. They have a good quality. Still I have the oldest one because I need another spare part but It seem to me these will work properly as the original one.
B00067BVKK|1|I've ordered these bulbs twice in the span of 18 months, with them lasting an average of 9 months each with low beams burning out. Completely unacceptable for the price point, I'll be shopping for another brand.
B00AN8NF6A|5|Perfect fit and function
B009AA4NYK|5|Fit perfect and was good quality.
B00IWGKSK6|5|Perfect! LOVE the lining! Exactly what I wanted, GREAT price, SUPER fast shipping! Will order again!
B000FW61SI|1|okay not what I expected
B000GZNTQ6|5|A good product.  Shipped quickly, and fairly priced.  They always arrive in good condition, too.
B005LH0728|4|Hi,<br /><br />I am interested in putting this on my mazda 3. However before I decide, how do I remove the badge in the future if I decided to ? ( I saw your comment saying that it is safe to remove but how do I remove it?)<br /><br />Thanks.
B000CQPLSS|1|my car did not have rear disk -- per amazon these fit my car ---NOT!!!!so now I am stuck with them --the cost is too high to return them
B0098OGVMA|4|Fit perfectly and easy to install.  Have not used yet.
B007OW62V8|5|Sure beats paying dealer price for original filter which is easily installed.  I always prefer reasonable priced original items to self install.
B00C1CS27I|5|This product is excellent quality, maybe even better than the original. It does the job and I have no complaints so far. Changing this is a whole other story though! Good luck to those repairing it. Have a beer near by!
B00B8X29UW|5|Excellent deal and transaction!
B001NKZKBA|4|This ATV bag held a ton of stuff and kept it all dry and safe through rain and mud puddles.  The zipper covers and rain fly are a great addition!  Easy to install and remove.
B003I4CY9A|1|Does this harness for the uv10 model?
B0042OKAY6|1|I would not recommend this product. The customer service that I received was awesome say the least. I went through two of these lights, neither one fit the truck. the second one was exactly like the first. Probably a defect on the manufacturing line or something. The mold for the light was messed up or something.  There was a giant gap between all sides of the light that was to mate securely with the cab of the truck. the light looks good, but its functionality is junk.  I would not recommend purchasing this light.
B000FQ0842|5|Perfect replacement
B00062ZFLQ|4|This air filter provided a slight improvement to fuel economy over the old air filter which was fairly new. There was a slight increase in power but not very much.
B00IEKNIL6|5|Seems like a good set of rotors.  As advertised.  Good quality.  I bought these for a 98 toyota corolla because I was doing a brake job on all brakes and the last time I had the rotors turned (2006) they said after that they would not be able to be machined/turned again because they would be below the minimum thickness.  So I figured since I was doing it myself buy these and it was only a few dollars more than purchasing plain factory replacements.
B009XINN9K|5|fast shipping very pleased !!!!!
B00032K4VA|5|Works great with any thing im telling you lol great item I recommend to any one promise you its with the money. ..
B005IRXTEO|5|Provides a slightly stiff ride at first but less rolling through turns has been nice..only 500 miles on them so far...don't forget to purchase new shock boots as well and check your shock mounts.
B000C2SBTI|2|Gates lists this as the proper hose for a 94-01 Integra GSR.  It technically fits, but the staight section that mounts to the thermostat housing is about an inch shorter than the OEM hose.  This causes the hose to be slightly angled compared to the OEM hose and it contacts the mount for the OEM airbox.<br />The hose seems to be well constructed, but the design needs to be modified for this vehicle.
B004AKXQFM|5|Great
B00594OIWS|5|Valve stem caps come in a variety of materials and prices.  Many of them are cheap plastic, but these are solid and add a great finishing touch to the wheels.  With tire pressure monitoring systems built in to new vehicles, taking care to protect the valve stems is much more important.  A little extra protection can reduce the risk to a much more expensive repair if you have to replace the tire pressure monitor in the wheel.
B001UFRHKK|5|Perfect gift for my brother, who is a mechanic. Packaged well. Product as described.
B00CUNALVI|5|Its installed but have not used bought it for future use radio has instructions for this next phone to be an I phone
B0028JLO3I|5|Helps significantly!  As described!  I have plates in my neck and can not fully turn my head when driving.  This mirror is a great help.
B009X1T72O|5|fit perfect
B001RZ68F8|5|VERY GOOD
B000CP2YO8|3|Floormats are slick on the back so they slide around.  There should be little cleats or something to keep the mats in place.
B00AAGG99U|3|These signs are visible, and a nice size.  It is good that they come in a pack of 3.  We put one on each of the front doors, and one on the rear.  The problem was that they quickly lost ability to stick.  The corners stopped adhering to the car.  One at a time, these fell off while driving.  Need a stronger magnet.
B00E9GVTZG|5|Cover fits great. Easy to get back into the original sack, too (that was surprising). Seems to work great. Will use when trailer is stored outside.
B0027FE9MQ|3|All this is is a 3m sticky rubber backed crome body strip about 1/3 inch wide and about that high cut to fit.  I grant the rep's thinking of \\"If you just go past someone on the road it would look decent.\\" but anyone who ever got within 10 feet would say \\"Congrats you put body trim on the edge of your grill.\\"  It's not even on the literal front edge it sets on the top of the grill.  This will likely end up on or in your radiator with any force, note driving 55-75MPH and attached to the front of the car.  I guess that maybe good except the $5 I already spent to get it and the price to send it back.  The photo's are worthless don't believe what you see.   Just hit up a good body man and buy some small crome body stripping and cut it to fit yourself if this is what you want, it's cheaper and why not save yourself some money and annoyance.  If you're really inteligent get some adhesive backed crome stripping the actual depth of your grill and thin so it actually looks like it should.      Note I amended my original.
B0054RABJE|5|A simple, dark visor. Dark enough that you can't see into it from outside, giving the rider a somewhat forbidding look.<br /><br />One of the other reviews says it's ok after dark, I disagree. Obviously you can still see through it in the dark, and I got home safely enough, but in future I'll change it for a clear one when I know I'll be out after dark.<br /><br />However here in AZ it's indispensable in bright sunlight. On normally sunny days I don't need sunglasses, and on the really bright days it works great with sunglasses or my helmet's built in sun visor to cut down the light to a bearable level.
B002M4M3FC|3|This is a molded carpet for an old Jeep Wagoneer station wagon. I did not expect it to fit perfectly - after all, jeeps (and Land Rovers) were never created equal. However...<br />- Rear passenger area carpet: fit around the pedestal of the rear seat is very poor. No amount of shuffling it around, stretching, or tucking it in the corners would make it fit well.<br />- Front passenger area carpet: the fit, actually, is somewhat better than the rear. However, the molded area that covers the transmission tunnel is at least an inch wider than it should be, so it will never fit snug. Despite me keeping the factory heat/soundproofing in place.<br />- Instructions: by God, disregard them. The most-glaring-bad instruction is to place the old carpet on top of the new, and mark and cut the holes so they line up. There are two holes in the front area carpet: for the high beams floor switch, and for the transfer case lever. Since the three-dimensional shape of the new carpet doesn't match the factory one, the holes will never line up. It was passable for the little hole for the dimmer switch - but the large hole for the transfer case stick ended up being a complete disaster. The only way to &#34;fix&#34; fix that for me is to order ... another front area carpet from the same source.<br /><br />On a great positive side - the color is perfect. It matches the interior much better than the (very faded and dirty) factory carpet.
B00B6JZ0OK|2|Had this item for a few months and the top coat winkled up, I'm guessing due to the weather.  I even removed it to go thru the car wash. Gave it a 2 star because I love the design. I did return and received another. We'll see how this one holds up.
B004AIG6W4|1|Did not my 2004 Chrysler Pacifica front door.
B00JYBY8G8|1|Not real happy , don't like the sound tried contacting them for some help and never got it.
B006MX81FA|5|Awsome fit
B007HRHQAG|5|I have a Hurricane enclosed trailer and it fit very well. very easy to install. took like 5 min or less. would recommend to anyone.
B0028NB1SM|5|Best &#34;over glasses&#34; safety glases I've used
B0002SPBYK|2|I think this is a great idea, but doesn't quite work as well as I'd liked.  The applicator is smaller than I'd like, but that part doesn't bother me that much.  The problem is the foam part of the applicator -- in my opinion it's too soft.  When applying the dressing to the tire, the foam is pushed down to-- or below -  the metal handle which prevents it from being very effective. When the foam is pushed into the handle, the applicator isn't making contact with the tire.  Maybe I'm heavy-handed, but for me, this doesn't work.
B001P1WXV2|5|still on the car. very nice little upgrade on anycar
B000H6QWWC|5|Good, solid, well stitched and the mechanicals are well built. I've had many &#34;name-brand&#34; straps that were falling apart right out of the box - these are confidence inspiring. Recommend!
B00BCI6PJ4|2|Pretty poorly made, but at this price they're just a toy really. I wouldn't rely on these to be a functional pair of goggles.
B009DJSP4C|5|Work great, awesome price.
B000IY7X9O|5|Installed on my 08 300C SRT8.  These cars are notorious for brake squeal because the factory pads eat the heck out of the rotors.  Installed these with Raybestos Advanced Technology rotors and some CRC brake paste and the squeal is gone!  Even after a decent bedding run, the dust was pretty minimal, much less than factory pads.  Being that I live in a rainy climate I went with semi-metallic over ceramic as I've read that ceramic doesn't bite as good when they're wet.  Great deal for the $, especially on a lightly driven car.
B00F3DW0KM|5|As listed
B002XL2IG8|4|Just as I ordered but not what I wanted. Nice to have an extension core but the plug-in is different then the receptacle on our Fifth Wheel. We can still use it.
B005DQ5C2C|3|These are high quality spacers but they don't have the rounded lug nuts to perfectly center the wheel. It's not that important, it just made putting them on slightly more difficult. I put these on a sportsman 500 and they have held up great.
B00CSCQNFO|5|The stickers are a lot of fun, and my son just loves them!
B006R34PB4|5|Great Deal, Very Bright low amp draw.  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
B00H7M8GNW|5|Super awesome product.  Corrects the funky HD o-ring problem.  No leaks!
B000HTYLSG|5|the best fog lighting
B0013AV9B0|4|Works good.
B001XX1PSO|5|the best brakes money can buy,it is like night and day diff. in how well they work and the stopping power is 2x better than stock !
B005JZTL92|4|It  did the job.  I was unable to fasten my seat belt but now I can.  It was the perfect fit.  Thank you.
B008I3IYGS|4|After over 2 months of researching which transmission oil my girlfriends  2010 2.5 Mazda 3 5AT requires.  I finally bought this redline fluid.  Works like a charm.  Very well under heat.  Smooth shifts.  The mazdas have very picky transmissions and this was the only compatible synthetic fluid I could find besides OEM.  It's been about 8,000 miles so far and I'm happy with it.
B0059DE7E8|5|I really like the small simple design of this lock. Easy to use and does the job.
B002YDM50O|5|Although the block heaters are a factory installed feature on Cummins diesels, the plug in cord is a Dealer Option on Dodge Rams newer than 2003.  Why wouldn't a diesel have a block heater as standard equipment?  Dealer was asking over $85 of a 6 foot extension cord that has the fitting to fit the Cummins block heater, more to have it installed.  Really? $85 for about $2 worth of wire?<br /><br />Fleetguard has them for around $15, less than $25 when you figure in shipping, and it's about a 5 minute install just about anyone can do.  I'll be checking here for parts from now on before wasting money at the dealership.
B000ET5264|5|Works fine, no stem leaks, simple operation. If it acts up, leave it alone for a few minutes and try again: presto!
B000KE29QO|5|They were delivered in timely matter, and are of great quality. It took me and my son about 30 mins to put them on, easy easy.
B004I0H86C|5|Great  product!
B000BZG65W|5|Price was outstanding, Service was as within 7-14 days as requested, Part was as order, will use Amazon for the next order. Very pleased with outcome. Cannot ask for anything better, you will have me returning soon for more parts. Thank you Amazon.[[ASIN:B000BZG65W Bosch 13242 Oxygen Sensor, OE Type Fitment],[[ASIN:B000C9RY5I ACDelco 4K353 Fan Belt]]
B008RAPM7G|5|Very happy with my purchase
B009FNQRMI|5|Hey came at/near delivery date, which is odd because most orders arrive early but they fit perfectly & look great! Photo's to follow !
B0000D9PL1|2|Demoted 1 star because it is made in China.  That said, it has been reliable for 2,000 miles on my 1979 Fiat Spider.    Edit: lasted only 6,000 miles before leaking oil and failing.
B005GX3GFW|5|This makes mowing so easy. Also use this on the tractor while finish mowing and other jobs. Saves your arms!
B00FSU1SLW|4|Like the vest , but have to send back . if your a very big guy , 7XL will still not work for you . even with it being 7XL it was still to small . it wasn't the seller fault I am sure they knew nothing about it , but i would buy from the again
B000C83TUS|4|A little pricey but it worked out for me. I would buy again if I needed another one. That is all
B00KJ17SOG|5|Great light super bright
B0097W8FAO|5|This Standard Motor Products switch was an identical replacement of the OEM item it replaced. It was less expensive and was made in the USA, which to me is always a plus.
B00OW0UAJA|5|Very well made-simple,functional & looks good.
B003ANJD6Q|5|I recently purchased this product. The product is as described and fits my volvo xc60 2013, although the material is a little bit firmer than expected.
B005JU5XE4|5|I figured why write a review just repeating the same experence most others had. But then again. Why not? I  am 58 years old and my eyes aren't what they used to be.  I've tried many other manufacturers blades and have always been disappointed.  Driving at night in the rain had  become , to be honest, a frightening experence. I was familiar enough with quality of Bosch products not to worry too much about the high price. Simple click in installation (on Acura TL) turned them on and was amazed.  In one soundless pass, a beautifully clear streakless windshield. I  wanted to call people and tell them how happy I was with my new blades Lol.. I've only had them a cpl weeks so I  cannot vouch for longevity . But think about it given what we pay for gas these days even  if they only last 8 months or so,  my safety (and others)  is absolutely worth the equivalent of a tank of gas.<br />BTW according to plenty of reviews they last longer than that
B008OOPBOY|5|The shipment was very fast. Size 15 motorcycle boots are hard to find unless the are Harley style boots, which I did not want. The boots are very well made and sharp looking. The initial fit seemed a little tight at first (15 R), but after a couple of rides on the bike, the fit great. Buy these boots!
B005CLP92G|5|Great Product. Fast shipment.
B007OSL3DY|5|worked very well.  nothing cheap about this product other than the price.
B00029WYEY|5|Works great, fair price. I used it recently and it works as described.
B003TQGT4S|5|Good stuff, way better than some crap I got at a local store. It's expensive, but you only need to use it where you are welding and on overlapping places.  Not for painting inside stuff, there are better products for that.
B005VSIHHE|5|nice metallic sticker, i put it on the bottom of my longboard and get compliments 24/7. Its on my Loaded Ceviche
B0046DPSKO|1|Ad said it was brown, true color is orange and the stones were falling out as soon as it arrived. I have not used it and should be sending it back soon.
B00JCE5XN4|5|Good plate frame for the low price.
B00KYHLDUA|5|great product do not know how I got by without it
B000HKXXW0|5|Great sound on my 4.0L engine after the cat.  Not too loud but the low tone is noticeable, great low end rumble and not too much highway drone.
B0002NIKVG|5|I have this key chain on my work jacket and it's a great ice breaker at work.  Pleople that don't normally talk say cool Superman zipper and the next thing you know they are chatting away.
B00M5FMA9W|5|very good !
B0051DUVK0|5|product works as specified, it detected that my o2 sensor (down flow) was not functioning after the car got warmed up, replaced o2 sensor and cleared the faulty code and all is well.
B007ETLID8|5|Excellent product
B00VHE6LAQ|5|I was a little skeptical of purchasing a light that I couldn't find any reviews on other than on amazon but ordered it anyway. I must say the light is built very nice..This light bar is amazing!!!...this light performs above and beyond my expectations. I am pretty sure that this is the same light that other manufacturers are selling for twice the cost. everything is exactly the same on them. So far I couldn't be any happier with it.If you had any doubts before just buy it and you'll see!Will be buy one more for my jeep!!Recommend!!!
B004YRES30|5|I love this band had to let the world know about it! I put it on my car and it applied really easily too.
B000E89B5S|5|I goy this light to attach to my baby's car seat canopy to have some light when it is night without having to turn on the car's ceiling lights because that sometimes distracts my husband while he drives . This is a strong light but I like that you can rotate and point it wherever you want . I put it pointing away of baby's face so he doesn't wake up but it still gives me enough light to see him
B0015AOI9S|5|This unit works as advertised.  I purchased it to connect and control an ipod player from the factory head unit.    Installation is straight forward and only took an hour and a half.  There are two input cords included in the package.  One cord connects directly to the ipod.  The other cord splits to a set of rca inputs and a standard 3.5mm headphone plug.    The head unit detected upac device right away and there were no problems controlling the ipod.      I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B0091XUAY8|5|For the money this is a great beacon. Don't expect to light up the streets at noon, but it does its job at night just fine.
B000B6JJUK|1|I bought 3 of these for Xmas gifts. The problem is that they do not power on at cold temperatures. I left all 3 in my car overnight in late December and all 3 failed to power on until they were brought inside and allowed to warm up. This is a huge problem here in Michigan where it sometimes stays below freezing for 2-3 months a year. As far as I'm concerned, they are almost useless as I don't think I should have to keep them in a heated environment. This negates the convenience of having a digital gauge.
B007LIBPZS|5|Looks great on my 90 Buick Rivera
B006DA2EPA|5|This is a great item! I purchased this about 4 months ago for my 13 ford explorer sport. It makes the turbos whistle and adds a noticeable 15 hp like advertised. Overall a great product for the price!
B00EA2VLE8|4|Very nice license plate frame. It is pretty good quality plastic. I can see over time of weather beating on it, the color will fade but it was at a great price so I wouldn't mind buying another. It is very stylish and I put it on my '15 Nissan Altima (Storm Blue color) and it looks awesome. My fiance' doesn't care for it much but that's okay. I bought the blue so he will get over it. Overall, a great license plate frame. It doesn't come with any hardware and I wish it did but couldn't beat the price.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B00952VG6Q|5|Worked on our 2005 Tundra with no problems.  We had the body shop install it.
B004SZFCPG|5|This has to be one of the best mics on the market. The sound is classic and seems to hold up better than a road king.
B00HRY1RXQ|5|Great fit on a 1999 Lexus LS400 and at $108 I paid for all 4 - this is a great value. They improved the handling and comfort - my family will continue riding a safer Lexus for years to come.
B003V57NUQ|4|Roof rack works fine and straps hold down kayak nicely.<br />The directions for assembly leave a lot to be desired.
B001H1B4CO|1|I installed this in my Vue and in less than a month the bearings failed. The bearings race is ring made of plastic and I was suspicious during the install of their capability. It didn't take long for them to let me know they weren't up for the job.
B001AJMOLS|4|I only use the driver side mirror. It really helps, and is a great alternative to spending so much more on aftermarket towing mirrors. Allows me to see down the lane beside my 30ft travel trailer.
B0023WH2Q8|5|I was looking to give my '96 Silverado a little bit of a style change when I came accross these.  This Company lives up to their reputation, and their standards are excellent! I highly recommend their products and their tremendous values!
B00NDN4ZE8|4|First impression, I was disappointed with quality, looked like the cheap Wal-Mart ones.  I washed before using, and they seem to be doing a good job.  I DID use dryer, but set on air dry only (no heat).  Work much better than I expected.  Not as good as Adams, but apparently Adams no longer available, as least haven't found them on their website.
B000KL361Y|5|Works great easy installation it doesn't come with directions so if u can't figure out how to put colors together go with the more expensive Walmart model
B00AKWTGSK|3|They're cool but they actually do not fit my vehicles peddles like it said it did before purchase
B00A32BI2Y|5|Very happy with these! Great seller communication also. Mr. Game & Watch decals aren't so common, but this is a great one. Good size, comes with two, and they look awesome.
B001G5W128|5|I have had this thermostat on my 2000 BMW E39 since December 2014 and have not had any problems with it. It was an easy install for me other than removing the fan shroud. After installing it I finally have a working heater on really cold days.
B00DPIFNME|5|Works great.  Installed it ourselves.  Not too hard if you read the directions.
B00BGZ2E1Q|4|makes the key fob a little bulky. Have had it for sometime has lasted teenage boy and wife.
B000AMBHG4|5|It was a half inch shorter than the original one but fit in place fine.  It tested well and was easily installed.
B0068EPM7I|5|Excellent
B0001L0DFA|5|Bought our first two Bon-Aire hose nozzel at a car show! That was 4 years ago and now have one on all 4 hoses at our home and one that we keep in our Motorhome, also! Have given them to my mom and kids because they are without a doubt the best hose nozzle you can buy. Don't waste your money on all of those cheap terrible nozzles at the retail stores. Of course, as is always the case you can't bear AMAZON for anything you may need from A to Z!
B003XGYDE2|5|very realiable.
B00F542DQU|5|Great product i had to buy 2 more
B00Z7N7KGW|5|Brush Hero did a great job on my Harley! I was able to get into those tight places between the motor's front cylinder and frame and get the bugs and road grime off. The rotating brush kept on spinning in those small spaces. No loss of power! Good Stuff!
B000E2CRIW|5|It's a pain having to pull plastics and the tank to get to the filter. Now I don't have to do it nearly as often!<br />As far as power/performance. It's hard to note without a dyno.
B006FDD74W|4|Key cannot be screwed out. It is glued and needs to be cut.
B000BOAX1G|5|I rely on these little mirrors.  They help to keep me safe.  The view is clear and and eliminate blind spots.
B0044AXQAI|5|Good !!!
B004WEO17S|4|I looked all over for these and thay all wanted 60.00 $ or more and then i found them here for 20.00 $ each saved a lot of cash
B001TPUCKI|3|The blower in my truck either buzzed like an angry little bee on low speeds or clunked on high. After 90,000 miles, I guess the bearings were giving out. This blower is an exact drop-in, or perhaps a push-up fit. It took me longer to go back to the toolbox to get a torx driver than it did to pull three screws, drop out the old, put in the new, and plug it in.  There was a snag with the maker - someone at Trumark put the wrong part number sticker on a box. But Amazon fixed that quickly, and now I can hear myself think in the truck without that bzzzzzzzzz.... drilling into my head.  A year later...it's failing intermittently. Seems to have a dead spot on the commutator or a bad centrifugal switch. Not sure what the internals are, but now and then, it won't start up without a good whack.
B009LN4MVK|5|Delivered on time, Taking the old one off was a bear! Realize you have to separate the exhaust to get the old one off and get this one on. Fit well ans worked perfectly.
B0055ORD6A|5|Yeah, OK, my 15 year old son decided that we were going to buy, a 2012 Ford Focus Titanium. And Dad was his accomplice; yes we bought every option possible on this car, except one. The stainless steel door sill plates were listed on the Ford site, but were not available at our dealer. After he spent a long time looking on that auction site, Dad found these in two seconds on Amazon.<br /><br />This is one of those funny little details that dresses up the Ford Focus. There is a little tiny bit of utility to these, it does protect the finish on the door sills, and will wear much better than paint. They really are not a necessity, but neither is the park aid or the satellite radio.<br /><br />Application couldn't be easier. There's one little step that might be cause for a moment of pause. This part includes everything required to do the install, instructions (the annoying graphical European no language style), swabs to clean the paint, and the sills with three rows of adhesive tape.<br /><br />The first step is the one that would normally cause a bit of concern, pull up the weather stripping along the bottom of the door opening. After installing one set of these, I could probably do this now without pulling up the weather stripping (there is just enough gap between the strip and the sill to position the sill plate). Fortunately the weather stripping pulls up easily, and it goes back down equally well. Next mark the center point of the door sill. It was 9 and 1/16 inch on my pair, and I marked the center point with a sharpie on the blue plastic protective film over the steel. Next wipe off the sill with the wet towel, and then dry the sill off (there are two pouches, one wet, the other dry - I made the mistake thinking they were both wet towels). Before pulling the adhesive strip covers, test fit the sill. There's a kind of funny looking marker on the instructions I could never find on my car. So I eyeballed the center mark to be between two spot welds. I also slid the sill cover back and forth a bit to make sure it sat on a perfectly flat part of the sill. Flip the sill plate over and pull off the film covering the three adhesive strips. The next step is to attach the plate to the sill. This was a little bit tricky on the first one (I did the passenger side first, so if I messed up I wouldn't have to look at that one every day). The plate has a round lip that needs to be tight against the sill of the car. Hold the lip down, with the other end up high, press the lip against the car body and then roll the plate down (attach the plate from the outside in basically). The plate will then sit flush against the car body. Once the adhesive touches the car, there's no good way to move the plate around. Press down firmly all over the plate. Peel the protective blue plastic. Then snap the weather stripping back in place. That's all there is to it.<br /><br />I like the look of this sill plate. It makes the car look more expensive. I can't say what it would look like with a white car, mine is the dark metallic gray with a black interior.<br /><br />Although the description here and many other places say, dealer installation recommended, this is not really very difficult to do. It's a nice little accessory.sill cover back and forth a bit to make sure it sat on a perfectly flat part of the sill.

B0016GRTVU|1|I'm not happy with this product at all. It broke the second time I used it!
B00CR3VVDS|5|i love it on my uncles lifted truck
B00BMEU9WW|5|great deal and worked perfect thanks!!!
B007H2PZ72|3|Heavy but well constructed. Good around the deck or camping
B00DRPGIJC|2|You get what you pay for..not the best quality. Don't think it'll last very long
B008CDZZXO|5|I built a 10 foot trailer and used this coupler for it, it's been 3 months of heavy use on the trailer and it still works like it was new. I've been very happy with it.
B0036FKNC6|5|didn't have any problems works well
B00336EN60|3|Decent jack for the money (I found it cheaper at PEP Boys, plus 25% off, plus a $20 mail-in cashback deal).<br /><br />Two minor issues so far;<br /><br />1. The manual is dreadful. For example, it tells you to check the hydraulic fluid level, but doesn't tell you where the filler cap is. It also tells you to bleed air out of the system, but doesn't tell you how.<br /><br />2. The rear - swivel - casters are useless. Only one moves, the other leaves black marks all over the garage floor. Will be replacing both very shortly.
B004RI4IG8|5|I just bought a Nissan Cube. and this is the best thing ever!!!  It fits perfect in the cube. I was worried when I read other reviews saying it was too small. But it is perfect for my car. I will deliberately park back wards just so I can show it off. and when you walk out to the car you can not help but to smile as it sits there and looks like it is smiling at you!!
B001B10XJ0|5|So far this is the best washing device I have tried.<br /><br />It holds a lot of soapy water, and the boars hair really scrubs at the tougher dirt. I can wash my full size truck in half the time it took me with smaller brushes or mitts.  Plus, and follow me here, I've noticed that I only use about half the water I normally do!  Pretty impressive how far you can wash without having to re-dip into the soap water.<br /><br />HEAVY reminder: If your vehicle is very muddy/dirty - DONT brush for a long time between rinse/re-soap dipping the brush - get that crap out of the brush, don't just smear it around - thats how you get swirl marks.<br /><br />The only improvement I would make to this brush is adding a soft rubber edge around the block, I'm always smacking this thing into corners and I'm worried I'm going to scratch the paint. So far I haven't, but a soft edge would really make me feel better. Still highly recommended, and the best wash brush you can buy.<br /><br />Yes, the brush smells like a wet petting zoo until it's dry, but very minor draw back for such a great product.
B005WQ1CTU|4|I like these covers so far but fitting them on the seats was absolutely impossible until I tried one thing - lean the seat back fully FORWARD. This gives you just barely enough slack in the cover to slip the cover's retaining clips into place on the rear bottom of the seat cushion.<br /><br />That done, the covers look nice, fit OK, are vastly overpriced but still cheaper than reupholstering the original, incredibly crummy Honda fabric seats that Honda refuses to repair under warranty.
B002E387MO|5|After a YouTube tutorial I had the old part out and this new one in and my turn signals working right again in no time<br />If this 59 yr old gal can do it...you can too!
B00760GTRU|5|My sister's first car was a Acura Legend and she was a Zelda fan growing up.  Why not keep the spirit alive?
B000C0YA9U|1|suppose to be the one where you don't need to remove the cv axle. Not going to use waste of money
B00G4L23PY|4|Bright but not all they are cracked up to be.. Lighting is limited with one 7'Round light. Im running Hella 7&#34; with these bulbs and they do work well.
B002QUJ92C|5|I was very pleased with these glasses! Perfect for riding!!
B000B6CW18|5|Nice quality
B0031HKTZK|5|Worked fine for my Volvo V70 X/C
B00HZSLIVA|5|Fit was perfect, in no time mirror replacements were installed. Will have no problem using again<br />Thanks for asking.
B001MOX6FY|5|Great snd was easy to install
B000CRKOHK|5|These wiper blades are a perfect fit for the 2006 Ford Escape read window.  They do an excellent job of clearing water.
B001RJN56Y|5|I've always strayed away from this air freshener seeking a new scent or something that would last as long. I've been unsuccessful.This air freshener is like my girlfriend. Love of my life, will always give another one a try, but i'll always come back to her.
B005GYA618|5|The shade fits like it was made to fit this specific car, just like the manufacture claims. I'm really happy with it.
B003ZWHLCU|5|Purchased this for my sons car.  Install was very easy. Its the next best thing to a toyota original part.
B001OBMOZ8|5|These rotors went on 77 Chevy K20 front end. For the price and quality these can't be beat. Paired with other Raybestos PG products I am very happy!
B009PTFD0Y|5|I can't say enough about these covers. They are great. Material is strong and plenty of molle loops for attaching storage bags. There is a nice pocket at the front of the seat (between legs).  Material did not fade with the top off (unlike other brand that previously used).  Covers easily wipe down with wet rag.  Dog hair and slobber easily comes off.  Now for the bad. Molle loops are a bit wider than standard molle loops, but still useable. I had no problem attaching bags.
B000NK7992|5|Works as advertised.
B000TYOS3C|4|works as designed
B00KTI0KKI|5|Keys worked out very well, both programed with no problems at the local Chrysler dealer for $40. Dealer wanted to know where I got them, as they worked so well. I have noticed the key shaft has loosened slightly but so little I do not think it will be an issue. Make sure you call for a price at dealer to program, I got one price at a key shop of $125, so beware.
B00JV4TP0C|5|This product is terrific for cleaning your car without soap and water, especially here in drought-stricken California.  When you think about it, it's really less work than the old way.  It works well on glass too.  And the distributor I got it from offered a better price than I could by going direct to Griot's.
B000CNN27S|5|AWESOME Get one!
B000BZL41I|5|Product so far works great. It fits my tank setup perfectly. The sending unit measures well on my 22 gallon gas tank. No issues with any thing so far.
B005MGUJ4O|1|not very good
B00005AXI7|5|We used this thing for years.  As long as thee power doesn't go out it will always serve you well.  If the power goes out, it loses its mind until you set it all up again.
B000N5UCF0|4|Great filter,  a bit wide though so tough to fit in a tight space.
B001U0CFU2|5|Just came back from a 2500-mile motorcycle trip using this bag, and I must say it's great! Good quality materials all over, all sorts of pockets, side opening is a plus, and the fixing system with the bars is quite nice. I would recommend getting some extra elastic straps to fix it to the sissy bar  (it's... big). The only downside is the rain cover, which does not have sealed seams, so 100% waterproof it's NOT. I solved this by covering it first with a large trash bag, then the rain cover. However, the bottom part was still damp, as some of the rain water collected on the bottom of the cover. Maybe they should add a plastic plate on the bottom?
B0089GAUUC|5|Ok, I was a bit skeptical on buying these gloves since they didn’t have any reviews but I bought them anyway.<br /><br />I’ve ordered Large and they fitted perfectly as I usually order large. But the size is good. I really like the material and construction of them. They seem to have a solid construction without been too hard while driving my motorcycle. They took a couple showers and no issues at all but they are a bit warm to use on summer so you will need to have a pair for summer only and use this on rainy season.<br /><br />Overall I’m very pleased with the gloves and their quality. BILT is a very good brand and I was not disappointed with these…
B0056EWADA|1|This item is poorly named.  I am no plumber, but when I read &#34;horizontal float switch&#34; I assume it is actuated horizontally.  The units shipped to me are actuated vertically and do little to nothing horizontally.
B001946YGK|5|this is exactly what our son wanted for Christmas but did not want to spend a lot of money and wanted q good quality jacket for riding he was very surprise when he open the gift and noticed it was a riding jacket.
B00MQ9PYNQ|4|its smaller than it looks , it is 5&#34; as described but the current picture of the star on the white s.u.v is out of scale
B007SUATNI|5|Seems like a good set.  I've had them now for about one and a half years and they're holdoing up fine.  Good deal.
B00C0UECXO|5|Fit perfectly on Grand prix, best price on the market for a authentic Dorman product.
B000Q71N8K|1|I used this one in my truck, I've plugged to lighter socket for 3 hours but it still no cool anything. In whole a trip from CA to NY I must buy many bag of iced...like when you use a cooler. Don't buy this one.
B00BYFE6MI|5|great!
B00CR61720|3|This device works, but the software is not acctually and it does not cover all models. I can't read my ECU...
B003XU3W4U|3|I have a 2012 Yamaha raider. The bag was not wide enough to fit across the front forks. Ending up using it on sissy bar.
B00FJUZY8Y|2|I already own two utility carts - both two shelf models - and I was hoping this three shelf model was going to be a welcome addition to my workshop.  Wow, was I wrong.  After briefly attempting to assemble this Luxor cart, and encountering what I thought was a poorly manufactured cart due to poor part quality and fit tolerances, I then went back and read some of the reviews to see if anyone else had the issues I did. I found one reviewer touched on the lack of sturdiness of the shelves and the build quality - but nobody touched on the fact that the leg posts do not fit into the shelf posts!!!  Huh?  Did they change the design of the parts recently?  DId I get a lemon?  How could I be one of the very few to encounter this?<br /><br />First, a little about the two carts I already own - one is a WEN model, two shelf cart and one is a Husky cart, which is also a two shelf model.  These both were purchased from Home Depot - the WEN for $69 on sale (normally $99) and the Husky for $89.  The WEN cart looks exactly like the Harbor Freight $99 cart - and after further inspection I found out it is... although it is not a bad cart - I like it better than the HD Husky cart.  The main thing I do not like about the two Home Depot carts - only two swivel casters and NO locking casters - which is a pain in the rear on my sloped patio as I constantly battle the loaded cart toodling down the slope....<br /><br />So you can see from the two carts I already own that my expectations were not through the roof - the two carts I own are sub-$100 carts, and I look for something that is built sturdy that does not carry a high price tag.  It is not like I was comparing this cart to $500 carts that are made of stainless steel - I weighing my inputs against two HD carts that I got for $69 and $89 respectively, and carts made of plastic.  Keep that in mind when reading here - this is NOT my first cart, and my expectations were NOT too high.  Also, this review is only my opinion, others may beg to differ, and I respect that.<br /><br />Now, back to this Luxor cart.  Upon opening the box, the first thing that struck me was the &#34;thinness&#34; of the shelves.  Compared to the two other less expensive carts I own, the shelves are a lot thinner, and flexed with the slightest side pressure.  OK... I initially did not fret.  I was still looking forward to the fact I had four swivel casters, two that locked.  Well, I never got that far.  When I turned the first shelf over to install the posts, I was horrified first at the thin leg post material, and the cheapness of the plastic used.  They are square / channel designed legs, but made of VERY thin plastic, and very brittle plastic in addition - in my opinion.  But that was not the worst part - what was the real head scratcher was THEY DID NOT FIT INTO THE SHELF posts. I played with three or four of the legs posts on three or four different shelf posts, to no avail.  To make the leg posts fit, I would have had to file down the shelf post part... or force them on with a mallet, which would damage the receiving part of the shelf, and gouge out the plastic.  I refused to do that 16 times for the 8 shelf posts!!!!  They should fit, and if there was a concern about them being too loose, they should have designed them with a screw, or nut and bolt system!! If I attempted to force the legs on, it would peel back pieces of the shelf post, and I did not want to go any further.<br /><br />Note that this cart is designed with ZERO screws, bolts, nuts, etc.  NONE.  On one hand some might like that, but with this cart and the way it turned out, even if I did want to keep this cart, that was a minus.  Given the cheapness of the plastic used on the leg posts, there could be nothing but problems down the road.  The thinness of the leg posts, and the cheapness of the plastic simply does not add up to making a press fit design.  This cart is simply NOT made to last.<br /><br />At this point, I have described enough to paint the picture of my thoughts on this cart.  I never went past Step 3 on assembly.  I will stick with carts that are designed with thicker / beefier / sturdier parts, and ones that employ screw, nut and bolt hardware to hold it together.  I cannot believe this cart was more expensive than the two I already own...<br /><br />As a side note, when I went back to HomeDepot.com, I noticed a three shelf cart under the label &#34;H Wilson&#34; that was the EXACT same cart as this one - the picture was the exact stock picture, with the same specs.  HomeDepot wanted $129 for this same cart... so obviously this cart is made in one factory, then marketed by more than one brand / company with different labels.  Says a lot to me.  I know that most carts are mass produced these days, but I will stick with the ones that are better built for my needs.<br /><br />The pictures, description and reviews fooled me on this cart - what I thought I was getting and what I got did not match in quality in the end.  I am shocked at all the positive reviews for this cart... but again everyone's needs are different, YMMV, and I respect your assessment of this cart could be different.  Please return that sentiment....<br /><br />Thanks for reading.<br /><br />EDIT:  I did not mention this in my review above, but I did return this cart, and labeled it as &#34;defective&#34; since I could not get the leg posts to mate with the shelf standards without damaging the part or doing some major filing / modification.<br /><br />EDIT 2:::  After reading other reviews - some that say how easy this cart assembled - I have to assume that the company changed the design of the cart, as the one I received did not go together easy at all - not even close.  I am a woodworker, an engineer and work with my hands all the time.  What follows is not a review written by someone who rarely assembles things, quite the contrary.  But I had to write the review for the product I received, and call it honestly.  I know some may not like that, but it is what it is...<br /><br />... if the company has since addressed this design / assemble issue, then that is a good thing.  And if my review had anything thing to do with that, then that is also a good thing.  But if the reviews written before mine that state how easy this cart assembles are true, then the only conclusion I can come up with is a design change somewhere along the way.<br /><br />END EDIT:::ast Step 3 on assembly.

B0012ETPUE|1|After using the H7 Silverstar in two cars over the last few years, I was getting frustrated with their short life, and tried the \\"Ultra\\" version, which claimed longer life.  As noted in some of the other reviews, the light is pretty good, but these too have a very short life.  The two I purchased burned out within 4 months, and that gets very expensive quickly.  After using the Silverstar products for the last 4 years in our cars, I am never using them again.
B000B6JJUK|5|Excellent, work perfect.
B0030UXHTS|5|product came quickly in mail with no problems, was very easy to install and is way better than clear sticker that Toyota puts on the car, highly recommend it
B000C17G5E|3|Heres the deal, M. Phelps is right.  While you have gutted the Air intake and throttle body power steering pump fuel rail, etc. if you cant figure it out get a book def change those coolant elbows to the aluminum ones it  will save you time they are 11$ for new ones, changing all of your top end gaskets i did the head gasket also, YOU have to shave the heads trust me take it off and then to the machine shop if you cant do it at home also give them a good heat bath. If you are changing this because your car overheated and then water locked your baby guess what you shot water down your exhaust and messed up your O2 sensors as well as began the end of your cat converter that will then gum up your exhaust muffler next lol well some new pipes also for your impala, or other 3800 series 2 with the dumbest plastic intake on hot expanding metals and said while we are at it lets shove this hot exhaust gas through the egr into it, Gm needs to fire these people and we bailed them out. Get a whole gasket set and a 24 pack of cold ones your looking at about 8 hours at least just to do the top end at a min estimate.  Also waiting on machine shop if going that route. know how to swing a wrench.  Also invest in a bunch of PB Blaster and patience.  I am a member of the BHG club &#34; blown head gasket&#34; for a 3800 series 2 chevy impala as well a other engines.  I love impalas so the time for me was well spent.

B000BZXHJA|1|The picture of this item shows brake pad retaining clips and guide pin boots, but the box arrived only containing the brake pads themselves, thus necessitating a trip to Napa.<br /><br />Nowhere in the \\"Features & Details\\" nor in the \\"Description\\" of this item does it state these items are not included, leading me to believe the item's picture was representative of the product I purchased.<br /><br />TL;DR: Go with another brand unless you plan on buying retaining clips and pin boots separately.
B00467A3VY|5|Looks great
B00DWKZMV2|2|Unsatisfied, the bulbs were installed and only lasted for about 4 hours and burnt out. The product looked good in the picture.
B00JBI9T0O|5|Perfect fit for 2011 Cruze. Makes a huge difference in the look. The high beams are drastically better than the stock lights. About an hour to install with minimal mechanic experience with help from YouTube video
B00BUT2XIC|5|Excelent...!!!
B003BZZC7W|5|I got these because of the mounting tab being sewn into the belt. Other belts simply wrap around a much bigger metal thing and are not as secure, IMO.
B000C57YQG|5|Moog is supposed to make good parts. I haven't installed yet (ran into bigger problem), so I will see how good the parts are after install.
B007CPLEQK|4|fast and good
B001L62BV8|5|Works perfect. Great service
B0024E6E3C|5|Ordered 2 sets of these for my new camper ..put them on  day after I got them... great fit and look sharp next to the black camper  ...well made and seem sturdy but time will tell ..no problems buckling mine .. ordered the size recommended for my  tire size .. 15&#34; they seem to be a little long and touch the ground by 2-3  inches ..the straps are long and easy to toss behind the tires to get to the other side to buckle them ..then I just lay the extra up on the frame to keep them off the ground ...works for me ..and I don't have to crawl on the ground ...I include the tire chocks when I snap them together and it helps keep the chocks in place as well .. Not sure I like the lining though ..it's nice and soft but if you put them on with dirty tires they will collect grass and dirt easily ... so I rinse the tires and let everything dry before putting them on ...
B0040CRWMS|5|Product was exactly as described and quick shipment.
B00DQJ8T00|1|I have zero reception after installing this antenna on my 2010 Jeep Unlimited Rubicon. Without an antenna at all I receive 0 channels, with this antenna installed I barely catch one channel. Complete waste of money.
B0012X25XE|4|I trust this Brand
B00029JC5S|5|Worked as described.
B00QN399Y6|5|Great product met my expectations
B002UC2WTS|5|This thing is easy to install and a great reminder so that I don't run out of propane. The remote feature makes it easy to locate inside the RV for quick glances.
B000C59NVA|5|Install them on my 99 honda accord and until now is working fine.
B00B3RFOPU|5|Took me about 2 hours to install on my Girlfriend's 2011 Mazda 6. Her car is a base without factory alarm and the kit did not come with the hood switch, so I tied the two wires together for the hood switch circuit which basically bypassed the switch circuit. Everything else works great!
B004GE8Z8K|4|Fit perfect on my 2001 ford ranger
B0012TTEZA|5|I bought these taking a risk on fittment. They Fit perfectly on my G37 sport with the Akebono Calipers. Shipment was super fast and package was small enough to fit in mailbox.
B009PPLDTI|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 New Beetle Turbo S an awesome deal compared to what the dealership.
B009I3CECM|1|i did not like was looking for blue head lights these are even as bright as my stock ones if looking for blue and really bright go with hipro power bulbs are really good
B00NSTSQRE|5|Almost 10 years ago I was broadsided while sitting at a stoplight. It made me very anxious when I get behind the wheel.  In fact I ended up giving up driving for years. Now that my kids are getting older and into activities, I realize I really need to be able to drive them. Public transportation with three kids is tough. Especially when one of them is special needs. However no one likes women drivers around here so they tend to honk at you for every little thing. I go very slow and cautious because of my anxiety.  This magnet is nice for me because it lets other drivers know I am back in the learning phase and hopefully they will be nicer around me.  Disclaimer I have received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion
B00NS6WAWE|5|Totally easy to install and was the right part for the job! I was skeptical because I didn't order factory but glad I took the chance!!  Will definitely buy this brand again!
B002XL2IBS|5|Works perfectly.  Flush your heater a couple times a year very easily.  I got a bunch of scale out the first time I did it.
B0052FRX9E|5|Perfect fit
B009DK4XK6|5|IT WORK GOOD ON MY AUTO, LOOK GOOD ON MY AUTO , I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT .SO WILL YOU
B00317BCZQ|5|FP Stage3 Kit is a must to tune your bike and tame the beast.  I have a Honda VTX 1300, pair valve mod, and Vance & Hines Big Shots, the FP Stage3 will help me set the bike up to optimal performance.
B0031ZDU62|5|Worked perfectly!  Had three coils that we're starting to fail and now the truck runs like new.  Wiring harnesses a little difficult to attach so make sure you hear them 'click'.
B004Y6KRKY|5|Good quality at an excellent price!
B002R1HP6M|3|Had to whittle away some plastic in two places to get it into the car (the pin on the outside near the wheel well, and the inboard tab on top that a screw goes through). Another place needed a little forcing (inboard bottom tab that goes at the lower corner of the grille). Once that was done it was fine. I bought both the driver's and passenger's side units. The driver's side was clearly an exact match for the OEM one I took out. This one differed in a number of small ways other than the above: Little shallow ribs on the surface of the plastic were different in a few places.<br /><br />I suppose the one I got is counterfeit. I'll see how it lasts.
B004RP4U2S|5|Easy to install and looks great
B000N2U5NM|5|Had to remove the distributor gear on our '59 Cadillac to reduce up and down movement. The Pertonix has a tight clearance window between the sensor and magnet. Had to search for a new pin before we could complete the job. Didn't expect that.
B000VU5FL8|5|this is a great little bit of kit for under the hood, marine and and heavy duty environment, its a relay with a gasket seal available, see my other reviews
B00063VZVO|5|great
B000C4LSI2|5|It only took about two or three days for to get here and they included what looked like a heavy-duty all pump driveshaft.
B001HL3S82|5|Its a spark plug. It works as described.
B001G7GRJO|5|I had to replace an injector on my 2000 Avalon and decided to replace all of the seals at the same time. That meant removing the intake plenum. This gasket worked perfectly as a replacement when I put it all back together.
B001P9Z1Y0|1|Just in case someone is looking at this model # 36684 Magnaflow Cat converter.... this is no longer carb CA legal per air resources board as of 05/19/2014.  I live in CA & I just tried to smog my miata today 10/4/14; and the smog tech says that this particular model is no longer legal unless I can show him a receipt / proof that the catalytic converter was purchased prior to 05/19/2014. (which I can't, I just purchased the car from the seller.)<br /><br />But don't take my word for it, please research for yourself.<br /><br />http://arb.ca.gov/msprog/aftermkt/devices/eo/D-193-86.pdf
B00IU4SXAW|5|Cool
B0026PB8RQ|3|Thought I needed it for my R1200RT replacement battery - Didn't need it. Was able to screw the bike cables directly onto the PC680 battery.
B000C40TDC|4|Mounts fit well and work as expected.  Only thing I did not like was on rear hole for mounting stud  instead of a slot for stud a large rectangular opening was there which required a large washer instead of factory size washer which looks like not correct.
B000SL4AA2|5|Does the job, Definitely not a pro model but I didn't pay for a pro price.  gets you out of a bind and is reliable.
B00OCYXTYY|1|Worst product ever.  Backed as a Kickstarter backer, no support. No help.  Does not connect to phone after multiple updates to the phone and the app.  No new firmware as promised.<br /><br />DON'T BUY!
B00LNO21H2|5|Cool
B00171V20S|5|This is the oem part number for my 84 corvette, other brands have adapters which DO NOT clear the hood !! this one fit perfect, just remove the adapter turn the adapter around, clip it back in per the instructions and you are all set, granted the driver's side wiper does skip along the windshield sometimes BUT it fits and works good.
B007TYC2I8|2|Purchased from 4WD Parts for a 1980 Jeep CJ-7.  Supposed to fit without a adapter.  Doesn't fit, no one seems to know what it takes to fit now.
B006EGAIII|5|These are built quite sturdy and feel as though they can hold up a pickup truck although I don't really have one to test it with. I used it to prop up my Nissan Juke and it worked perfectly. The job was to repaint the muffler so I had to back up onto these. From all the reviews, I thought they would slip but they didn't budge one bit. It is a 17 degree incline so it is perfect for cars that ride a bit low.
B0052FRT2A|5|Great Product! Exactly what I expected. Positive review across board. A++Seller
B004NYOHK8|4|Think they are going to work great but there was no instalation instructions,specs or any paper work sent with the lights.
B0055DQ2CW|5|nice item. great fit
B000EJTI4G|5|Mine has clocked ten years now and although small, has been the best I ever had. Beats all I can find at WalMart and Advance Auto Parts (March 2015). This unit also checks battery voltage before and after, and has a charging mode button which works! The fault modes are also helpful. Looking for one right now to use in another location.
B005LDBU0U|5|i saw a man on u-tube said he used one for years . so I said i will gave it a try.so now the roads i wouldn&#34;t ride on are smooth again.It dont get must better than this.
B0039HD4P4|5|Needed this for my F250 Super Duty, this came with a wiring harness and three lights. The schematics were pictures, not Chinglish, although the product is obviously Chinese. The lights are bright, the installation on my Bull Bar was simple, the price was within my budget.<br />Now three years later, they are almost rusted through, started rusting after about 1 year, now looking for a replacement, lights still very bright, but won't buy these again.
B0058ECK24|4|This chain plier, the shape and the use of it is wonderful, but the quality not what I would like, nerveless I use it  a lot because is the best tool on the market to close loops
B00JBDG11E|3|yes, it's fancy and pretty and it does work and its convenient and folds up nicely.  But at that price i expect all the bells and whistles to work flawlessly.  Let me start by saying i may be jaded because when i bought this, the only descriptions were from the European version, which has lights, a cable chain and a ball hitch.  When i received the much scaled down (no lights) USA version, i was instantly displeased.  However, what really gets me is the fact that the ramp does not work. There are lots of nice platform racks out there but i wanted uber-convenience so the ramp was key.  Unfortunately, it doesn't mount, it doesn't stay on and it doesn't fit wider bike tires (like beach cruisers). the ramp is useless.  That's my rant, now i'm going to kick myself for spending so much on a bike rack.
B002GJVLOC|5|This tube was much cheaper than local prices and very high quality. There was a huge price difference than at the local shops.  If you've never done a tube replacement I recommend buying the tire spoons and watching a how to video on youtube.
B000F5LJAA|5|If you are doing any service to BMW and Mercedes this tool is a great set to make sure your able to do the different fan clutch combinations.  Quality and great case
B006Z9TZ9M|5|This stuff is amazing! I have an old 91 toyota MR2 with T-tops that used to leak like CRAZY, my seats would be absolutely soaked after a good rain and new T-Top seals for this car are near $400 so I was looking for other options. I was recommended This product by a few friends online, normally I dont buy &#34;cheap fixes&#34; that I hear about online but this was 17 bucks so with expectations of this stuff failing to work as advertised I went ahead and picked up a tube...<br /><br />Well, we just had our first hard rain in about a month and I have to say Im Impressed... Not a single drop got into the car, I recommend this product to anyone with any kind of leaking seals, it does the job!
B00435HRKY|5|Great product. I like that it's fast drying and has no odor.
B0024NSLNY|5|I love my Jeep Limited, but it is 13 years old.  The new head lights do make the car look new, and if you just stare at the front your going to be a very, very happy camper.  I also got the new fog light covers and that really furthers the illusion of the &#34;new&#34; car feel.  So, it is a NEW CAR right until the light turns green and I go from first to second gear and my transmission sounds like it is doing me a favor.  If I don't plan on drag racing, its all good.  I really do like them.<br /><br />They do adjust so look harder at that if you feel one has a lazy eye.
B003172AAW|5|This unit is clean and one guy said it looks like a Hornets Nest. It cools the oil while filtering and flow rate is greatly improved. A #1 buy to save your motor and with the Rogue Oil Scavenger, you'll have the cleanest oil in town...
B001G4Z5J0|5|Easy to assemble, looks great and works great. I would buy again if I need another.
B000C9QU5I|4|Original Delco part for about the same price my local parts store wanted for lesser quality after market stuff.  You just gotta wait a couple days and then hope it fits.
B007A8OD1M|5|Exact replacement for factory chain.  Works Great
B00APRSI6G|1|Absolutely horrible.  I would never buy an alarm from them. It shorted out fried almost started my scooter on fire. Threw out in middle of the street.
B0056JC02Q|5|After placing this product on my window, I've came to the realization that there wasn't any way to update the marks. Recently I ran into some &#34;situations&#34; where I should be adding a mark in the last column. It would be nice if there were additional sticker marks that we can add.<br /><br />Thank you for considering my request.
B000H7TQGK|5|Very easy to use, much better than a rubbing compound.  Took the scratches out.
B000EDUUJO|5|This  product  should  be  sold  everywhere, better  with  all  food markets. This is the  best  way to  recycle those  plastic  bags and have them  handy for  garbage, or  other  stuff, but the  convenience of them  is  great!
B000BOAX1G|5|Quick delivery and seems to be made well
B0008G5ENY|5|I now can hook up a trailer to my Sante Fe by using the rise on the adjustable ball mount
B003IOITIK|3|The &#34;Check Engine&#34; light on my dashboard began staying lit, and my car had been having trouble starting when it was partly warmed up (such as after a short trip to the grocery store).  So I did some research and learned about OBD-II onboard diagnostic codes.  There are less expensive OBD-II scanners, but I was in a hurry to solve the car trouble so I selected the Actron CP9550 based on its somewhat more favorable reviews and additional features. (I even paid $10 for overnight shipping.)  It was easy to use and provided the information (crankshaft position sensor circuit malfunction) that I needed to let me explain to the car mechanic exactly what was needed.  It also allowed me time to research the sensor and symptoms online before I spoke with the mechanic, so I was comfortable saying No to him when he suggested I also replace another part (the camshaft position sensor).<br /><br />It doesn't need batteries; it sips power from the car battery through the OBD-II port.  I plan to keep it in the car in case the &#34;Check Engine&#34; light comes on while I'm on the road.<br /><br />There's a warning to wash your hands after use due to lead in the cable, so I considered returning it.  Instead, I wrapped the cable with saran wrap and tape, but I'm not certain that will block the transfer of lead to my hands.
B00BLPS29E|5|Very pleased
B005JU5UMO|3|shipped fast<br />was new in box<br />Wiper steaks like crazy<br />had it over 2 months now<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.
B0035U9OMM|5|much better ride
B008FL0B1E|5|This unit was an exact fit in my Honda Dash.  It uses 4 different sizes back there.  Have fun figuring that out. I used Honda OEM Charts to help me.  This bulb is brighter but only by a bit. Mostly the benefit is the clarity, high contrast and white light much more toward the blue and away from the yellow spectrum.  I don't mean they are remotely blue, they are not.  It just does not have a hint of yellow. This really updated my dash to a more modern Lexus/Cadillac (as well as many others newer models) looking type of dash.  These are polarized like all LED's so be certain you check your install for any reversed polarity installed bulbs.  If you find them, just rotate them 180 degrees in the socket and you are golden. I don't think I'd change these out for grins and giggles but since I had several lamps out it was an ideal time to upgrade to this LED lamp. You will enjoy your upgraded, high contrast, whiter albeit only somewhat brighter dash.  Also, be careful where you put LED's since your computers ECM especially with the Can-bus II data stream can get real ornery about having LED's in certain areas that didn't originally call for them.  Other areas it just will not matter.  Often it's just trial and error. Regardless these bulbs rock. Good luck. DHA - Columbus, OH
B001GH1OPG|5|Working out great using 315's on stock rimes on my JKU tailgate with the stock tire carrier and the Rugged Ridge 3rd brake light relocations bracket. and the MBRP tire carrier extension.
B000UOBIZC|5|Good product and light weight which does not add much weight to your motorhorme or tailer. Very durable and will not rot.
B00JGQM1WO|5|best oil for the price. Coupled with Fram oil filter and air filter made significant difference in performance.
B000UK3RT6|5|Put these in my 2007 kawasaki vulcan 900 classic. Had just put new NGK regular plugs in it right before these. There was a difference in power and the way the bike ran. Not a ton of power but there was more. Also the bike seems to start and idle better. Put these into a bike that had just a week ago got new plugs so its not an old used plug to new iridium plug difference. The mpg are a little higher as well.
B001GF7MFE|5|Live in Arizona, it truly is worth the money steer wheel and seat belt aren't on fire when I get into car.
B0066KPYTK|5|This one posed a bit of a challenge. This new, red H emblem is affixed in place of the chrome emblem that was showing some age; the chrome was rubbing off. I had to carefully, surgically cut away the vinyl that was inside of the chrome H. The finished product, overall, looks fabulous. I started to give it a four star rating, but I took it up to a five because it met my expectations. All total, it was worth the effort.
B00F1JFE9C|5|This product looks and sound great on my 2005 Yamaha v-star 650 custom!
B005C6KIVS|5|The scannee works great, couldn't be happier with this purchase.
B000FW61SI|1|threw it out after about a week it no longer fir my visor because the clips are crap!  save your money.
B00BU779KQ|5|Love the item, great product and easy to install. Used in my 2012 Toyota Tacoma.
B0000AY69V|1|I'm glad bought this exact item through my local auto store on sale for $2.98.  It does a VERY POOR job of absorbing moisture and is nothing like a true chamois cloth.  Even after washing it in hopes of removing any residue, it still failed to perform.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, a cotton towel will do a better job.  Mine is now in the garbage.
B002SVHD0O|5|Fits perfect
B0050VGZLM|3|Batteries wear out too quickly and now I can't find the remote (my fault).  Now I need to buy another set so when I do find it I can attach a finder to it.  (just kidding).
B002CF3RHE|5|I've used this 2x pulling a 7,000LB Vehicle using my 16,000LB winch.. Solid and well made!<br />Hope it will last  a long time, but by the looks of it it is very well built and if you keep it clean and in it's packaging while stored should be fine for many years. !
B004I168K8|5|Fits and looks just like the broken factory light I replaced.
B0094E5IWI|5|Nice replacement for the large Harbor Freight sand blaster cabinets. Will continue to buy again.
B0041VLZYE|5|Great quality, practicle & looks great! A lot of detail.<br /><br />Received it promptly.<br /><br />Would recommend it to family, friend or foe.
B00EH162M8|5|Awesome! Love it!
B002CM75M0|1|The 1st time it showed up, it was missing 1/2 the bolts required to install it.  I figured no big deal, any big box store should have them.  Wrong.  Nobody carries this size or fine thread.  I contact Amazon Prime and they ship me another.  This time other pieces are missing.  Between the 2 kits you'd think I could make one whole one?  Nope.  Just the right amount of things missing to make both kits unusable.  Plus the bolts I was able to attach couldn't take any torque whatsoever without the threads splitting off.  Worthless product.  Rugged Ridge just lost a customer.  Warrior Products just gained one.  That &#34;Made in the U.S.A&#34; label makes a BIG difference.
B002GOEBG2|5|Product came smashed in box and poking through.  No structural damange however it was scraped up.  I didn't care much personally.    Instructions are amazing.  Maybe the best I've ever seen.  They were in English (not translated to English), correct, and thorough.  I can't say enough about how good these single page, single side instructions are.    Design is very clever.  They use a fishwire technique that is brilliant.    To do this install you want a floor jack, silicone sealant, and a sawzall or other such device for cutting plastic.  I expected the floorjack but just as a warning you really do need a cutting device and the sealant for this job.  You also need english and metric wrench/sockets and torx drivers.  You need english because the product is American, but the car is German :)    Install time was NOT 45 minutes.  It took me and my buddy almost 2 hours.  That's painfully embarasing to admit given that we're both engineers and garage monkeys, but we weren't in a rush, I had the flu, and we spent a lot of time doing the fishing wire technique.  It's brilliant, but still takes a lot of fiddling.    Finished result is awesome.  Product is stout.  This really opens the doors to what I can do with my TDI now and at $120 & 2-day shipping... who can complain!
B00L425SPA|5|Delivered promptly and the battery was ready to go. Very smooth transaction, no issues at all. Also the description of the battery made it easy to select the right one for my scooter. This is very important because some description are not to clear. So I appreciated that it was easy to select the right battery.
B0002KR88A|4|Good item
B00CMY2OLK|5|Good quality, paint is holding up real good.
B007KCXG0C|5|Fit just fine on an '05 Sport Trac. Fraction of the price of OEM. The materials used seem to be of cheaper quality, but at this price I'm not sure I care. My only concern is that the reflective surface inside the assemblies are made of plastic - with a chrome-like paint deposited on the surface. The original Ford assemblies seemed to be made of a ceramic material. I haven't run them for a long time, so my only concern is how they're going to hold up to the heat of the fog light bulbs. I guess I'll see and update this review sometime down the road. So far though, I'm happy with them.  Edit 6/19/15 - Almost been a year now, they've seen a lot of use and have held up fairly well. No problems with the reflective inner surface. The outer lenses have begin to show some pitting, but I drive on dirt roads daily, so the truck gets abused in general. Otherwise, holding up just great.
B0063GKHPI|3|This product worked well on badly scratched lenses on Prius. However, I needed to augment the sandpaper as the supplied sheets are quite small. The finishing solution worked nicely; however, I ran short to cover both headlights on the Prius.
B00FC22JU0|3|The ballasts got very hot while running the lights. I have used other HID lighting systems and the ballast would get warm but not hot. I could only hold my finger on them for a couple seconds after only running the lights for about 5 minutes. I have deinstalled them and I plan on sending them back. On a positive note, they are super bright and very white ( I purchased the 6000k) the brights on these work very well too (high beams).<br />Maybe they are supposed to get this hot? I am not sure, but it seemed like a hazard to keep them in.
B0049DYW3A|5|First time working on my car, installed very easy! Plenty of Youtube videos for would-be Mechanic Do It Yourselfers! Highly recommended!
B000BPG4LI|4|Nice element, but one of the two ordered was identified as a 5500 w on the packaging but was actually a 4500 w.
B00SG9PG4M|5|Great product really like how the wind blows over you a little bit better and it bolts right on
B004B61B34|5|Fits perfectly.  No surprises.
B006WQRPEK|5|Worked great
B0042VSE38|5|I had to cut the seat belt to get out.  When the seat belt locks up in an accident you will wish you had this thing.  Just make sure you can reach it in the event of and accident.  If you cannot reach to the glove box to get it will do you no good.  I keep it in the center arm rest compartment.  Never tried to break a window with it but I'm sure it will work.
B0041TQSCK|4|Very affordable for the price and great quality, also i found an easy way to replace the filter, will buy again.
B00APOCT32|5|Good
B00OX1WIT8|5|Product had speedy delivery.<br />I am satisfied with organizer.
B002R0R3D8|5|See my original comment for the Driver Side replacement too...since I purchased both.  Who needs an OEM item when the replacement was actually BETTER!!!!!!!
B000IWFPIW|5|Big things only work well when the small parts function properly. I have a '88 minivan. The bushing on the wiper linkage deteriorated beyond usefulness. What I needed was in this package. There is a variety, so one could be covered on other models, too. Works great.
B00585DNDI|5|Looks good on my jeep
B00390BS7C|5|I used this to remove the O2 sensors on my 2005 Silverado and it worked exactly as advertised. They were stuck a bit, so I had to use PB Blaster to get help loosen them up. I wish this had a 1/2\\" drive so I could use my pry-bar and get some more leverage, but it ended up working fine with my 3/8\\" ratchet and a couple taps with a rubber mallet. It also would have been nice if it actually attached to the ratchet and wouldn't fall off, but it still worked fine. Just don't move it around much.
B006X8AR8S|5|Really love it easy to put on looks great
B000C11JLQ|4|installed easily  saved money my shop charges $370 per window  waiting to see how it holds up  last one (shops) lasted less than 2 yrs
B007XWDEWO|5|Looks classy on our truck
B001HX9N02|5|I got this as a present for my husband. The size of the decal is great, the print looks awesome, and I am overall very pleased with this purchase. He is excited for it as well, and is eager to adhere it to his car :)
B000S2SHZK|5|I have a 2003 Tahoe that had no heat n the rear seats....I got this and with the help of a YouTube vis figured out how to install it....pretty easy to put in and the rear heat works like a charm now!
B0036E9VB6|5|I have only used this twice but so far I am very happy with the performance. I drive a Toyota Tundra so it has pretty big tires, the pump had the tire filled in seconds. I followed the instructions regarding starting the engine before starting the pump and had no problems. It also pumped up the very flat tire on our lawn tractor pretty quickly as well. This seems to be a pretty solid built item at a good price.
B000CMFSYY|5|These Floor Mats are great. Heavy Duty and durable. they don't slide around and they protect the floor very well!
B002IAS3R2|5|Save a ton of weight and makes your 14 sound like it should. As quiet as can be at cruising speeds but a nice quiet howl at higher throttle positions. Highly recommend this slip on.
B000C40ST2|5|ARE SO NICE
B009ZBQOYG|3|A bit noisy
B002I2OGNK|4|Stickers arrived quickly and went on with no problems.  Now my mailbox stands out on the street and the postman knows who I am.  Also -- I'm available for crime fighting!  haha
B000CLQOOS|4|Drum in hat parking brake shoes can be a monster to install, these weren't too bad, probably partly because it's a truck and the large brake diameter means the whole parking brake assembly isn't the same size as the axle flange, the extra little bit of size makes it a lot better to work on without pulling the axle out.
B0085KGOIE|5|Love it! It's the perfect size to hold a lot of gray water from our tent-trailer without being too horribly heavy to move. And, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the metal piece that you can use to hitch it to your car for easy transport was included with this model.
B00UX8D7YK|5|Very nice leds got it as a gift, they fixed the problem of the shipping thank you.
B00DDV2NL2|5|Excellent product, works well, use on both iPhone and iPad. Connects to all vehicles. Have to buy add on apps for this but you can scan the vehicle and find out what modules it will connect to before you purchase the apps.
B000CQBMSG|2|A neighborhood cat was able to shred this cover to pieces within less than 24 hours.  Thought the material would be more durable.
B0046I9FSU|5|The key fob was cheap to purchase, quick to arrive, and easy to setup. So far everything is working great.
B00NLQQ1BW|4|My lady loved it lol
B00JAA847W|5|This is a cheap and easy way to freshen the look of your bleak dash. You may not even realize it until you have this installed. Makes you want to drive more! Without them, there's no contrast in the dash, so it really makes some eye candy :P. At first, I found the rings a bit thick, just look at hoe close the speedometer needle gets to hitting it, but it's not that bad in the end. It grew on me but that might bother someone. They seem a bit cheap, but that's because they are. Nonetheless, it's got the perfect amount of shine to them. Very OEM look.<br /><br />As for installation. I have no experience with cars whatsoever and it took me an hour, and 30 of those minutes were spent cleaning off dust I kept noticing. So two words of advice.<br />1. Work in a dust free environment, and look very closely for dust and other little things to save a lot of time re-opening the cluster.<br />2. Unplug the battery. There's so many questions online (in my experience) if you should to keep the electronics working properly and to avoid an airbag light. Just do it. Don't take the chance. Be creative if your short on tools, I used a wire cutter to twist it off (and a screw driver)
B000XRHRZQ|5|Not exactly as stock, but no one will know except me!
B0006IX87S|5|works great. met my expectations.
B005QZMWEQ|5|excellent product, 100% quality guaranteed
B000CO8UZG|4|I purchased these pads for my 2001 Honda Prelude as a replacement for my OEM pads and they seem a lot more responsive than the former. My next pads will be fresh OEM's and I'll update this review again to give another opinion on the performance of these pads and whether or not they are worth the money.<br /><br />For now though, I love them and they are worth the premium price (which, quite frankly, isn't that premium haha).<br /><br />Kudos, Necrodox.
B00065ZIJ2|5|Once you figure out the key can only be inserted in one particular orientation then it's great!
B000FOIJXQ|1|I own a 2004 Tacoma PreRunner and the front bumper and wheel well trim has faded. I have been using the \\"Back to Black\\" for years. Was happy to see a kit that would relive me of applying this every time I washed the truck. I read other reviews and went out and bought a small painters plastic bucket and some foam brushes. I washed the truck once, then used the 4oz of cleaner 5 times to ensure a really clean surface, which the cleaner does a fantastic job doing. Let dry for 1 hour then I easily popped the foam portion of the bottle off the dye and poured it into my bucket and started applying. It looked to have gone on perfectly. About 20 seconds later I see that it was streaking and pooling up. brushed it again but the dye was starting to dry and nothing could be done. I reapplied and it started to once again streak. No matter what I tried to do to stop this from happening nothing would work. So I just gave in and let the product dry. Once it had, the areas where it built up began flaking off. The next day there where hundreds of bare sections where the product just dried and came off on it's own accord.  Not sure what happened? I did what the bottle reads and this was my result. Now, I'm looking at hours of work to remove it.  As a side note. I had believed this was a \\"dye\\". To me this means that the chemical would be absorbed into the plastic (like tie dye shirts). Was disappointed to see that it was more like  a \\"Mop and Glow\\" solution. The product stays on top of the material and is really just a cheap cover up.
B000PDNPYK|5|Bought this to help with taking apart laptops, cell phones, consoles without marring/scratching the plastic like a metal screwdriver would.  The spudger is tough and hasn't broken at the tip or snapped when used as a lever.<br /><br />My only complaint is that shipping is really high, but I won't mark down the product for that.  The tool itself was only about a dollar, but ordering two cost a whopping $13 in shipping charges.  If I could find another source for these, I would buy it elsewhere.
B00DGWZ5XG|5|Easy to install, holds odds and ends.
B000182DYC|5|Awesome fit and smooth.
B00D329UYO|5|Excellent. Easy to clean. Great for winter weather
B001QV877K|5|Great Price,Excellent Made,works Perfect,Fast Shipping
B004ZF3DYG|5|Worked as advertised.  Great product for the price.  Highly recommend it.
B009FQZURS|5|LOVE IT - Put one on my 2007.5 Extended Cab 2500 Duramax. It looks awesome. It took a while to ship but totally worth the wait. Gotten tons of compliments. It really sets the truck off... If you get this make sure you get the Fab Fours CH08-A2051-1 Heavy Duty Winch Bumper too. Zombie apocalypse bring it on...
B00BN46IDA|5|very expensive looking,,  good quality key chain..ive gotten many compliments on it
B0059HJFU0|5|I bought this pump for use on 1-gallon jugs of SuperTech gear oil. Fits perfectly, with different length tubes for other containers. It easily pumps the relatively viscous fluid, and one-ounce-per-pump means you won't spend hours filling a large differential. Pump handle has a notch to hold the hose when not in use. Perfect product for the price.
B00B79XIQ6|5|Fast deliver. My dad said it was cute. But they haven't opened it yet. Sent to my parents as a gift.
B003RY53U8|5|We thought they were just as good as alladin mugs from 30 years ago
B00FH3YB5K|3|I thought this was such a great idea since I hate putting my purse on the floor.  The material is sturdy and made of good quality.  Cons: The plastic to adjust the cords gets in the way of the hinges, I have to be careful when closing the console.  I am able to close the console but I need to re-position the plastic every time I need to open the console.  Pros: I decided to keep it because my kids put the iPad there....I guess we have some use in it so I'm keeping it.
B004P5W66M|5|Found the right replacement for my make and model for my vehicle and it's new.<br />Cheaper than going to the dealer and better than a junk yard.
B002BN5ZT0|5|These led bulbs are a perfect replacement for the standard 15 watt 12 volt incandescent bulbs supplied with rv overhead lights. I was able to drop my total lighting draw from 285 watts (if all lights were on) to 33.25 watts (with all lights on), although they are more expensive then some other led bulbs and much more expensive then incandescent, I haven't had a single complaint after 1 season using them, the amount of light is good, the color of the light is perfect and my batteries last much longer when camping without shore power
B007VLFA4M|4|These lights are definitely on the purple side rather than the pure white i was hoping for. But they still look great, they're bright and get the job done. When I first installed this panel, it didn't work. I switched the adapter around and the panel still didn't turn on. I wiggled the wires and after messing with it for 2-3 minutes they finally came on. I assume it was a short in the wire somewhere, so hopefully they'll work moving forward.
B002IA9HRW|4|This product looks like you would expect. The color of light is cool and unique. For less than $35, a great deal.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Work great.
B004EIAADG|1|Does not work as advertised
B00IB5NJ0O|5|Shipped quick and is as described. Worked the only time I've needed to use it.
B006R34PB4|5|Great led lights, pretty much plug and play, only tough part is having to remove all plastic covers in my car to put these in. The color is clean, not too blue and no where near yellow (which is what comes stock in my car). Very easy way to improve car look. Arrived on time, everything works and lights look great.
B000JFJLP6|5|bought as christmas gifts was put to use within 24 hr  performed better then expeted, built-in chahger for battery pak is a great feature.
B000IYWXNU|5|fits on my 1997 toyota 4runner sr5, no complaints does what it does.
B0050I0W6E|1|This key suck.
B00DNX92TQ|2|Bulky hard edged magnets. Horrible zippers. Old style cell phone pocket.
B005NLQAHS|3|A little finicky. It doesn't always connect.
B00895BT3U|5|No disappointment here. This insert fits perfect and looks great on my 2003 Silverado. VERY easy to install and is tightly secured. Highly recommend this product.
B00A8NKKIQ|5|Clicked together great with a Leatt (as it should), and it made my dad feel like he was wearing futuristic body armor. His words, not mine.
B0031P6AIW|5|This was easy to install and works great!  Make sure you match up both sides or you will have issues when trying to latch it.
B000COBK8A|5|EXCELLENT , 100 % RECOMMENDED
B00839V21Q|5|Love them! Go Sox!!
B005U7EAPY|4|I must say that these mats are really nice. They are cupped at the edges to hold-in water or snow and are of heavy rubber are ribbed. They fit perfect front ad back and should hold up nicely thru the winter....Glad I bought them....
B0003041WK|1|Specifically purchased this to loosen the cartridges for the water valves on my hot tub.  After at least a dozen attempts, lots of time for it to soak in, etc. Nothing at all moved.  The product may work as stated, but I'd nver purchase it again, do not trust the advertisement and believe this to be just another ripoff.
B001TXVXU8|1|Never shipped. Had to cancel order.
B002XHDHPS|4|It's easy to apply however the words are smaller then I expected.  The phase came in one long strip so I cut it to make it appear larger on the wall.  Overall satisfied with the product.
B00P24U85G|5|It's assume. Everyone that has seen it thinks it came with the vehicle.
B0018N93LA|5|Good overall dye for all leather.  It is a great color.  Good for boots, holsters, and knife sheaths.  If you are one to live in a state that has the common sense to allow you to carry and you are tired of the usual black holsters and knife sheaths, this is it.
B001OBMOZS|5|As the Woodmiester said above.  Picked these up for 9.95 each. I bought 4 only needed two. But heck,  at that price I figured why not.  I own a 75 C30. And these fit perfect.
B008D6HGD2|4|Fast shipping great price .
B00HUC8R06|5|Great customer service by the BumperDuo representative! The product is durable and looks good on the car. I would highly recommend BumperDuo if you want to protect your car.
B00BQWQLQI|3|I did not see the expected improvement in headlight performance over my original bulbs that the Phillips ad suggested.<br />Supplier packaging was skimpy - the original Phillips container was sturdy though.
B000COU1TE|1|This product never stopped anything from leaking on Cadillac North-star engine. However, I expected it wouldn't due to it's aluminum engine, but it was worth a try anyway.
B000FW2NNA|5|Used them to tie down a tarp over our outdoor dog kennel. We live right on the coast, and they've held up under almost hurricane force winds.
B0068BZMO4|2|This fender light has the base of the light bulb protruding below the main body of the light.  You will either need to make a very, very  thick rubber gasket or drill three holes in your fender. One for each of two screws and a large one for the light bulb housing base. I pulled out the bulb, cut the metal protrusion off, and then wired an LED light in. It worked very well and I only needed two small holes in the fender.
B001AMA6MY|1|I purchased two shocks for my 2005 Honda civic on February 25 2013, and I kept the package closed the entire time until now, because I was waiting to buy new brakes and roaders. I open the box only to find out that the shocks in the package were used, NOT NEW. Unfortunately for me it has been a few months from the time that I bought the shocks for me to send it back, but my point is, WHY? WHY are they selling used items and advertise it as new. I am very unsatisfied with this purchase, and I hope that the person behind it gets punished for this, because I had to go to AutoZone and buy two brand new shocks to replace the ones that I got from amazon.
B006YWNFIW|4|great for very minor blemishes. Goes on easy, just dont let it sit too long. Love this stuff alot .
B00GY6TU64|5|This is the first time I purchased this item. I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of this item. The only suggestion I can make is to improve the installation instructions.
B007O0A5YA|5|I bought this earlier this year and installed it along with the rear shifter bushing on my 2013 WRX. Quick tip - get some car ramps if you're doing it at home, it'll be safer and you'll have more space than with car jacks. Also, make sure you have enough daytime light, and bring a flashlight (or LED equipped cellphone) for the spots when you need to look inside.<br /><br />As far as the front shifter bushings go, the install is pretty straightforward as there isn't a lot of moving parts around, and you can make things easier by removing the part from the car, replacing the bushings, and then putting it back in.<br /><br />Again, the feel is definitely crisper and more defined and it's a cheap DIY project that you'll enjoy the results of
B009AD8RN0|5|I love this backpack because it has an awesome section for my laptop and holds all my other college supplies also. It is strong and durable and I absolutely love it!!
B000BZZPUY|1|It dose not fit 2000 Protege 1.6L  even when the Amazon web site say it does . Manufacture web site say it fit 2001, 2002, 1.8L and 2.0L
B00G620ZVU|5|Great lights
B0048EHITU|5|Nice mat.
B002WBXODK|4|It is very light weight but what I expected.  I have used the Dowco before and typically get about 3 years out of them.
B000NMDFNY|3|When I take the cap off I know this is only some kind of detergent - there's foam in the bottle. It could only be used to wash away some dirt that stick on the car. I was planning to use it to deal with some scratches on my car, but obviously there's nothing you can RUB with this product.
B007VR7EUO|3|ok
B009DK2GSC|2|Product did not match my car after i was told that it's the same match for those years.
B007HYAUZW|2|These were beautiful at first. Two leds instead of just one. Pure white light, but they don't last. One of the leds went out on one. One unit stopped altogether, just after just a couple of months. The screws are too short to grab the wood if it isn't perfect and hard. No rubber plugs for the screw holes. A disappointment for the money. Not like the ones before we got from Home Depot that lasted until the batteries died. They definitely could be better. Maybe you will have better luck.
B000CITK8S|5|I store the tractors in unheated areas of storage, so keeping the tractor battery fresh is important.  These charge only when needed and do a battery conditioning when needed to keep the battery in top shape.  I have one 6-7 years old (battery still good), and this one on a new tractor at our other home (which I hope is also working fine-find out in the spring when I get back up there).
B0089EY4EM|3|Solar powered to spin but sometime needs to tap it to start.<br />Under direct hot sun it spins automatically.<br />Nice to look at when the dollar sign rotates, the studs on the sign gliters uner the sun.
B009WGQKLQ|5|i was doubtful that these would be of use but they are gr8 when having to work on metric and other oddball shaped fasteners (square heads) - but they are pretty remarkable, and freed up a lot of space in my toolbox - i always hated looking for some deep sockets and not  finding what i needed - sure these are a bit weird - and take some getting used to  - but they work great -
B00GI77I3G|5|A+++++++++
B0030E5HS8|5|This winch has helped my out about a dozen times in the last year since it was purchased. For the price, I couldn't be happier. A little while back I had to pull a 9000 lb diesel truck out of a frozen mud hole. Once I had my vehicle anchored to a tree, the little Superwinch prevailed even at it's maximum rated capacity. The only weak point of this winch is my battery setup, but that really isn't a weak point of the winch at all. In conclusion, I couldn't be happier with the purchase for the price.
B001LTVCBU|4|I have been using these to dry my black Mustang for almost a year now and I really have no complaints about their quality. They are soft and work well! The only thing that was surprising was that mine are like a deep purple color and I was more expecting pastel purple or pink, but that did not matter to me because they are still great in my opinion
B000BO8M78|2|This ad states that the product is 5 square feet. On the packaging it states 4.5 and that is ONLY if you include both sides of the chamois. I am very disappointed
B000FOIJXQ|5|I just followed the directions on the labels, It's easy to follow, prep for and use!    I've got a 1986 BMW 535i, which has quite a bit of (was) graying trim and I only used about half of the product with a single coat, so I'd guess that one order of this would do most any vehicle two coats. - great value.    The trim on the car looks brand new, completely changes the look and age of the car!    I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will certainly use this again on different vehicles later on...
B001JT5NIU|4|This product is used mainly for the door panels.  Its pretty thin, but it works better than the stock factor plastic that comes with normal vehicles.  Easy to install as it has anhesive backing.
B000BZI1O6|5|good
B0082JR2AM|5|Perfect for what I needed
B001GH5O34|1|Did not fit my 2011 2500 duramax as stated on the Amazon  site. This part number KG09107 shows to fit on Amazon, but the Daystar site shows it to fit 1999-2010. Waited several months before install and found out after dropping  the factory parts off. Reinstalled the factory  parts and called it a day.
B000IY6JEE|2|will not purchase again, these lift supports are very thin and feel cheaply made. the main rod is very weak and bows when closing the hood. they do the job and I will keep them until they fail
B000AXWUA0|5|From the time I put the Taz Head Hitch Plug on my truck, I got numerous compliments on it. In fact, if I did not have it locked down, it would have been taken in less than 5 minutes after I installed it. I love it! It adds a lot to the decor of my truck and I am proud to have this item on the back of my truck. I have tried many items on the hitch receiver but none have stood out as fantastic as my Taz.
B000KKJRRW|5|Works fine at a great price
B004M06BRA|5|VERY HAPPY WITH THE FUZZY DICE THERE IN MY CAR AT THE MOMENT, NOT DAMAGED AT ALL, IVE HAD DAMAGED THINGS FROM OTHER SITES BUT NOT THIS ONE
B008JORKP2|5|We love this thing!
B007TYCXO6|5|Bolt in good!
B001DX9KDG|4|love it. It works grate and fits right in your pod. Only thing more i would of liked is if it came with a electric boost sensor like AEM's boost gauge. So you do not have to run a boost hose in the cabin. Overall for the price its grate.
B000SKV4P2|5|This is the second year I've used  this oil. I know it's rated for 15,000 miles but I still do 2 oil changes a year. Still saving a good bit of money!
B000OWTI2K|3|Loved the set, but one item was leaking in box and put an erosion in my hardwood floor that has to be refinished. Was storing for Christmas present and didn't notice the leak until the damage was done. Lost 1/3 of the wheel cleaner product due to poor packaging, too.
B008B0HGK8|5|It does not list it, or show it. but it DOES come with the front camshaft thrust plate.
B005DJRDDK|5|I received my deflector and had my brother put it on my car.  It not only looks good, but helps deflect bugs and rocks, protecting my hood and windshield.
B003085W8O|5|These work AWESOME. I race desert and at the end of 100 miles my hands would look like raw meat and I could hardly hang onto the bike. Now with these my hands are usually only slightly sore no ripped open skin. I spent 7 hours on my bike this weekend and not one blister on any part of my hands,without these my hands would be in bad shape. Well worth the money. Fit great under the gloves and do what they are supposed to. My only complaint is I didnt come up with the idea first.
B000CFDGO0|5|really stiffenss up the rear of the jeep, was a very nice addition to my vehicle,
B001GPZ300|5|Good quality real metal construction. A good way to show my Cubs pride after moving to a single plate state.
B004NBDLYE|5|perfect shower head, installed in about two minutes and works great, thank you  AAA+++
B003QJF12O|4|This alarm works well and gives you peace and mind that your bike will be safe so you don't have to worry about it<br />James
B00IKSM2Z0|5|I installed this rack on my 2003 GL1800.  Although it didn't come with installation directions, carefull measuring and placement before drilling the anchor holes through the trunk lid allowed for perfect placement.  I'm very satisfied with the rack and the way it looks on my Goldwing.
B009ANV81S|5|Very nicely made - will work just great for my stand-alone multi-step charger...
B000HBIB80|5|Great price for a high quality high temp silicone. Used to seal on an oil pan and it worked perfectly. I would buy this again.
B00295T4JW|4|This stuff is cool- prep your work by first cleaning with solvent, then a light primer coat of CLEAR primer and let it dry, can sand w/400-600 paper. Product is designed for CHROME, not polished aluminum.
B00HJCTJRW|4|This wasnt a perfect fit, but it covers 98% of the dash and looks very nice. The flap over the airbag isnt quite big enough.
B00K0TAY4S|5|Very happy excellent.
B001C4SL3G|5|My car is alive again! My transmission response as improved giving the car a like new feel! I would say its totally worth the investment. I cant comment on gas mileage because I am still enjoying the power gain.
B009682KIW|4|I bought for my boyfriends pickup and he loves it! Looks really good, very impressed! I would recommend to a friend for sure!
B00V50B90O|5|great product
B005HAYDR4|5|I researched these before I purchased them. I was not disappointed. They are sturdy, and easy to install. My kids wanted something in my Jeep to grap a hold of when we were climbing, and these fit the bill perfectly. Good Item.
B00APOBIAC|5|Looks Great came in fast Great product high quality. Highly recommend it.
B00IALCJNC|1|Very disappointed with this product. One of the Sunvisor's is so hard to open, l have to stop driving to open it. I am also afraid its going to break.
B003TKPR88|1|Works if needed but Cheap rubber mounts doesnt line up well, and doesnt change any hp as it claims , if anything more slack in the response of giving it gas
B008P5TAYY|3|Great gift for any Harley rider! The picture is somewhat deceiving. Actually, the logo is orange, but this product's logo is yellow.
B0002LBLAK|5|This is the best polish that I have ever used. Tried it on a white car and a charcoal gray car and excellent results! Couldn't be more pleased.
B003WLW4OE|5|fits well and works as expected.  As with any car door not a lot of room to put it in.
B00FVYQDD8|5|No complaints.
B00LMJDBGS|3|It fall easy!
B0006Z6XHS|2|This wash mitt WILL scratch your car. It is not nearly as soft as a pure lambswool or microfiber mitt.  I should have known when it stated polyester/nylon blend in addition to the wool (there must be only trace amounts of wool btw). You would never wash your car with a polyester/nylon shirt so don't do it with this mitt.  I would return it but it will cost me almost as much to return since it is only 4.88. Only good for washing the bottom of your car or your wheels. DO NOT USE IT ON CLEARCOAT! Save your money and get a pure lambswool or pure microfiber wash mitt or use a natural sponge. Those are superior.
B001OMVCTQ|4|OK, First of all, They do what they are supposed to do.  I have no problems with the product as of yet  ( I just finished installing them, so the jury is still out on longevity of the air bags).  Right now, my review is on the claimed &#34;1 hour or less&#34; install... BULLS**T!!!  I am a pretty savvy home mechanic/ light gearhead and this was not, I repeat NOT an easy1 hour, or 2 hour, or 4 EFin hour install.  This was a damn difficult install to say the least.  I say this only because it was not possible to install these without completely dismantling the rear end JUST to drill a hole in the bottom plate and run the hose through.  Maybe this would be easy on a small car, but not a Jeep. Getting the springs BACK in their seats was the biggest challenge, and in the process, I severed the air hose... TWICE!  If I wasn't such a cheap @$$ I would have taken to a shop and let them deal with it.  Maybe THEY could do it in less than an hour, but I seriously doubt it.  But I digress... there is a sense of accomplishment doing it yourself as well as a bit of trepidation hoping everything was put back together correctly ( I think I did it right as I do not have extra bolts left over).  The results were as expected- they inflated (no other leaks) and they added lift to the sagging rear end.  I will edit this review after I have hooked up my pop up camper and taken it down the road a few miles.  I expect that they will do what they were designed to do.  More Later....
B00EDOPCLQ|4|Worked as discribed.
B00CPSXPUW|5|Cool sticker. I love making fun of stick figure families and I love Star Wars. So what's not to love here? Arrived promptly and is just as good as any other vinyl sticker.
B000C9ISI0|5|I love factory parts,job went smooth as expected.
B000234IT4|5|So far so good.  It lifted the loaded truck which is what I wanted.  I hope it lasts.  I wish it traveled more distance.
B000C02LZU|4|Fit great. Easy to install on our 1999 Saturn SL-2. Very quiet. Only negative was the rubber boots shown in the picture were not in the box. I reused the old ones, but usually do anyways
B006GJYKWI|2|For the price of this product I'm not impressed. Not any better than armor all or meguiors and twice the price.
B000E4N3QU|5|Perfect fit.
B002GV3026|5|Worked and that is all you can ask. Do go to YouTube to get complete instructions on the installation. It is laborius, not strength based,  but saved me $230 doing it myself. And I am a 66 year old woman.
B0002T8FL0|5|No water required, this is great!  My custom bikes tend to have issues when water gets into the hand control area.  This cleaning kit eliminates this issue and works great!
B004K684A8|5|i use in a sublimator atomizer and it is great i didnt get them for an iolite and i couldnt be happier nice quality
B002OUMVWY|1|It leaks.  It leaks at both ends.  If there is one single thing a sewer hose should do is keep the sh*t in the hose.<br />I'm not going to return a hose that has been used so this is a write off.<br />In addition to leaking at both ends leaving the black water juice for me to clean out of my coach it also does not fit well in full hook up sited that have steep slopes to the sewer pipe.<br /><br />The elbow at the end is too short.  If you are at a site that needs the largest diameter of the adapter the hose is smashed into the ground if there is anything but a very gentle slope to the pipe.<br /><br />The connection from the elbow to the adapter is not standard so there seems to be no way to extend it so it fits.
B006X8AYQ8|4|not bad, looks like the picture once installed. The center billet grille i recieved was bent on the top but i was easily able to bend it back without any issues. I gave this product 4 stars because the instructions could have been much more detailed, i couldnt have seen an average customer without any car experience not having a difficult time installing this. Otherwise the Customer loved the look of his new grille.
B0071LIUI0|5|I purchased this decal for my car earlier this year and then my mom wanted one so I am a repeat customer.  HIghly recommend.  The decal is high quality and the color is beautiful.
B0060EJHQ8|5|Soft enough to flex in a crash but strong enough to always save your fingers.
B000LG41RQ|5|Installed on 1998 4Runner, Sound is great. Not too loud. Just a low exhaust note. Perfect for those who want to hear their vehicle but not blast you out. Does not give that droning resonating sound as others do. Perfect for SUV applications as these vehicles are hard to find a good exhaust for. Mileage and performance gains both improved. Well worth the modification.
B002R1MUBW|5|as advertised great price good shipping
B0007LEG2K|4|The Actron 9125 Pocketscan pays for itself after just one use. Just read the code, and you'll know exactly what is wrong with the auto. It was easy to use and saved me $$.
B00RW7WSQI|5|THEY CLEAN BETTER THAN THE NISSAN OEM BLADES. THEY MAKE LESS NOISE THAN THE OEM
B00EQ2G12O|5|I bought this last year and ended up laying my bike down while wearing it. I will say that it held up better than I had expected and was padded in all the right areas for a crash.  you DON'T need hard plastic protection as the D3O foam pads are designed to become ridged in an impact, something the guy who left the one star review doesn't seem to grasp. I would recommend this to everyone.
B00K7VE2VK|5|Drought restrictions prevent me from washing my car at home, so I decided to try a waterless car wash.  I initially tried it on the front bumper where I had quite a collection of bugs from a recent road trip.  Surprisingly, it removed the bugs and left a nice shine without scratching.  I tried the rear bumper with the same results.  Before I knew it, I had done the whole car in less time than it used to take with a bucket and mitt.  It left a nice shine and absolutely no scratching!  I will be buying again.  Follow up: After using this product for a year, I find I use it most often as a rinseless wash.  I fill a bucket, much like a regular car shampoo, and wash each panel with the mixture and then dry with a microfiber cloth.  I feel this way is less likely to scratch than just the spray & wipe, as you have more water to help float off the dirt.  However, I have not had it scratch as just the spray either.  Overall a very good product.
B005LSU1Y6|3|Extra row gives it more cooling, could not run more than 10-15 min on track but can run full sessions now. Quality is ok, the posts that sit in the mounts were different lengths (not supposed to be) and at different angles (again not supposed to be). The shroud clips were a little light but work ok. But no leaks so its doing its job.
B000P52IVE|2|Don't know who made the cover I got,  but the antenna pouch was sewn at the windshield seem not at the hatch seem. Talk about 'back ass wards'. Otherwise good product that fits and looks great
B001GKVZAM|5|Easy to install. Black looks just fine with the black cherry color of my car. Operates perfectly. I should've replaced my mirror sooner!
B0020SYY3O|4|This is as nice a gauge as I was expecting from the description. It seems to be well made and it feels sturdy enough to last for years. As others have stated, the lack of a pressure release valve is unfortunate but I was not expecting it to have one.<br /><br />In my opinion it has one fault that took me by surprise. The black rubber shock absorber around the gauge stinks with a powerful rubber aroma. When I opened the packaging I was immediately irritated by the smell. I'm knocking it down one star for this. Some people are very sensitive to chemical smells like this and I just want to alert them to this problem. After handling this gauge you will want to wash your hands because that smell transfers to the hands.<br /><br />I understand that this will not pose a problem for many folks, but I find the odor, even at arm's length, very offensive. Hopefully the smell will fade after a few weeks. Until then, this gauge will stay outdoors.
B000C8T7X6|5|Way superior to the Dorman equivalent. Thicker plastic and completely flat, which the Dorman I had clearly was not. I used the Fel-Pro gasket with this plenum instead of the one that came with it since I never want to do this job again so I decided to use the best available parts. The Dorman plenum gasket sucked and leaked antifreeze after only having been in service for 9 months. I hate looking at leaked antifreeze. I'm confident the ATP plenum and the Fel-Pro gasket will accomplish what the Dorman could not. This does appear to be a very high quality part.
B0032EZG7I|3|Bought them, but when I mocked them up, didn't like. I thought about cutting them in half, but wound up only using maybe 3 feel of each for two strips on my hood. The vinyl is great and adhears great, but the original design was too much. I like simple.
B00AX19UMU|4|Still installation & testing. Will feed back later
B00BVL7W1C|5|Exactly as ordered and came in fast...<br /><br />This worked well and protected my Rims<br /><br />They are also very light weight so I can carry on my motorcycle<br /><br />Thanks
B001RLKX0S|1|Rusted through.... not the best quality.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  the company would not accept a return even though the product rusted after only 2 1/2 years
B00G8UNQQ6|5|Nice HID kit
B00K0TCT00|5|They provide great coverage. You cannot leave the factory mats in though.
B0068ODC1Q|5|Exactly as advertised. Working perfectly. Great price.<br />Thank you
B00KB76DEY|5|Keeps the car clean. No dog fur stuck to the car upholstery. Fit great.
B004AGC7OM|4|These rotors are very good.  My 2007 Passat brake job included rotors and pads from bosch (front and rear) and they work very well.  But what can you say about rotors?  Well, the fit for the rear rotors is good, although, the diameter of these rotors are a little larger than the originals by about 1/4 inch (or less).  Apparently, it's common for non OEM rotors to be this slightly larger size, but it does not affect performance at all.  It's not a deal breaker because they work, but I wish they were the exact same size as the originals.  Oh well, I have no real complaint here.  I do think they are heavier than the original rotors, but you don't realize that until after they are installed. In other words, it's a moot point and too late to do anything about them being &#34;heavier&#34; than the originals.  They are smooth and, combined with the bosch brake pads, provide excellent stopping power.  I am happy with the quality of the rotors and do recommend them for anyone interested in replacement rotors.
B001TQ5ZS6|5|This is the absolute best folding chair we have EVER had!  this has a large comfortable seat and folds up easily. Am ordering another one right now.  Hope it holds up well as it is very comfortable and we plan on having them for a long, long time.
B00594BIY4|1|This water hose had 2 tiny holes in the female connector and did nothing but leak. I won't buy a water hose online again.
B000CQBNJY|5|I love the Screen Filter it catches a lot of dirt that would go into the Gas Tank. And The Funnel is easy to handle.
B000COYKR8|5|You will need to have different weights to do the job , so I reccomend you get a selection and do the job correctly.
B00029KC2K|5|This stuff is great. It's expensive but it's great. We used it underneath a plastic engine cover in an rv and the difference is definitely noticeable. It's much quieter in the cab and the area around the cover is much cooler. Driving barefoot used to be impossible and now I barely feel a little warmth even if my feet touch the cover. It has a very, very strong adhesive and you'll definitely notice the difference. I'm very satisfied with the product.
B00GSAUHB8|3|Very thin and hard to make it stay on the windshield
B008BOG0PG|5|Far as I can tell this oil is doing the job. No oil leakage mess on the boxes I received. Two cases arrived well packaged and clean.
B000HI9E7U|5|I bought these to use when adjusting the valves of my 2007 Honda Fit Sport. These made the job very fast and easy as it took out the guesswork when checking clearances.
B00252G8PC|5|fit is prefect,price is decent, quality is great,and best of all,purchased in the comfort of home..free shipping..Can't beat that..
B000N5OGTI|5|Good quality.  Good fit.
B00B2YE4B4|5|I put these in a 2000 Dodge Durango and a 1992 S10, compared to incandescent bulbs these LEDs are like having a mini sun in the S10. The incandescent bulbs actually melted the light fixture in the S10 so these help a lot with that. They are also much brighter than the old bulbs in the Durango, I can actually see in there at night now.
B0007N1ZPY|5|Buy it, read the back and pass the test.
B00120IEF0|4|perfect fit, well constructed, the clear paint protector film is a plus, fairly easy to install, keep in mind that when installing a set on the rear, you may have to remove tires to drill pilot holes.
B001JT342M|4|A nice pad folio, but wish the cardboard were a little stronger<br /> Overall, fine, does the job and looks professional
B000SNBSMI|5|I have an HD FLHTI, and it fit great! Easy to install and plenty of room for airflow, its constructed material is better than most I have seen in dealerships. I would recommend this cover to anyone, great price for a Motorcycle cover of this quality.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Matt
B00CHDO0M2|4|The product was deliveredon time and fits perfect...I'll recommend this seller....Pleased.!
B00SVEQPRE|5|This is Awesome and a small sample was sent with it ,too!!!
B00AQ29DJG|5|Good value hubcabs. Easy to put on. Looks a bit like others for my car.<br />Not a heavy gauge material but good for the price.
B00COYNVKQ|5|Best mats i've bought!! and good quality too. Its been a year and they still look great.
B00030DLEE|4|The Item I got doesnt look like the picture they show. But I was still satisfied with the design and operation of the lunchbox I recieved. plenty of cord....easy access fuse...easy clean-up and portable. The lunchbox worked as advertised...
B00IYUJC3O|1|The item came apart with in 4 hours of wear.<br />The frog that holds the sword pulled off the rivets of the baldric. (pic below)<br />I did not do anything to it but wear it around the TX Ren Fair.<br />And Amazon is unable to process a return due to special handling of the item.<br />At least it was not expensive.
B003CJM8HO|5|great tuner easy to use direct plug & play unlike dakota digital
B00BWU6Z5Q|2|When applying, some of the letters ripped or wouldn't stick. I had to throw away most of the product. I kept the compass part.
B002YKNWTU|5|Works in conjunction with OTC's C-Press and forcing screw.
B00BT1PZZE|1|these seat covers are NOTHING like the picture.<br />the material was cheaply put together<br />they do not fit properly and are all wrinkled<br />the color also isnt the same as the picture its actually not even the same product at all<br />hated them and sent them back
B000IYSKQ4|3|The motor is sized the same as.the original but the bolt holes are smaller... I was in a pinch so I had to drill and tap to get the original bolts to fit. Amazon led me to believe it was a direct replacement.
B000SNBSMI|5|Perfect cover the right size for my Kawasaki Vulcan 2000, very good quality .....I keep the bike in my garage is just to protect from dust.
B001PIDNBY|4|Great soft leather - should come in a smaller size for sports car glove boxes
B00G3BRNVY|5|Use the oil religiously now in my 2001 Ford Focus SE 2.0 with 148,000mis. I previously used regular Pennzoil Platinum 5w20 which is an incredible motor oil itself (according to oil analysis / BITOG.com) successfully but felt as my Focus is up in age (13yrs old and runs strong!) a high mileage reformulated oil with seal conditioners & special additives was better way to go. So far after 3 oil changes with this Royal Purple HMX car purrs and idles smoothly. I run 7500mis between changes. Car doesnt burn or leak a drop of oil.
B00HF3N8N6|5|Good quality light bar. Bright and clear. First flash pattern is the best one. For the price I am extremely satisfied. I have purchased 2 of these.
B006B7YJ2Q|5|I have purchased a K&N air filter in every car I've owned and I've always been impressed. About a month a half ago I purchased a 2012 Honda Civic. Of course, it had the standard air filter installed. I have a bit of a lead foot and only averaged about 25 MPG in my first few fill-ups. I tried using ECON mode, and it does help, but it makes the car less responsive. Last week I installed the K&N filter and I've already noticed a remarkable improvement in fuel economy and responsiveness. I have averaged 32 MPG so far, but at times it goes up to 35 MPG around town. I still don't use ECON mode, because I don't want to sacrifice power for economy, but I don't need to, since I'm still seeing an improvement after simply installing the new filter. As far as responsiveness improvements go, I can definitely not only feel an increase in power, especially low-end, but the engine even sounds meaner, especially at full throttle.  Update: I've had the filter installed for a bit longer now and I'm now averaging 35 MPG. It has never dipped below that and I've reset the trip odometer, which forces it to recalculate fuel millage. I'm very happy. I'm getting 10 MPG better fuel millage with no change other than the filter.
B0051RI0BI|5|well you could spent a lot more and maybe ..just maybe it would be better.but for the price you cant go wrong easy to install and sounds good as well..no drone I can speak of!
B0015DOEKI|5|AAA GREAT Product
B000KL39BG|5|Best floor liners ever!  Fit is amazing and they trap dirt and liquid and keep it from getting to the carpet.
B002YCE5V2|5|I had \\"service 4WD\\" light on for months and after reading several posts that it could just be a bad switch.<br />I decided to purchase one to try it out.  This fixed my problem.
B00G9554PQ|5|decent product
B003Z9YKRM|5|This cover is very easy to install and/or remove if needed, takes just a couple of minutes to install it, just make sure you align it properly, don't tighten it completely when you first sit the back part down because chances are you might need to adjust it a bit. I've had my cover for about a year now, travelled with it to Michigan and Florida from Texas and has held up very well even in the rain. I recommend this item to anyone looking for a bed cover, IMO, it looks better than the large hard covers that sell for over 1k. Cheers!
B00F0VMMSW|5|Good
B0036GP9QA|4|These came with my 2008 Scott Sub 20 bike and served me well for 5 years and several thousand miles. The rubber does not rubber off and there is no chemical smell.
B004BTODWW|5|As described and shipped quick!
B000EVWDAK|5|Just purchased a diagnostic scanner. I'm from the old school and swore that I would never ever try and diagnose these newer cars, but I have bit the bullet and on my way to learn how, There is also a team of ASE tech's that have a way to join them to help you, I will update you more as I get the hang of it.
B00062ZMTQ|5|I installed this filter on my Range Rover, accelerator responds now much quicker . I can feel as engine briefs better - much better .<br />Will recomend it to everyone who has 2003 3.0 Range Rover Vogue Turbo Diesel.<br />VERY GOOD product !! Thank K&N very much. It really does a job .
B000WJX4BQ|5|Available locally charged and ready to go but for $20.00 more.  I waited 2 days, installed the acid myself per the included instructions, put it on slow charge overnight, installed the battery, started the bike up and haven't looked back.  That extra $20 can buy alot of stuff.
B00K7JK9QE|4|I wish it gave a better description of the sticker size.. Bought these for my wife's helmet to cover the helmet logo and they are to small.. The two stickers on the left and right are about the size of a quarter.. The center sticker is a decent size maybe 5&#34; in length and 2.5 in height
B0028FW9K4|5|Best product since sliced bread (I just made that up). Very handy and very strong. Heavy and stout constructions. Puts the ball about 7\\" further from the electric socket, so you made need an extension for the trailer electrics. This is a real time saver. If you just get close to the hitch, the ball can be moved to hook-up. Highly recommend you lock it on to prevent theft.
B00FEONHHA|5|very good
B00E5OUOCQ|4|I got this for my son's car.  He has a midsize VW and it fit really well.  We live in a very hot area and being able to use a front shade makes a huge difference the next time we get in the cars.  Happy with this purchase!
B000C9QTCW|1|does not fit an 04 chevrolet impala, base model
B00PHWQW7Q|5|veddy niiiice
B00CG5ROFQ|5|Everything is fine
B003V9W0G4|5|loved my tire patches they work great
B00ZJICU5G|5|perfect tool for my job at hand / pretty heavy duty,made short work of a other wise big job.
B004AIGB4W|4|I was unsure of what I had gotten myself into when I chose to fix my own power window rather than pay somebody else hundreds of dollars to do. Well the repair was easy and quick. The part fit great but it does not come with the three nuts needed to secure the motor. They are a cheap easy to get part but made the project take an extra day until I went to the hardware store. The motor is also slower than the remaining factory ones. If it included the three five cent nuts I would have given it five stars. By the way those nuts that were needed are M6-1.00 in case you want to have them on hand ahead of time. 1/4\\"-28 (fine thread) will fit also but the metric ones felt tighter on the threads.
B0041TTXC2|4|Perfect fit.  No problems.  Good value.
B00IZLFF10|5|This thig is bad ass
B0089NV7GQ|1|Good price very poor choice of material, mine didn't last 2 months, IMO I would not recommend this product for anything other than a bicycle.
B0000AY3SR|4|I bought this product with the intention of using it on the tail lights of a vintage car which had become dull from exposure to the sun and elements.  I've used other Meguire's products in the past on my cars and had good results plus this product was reasonably priced so I thought I'd give it a shot.  A little goes a long way, just put a small amount on a soft clean cloth, the manufacturer recommends a micro fiber towel or terry cloth.  Then just buff the plastic with it, I used two applications, but one seemed to work fine, it didn't get too much clearer with the second one.  I did notice that it gets a little hard to remove when it gets drier, so wipe it off before then.  Also, after I was finished, I did notice that there were still some very tiny dots stuck to the plastic, sort of like what you'd see on a car that doesn't get cleaned and waxed enough.  Not a big deal at all, they are not really noticeable unless you really look for them.  Not sure if further buffing would have removed them, but didn't think it was worth the extra effort, as I said, not really noticeable at all.<br /><br />In a second trial I used this stuff on some solar lights in my garden.  Again the plastic panels on the lights had become dull from exposure, but unlike the car, these were severely dulled to the point where you could barely see the little wires under the plastic.  I did three passes with this stuff, although again, most of the progress was made in the first pass.  The end result was decent, the little panels looked much clearer than before although no where near as clear as new.  Not sure if further buffing would get it any clearer or if those things are just too far gone (and not the greatest quality to begin with).  There is a dull sheen to the panels now, where as when new they were very glossy and clear, but some of the yellowing seems to be gone and you can see the wires underneath quite clearly now.  Maybe if they'd been polished at an earlier stage of damage they would have ended up better now.<br /><br />To conclude, I'd say that this is a good product, it performed well.  I was hoping it would work a little better on the solar panels, but as I said those are cheap quality plastic so it's to be expected.  This product is probably best suited to light to medium damage and dullness, not severe. Didn't compare it to any other product so not sure if it's the best, but worked well enough for me.  If you don't have any plastic polish this is a good one to add to your box of cleaners as it's proven to me that it's good for shining up just about any dull plastic not just headlights.have ended up better now.<br /><br />To conclude, I'd say that this is a good product, it performed well.

B006A1PGDE|4|In most cars, the car has to be running for the 12v socket to work which kind of defeats the purpose of this. I get to work early on Mondays and take a nap in my car before starting. I use it all the time so I have to restart my car to warm it up periodically. I guess this would be good if you were stuck somewhere and your car still ran. Wish I could find a battery operated one of these. Anyone know if they even make them?
B0009IBJAS|5|the charger was a great value and we have a few, seems to be working fine, starts up the shelby right away trickle the battery all winter and it is nice to go out 1 time a month and click the switch and hear the roar of the engine.
B007BE4W5C|4|I like this cover.  It appears to be made out of the same material as the soft top with the same foam padding lining the inside as the original roll bar cover has.  Since my soft top vinyl hasn't faded I'm hoping this will be the last cover I need to buy.  If you don't want to mess with trying to restore the dark color to your original roll bar covers using the black Krylon fabric spray paint, this is the way to go.  The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars: 1) a bit tight, had some difficulty getting the front pieces to match up to the rear piece (attach to one another with velcro).  2) pretty much follows the exact same pattern as the original; as you know the zipper fabric fades horribly on the original since it's on top facing the sun, so I fear that after a few years it will fade and be a light stripe against the dark vinyl. Would like to see it relocated to the bottom or inside of the roll bar to prevent this (or switch to a velcro strip instead)  3) waterproof (made out of same material as the soft top) -- could be a pain if rained on or water somehow gets in on the ends or soft top hardware cutouts because you would probably have to take them off or at the very least unzip to let the moisture back out.  I'd like to see Rugged Ridge design a vinyl cover like this using velcro instead of zippers and larger diameter but using a thicker layer of foam padding inside (to give you more adjustability) rather than trying to make it so form fitting.  But in my opinion, this one is better than the original.  I'll update this post if I see any problems over time.  Any questions or to see how it's held up over time (installed 8/14/13) feel free to e-mail me at jaredsemail-at-yahoo-dot-com.<br /><br />7/24/14 update -- no issues -- no fading (even the zippers) so far.  I'm quite happy with this purchase.  Definitely go vinyl if you replace your roll bar covers.
B0015S7T5K|1|I ordered these together with the rotors to fit our 1998 Mazda Protege . The parts arrived on time and we duly dismantled the vehicle The rotors fitted perfectly but the brake pads were some half inch over sized. Consequently they fouled the center of the rotors. Not worth the hassle of returning so consigned them to the rubblish and purchased a replacement set from the local shop - which fitted perfectly. I have rechecked on Amazon and it still states that these are suitable for the Protege.<br />Not impressed obviously
B0041P1SLU|4|NICE!
B002UZSO3S|5|Oh! when you add these you can really turn some things on!
B00F7NLOZA|5|The shield is installed and removed with great ease, just flick one lever and off comes the shield from the helmet.  Also, peripheral vision is very wide so this makes it safe to look left and right before lane changes.  No view blocking effect here at all.  I use the clear shield.  I used to use the silver mirror sheilds, but not anymore.  They work, but they scratch easily which totally ruins the shield.  Just use the clear shield and install the HJC brand dark smoke inner shield.  This way you can ride in the day with the dark smoke shield and ride at night with only the clear shield.  No need to stop and change shields anymore due to changing low light levels.  JamesRussellPublishing.biz
B00KGKI9JS|5|Great little charger and well worth the price.  Self contained, built-in diagnostics, and rugged cables make it robust yet portable and simple to use.
B0009IBJAS|5|Got 2 to hold batteries over winter for a car and a mower rather than taking then into house. Seems to be doing a good job so far. Like the options for connecting to a battery.
B000GTVOGY|5|Got this (along with a 4 carb sycronizer and auxiliary fuel tank) because hubby purchased an 82 Honda CB750 basket case.  The tool works exactly as it should as do the other items I purchased!  All items arrived in record time! And all in excellent condition!  Another great day with Amazon!
B00GA9WR3S|5|5 stars ! Amazing !  I use the megahitch as a deterrent to theft on the tiny house on wheels that I'm building ! The farther along I got into the construction, the more concerned I got regarding the possibility of theft and all my creative and hard work just disappearing. This lock is an absolute fortress ! The quality, for once,  is comparable to the price I paid for it. Pricey, especially when compared to other lock types out there. !  But, how much more valuable the property I'm protecting ! What a peace of mind it's given.  Now, I know that &#34;where there is a will, there is a way&#34;, this in regards to stealing or people creating other ways to make someone's life miserable. Im not naive. But, trust me in this ! This lock is the real deal: easy to apply, good to look at, and sturdy as &#34;all get out&#34;. My due diligence included looking at the comparison reviews on YouTube at how every other hitch lock is easily bypassed or destroyed. This has definitely been one purchase I've made without regret. In this situation, excellent quality is so worth the price you pay for it ! Hope that helps in your decision.
B005NLQAHS|5|This little blue tooth gem has already helped me diagnose several friends cars, saving them trips to the dealer. This tool combined with the app Torque have saved my friends a lot of money already. I was able to diagnose several different problems, show them how to fix the problems and turn off the no longer needed check engine light. This tool is a good bargain.
B00ARUQ4JE|5|Great Item!
B001AM8J14|5|Fit my 2000 Towncar perfect! Ride height increased to when new. Nice firm controled ride.
B000A3FZP2|5|It's racin' man! I wish I could have bought a plain steering wheel cover that fit the odd sized ranger steering wheel, but the couple i bought at the local auto parts store didn't fit well.  This one is very tight to get on the steering wheel, but once you manage to get it on there doesn't move or shift around and adds some thickness which really makes the truck more comfortable to drive.
B002KMBJBA|5|Fit my 2006 X3 perfectly!
B00CAEV418|5|This window decal changed my opinion on bumper stickers.
B000BZ537E|5|Bearing was identical to bearing removed from 2000 saturn sl1. Bearing was stamped NSK. Made in USA and a great value!
B004GE0MCW|5|Shipped and arrived quickly. Fit perfectly into place as though it were the original part. Would totally use product again but hope to keep the keys from my brother so I dont.
B00D9W4JNK|5|Fluid has a limited shelf life after opening the container, so if you don't need to bleed more than one or two sets of bicycle brakes, go for a smaller bottle to end up with less waste.
B000GKAZM2|4|Not as white a light as I hoped but they really light up the road farther ahead, especially the road signs, they jump to life and look like they are super lit neon. Great option over those very costly Xenon conversions. I highly recommend these, I'm very pleased, they were quick and very easy to replace too. I put them in my 2011 Kia Optima high beams.
B001O074JU|5|My mechanic installed these new coils in my truck in less than two hours and I am extremely happy with the end result. This is the first time I have used Accel products but I can tell you if I am looking for reasonably priced &#34;performance&#34; products in the future Accel is my brand of choice. Just as a side note, I improved my exhaust system with larger pipes and Flowmaster mufflers which in the end showed the weakness of my factory coils. More air was going through the system and the old factory coils just couldn't handle the improvement. Then again, at 115,000 miles, I was not upset. I figured I had gotten my money's worth out of them and decided to install the Accel coils. I am extremely glad I did.
B000CPAW2O|5|I studied many tailpipe extenders and this one adds a touch of class to my 2006 Chrysler Sebring GTC convertible. It took about 5minutes to install, and stands out from the rear bumper.  It a beauty and adds a nice finishing touch! All I needed was a small wrench to install it.
B00PTFJN2W|5|Everything works perfect, dealer was able to program without any issues
B004X5O6SK|5|It worked out well, though had to take to a shop to remove the stuck old part. No issues with this new part.
B002E5HMWI|5|I got exactly what I needed. Great buy.
B000CINVA6|5|This is great grease. I like to use it especially on areas that will be exposed to moisture as it holds up really well. It also stays on for a longer period than other spray on lubricants I have used. All in all it is my go to grease to apply on areas that require it.
B0031BL0W2|5|Great sound!! I've had this 2 into 1 exhaust for a while now and all I can say is that it definitely changes the attitude of your Sportster.
B00HM9V3X0|4|I installed these into my reverse lights on my Lexus CT200h and they work flawlessly. I have my whole car outfitted with LED's and I went with these as they also have the bottom on side LED's, they are very unique. I thought about putting them into my license plate lights that already have LED lights in them but these run alittle long the the top LED's alittle crammped therefore blocks most of the emitting light. I only give 4 stars as they are pricey for what they are, what else can you expect from iJDMTOY? These are no different in quality than any other ebay and Amazon brand that charges 10-20% of the price. I only purchased these as they appear to be one of a kind.
B002INP6QU|1|Should have listened to the other negative reviews.  Very cheap materials and difficult to use.  1st use, the pin at end the crank bent.  Even though it was cheap, you did not get what you pay for.
B0002SQYSM|5|I read some of the reviews and thought that this device could not be that good. However, I thought I had a faulty injector and could not figure out how to \\"hear\\" it working as the manual suggested, so I decided to give it a try.    I can not believe how well this device works. I used it on the injectors (all were fine; you can hear the clicking). The device works by placing it directly on the source with the tip. I initially thought you held it near the device in question. That will not work. The end of the device transmits vibrations to your ears.    I have since used the device around the house and in other cars to find squeaks and rattles. I also used it to determine that my water was not completely shutting off. I simply placed it on the main water pipe and turned the main valve on and off. Without the stethoscope I could not tell if the water was on or off, but with the device it was readily apparent.
B00M5WYWPU|1|The &#34;P&#34; isn't the correct size.
B00AHJZBCG|5|So far, this light has performed well.  Charged it completely upon receipt, have used several times without issue.  This thing is BRIGHT.  This isn't your father's 2D cell flashlight.  The dual setting, bright and very bright, comes in handy.  Easy to use, feels good in the hand.  Not too heavy and well balanced.  No complaints.
B000CO86BY|3|does the job, though the worksmanship is mediocre - the stamping is such that my two are slightly different shapes, because the base plates were folded at different angles
B00AQG7WW2|2|Light bulb only flashed. The tail light function did NOT work. I purchased these as a replacement to my 1157 and these bulbs barely fit correctly. One may need to modify bulb or socket for correct fit
B001JT5IQ2|5|Bought this for my husband who travels many miles each day.  He has lower back issues and tells me this works great.
B00BECJ2SO|4|These are not constructed as heavy as the straps they replaced, but they work fine.  Not crazy about the color, but they are easy to locate.
B000TFRIRO|5|excellent product, on time
B00U0UWPAS|5|Great quality for the price. Can't complain!
B0027XY5JA|5|ok
B000EVYGZA|5|Lots of different settings that I really know nothing about.  EXCEPT AC and that's really the only one I need it for.  I'm still alive to write this review, so it must work pretty good, huh?!
B00R2W84SO|3|I bought this tool with the intention of being able to read the Ford service codes.  For those of you who are familiar with these, they can be anything from a loose wire to a transmission problem.  From what I have read, the ford dealers get upwards of $100 to read the codes.  I didn't like the idea of spending that kind of money to be told that I only needed an oil change.<br />At first, I thought this scanner would be capable of reading the service codes, but it is not.  It seems to be able to reach beyond the &#34;check engine light&#34; codes,  and I hope to utilize those functions.  It  was able to pick up a general code for a problem with my passenger seat as it related to the seat belt, However, it was not able identify the specific PID so I din't know if it was just a loose wire or a defective module.  My only other scanning tool links to my laptop, so by far, this scanner is easier to use.  Readers who need the ABS functions may find the price okay.  I purchased the tool for a specific purpose, so it turned out not to be a good investment.<br />To the tool's credit, it did function as advertised.
B0002KPY2M|5|Works perfectly, very convenient, and reasonable. being magnetic is the best! I leave it next to my metal tool box for easy access.
B00CPGQ2DG|4|seems to work fine . need to see how it works on a hot day and pavement
B00C1QAIHG|3|Disappointed,  item as depicted looks clearer and sharper.  However will give it a trial as we don't have many Peruvian Paso advertising products in Australia. Hot weather here will be good test<br />C.Alford Gidge WA.
B000MLF7CS|4|Simple and provides basic codes.  A useful tool.
B000JZHAIG|5|Before I purchase a product I do extensive research on it, maybe about 8-9 hours of searching and comparing products on different websites. I compare the potential increase in horsepower, price, and style. I saw a bunch of electric based, but many of the reviews showed that after a few months of usage they'd break down and shortly after so would the performance. I know K&N makes awesome products, but this time they did an outstanding job. I'm 100% positive it works, because every time I press on the gas you can hear a sucking sound from the K&N filter, it sounds like when you have a vacuum on and you place you hand over it slightly letting some air in, I'm assuming that's exactly what it's doing to my engine by letting an so much air in. Oh, and on a last note, my truck HAULS A** NOW. (note: I also installed MBRP exhaust and an airaid to the throttle body)
B003AOFRRY|5|That was quick and easy
B000C5YCZ2|5|Did the trick!
B001E74NE2|5|Very good I am satisfied
B002N4PYDE|1|I brought this wiper blade for my wife's 2002 jeep liberty.  I've installed many wiper blades in my life and never had an issue with any.  Install on this one was simple.  A few days later, my wife turned on wiper while going 45mph down the road and off it came.<br /><br />Time to order a different one.
B0009PSA4O|5|Very nice product, well made, quality mounting hardware.
B005BSU0WY|1|The product broke after 5 min<br />The plastic screw broke off
B001AZUAQS|4|I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law who is a Jeep lover. He liked it.
B0006IX7WY|5|These are great for my travel trailer refrigerator!
B001KSGF14|4|Works great,  4 stars due to price.<br />Ps good luck getting the old one out.  Took several short words to work mine free.
B00BZFZ68K|5|This is an easy one shot cover for my GTI. Goes on easy PUTTING it on by myself. My car stays clean now . Thank you
B00162QGP4|5|Sticks to brush, seems to have left the bore very smooth, removed excess without going to steel. Just started cleaning my guns with it.
B000CO9U7I|5|Great air intake for my 2001 Nissan Frontier (Supercharged V6). A small noticeable power gain when installed, but the real great thing about it is the little added noises it makes. You can hear your engine &#34;breathing&#34; at low rpm's, and even the supercharger is a bit louder. Easy installation process as well, it only took me about 45 minutes to install.
B004I0YNMO|5|This replacement tail light is a perfect fit for my 2006 Odyssey and looks perfect.  It doesn't include the bulbs.  By the way, To replace this item on a 2006 Odyssey is a chore requiring removal of all of the interior door paneling.
B00480BWA0|5|This little device works perfectly and I've saved a lot of money reloading my own cylinders. They key - as others have mentioned here - is to place the 1lb cylinders in the freezer prior to filling. That seems to get them about as full as they are off the shelf. Any fuller and you could have problems if they sit in the sun, or get too hot. I found this out the hard way. After freezing, filling, refreezing and filling a second time, the canister was completely full. The next day at camp, they started leaking from the safety vent as they began to warm up. So note to self, leave some room for expansion.
B000Y89L0S|5|Good product, does was it was intended to do. You won't be disappointed with these bearing protectors. Reasonable price and they are easy to install.
B008EEYTRE|5|Good quality kit.  Nice OE quality Aisin pump.  Tensioner was also OE Aisin.  Idler & tensioner puller were Koyo.  Belt was Mitsuboshi.  Good for another 105K without any worries.
B004ETGQKG|5|I love the car snow cover!  I've order 5 of them and given them to friends whose cars sit out in all weather.  Ice and snow are easily removed when I remove the cover.  It also stays in place very well even when windy.  It's a great time saver!  I use on on the windshield and the back window of my car.
B000GZGQHU|4|The shocks and provided accessories look to be of good quality. My '03 Yukon XL no longer feels like a boat on choppy waters. The directions are lacking but there's lots of video tutorials out there.<br /><br />On the down side, they shipped two different colors - one gray and one white. Not a deal breaker as you can barely see them behind my tires.
B0006U2BI8|1|I recently purchased a Deltran Battery Tender Plus (they are made in China) battery charger for a total cost of $63.30. It has never worked correctly from the first day I got it. It charges great, but it never goes into the \\"storage\\" mode, or notifies you that the battery is at 80% charged. It apparently just keeps charging the battery whether it needs it or not.<br /><br />I contacted Deltran's \\"technical\\" department a few times about the problem, and told them that I suspected the charger was faulty, but they kept telling me it was the battery, or \\"check this\\" or \\"check that\\" or \\"the weather was too cold\\" (in Florida), even though I had told them the battery was new. So, figuring they knew what they were talking about, I purchased another brand new battery at the cost of $79.92.<br /><br />I left the \\"new\\" battery on this charger for a few days, and it was the same thing as the \\"old\\" battery. The charger never showed a full charge or went into storage mode.<br /><br />So now that the equipment that this battery is from has been out of service for a couple of weeks, (because Deltran recommended I remove the battery from the equipment since I was having a problem charging it), and I couldn't afford to fiddle around any longer, I bought a competitors battery charger for $46.45, and as it turns out after connecting the new charger, within a matter of a few minutes both the \\"old\\" and the \\"new\\" batteries showed fully charged, and the new (competitors) charger went into \\"storage\\" mode with no problem.<br /><br />Now that I knew for sure that this Deltran Battery Tender Plus charger was not working properly, I reviewed the Battery Tender Plus \\"LIMITED\\" 10 year warranty, and found out they (Deltran) wants a $9.95 \\"handling\\" fee (if you have had the charger over 90 days), and if you have the original sales receipt, if you want to send it in for repair.<br /><br />If you don't have the original receipt, then it is a $15.95 \\"handling\\" fee no matter how long you have had it.<br /><br />Having wasted about 2- weeks fiddling with 2- different batteries and 2- different chargers all because the Deltran Battery Tender Plus did not work correctly in the first place, I am not about to spend another $15.95 \\"handling\\" fee (because I don't have the original receipt) plus shipping (maybe $10.00) to return it to Deltran for exchange/repair, and then wait another week or two to get the charger back and have to hope that it now works correctly.<br /><br />Deltran also told me that since I did not buy the Battery Tender Plus in question directly from them, I would need to send it back to where I originally purchased it. Not having the original receipt (because I bought it someplace online and don't remember where), I asked Deltran what's the difference where I purchased it since they (Deltran) are the manufacturer and supply the warranty as well, and I was told that \\"it is the same as trying to return a Chevrolet to a Ford dealership\\". That I don't understand, because if a person has a problem with a Chevrolet, they can take it to any Chevy dealer in the country and have it fixed (and maybe any GM dealer).<br /><br />They also said in so many words that I should have known sooner that the charger was defective, which must mean that their \\"technical\\" department is not fully competent to be advising anyone, and that I should have not paid any attention to their suggested remedies in the first place.<br /><br />Because of the investment of time and money I now have in this Battery Tender Plus, and the poor \\"technical\\" support I received from Deltran, I would never buy another one and would not recommend it to anyone else. Their 10 year \\"LIMITED\\" warranty is also a joke. Battery Tender PlusSucks! It should be called Battery Tender Negative!.e had it.  <br /> <br />Having wasted about 2- weeks fiddling with 2- different batteries and 2- different chargers all because the Deltran Battery Tender Plus did not work correctly in the first place, I am not about to spend another $15.95 \\"handling\\" fee (because I don't have the original receipt) plus shipping (maybe $10.00) to return it to Deltran for exchange/repair, and then wait another week or two to get the charger back and have to hope that it now works correctly. <br /> <br />Deltran also told me that since I did not buy the Battery Tender Plus in question directly from them, I would need to send it back to where I originally purchased it.

B0086RQ5BM|3|It's smaller then I thought it would be.
B000B8JU98|3|Fit the radiator I ordered it for
B0091ZP10Y|5|Great quality build, the button feels sturdy and well built.  In addition it works with both NC and NO.
B00BZ9EHFO|2|2 of the 3 gauges worked, sent the other one in, then they blamed me for why it isnt working and told me they wouldnt fix it.  Then they wanted me to spend another 10 bucks to send the non working gauge back to me. No thanks.
B00A7PSSW0|2|I have receive two cover that does not fit my car !!!!<br /><br />Although I have send a picture of my car bumper, and I was mailed back that the item will fit my car, that was not the result!!!<br /><br />I replied via email twice and as per today I have not receive any answer!<br /><br />I wanted to know if it is possible to make the cover , based on a piece of a front bumper of my car model!<br /><br />thank you in advance!
B000JZCZF4|4|Great Item and came VERY fast THANK YOU  for that =D<br />The plug was not the correct one in reason as to why it was only given 4 stars rather than 5. I had to cut both 02 sensor wires (new/old) a and solder them together to make it work. But other than my extensive labor on it. the item work like a charm!
B008GB63EW|4|This made my girlfriend laugh for like 5 mins! I love it! My only gripe is the V in the Vtec is a lower case v and it doesn't look right lower case
B000NKCIXE|5|Its lifetime, suppose to increase a little more horsepower and save on gas. Little maintenance and I usually cleaned it 25,000 miles.<br />It does fit perfect on my corolla 2012.
B000BM8RT8|4|I just returned from a trip to S.D. where I used this item for the first time, other than just making sure it ran. It worked well and was surprisingly fast at airing a low tire up. The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was that the pressure gauge fogged up, preventing me from using it. However that was not an insufferable loss as I always check pressure with a hand held air gauge that I trust. Other than the fogging, it gets a thumbs up from me.
B004HCU77I|5|Great value ,nice way to start your car wash items add 5 gallon buckets and Grit guard inserts and you are ready to go
B00D6DOFTK|1|Didn't work, beware!
B00OPMIR2M|4|ok
B007Y5745S|5|My husband and I and both of our adult children have these sun shades or our vehicles, 2 trucks, 1 SUV, and 1 car. They all fit perfectly so I bought this one for my mother's car. It fits perfectly, too.
B005345DBY|5|Love this thing.  Fits well and helps keeps cold out. Only area that it fails to protect is the neck in my opinion. I love it though made winters a lot more tolerable
B0002NIKVG|5|This keychain is adorable.  What I especially like about this is the blue border surrounding the red entire shape.  Other Superman key chains don't have the blue border and the blue border makes the other colors pop.  It is made out of sturdy flexible plastic.  I think it is durable.  You can use it as a keychain or put it on a zipper as a pull.  If Batman drops the ball and you decide to change your Superhero to Superman you'll love this adorable little trinket.  It is a nice size not too huge fits nicely on your key ring.  I purchased two and my &#34;Superman&#34; and I both use ours as key chains. It got a chuckle out of it and immediately put it on his keyring.  It made a cute little stocking stuffer or tie it with a bow on a gift.  Well worth the price!
B004MGI7HG|1|Ordered this a month ago. Never showed up. Filed a claim and never heard anything back. Absolutely not happy. Will not be ordering from this company again.
B006CSP77K|5|Worked great!
B005RV46WA|4|Good grip seem to be made quite well but I wouldn't expect them to hold up to well in a crash. I would recommend a buy though.
B000E81VN8|5|I couldn't be more pleased with it! I opened it and was preparing myself for the \\"awful odor\\" that other reviewers have been describing, and I was pleased to find that mine did not have this problem! Didn't need to \\"air\\" it out at all - opened the buckles, popped it up, tested the velcro - everything was in great condition and appears to be a very high quality product.    I would say that the dividers were a little less sturdy than what I'd imagined - but it's compensated by the fact that it's very easy to move the dividers to resize the individual compartment sizes. The handles on the sides and mini pockets in the front and back (for small items) are all very helpful features.    All in all the ROLA does exactly what I wanted it to and it fits great in the trunk of my sedan. I was able to transform my messy trunk into a very organized and respectable space in less than 5min, thanks to this!
B00FI6TJRQ|5|I'll keep this short and to the point:<br /><br />1. 25 Foot Cord (on more recent mfg dates). We ordered 2 of these. One had a 25 ft cord and the other a 16 ft cord.<br /><br />2. Quality - Far above and beyond. Internal relays, fuses, and microprocessors are so overbuilt, it's awesome! I am not surprised at all that GE gives a 3 years from date of mfg warranty. This type of warranty is nice when buying on Amazon because often (not always) the mfg does not require a receipt from where you bought it, and sometimes mfgs don't like their products sold on Amazon and eBay. They usually just go by the date code. However, if your unit was mfg 6 months before you got it, I would save my receipt and I bet you would be ok for 3 years from receipt date. Anyway, it far exceeds the 1 year \\"standard\\" warranty I was expecting.<br /><br />3. Secure mounting bracket - While it is true that the charger is not extremely rigid on the mount, it is beyond secure! The unit can be wiggled while on the bracket if you make an effort to do so. When you wrap the cord around the charger in real world situations, it doesn't budge. The secure locking wall mount: If you just used lag bolts through the charger into a stud any, would-be thief, could remove the cover and remove said bolts. The wall bracket is 99.99% secure with the key because you cannot get to the lag bolts by removing the cover off the unit. The bolts are in the bracket behind the locked charger! If theft is of no concern, then this is a benefit that you will never realize, but it's certainly a great design. The theft-deterrent design also uses a cylindrical key lock with a round key which cannot be easily drilled out as a regular lock could.<br /><br />4. It is large at almost 24\\" tall, but who cares. It wraps the cord up quickly, it houses spaciously, lots of great components, and it does what it's suppose to do with no issues. LED light is nice, but I do throw my breaker when not in use, mainly to protect it from surges or storms.<br /><br />5. Well packaged by GE and then again by Amazon. Arrived safely and in perfect condition. Price is AWESOME! Capable of up to 7.2kw charging which is great for future EV's!<br /><br />I am using this for my 2014 Nissan Leaf S with 6.6kw Charging upgrade.<br /><br />I installed next to my panel with 8/2/g wire, a 40 amp breaker (per directions), and wired it through the back of the unit so no wires are visible and no conduit was needed.

B003YJ8TVQ|5|We have two receptacles (car cigarette lighters) available for charging things while driving - but need at least 3. One of the receptacles is to the left of the radio; the other is to the right. While it *sort of* works to plug in two devices, the cable from the one on the left gets in the driver's way. Also, at night, the light from the plug going into the receptacle bothered my husband - so - this four-way socket is the perfect solution! It allows me to plug in two non-usb devices and two usb devices, perfect for two phones and a GPS device. There's room for one more device in the socket, which we haven't had to use yet. What's perfect about it is that there is no light coming from the Bestek device, so it's not distracting to the driver. The socket itself is attached to a longer cord, allowing me to plug in cables away from the driver where it's neither in the way nor distracting. A perfect solution for us!
B000FKBQTE|5|Bought this product 2 years ago, and it is still working great.

B000GTV1KS|3|This tool was not long enough to remove the damper rod from an xvs 650 v star, though the company website claims that it is the correct tool.  Also, it didn't quite fit in the top of the damper rod.  I put duct tabe around the end and checked the fit on a rod I had already removed then hammered in a longer pole to the other end to get the proper length and leverage.  You definitely have to have SOMETHING to help take the rod out if you are completely tearing down your forks and don't have an impact wrench.
B00BLYHU48|1|Ok, seriously...this helmet is CRAZY BIG!<br /><br />I checked the reviews - did I listen? No, of course not!  Lol!<br /><br />I served in the Army when we wore steel pots and at the end got the Kevlar ones....they were BULLETPROOF and smaller than this helmet!  Serious!<br /><br />My wife died laughing...It big beyond words.<br /><br />Didn't order it Prime...so it's not worth it to send back a $50 helmet for $20 shipping...I'll sell it at the next swap meet at my HD dealer for $20 or something to someone who thinks they are buying it for someone else!<br /><br />So, I am now the proud owner of one from biker helmets.com and am happy. I can't wait for Amazon to start carrying the &#34;smallest dot helmet&#34; - I'm goona get one for my wife and son when they do.<br /><br />100% - and I really don't like to write bad reviews at all - do not do this!

B003U53J0A|5|This is a good product. I preceded my last oil change with Lubro-Moly Pro-Line Engine Flush, and today I can see that the oil is still clean after 3 months. Also, if you need to periodically add oil to your engine, follow this by adding Liqui Moly 2020 Motor Oil Saver immediately after the oil change. It will stop any leakage like magic.
B00AOIM2CC|5|First of all, I have to thank the Big Three, as my cars are a 2009 Ford Edge, a 2005 Jeep Wrangler and a 1996 Cadillac DeVille, representing all of them, and they made the OBD-II ports in all three cars very accessible, but, not obvious, so that they do not detract from the look of the cars.<br /><br />This device plugged in easily in all three cars. I was able to locate and easily install the iPhone app, EngineLink, from the Apple AppStore for $5.99. And, the default settings for the EngineLink software worked perfectly for all three cars!!!<br /><br />I do not usually review items I buy on Amazon.com, but, I'm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this item!!!
B00LUPOSD4|2|The idea is good but I don't think you have to invest in these.  You can use tools you already have.
B000BPSWFY|5|I live in GA, so I don't need it very often. Perfect size to keep in my car for a frosty morning.
B0013ERRSK|3|While this pet watering device is totally unique, it has some flaws.<br />Pros: First, it was the only pet watering device we could find that can be used conviently in the car, without creating spills and messes.<br />Easy to fill, easy to use and almost spillproof.<br />Cons: the &#34;bowl&#34; is almost too narrow and deep for small dogs and most cats to use with ease.<br />We used this on a 500 mile trip with our cat and he could barely reach the water level when the container was filled according to directions - we had to fill it above normal levels in order for Cubby to reach the water on his own.<br />If you tipped it, he could reach it more easily, but do you really want to keep your<br />hand inside a carrier tipping the container so your pet can reach the water for an entire trip?<br />I think it would be very difficult for pug nosed dogs to use.<br />In order for a cat or short nosed dog to reach the water, you have to tilt the &#34;bowl&#34; portion of the container toward the animal.<br />If they would make the &#34;bowl&#34; wider and shallower, it would certainly improve its utility.
B005NFJ7GA|5|(Perfection) good fit one hell of a price and on time delivery
B000CAINRK|5|I used it to make a &#34;dead cat&#34; for my shotgun microphone- worked great up to 30 mph winds (used my car with mic sticking out of the moonroof).  I had this velcro'd around the simple foam windscreen during the test.
B0094IFIE2|5|Good filter good price
B00IABVY6U|5|It was easy to install
B000GKAZCW|5|As advertised ... fast ship and worked perfectly.
B00MGIJZUU|5|The pedals look amazing on my 2013 sonata. A little bit of work to install, it took me around 20-25 min. I have no mechanic background.
B00AERSDWG|4|Overall good guage to have
B0068REYWO|5|as advertised, quick delivery
B005K8YUX0|5|These Weathertech floorliners fit my 2012 Subaru Outback perfectly. I'm extremely please with them. They arrived sooner than I expected which is always good.
B0083HOY9U|4|Perfect fit, look good
B00IGEAPGG|5|Buy it its worth the money
B005CLL830|4|Easy to install. So far works well, But its only been on for about 5 days now.
B000C5HGO6|5|I replaced this myself, really easy to do, just beware that it DOES NOT COME WITH THE GASKET, but you can get one for like 2 dollars at advance auto parts (Fel Pro 71216). Fixed stalling issue.
B00JIJ4LWW|4|I just used it and it seems to work very well. Sofa looks like new. I would have given it one more star but I have no way of judging it so soon.
B005P7CKAQ|4|Great product; only problem is that there are no instructions/illustrations to view. This would allow you to verify you are installing it properly.
B00HPKB070|5|Lights work. It's my car that doesn't...
B00062YKMQ|4|Fit an worked well.
B007Q1MMAM|5|Fits perfectly. Looks and works great.
B003INQ8QQ|2|I bought a 2 pack and the first one lasted about two weeks, it worked great at first but should last longer than 2 weeks! It quit heating the contents which was coffee.
B007TWOM10|5|Perfect
B009OBW29S|5|I washed and then clayed my Mercedes before applying this product. The wax goes on easy and comes off with very little effort. Just follow the instructions and you will have success. Really brings out the shine and depth of the Black paint on a Mercedes!
B00F5LWJBC|5|Probably the handiest tool for full hookups out there. The screw in attachment and house support are definite must haves. In comparison to the hose that came with my camper, this is lightyears beyond in terms of quality and overall usefulness. A must buy for even the casual camper.
B006785N42|3|It's a good item and price. HOWEVER, it's listed as 160 piece and the kit we got is only 140 pieces.
B000FQ7LL0|5|I have always been jealous of other 'froaders who had nifty Powertanks on their rig but there was no way I was paying $400 for one myself.  I happened to find a low cost tank elsewhere on the web and then found this regulator.  Of course you'll need a hose too if you don't already have one, but this is the critical ingredient to making your own power tank.  It is small and easy to install, but works great.  I have used it several times around the shop just to test it out, so I can't yet speak to its long term durability.  But if you have a 5 gallon portable air tank and are sick and tired of having to refill it every single time you use it, then this and a CO2 are what you want.  Plus now I can throw an impact wrench and air chisel into my truck when I take off hills and have the convenience of air tools when I'm miles away from an air compressor.  My plan is to eventually own 5, 10 and maybe even a 20 lbs tanks as I find them cheap on craigslist, and this regulator can be transferred from one to the other as I need it, depending on where I'm going or what I'm doing.
B005909KWA|1|I was taking off my car radio and the POS broke in half, the dash is plastic and only has 4 clips. I barely put any force on it and snapped in half!! Piss poor product.........Please do not ever buy this product!! Waste of money. You pay for what get. I would never EVER recommend this product. I hope the manufactor is happy with my donation.
B000H94F6E|2|I don't know what the issue was but for some reason after hooking it up correctly there was just a clicking sound and the battery never held a charge.  I see other reviews say it not good for jumping a dead battery just charging a low one.  I just got high gauged jumper cables and got it starting again.
B00D3298A0|5|Much nicer than I expected for the price. I had to trim slightly to fit my 02 Trailblazer, but I had expected I would need to trim some off. At this price I expected a flimsy product that would suffice until I could afford something better, but I was surprised by how thick and durable these floor mats actually are. My 2 yr old dropped a sippy and the lid came off spilling drink all over the mat just a couple hours after I installed them. Saved the carpet from being sticky or stained, and the mess easily washed off the floor mats.
B00JBQMJ3K|5|Great deal for the money.
B004GDFCKA|4|As listed<br /><br />Would help if they had the color scale to match the interior/model<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone looking for replacement parts
B009R57LBU|5|Overall pretty good. Kids really enjoy on our jeep. Only drawback is the nose. Big twistie tie holds the nose on and fabric is starting to wear out for just being on jeep for about a month.
B00029XAYM|5|I bought this for my kid's violin practice to mark the spot on the finger board. It does the trick without leaving any residue.
B004QFBOEQ|5|This is my third pair of these glasses. Not because they break but because I play rough. They look great for casual or if you're in the pits with your gear still on covered in the shit... Just can't say enough about 'Em...
B000EDST1K|5|I wouldn't cut anything on it.  Great for any area where you need extra counter space.
B00JBI9BJ8|5|Thank you. Satisfied
B007552NHQ|1|It fits, but doesn't seem to reflect any heat.  Both times I've used it it has been so hot I can barely touch it, and of course radiating that heat into my car.  Just does nothing to keep my car cooler.
B001B5DZUA|2|clutch pressure plate and disc are direct replacements for the vehicle, but the throwout bearing is an all-in-one unit with the slave and arm combined.  my 2005 oz rally has a normal clutch pivot arm, an external slave cylinder and a normal throw out bearing.
B00D3298A0|5|Best  floor mats ever!!!#!!!!#!! They fit amazing in my 2011 durango and are great for traction and they even look cool !!!! Best value and look expensive
B003UTH088|1|It specifically said that this Fob did not need factory or locksmith assistance. When I received the Fob and the one half sheet of paper that came with it, I then discovered that it can only be programmed at the dealer. Waste of time and money! I could have just gone to the dealer to begin with, lame.....
B00AWPHLD2|5|will buy again
B0001EFSTI|4|Looks great and is actually functional too. I've used it to tighten screws here and there around my gate or around the house and it saves me the trouble of looking for/getting my tool box.
B00914A69Q|5|Fits great and easy to install. Glad I bought them.
B005D9HPM4|5|Excellent!
B000C5WCN6|5|Great replacement upstream o2,
B00OQPRPK8|5|I got this for my son and daughter-in-law and they loved it.  They have a min-van and it  helps keep the kids things off the van floor.
B00801RHG6|5|I loved it and as soon as I get the money im going to try and order the rest to replace the other ones
B008ZAYGVG|1|I didnt know the turn signal lights depended so much of this Hazard Warning Switch, thats why i bought it cheap and from China... Huge Mistake!<br /><br />This Switch is the heart of the Turning Lights; if it is failing, the turn lights fail. And since this is a cheap item, in the end you get a noisy switch that sometimes allows you to have turning lights and other times no.
B005FKAVDG|4|I Like The Way They Feel. They Do A GrAt tJob! ! !
B0017OGA70|5|Great for for my husband's HD 2003 Heritage Soft tail.
B002R1PRWQ|5|This was exactly what I needed to replace my light that had a chip from a rock that had hit it while driving on the parkway.  It was an exact Subaru replacement and easy to replace the entire unit.  Quick delivery, fair price, well pacckaged
B005HJB0JY|4|Bought for my 4-wheeler since the place I was working for doing ATV rescue required everyone to have a flag. The screw on mine can seem to be loose sometimes but I just make sure its really tight.
B000C53TR4|5|They do what they are supposed to. Make sure you get a limited access spring compressor for the front struts. The standard auto zone rental won't do. I used this successfully. http://amzn.com/B0075CQLV8
B003G9DD8S|5|fits perfect, works like the factory unit.
B004VIA0IY|4|The hard plastic armour placement was good, the jacket itself comfortable and the shipping speed was fine...the only problem is that the belly band has the worlds worst velcro on it and it comes undone while you are riding all the time. Other then that a nice product, although I'm not too sure how long the mesh will last. Time will tell.
B000JKTU2K|5|Great
B00LULJIW4|1|Can't handle 2 amp. USB splitter says griffin but looks like a knock off. Gets hot and stops charging every couple of minutes.
B001BC55WO|4|Look great on the car, and easy to install, but...gives intermittent tail light out warning on display despite working properly so prepare to get some resistors and if you're an early e39 owner you'll need to pick up a pair of 7507 bulbs for the turn signals.
B000KYX7AQ|5|directions were not obvious, but once I figured them out, it worked perfectly.
B008A9SDMK|5|Loved it!
B00Y9JWD26|5|Well, I have not driven more of 100 kms...<br />My car is a honda Accord v6 2009<br />But, I can say:<br />I feel the accelerator of my car better, faster.<br />The engine feels more dynamic and it sounds great.<br />The fuel economy I do not have data yet, but I guess less using accelerator, at the end there will be less consumption.<br /><br />Finally the investment is really minimal for the benefits received.
B00DQUT6E2|5|Excelent
B002NF325U|1|Amazon and Fram filter guide says it fits 2011 Ford Edge. NOT TRUE! Filter comes in a plastic cage that doesn't fit the opening in the filter compartment. It will fit if you remove the filter from the plastic housing first.  Not sure how Fram could fail so miserably.
B0040CVZI0|5|I used these to replace the missing clips on my grille.  They fit fine and were shipped quickly, in a box that looks like it would be sitting on a dealer repair shop shelf.
B002EFUL58|5|These decals were really a great gift for anyone who loves their Porsche and drives fast!  The person I gave them too was thrilled.
B00B1VV7V8|5|It was just what I was looking for.
B000EEU0IO|3|It needs something to make ir stick in the seat
B00KWMQYUQ|5|It fits well! Good quality
B0074MQF1A|5|Loved the cute pink case! No problems with it, it works as described!<br />Five stars! I Would definitely repurchase!<br />Thanks!
B0002Z9QO4|3|Does the job, just robs you 7-10 mpg.  Good for short trips but longer I wouldn't recommend...
B008F4KK0I|2|I feel slightly deceived, there is not a Nissan Logo on the key as advertised. The lock smith said I would have to have the key programmed by the dealership. Do not use this key, until it is programmed, because it will cause your vehicle to cut off for security reasons. I learned this the hard way.
B00NM8IA3G|2|its was so small
B005KVLX50|5|makes the job easier
B00KHTYL1S|5|Just got it today, took about a week, love it, I have a Nissan Maxima so I put the info into Youtube on how to get it to work with my car, took less than three minutes! And it glows in the dark, love it!
B00L9NHZGY|3|Had no instructions just a box of parts. May have been extra parts but again for a part specific to my truck it was not straight forward.
B00B2YE4B4|5|Ok
B00AZMICOY|5|It keeps hot things hot, and cold things cold.  For a LONG time.  It didn't seem to matter whether it was a hot or cold item, the temperature changed by a pretty steady ~1.2 degrees per hour.  Yes, one point two.  That means that your ice will last all day, or your last cup of coffee will burn your tongue almost as bad as the first.  Or, most importantly, the last glass of beer is just as refreshing as the first.
B00HG9ZNEQ|4|My family and friends love it and wants their own!
B00DNAOH2G|4|Haven't actually installed this item yet.  From the appearance, I wish it had been a little thicker...but it will work fine to protect the painted back bumper.
B000FJR0QI|5|I am a marine technician and I use this when performing compression tests. the hot circuit light is a nice feature
B001BFRQDW|5|They wanted $175.00 to $210.00 at local parts stores for this part. This one works great and at a price that's great. It only take a few minutes to replace these too.
B002CUUK9M|5|Easy install and stopped the back fire from exhaust! Best bang for the buck.
B002TID2AQ|5|This fits my 2012 800xp ranger perfect.
B000H6QWWC|5|They're just what I was looking for. Love the easy ratchet, makes tie down quick on any loads. Quality product would highly recommend
B0016LE4HM|1|does not work good, if you have something warm on it and leave it like that for 2hrs it{s going to get almost cool
B00630IZYO|5|these smell really nice, very strong smell
B000EVWDAK|4|I got this scan tool so we could recover codes before taking our vehicles in for service. It is fast and easy to use. I also like how it displays a small description along with the code. Some of the cheaper scan tools just display the code and make you look them up. I plugged it in, turned the car on, and in a few seconds knew exactly what was wrong with my car.    I dont care for the PC software supplied. I was dissappointed when i installed it and realized I would have to pay an expensive fee to receive more diagnostics info each time you scan a vehicle. The info from the tool is good enough anyway.    I would recomend this product. I think it would be hard to find a better scan tool for the price.
B00433SIPY|5|This kit worked well for us. I have seen other reviews mention a lubricant to help with the application. We just cleaned the windows really well and then wiped them with a wet microfiber cloth so they were a little damp. The plastic card also works great for putting screen protectors on phones and tablets.
B000ND0WB6|4|Aligator clips make the battery tender MUCH more versatile.Not many batteries are able to accomodate the \\"2 pin plug\\"& this is quite dissapointing when it arrives,and it is not ready to use w/o clips.Actually Battery Tender should INCLUDE,or at least make the buyer aware that these clips are most often a must.It would be advisable for them to include this assembly,even if the price goes up  5 dollars,it is well worth getting the full compliment of accessories to get a completely functional unit. Saves time and shipping.Amazon does list these as a\\"most often purchased with\\"accessory,but it is quite essential&most people are unaware of this.On the plus side,it is a a great product,once you can use it!
B003NJAGI6|1|No instructions given. Was able to get the remote start working but not the door locks by searching for wiring diagrams from other products to figure this one out. Range is vastly overstated. I was lucky to be able to start the car from the kitchen door 50 feet away.
B009VOQ05U|5|It was everything I expected it to be
B00839LHDO|5|Perfect for my pontiac g6! I do have to use glue to make sure these little diamonds dont come off, just the 1 dollar glue from the dollar tree is good enough. These make my car look shine bright like a diamond! Ha
B002P8SO26|5|So my original mirror fell off at a gas station when I hit a pole. (don't drive when you're really tired)<br />I did a bit of research and decided to go with this mirror. TYC is a pretty reputable brand. Their products are very decent quality. My new mirror has been serving me well and works just like the original. Install is very straight-forward and self-explanatory.<br /><br />The only con is that it comes in black so if you have an EX model and your car is not black, you'll have one black mirror like me. But no biggie.
