B008NCSZQ8|5.0|too much action, you need to see it more than one time,to see it all,besides i like adventure movies and or shows
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the entire series. Cassandra Clare's writing style makes for a pleasant and fun read for people of all ages.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting plot twists. This book had me from beginning to end. Flynn writes a very believable story with thought out characters. I wish there was a sequel or even a prequel to this book.
B005FISBV2|5.0|I am not as concerned about any spoilers in the previews that show before the episodes because I don't buy the set to watch it for the first time, but to keep it for my collection of one of the best shows on television and the fabulous Michael C. Hall. Most fans have already watched the series and are buying this to re-watch. Love this series and it arrived in perfect condition.
0143124544|5.0|I have to be honest. I don't think I would have read Me Before You by JoJo Moyes if it wasn't a book club selection, but I am so glad that I did. Generally, I would not read about the heartbreak of a healthy, active man who due to an unfortunate accident becomes confined to a wheelchair as a quadriplegic; I would have thought the subject matter to be too tragic for me. But, JoJo Moyes wrote such an absorbing, character-driven novel that although intense, became a story more about friendship and love than of disability and limitations. Although the book tackled the controversial issue of the right to die, both sides were presented intelligently, vividly and poignantly. This book surprised me in a very good way.
0425269205|4.0|Bought from America as a gift and the delivery service and time was great. Expensive for a book, but is very nice product for fans.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|When I first started reading Slammed, I was pretty turned off. I thought it was odd how Will and Lake moved so fast in their feelings for each other in those first three days. And then I considered putting the book down when “the thing” was revealed that required they terminate their relationship. But again, I trust the BOTM selections from my favorite goodreads group and I continued. I was relieved when it was evident the author’s intention was not to romanticize this particular subject. Slammed ended up being a beautiful, endearing story. I loved the addition of the Avett Brothers’ lyrics and the slam poetry. There are some really good life lessons to be learned in this book and I like that this book is spreading these lessons to all ages through it’s popularity. I also hear that a movie may be in the works for Slammed and its sequel. I have lots of favorite parts in this book but the moment that tugged at my heart the most was Eddie’s eighteenth birthday and the tear-jerking gesture by Eddie’s foster dad. Eddie was an exceptional character to complement Lake in this story. Will and Lake’s brothers were a riot. I just loved them. There are a few surprise plot twists/turns in this book that stir the emotions. I’m glad I read Slammed and I plan to continue the series.<br /><br />My favorite quotes:<br />“There are three questions every woman should be able to answer yes to before they commit to a man. If you answer no to any of the three questions, run like hell.&#34;…&#34;Does he treat you with respect at all times? That's the first question. The second question is, if he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? And finally, does he inspire to be a better person? You find someone you can answer yes to all three, then you've found a good man.”<br /><br />“Don't take life too seriously. Punch it in the face when it needs a good hit. Laugh at it.”<br /><br />“So what if the heartaches you wrote last year isn't what you're feeling today. it may be exactly what the person in the front row is feeling. What you're feeling now, and the person you may reach with your words five years from now- that's why you write poetry.”ches you wrote last year isn't what you're feeling today. it may be exactly what the person in the front row is feeling. What you're feeling now, and the person you may reach with your words five years from now- that's why you write poetry.”
0307352153|4.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me and after watching a T.E.D. Talk on youtube from the Author Susan Cain, I decided I would take a look.  I've learned a whole lot about myself after going through this book I feel like my eyes have been opened up to the people around me and how they respond and why they respond the way they do to their environments.  Great book!
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|Always anxious for any new Panic! release. This is a great album with some great classic Panic! songs, a couple stand-outs for me are Casual Affair (a bit different and very heavy!, rather Industrial sounding), the single Miss Jackson is contagious. I have to listen to it a few more times yet, but I think it kind of misses a bit of the non-stop surprises that first attracted me to the band on &#34;Pretty Odd&#34;. Seems a bit more mainstream now, not quite so adventurous. Don't get me wrong, I still love this band. The vocals of course are out-of-this-world, and song structure is strong. Musically, it's all there, and it's still very much Panic! At The Disco! I would just love to see and hear these guys push themselves to the limits again for a totally over-the-top in-your-face masterpiece like &#34;Pretty Odd&#34; is, was, and ever shall be !!!
B003SNJYSK|3.0|The Redbreast seems to start well - Harry is part of a team protecting the US president during a diplomatic summit,the action kicks in quickly with Harry lining up to shoot a potential risk.<br /><br />Then the story jumps slightly backwards in time, then very far backwards (like WWII.) The presidential storyline unfolds only to be an interesting if not expensive way to get Harry moved along to inspector. The the most of the first thirds of the book the story jumps between a mystery fellow in the end years of the war, and Harry's investigation of skin-head gang activity.<br /><br />While the historic storyline is nice enough, its hard to gel with the modern story.<br /><br />Eventually the flashbacks end, and the best part of the book begins where Harry woos Rakel, and the action picks up again.<br /><br />Somehow the book keeps dragging on however, and ends on a slow note. Overall Redbreast is a good book, but the slow parts make the reading an effort rather than an enjoyable ride.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Very possibly the most powerful and diverse Dream Theater ever! Mike Mangini really shines and comes alive on this release, as do the entire bands' performances. Well mixed with excellent production, each individual musician really highlighted and mixed together perfectly as a band, with much focus on the songs themselves. It's obvious that much thought, love,and hard work went into this release.  Really put to rest any uncomfortableness that I earlier felt when Mike Portnoy left the band. Dream Theater seems to be truly functioning well as a 'band unit', with great emphasis as always on the indiviual performances. Very Well Done..... it will take a very long time to get tired of listening to this one with great joy! No fillers here, A superb album from start to finish. Thank You Dream Theater!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Of the reacher novels so far. Having started with number seven. Perhaps it was the more personal story line re he and his old buddies.
B00BGIC3T6|5.0|HILARIOUS....really looks At getting older (and fighting it) in a very funny way...ignore the haters....if you can't laugh at a Apatow flick...you might need to find a sense of humor as you've lost yours :) Great chemistry between the leads too!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I began reading this book with skepticism but in short order couldn't put it down.  Mitch Albom once again delivers a finely crafted story  with heart and meaning.  Highly recommended!
B006JD48NM|5.0|Anyone who knows who Ayrton is HAS to have this DVD. It takes you through his joys and dissatisfactions In F1. It will make you laugh and cry. It will make you love him all the more. Just wish he was still with us as he was &#34;One Of A Kind&#34; in personal life as all he did for his home country and for his Fans on and at all the Tracks all over the world.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this series.  Had to read back to back.  Intense, romantic, edge of your seat, and has you literally laugh out loud.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Just &#34;the Best&#34; - A Must Have for RHCP Fans! Feels like you are actually at this one of a kind concert! Masterpiece!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Action packed, heartwarming, some romance, edge of our seat suspense.  Great for any age or for a female or male.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Great story line, Kept fairly close to the book, Actors have grown into their roles.  Enjoyable to watch and good quality CD
B003O86FMW|5.0|Action packed, heartwarming, some romance, edge of our seat suspense.  Great for any age. Both females and males will enjoy.
B003QSJDZQ|1.0|Bought with Amazon Instant Video. The video does not work. Out $$$. All you get is a black screen. No clue how good movie is. Boo Amazon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Action packed, heartwarming, some romance, edge of our seat suspense.  Great for any age or for a female or male.
B009MYARIK|2.0|Kind of goes on & on with a highly unbelievable story line.  I have read all of her other books and very much enjoyed them.  this truly is the 1st book by her that I really didn't care for.  i finished it but many times thought of doing otherwise
B00007FKPY|5.0|A great musical occasion of the twentieth century, and recorded for posterity--what's not to love?!  Considering its age (and the attempt to capture the ambience of the Bayreuth Festival House's unique acoustic with only mono recording, it turned out beautifully.  Hans Knappertsbusch was one of the great &#34;slow&#34; conductors, but the funny thing is--it doesn't FEEL slow (The first &#34;Parsifal&#34; I ever heard was a Met broadcast in 1982, and I fell asleep about 1/2 hour in).  Wolfgang Windgassen (Parsifal) was the essential Bayreuth tenor-of-all-work in the 50s and 60s, and he's just fine here.  Martha M&ouml;dl is an especially intense Kundry; George London an anguished Amfortas, and Hermann Uhde a snarling, malevolent Klingsor.  In the end though, I was most impressed with Ludwig Weber's Gurnemanz--an ungrateful role in that he bears the burden of telling (at great length) the entire backstory of the opera to the younger generation of Grail knights and squires.  Weber not only doesn't tire noticeably (it helps that he's not on in Act II), but he maintains interest--as I said before, it's a slow performance, but it never &#34;feels&#34; slow.  The price is just right for this release, and although there isn't a printed libretto, the (German-only) libretto can be found on naxos.com.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this Game. it is super fun to play. I'm glad I got it. thanks for such a great game.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|This is a cool film. Great story and well worth watching.  Thoroughly enjoyed watching it and interesting to learn about the origin of Captain America.
B004GYY714|5.0|Works well, and I can get the channel's I like. Comes in clear with no static. Easy to operate as well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive! Great game! I had heard people were playing and asking each other what level they were on, so i decided to try it and see what all the fuss was about. Now I'm asking what level are you on!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book!  When the last page was done, I said......  NO!  It can't be over!  I hope there is a second book.
B00DPY95D6|1.0|Although this was a unique and intriguing mystery, there was no logical (or even illogical) ending. None of the situations the main character faced were addressed. I understand wanting to write a sequel, but I feel there should be at least a partial conclusion to the first novel.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was a fun quick read that brought me back to the computer and video games I played growing up before I had to become a responsible adult.  I found myself drawn into the story and trying to solve the riddles along with the protagonist (and actually getting annoyed with him for not figuring out the second gate quickly enough from what was an obvious clue to me).  Reading this made me yearn for getting out my old Atari 2600 to play Adventure and Commodore 64 to play some Infocom games and Elite.  Emulators just won't do.<br /><br />I look forward to whatever Ernest writes next.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is not everyday that a few thousand words change a person's life. After reading this book, that is what happened for me. I understand that is truly cliche, but true none the less. This book is a work of art. Many say that it sounds unbelievable and that teenagers do not speak in such fashion. This is simply untrue. One must consider that these particular adolescents have faced the scary thing that goes bump in the night, aka cancer. Therefore already placing them ahead of their peers in mental maturity.<br />It is a simple love story with a few complexities. It happens quite fast. First they become great friends and then fall in love \\"slowly then all at once\\" the quotes you can get from this book are unreal. Such wisdom and beauty.<br />Perhaps my favorite thing about this book was the way it ended. Without giving it away...you receive the closer that is not located in the Peter vanhouten book, An Imperial Infliction. You know from the first page that this book was not going to have your typical HEA. Don't be detoured, you will still enjoy the ending and the simple teenage love.<br />I would recommend this book to any book reader. In fact, I quite frequently do. I own both the ebook and the audio version. I have listened/read them both many times. The story never becomes a bore. Each time I find something I missed previously.<br />I don't think I have ever fallen in love with two characters as much as I love hazel and Augustus.<br />Read it. Listen to it. Go watch it when the movie comes out. It is a grave tragedy that books this wonderful aren't plentiful.
B0035LMTZA|3.0|Action stayed up most of the movie. If you like a movie with car chases and action you will probably enjoy it.
B0018STVHQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Acting was amazing as was the storyline. You can't go wrong with this one.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I felt that this was a great movie that made a quick pass of the extended time couldn't believe it went  so quick. The story line is good and I enjoyed it from  the start to the end.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|Giving all apps I have from Amazon App Store a 1 star. It seems all the apps require that the Amazon App Store App be installed and logged in for the app to work. This appears to be true regardless if the app is free or paid. I recommend you get all your apps directly from the Google Play Store app. I will never buy or download a free app from Amazon again. Very frustrating when you have to login to another app (Amazon App Store app) to get the app you want to use to work.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I love Charlie and Ron. Its good to see them in other roles. I love SONS, but I like them in other things too. I wish Ron would hurry up and do HellBoy 3.
B00CY0JY88|5.0|Can't wait for captivated by you. Am hoping it comes outby christmas  These books are just AWESOME!!!!!  I. LOVE IT. Can't wait to finish
B004132HZS|5.0|Probably the best show out there. It's funny, exciting and actually leaves me wondering what will happen until the end. Great casting as well, Freeman and Cumberbatch make an amazing pair.
B00902AKK4|4.0|First, I have this for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Many of the reviews talk about issues running this game, but so far it works just fine on my hardware.<br /><br />Next, this is a hard game.  I am reminded of Mario 64 for the old Nintendo.  You have a very simple game mechanic and a lot of puzzle levels to get through.  Theses puzzles are arraigned in different environments, all of which have \\"instant death\\" style obstacles. Your character will be frozen to death, burned by desert sunlight, fall into lava pools, and be crushed by falling acorns.  Seriously, the king of the bugs should have sent a cockroach on this mission--the little bug guy is downright fragile.<br /><br />That having been said, I personally am really enjoying it.  There are multiple goals for each level--first, just getting through it alive.  Then there are two diamonds on each level that you can also get.  Most of the time I play each level until I can get through it, and then go back and try to get the diamonds.  (Much like the level stars in Mario 64).<br /><br />This isn't a game that you'll beat in an afternoon, it has a lot of replay value.  I like the mix of strategy and skill--most of the puzzles are solved by outhinking them, but there are also places where you have to master the button moves to get past certain obstacles.<br /><br />Don't get this game if you're easily frustrated.  There have been times when I want to throw my Kindle against the wall.  However, when I finally beat a level (and I have beaten most of the ones I've tried so far, after a lot of replays) the sense of satisfaction is much better than an easier game would be.<br /><br />Recommended for people looking for a challenge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game! Pretty much the only thing I play! Who needs candy crush saga. I'm up to a million points already.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|They make it too easy  to spend your stars accidentally which must be bought. Also those who pay for the stars always win. Not even to those free players.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I enjoyed this series, I was a little unsure after the second book, but I think that it ends well and I am very pleased with this book
1419702238|5.0|My daughter loves these books.  She has all of them.  She reads them in one to two days, then is looking forward to the next release.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Flip Pix is a very fun and challenging game. Hours of fun will be had attempting to unlock the pics. I highly recommend this game for both kids and adults.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Fun story, good visuals, a little looping at times and meandering but if you're geeky it will keep you reading. It pays homage to sci do galore. Also made me want to watch War Games again and listen to Rush. I was a kid in the 80s and I remember a lot of his references, and it was fun and nostalgic.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|Very interesting story. Unique. Well written in the first person.  Little by little the background story was revealed with final details only  explained near the end - which gave the reader things about which to speculate. Great for keeping the audience engaged. A sad story too. You really feel for the main characters. A worthwhile read.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Always been a fan of these people...actually I am a new Goldberg fan...quite the keyboard playa...love to listen to this album and guess who is playing the riff....just great stuff here and a great song selection for this venue.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|CATCH-22 epitomizes the inanity of life.Even if you have never been in the military you know the mindset of the commanders.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is fun and interesting when you are bored and I enjoy playing it hope you like it too please get it it is free
B000I9YLUI|5.0|Second best adaptation of this great novel.  Love Matthew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy. Although this movie was only a couple of hours long, the screenplay adopted a lot of the story in a rather compact version. Unlike the 1995 six part series on BBC which cover 90% of the story, I thought this newer version held it's own. The beauty of the scenery on location leaves you breathless. I loved the way they ended the story in a very surprising sequence...(will not give it away).
B004Q7IAQE|5.0|my kid love it<br />so soft :)<br />and she love the size of it too<br />i think i will buy her another one
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Great movie..a must see...fact shipping too..5stars learned what this man was all about..great actors too..Impressed with the quality of this movie
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great app, I love it. It's like the movie except the queen does not die. It's sort of like all the other gameloft apps, except a little bit better.
B007STBUIW|5.0|The best reproduction of Jaws on Blu-ray, its an all time classic and never looked so good , you just have to buy this if you are a collector.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love this game!!!  But I really wish they would make bad piggies space where you could make spaceships.  That would be cool!
1847946240|5.0|I bought this book for  a class I was taking. It was very helpful and an interesting read for anyone.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|Its a great family movie my kids and I love it. Its a must see movie everyone will enjoy it
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Replaced the coin batteries in both of our keyless car remotes. They worked is intended, and the price was right.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|It's apps likes this that make me glad I bought my daughter a tablet. She is so far ahead of her classmates that i really don't know what to do about school any more. This app especially has been very helpful and it has taught her so much in the way of letters and being able to associate them with animals and other things that she sees. Having her being to spell and read at four years old is one of the best feeling ever. The difference between these type of apps and all of the online learning courses is that she is really learning how to problem solve to become a better reader. She isn't only learning certain words and memorizing them when she sees them. She is actually able to sound them out and use the animated puzzle games in this app to learn and become more confident in her abilities to read and spell. I recommend this app to anyone with small children. You will be surprised at how much they will learn and how fast they will do it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product does everything it's suppose to do. Plan to purchase more for my other tv's so I don't have to move around the one I have. The only small issue is that the show or movie that is playing on the tv continues if try to pause or switch to new show. Quick fix is to unplug from tv and it resets itself.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|The game is AWESOME!!!!!!! There are zombies, jetpacks, cool cars and great weapons!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cool game I recommend this game  awesome
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I have to admit that I was a little frustrated after the first time I watched this movie. I have come to realize however, that every movie with Christopher Nolan's name attached, has taken me a few watches to appreciate. After the 2nd and 3rd time, I saw all the little things that make this movie much more artful than people realize. I can understand why some people don't like it, because it is very deep. There is a lot of CGI, which could be considered good or bad, but there is definitely a darker aspect to this superman.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|I never watched Dawson's Creek when it originally aired. Then one day I watched the final episode as a rerun and HAD to go back and watch the entire series on DVD. I loved it (and I was in my late 40's when I first watched it). Having not seen Dawson's Creek with the \\"original\\" music, I don't know any different than what's on the DVD's, and that was just wonderful to me. Dawson's Creek is now one of my all time favorite TV Shows, and I thought the music was just fine! I particularly love \\"Joey's Theme\\".<br />Right now I am on my third viewing of the whole series. If you've never watched the show, pay no attention to the \\"purists\\". I believe they probably have a legitimate gripe about the music, but like me, I suspect you will enjoy Dawson's Creek as much as I did, even with the \\"new\\" music.<br />A word about the theme music. While \\"I Don't Want to Wait\\" was the theme played when the show aired, the song, \\"Run Like Mad\\" was actually written for Dawson's Creek before the show aired. The FOX network decided to use \\"I Don't Want to Wait\\" because it was a well known song, on the charts. So \\"Run Like Mad\\" is actually the original DC theme!
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|Poor story line.  Looks like they tried to take elements from some of the big hits like avatar and combine them into one picture.
B003G4W49C|3.0|first read this a long time ago.  it's still not bad, but not quite as good as I remembered it.<br /><br />ender's progression in the battle games just seems a bit over the top: he is so many orders of magnitude better than anyone else who has been there before, that it looks like all the previous efforts of the military to groom potential leaders has focused on those with an IQ of somewhat less than zero.  in that way, this is unrealistic (there would be some continuity for tactics and strategy over time: Ender seems to come up with so much new stuff that has never been thought of before, it's dumb, and a distraction).<br /><br />the psychological computer game he plays could have been a story unto itself.<br /><br />the book moves along, the outcome is a bit anticlimactic, but the discovery of a chance to save the enemy race is good.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book was great, I loved it and was hooked almost right away.  It has romance, destiny, action, adventure, intrigue and a good dash of paranormal.  The hero is adorable and noble and an underdog.  I love Harry Potter and Game of thrones, Eragon and similar books, this book is almost as good as them, with the potential to be just as epic and heart breaking.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|I LOVE MINIONS.  And the rest of the characters, too.  These movies are wonderful (even to this 74-yr-old).  Got these as a Christmas gift, but frankly, I'd love to have them for myself.
0385351399|1.0|I am sad to say I could not read this book. Perhaps plot exposition this lugubrious would have worked in the 1400s, but what place does it have now, in a book about technology?  Dave Eggers is a good writer, but here, as in zeitoun, he really needs a firm editor with a grasp of flow and plot.<br /><br />And, from this author, I was expecting quite a bit more.  I was expecting  insight into issues about privacy/freedom etc. instead...so far, a lot of filler about burlap. That's not a typo. The character carries on....about burlap.
B00FWLSOOG|4.0|This movie brought back childhood memories when I used to watch Godzilla movies. This movie is filled with action, special effects and  fun! A must see if you enjoy watching robots fight giant alien monsters!
B001F6TXME|4.0|No frills remote.  Provides basic operation as you would expect.  No extras though.  This is a nice unit if you are looking for something compact and don't need fancy on remote features.
1577314808|5.0|A MUST have for anyone thinking about life and where it is taking you. It's a great read if you are contemplating a spiritual journey.
0736092269|5.0|Excellent book with everything you need. Great for beginners or guys lifting for many years. I found that some of the exercises I was performing, I was performing wrong. For me this book is all about proper technique
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wow! I finally decided to download this game! OMG! All my friends on Facebook kept trying to get me to try it. My phone does not have this app but I found it on my kindle! I am officially hooked on this game!
B00E9PMMPI|5.0|Blu-Ray quality is outstanding on this version of Fantastic Voyage. Picture & sound quality run circles around even the DVD quality. If you like this classic movie, you'll want to add this Blu-Ray version to your collection.
B00F1W1SS0|4.0|I sat down and watched this whole Blu-Ray last night for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Having been a DT fan now for decades it is nice to see this terrific performance of new and old songs.  Lots of variety spanning the band's career, terrific renditions, and some really nice documentary coverage to boot.  The glimpse into DT's pre-show rituals and non-verbal communications during the show was great.  Even my daughter sat glued and said, \\"Dad...this is great\\" during the documentary and she loved jumping up and dancing around during the actual concert.<br /><br />The band sounds tight, and is certainly one of the most talented around.<br /><br />Check this out if you get a chance.
B00D3J2QKW|5.0|Amazing book! On the first read, i thought there wasnt much stuff in it (probably was distracted). I am glad i took time to read the second time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Classic.  Classy.<br />My kind of story.  No canned laughter.  No crude jokes.  Maggie Smith and Elizabeth McGovern are wonderful as are the other actors.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|The variation of weapon s is very good.  I am also a fan of the fast paced hunt. When I run out of energy then it's time to put it away.
B00EYE0ECW|1.0|it kept telling me I was in India and when I tried to get it to show me where I was a second time I ended up somewhere else - no where near where I am I HATE that app
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Awesome book I was mesmorized by it.  Time travel is a great topic and including the Kennedy assassination just makes it even better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Worthy port of the PC version to mobile.
B007COMT1A|3.0|Pretty good.  Packaging could have been newer for it said &#34;Like New&#34; and looked pretty warn, and had old code, but pretty good product to watch
1449430295|5.0|Yearly thing and has entertainment value for my husband.  Sometimes funny, sometimes blah, but what did you expect.  Good condition and stands up well throughout the year.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game as does my family the little 4 year old up to the 36 year old. Please buy you won't be disappointed
B00275EGWY|1.0|The movie was okay, but the fact that it skipped and then stuck so I couldn't see the whole movie really sucked.  I didn't return this as again, I was just too busy and the movie parts I saw didn't impress me enough to care about the missed parts enough to request a replacement.

B00FWLDHSY|3.0|This movie was ok.<br />Not much of a plot besides robot karate with giant aliens. However we were impressed with by the fact that there was no sex or anything of that sort, and there was not much for profanity.  This movie is not much for believability or story development. They try by creating an event that the main characters past that he suffers through and is haunted by for no real purpose. There was a lot of money dropped into graphics and that's about it. This is a $.99 rental.

0765325950|5.0|Finally.  The last book.  What a wait.  This series should have been about 3 - 4 books shorter.  Jordan got greedy and made a few fluff books to make money.  Can I fault him for that? From a human stand point, No.  From a stand point of overall legacy, looking back in time on this series? - Yes, I fault him seriously because this could be the greatest series of all time... instead it is one of the greatest.  Anyhow - the culmination of the final battle and the battle of good vs evil did not disappoint.  It was really hyped and still didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The only bad thing about this book is it's message.  The message is a flawed message and that being: \\"You cannot have good without evil, and without evil you do not have free will.\\"  That is bogus. The existence of free will = the possibility of evil.(Or it's not true free will.)  You don't need an evil being to have the possibility of evil - you need free will for the possibility of evil.  That is a stupid philosophy - and does put a black eye on the book because as you can see by the simple logic above - it's a false philosophy.  Other than that \\"final message\\" of the book - I loved the series and the final book was BRUTAL.  Lots of death to main characters and some great heroic moments.  Book 1 of this series is hands down the best and book 14 is top 3 - it's very good.  5 Stars.
006202406X|3.0|Allegiant brings the Divergent trilogy to a close, and it's full of promise: Tris and Tobias are headed into the outside, toward a new life that they know nothing about. There had been so much action before, culminating in Tris's almost execution; I was glued to the pages while reading the first two books, and was so looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it's not a particularly thrilling ending to a great series.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; there are parts to Allegiant that are good, and even clever. I liked the back story given for Tris's mother; it made sense and gave new layers to what happened. There's some action, and it's generally well-written. The character development is solid, if irritating; there's way too much over-thinking and not enough just going with the flow of emotion. However, Allegiant is overly padded with loooooong segments of talking about what might be going on, what is going on, what will be going on, and almost all of it has to do with genetic damage. I have to admit that my eyes began to glaze on the topic after a while because really...who cares? I never did understand who started damaging the genes to begin with, and how the &#34;repair&#34; was taking place. All of it seemed so secondary to the characters and yet it was the main focus of the story. Meanwhile, things are going down back in Chicago that must be rectified immediately and yet it seems as though there's ambivalence about it.<br /><br />My biggest issue with Allegiant, after the overly long segments wherein little seems to happen other than Tris and Tobias fighting and talk of genetic damage, is the dual points of view. I understand why we needed them, but I swear a chapter would change, and with it the point of view, and I would not notice. I'd actually read a few pages into the next chapter before I'd think, &#34;Oh, this is Tris talking now&#34;.  It's not good when your characters are so inter-changeable, and not in a good way. The voices were the same, and neither offered much in the way of excitement.<br /><br />I know a lot of people are upset over the BIG twist, and rightfully so; I do feel let down by how Roth chose to end her story. It just seemed pointless, even if it was in character for the most part. I think I could have lived with it had I felt it was a necessary sacrifice to the overall story but it just felt wrong on so many levels. Instead of being left with a feeling of completion or understanding, I'm just left empty. Sadly, this ending has soured me for the series and definitely made me unexcited about the upcoming motion picture. I'm just left feeling...damaged.er offered much in the way of excitement.<br /><br />I know a lot of people are upset over the BIG twist, and rightfully so; I do feel let down by how Roth chose to end her story.

1439177791|1.0|Being a HUGE Portia fan I couldn't wait for this book. It felt as though the story was jumping from topic to topic and then went back 3 topics beforehand. She went on about the death of her father but that was all over the place as well and you dont know how he died ( i mean im not a nosy person but if you are going to touch on the topic of your fathers death in a \\"tell all\\" book at least dont leave the reader going...\\"what? did i miss something?\\" I was interested to see what her life was like on the set of Ally McBeal and what it was like being on the set of Arrested Development. Nothing on AD and Ally McBeal was left to the imagination as well. I know she's a private person but she left out so much detail it felt like a waste of my time to read as well as a waste of her time to write it. The only thing I got from this book was how to become anorexic. I know that was a big part of her life and I too have struggled through eating disorders (not to that extent) so I could relate to that. However, she didn't really say what brought it on; if she did at all (sometimes people know), and you dont really get how she really overcame her anorexia. All I got out of this book was how to become anorexic & how to do it properly. THAT she went into full detail. The whole time I was thinking one, Im glad my niece isn't reading this who is struggling with her weight and two, Im glad Im not reading this years ago, otherwise I would have fallen deeper into my disorder because I now know what I was doing \\"wrong\\".<br />I dont recommend this for anyone; more of an anorexic's how to book. I dont even know how i finished it but I just kept telling myself, it's had such great reviews perhaps it gets better. Very disappointing and just leaves you thinking \\"what did i just read?\\"

B00E5N8DGG|4.0|Well 3.5 out of 5 I would give this blu-ray.  The show is great, the set list is awesome but finding the songs outside of Hysteria is a bit of a pain.  If you are looking for tracks 15+, you have to go into the extras and look for the Ded Flatbird night 1 and 2, it's a little odd how they did that.<br /><br />So for the show this gets a 5/5 but the audio it gets a 2/5.  The Audio shows up as HD Master Audio sounds awful.  I had to turn my sub off so I could stand listening.  When you switch to the other sound option it's on standard stereo sound.  They could have done a much better job with the audio.  Like come on, it's a bluray disc!!!<br /><br />Overall, this is a great show.  The crowd is a little lifeless at times and Joe's voice isn't always that good but this is freaking Def Leppard!  Gotta love it.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book was a torture to read. Your other books took me 1  or 2 weeks, I was excited although you wrote out some of my favorite characters.

You will probably receive my review in the Spring, after I complete reading it\\".
B000RHLY8I|2.0|This movie wastes all the potential of a great story. Horribly mis-cast, Nicolas Cage just doesn't have the gravitas to play a gun dealer. He's often up-staged by lesser character actors who do a great job. The story begins in NYC with Cage's character realizing he can make money selling guns. From there it's off to the races as he makes ever bigger deals, including some with his uncle who happens to be a general in the Ukraine, when the Soviet Union collapses and there's tons of guns, tanks, and helicopters to be had for the price of a bribe. Cage drags along his addict of a little brother as he's pursued by a determined interpol agent who shows up from time to time. Cage frequently escapes in the most absurd ways. There's the typical love interest, again, wasted potential and story time. Most amazing is that this movie comes from the same director as Gattaca and The Truman Show. Clearly the man knows what he's doing. One has to wonder, what was he thinking, making this piece with a good actor but in the wrong role? Save your money and petition for a re-make with heavy duty people who can carry the heavy load of a gun runner risking it all. The only saving grace is the first few minutes as you see bullets being made. One of the best opening title sequences ever. After that…. yawn and giggle.

Galaxy Quest takes actors that played space travelers on tv and gets the abducted by real aliens at a reunion convention. The actors think it's them being paid to perform but when things start to become very real they must band together to defeat an alien enemy and save a race of aliens. You will laugh so hard throughout this movie.
0743289692|5.0|An exceptional intelligence and an almost unique life story. In the course of a struggle to deal with her Islamic heritage in Somalia she moved to Eritrea, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Holland and USA and learned Swahili, English, Arabic and Dutch languages. She fled from a forced marriage to Holland as a refugee and there became a member of Parliament before having to leave because of death threats, and now lives in America. Her command of English is wonderful and her autobiography reads almost like a novel.

B001N09BDS|5.0|My adult son Bam recommended this movie.  Probably not something I would've chosen myself. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Leonardo DiCaprio is spectacular, many of his scenes almost 'haunting'-I thought about the scenes for a few days after watching the movie.  I've enjoyed his performance in other films, but he is better in this movie than any movie I have ever seen him in. It is a long movie, but actually I didn't want it to end... it was so engaging. Worth watching...and keeping for movie collection.  I recommend!

B008JFUS0U|5.0|Intrigue and revenge are two of the multiple themes that are displayed in Thor: The Dark World.  Both Thor and his father Odin are faced with a powerful but evil leader named Malekeith bent on inflicting suffering. This leader's taste for violent chaos comes from personal tragedy in his own life.  I enjoyed the love story that played out between the characters of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). This is because both characters seamlessly picked up where they last left off from the first film with their relationship.  Additionally, Thor's character is shown bravely taking Jane Foster to his world despite how his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) may act. Realistically, true emotion was also shown when Thor and his brother Loki are greatly affected by an event that would change many people (involving a family member).  Idris Elba is given an even bigger influential role in the plot of the film as Heimdall.  Heimdall's character portrays a sense of perceptiveness in a scene that involves him foreseeing what can happen on one of the main bridges in Asgard. Just a gentle suggestion: maybe Heimdall could be including with Thor in future films as some type of advisor to both Thor and/or his father Odin regarding protection plans for Asgard and/or other strategic mission ideas. My husband's favorite character portrayals were that of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). This is because Loki's character is portayed as a strong spirit who wisely knows how to appeal to Thor's heart-centered side while also shrewdly concealing his private and tricky plans. Eccleston's Malekith also appealed to my husband due to the character depth portrayal of what motivated Malekith's actions.  Thor: The Dark World is great for those who enjoyed the first film or those who like fantasy films with the inclusion of these other actors/actresses: Stellan Skarsgard, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Chris O' Dowd,Kat Dennings, Ray Stevenson, Zachary Levi, TadanobuAsano, Jaimie Alexander, and Rene Russo.

B00F8KIJ2I|5.0|\\"Avril Lavigne\\" by Avril Lavigne contains songs of the heart that touch on the many emotional spectrums of being in love and navigating through the test of life.  The music tunes are sprinkled with pop and rock, which complement her voice pretty well. Give What You Like, Sippin On Sunshine, and You Ain't Seen Nothin Yet are among some of my favorite songs from \\"Avril Lavigne\\" due to the cheerful messages in the songs.  However, \\"Avril Lavigne\\" by Avril Lavigne also contains other types of songs that would appeal to other sides, such as the rebellious via such tunes as \\"Bad Girl\\" and \\"Fallin Fast.\\"
B00F8KIJ2I|3.0|I was waiting for what seem like forever for this album to be released. It was SORT of worth the wait. Some of the songs seem like they belong in a teeny bopper's album and well Avril is certaintly not a teenager anymore. Here's my take on the tracks.....<br /><br />Rock N Roll - It's a fun song but not the best I've heard<br />Here's To Never Growing Up - Same as Rock N Roll<br />17 - Its a cute song about reminiscing about the past<br />Bitchin' Summer Don't like it at all. It belongs in a Disney Album<br />Let Me Go - Its a nice ballad<br />Give You What You Like - It is my favorite song by far. It's a very nice song and just what I expected from Avril =)<br />Bad Girl - Waste of a perfectly good track space<br />Hello Kitty- OMG where do I begin? What was she thinking by writing this TERRIBLE TERRIBLE song?<br />You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet  - It's Ok<br />Sippin' On Sunshine  It's also OK but should be like on a Selena Gomez Album<br />Hello Heartache  - I like this song too. Avril like indeed<br />Falling Fast - This is also a very nice song<br />Hush Hush - This one is also good.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Well made, awesome person to portray,  we need to see more movies that inspire us  I honestly think a movie like this has such a small audience. I hope I am wrong.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|While it wasn't as good as the games it was based off of, it this film hits enough high points to be worthy of the title it bears. The storyline has little to do with the games, much like the Resident Evil series of films, but draws on enough of the first two Silent Hill game plot lines to pack the general feel of them into the movie. There are only a handful of slow points and major deviations from the games don't hurt the story much. It's a creepy and sad experience and, to that end, it gets everything right.

0545586178|5.0|Loved loved loved this book far more than the first one.<br /><br />Lets talk about the characters first. I feel that Katniss had lots of development compared to the first one. She isn’t as much as an ice queen in this book as she was in the first. She tends to act how you would expect a teenager who has been through many awful things would act. She actually cries, which for a good part I was like why haven’t you cried yet? so I was glad that actually happened. You get to also to know about her feelings about the whole Gale and Peeta situation, which had me feeling heart broken at times. I Personally feel she should end up with Gale, its just meant to be, but she will always have a really deep connection to Peeta. I like her better as a strong girl who can kick arse but doesn’t always have her act together. Its more believable.<br /><br />In this book you also get to see perspective from the Capital people, which in the first book we didn’t get to see and that annoyed me. You get to know how everyone from just the simple people of the Capital to the officials feel about Katniss and all the things that revolve around her. I liked the perspective. I didn’t like how in the first one they were just these people you get no idea of, just know they are there somewhere doing stuff.<br /><br />You also get to meet more than just the Gale, Katniss, Peeta, and the people who dress them at the capital. You also meet random people, and those who are going to be in the arena. This made it more sad because people you like die.<br /><br />In terms of plot of theme or storyline or whatever you want to call it alot more happens there as well. In the first book you just see Katniss and Peeta fighting in the games and a few chapters of them at home before they get sent off. This time around we get their time at home, their tour around the districts, what happens AFTER the tour, and another round of games. Though alot more stuff happens in the same nearly the same amount of pages as the last book, some things that happen get skipped over because of the pure amount of stuff that happens. Like when Katniss finds out she can’t say goodbye her family before she goes off to the capital, I feel she would have had more of reaction at the time. She does react later, but at the that it happens is just kind of gets skipped over at the time it actually happens. Some other things probably could have been dropped or shortened, not all sections were thought out all that well.<br /><br />But from start to finish I was hooked and I stayed up all night to read it and then I straight away read at least a couple of chapters of the third book because I was so wrapped up in it. It did things like make me totally despise Haymitch, which I didn’t think could happen, because he held a spot in my heart from the first book. It also ends of a totally devastating, though great, cliff hanger. I advise those who are reading the second book have the third one handy. If you get into it like me, having to wait to get the last book is going to be painful.<br /><br />On kinda side note, I can’t wait until the movie comes out. They did a pretty good job on the last one and I’m desperate to see what they do with this one.last book, some things that happen get skipped over because of the pure amount of stuff that happens.

B00COO2D6O|2.0|After playing through free version (and sinking cash into it) decided to honor the developers by buying full version. Progress does not transfer. Levelled up several heroes (sinking more cash) .  One how lost 3 out of 7 heroes during game crash.  Lost some purchased stars during another game crash during purchase. Fun game that I am frustrated about losing heroes and cash over. No more heroes are available to purchase, so I cannot ever have a full hero team again. I don't advise in game purchases until they fix bugs...

B005LAIIJY|5.0|Oh well, I don't think that I want to go into the details / the story of the movie, since that has been done before in other reviews. I expect a movie to entertain me for a couple hours - maybe even WOW !! me a couple times - leave me with the movie for a couple hours when it's over. And, that's all and much more, what this movie did for me. Suspense = plenty = you somehow know with every new scene / little story in the big story, that this might not end well, while everybody is still smiling and trying to play along, ... you know as soon as there is an opportunity for someone in the movie to get violent / bring on justice, it well get done - always with a somehow satisfying outcome which you will never really predict. Sure, it's bloody / maybe even gory - but it's \\"holly smokes, hahaha / funny / over the top gory\\" and never \\"OMG, I don't want to see that - type of gory\\" ... it's a great movie - and I didn't realize that it was 3 hours long. ... THANKS FOR THE GREAT ENTERTAINMENT !!

B00881VLCE|5.0|So far I have had none of the problems as noted by other reviewers.  It is not easy though for someone with eyesight problems.  I can only put in a few minutes per session.  Glad it remembers where you left off each session.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I started weeping by the third chapter...and couldn't stop reading till I had finished the book. It is beautifully written and artfully narrated. An absolute MUST read.
0345803507|3.0|This was the final book and of all of them, this one was probably my least favorite. I think the poor writing got on my nerves by the time I got to this book more than ever. I tried to bite my tongue thru the other two and by this one, I was screaming in my head...use some new lines!  During sex scenes, they were always saying and doing the same things so they are boring to read, &#34;Open your eyes Ana, &#34; &#34;He is touching my sex area&#34; or whatever she called! Oh brother, give me a break.  Every chapter began and ended and in the middle had sex.  But interwoven was the climax and ending of this story of these two starcrossed lovers and how their story winds down. I suppose that is why I found this last book somewhat boring and laborious to read. However, seeing how it played out, a happy ending, and both of them on the same page, was wonderful to see. I can't stand unhappy endings.  I still left with the same feeling though, they both have huge issues so they are undoubtly well suited for each other!
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Fun to play. Don't like paying for coins. Will continue to play as long as I can without buying any coins.
0345803493|4.0|This book did a good job of explaining what really went on to make our main male character who he is and why. I still think he is a weirdo and she, Ana is sorta abit of a freak for liking all that kinky stuff too.  And the story is interesting and the romance and such but the writing is rather repetitious and some of the cliche expressions, oh geez, twitchy palms and her being outspoken, give me a break, that gets old just because she talks aloud her opinion. It is written from a shallow perspective often. And the amount of sex, sometimes it seems like that is all these people do,,,no eating, no working and no sleeping....but overall, I did find the characterization interesting and would recommend the book!
0515123447|4.0|Lee Child brings you in and gets you emotionally invested in this story. You feel the story and visually see the scenes.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|Has always been one of my favorite movies.  Who can beat the wonderful Judy Garland, and the wonderful story that is told by the excellent cast members.  A great family movie.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|If you like giant robots battling giant monsters then this is the movie for you. The story isn't Shakespeare but I was only in it for the giant robots!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Here is my other top choice of singing groups.  These young men have the most melodious, strong and compelling voices I have heard in a long time.  They are wonderful individually, and when singing together just fill me up with the beauty they are making.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its great I can see how much time I get to play and show me how much battery I have left
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|An absolute pleasure to read. The experiments were fun, and they work! I was very amazed that I created some new opportunities while performing \\"experiments.\\" I would like to buy this book for all my family and friends.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love having it so accessible. Looking at what the lord has done is so convenient with this program. very convenient
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This movie was suspenseful to the very end. You will love it. This is an absolute must see movie. You won't be disapointed
B002A9VJ40|5.0|love this movie, lived near it was filmed and have been around the planes and it is impressive. Miss, Top Gun in California but it will always be a great memory
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very addictive half my job plays this game....stress reliever......we need this game to relax us on stressful days.. thank you
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I'm fairly certain the first draft of this &#34;novel&#34; was written in crayon and then given to the author's mother to type out and put on the interwebs.<br /><br />The grammar and spelling mistakes make A Quest of Heroes nearly unreadable. However, what makes it truly unreadable is the complete lack of depth. The characters are one dimensional. the plot is predictable and nothing is given more than a perfunctory description, if that. I imagine a world with houses made of empty juice boxes inhabited by cavorting paper dolls taped to popsicle sticks.<br /><br />Adults, skip over this series, unless you're making edits so your children don't develop bad spelling and grammar habits.
B00622BF40|5.0|I love the quirkiness of this movie and the dancing was good. The story line is fun and I love the accents!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG...So much better than on my iphone!  I have trouble with my vision and this is so much bigger!  Thank you Amazon!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|\\"Passione is something more--it is a high temperature love: a title that conveys the meaning of a hot rush love and of a sweet sensual torment. In the album, we have tried to give a range of shades as wide as possible of that mysterious, wonderful kaleidoscope which oversees the concept of passionate love, the sum of heart, mind and senses. Each song brings out a nuance; every song is a variation on the theme which boosts the driving engine of the content of this exciting project. The result, of which I am very satisfied, is an anthology of some of the most intense songs ever.\\" ~ Andrea Bocelli (Billboard) ~<br /><br />If you are a dedicated listener of Andrea Bocelli's vocal art and you are following his impressive body of work, here is a recording just for you--an album filled with passion simply titled \\"Passione.\\" The album's concept is passionate love where the singer unveils anew his romantic and passionate self like he did in his 2006 album, [[ASIN:B000CC1TGA Andrea Bocelli - Amore]].<br /><br />This was released early this year in January and reached the Top Ten on Billboard 200. It is another one of his sensational recordings to add to your collection of lovely music consisting of an impressively stirring set of love songs rendered in Italian, Spanish, English, French and Portuguese. The Grammy winning singer described his latest album as \\"high temperature love: a title that conveys the meaning of a hot rush love and of sweet sensual torment.\\" According to a survey completed by Rosetta Stone, the top three most romantic songs are Spanish (#1), French (#2) and English (#3). I'm surprised Italian love songs didn't make it to the top three, but anyway the Italian songs here are some of the best from this DeLuxe Edition.<br /><br />He definitely knew what great material to choose and who among the many  singers, musicians and arrangers to select for a new album that will forever be enjoyed by its listeners. He aced all his interpretations exquisitely making all the songs listener-friendly notwithstanding most of the tracks that are rendered in different languages. Andrea Bocelli (vocals/accordion) is in very good hands with the support of his long-time collaborators, most of them  also worked with him in \\"Amore\\"-- Alan Broadbent (arranger), Jorge Calandrelli (arranger), William Ross (arranger), Nathan Kelly and Matt Della Polla (orchestrator), Ramon Stagnaro, Daniel Bonaviri and Graham Dechter (acoustic guitar), Nathan East and Keith Nelson (bass), John Robinson (drums), Rafael Padilla (percussion), Jochem van der Saag (percussion/synths/sound design), Michael Thompson (electric guitar), Caroline Campbell and Juan Carlos Albelo (solo violin), Dan Higgins (flute/sax) and David Foster (piano/keyboards/accordion/arranger).<br /><br />Trumpeter extraordinaire Chris Botti who is one of the finest trumpet players in the last decade graced this recording with the purity of sound of his instrument on three of the most lovable tracks, \\"Smile,\\" \\"When I Fall In Love\\" and \\"Il Nostro Incontro.\\" He made his instrument stand out for any listener to easily identify its distinct sound that only an impeccable trumpet player can ever deliver.<br /><br />There is the element of total radiance and clarity of vocals in Andrea Bocelli's duets with Nellie Furtado (\\"Corcovado/Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\") and Jennifer Lopez (\\"Quizas, Quizas, Quizas). These tracks are also noteworthy and certainly the charming centerpieces from this set.<br /><br />While I'm totally enamored by this album in its entirety, it would be nice to special mention my top personal favorites which include \\"Smile\\" (unforgettable and uplifting),  \\"When I Fall In Love\\" (hauntingly beautiful), \\"La Vie En Rose\\" (unique, with excerpts from the original song recorded by Edith Piaf), \\"Garota de Ipanema\\" (loved that winning whistle), \\"Tristeza\\" (charmed by its cadence), \\"Love Me Tender\\" (sweet serenade),  \\"Love In Portofino\\" (lovely violin solo) and \\"Anema E Core.\\" The English titleof the latter is \\"How Wonderful To Know,\\" a famous song of days gone by--if you can still remember--that was recorded and popularized by Andy Williams and Cliff Richard.<br /><br />When it comes to passionate and romantic recordings, you can always trust Andrea Bocelli to deliver the very best quality for the enjoyment of every listener's enthusiastic ear.<br /><br />What's not to love?of the latter is \\"How Wonderful To Know,\\" a famous song of days gone by--if you can still remember--that was recorded and popularized by Andy Williams and Cliff Richard.<br /><br />When it comes to passionate and romantic recordings, you can always trust Andrea Bocelli to deliver the very best quality for the enjoyment of every listener's enthusiastic ear.<br /><br />What's not to love?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book reminds me so much of Grisham's early writing - he  is a tremendous storyteller. He brings the events of the present time and the past to life. Having grown up in the South and having lived in Mississippi, I can tell you that although his characters sometimes seem an exaggeration, they unfortunately portray very real people and actions that did and still do exist in some places in the South. The book carries you along with the unfolding events.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My phone won't support the latest app (android, Casio G/zone) and it won't work with my chromebook. might be a great device but as of now I can't tell you.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Me and my friends love this book so much! Team Peeta! It tastes like jelly! He bakes good bread!  Yay!
0545128285|5.0|I like this book a lot.  It is not something that I would read to my children before bedtime, some of the stories would be scary to a child and they are also really long stories.  I love Harry Potter, so I read them on my own, but my six year old wanted to hear a story one day and it took a long time for us to get through one.  Very good stories and I love that they included Albus Dumbledore's notes at the end.
B003G4W49C|5.0|If you like sci-fi you can't go wrong with this book. After about midway the phase becomes super intriguing. A fast read for me.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a very fun game but frustrating at times. I keep coming back to it even if it does drive me crazy.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was a fantastic read - I highly recommend! Haven't read this author before but looking forward to reading more.
B00C6F624K|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  Peggy Sue's memories takes me back to a time of innocence.  There were many things in the movie that brought back memories.<br /><br />My sister's boyfriend had a black Impala like Charlie's blue one.  In one scene you could see a corner of a Helms Bakery Truck.  In Los Angeles, Helms Bakery had a huge bakery in Culver City.  They would dispatch trucks all over Los Angeles County.  The truck had a little air whistle and we would run out to the truck that had drawers filled with donuts, cookies, bread, cream puffs and cakes that were all baked that morning.  The inside of the truck smelled like heaven.<br /><br />I remember my sisters wearing the poodle skirts and scarfs around their necks.  What a time, what a time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Im so happy I read this book. At first I was like no way am I ever going to read it, then I saw the perview for the 2nd movie and it looks good. Then I watch the movie and just new I had to read the book…
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I loved this movie.  Many people don't understand this movie so they can't appreciate the beauty of it.  To sum it up the movie is about how the souls of two people are reunited over centuries and how their actions in one life generate consequences in the next.<br /><br />If you pay close attention you will see two souls cross paths although sometimes very briefly.<br /><br />The makeup and cinematography was phenomenal.
B005PV81MS|5.0|This is like a fun throwback to 80s sci fi. It's not super scary or funny but still works on so many different levels. The movie is exciting, colorful, comic book like, and action packed. It also reminds me of 80s movies like Ghostbusters, Gremlins, Back to the Future, ET and more. It also has the charisma of those films
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is an awsome game for kids of all ages!I myself love this game.it is an non online game so you can take it anywhere!don't be worried about crashing.but<br />Little fingers may buy stuff so be warned!
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|This movie is a must rent is you don't enjoy animated films enough to buy. All others just go out and if 3d is your way to great entertainment it won't disappoint you. I do not want to spoil this great cave-man family tale. You will have many laughs along the way and the movie tells us we all can benefit from an open mind. What you waiting for Journey back to the stone ages fora great adventure with my new favorite Stone Age family.<br />Enjoy
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Loved this book, it truly enveloped you in the characters and their pain and turmoil of this brutal time, as well as bringing you to tears and smiles . Def recommend !
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|This movie is a surprisingly good movie with a totally different pace and direction than the previous and it turns out to be a really good thing. The boy and Downey have great chemistry on camera and they make it work. Also the movie is quite funny at times and deserves a nod for trying new things. I highly recommend this to fans of Downey and Ironman. I know that some ironman fanboi's will not like this direction so if you are thinking you may be that type of person Rent It First! For all you other people grab up a great fun filled film.<br />Enjoy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game so much- I cant put it down. I even download the updates so I can see what the company can dream up next.
0141394811|5.0|I did not expect Morrissey's book to be as good as this....  Morrissey is a major artist....but obviously a flawed human being. That's important. Don't read this expecting a perfect artist or hero....they don't exist.<br /><br />Morrissey's book is full of insight and humor from his perspective..... and if you like his art with the Smiths and solo and you like to read...you will probably like this. He tells of his childhood, adolescence and young adulthood and beyond to age fifty two. As he describes his life and influences he reveals himself..... and yet still retains some mystery. This is the best autobiography by an artist I've read. The reader really gets a feeling of the essence of the artist known as Morrissey. His awareness of mortality and \\"Death at One's Elbow\\" makes his art and this book timeless.....<br /><br />His description of the trials and difficulties as well as successes of his recording career are interesting. I know this is his version, that's what I was looking for, his version of his career and life in general.  It's also obvious that he loves his fans ...they give him strength and life...and he gives it back to them.<br /><br />Forgotten Hollywood heroes like James Dean and Kirk Douglas, are brought into focus in his book. Morrissey's description and appreciation of Kirk Douglas in the roles of \\"Two Weeks in Another Town\\" and \\"Lonely are the Brave\\" are very personal to him. This really made a connection with me. I saw both of these movies when they were first released in '62. The theaters were just about empty for both of these pictures and it made me sad at the time because I thought they were so good and unusual........Morrissey was really affected by Douglas's performances and I find that very interesting because movies like these are not made anymore. They don't make 'em like Morrissey anymore either. The art and artists and life experiences that Morrissey describes have made him and his art very unusual and unique. When anyone, especially an artist, stands out from the crowd it can be a painful and lonely place.......but a place that's ultimately rewarding for the genuine individual and true artist like Morrissey. Painful or not he couldn't be any other way.....<br /><br />This book is not just entertaining, it's enlightening and he makes you think about art, justice, fame, life and death......and he makes you laugh as well. My puny review doesn't do it justice... but I recommend it, especially if you are a fan.an artist, stands out from the crowd it can be a painful and lonely place.......but a place that's ultimately rewarding for the genuine individual and true artist like Morrissey.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is very fun and kind of addicting, however there's no way to get certain features and power ups without making an in-game purchase, which I find annoying.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The maker needs to create more levels<br />I recommend this app for your<br />The only thing bad is that they ask you to rate the app 100 times
B0080M3OGW|2.0|This movie was crap. Don't watch it. You instantly dislike the two lead characters. Not a good sign. Avoid it!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|While I really enjoy playing Candy Crush Saga, the time it takes to &quot;earn&quot; a life is very frustrating. Remove that and its worth 5 stars.
B00FM8WGK2|5.0|This doll is absolutely GORGEOUS!!! I love her shirt and the pants are perfect!!! So glad I got her as soon as I saw her on here!!!! She is going to be one of the best xmas gifts for my lil ghoul.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is challenging and fun, sometimes too challenging and frustrating but for the most part a lot of fun.  Very addictive.
B003TNQEF0|3.0|Wasn't a bad movie overall, but the ending really wasn't good. Lost a star on ending alone. That and I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie. Maybe it is listed as sci-fi and I just found it in horror but definitely more sci-fi than anything.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I enjoyed the journey of the story lines and characters. The harsh negative reviews I think are driven more by disliking an ending that isn't completely happy. However, I would agree that when each chapter switched between the first-person point of view either Tris or Tobias, it was easy to forget who's point of view you were reading. The two \\"voices\\" were too similar.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Johnson wraps you into the story of a man who breaks the mold of a society that dictates the path of the individual, and the non linear multi-narrator style keeps you yearning to hear the story from another vantage point.<br /><br />Totally worth the read.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is much more like the full-size HOG than any of the other faotd. I downloaded this a couple of months ago but taking my time with it.  It's challenging enough but the story line is so extremely wordy, and there is no &quot;skip dialogue&quot; button so I spend a good portion of the time just pushing through the dialogue.  Other than that, it's still fun.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|i can't hear the alarm even at the loudist setting.  if i can't hear the alarm it, it's not useful to me.
B007T8BYWE|4.0|Well worth the price - free but only contains one page. I like Flip Pixie puzzles but disappointed by the brevity of this one.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Just like all his other books that I have read,I found it to be realistically down too earth and very funny
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|One of the best comedies out there!  Both Mila and Justin were amazing in this movie and their chemistry rocks!  Simply hilarious!  You will find yourself laughing out loud on this one!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Book two of the trilogy is the best but Fifty Shades:  Freed is the next best Christian shows his true love for Ana. The story has some excitement and suspense. Plus the excerpt from Christians point of view is fun. Wish there could have been a little more of his point.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE SUITS!  Cannot get enough of this brilliantly written and cast show!  You can see the chemistry between all of the actors and the story lines are so clever!!!  Gabriel Macht is a gorgeous man and it's so much fun 'witnessing Harvey's brilliance!'  Once you own this,  you will catch yourself watching it over and over as I did!  :)
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I love this game. my husband and I love playing it through facebook. It's like our secret hideout when we are apart. lol cheesy I know but its alot of fun.
B004LWZW42|5.0|If you are an X-MEN fan like myself, you will love this one!  Tons of action, and having James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender in it makes this movie over the top amazing!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I really enjoyed the action and I can visualized Brad fighting to the end for his family.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|No real complaints here. Wish there was a weather station they pulled data from a bit closer to where I am, but that's about it.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Super new beginning of the Star Trek franchise.  This one is definitely a keeper for me.  If this continues these will definitely be worth watching
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I love Days Are Gone because for a week straight on my way to school, I would listen to this album every morning (and sometimes on repeat). When I first heard the album, an immediate 80's and 90's throwback came to my attention. These sisters are so talented. At one point, almost every song became stuck in my head. Overall, the album oozes of infectious sound.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|To be honest, I enjoyed it more on the big screen.  Maybe because I had seen it not too long before that it did not entertain me as much as  it did the first time, but I do have to say that  I thought the action and the special effects were awesome.  Good job!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is such a fantastic device! I do all my Netflix and any other app I can Chromecast. This thing just works.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|How can you go wrong with Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles?!!  I love to watch them interact as arguing, loving-each-other brothers as their world goes around with another group of supernatural thugs.  Very fun to watch!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a cool app. I hope they come up with more rooms soon. Some were hard but you can get the answers on you tube. I still go back and go through all the rooms.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|This is an interesting concept and I enjoyed watching it.  I was pleased that everything was not explained, because that usually means that there will be another season of it.  I'm glad.
B003JH8LPW|2.0|Not what I had hoped it would be. The characters were flat and one dimensional, I really had no empathy for anyone in this book. The whole computer jargon laden book made me feel like I was reading an assigned book back in high school, one I did not much care for but was obliged to finish non the less.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive game.  And the graphics are great.  I am a senior and I love games that require a lot of active participation.  This one fits the bill.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The only thing they need to change is the prices and it will be fine and have the balloon games free
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story starts a little slow but builds to a great book that's hard to put down. Makes you think what you would do in that scenario.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Micheal Buble has the smoothest voice out there right now. You won't be disappointed with this album! All the songs are good and you'll have it on repeat for the first 20 plays!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Good book to read! You should read it too! Lots of action! Lots of adventure! So start reading it now!
B00590JG0Q|5.0|solid story, acting, not overdramatic, but nicely told. good film. another reason subtitles are no bother at all, the films are quite good.
B00G9U7R2O|3.0|Boring and silly. But if you can tolerate that unlikeable one eyed character dominating the entire movie, you may be somewhat entertained.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|Most of the heroes in the comic book world are accidents, or some tragedy drives them, or they were born different and were ostracized for their oddities, but Steve Rogers is a hero long before he ever became Captain America, and the exceptional performance of Chris Evans sells that. If there had been a moment of this film that broke from the era to include a line of dialogue that was post-modern humor, it would have utterly broken the back of this film, but thankfully screenwriters Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus (with a little help from Joss \\"God\\" Whedon in a few scenes) never retreat to modern dialogue tropes in order to keep the audience interested. They never make the film totally wooden or sullen either.
1781162646|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  One of King's best efforts.  Not a horror novel, but completely engaging.  My fourteen year old son even enjoyed it when he used it for an English assignment for a mystery novel review.
0316055433|4.0|I loved Secret History. I think she is a fantastic writer, develops her characters well, and writes an interesting well thought out story. However, I, like others, found myself skimreading after the middle of the book.  There were many many many many paragraphs that went on endlessly about some reminiscence that I just didn't care about.  Why the 771 pages? It could have been tightened up.<br />That said, I thought the first half was a solid 5 stars. Grabbed me and didn't let go.  Rushed home to read it and gave my husband \\"the hand\\" when he tried to talk to me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very happy with this game. You can link it to facebook and it can get fun against your friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have played this since I found it on Facebook and love it! So glad to finally have a version on Kindle to play :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|CHALLENGING AND FUN. Lots of levels to keep you entertained for many hours. Fun to play but beware it is addictive and will be hard to put down.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an extrovert parent with an introvert daughter, this has helped me embrace her unique strengths and not force her into societies mold.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This product works great. only downside is it only works with Hp. It would be better if it would support more printers, maybe in the future.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|What a great family movie.  I loved it and my kids loved it.  This is a movie that everyone can enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Hollaween so this is like the best app ever. When I play it it is so fun and not boring. So everyone should play this game and love it. Like I do.
B007N85POS|5.0|What a cute and fun game to have for the entire family.  I got it for our kids to play on their kindles when we are driving. But I love it too.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|made this one my ringtone... thought it was appropriate... love to listen to it... it puts me in a good mood every time.
1451666179|5.0|Absolutely amazing book.  Does a great job of explaining potentially unexplainable situations.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me introspective.  I love the style the book is written in too. Miss Bosh, you are a genius.
B000002U82|5.0|Almost perfect, wasn't a perfect copy. There were some minor inperfections in the copy. Wasn't any worse than some other copies I've ordered in the past.
B000002H97|4.0|great album buy it sounds great. didnt like metallica but this is a great album. dont really have anything else to say
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card wrote a magnificent  sci-fi book in 1984 which stood the test of time so well the Movie premiered in November 2013!<br /><br />The movie was true to the book.  I'd easily recommend this to other sci-fi, thriller, or military readers.
B006UG90RM|1.0|album sucks wish i would have known this before i ordered it. doesnt make me think of the great music they made back in the 80's
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Loved this prequel!  The cast, the action, the music.  Loved it all.  A great edition to the Star Trek collection.
0891419195|5.0|There is no better personal account of the war than With the Old Breed by E.B. Sledge. Sledge excels at describing the battlefield in terms of strategy, and gets right to the point and doesn't sugar coat anything about the miserable conditions they experienced.<br /><br />This book should be required reading in all high schools.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Hell this book is awesome. I don't know what to say. Just buy and read this book ten times. It rocks like nothing seen before. Omgomgomgomgomg
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a good time wasting game. Lots of different little games to play. Fun when you are bored and just wanna play a game.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Funny and entertaining. This book is a great read! I found myself laughing throughout the whole book. Definitely recommend this. Love The Oatmeal
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game...so glad it's finally on Kindle Fire! You'll be hooked after 2 levels. You've been warned.  I resisted as long as I could
B00992CF6W|5.0|But can u add more stuff like Redstone, flint and steel in creative and more mobs. If survival craft can do it I know you can to.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I don't want to give it any star stating I hate it when honestly I cannot be a judge of that for the following reason-  Apparently Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player can only be used in the United States. I live in the West Indies, Trinidad & Tobago to be exact and purchased this item only to find out it is not working in this region. This information should have been made available in the product information;
B000XUBFE2|5.0|How many times do we puzzle over all that coexists in this world and its people? Mr Zusak puts all this to paper with a painful beauty. Seeing life through death adds a singular poignancy to a classic tale that begins and ends with a journey.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm actually okay with how this book ends. The book becomes a little slow at times but picks up at the end. Each chapter is told from either Tris' or Tobias' point of view and I wish there was a little more distinction between the two. I knew this book was not going to be a fairy tale - I've known this since the first book and the strong focus on the &#34;Fear Landscape&#34;. Overall I thought this book was well written and provided a great viewpoint on how love can change someone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun, not repetitive,  play at your own pace, nice graphics. a good way to kill time on a rainy day..l
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it is both addictive and awesome. The best part is it's on Kindle!  So now US kindle owners can play the game that everyone is talking about.
B000FCK42M|4.0|A captivating and compelling read, and possibly an historical teaching vehicle.  Would have to check some of the claims about the history of the war on drugs, but if 50% of what takes place in this novel is true, then my eyes have been opened.  In any event, I'm inspired to find out more.  Now, as for the reading experience, it's right up there.  Characters are sympathetic, even the demons, details are interesting, and there is plenty of action.  Winslow is not only a good noir novelist, but a cultural student.  There's a bit of philosophy woven into the pages, too, but essentially, it is meant to be, and it is, a hair-raising, excruciating trip to the underworld and back.  Each character lives in his or her own private hell and they are all connected by a degenerated culture, all of which are described in terms that are shocking, yet appropriate.  Winslow convincingly impresses that we have no idea what lies beneath.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I was hoping to use it as I traveled to connect my iPad to the hotel television sets, however I was not able to connect because I could not enter the the passwords nor was I able to use my cell phone as the hotspot for both the iPad and Chromecast at the same time. If  it can be done, instructions to do so would be greatly appreciated.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm addicted to minecraft and on the Pc so when I went on a five week trip I was going crazy! but I got this app and I love it! I had it when it first came out and am really glad its been updated. kinda like being addicted to cigarettes and this app being the nicotine patches lol ( joking)
0792165020|4.0|I did enjoy the movie, but I thought it differed too much from the book. The movie arrived quickly and in great condition.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I appreciate different and this book certainly delivered that.  I am looking forward to the movie.  Hopefully it does the book some degree of justice.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It won't let it update. Facebook says it needs to update but every time I try to update it has no option
B00GJJXRKQ|5.0|I told myself I would never get into something like this at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then the wife made me sit down for one episode and well been hooked ever since.......tsk...... tsk.......
B004LWZWGK|3.0|First off I saw this movie when it came out in theaters and let me tell you it was so hard watching batman get beat up by bane but other than that it was ok. I did not like anne hathaway in this movie the reason is because she tricked batman and she's the reason why bane beat the krap out of him and then broke his back I almost wish she wasn't in the movie. I give it three stars because its a good movie but it is nowhere near as good as the dark knight was but there are some scenes that stand out like at the end when the police and the criminals fight each other and batman and bane are in the middle of it all I will admit that was awesome the only decent part.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|There are over 270 reviews of this album so I'll keep it short an simple; I own every Alice in Chains Album and I find myself replaying THIS one more than any other. TDPDH is an insidiously slow burn, but once songs like &#34;Hollow,&#34; &#34;Voices,&#34; and [personal favorite] &#34;Scalpel&#34; get into your head - and your CD player/iPod - good luck getting them out. I appreciate the 'old' Alice in Chains as much as the next guy, but this is ample proof that the newest incarnation can put out music that is rich, sometimes thunderous, sometimes understated, always worth listening to.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|I am glad I read this novel that focuses on privacy in the digital age and the threat to us all of too much information, quantification of behavior, and surveillance. The story was good and well written. My only issue is that it was rather heavy handed. Readers do not have too think or come to their own conclusions about the damage that would be done by TruYou, SeeChange, implantation of locating chips into the bones of babies, and other Circle tools. It is pretty explicitly handed to us. I give this book 4 smiles and 1 frown. Read it - it's interesting!
0385373791|4.0|I'm an English teacher, so I read everything. That being said, my students reacted in shock every time I told them I hadn't read &#34;The Maze Runner&#34; so I finally felt compelled to read book 1 when one of my freshman girls lent me her copy. I read it in two days, and immediately purchased the trilogy, which I finished in less than a week. Original? No. Exceptional? I wouldn't go that far. Exciting, fast-paced and &#34;just-one-more-page-before-I-go-to-bed-oh-crap-now-its-an-hour-later&#34; addicting? Hell yes. Side not for parents with &#34;reluctant readers' at home - Since I put the books in my class library, they are CONSISTENTLY borrowed and every teenager that has borrowed them raves about the books.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Have watched and thoroughly enjoyed Longmire on TV, finally got to read a book and found Walt Longmire to be as great in print as on the small screen. Not sure why the TV series found it necessary to add/omit and change characters though? Still, a great read.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Fun app to play, so far it's not too difficult. My only complaint is the camera angle is hard to adjust, other than that everyhing else is great!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an amazing book in which you can see life from a different angle.  August is a boy going into middle school, with a deformed face. You learn from bis point of Chris what living life differently is like. This is truly an amazing and well written book.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Wonderful movie. Don't believe the haters. Will Smith and his son didn't excellent job throughout the movie. There were moments of sadness, joy, and a little bit of humor.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is by far the best deer Hunter game that flu made. I just love how<br />intriguing the app is. It's a mixture of adventure and addictiveness. I would recommend this to anyone.
0316322407|5.0|Excellent price and fast delivery.  No problems at all as the book was exactly as ordered and my wife is enjoying the book.
B001Q9J4PG|3.0|I had heard this book wasn't all that great, but I've enjoyed Clancy's other works, so I was excited to read it.<br /><br />In terms of the tech, gear, and details, Clancy here is great. Very ahead of his time. But in terms of the story and the characters, this book left me wanting more.
B005PUUMK8|5.0|This 9-disc set pulls together Chopin recordings made between 1972 and 2008 by Maurizio Pollini.  Works included are the etudes, the two familiar sonatas, the ballades, the scherzi, the preludes, the polonaises, and the nocturnes.  Please note that this is far from a complete set of Chopin's piano works - missing are the concertos, most of the waltzes, most of the mazurkas, and most of the impromptus.  Play lengths on eight of the nine discs are less than 60 minutes, so the set is less of a bargain that it might seem.<br />Though Pollini has his critics, I found most of these performances to be very effective.  The sonatas, ballades, etudes, scherzi and preludes are all very fine.  The weak points of the set are the polonaises and the nocturnes, which could use more nuanced, colorful performances (Rubinstein and Pires are two fine alternatives for the nocturnes).  All of these discs were recorded in the same Munich venue, and the recorded sound is clean and clear.<br />Overall this is a fine set and admirers of Pollini need not hesitate.
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|Played this type of game once before, can't ever get tired of the challenge.  You learn new words...I guess they're words. I have yet  for look them up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|game is awesome :)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:):):):):):):)<br /><br />you have to get it I am 8 and I LOVE it my sister likes it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a great game.  Sounds are fun.  Matching is easy.  Addicting.  First time I've played on a tablet and is easier to see than on my phone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was very well written and it made it very difficult to put down. Highly recommend it! Looking forwards to the others in the series.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Overall I really enjoy the game it gets frustrating at times and makes me wonder if they keep rigging the game lol one thing that would be good would be being able to earn stuff like the lollipop hammers and other tricks to use when your in a jam. Instead of having to purchase it. Also maybe if the 're-up' time would be shortened to at least 15 mins which I think is more do able. Hey you got us addicted and made yourselves rich, least you could cut us some slack and reward us in return.
B002RI8ZPK|5.0|better than I remember them being when I read them years ago. im hoping more get put out as E books
B00GFOIUVQ|2.0|Graphics are solid, Everything runs smoothly. My biggest issues with the game however are the controls and the cluttered screen. The controls need to be more fluid. Maybe add a control stick to move instead of constantly tapping the screen. Also fixing the controls to throw Thor's hammer would be great as well, Maybe just add a button for it or make it a simple double tap instead of having to press two fingers on the screen. Even then, and bringing us to my next point, the controls are not always responsive and attempting to throw the hammer (and other things of that nature) works maybe half the time if that.<br /><br />There are plenty of levels and worlds to explore along with objectives to 3 star it, Which pays even more if you get them all. Plenty of replay value as well. Would love to see more levels get added though as well as a horde mode of some kind.<br /><br />Now what makes me so angry about the game is that there are so many Costumes and Hammers to buy. However, It's incredibly expensive to buy costumes without some serious grinding and in order to buy the hammers, You have to spend real world money on in-game Gems because that's the only way to get them. Sort of a rip off because they make it seem like it's easy/free to get them and it's not and that's such a freaking pain. Sort of ruins the game in my opinion.
B001TCNSOI|4.0|'Changeling' is labeled as a 'depiction of actual events.' True, but that doesn't mean it's totally accurate - far from it. Nonetheless, the film is still incredible and very incredible. Angelina Joie received an Academy Award for her performance, well deserved.<br /><br />The events took place in Wineville, CA. (later renamed Mira Loma to escape the notoriety that ensued) and involved three proven murders by a Canadian family led by a child abuser, possibly as many as 20. Christine Collins' son was one of the three. The perpetrators were from Canada, and all caught. The LAPD mistakenly asserted that a runaway found in Iowa was her son - Collins vehemently protested, noting important physical differences. LAPD Captain Jones responds by having her committed to a mental hospital; after her release Collins wins a lawsuit against Jones and is awarded $10,800, but he never pays. The adult male perpetrator is executed.
B00003CXCS|5.0|This one is very unique and beautiful DVD packaging. It comes with two DVDs with booklet information inside and could not complain.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Of games THIS GAME IS THE MOST AWESOMEST GAME IN THE HISTORY of games!!!! This game is epic awesome and cool you can even type in &quot; pregnant rhino &quot; an  It will make an pregnant rhino!!!
B00000ILDE|5.0|I love the Alien franchise, the first two are the best though. I got this DVD unaware of the awesome extrax they added to the film. I remember seeing this at the theater in 86, yes it was good; but it was lacking in a way. When I sat down to watch it the other night I was blown away. It includes twenty minutes of footage that was cut from the original theaterical release; and it doesn't leave holes in the story. You will get to see more of the colony on LV-426 among other material that was cut. I highly recommed bying this DVD, it is worth the price.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Really awesome movie!  Great for anyone!  My husband and I have very different tastes in movies and we both absolutely loved this one!
B00009MGR6|5.0|This is one CD that isn't for everybody, I love it though. Some say this is one of their weeker albums, but I disagree. I love all the songs on here except for 1, it just is bad. The rest of the album ROX, you have cool guitar riffs, lyrics that are excellent, and background music that will get you energized. It's one hard rock CD from the 80's that is too good to pass up.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|WOW!  How disappointing.  This was not at all what I expected from this movie and the reviews I read. Bummer!
B00EVW0VTI|1.0|This was a combination of Die Hard and a 70's left wing fantasy. A black president is building peace with the middle east countries because they really like us. It is the military/industrial complex that is causing all wars to make money(haven't heard that one for a while.)  The terrorist are not Muslims but unhappy former military, Secret Service, and (of course) white supremacists who hate the president (probably NRA members all).<br />Finally the Speaker of the House is an old white guy (conservative)who cooked it all up to become president. It's no accident it sounds familiar and you will see all the real life counterparts in it, as Hollywood wants you to.<br /><br />In the final scene all the countries of the world buy the presidents \\"Peace Plan\\", even though we just almost nuked them.<br />If I could I could only give it NO Stars... lot of action and computer generated special effects.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Wow....... I can't say enough good. This inspiring movie was done so well - with such conviction and grace.  It's a definite must for every husband/daddy!
B000FBFML6|5.0|These books are spell binding! I was so excited to read that she has written 4 connecting trilogies about this world and each book is 700-900 pages so if your a reading junky like me you can really get your fix! The world is fascinating and the characters are people you want to0 spend all of you days with. Great author and a fantastic adventure.
B006YC74E8|4.0|Awesome app and fun to use. You can truly make photos your own. You can add text and pictures on top of pictures. Great app and fun to use for ages 12 and up!

0670024856|5.0|I have to admit that I have not yet finished the book.  I must confess, though, that it is so well told that I had to scour the Internet to find out if the main characters really lived.  Now that I've discovered they are fictional, the knowledge does nothing to dampen my enthusiasm not just for the story but for the way Elizabeth Gilbert uses the language of the time.  I haven't been disappointed yet by anything she's written.  Superb!
1577314808|5.0|Awesome book!!!!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game is so good I would get it right now. I love this game. its so fun and easy to play.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I waited for this book for what seemed to be forever.  I loved the first two and this one as well.  I wish there was a happy ever after with children of their own but I loved the book none the less.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This game is great, I highly recommend you buy this, but there a few bugs and glitches. The multiplayer is very smooth and great as well.
0399255370|5.0|Not quite done reading this book, but it's worth purchasing!<br /><br />It is a great book to teach voice.  The crayons really share the reasons for feeling the way they do.  I adore illustrations that look like drawings from children.  You will find illustrations like this throughout the entire book.  This book should be part of your home and/or classroom library.
1476715904|5.0|Fantastic easy read!  Great story and full of emotion.  Colleen Hoover books are so smooth to read and hard to put down.
B00DW1WR14|3.0|The song Mind Your Manners as  first track released is a very misleading song which makes you think that the rest of the album is going to be as heavy-hard-punk as it is this song. Sirens is a beautiful song .But i don't feel the rest of the album is as strong as those two songs are. In my opinion the rest of the album seem  to be more than fillers than anything else. I am not saying that the album is bad or the rest of the songs are not good...if you listen individually ,they are pretty good. But all together along with Sirens and Mind your manners seem like fillers. Actually, it looks more a Eddie Vedder's album rather than a Pearl Jam album. I know we're never going to have another TEN or VS. ,but at least they should keep doing rock music more than folk-ish stuff.<br />Maybe i had high expectations for this album to be great. I like the art, looks like  for a heavy-hard-punk album. I feel they let me down ... still love them ,it's why i wanted to be a awesome record...it is just an OK .
B008JFUNYG|5.0|One of the best remakes to date,very bloody/disturbing,loved everything about this movie from beginning to end,regret not seeing it at the movie theatre,one of the best horror movies of the year,must see,must buy for every horror fan
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|Solidly funny show episode after episode. One of the most well rounded comedys on TV right now. Phil is the best.
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|EPIC. When the opening note was finally struck, the energy that was released from the crowd was as equal too what came off stage. They blew the doors off and then the roof! This now ranks up as one of their best performances ever and they got it all captured PERFECTLY! Hearing the show again and watching it, I was thrilled that what I remembered and thought of it, wasn't wrong. Have too LOVE it when a new concert venue opens up 15 minutes from your home in a Long Island village, that gets stellar reviews!!     The Paramount was PACKED and after the 1st note hit, they never stopped bringing it. At 1 point I posted a message to Facebook, which I really don't do, screaming, \\"TESTAMENT IS BLOWING THE ROOF OFF THE PARAMOUNT!!\\"  - MAKE THIS PURCHASE! You WON'T BE LET DOWN!!    * - KORN loved the sound, the energy from the packed house they came back a few momnths later! Limp Bizkit came. They Saw. They stopped the sho and said, F THIS..WE'RE FILMING OUR NEW VIDEO HERE! He said they would play the song twice, go crazy for the camera's etc....Megadeth played 5 months ago, and Mustaine was BLOWN-AWAY at the energy at the fans, how amazing the sound was, and how the size of the venue make it very personal for each band member and fan!     *Update- Came back too the Paramount December 3rd, 2013!!    2-20-15 - **Just Announced: Coming back too the PARAMOUNT in April - Testament w/ Exodus(!!!) - \\"Dark Roots of Thrash II Tour\\" ...(No word on if they're making a new DVD. If I here, I'll update.)
B008Y768XO|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much and cried at how faithful the dog was to the owner my heart was so touched by the dog.
B00DW475CC|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I wish the studio did a better job in remastering this classic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is a wonderfully fun game for anyone you will be delighted with the puzzles and well SUGAR RUSH as you try to make it to the next level fun for the whole family is what I would call it!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I am always looking for challenging match 3 Games with good graphics. This one has held my interest and is fun to play. So far, not too challenging but hopefully will become more so as I progress upward in levels. Give it a try!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|very cute and fun game for anyone who likes entertaing search games where you get points by finding gems and avoiding giant spiders and other insects
1594488916|4.0|The story was a bit repetative. Interesting, though. Had not considered that type of addiction before reading the story of this compulsive stealer of rare books..
B001ROZIA0|5.0|This is a good movie it is funny Romantic and silly Diane keaton and John Cusack Are So good Together In This Movie And They Look Like They Had Fun Making this movie Together And the Sound And Picture Quality Are Very Good
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|Fabulous!<br />I am So happy that i bought this box set.<br />Especially the Live in Athens!<br />Vinyls too!wow wow wow
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As usual, Grisham holds the readers attention and throws in some wild twists. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and can't wait for his next one. I am however disappointed that I bought early on Amazon only to find it has gone down nearly 50% before I finished reading it.  I won't make that mistake again. Grisham has plenty of money.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Love this app! Very easy to use and has great features. I don't have a smart phone, so the pics on my phone aren't the greatest. I take a pic with my phone and send it to my email. Then I just download it to my KINDLE and edit it!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|8l<br />I love this game.  I didn't want to stop playing.  I recharged the battery every night.  I'm ready for the next version!!!
032147404X|3.0|While this book is a good source of informtion, I am sorry to say my knowledge is so limited that I cannot make full use of its contents.However, I shall keep trying to learn from it.
B005LN5UOC|5.0|This is a great headset. I have to say that it is better then other ones I have. My wife always tells me I never answer her, and this way I can be able to talk to people as well while playing the game. Fits on all ears. Not to tight, but it also will not slip off while moving around. This is a must have for any massive game. Overall good product made well.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Took awhile for me to get into it....but really good and excitement the rest of th way through.... can't wait to read the next part.....
071815780X|4.0|Jamie's zeal and energy are contagious. I caught his show on one recent Saturday morning and was hooked. I set his show immediately to DVR every Saturday. I made his Steamed Moroccan mussels from that initial viewing, and they were great, my kind of meal. I then ordered this cookbook. If you are a Foodie and/or cook, then you will have almost all of the ingredients you need for this book.  I am an avid cook, and I am one with way too many cookbooks and plenty of ingredients. This is my first cookbook by Jamie so I have no way to compare it to his others.  I like that there are a lot of pics along with the recipes (although some of them I must say look sloppy and at first blush, unappealing); and I like the metric system used bc I use my digital scale all the time, especially with flour.  I made the coconut buns, uses coconut milk and self-rising flour, that's it; but this time I had the book in hand along with the DVR.  I halved the recipe as I do the first time I make something new. You put the 2 ingredients in the food processor, but it did not make a dough ball like Jamie showed he got.  It was wet paste. I had to keep adding flour until it made a cohesive ball to turn out--then I proceeded as one does in making biscuits, cut the log and put them into cupcake holders.  I had to note in my book to add more flour or less coconut milk, the measurements were off...and I weighed the flour as given.  That being said, the buns were now to be steamed in a bamboo steamer, which I don't own. But I do have a new digital Pressure Cooker with a Steam function, so I used that instead; and they cooked through and looked exactly as his. They tasted ok, like a biscuit.  Although Jamie DID mention to steam them 10 mins. on the show, the book does not say that--it just says steam them 'hard.' The cook time should be indicated in the book, too.<br /><br />A good number of recipes have many long lists of ingredients as others have mentioned, which seems hard to understand when cooking on a 15-min. timeframe...so beginners beware. It may be offputting for that reason. But all recipes are not so involved.  And each recipe page includes a 'set' of about three recipes to make in that 15 mins, not just one.  I just take out from each recipe page the part I want, no law says you have to do it all at once bc that's how it's presented. (I am serving the coconut buns along with my own fish dinner recipe tonight, call me a rebel).  That way you will get closer to a true 15 mins or less timeframe to have it ready for sure. I hope to try more recipes when time allows and return with updates if any.  So I hope some of this information helps you out.  (By the way, I use Jamie's Shepherd's Pie recipe found on Foodnetwork.com; it's a keeper, and I make it every winter).
B009ZM74F8|1.0|This movie is pretty bad. Even when it is science fiction, the story makes no sense and has too many flaws. The fights, although artistic, are very stupid. In short, watching the movie is a waste of time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this book rocks.it is sad and loving at the same time. It brought sadness and made me feel sweet inside. Please read!!😊
0804137501|5.0|An excellent book. Remote is well-written, short, no-frills non-fiction, full of practical advice and real-world examples from within 37signals (the company the authors run). Some will say it's repetitive, and I'd tell them you need to be when tackling the behemoth which is the traditional work environment. So well done, authors, please keep pounding that drum until everyone gets it.<br /><br />Interestingly, I was most surprised by how much wisdom I found in it's pages regarding the management and treatment of employees (whether remote or not). I can't think of a better book to recommend to any boss, regardless of whether remote working is 'an option' or not.<br /><br />Finally, reading this book has not only sold me, more than ever, to the reality that remote work will be the norm in our near future, it has also given me hope that employees will be empowered, like they are at 37signals, to do great, fascinating, fulfilling work.
0374531269|5.0|Great book, memorable story.  would recommend this to anyone wanting to be educated about a young soldiers life..great gift for the voracious reader
B00FEN000S|5.0|Giant Robots fighting Giant Monsters, its like old school Saturday afternoons again. Creature Feature risings again. that enough words ?
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A testament to how the lives of family, friends, and strangers can be so intertwined with or without the characters' knowledge.  The characters are believable and the plot continues to spin and turn as the story is told.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Hard to get into at first but stay with it. Once you get into it it will not disappoint! Great book
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Decent waste of time. Good looking graphics decent screen reactivity. Would give five stars but not fond of either having to purchase additional levels or waiting seemingly forever for them to open.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|There are no magic pills no magic exercise but this book will give you the best info to make that change ASAP
B0064W639K|5.0|One of the best Batman stories written. The artwork is unique as well. A must have for every Batman fan, as well as for those who want to get started in reading about the dark knight.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great read, entertaining and really well composed. I would love a true narrative of the events,but I am not very hopeful.

B003K16P3M|3.0|Awesome<br />Kept me on my edge of the seat. I was so<br />excited. Never saw the way it turned out
B006VJMZXY|5.0|Just love this author. Have read most of her books and can't get enough. Love the historical facts woven in with fiction. Love this part of history and Philippa Gregory just makes it come alive.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was very exciting and keep me wondering what was going to happen next. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B00CCX9DUG|5.0|This was a great novel to tie the cousins novels together. Every bit as suspensful. Great research intermingled with fiction. A truly gifted author
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Before I used this app my device would always have low memory. But now that I've found this app my memory isn't full anymore. My kindle is now free from memory hogging apps. Not only did it do that, its totally free!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Google Chromecast rocks - when it works.<br />It'll start out broadcasting to my TV and then when I want to see another movie or episode of a show, it will not show anywhere but on my computer screen.<br /><br />Nonetheless, you can't beat the price and it's got no monthly fees!
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it!!  I love Gideon.  I read this book along time ago and have reread it 2 times.  I don't know why I never reviewed it.  It was much better than 50 Shades.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I love this book. It almost always had me on the edge of my seat. I could never predict what would happen next and I could feel every emotion as if I were there myself. All I can say is this is a great read!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it, and most of my questions were answered.  I read this along time ago, I guess I forgot to review it.  I have read Entwined in you and thought that was just as good.  I'm waiting for Captured in you.  I can't wait, I'm glad the author decided to write a few more books in this series!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it it gives you different costumes. It is easy to get bananas on this game.this is not a waste of time opt money because it is fun and free.
B00594XOZU|1.0|The first time I got this app it was fine but then I accidentally deleted kik so now I tried to log in and make a new account but it won't work and now I look and try to get it back for the 7th time and it wont work because it says currently unavailable!!!!! Please fix the app
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|This historical fiction book is really good and I personally recommend reading it. I do believe some of our elected leaders in the US could draw some necessary conclusions.<br />There's a lot of change that's happened in Germany from the beginnings of WWII to the present. All through it has existed The Black Eagle Inn and those that are directly associated with it. I give kudos to the author on some of the subjects he's written in this book. If a few more years had been added to the time line I'm sure gay marriage would have been covered also.<br /><br />A copy was given for a fair review.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I read this book about every ten years and our situation seems to say the same. The war situations are all alike to those who haven't served and can never fully understand PTSD.
0545101425|5.0|When traveling I always get a book on tape and this book was wonderful.  The reader did a great job
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved every bit. I laughed, smiled and cried! It wasn't just an adventure it was I tale of a girl who is on the verge of finding herself, her real self.
B00G4CXHSK|5.0|This game is very fun. There is a good selection of weapons and costumes. I already beat all the levels, but my goal is to get all the weapons and costumes.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Playing the Angel, by Depeche Mode...2005. A great album from a great Rock band, Techno group, well...musicians. I understand that Depeche Mode's music is not for everyone, but if you are ''curious''  about DM music, this is a great album to break the ice...I bought it for just .1 cent...What else do you need for motivation?
1401938906|5.0|I've always believed that you can change your life by changing your thoughts & this was so much fun & it really does work!!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved this book it was so well written and kept my interest all the way a great story ......five stars for me
B00957T6X6|5.0|The most entertaining series I have read in a very long time. George Martin has created twisted plots that continue to surprise you
B000UBVITQ|4.0|This disc features only the entire quintet comprised of Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet, Charlie Parker on alto, Bud Powell on piano, Charles Mingus on bass and Max Roach on drums. If you want the full concert I recommend that you check out [[ASIN:B0094JXNES Complete Jazz At Massey Hall]], which includes the eight tracks where Dizzy and Bird leave the stage and Powell, Mingus and Roach take over (on one track it's just Roach on a drum solo). Not only does that album have the complete concert, but the sound is better and it has Mingus' original bass lines.<br /><br />I will confess that I like the sound quality of this release better than my first copy of this concert. And while Mingus' efforts at overdubbing are on this CD this is how the original album was released.<br /><br />Since there are no sound samples on this page at the time of this review you can listen to snippets of the tracks on the MP3 version's page at [[ASIN:B000UBVITQ The Quintet: Jazz At Massey Hall (Limited Edition)]]. The music is clear and the mix as good as can be expected considering the way the original recording was mangled (Mingus had the tape recorded under the stage floor). Obviously fans will probably opt for the complete album I cited above, but if you are studying alto sax or trumpet this may be the only part of the concert that you need. Certainly the energy of the concert are present on these tracks and the sound is a little more natural than the complete concert album that sounds over processed and sterile.
0399159347|1.0|The secret wasn't so secret. I knew it early on.  I read half the book and stopped.  In analyzing why, I decided the author just didn't make you care for any of her characters, an essential element of quality writing.
3899554914|5.0|This is a Xmas present for my husband but I will be having a few sneaky looks at this book myself. Brilliant read - interesting stories. Fascinating bikes. Love it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I am enjoying this game, it's different from what I usually play. I like getting the vampire to his victim and seeing who his victim is.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD and Samsung phone, and it works great on both. Very efficient app.
0316055433|5.0|I was so absorbed in Donna Tart's extraordinary new novel Goldfinch that four trans-continental plane trips passed by too quickly.  I fell in love with Theo who, like Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye, dispassionately narrates the extraordinary evolution of his life.  We assume that, like Holden, Theo was about to be expelled from school when a terrorist bomb explodes inside the Metropolitan Museum of Art and changes the course of his life.  The author artfully combines extraordinary events and characters - Boris the Russian drug dealer, Theo's deadbeat dad and his Vegas girlfriend, Hobie the antique conservator and the up tight Upper East Side Barbours (to list just a few)- and weaves them together to create a believable and vividly entertaining plot.  Theo's coming of age and wisdom are exquisitely voiced.  The insights into the international world of drug dealings and art theft are fascinating and credible. This is an immensely satisfying read.
B00902AKK4|5.0|I'm really having fun playing this game. It's very sweet, and the graphics are beautiful. It's quite challenging - I'm so glad the finished levels are available for viewing, and I love the rewind feature.  Tutorial was also good. Nicely done!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Both the wife and I absolutely love this movie. It is a great humorous and modernized (?) adaptation to the the Odyssey.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This desperately needs an update to accommodate for the already update through Google play. Other than that no complaints it's just outdated...
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is hilarious. My wife wanted it as a gift and that of course meant I had to watch it. Overall it is a great movie with some decent music and funny moments.
B006TX276C|5.0|I know what to expect with David Sylvian and he always delivers up to and over the expectation. He collaborates with the best to return exceptional sound and moods.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read this so many times and every time I am amazed and feel compelling emotion. This is beautiful.
B001VIMCW4|1.0|I hate post 80's bond films and want to see appropriate ratings for me. It is also stupid that I have to go through all this crap to rate something.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok first of all I love the app and all though they take a long time to update, but that's only because they have the different versions like , Xbox, pc, and the iPod to update also so those who rated 1 please stop complaining. Other than dat I rate this 5 because it's so fun and it's very entertaining.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Really beautiful book.  The characters stayed with me a long time after finishing it. Definitely not just for young adults.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This facebook ap works great on my Kindle Fire 8.9.  I love the ease in use, it is much easier to navigate than my phone ap.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Impossible to put down. A fascinating and brilliant exploration of an ambivalent mother.  One of the best books I've ever read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very happy to finally see it available on my kindle. I wish I could save up my lives. It has been fun seeing what all the hype was all about.
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|What were the critics thinking when they started saying this was a poor movie?<br /><br />Oh, yeah, they are a bunch of Democrats and Republicans ...<br /><br />The last time I enjoyed a good movie in the movie theaters was back in the 1980 with movies like Star Wars and such... back when the movie going experience was worth the $5.<br /><br />Not one single movie that I have seen of late has made me think that I should have paid the $12 of today's theaters ( before the popcorn and soda) so it is not surprising that people are not seeing any real value in the Theater presentations anymore --<br /><br />But this movie is absolutely worth watching... And to the critics that said Jayden's acting was subpar -- he managed to convey the nature of what the character was feeling and did so quite splendidly... better than the Harry Potter trio at this state of careers.<br /><br />First, this is a \\"Coming of Age\\" movie set in a futuristic setting with terror at hand. There are no fantastical aliens, yet... and it would be interesting to see the follow up movies to this one... there is bound to be as this was more of a foundation. Jayden's character is probably going to be in the mix.<br /><br />Usually where you have kids playing the hero -- it is absolutely rediculous -- see Harry Potter, and several of the Jurasic Parks where the kids are the heroes -- but here the kid is both reluctant to be the hero, determined to prove he can, and placed as the ONLY CHOICE to be so... this is NOT a Will Smith movie as he only played a supporting role -- this is a Jayden Smith movie and shows that he is growing as good in acting now as he was in Karate Kid... he will be on par with many top actors of today's day, so long as he does not become another hollywood kid statistic.<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie -- Yes and not just to sci-fi-ers but to anyone who is interested in human endurance movies.<br /><br />Final note... I watch this via Amazon's Instant Video program for $5 -- andnot in an uncomfortable modern theater that can not maintain the glamour for a reasonable rate. worth every penny.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing on Facebook. Fell in love with this game. I'm so excited that it is finally out for the kindle fire. It is a fun game to pass the time
B00F91RYL8|4.0|it was good but I think it needed to be longer to really understand why this happened and to see the cure would of been good too
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|This movie is, for sure, full of action. A little different and more modern than the old time<br />Asian 'monster' movies. Three stars from me.<br /><br />Helen
6302610702|5.0|Great movie! I'm a  vhs tape movie collector<br />so happy to have make the god father collection a part of my on going hobbie!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I liked this, but started to get pop notifications that my KFHD had a virus, so I downloaded a couple of the free antivirus/antispyware apps and one of them said that Google search contained malicious software, so I've removed it to see if that solves the pop-up problem.  If I still get them, I'll reinstall it, as I do like the functionality of it, and try something else to remove the pop-ups.
6305428050|5.0|A classic B film. Anyone who wishes to have a good time watching a movie should watch Adventures in Babysitting. Absurd, slapstick comedy, good acting, and a well paced plot. Not an Oscar winner, but still fun.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|Rock guitar legend Ritchie Blackmore and his fair maiden (and wife) Candice Night return with their patented brand of Renaissance-inspired pop-rock.<br /><br />These are power ballads with a unique twist: They combine elements of baroque, classical, and minstrel music with contemporary fusion and are for the most part played with antique instruments that harken back to medieval times. Blackmore plays guitars and hurdy-gurdy, and Night provides lyrics and vocals and plays woodwinds. The rest of the band includes Bard David of Larchmont on keyboards, Lady Kelly DeWinter on French horn and harmony vocals, Troubador of Aberdeen on percussion, Scarlet Fiddler on violin, and Earl Grey of Chimay on bass, mandolin, and guitar.<br /><br />Of course, the band's chosen musical motif doesn't preclude Blackmore from breaking out his electric guitar and unleashing all manner of six-string virtuosity throughout the album. The medieval/Renaissance theme is authentic and done very well, but it is Blackmore's excellent axe-work and Night's modern songwriting sensibilities that tie it all together and make it accessible.<br /><br />Blackmore and Night make beautiful music together, both in real life and in the recording studio.<br /><br />(By the way, Night has a solo career in addition to Blackmore's Night. It would be nice to have a solo release or a few from Blackmore as well, focusing on his instrumental prowess.)
0783231032|5.0|Perhaps Speilberg's most underrated film. With Zemackias one of the writers, the humor and action flowed. It was one of the best comedies released in the '80's. I highly recommend this movie for a rollicking good time in the vein of the Marx brothers or Abbot and Costello.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I needed the length.<br /><br />I am producing a series of documentaries about the musicians and artists in my town. I have a Yeti Blue USB microphone that I want to use along with the other recording devices I'll have on location. The USB mic records directly to a laptop that I do not want in the shot. I needed to extend the USB cable quite a bit.<br /><br />At 10 meters this cable lets me get out of the shot and still provide power to the microphone.<br /><br />Problem solved.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I ordered these for my son who had an older pair and loved the sound. The delivery was very fast and after he opened it and plugged them in, I listened to a few songs and was very impressed.
1401917232|5.0|Even if you don't buy the fact that he's been visited upon by ascended masters; the message in Gary's book is beautiful. It just MAKES SENSE!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is one of my dad's all-time favorite movies, and I'm really glad you guys had it for a decent price. Thank you so much.
1433535734|5.0|This is a great resource.  Because of the detail of commentary, maps and related material it is quite large, not something you put in your back pocket.  I like to think that because it is the Word of God, that it should be quite weighty - as it reveals the truth of Jesus Christ, and He alone as our salvation. As a reformed believer and a big fan of the Reformation Study Bible, I was fearful that this Bible might advocate some views that I might disagree with, but that is not the case.  It goes out of the way to discuss points of disagreement among brothers and sisters in Christ, without being didactic. The scholars involved in this study Bible come from a number of different schools of doctrine, but there appears, at least to my mind, to be no dissension or desire to put one school of thought over and above another.  The maps are outstanding.  I am also pleased with the quality of the TruTone cover and binding.  I can write on the pages without it bleeding through, which is something that is important to me.  Lastly, the access to the online ESV program is a wonderful addition to the package.  Though I tend to be a Luddite who at times rails against the rise of the machine and technology over humanity, this is a resource I can highly recommend, and great asset to the total program.
067144901X|5.0|This is a Great book! My kids love this book and so I frequently give it as a baby shower gift.
1416549447|5.0|I always, always recommend this book, and I've run 15 marathons and a few ultramarathons, and I've been running almost 10 years.  It changed my running and I rarely get injured since reading/practicing Chi Running.  Just buy this and follow it, mostly the breathing, that's the most important part.  Highly recommended.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great graphics and just hard enough to hold one's attention. Will continue to play g5 games.<br />Keep up the great work.<br />Love these games.
B005MMZ63C|3.0|too bad we didn't feel the film didn't live up to all the hype as a classi. ? ! ?
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I cannot say I hated the ending, because I read reviews and knew it. Yet, I thought I I would have enjoyed getting through the story. I did not. As Allegiant unfolded, the entire series' premise fell apart.<br /><br />There are enough review. I want to say, disappointing.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I'm not a regular movie reviewer but I thought this movie, I had to write something about it.  Tough Denzel is whom I would describe as a functional alcoholic in my fantasy/real world, I assume he knows what is legally acceptable versus unacceptable.  The storyline seems to be simple but it keeps providing blind turns throughout the movie.  If someone asks me if he or she should watch this movie, I would say 'yes'.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Excellent journey into a fractured mind. The life of the Phlidelphia Eagles appeared to play a much larger part than necessary
B0056BU3I2|3.0|multiformat edition gives a digital copy on itunes AND vudu/flixster or universal<br />We don't do blu ray but the versions that offer digital copies are a better value than just purchasing the item in itunes<br /><br />The vudu/flixster/universal version is offered in hdx but even on a stronger internet connection, it may be too much to watch without interruption.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|its ok, but some of the levels are a lot harder then others and i like that.but  nobody needs to be on it  24/7 and you people are trying to get people on it 24/7 so so stop trying to do that it takes family time away and hurts se people. i know that your trying to get business and money i understand that, but just stop trying so hard...thanks for your time..
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|cant stop playing. lots of new enemies, new weapon and a bunch of new heroes. stages are also new and beautifully drawn as always.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I'll always be a Darcy fan, but Bridget has always been the character I'll follow anywhere. This book made me laugh, cry and feel like I wasn't crazy even in the midst of my craziest parenting misadventures. I think I can honestly say I liked it even better than the first two. Full of heart and hope and perseverance.
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|I liked his last album,&#34;Born and Raised&#34; better.  It had stronger writing and  more stylistic variety, however, if you liked his last one you will probably like this one too.  I do
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|this game is very easy to use my kids love it! I like that there are features that can be unlocked and you don't have to pay for them
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not too bad a game to pass the time good graphics, fun mini games, and cool looking horses. I enjoy taking care of the horse.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game and lots of different ways to get items you need to collect.  I just wish there were more ways to get bingo credits so you could play longer without having to spend money.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Could not put down once I started.  Glad I was on a three day travel with not a lot to do.
B008JFUNNM|3.0|It was a bit disappointing as there was no Long John Silver character and most importantly Captain Phillips was not made to walk the plank.<br /><br />These are very important points that drive the plot of any decent pirate movie.<br /><br />Finally the film could have greatly benefited by the hiring of Johnny Depp in order to have him reprise his Jack Sparrow character.<br /><br />Hopefully these wrongs will be put right in the sequel!
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Super game and really fun. I would reccomend it to anyone wanting to play pool. It is a definitly the best pool game out there to date.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|free and easy passes the time and does not require wi-fi to play.  I enjoy the different levels and it runs smoothly.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Beautifully written in two perspectives: the story of Sarah in 1942 occupied France (told 3rd person), and the story of Julia in the year 2002 (first person narrative).<br /><br />Julia is an American expat in France, a journalist who is researching the events of July 1942 in Paris.<br />Sarah is a young child who lived through those events, and her story is told beautifully and from an amazing perspective.<br />I was worried this would be a depressing read - and though not cheery by any stretch, it gives another level of understanding of the tragic and horrific events, without needing shock tactics or toying with emotions.<br /><br />It's real, and it's sad. But it's not for the sake of bringing the reader down, but for a heartfelt remembrance.
B008IYSMLY|2.0|Dexter went down after season 4. For me, season 5-8 were all filler seasons that did not add to character development and ultimately had no serious consequences to any of dexter's actions. If you want to keep a pristine opinion of Dexter, stop after season 4. I would go into details but I don't want to provide any details. It's like comparing Dexter to the ending of Lost. It was such a terrible ending that sort of destroys a show that we all once loved. Season 5-8 are like that for Dexter but like most fans, you will have to watch since your already so invested...
B00A2H9P98|5.0|I didn't see this in the theatre, but waited to purchase the DVD. I also have Olympus has Fallen, and while I love that film, I find White House Down to be more exciting.
B007EC27QM|4.0|This is exactly what I was looking for, with one exception. It has no square root function that I can find. Otherwise, it's perfect for almost all day to day calculations. Update that, and it's a 5 star for me.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Read: October 28, 2013<br /><br />This is the first novel I read of Kate Morton and it was such an enjoyment. It’s complex, delicate, intriguing, mysterious, suspenseful at times, and unexpected. There are numerous themes involved in this novel and therefore is multilayered. Author offers beautiful description, entranced in the moment. The author is a master in describing the scene enriched with emotions and one's perceptions, which render the scenes magical, suspended,and a paused feeling. This is a story about love, friendship, fate, obsession, abuse, tragedy.<br /><br />I won’t give much of the plot but it all starts with Laurel, the eldest of her siblings, that witnessed a crime when she was 16 years old involving her mother. She is forever marked by this traumatic experience and decides to resolve this mystery during her mother’s death moments. It involves 3 people: Dorothy (Laurel’s mother), Jimmy (Dorothy’s fiance)  and Vivien.<br />The mystery and intrigue levels are significant because despite you having the facts all along, you still don’t know what really is going on and the end is an unexpected turn that you could not possibly have predicted. It reminded me a little of Tana French style even though is a different genre.<br /><br />“Never discount the possibility of turning up an answer none of the current theories predicts.”<br />Morton, Kate (2012-10-16). The Secret Keeper: A Novel (p. 311). Atria Books. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />The timeframe is set between WWII (1941), 1961 and 2011. The plot is not presented in a chronological order but is not confusing. The narrative is continuous and complete despite the constant backs and forths. The characters are complex, unique, wise. I became very fond of Jimmy.<br /><br />Several messages/topics are presented in this novel:<br /><br />1. From Dorothy : “Love, Laurel, that’s the only reason to get married. For love.”<br />Morton, Kate (2012-10-16). The Secret Keeper: A Novel (p. 234). Atria Books. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />2. “Good people do bad things,”<br />Morton, Kate (2012-10-16). The Secret Keeper: A Novel (p. 304). Atria Books. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />3. The danger of fabrications of ideas: sometimes we create these monsters in our head to harbor our frustration which could lead us to lose it.<br /><br />4. “Do you believe in fairness, that if we’re robbed we should be able to take something back for ourselves?”<br />Morton, Kate (2012-10-16). The Secret Keeper: A Novel (p. 340). Atria Books. Kindle Edition.<br /><br />Books mentioned:<br />. “Of Mice and Men” by John Steinbeck<br />. “Macbeth” by Shakespeare<br /><br />I recommend this novel. You won’t regret it. I just wished the end would be different in relation to Jimmy. If you are planning to make it part of a book club, I recommend discussing the characters. I may later provide my notes on that matter.<br /><br />YouTube video illustrating writing process of the author: [...]<br /><br />Reading Guide for Book Club: [...]ria Books.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally candy crush is on the kindle it I so cool I download it and it turned out that it<br />was easy I am on level 100
0694003611|5.0|Board book is great for reading to my young son.  A classic book from my childhood to share with him.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it.I only wish it would be as good as OVER. Other than that it's the best game ever.
006202406X|1.0|I'm too old to read YA, really I am.  I've often scoffed at YA novels.  That is, until I picked up Divergent and read a chapter.  Loved it.  It was inviting to those of us who don't read YA.  I even secretly planned to go see the movie.  I think Veronica Roth is a good writer.  Anyone who achieves this level of success at a very young age is talented and has tremendous potential for greater work.  It pains me to write this review.  To say I was crushed is an understatement.  I don't like my main characters to die.  Supporting characters - yes.  My heroine - no.  It crushed the spark that kept me reading and wanting to see the movie.  I won't repeat everything everyone else already has written except to say that when an author extinguishes the hope of his/her readers, it weighs heavy on the readers' hearts.  I can't bring myself to see Divergent. It would be like visiting someone in an hospice, knowing they're about to die. I just can't do it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this app, A LOT I can't stop playing it and I think that any one ahs a possibility of enjoying it :) I SAY YES TO THIS GAME(approved by Lucy) :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game. It is very addicting. It does starts out kind of slow but once you get in to the higher levels you will have more coins. I am at level 201 and I have about 1600 coins. Once the prizes get up to 6 you can trade them in for more coins. Try it, you will like it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game but I keep getting stuck on the same level for days . At a time. Other than that I love this game!!
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Wonderful entertainment.  These kids have some serious camping skills and the movie overall is great.  The love story is perfect and the young actors did a great job.
B00005JKHN|1.0|Worked first time I watched it now won't play again.  Other DVDs work in same machine so it must be the disc
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game is relatively entertaining, I just don't like games that are nearly impossible to have anything good in unless you pay money. I hope that the greater  consider making more, cheaper in game items.
0385351399|4.0|I give this book one star for character development.  Also one star for technology savvy.  One star for the ending.  But somehow it ends up being more significant that these individual parts.  Eggers paints a frightening picture of a society run amok with data and the need to obtain more data.  I see this happening right now.  President Obama needs to seek refuge in a secure tent when traveling.  A judge in NYC has recommended that police wear cameras while on duty.  Online firms are posting mugshots and demanding ransoms for removal.  While the big data revolution will have great benefits to society, this book makes a good case for a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.  Recommended reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game rocks I just wish it had more areas to run in. graphics are amazing you should definitly get this app
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoyed this product. It offers Simple logic games. No time pressure. Nice way to take a little break from work.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Excellent book!<br />The characters are fascinating - I wanted to keep reading about Molly and Vivian when the book ended.  I couldn't put this down.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|I'm sure this would be great if this kindle fire edition would be compatable with my KINDLE FIRE!! what is the problem here?
B0098VXHBG|4.0|A different understanding of what may be part of the complex circumstances that result in a womans becoming involved in  the sex trade.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I started playing this game just to pass time but soon I was hooked. I love this game &amp; unlike other games the levels go on &amp; on. totally enjoying it.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Matthew Quick has written a tenderly surprising love story that captures the essence, if not the experience, of one man's negotiation with madness. Bravely telling the tale by crafting a compelling narrative providing the reader an opportunity to become gently immersed into a world where one can intimately share a mentally ill perspective. Clever without being ostentatious; charming without being maudlin. A fine read.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved this book.  Granted, there were lots of different characters introduced at the beginning but if one continues to read, this book unfolds beautifully.  The different personalities brought the story to life and one begins to feel as though they are part of the story.  The ending was unexpected.  I was sorry to finish this book.  I wanted to keep following these interesting lives and find out what happened next.  I hope to read many more books by Ms. Rowling.
B004OEMRGI|5.0|This is one of my favorite desert blues guitarists. Such beautiful music and incredible beats with astounding guitar playing. I never knew a calabash gourd could sound so good by simply being in a tub of water and being hit with a thong! Great stuff here and get the DVD that tells the story of the Taureg people.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wasn't quite sure what to expect, this was a free download.  As soon as I caught on, I was totally engrossed!  It was so exciting to find the clues and objects that helped you move along, turning keys, opening secret doors, waiting to see what's next.  Yes, agree that it was too short, I WANT MORE!
B003INBNXO|4.0|I wrote this review originally on January 2, 2010:<br /><br />I have no background in Wing Chun so I can't tell if it was authentic. But it did look spectacular (especially the chain-punching) and really got my attention.<br /><br />Good production and acting but the story has plot holes specially towards the end.<br /><br />Donnie Yen is a brilliant athlete and actor.<br /><br />Recommended.
B004L79VUI|1.0|Robbie Robertson releases an album after years of inactivity and its plain to see he sure didn't spend his money on songwriting classes.  This album is not only a disappointment but also damn near unlistenable.  You have to wonder what Mr. Robertson must have thought after listening to the finished product.  Couldn't have been \\"this was my best effort\\".  Don't waste your hard earned cash.
0385351399|2.0|To call this book heavy handed satire would be a compliment; this is the Atlas Shrugged of the digital era. Eggers bludgeons you with paper thin characters working in a painful cariciture of a technology conglomerate. As the book progresses, the characters become increasingly irrational, leading me to believe that the book is trying to make the point that living withing such a dull and ham-fisted social commentary is bad for your mental health.
B00BG5CXGM|4.0|Great looking case.  I like the TOUGH ARMOUR look a lot better than this one or I would have given it a 5.  If SPIGEN would have colors in the TOUGH line my daughter would have got that one.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|The game had a lot of challenging aspects to it and was very entertaining! I really enjoyed the graphics and voice-over work, pretty impressive for a point-and-click game. If you are into hidden objects puzzles you should definitely give this game a try!
B004FX6SV8|3.0|Its &#34;Almost unplugged&#34; as the title reviles, so it is a tweener between full rock and acoustics. Okay i guess but not one of their best
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I definitely would recommend this book.  Although the title us not appealing, the content is well written and very true to life. A must read!
B004A2V3K0|5.0|A great collection of sons from the band that put New Jersey on the map! The balance between new and old songs is perfect. A strong buy!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I've been waiting for legends to release for kindle for a while now and I'm not disappointed at all!<br />I'm level 5 now and still enjoying myself.  You make money by sea reading or selling to Myra and you complete writers with heroes.  It's different from castleville on Facebook in that it takes a little more attention but it's a good difference.<br /><br />*EDIT*<br />My husband just got home from work and we were so excited for this to be out for Kindle Fire finally that we jumped right into trying to download it on his.  The problem is, I have a KindleFireHD and he has a regular KindleFire.  This game is not compatible with his KindleFire so when he searches for it via the app store he doesn't even see it at all.<br /><br />The lack of compatibility for his device is what reduced my rating to a 3.  Now I have to play it in secret so as to not make him jealous :(
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is totally worth it. It has everything but I wish there were Endermans and<br />Christmas trees and pumpkins but it is totally worth it
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Love this product. When it is compatible with more apps I will give it five stars. For the price you cannot beat it.
B00ECR7KX2|3.0|Joss Whedon’s adaptation, as any modern adaptation of Shakespeare’s plays, reduces its inner dimension. It does not matter how well it is done and how well performed, Shakespeare’s “magic” is gone. It does not mean that the movie is not interesting, enjoyable, or entertaining.<br />Shakespeare’s plays were structured in such a way, that they apply to our current situations, and they do not need to be adapted. In their original set-ups their “magic” is more adequate to our present situations than it was at the time of their original releases. Our thinking patterns have changed and our understanding has been enlarged. Now our minds are capable of digesting evolutionary concepts that were too abstract to be comprehended some 400 years ago. These various concepts are encompassed within the plays’ inner content. But the plays lose their inner dimension when the original set-ups are not respected. The same applies to filling-in seemingly gaps in the plays’ plots. The gaps are intentionally introduced to force our mind to look for answers. But to find the answers, one has to break away from ordinary, i.e., linear thinking pattern. This is why, for example, having Beatrice and Benedick in bed prior to the opening scene of “Much Ado About Nothing” trivializes their relationship and the entire play. Shakespeare left several clues that allow the audience to figure out the true nature of Beatrice’s and Benedick’s previous encounter. The same applies to cutting off Dogdberry’s crucial line in his briefing of the watchmen. Without that line it is impossible to recognize his true role in the play.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|This Deluxe Edition re-master by Steve Wilson released in 2012 as a 3-disc set should not be confused with previous CD releases and re-masters.  As described in the details, the 3-disc set contains a re-release of the original album as released in 1970.  What first drew my attention to this release was the 5.1 DVD-Audio re-mix / re-master.<br /><br />Having now had the time to listen to all three discs, I'll not bore you with more accolades for the musicians, rather, I'm offering a critical review of the new previously un-released re-mixes by Steve Wilson in the traditional LPCM 44.1/16 format and in the DVD-Audio 5.1 MLP format.<br /><br />With respect to disc 1, I can't discern any improvement over the Polygram re-master which I already owned.<br /><br />Disc 2 is also a LPCM format CD with re-mastered tracks from the original album AND additional tracks containing alternate mixes from the original recording sessions.  Be aware, however, that the first two movements from The Three Fates, Clotho (organ solo) and Lachesis (piano solo), are omitted from the re-master, leaving only the third movement Atropos.  Also, Tank is omitted from the re-master.  However, 2 previously unreleased (and, in my opinion, less interesting) tracks were inserted in the place of the omitted tracks AND 4 alternate mixes were added including alternate mixes of Take a Pebble, Knife Edge, and 2 alternate mixes of Lucky Man, for a total of 12 tracks on this disc.  That said, you can certainly hear the difference in the re-master: way less distortion and much quieter background.  Well worth it just to hear a much \\"cleaner\\" recording of the original album albeit sans the missing tracks.  The addition of the previously unreleased material was a nice touch.<br /><br />Disc 3 is the most interesting (to me anyway) and the ultimate purpose of this set of recordings.  Basically the same re-masters (and same track omissions) and additional previously unreleased mixes on Disc 2, but re-mixed into 5.1surround using the MLP 48k/24bit multi-channel encoding method used for DVD-Audio recordings (a lossless method of 'packing' digital audio without using lossy compression).  There is no question (in my mind anyway) that DVD-Audio is the ultimate format for multi-track audio recordings...at least re-issues of digitally re-mastered analog recordings.<br /><br />Bear in mind you will need a multi-format disc player that supports DVD-Audio discs in order to play the DVD-A tracks (not to be confused with DVD-Video) and a 5.1 channel audio system to fully enjoy this disc.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Loved this so much after buying or a gift that my daughter will be getting one for Christmas!such a great deal.
0316204366|2.0|The author takes some good ideas and some interesting statistics and draws some questionable conclusions.  My wife and I listened to this audiobook during a long drive.  Well, no problem staying awake as we found ourselves talking back to the CD player after virtually every conclusion and comment from the reader/author.  Among the more outrageous and insulting comments was that Harvard decided to bring in less intellectually capable athletes to improve the morale of those Harvard attendees who found themselves surrounded by people smarter than they were.  The whole story around Catherine Saks was so riddled with inconsistencies, insults, and half-baked conclusions i gave up on it.<br /><br />I enjoyed Gladwell's other books and have been a consistent reader.  I had heard some criticisms of Gladwell's conclusions in other books but I thought they were well-supported by data.  The conclusions in this book appear to be straight lines between two data points.  The story of David and GOliath itself is a good case.  He concludes Goliath had a disease that made him grow and attributes all sorts of actions and ailments to him and applies them to the specific interaction with David.  Having occurred many millennia ago, I think we can agree that getting too attached to any details of the story is presumptive.<br /><br />The only reason for the second star is I believe he does introduce some interesting stories.  He just makes such crazy leaps from the data he has to the conclusions he reaches that it's hard to stay engaged with the discussion.  I gave up in fact.  My wife however, has taken the CD to her car and will undoubtedly be talking back to the CD player to and from the way to work for the next few days.
0345803507|5.0|cant help but love these books.  Only wish now that there were more than the three, haven't found anything else like it. Highly recomended
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such beautiful writing. I can't wait to see the movie. So vividly moving and inspiring. Such a clever choice of narrator.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was very intriguing in the beginning, but slowed at the end.  Still, an interesting tale of families and secrets.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Dearest Amber, you should read this book.  You are in it.  Your pain and suffering in the world is palpable.  I see it in your eyes, on your face.  It matters not what the ailment is.  Yet, as your teacher, I am not supposed to hug you, comfort you, or even befriend you.  What I can do is appreciate the real you and point you in what I think is a good direction,worthy of your time. Read each chapter knowing that you are loved, just as these parents loved their children.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Spoiler alert<br /><br />Anyone familiar with YA books knows that no one is off limits when it comes to killing a character(no matter how beloved). We got through Dumbledore and Finnick. Uriah was an acceptable death even though he was a great character.<br />But killing off Tris seemed so useless. What purpose did it serve? Did we really need to suffer through the last 8% of the book living out Four's misery?<br />I'll admit it, I like a series to wrap up everything with a little bow at the end. This is nowhere near that. It just feels so useless and I feel like the time I have spent reading this series was wasted.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|OMG! This movie is just great. The acting is superb by all. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a really good book and all, but a little caution is that all of your favorite characters will die , Prim, Boggs cinna ect. So yeah, i hope you can enjoy it.
B001JFZ118|2.0|I saw this on TV the other day.  The story is interesting, but there are so many things that combine together to make one of the most cheesy films I've ever seen. Queen playing during a tender moment that was supposed to happen 100s of years before, bad effects and terrible accents all make this movie barely watchable for me.  It's so bad it's almost good, almost.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|5 stars<br />You must own this game. Great graphics and gameplay is smooth.<br />Best deer hunt game of the year. Get it now
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Bought all three Minecraft sets for my daughter's birthday, and she flipped out :) Really nice, minimalized design that still stays true to the feel of the game. Maybe Lego will design/release some more sets based on other areas of the game's world.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King for a long time and I'm pleased that his works still don't disappoint. His books can still bring forth that restless feeling you get right before dozing of to sleep when your senses are on the verge of shutting down to recharge when suddenly you recall something you read in one of his novels and find yourself getting up to make sure that the doors are still locked. This feeling of unease and uncertainty is the magic that Stephen King brings to all of his books. Doctor Sleep has this effect and like it says in the book there's nothing to be scared of Sleep will make you Better.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Bought all three Minecraft sets for my daughter's birthday, and she flipped out :) Really nice, minimalized design that still stays true to the feel of the game. Maybe Lego will design/release some more sets based on other areas of the game's world.

B008P1EWIM|5.0|Has All that I need or want from a weather wise appreal,and simple format  .Love it! Do not need all the live actions and bells and whistles of other weather apps.Thanks for keeping it Real.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The series did a good job using fantasy to illustrate the terrors of war and the evils that are required to conquer certain evils. Suzanne does a good job in the end bringing about as happy of an ending as she can while at the same time giving her readers a believable and heart wrenching story.
B00957T6X6|5.0|As an e-book, this is well put together. You can navigate by books and chapter, and the errors are few and far between. It is also glitch-free, which is nice in any product you pay good money for.<br /><br />As a series, this is one of the best I've read. With complex storylines that always keep you guessing, this series is an excellent read. I can't wait for the last books to cone out. My main complaint is of the unnecessary sex scenes, but if you can get past those, it's well worth your time. I'd recommend it to anyone who can stand a little sex and Gore in their reading.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was addicted in 30 minutes and I love the puzzles. Just challenging enough to keep me interested, but not so hard I feel like I need a cheat.
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|Fun game if I could could get it to work past the first level. Finished the first level and the game stopped. working. Restarted twice and the same happens. Tried resume and still won't continue goes back to opening screen.
B0020M99LC|1.0|I grew up with Bond movies. I can't say I love them all, but they have certainly entertained me over the years.<br />I still watch some of the old James Bond movie with great pleasure. I can't say I will be able to watch this one ever again.
B00G32OER4|5.0|My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This was based on Ed and Lorraine Warren's past cases.  I have seen several case files that they have been involved in through the years. It was fact based and very interesting. It was thrilling, riveting and highly entertaining. I loved every aspect of this movie. This is the kind of movie that will be remembered for years to come and one I could watch again.
0992251656|5.0|I got this game knowing it would take a little bit to understand, but now that I'm used to it I love that it's so complicated.  The game is really involved, there are ways to take risks to make more money, or you can just 'mosey' about without burning fuel.  Like Firefly, the game is 'smart' meaning you have to pay attention to the perks and downsides of a job or a card.  It took me and my roommate about 2.5 hours to play our first game, but that included setup and several outbursts of \\"WHAT IS THIS DECK FOR?\\" You do have to look at the photos in the instruction manuel to figure out what are nav-decks, cards to buy from, etc, but it wasn't too bad to figure out.  Playing is pretty fun, especially when you're with another Firefly fan - our first game included Mal and Nandi as leaders with Inara on Nandi's ship, so the two of us joked around about her being there to make sure Nandi didn't have any contact with Mal, etc.  The first time we played, we excluded the more confusing rules just so we got the gist, and it worked fine, and after that we played with all the rules in place since we'd added a bit of new information (the rules we excluded the first time) to info we already knew (the rules we played by the first time.)  Sometimes it is a bit confusing - at least for the first game - as to what counts as a 'turn' and what doesn't, but the instruction manual explains it pretty clearly.  All in all, I see absolutely no negatives to this game and it's definitely worth getting if you're a Firefly fan - you can tell that it was made by genuine fans of the show, or at least people that paid very close attention!
0553374842|5.0|The writings of Kevin J. Anderson mixed with the art of Ralph McQuarrie makes this a must buy for any Star Wars fan. You'll love the back stories to some of the most famous Star Wars locales of the original movies.
B006IYFCIM|5.0|What a pleasure to read.  Dan Arieley continues to write fluidly, turning so many commonly-held notions about ourselves just upside down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bravo Suzanne Collins these books were so amazing and thought provoking...Excellent work of fiction! This is my second time reading this series all the way through...very good books!
0553384775|3.0|This somewhat entertaining cautionary tale recounts the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, aka \\"the Wolf of Wall Street,\\" who made and lost a fortune while having the time of his life.<br /><br />Jordan is quite a character--and his account of living large is a joyous chronicle of excessive excess filled with more brand names and descriptions of clothing than the average chick lit novel.  He has a knack for telling stories, and the stories he has to tell are often hilarious.  And the numbers are staggering--Jordan's children have a nanny who rings up a thousand dollar phone bill every month talking to her family in Jamaica and family members routinely rack up million-dollar American Express bills.<br /><br />Jordan is casually politically incorrect, using words like \\"Yid\\" in his anecdotes and even more casually relating elaborate stories of his second wife's sexual politics.  (Jordan is clearly in sexual thrall to her, but that doesn't stop him from availing himself of the services of a very expensive hooker named Venus.)  We get a very, very good picture of him, and as likable as he wants to be, he doesn't really engage us quite as much as he should.<br /><br />Jordan talks a good game--a really good game--but at a certain point, it feels like we've heard variants of his pep talks before.  When Jordan says, \\"I want you to deal with all your problems by getting rich,\\" we hear Al Pacino talking to Matthew McConaughey in TWO FOR THE MONEY; Gordon Gekko's \\"greed is good\\" speech in WALL STREET and a few other, similar exhortations from movies as disparate as BOILER ROOM, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS and other intense dramas about money.  The overall tone of this story is not dramatic, but comedic and there are moments when it clearly feels like the inmates are running the asylum.  The backdrop here is very entertaining.<br /><br />The description of the chaotic corporate culture just lends itself to movie scenes.  (There's a protracted sequence where a young employee is discovered cleaning his fishbowl instead of making calls that ends with him swallowing the goldfish.)<br /><br />We learn a lot more about addiction than perhaps we want to know and at the point where this story segues into a rehab chronicle, things really start to get rather familiar.  We wish Jordan well on his quest for sobriety, but we've seen this basic tale a zillion times before and this time ... we aren't all that interested.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of information about the way Wall Street REALLY works, and a lot of it is sobering.  (Jordan's explication of the way the NASDAQ works, for instance, is enough to sour any potential investor ... forever.)  This is all pretty interesting backdrop for the \\"arena,\\" but at a certain point, the average reader's eyes will start to glaze over at the details.  Suffice it to say that the \\"system\\" made it easy for Jordan to do what he did.<br /><br />The throughline of the story, however, gets a little lost in the big picture.  There are a lot of characters here and except for those who are important to Jordan (his, his father, etc.), they aren't really drawn with all that much detail.  Oddly, some of the very minor characters get ittle sections all to themselves.  (In fact, one of the best stories in the book has nothing to do with the main plot, but is an aside about a supporting character dealing with the \\"depraved Chinaman\\" of a cocaine dealing business.)<br /><br />There's a movie version of this book coming out soon and it'll be interesting to see how well it does. As a book, it has its ups and downs, but it does offer an insider's look at financial shenanigans that blew up at the end of the last decade and are still influencing the economy.cleaning his fishbowl instead of making calls that ends with him swallowing the goldfish.)<br /><br />We learn a lot more about addiction than perhaps we want to know and at the point where this story segues into a rehab chronicle, things really start to get rather familiar.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun, but my past experience with it on my LG phone soured my opinion when it stopped working after an update.<br /><br />The game gets boring at times so I don't pay it non-stop like my wife does.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Great entertaining, well written and easy read. Just when you think you have it all worked out the author puts in another twist. I loved the way she slowly unravelled the mystery keeping the reader intrigued right to the last page. Definitely recommend.
0810989956|5.0|I purchased this book for my 9 yr. old son per his request. He loves it!!! He's a huge fan of the Wimpy Kid books and just had to have this one. He already has it half way completed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is such an addicting game. I'm really glad that I don't have to go through Facebook or through my phone to play!
B000056HE9|5.0|One of my favorite wintertime movies of all time. I have it ready to go and with only a few more weeks until December, I will be watching it again and enjoying it all over.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game, but I don't like the fact that you have to pay real money to advance levels on Kindle Fire.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|This book is spot on with what I see in the office. Many workers are more productive working outside the office. However, managers think working remotely produces less even when there is evidence to the contrary. This book points out pros and cons of remote work and does a great job doing so. The book does a great job of showing that there has to be a shift in thinking and communicating to make working remote work. I highly recommend this book.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Sometimes difficult to read because of the graphic descriptions and the scenarios. But the masterful plotting provided an unforgettable payoff.

1451696191|5.0|Charlie is a fifteen year old who is coping with the suicide of his friend, Michael. To lessen the fear and anxiety of starting high school alone, Charlie starts writing letters to a stranger, someone he heard was nice but has never met in person. This book is in the format of letters and is like a diary of his experiences through high school. He also overcomes his chronic shyness and approaches a classmate, Patrick, along with his stepsister Sam. They become two of Charlie's best friends. This book represents the reality of an everyday teenager through Charlie's experience of peer pressure, mental breakdowns, and learns the true meaning of friendship from his mistakes.<br />  During the course of the school year, Charlie has his first date and his first kiss. He deals with bullies, experiments with drugs and drinking, and he makes friends, loses them, and gains them back. On the first day of school, Charlie makes a friend with his English teacher, Bill, who also becomes his mentor. He wants Charlie to exceed his potential and go further with his reading and writing, since he is an excellent writer. Bill gives Charlie extra reading assignments and essays. Charlie most likely has them done the next day or so. Charlie is somewhat socially awkward and doesn't know how to handle a situation. For example, the first time that Charlie saw Sam, he thought of her as more than just a best friend. Eventually throughout the book, Charlie gets a girlfriend that isn't Sam. One night all of Charlie's friends were playing truth or dare, and Patrick asked Charlie \\"Truth or Dare?\\" Charlie picked dare. Patrick dared him to kiss the prettiest girl in the room. His girlfriend and Sam were siting next to him. Charlie then leaned in to Sam and kissed her. This created tension between Sam, Charlie, and his girlfriend. This was very wrong for Charlie to do this in the first place because he never had any feelings for the girl. This just made it more awkward for Charlie and Sam. Charlie hasa relatively stable home, life, and supportive parents to fall back on. Charlie's Aunt Helen was special. She was the only person who understood Charlie. Unfortunately she died when Charlie was a little boy. It was Charlie's birthday and Aunt Helen went to go get him a birthday present. She was in a car crash and died. At the end of the book Charlie makes himself believe that he was the reason that Aunt Helen died. Charlie has a severe mental breakdown and ends up hospitalized.<br />  Charlie's final letter closes with feelings of hope: getting released from the hospital, finding new friends during sophomore year, and trying his best not to be a wallflower. Charlie hopes to get more involved in the real world, participating in life instead of just watching it fly by.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Amazing game!  Can't put it away. I find myself watching the clock for my new life. My kids were supposed to be the ones playing...oops
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book has left my heart riven in two.  I don't know if it is the the beauty of OSC's art, the intensity of pain and progress endured by his characters, or the longing to live a life that is one fraction as impactful as The Speaker For The Dead... But through most of this novel I wept.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an awesome and addicting game.  Helps relieve stress and is challenging.  You can get caught up in it easily and is a lot of fun.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Fun, easy to play card game. My daughter enjoys this as a quick game. Easy to play with 2-4 people.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|The movie was very obviously a hollywood production movie. It didn't draw me in at all. The president (Jamie Fox) said generic presidential things you hear in most white house based movies and was not a very believable character. Channing Tatum was cute but predictable. The overall effect was of disney family film, an episode of Scooby Doo, and the original Die Hard movie all thrown together in a blender. Overall, it just didn't work well and I regretted the $4.99 I paid to watch it.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Somehow I missed this Dan Brown book. Loved the look into the NSA. Suspenseful and enjoyed the technology side of the story.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Best game ever it is a creative game that brings back all the fun in scribblenauts. You should by it.
0767805712|5.0|If you are tired of people telling you your limits, you will love this movie.<br /><br />Humans have the drive to aspire, to reach for more.  That's what this movie show cases. The settings work with the intricacies of the plot, the small things are cleverly used in the larger story and the while the ending wasn't what I expected the scenes leading up to the climax were excellent.  I did notice more details the second and third time I watched it.
B0009U5DD0|5.0|The music was perfect for my fiesta party.  Lots of buck for your dollar! It was a great buy. Enjoyable music!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Once I finished oryx and crake --- had to read all three.  Beautiful, well crafted and integrated story.  Highly recommend.
B00006AW2G|4.0|Old, but good.  Probably Stones best album.<br /><br />But if you like the Stones, you should love Brian Jonestown...better than the Stones.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|I can't believe how many good reviews there are about this horrible film. I found the storyline so silly and oversimplified not to mention the backstories glossed over. And the acting. So terrible! And what's with the two main actors looking exactly alike? I couldn't stand watching the tough guys and their cowboy walk in ever other scene. Ooooh, I could go on and on.  The CGI is awesome though and thats fun to watch, but what a total disaster.
B00EE44Q7G|4.0|Big, big music. This artist is gifted with a fine voice and carries the music very well. My only complaint is that the selections didn't cover Verdi. I wished for more variety.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Basically a $35 YouTube (free) or Netflix (paid) streaming device.<br /><br />Device was fairly easy to set up, though you would definitely need a bit of a technical background.<br /><br />2 complaints:<br /><br />1) the shape of the device makes it awkward if you are plugging it into a receiver where the HDMI plugs are bunched together.  Not every manufacturer puts spaces between the ports!<br />2) It would've been nice if Google made the dongle even smaller, and designed the device to draw less than 50mA, which would eliminate the need for that oh-so-awkward USB power cable.  That tiny cable gets tangled up pretty easily.<br /><br />Other than that, the device performs exactly as expected - recommended.
0767919408|3.0|I very much enjoyed the historical retelling of some of these events. I did feel like there was a negative appraisal of some of events and characters in the book. I would rather make those appraisals myself based on a recital of history without the personal opinion of the author. I give the author great credit for the impeccable research.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Riveting! Once you start reading, you can't put down. The characters are very real and likable. Interesting, intriguing.  Makes you think about what is important - family.
0060191325|5.0|Reviews by Michael Ahern(10/12/2005), Sandra Peters(2/19/2001)--particularly about men being mind readers and the importance of reading together, Ronny(11/20/2009)--his last paragraph, Souljahs(12/29/2003)--still using it as a reference, Zev Saftlas (3/25/2004)--the cheatsheet, NVS(4/17/2010)--having zero insight into women, E.Johnson(10/23/2000)--the whole review, and Pristine(6/12/2008), particularly the last paragraph to improve relationship success, are all accurate AND because their reviews mirror my life experience.<br /><br />I first read this book after an ending of a relationship, which seems to be a common theme in the reviews.  When something goes bad in life, some people will have the courage to take a step back to learn what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again.  Most of my male friends still refuse to read this book, thinking that they can wing it and deride this book because only weak people will read it. Sure enough, they are still single or constantly complaining about their significant other.  This book will also help you in avoiding getting involved with the wrong person, as you will be able to see red flags more readily.<br /><br />Dr. Gray will sometimes have specials on PBS, which would serve as a great introduction to his material.<br /><br />It will aid you to get along better with both genders, regardless of where you meet them, because you will understand yourself and the opposite sex better, how to avoid arguments and increasing the other person's interest & motivation.<br /><br />Idealistic as this sounds, but the world would be a much better place if everyone read and applied his concepts.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Best game to pass the time in any waiting room.<br />Doctor's dentist or anywhere you have time to sit does take time to load.

0062107313|5.0|In \\"The Valley of Amazement\\" by Amy Tan, the author has, once again, written a fascinating tale of strong women as they search for true love through a series of heartbreaking and, sometimes, tragic events that test the limits of human endurance.<br /><br />For more of this review, please see:<br /><br />[...]

B00D8CSVLW|5.0|I enjoyed the book as it is well researched and all the people in the book are well rounded and come alive.
B008JFUPOY|3.0|Overall I give this a 3.5 star.  My kids loved this movie and for the most part I agree. It was cute and entertaining. It kept their attention throughout the whole thing. The nice thing was that it seemed to have some subtle lessons on values/morals in it that were good- No bullying, treat others the same as you want to be treated, do not give up when someone tells you that you can't do something (that you're a failure), and motivate others to do their best as well. The ONE thing that I absolutely can not stand about this movie was the ending. Now this is not to put anyone down in anyway, BUT I feel as though the movie sent the wrong message to kids.<br /><br />****SPOILER ALERT**** I will be saying the very end of  the movie so don't read further if you don't want to know.....<br /><br />The end of the movie has Scully and Mike W. getting expelled from college- after what they did that was expected. Okay fine, but what they chose to do after was to DROP OUT of college and begin work at Monsters Inc. in the mail room, then work their way up to different levels and finally making it to the jobs we know and love about them. This is not something I feel kids should think about when thinking about their futures. I EXPECTED them to go &#34;transfer&#34; to Fear Tech (which was mentioned in the beginning of them movie) and use that as their college education. Instead they say it's okay to just give up on college? Really? Today's age kids need a college education and to have these characters not even try to go to a different college was sad. I get that it is a cartoon kids movie, but there are still choices that children pay attention to and I don't feel this was a good one for my children or others to see.

1400052181|5.0|Wonderful easily read account of the history of Henrietta Lacks, her wonderful contribution and the sad situation that resulted in her getting little recognition or monetary reward for her contribution.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|As a writer and lover of fantasy, I knew that I would like this book. I just didn't know that I would read it all in one day, laughing and biting nails and generally fangirling over it. Rainbow Rowell's story of an introverted writer starting college is addictive and adorable.<br /><br />The characters in this book are fantastic, definitely the novel's greatest strength. Cath irritated and intrigued me in equal measure. Her introversion annoyed me, but I loved her loyalty, her insecurities, and her adoration of stories. Even as she avoided making friends, I found her actions believable, and I liked her despite her hermit-ness. I found the side characters just as compelling or even more interesting. Regan, Cath's gruff roommate, makes an excellent reader stand-in, shoving Cath out into the real world just when her anti-people attitude pushes the brink of \\"too much.\\" Wren provides good contrast as Cath's more sociable, reckless twin, Nick provides a fun mix of pretentiousness and earnestness, and extrovert Levi takes over every scene he enters with an exuberant sort of charm. The characters do sometimes teeter on the edge of being too witty and kind. Most of the time, Rowell saves them from flawlessness with character flaws and interpersonal tension, and I ended up loving all of the characters too much to mind their moments of slightly-too-perfect.<br /><br />The plot itself is great. Cath's struggle to fit in at school, her romantic troubles, her writing troubles, and her family troubles all interweave and hold the reader captive. In a wonderful contrast to most young adult and new adult fiction, the trouble in this novel doesn't outweigh the good times. This is a struggle, yes: a funny, interesting, charming, sweet struggle. More writing classes should be like Professor Piper's classes; more families should be like Cath's family (with all of its problems). As for the story within a story, I enjoyed Simon and Baz as people and as narrative devices. As a homage to Harry Potter and as a stand-alone story, they are delightful. I loved seeing these interspersed excerpts show Cath's character growth over the course of her first year of college.<br /><br />This book was adorable and delightful, and even months after reading it, I still find myself thumbing through it to find my favorite parts. It's a little dangerous, too: I found myself, after reading, wondering how I could write fanfiction about this story so I wouldn't have to leave. Worth the time!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A great story, well scripted, and especially well acted. Kept me on the edge of my seat. We loved it!
B006BY2DBI|2.0|I purchased this book on Kindle for my Shakespeare class. Some other students had the hard copy, so I was able to compare.<br /><br />The hard copy of this book is beautiful, and from what little I know, the choice to conform to the Folio texts was a great choice. Some of the plays even include alternate Quarto passages toward the back, great for comparison and for reading!<br /><br />However, don't buy on Kindle, not if you're planning on using this book for scholarship. There is a Table of Contents, which helps with navigation, but I haven't found a way to access the annotations and footnotes. Since I was buying this particular volume for research, I needed to buy a different book. For casual readers, this would still be a great purchase, but students, go with the hard copy of this book or another: reading Shakespeare without notes is not a wise plan.
B00CN3U8TA|5.0|I picked this figure up at my local comic shop. It's one of the best Diamond/Marvel Select figures and has a great sculpt that resembles Thor (Chris Hemsworth) from the film Thor: The Dark World. Great paint detail and application overall. This figure is slightly taller than the first movie Thor figure and stands a little under 8 inches tall. The cape does not weigh down the figure and it is not removable. Points of articulation include: bicep swivel, single jointed elbows, wrist swivel, ab crunch, legs can move straight forward and sideways, double jointed knees, thigh swivel, and ankle pivot. The head can turn left and right but the sculpt of the hair prevents it from looking up and tilting. Thor's hammer can be placed and taken out of the right hand very easily. There base is very detailed too. Overall it is a great display figure to add to your collection.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is awesome it makes you want to keep reading and is also a easy read, can't wait to read the next one.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|I have heard some friends telling of this w/ rave review so I decided to watch and get ready for Jan 2014's Season. I had a near marathon of catching up and enjoyed it quite well. I could have done w/o the homosexual aspects of one character that was in the first disc and the last disc, maybe of Season 3. It is a show that needs your full attention, I got very little needlework done while watching. :)<br />Now off to my daughter for her to watch and ready herself for Season 3. I would not recommend that my grandchildren watch, ages 12 and up.<br />One disc did stall but after trying a totally different DVD I knew it was not my player. Changed to another player in the house and it played w/o any staling at all.

0345404475|4.0|What does it mean to be alive? In Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the androids can be as intelligent as humans and the Nexus-6 models embody the next improvements. And they are certainly smarter than the “chickenheads,” humans whose brains radiation has damaged. But in this world, androids couldn’t empathize as humans could. In Star Trek, the Next Generation, the android Data sought to be human through the “emotions chip,” but here Philip K. Dick stresses empathy over other emotions such as fear and anger. A more interesting question, as suggested by the title: can androids dream? And can they reflect on the self and reflect on the reflection? Through this novel, Dick raises a question that, as technology advances, becomes more relevant. What define humans?<br /><br />A related question is the ethics of bounty-hunting androids. To the extend that androids are human, bounty-hunting becomes less legitimate. The police catch criminals and the courts try them before deciding on the punishment. To what extend do androids have rights to a fair trial? A broader question is what right they have? In the novel, they are only slaves and certainly do not have the right to liberty. And since organizations like the Rosen Association create these androids, is it ethical for these manufacturers to consider them properties?<br /><br />Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, like Philip K. Dick’s other novels is provocative and mind-bending and the reader would, after reading it, ponder on existence and reality. This is a great sci-fi read.
0553593544|3.0|Really dated. They have updated it the material for the movies but the books haven't stood up well to the times
1476727651|2.0|When reading the sequel to one of the most revered novels of its era, you have to be careful not to mistake what you WANTED the book to be, with what the book's faults actually ARE. Well, hopes and expectations aside, Doctor Sleep has flaws aplenty, and wrecks a recent win-streak by its author, who almost seemed to have returned to classic form over the last few years. Doctor Sleep isn't only a poor follow-up to The Shining, it's also a bad book in and of itself. Where Doctor Sleep failed was not just in a lack of a satisfying tie-in to its parent novel, complete with a scarcity of updates on people and places from The Shining, but in the scant updates he did give us, King repeatedly revealed things we did not want to know, and set in motion events we didn't want to have happen. Yes, it’s his book and his characters, but did he imagine we truly wanted to read that little Danny grew up to be the scum of the earth? That another major Shining character smoked herself to death and died young? Or that yet another perished forgotten and discarded by those for whom he’d done so much? This was not a trip down memory lane or even a stand-alone story, it was more of a dreary melodrama that constantly reminded me King first thought-up and then re-worked to be “about” his most famous 1970s novel.<br /><br />Dan Torrance in Doctor Sleep just IS NOT the Danny from The Shining, grown up, he's some stock character that gestated in King's brain until such time as King chose to give him a famous name (it felt like identity theft) and then fling him out onto the world as a down and out drunk. This book isn't even really about Dan, or the Overlook, or Wendy, or Dick, or Jack, or even about the usual thrills and scares of Stephen King's stock in trade, it's a laundry list of AA-inspired stereotypical situations an addict finds himself in as he descends into the muck of drugs and drink, and then finds salvation within a twelve-step program. Had King truly marketed Doctor Sleep honestly as what it is---a gross-out downer morality play about a drunk's life, with marginal jaunts into a boring group of psychic bottom feeders who torture children with pedophile-like glee---I wouldn't have bought it, and I doubt many others would have either.<br /><br />Perhaps it says much when I opine that the best moment of the entire 500-whatever pages came in the first quarter-hour of reading when the ever-dependable Dick Hallorann related a short story-worthy memory of his “black” grandfather’s reign of terror in Dick’s childhood. Yep, one good half-chapter out of dozens. I've read disappointing Stephen King books in the past, but this is the first time I ever felt swindled by &#34;Uncle Stevie&#34;. Yes, I'm sure I'm guilty of coming to this book with my own set of expectations, but never did I imagine Doctor Sleep would be such a bad reading experience.nestly as what it is---a gross-out downer morality play about a drunk's life, with marginal jaunts into a boring group of psychic bottom feeders who torture children with pedophile-like glee---I wouldn't have bought it, and I doubt many others would have either.<br /><br />Perhaps it says much when I opine that the best moment of the entire 500-whatever pages came in the first quarter-hour of reading when the ever-dependable Dick Hallorann related a short story-worthy memory of his “black” grandfather’s reign of terror in Dick’s childhood.

B005LAII3U|4.0|Total Recall Blu-ray this is a good redo of the Arnie movie.  I actually like this story better because of the lack of alien monsters.  That was not needed in the Arnie movie.  This story is centered on Earth not on Mars.  Good twist to the story with the journey and free fall aspect.  One thing I don't like in all these movies are the 90 pound butt kicking women who are throwing around all the 260 pound men like they weigh 20 pounds.  Seriously?  What happened to physics? How big is Colin Farrell? Not 260lbs but she was kicking his butt like he was a little kid and her BIG soldiers were cowed, whipped puppies.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This movie is extraordinary. The whole way through and through, you never know what's going to happen. Well written, directed, and produced. Denzel depicts the true life of what it may be like to be an alcoholic in how he deals with the world, people, and society; as well as himself. Heartfelt, heartbreaking, & moving!!<br /><br />I'm going to watch it again!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this castleville ... it's fun and you don't have to wait too long to harvest. And love the storyline... 5 Stars.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Installed with an MSI FM2-A75-E35 mobo and 8 GB of 1666 MHz RAM. Running with the stock heatsink w/o overclocking. The only game I've been playing is Rocksmith, and this combo has been performing great even in the large arenas with a few hundred fans.<br /><br />I was very leery of the integrated GPU, but it's working great, and it saved me $100 by not having to buy a video card.<br /><br />Win7 scores @ 4.1 GHz: Processor: 7.3, RAM: 7.7, Graphics: 6.9, Gaming graphics: 6.9, HDD: 5.9.<br /><br />If I was given the chance to upgrade my PC again, I'd still go with this APU setup. It can't be beat for the price, and it works better than I thought it would. Even if I had another $50 to spend, I would still go with this setup and apply the $50 to a new case or bluray drive.
B004S5C43E|5.0|I was introduced to Jeffery Archers books about 18 months ago and really enjoyed all the fiction books etc and started to get withdrawal symptoms after I had read what I thought was all of them. Then discovered  Paths of. Glory.<br />Not usually enjoying true stories? Anyway I bought this book and the way Jeffery  related it I couldn't put it down<br />We'll written and an excitement to read. GC
B00EVW0VTI|1.0|I thought Olympus Has Fallen was far fetched until I watched this drivel. It made OHF look like talented geniuses wrote and directed it. The story line was immplausable at best. The special effects in nintendo games are better. Channing Tatum has no place trying to be an action star. Go back to Magic Mike, that's your speed. America desperately needs new action stars but I fear we are too pansified to produce one.<br /><br />I thought the movie was suppose to be a action film but I think spoof movie was more what it turned out to be. The Rush Limbaugh character, the President attempting to be Obama, the obligatory right wing white extremists.<br /><br />On the plus side, the actor that played the lead villain was actually pretty good. I also like that they had the actor that played one of the psych skin heads from Breaking Bad.<br /><br />Save your money and don't buy this unless you want a spoof.

B005UT29Z0|5.0|So few films take the time to look at the current state of our country with intelligence and depth, but Margin Call is one of those rare exceptions that uses big name talent to explore these issues, and in some ways helps us to feel, in the end, that perhaps all is not lost. With the exception of the one character played by Simon Baker, the characters are not crooks or cheats or predators, but people trying to make sense of the situation they find themselves in and maybe achieve some redemption. Hollywood used to make films like this with much greater frequency, exploring meaty issues and situations to maximum dramatic effect (think Stalag 17 or The Best Years of Our Lives or even Casablanca).  In other words, drama built around meaningful situations where the outcomes really matter. These are the kinds of situations that make movies memorable, and make people want to watch the movies again and again because they show us people not much different from us discovering the heroes within themselves.

B00CRS88IO|5.0|I read some of the reviews, and I must say there is a reason the book has so many great reviews and only a dab of lower reviews. This story is action packed just like a James Bond movie. Are there a few inconsistencies in terms of historical plot references? Yes, so I have been told in some of the reviews, but Stevenson doesn't proclaim to be an historian and they really do NOT take away from the general pulse of the book. This story is a fun ride, highly entertaining and fast paced. I will definitely be back for more.
B0089LOG02|5.0|From the very first page this story led me along from one experience to another, teaching me things about life and human nature. I could not put it down. I usually don't like stories that jump from one time period to another but this time I liked the way the stories melded together. I highly recommend the book and will be looking for more of this author's writing.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I preordered this album and I ain't gonna lie i was kinda worried about how MMLP2 was gonna sound and when i got it I loved the CD and can't stop blasting out it's not as good as his first MMLP but it sure is a great album if your a fan of Em I loved every track never skipped listened to it front and back.  My favorite Tracks on the Album would have to be<br /><br />1. Wicked Ways<br />2. Bad Guy<br />3. Rhyme or Reason<br />4. Legacy<br />5. So Much Better<br />6. Stronger Than I Was<br />7. Love Game<br /><br />but all i gotta say is this is without a doubt my favorite Eminem album right now.
B00899E5B4|3.0|Much has been made about the hard-living lifestyle of Joe Walsh, and in promotion for this album, Joe himself has been quite open about the struggle of sobering up.  Essentially, 2012's \\"Analog Man\\" has been marketed as a celebration of Walsh's sobriety and new-found well-being in general.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I totally respect the notion that Joe Walsh has overcome his demons and feels as though he has a new lease on life.  The funny thing though is that, with this album, it sounds pretty much like the same old Joe Walsh you've ever heard.  The 'aw shucks' vibe of \\"Lucky That Way\\" is very much in the same mold as \\"Ordinary Average Guy\\", and \\"Funk 50\\" is an obvious and slightly 'modernized' nod to \\"Funk #49\\", to cite a couple clear examples.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album falls way short.  The 'confessional' lyrics on \\"Lucky That Way\\", which inescapably bring to mind similarly-styled stuff that Brian Wilson cranks out, are annoyingly simplistic.  The title track is a ham-fisted and somewhat cringe-worthy attempt at explaining how obsolete Joe feels in today's 'digital world'--it's not as spirited or as soulful as, say, David Becvar's similarly-themed [[ASIN:B00DBV07QC Obsolete]] from this year.  Joe poses the question, \\"What's wrong with vinyl?\\"  Well, yes, I will concur about the audiophile qualities of vinyl records, but on the other hand, they're big, bulky, and not all of us are multi-multi-millionaires with huge homes to store massive vinyl collections in.<br /><br />Musically too, the album is a mixed bag, considerably in part due to the presence of Jeff Lynne.  Look, Lynne has done some of my favorite stuff--for one, ELO's [[ASIN:B0000025DV Out of the Blue]] is, for me, one of the crowning achievements in all of pop music, and even his famed Traveling Wilburys sound can work wonders, as on the exhilarating [[ASIN:B00BU2QTUW Alright]], one of my favorite pop singles from the past 15 years.  But on \\"Analog Man\\", Lynne pushes his whole Wilbury-esque sound to a formulaic extent, riding it way too hard, most glaringly on \\"Spanish Dancer\\", where the rigid 4/4 tempo contrasts with Walsh's seemingly 'Latinized' guitar runs to an incredibly awkward effect.<br /><br />Walsh also hasn't given up on blatantly nicking some earlier riffs.  I already mentioned \\"Funk 50\\" where he's effectively nicking himself, but the rapid fire guitar line on the instrumental \\"India\\" is inescapably similar, if not almost identical, to the famous single-string guitar line on AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\".  And whether or not you can consider the thoroughly routine and dull guitar riffs of the blaring title track to be 'ripped off' per se, they remain just that--thoroughly routine and dull.<br /><br />Despite all the problems, the craftsmanship is generally respectable, as you'd expect from Walsh, and there is one fine ballad, the super-slow and surprisingly moving \\"Family\\", plus the pleasant pop of \\"One Day At A Time\\" (not too far from \\"A Life Of Illusion\\"), and ear-catching chord changes on \\"Hi-Roller Baby\\", the latter being the one track on the main album portion that Walsh had no hand in writing.<br /><br />All in all, it's hard to know quite how to sum all of this up.  It's no wonder diehards would have embraced it, given that his last proper album had been from 1992, and the pleasantly-familiar sound, despite the Lynne touches, is destined to give diehard fans little to complain about.  But anyone who can see the wood from the tress will quickly detect that this is hardly a stellar batch of new songs, and I was hoping he would have pushed artistically a bit more.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Another sad rewrite of a great movie cast in the white hating 1990s 2000s style with evil eugenic white guys as bad ones and the depth of character here hek even emotional range of superman makes the original seem shakespereian by comparision.  flat boring and so confusing cgi you can't even enjoy the fights....theya re all so obviously narrow screen camcorder or computer far away so you can't see detail.....barf  lois lane is lame  russel crow was only nice part....and was dismissed conveniently toward the end with 0 explanation... lol
B008Y5OW20|2.0|It's become an almost painful trend for veteran rock and pop stars to devote entire albums to their 'roots', which is basically what Jeff Lynne is doing on his 2012 all-covers album \\"Long Wave\\".<br /><br />I find that \\"Long Wave\\" fares particularly poorly on various counts, partly in the sense that, Lynne hasn't exactly been musically prolific over the course of the past 20 years, and \\"Long Wave\\" adds considerable proof to the idea that Lynne is washed up in terms of writing new songs.  I'd heard rumblings about how Lynne had a new solo album in the works long before it finally came out, and what he actually gives us on \\"Long Wave\\" is underwhelming to say the least.  Yes, he did do the 2001 Electric Light Orchestra album \\"Zoom\\" (yielding the soaring single [[ASIN:B00BU2QTUW Alright]]), which probably would have been more accurately labelled as a Lynne solo album, although a fair case could be made that ELO was, first album aside, purely a Lynne vehicle anyway.  I also acknowledge that Lynne has done production work, including George Harrison's posthumous 2002 album \\"Brainwashed\\" and Tom Petty's 2006 disc \\"Highway Companion\\".  But as far as bonafide new material, he's had remarkably little to offer, with 'new' songs typically being in the form of old/ unfinished tracks that were gussied up and tacked on to archive releases/ reissues.<br /><br />We get 11 songs here.  The entire running time clocks in at under 28 minutes.  That said, I'm certainly not saying this album would be any better if it were longer.  All covers, and hardly a brilliant song selection, as he opens the set with the interminable \\"She\\" (made famous through Charles Aznavour's version), and I hardly needed to hear him do the often-covered \\"Mercy Mercy\\" or Roy Orbison's pompous melodrama \\"Running Scared\\" either.  Basically everything is either an 'early rock & roll' tune, or something from what is known as the 'Great American Songbook', and all Lynne really does is apply his now-customary \\"Cloud Nine\\"/Traveling Wilburys sound to every single track, which might sound enticing for diehard Lynne fans, and admittedly, the characteristic massed vocal textures and occasional slide guitars do offer some 'ear candy' value, but really, this is damning with faint praise and the record just doesn't work.  The whole record strikes me as a trifle, and a royal waste of effort, at least artistically (not sure about financially).  Take his cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Let It Rock\\", for instance--it's basically a note for note copy, yet without the raw, kinetic rock & roll energy of Berry's classic hit version, and the extra layers of sound and Lynne's mannered vocal add precisely nothing.  Meanwhile, \\"Love Is A Many Splendored Thing\\" (with its out-of-place synth washes that sound like they came straight off the \\"Secret Messages\\" album) and the sickeningly sappy \\"Smile\\" get eaten alive by the slick production.<br /><br />When you additionally consider that Lynne did a less-than-steller job with his production work on Joe Walsh's \\"Analog Man\\", also released in 2012, it becomes highly suspect that Lynne is almost completely washed up.  Granted, he's got so much classic material already behind him that his status as a pop music icon is secure, but \\"Long Wave\\" is an incredibly forgettable listen from an artist who seems to have run out of things to say.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This insightful book sets straight---in academic and thoughtful writing---the historical  Jesus from the Jesus we know today. Historical:a disciple of John the Baptist,  a man who sought to overthrow the Jewish priests and their Roman masters, and whose promise of God's Kingdom in his here and now was responsible for his execution. Excellent summary of how Jesus was one &#34;messiah&#34; among many claiming the mantle. Present day Jesus:a creation mostly of St. Paul, who drained Jesus of his esssential identity as an oppressed Jew, and fought a losing battle against James, the brother of Jesus. So why did St. Paul's view prevail? His letters were circulated in the 50s. After Titus obiterated the Jews and the temple in the 70s, the letters were the only extisting connection  to Jesus. The writing about the political fights betwen St. Paul and James contain some of the best writing in the book. A must read for anyone interested in early Christinanity.
B00338QENI|5.0|Very interesting.  Sure opens you mind as to what the medical field uses for testing.  I read in the newspaper about a month ago that this book helped the family of Harriet's to be involved in what happen to her cells.  Plus it's interesting as to how many people became rich and profited from her and her family never new it.  There is a lot that happens in the medical field that uses peoples blood, tissues, cells etc.  and you never know about it.

B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a book of characters you loved to hate.  A story that got more and more convoluted and depressing as it progressed and ended in a way that made you question the goodness of mankind.  But for some reason I couldn't put it down.  Well written but frustrating.

B00F1W1SS0|5.0|I about gave this 4 stars, but when you think about the fact it's currently less than $14, that's a star by itself.  There have been some complaints about the sound mix.  I'll admit, it could have been better.  Not much on the low end and not as good as Budokan, but length of the footage makes up for it.  The bonus songs are also mixed in DTS-HD 5.1 and 2.0 which is nice.  I wish they had just mixed those songs into the main concert, but a minor gripe.  Video looks awesome.  It does bounce around a lot, but it's about impossible to find a concert that doesn't do that.  I would have easily paid another $5 for a better audio mix, but for the price, this is excellent.  And hopefully this price point will bring more people into the fold!!!
B0037472PM|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It had more red herrings and twists than any other book I have read.  The best thing about it is that you had no idea (well I did'nt anyway) of who the final guilty party was.  It did cross my mind earlier in the book, but I dismissed it as I could not see the how!  Up to this book I had been humming and hawing about reading any more of Mr Connolly's books as I found his first three hard going.  However he certainly hit his stride with this one.  I like Harry Bosch, even though he is certainly a very flawed individual.  Looking forward to the next book in the series, already on my Kindle.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I read this book for school and I loved it.. It was a really nice book. I think it has some connections to Jesus life..
006202406X|1.0|Were my expectations were too high because I gobbled up the first two books and the third felt like such a long wait?<br /><br />Have I finally matured past being able to digest YA?<br /><br />OR..<br /><br />Perhaps not all YA cash cows, ahem \\"series\\" need to be trilogies.<br /><br />If you haven't read the first two books in this series, please do! If you have read them and they got you super excited, please don't read this one. It will be a let down.<br /><br />In summary, nothing really happens. The parts that are supposed to be exciting are predictable and anti-climatic. Man, I just finished it and am just feeling so let down. After Book 2, I was so excited to see what would be outside the city... spoiler alert, you never really get past O'Hare (talk about a nightmare in itself). You have about a million \\"WHY?!\\" questions, none of which get poked in the slightest.<br /><br />The most exciting part involves first person narrative on what it's like to fly on an airplane. Maybe it was one giant product placement for Southwest? No, that can't be, Southwest safety demos are more exciting than this.. must have been from Frontier. First you take away cookies, then $100 for a carry on, now this?! You are my one true enemy, Frontier! Will you stop at nothing to rid the world of joy?

The game even gives a clue now and then to set you on the path to success.  Great time killer that won't make you feel like you're a tablet-game junkie (i.e. the game actually ends rather than throwing a bazillion levels at you).
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I love Grey's Anatomy, but 'seriously', the first 3 seasons were the best. Please bring back Burke!! It was depressing to see 2 important actors die, but at least Meredith and Derek are still there! I am enjoying how they are becoming parents. I don't know what they are doing to Bailey, making her soft and a little nuts. I do not like the new young people. I feel like they are trying to recreate the original group by adding a parallel group of young excited interns to mimic the behavior of Meredith, Christina, etc.
0307271080|3.0|I've read Adichie twice before and both times I was drawn into her big-and-yet-small, exotic-and-yet-universal stories.<br /><br />This book was different.<br /><br />Maybe there are some readers who like diatribes mixed with their stories. Not this reader. I find myself, time and again, just starting to ease into the characters when up would pop a blog post from the main character or a dinner party conversation and I'd suddenly feel like my channel had been switched and some fellow was standing there, ranting about An Important Issue.<br /><br />Had I been her editor (not that I'm worthy) I'd have cut all the rants and I'd have kept all the lovely pages where the characters experience the terrible cruelties of life.<br /><br />Just the small frustrations of a small reader: Please don't lecture me. Please don't preach. Just tell your story and all the rest will follow.
0062197266|4.0|I'm not easily creeped out, and this book had me locking all the doors and turning on the alarm when I was alone. Visceral and disturbing; a great read.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Thought I could show videos and photos from my computer but can't.  Also locks up a lot when viewing YouTube videos.
0738702994|5.0|These cards have excellent artwork and the book that came with them is very easy to use. They feel good in the hand and give you a mystical feeling
B008OE05IG|5.0|Very good documentary. And here you will see 17 more of the required words needed to finish my movie comment
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I could say so much about this book, I could write paragraph after paragraph about how much this book changed my life, but I won't. Instead, I am simply going to say this; pick this book up with an open heart and an open mind, it could potentially change your life forever.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Two fingers just doesn't cut it all the time.<br />Reaction times are okay, but you have to spend money to get the really cool guns if you want them.  Can still be played with defaults.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|If you are a lover of good music, then you don't need to miss this documentary.  Dave Grohl has long been an advocate for other musicians and using his high profile platform to elevate other musicians he loves.  He has an incredible grasp of music history and a great appreciation of those musicians and bands who have gone before him paving the way for him.  This documentary chronicles the story of on of the most influential recording studios in music history.  From early Fleetwood Mac, to many bands from the Sunset Strip hair band days, to Nirvana's Nevermind and Nine Inch Nails, they've recorded them all.  The music is great, the story is fantastic and the interviews are amazing.<br /><br />Long live Dave Grohl and his passion to tell the story of rock-n-roll to new generations of fans.  Great story.
B00005JLCI|5.0|My fianc&eacute; and I screened 4 versions of Hamlet in the last 4 weeks before this came out.  Saw this in the theaters. This movie avoids the affectation of Olivier, the mail-it-in from Mel Gibson  (Got to acknowledge the physicality Mel brought to the role, but other than that, nothing there).  It's a passionate love letter from one of the best Shakespearean actors/directors living, Kenneth Brannagh.  He has assembled a magnificent cast.<br /><br />A poem In light, color, words, and drama.  These actors inhabit the language so thoroughly that they can help almost anybody appreciate Shakespeare.<br /><br />I love Jack Lemmon (as does Kenneth Brannagh) but I love him too much to enjoy seeing him barely get through lines he is just unfit to handle.  He does cutely attempt to steal a scene  or two with a touch of movement, and it was amusing to watch the cameraman take him out of focus.<br /><br />The sexual scenes are pleasant looking enough and perhaps necessary to translate the passion of that age to these fallen times.  I remember hitchhiking across the country for love, and being truly thrilled to hold that ladiy's hand.  Passions seem to run a bit more coarsely these days.
B00DG86ARK|5.0|Brilliant Band with an absolutely brilliant performance.  The venue looks fantastic.  The sound is amazing and the band is spot on.  Anathema is one of those rare bands that can write hauntingly beautiful music with a heaviness that's unparalleled.  They have been on my bucket list to see live for years and have not been able to pull that off.  This Blu-ray will have to do for now.  All I can say is, if you're a fan of Anathema, then you have to own this Blu-ray.  Absolutely fantastic.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|A fun movie, especially for girls.  It has kick ass female heroines, romance, humor, personal growth, action. compassion. suspense and healing.  Great compassionate satire on our smart-phone obsessed culture, and on military thanatos instinct.  In the end everybody has to fight but it's the balance between the perceptive peacemakers and the strong, all out militarists that makes the future possible.<br /><br />Nice to see some real love on screen, a great way for girls to look at boys thoughts.  I look to see great things from these young actors in the future.
B002OSXDAU|3.0|I liked the story,it was written with great pain staking detail. The character's are complex and the writer does a great job of showing their ends by the decisions they make or the decisions that were made for them. A great read a lot of concentration is required to determine what the characters are saying.  TO THIN E. OWN SELF BE TRUE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Danny Torrance was a tormented child in The Shining who grew up to be a tormented adult here. Couldn't put it down as he faces the demons head on and saves another family from ruin in the process.  I purchased the immersion reading version and loved it.  Well read and the voice stays with you when reading as well.  Another Stephen King success! Can't wait for the next one!
1250012570|4.0|Eleanor and Park is one of those books that stays with you. Great story, characters and writing. I recommend to adults reading YA and young adults reading YA. Great book club book as well!
B0016BWACI|4.0|A very good movie for older kids. Younger kids can find the giant bugs scary. I can say I have watched it a few times.
B004XZR63M|4.0|Definitely worth a read, think about his opinions and make your own. It's a good book to get you thinking and highlights the importance of gaining financial knowledge.
B0016BPWNM|4.0|If you are a Bowie fan, maybe you'll like it more. It is good, though. The created world is a bit strange, like Wonderland.
B00B5HQL50|2.0|Every plot element in this movie could have not been awful, but they were. Every character could have been more than one dimensional archetype, but they were.<br /><br />I really do not have the desire to waste a lot of time on the review when the movie was so painful to get through. Just know this, if you want well written dialogue, a well thought out plot, or themes that are actually examined in a meaningful way that challenges anyone - this is not for you.<br /><br />If you want a movie that feels like a 3.5 hour long spoof of a crappy spy thriller, while having a run time of 2 hours and 24 minutes - Skyfall.
B00A0R0CG0|3.0|The seagoing gorilla is a bit of a stretch. If you like the other ones in the series, you'll like this one, too.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter loves this game and so do I. I actually play it more than she does lol. Thanks facelift.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I could not put this book down. The author intertwines the characters lives and in the end you understand how they all relate.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is an epic game but it is very iffy. It might shut down on you and it freezes a lot and loads for a very long time but I love it once I get to play it!!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|As a fan of Tom Cruise, I wasn't all that impressed with his performance in Oblivion.  The acting in general seemed to be sub-par from what I would expect for a movie he is in.  The plot was decent, but wasn't anything too exciting...most of it was predictable.  The visuals and special effects were well done, and the drones were pretty neat.  However, a sub-par plot and mediocre acting made me give this one 3 stars.  I'd wait for it to come on Netflix.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game!  I swore I wouldn't give in but I did and now I'm hooked!  Thank you for the game.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I stopped before the end just because I didn't want the trilogy to be over. Then I finished it and wished I hadn't. Sure, important characters have been dying throughout the series. But to kill off one of the main characters at the end was very disappointing. It's just like killing Linden in the \\"Chemical Gardens\\" series, or killing nearly everyone in \\"Game of Thrones.\\" Do authors enjoy having the power to do this?<br />I agree with many of the reviewers here, who expressed things that I agreed with but never thought of on my own. In particular, killing many likeable characters but leaving most of the bad ones intact, inconsistent behavior of several characters in the last book, and having to go back multiple times to see who was telling each chapter.<br />One argument I did not see (but have not read ALL the reviews) was that Tris represents Jesus, who was of course killed. No one ever explained in the books why she alone could resist many more things than anyone else.<br />This is another series where the ending in my head is different from the author's ending.
B004TACMZ8|5.0|This model was rated # 1 by Fine Home Building magazine a year or two ago, so I bought it to replace my Stanley model, which I didn't like. It has a round indicator which glows when you get close to something in the wall as well as an LED-type screen with a scale that helps find the center of the stud, pipe or whatever. The screen can be illuminated if necessary and the beeping signal can be turned off if too annoying (thank God).<br /><br />For normal use this model may be as good as these things get. But none of them are perfect, due I think to the nature of the task for which they are used.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Wonderful movie that I really enjoyed so purchased on DVD so I can watch at home.  Would highly recommend seeing the movie on a large screen.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I think this game is really good .  Well your playing your also learning some things you don&quot;t want to do.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|there are so many levels its so awesome. Really everyone can play this game.I play this game a lot. I think the monster car is the best vehicle.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|It's difficult to adequately summarize this album for anyone who's not familiar with this band, but I can say with high confidence that there is something here for everyone who enjoys Blues-oriented Rock.  This is a ridiculously talented group of musicians and their musical chemistry really shines on this album, which is a shame considering it was their last.<br /><br />For me, there are no filler tracks on this album, it is solid from start to finish.  In today's world of picking apart albums and selling them off as individual songs through digital sales I applaud bands who make albums like this one that stand as a cohesive collection of music to be listened to as a whole.  I could list my favorite tracks, but after looking at the tracklist and trying to pick out a few standouts it's nearly impossible, but I'd have to say the ones I just can't get enough of are \\"This Is Your Time\\", \\"Cry Freedom\\", \\"Afterglow\\" and \\"The Circle\\" but honestly I hardly ever put this album in just to single out one of those.<br /><br />As someone who's written several reviews here and has always appreciated a good track-by-track review of an album or at least the ones that dig deeper than just a 5-star review with brief comments as this one has turned out to be, I just can't bring myself to dissect this one.<br />Just buy it already and enjoy it!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME! I loved every minute of it. And although it was frustrating sometimes it really gave me satisfaction when I finally killed everyone and dominated the planet. THANKS GUYS!!! Ps. I'll be waiting for the next 2 special strands to come out, would love to try them out :)
B004H51706|5.0|I bought one of these for my nephew Dylan, who is a growing Land Rover enthusiast. I also bought him the optional winch. He spends HOURS playing with it- getting it stuck, and winching it out, playing in the sand pit- with optional gas or diesel 'broom broom' noises. It is the perfect size, has lots of neat features such as real suspension, opening doors, and steering, and has very good attention to detail. The only thing he didn't like about it was the lime green colour (never a factory option) so I painted the body blue with the roof in white. Though probably not best suited for little kids, it is ideal for kids 9-10+. Thoroughly recommended!

B006LSZECO|5.0|A very good read. A little hard to get into at first but worth I. Suspenseful and surprising at the same time.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I found this book difficult to read at first. Painful to read of the cruelty of the orphanage. But the authors words made me trudge forward. In the end I was rewarded with an excellent story that came together beautifully at the conclusion.
1416595236|5.0|This was a phenomenal novel! I'm so excited for the final one to be released! A great way to begin &#34;Rapping&#34; up the series.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|One of my most used apps on kindle.  Perfect travel accessory without having another extra item.  Easy to set up and use.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I have not read the book, but I could tell that, like most book-to-film productions, this film was truncated to fit modern attention spans.  Having said that, now I intend to read the books.  Woody Harrelson was great, as usual; Donald Sutherland looks like Chief Hanlon but acts like President Kimball, for all the Fallout nerds out there, and the other actors did very well, what with the screenplay obviously cutting quite a bit out of Ms. Collins' original vision.  Still very enjoyable; I just put this on because I couldn't decide on anything else to watch while I ate dinner.  It was gripping enough for me to continue watching to the end.  I have a feeling that the book had a much deeper emotional impact, particularly re: Rue, her relationship to the people in district 11, the boy Katniss left behind, etc.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something that goes a bit deeper than the mere sturm and drang of many movies these days.  I really think books like this should get a series on TV, just so that there is time for a clearer interpretation of the original story to be shown.  But, I have a day job, so the most I can commit to towards that end is a commentary on Amazon.com.  C'est la vie.
015204907X|5.0|This Australian classic was recommended to us by friends upon our arrival to Oz. My son was actually a bit old for it (5 1/2), but enjoyed it for a while nonetheless. We're glad to have been introduced to good, Aussie literature!
B00BU18U82|4.0|i am not an avid gamer so this took a little getting used to. probably someone with more expertise would find it boring after a bit. some parts are irritating but all in all i like it.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|Do not like it. Does not match up to the buttons on my phone. Have to remove case if I want to plug earbuds in.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|My kind of movie.  I was riveted.  I love paranormal stuff and I adore Vera Farmiga.  This was well acted, believable, had to be put on pause for potty breaks, no walking away.  I was not so scared I could pee myself.  It is not really &#34;evil&#34; scary, just &#34;mysterious&#34; scary.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very entertaining a good way to pass time.  Good clean fun for all my children.<br />I would recommend this to all users.
1592402038|5.0|See that you know everything in this book front to back before you attempt patient care in ANY way.  Spelling and commas can change SO MUCH in a report about patient care.  In the U.S., because of the huge influx of non-English-speaking physicians and some hospital requirements that everything be VERBATIM, there is often a lot lost between the dictating physician, the original transcriptionist, and the (perhaps East Indian) quality assurance person correcting the U.S. transcriptionist.<br /><br />To be awesome in medical transcription and QA:  You *must* have some intuition about the flow of the English language, some *knowledge* about what goes where naturally in terms of medical terminology, and above all know *where to place the punctuation.*  The panda eats, shoots, and leaves! is vastly different from the panda eats shoots and leaves.<br /><br />Please, everyone, get this right before someone gets hurt in a hospital.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|if you just let your mind wonder it i as fun as can be expected, just do not take things too serious
B00E9A656K|4.0|Very good drag race game but takes too long to build gold coins without purchasing with real money. Like the way you can accumulate fast money with the regulation race for new cars or better upgrades.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|cool. . . this movie was good.  the story was new and the characters were interesting.  only negatives was that we didn't get to meet the aliens. . . oh well
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Hard to find something new to say. True classic and a spectacular story for a reader of almost any age. Especially fascinating to read after having seen classic film.
B00AEBBAEU|1.0|300 positive reviews? and another 100 4-star reviews? no. . . no , no , no. this is a REALLY bad movie.  the plot is boring, the story draggs.  none of the characters are nice, let alone interesting.  the only value is a glimps into the early history of oil industry (who cares?). . . deffinatly not BD worthy.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This Facebook app won't let me sort by recent activity, only top rated posts.

B00F91RYL8|1.0|wow. . . real disappointment.  and a total fail for brad. . . what was he thinking.  zombies are the latest rage; but, it brought nothing but graphics to the table.  sure, the acting was fine and the plot was just as well.  that said, the characters are lame and the story is plain stupid.  even these people who claimed they liked it, I don't think they'd watch it twice.

B004MOMT2M|1.0|having high regard for this recording I was really hoping this would be a great addition to my collection of sacds, dvd audio, and blue ray audio discs instead what I got is a disc that sounds really bad<br />having a very good high end audio system allows me to really separate the good recordings from the rest I do not know what happened here<br /> what I can tell you is the 5.1 version of this recording sounds thin and like someone has added artificial echo to this thing anyhow I hope in the future rush will hire someone else to help them engineer their 5.1 recordings
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is fun and addictive a lot like other matching  games that we've had over the years I like the map of others and that u can give lives to others
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|so great to hear the Kings back at the top of their game... the opening slot for U2 has paid off in more ways than one... great album, every song... Temple is my favorite, but Beautiful War... Supersoaker... one of their best albums to date.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|Love this show. Spent the last few days glued to it!! Always exciting. Great characters... Love to hate 'em and hate to love 'em!!
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Growing up we all hear from our seniors how all these things were better in their younger days. Watching this movie made me realize I am turning into one of them, since the first thought that popped in my mind was &#34;Years ago there were more movies that were as good as this one and I had almost forgotten what this was like&#34;. So I guess the answer is yes, at least in what has to do with me and the movie industry.<br /><br />This film is one of the few in the last several years that have made me cherish sitting down to watch a movie. I have seen plenty of entertaining and thrilling films, but this one has no gimmicks to keep you enthralled. It is all about the story, the performances and the emotion. When the paths of two broken people collide, we get to see the best of human nature. Bradley Cooper is excellent in his portrayal of Pat, a bipolar that ended up in an institution as a result of an episode involving his wife and a lover. Now he is out and trying to get her back. But is Cooper's performance is excellent, there are few adjectives to describe the unbelievable performance of Jennifer Lawrence, who plays a woman whose life unraveled when her husband died. Both of them are trying to heal and finding each other may prove either helpful of devastating. There are many other characters that add color to this plot, such as the amazing Robert De Niro, who plays Pat's father and does so in his usual masterful way.<br /><br />This movie delivered pretty much everything you can expect to get when you sit down for the experience. There were laughs, touching moments, a story that kept us interested throughout, and actors that made us care about the characters. It definitely deserved its nomination for best picture, and in my humble opinion it should have won. This is one that you cannot afford to miss.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I recommend this book for every one. It's is a great read. I love the story plot. The ending was amazingly written
B007IXWL2C|3.0|if I had known how traffic the sexual content I would.never read this series, but I got hooked on the characters and relationships.  not knowing it was a trivially, I liked the ending of the first book, thinking she was smart to leave.  I did not think I would read the next two books, but l kept thinking about  ANA and CHris so I decided to read the other two.  I liked  everything except all the sexual junk.<br />I doubt I will read any more of authors books without first reading a review.
0756407125|5.0|waaaaaaaaaaaaay better than the game of thrones books.  Patrick rothfuss is the man.  Read the kingkiller chronicles.  Trust me.  :)
B00BATG18K|2.0|Where was the editor? While the basic thread of this story was interesting, it bogged down in tedious and lurid detail many times.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. It made me jump more than a few times and even squeezed a scream out of me. Parts of the plot felt like retread, but there were enough new spins to keep things interesting.  Ethan Hawker did a solid job as a writer so desperate for one more best-seller he moves his family into a home where the previous family died under mysterious circumstances and one child goes missing.  Before long his own family is affected: sons sleep walking worsens, daughter is communicating with a child no one can see, and his wife is increasingly anxious to leave.<br />The spin on the actual killer is different and fresh, and I really enjoyed how the movie ended.<br />Added bonus Vincent D'Onofrio is in the movie! I deducted one point because I wanted more screen time from him.  He was the professor/demonologist and two brief Skype sessions did not allow enough explanation of the origin of Bughuul.  Often these explanations and backstory are one of my favorite parts of scary movies, so I felt it was given short shrift.  That said, I found the movie genuinely scary

B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Great movie, interesting plot and original, has laughs and drama and a good love story.  Would watch again anytime period
B0002IQEHI|4.0|The Film deserves 5 stars, no critic, but Warner releases it cut on 3 sides, top, bottom, right, when my vhs of a TCM France tv screening shows more image in these areas.  Warner owns TCM, so why even in Bluray Warner doesn't give the full Vistavision image shot by mr Hitchcock?
B0012HQKZE|5.0|Classic Anthony Hopkins. In other words, thoughtful and well done with a twist behind a twist. No overwhelming special effects, just a good plot and wonderful scenery.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|The first book was so-so, but I had so many people tell me to keep reading the series...2nd book much better and now I am on the 3rd book and glad I kept with the series.

0307352153|3.0|I devoured this book the first time through.  Then, while looking more closely at some of Cain's resource material, I discovered an odd thing.  In her book, Joe Berghoff is held up as a shining example of an introvert who succeeded in sales.  Being myself an introvert who struggles with marketing issues, I wanted to know more about his techniques.  The only thing I could find was a chapter in the book \\"Cutting Edge Sales\\".  I was horrified by it.  Berghoff doesn't appear to have an introverted bone in his body. His problems in high school seem to have been entirely mischaracterized in \\"Quiet\\".  He's labeled an introvert because he's thin and wears glasses? Seriously???  In reality, he's extremely athletic; not an introverted characteristic according to Cain.  Berghoff's chapter in CES spouts the usual dreadful drivel abut how to get really really rich and famous by learning how to manipulate the people who watch 2am infomercials into buying whatever you're selling.  Product is irrelevant.  He would seem to be a shining example of \\"Cult of Personality\\", which Cain (timidly, I think) questions in her book.<br /><br />Berghoff isn't mentioned until near the end of \\"Quiet\\".  Maybe it's padding added by the publisher.  I'm sure there's an industry term for the practice, but I'm not up on current publishing tricks.  However this Berghoff section came to be included, it does cast a shadow over the rest of her book.  If I read it again, it will be with a much more critical eye.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I found the hunger games good and easy to read. I picked up the series after reading Game of Thrones. The dialogue of GOT is what makes it such a great series. The characters are vivid and their habits and mannerisms bleed onto the page. I feel that The Hunger Games lacked this detail. The story seemed to be linear, basic and focused. Not much detail was painted for the supporting cast. It is a good read and I did enjoy it, however I wouldn't put it up as one of my favorites.
1476727651|2.0|2 or 3 stars. &#34;I don't like it&#34; or &#34;It's okay&#34;? It's a tough call. I wasn't a big Shining Fan as many apparently were and are but I did look forward to reading a new book of his that didn't have anything to do with cowboys or whatever it is he's been writing about. I could see at a wrist breaking glance that it was the usual King tome - the man cannot edit his books - so I guess I can't fault it for what has become a part of who Stephen King is. Did I like this story? Not so much. Like often happens, his character's younger voices (regardless of their age) dominate the story so they all end up blending to me -- King falls in love with phrases and repeats them over and over. In Doctor Death it's &#34;bitchgirl&#34; for instance - and then there's that predictable assortment of old-timey phrases he always has everyone use, no matter how distinctly different each character is supposed to be from one another. I initially liked the whole Dr. Death concept with the alerting cat signifying when a person's time had come to die -- but that became a very small part of the book overall. I wanted the story to be over midway through. Cutting it in half and accelerating it might have made for a tense galloping ride. Not so much the 10,000 page book as it was. (15,000? 20? Am I close?)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I study the bible a lot and I've used a lot of software and this is one of the best I've seen. The audio was just icing on the cake.I'd give it ten stars if I could.
B006CUDDUG|4.0|1) Plot (4 stars) - Long time spy Alec Leamus has one final mission left before he can retire.  He is to infiltrate East Germany and bring down a counter spy.  But as he ventures deeper into the mission, he realizes that he has not been told everything, and there is a much bigger game being played.  It was a good plot, fast moving, and I appreciated how the narrative was pushed forward by psychological mystery as opposed to James Bond-like physical action.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Leamus is the grumpy old spy who has seen too much to believe in right and wrong anymore.  Liz is the idealist female interest who tries to bring him back to the world of love and morality.  The antagonists are a succession of German spies--starting with the naive, to the intellectual, to finally the hardened killer.  All were done well and were believable, but I didn't feel especially attached or moved by any.<br /><br />3) Theme (4 stars) - The Marxists in East Germany had their Grand March of History to justify the brutality of their spy game.  But what did the British have for a justifying cause?  Christianity?  No.  Capitalism?  No.  Hatred of Communism?  Maybe.  Wanting to win at a game?  Probably.  It's an interesting message about Western lack of idealism.  Especially considering the time it was written in.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - The writing was very readable, and even poetic and socially observant at times, which was an unexpected surprise for someone who thought they were picking up a thriller.  Moreover, Le Carre does something I haven't seen before--in certain sections he tells the story of the protagonist from a distant 3rd character, almost like a reporter interviewing people Leamus ran into after the fact to piece together what happened--and it work wonders for keeping the protagonist a mystery, which is what a good spy is.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - The dark, overcast, sparse world of the English lower class and the worker state of East Germany were done with great detail.  I definitely felt like I was there.  Though, strangely, I didn't feel as frightened as I would have if this was really happening.  I'm not sure if that was purposeful on le Carre's part, or shows a certain missing skill in his writing.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - I didn't love it.  But I liked it, and would recommend it to a certain type of person who likes Cold War history or spy novels.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I was ready to write this app off as a complete waste of time based on the first video I tried to load -- but thankfully, I tried a few more videos. Trying to find a functioning Youtube app for a Kindle is a pain, but out of all alternatives (sans rooting, naturally), this one is the best. Videos take 2-10 seconds to start playing, but that's about what it takes with the official Youtube app running on my mobile.<br /><br />If you have access to the real Youtube app on your device, disregard this app. It will be next to worthless. But if you're on an unsupported device like a Kindle Fire, this is a safe bet.<br /><br />NOTE: I created a throwaway Youtube account with only the subscriptions I wanted to watch on the Kindle - honestly, I don't trust third party apps with my real login info. I suggest you do the same, particularly since setting up an account and subbing to what you want takes less than 2 minutes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game with enough distinction between the puzzles to keep you engaged. The style is crisp and the theme is clever. The interface is easy to understand and operate.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This app can take time away from you. I love puzzles so if you're like me then this app is for you.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I had a similar app on my lap top this is almost as good although my Kindle is much smaller.  I'm enjoying it all the same.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|the interface not only sounds fantastic but looks great too. What’s more it’s solid enough to take on the road when you travel. The Scarlett 2i2 is much more than just a pretty metal box...
0060853964|5.0|Apart from The Book weaving añ interesting story, the humor, the wit, the overall delivery of the tale makes for fascinating reading!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Well, I just recently bought this game. I can't explain how much I love this game. It can vet really challenging too. I is perfect for any day. Also works great!!!
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Great production !  A, And, The, But, first, second, third, fourth, we, you, they, ernstwhile, meanwhile, dip deeply and bend double.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is sad but good because although you have to shoot animals which is the sad part it is fun to shoot things.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a great game for almost all ages. Try this game and see if you can do it without help. I recommend this game to anyone. You'll be hook until you complete all levels. Good luck.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Interesting tale that will challenge dogma about human ability and architecture. Well written and great story. Engrossing read, hard to put down.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game to kill time with. I love that if I have to I can leave the computer and come back and start right back to playing.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|It was perfect! No problems with this at all! It was even still sealed and I had no problems watching this movie!
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|I've tried it deleted it and downloaded it again. Does not work unless somethings wrong with my kindle. But game looks good
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is a Blu-Ray masterpiece.  Whether or not you like this movie, I do, this Blu-ray has one of the best combinations of 5 star sound and video that I own.  This is a high def. demonstration disk.  The colors, clarity, and shadow in the video will blow you away.  The sound uses all the speakers to perfection in the home theatre.  This will show the non-believers the possibilities of true high definition.  It's an incredible movie experience.  This is a GREAT Blu-Ray.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Oh my God I missed percy sooo much. This book is packed with adventures, mysteries, and a whole other side of God's you don't even know. You will love this book.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Better than I thought it would be. I got sucked in and loved it! On to the scorch trials I go!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Would like to see more opportunities for free boost and be able to save gift lives.  Very challenging and addictive.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I particularly liked this movie because it showed how even a person with defects as grave as drug addiction can still do great things.  It didn't have the happy Hollywood ending, but the movie was more \\"real\\" than most.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game is amazing, and free! But I will not given it 5 stars but until it lets me on Facebook. It will not let me sign in to Facebook. Please fix thanks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a great time playing this game.  My 8 year old daughter developed great thinking skills from this game.  We also bonded helping each other, I played on my kindle she played on hers.  We are excited for more levels!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|What a great, useful app. This helped me adjust my settings and selecy a better channel, improving my network performance. This is one of the most useful apps I've found. Well done!!!!
B003TSEL7S|2.0|This book was a sad imitation of the paperback copy. This book was to much about \\"love\\" and \\"feelings\\" than the action I know and love from \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\" and all the other Heroes of Olympus books. I hate the way text file translated onto the screen.
B00FFVML74|5.0|For those of you needing exceptional British drama while waiting for Downton Abbey to return, I'd like to HIGHLY recommend this series (8 episodes).  We just finished watching it via Amazon.com.  Excellent acting, riveting storyline.  It kept me guessing who the killer was until the very last episode.  I avoided it for a long time because I had read reviews that said it was very dark and disturbing, and solving the murder of an 11-year-old boy is dark, however the BBC didn't make it graphic for shock value.  They treated the story with respect, unlike a lot of American crime dramas that go for gross-out factor and &#34;jump&#34; scenes.  This story is about the effects the murder has on a small coastal community and the secrets of its citizens which are revealed during the investigation.  There is just no obvious motive for his murder, so therefore it's difficult to rule anyone out as a suspect.  The drama is so realistic that I was not aware I was watching a television show.  The brilliant  and talented actors look like everyday real people, not pretty plastic Hollywood types acting at being believable everyday people.  The emotional scenes, especially a few by the victim's father, are painfully realistic.  BBC dramas never let me down.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game, rather addicting, but wish there were instructions as to how to play the game prior to just learning it by trial & error!
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book and am waiting anxiously for the next one. Just a very original story, a very original world. I'd give it 4 and a half stars.
B00432QAKK|5.0|My boyfriend sure love it, I bought for him in our anniversary. Great tv show for a great price, thank you.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised! Talk about bringing all the characters together!<br />WOW!<br /><br />Funny, whitty, and well written.<br /><br />An exceptional film!
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|For all real Bond lovers out there, avoid this plodding trying to hard movie. They play some of the classic music, they have some good actors. But in the end the movie is ho hum and give me a bottle of rum to drown my sorrows.<br /><br />The story seems cobbled together. So good ideas seemly thrown together to make a story line. The villain appears and tells 'his' story and I left thinking who is this guy? So brief action tries to restore the effect and some nods to the classic movies, but in the end this is Sky Fail.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is AWESOME!  Once you start to play you lose all track of time. Definitely worth getting.  I highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Not happy with this game!  Crashed on my smartphone.  Also refuses to give me new lives to complete the daily challenges for the bridge between 95 and 96!  Thinking strongly about deleting the game from my kindle foo!
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|One day I needed something from my notebook app and it locked me out cause I didn't have the password even though I never set a password on it<br />If you know what to do please tell me!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Great Blu-Ray at a great price. I had been waiting for this movie to come on sale.  Worth the wait.
B009MF56GC|4.0|This is a great movie, all the greats are in this!! But I ordered blu ray and digital copy and only the blu ray was included! I returned it and got another one, same thing, just the blu ray. If I have to download a digital copy, Im not interested, I want it included. But the film itself is great!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book if you are looking for a quick read. I enjoyed reading it, but like with most Nicholas Sparks books, I felt that he could have gone further in depth with the characters in the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty cool.what makes it cool is:<br /><br />  -you can choose how you look, but it takes special items to unlock them<br />  -the more you run, the faster the speed of your running goes<br />  -you can get special power ups, like the magnet power up, which pulls coins closer to you<br />  -you can choose 3 types of clothes for your character, for a price<br /><br />This is a cool game, so people...buy this game =)
B005LAII4E|4.0|Spoiler alert!!<br /><br />Ok I am female so I was a little disappointed that my favorite man, Channing Tatum, was knocked out of the movie as quick as he was. It was ok but not as good as the first one.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|I don't ever write reviews, but I saw this film in the theater (despite myself)  and I must say... I firmly believe this movie represents all that is wrong with modern drama and Hollywood in general. It is formulaic, and one dimensional, It treats alcoholism and drug abuse like an after school speacial, and in essence that is all it is. To say that 'Denzel Washington's performance is strong, or in any way profound', is a slap in the face to any of your local community theater actors (where ever you live). He is just 'phoning it in'  so to speak. I beg you not to support this film with your $3.99. Lets instead support truly independent films. This movie is poorly executed, in so many ways and gives the audience very little credit. We are smarter than this S@#t! When we buy it they make more of it! Don't buy it so they don't make more of it! Uf you really must know how bad this movie is... just find it for free, but please I beg you..  don't vote for more crap like this with your hard earned money!
B007PVHMCG|3.0|For over $40.00 this product was a disappointment to me. My son the Minecraft fan loves it. I would suggest buying it if you can find it under $30
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I had recently read Cat Sense, and was planning to save this book for a later date. But I was ill and feeling pretty low, and looking for something to cheer me, so I picked up A Street Cat Named Bob. It is a sweet story of a man, somewhat down on his luck, who opens his heart to another creature, also down on his luck, and is repaid a thousandfold with a rewarding relationship with an extraordinary animal. On the way, he learns that he can find redemption by the simple act of giving to another. The &#34;Bobs&#34; of this world ask relatively little and bring so much joy. And the more selfless you are with them, the more they give. I couldn't help but root for James and Bob to flourish in a world that can often be cold and alienating, especially for those who don't take the safest or most predictable of paths. Bowen really lets you into his world, and the world of his dear inscrutable little friend. Everyone who is lucky enough to have had a special pet who has tugged at his heart will relate to the story of James and Bob. You can't ask much more of a book of this kind.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|As many others have already said, a great first album, can't wait for the second one.  I just want to comment on the sound issue, since the musical performance is a 10.  Yes, it's true that a lot of compression was used, but actually on professional audio equipment the sound is really not that bad. Part of the sound problem is because the mastering is pushed pretty hot and also the use of some added distortion and some funky EQ.  Some cuts do sound better than others (Tip Toe is actually one of the better sounding cuts). Actually, I have heard worse sounding albums than this one, but too many albums these days sound a lot crappier than they should, mostly because of goofy producers and A&R people.  From all the negative comments on the sound issue, I would hope that the producers and the record company have gotten the message and will do better on the next one.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|because it is one of the better dex's that i have seen, although i have read the book, but still great!!

B00FHAB3HW|5.0|Great album, I listen to every song on here. Songs are very entertaining and fun, better than other albums I've listened to.<br />Way to go Miley!!!
0812416805|5.0|This is a wonderful classic book. I chose this to replace an old copy that was falling apart. I was doing a report for college and used this for reference material.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|What can you say about an album whose every song makes you want to turn up the volume a little more?  I pre-ordered, and it arrived on the relaese date (thanks, Amazon!) Not a week into listening, and the songs are already in my head. The opening track (Revelation) begins with a nice, dark tone and opens up into a broad, full-throated piece sets the pace for hard, in-your-face tunes that continue through fading note of track 12. Track 2, the title song, continues with a dark intro and a pounding rhythm with scorching guitar.  It is the one I find most running through my mind.  Track 3 (Saved by Love)...good night!  A fast, aggressive track that grabs your face from the first note, smacks you hard with Michael's screaming chorus, and makes you reach for the volume dial again.  It ends in a frenzy of screams, guitar, and drums and without even letting you catch your breath blasts straight into Track 4, which is simply the best cover of any song ever.  Stryper takes the Doobie Brothers classic &#34;Jesus Is Just Alright,&#34; shoots it full of nitrous, and makes it hot.  Tim's bass really makes it all work.  When it slows down at the 2 minute mark, we are treated to the best of muscle-car '70s meets 21st century rock.  Track 5 (The One) is the power ballad, guitar driven rather than piano driven, it reminds me of &#34;Blue Bleeds Through&#34; from Michael's solo career.  Track 6 (Legacy) takes us to modern metal and a grittier tone to Michael's voice than usual.  The chorus is reminiscent of Twisted Sister from the Stay Hungry days. Track 7...again, good grief.  How can I keep my hands on the wheel when this song makes me start drumming along with Robert?  Once again, Tim's powerful bass drives it home.  This is a true anthem made to be heard in arenas, and with a lyric straight out of the book of Revelation it is picks up where &#34;Soldiers Under Command&#34; left off.  Track 8 is Te Amo, which is a bit lighter, but is still solidly in the Stryper vein.  Track 9 (Sticks and Stones) has it all...great message, driving sound, and even a bit of humor.  An honest song, it is one we can all relate to.  Track 10 again opens up with the wrecking crew of Robert's and Tim's drums and bass.  This one has me singing at full volume and would easily have rocked the '80s.  Track 10 (Sympathy) opens with severe guitar and Michael's trademark, full-chested vocals.  A great melody takes this one through the roof.  The final track (Renewed) is right in line with &#34;Blackened&#34; and &#34;Bleeding From Inside Out&#34; from the Second Coming album and even has a chorus that, intentional or not, has a clear link with John Donne's Holy Sonnet 14.  The whole album screams with Michael's and Oz's incomparable guitars.  The cover art, well, it is again, quite simply, the best album cover I have seen in decades of listening to music.  I keep staring at and don't want to take my eyes off it.  The piece that they used for the center of the tri-fold deluxe edition calls to mind Albrecht Durer's &#34;The Empyrean&#34; from Dante's Paradise.  Their pre-release promotion via Twitter and FB, with teasers released at just the right moments, created a fever pitch of anticipation for this album.  It deserves all the respect it can get.  Buy it  and then buy it again for someone else.  This is metal as it should be!
B00DCRE83S|5.0|I've been a fan of Jason Newsted since I picked up &#34;Doomsday for the Deceiver&#34; all those many years ago. I didn't really like any of his post Metallica stuff until now. The songs on Heavy Metal Music aren't particularly complicated, but they do have lots of balls and chunk. They sound great. Initially I didn't like Newsted's vocals, but they grew on my after subsequent listens.<br /><br />If you like big, dumb, metal riffs, give this album a listen.<br /><br />tk
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|If you enjoy hunting youll love this game! Smooth graphics...excellent kill shots reviews...slow motion kills show exact hit point...best hunting game for Kindle with out a doubt.

B00112ASXK|5.0|This Tinker Stallion is one of the very prettiest of the Schleich horse families, but I was surprised that it seemed to be the same size and a bit lighter than the Shleich mare. Still - super detail and very flashy.

B00DURHYWC|3.0|Venerable Portland cocktail party band has decided to take of its heels, put it's feet up, cover itself with an afgan blanket and watch the Lawrence Welk show.  In short, it's tired, shlocky and not-so-happy.

0805086846|5.0|I found this to be very readable, very Informative.  What an eye opener.  I'd highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in American Indians.
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|As others have pointed out it takes a couple listens to get into it. So give the major tracks on it at least 4 go's, and then decide.<br /><br />Reflektor is quite a departure from Arcade Fire's earlier works incorporating elements of disco/glam-pop and afro-beats.<br /><br />On no track is this more recognizable than on the eponymous title track. This 7 minute epic may be a little bit of an acquired taste. The first time I heard it I thought it was mediocre. After I listened to it a couple more times and watched the video (with it's incredible proliferation of reflective surfaces and perfect pacing) I was hooked. Along with Afterlife this track would make purchasing the album worth it.<br /><br />But there is more. The old arcade fire indie/blues-rock is still present and fans will immediately recognize strong elements of their older sound in other tracks like \\"We exist\\" and \\"Flashbulb Eyes\\". These tracks while I enjoy them don't really seem to fit and/or at least make this more of a transition album than a homogenous whole. I don't really mind that since an album that's too similar in style is often littered with boring throw-away tracks. While a couple songs aren't all that strong I consider this an album to listen to in its entirety, which is rare.<br /><br />As always the lyrics are not earth shattering but excellent in their own way. The theme of reflector is quite religious with numerous mentions of the `soul', the `afterlife', `heaven', `preachers' etc from the point of view of a disenchanted world-weary believer. This preoccupation with the spiritual may be informed by Régine Chassagne academic background in religious studies, however it has an urgent quality to it that at least resonates with me and makes me wonder is someone in the band dying? :)<br /><br />I'm a little bit frustrated that they seem to have gotten a little `big for their britches' but in the end it is about the hedonistic experience of listening to the music and from that perspective I'mglad to see that they're growing as a band and exploring new territory. I could do with less online advertising, guerilla advertising, tv advertising, radio advertizing etc. but you gotta hand it to their marketing team. Everyone is aware of Reflektor.<br /><br />The entire album is not a `must have' but the title track is definitely something to run out and buy in my opinion. Watch the video on youtube and see what you think.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the sort of story that stays with you. I look forward to the movie. However,  I fear it will not be able to do justice to the novel.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was really enjoying the book up until the end.  I didn't like how she ended this series - very disappointed!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|THIS GAME IS THE BEST!!! I LOVE IT!!! I CAN'T GET OVER THE MANY DIFFERENT FIGHTING STYLES AND THE MANY NEW AND DIFFERENT SKILLS AND ROBOTS!!! IS IT POSSIBLE TO GIVE THIS GAME 6 STARS!!!! :-D

B002LC8HF0|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has become my new favorite author.  I started reading him when he finished The Wheel of Time.  I love his style, his characters, and the pace which he maintains.  This trilogy has the absolute best ending of any books I have ever read.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game be cause I know it's going to last a long time  and it gets more challenging as you play also it has great graphics
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Joe Abercrombie has become one of my favorite authors.  His gritty, dark style reminds me of David Gemmell.  This book is Fistful of Dollars meets Enter the Dragon.  And it is awesome.

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|Awesome movie about our spiritual transformation that is taking place. Great visuals in the film for that.  Have watched it many times and always get a new message from it.<br />I went on to read all of the Celestine Prophecy books in the series. The Celestine Prophecy Experiential Guide was totally transforming and enlightening for me.<br />I recommend this movie and Redfleid's books to everyone who is exploring for clarity, purpose, and direction in their lives.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Generally, all of the actors playing Bond have been well cast, but<br />the films themselves used to be on the cartoony side, especially<br />regarding the use of the extras, who were always bustling about<br />pointlessly, especially when they represented minions of the villain.<br />The villains themselves were like the Joker in old Batman comic<br />books--overdone to a ridiculous degree. But the Daniel Craig Bonds<br />are much richer and more adult, with dense psychological subtexts<br />and far more realism all around. And Craig himself is, arguably--only<br />arguably, I repeat--the best Bond of all time. He certainly bears that<br />beaten-down yet determined as ever superhero feeling. There is one<br />problem in that the car chases and battles to the death are so tightly<br />edited and full of detail that you can't really see what is happening.<br />No spoiler, but at one point Bond and a bad guy are all over each other<br />on a tangle of construction thingies, with girders ripping through the<br />air and whatnot. Now one has the gun, now the other, now someone's<br />tangled up in rope...but you can't follow the progression from one<br />event to the next. It has the suspense. But it needs clarity.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Yes!  Each of the grandkids has their own charger for their Kindel.  No more battles royal over whose turn it is to charge up.  Great turnaround time, thanks.

I just wish there wasnt a certain number of lives you have to complete a level a because if it takes me 4 tries on one level, then i only have 1 more life to continue playing. Other than that it's an awesome game!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Free at game, very addictive but it keeps telling me there is an update but it won't meet me update.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|in my opinion  i feel this game is great easy and super fun to play and im sure all will enjoy it just like the rest of us
B00421IR5I|5.0|I bought this for my little sister, and she LOVED it. She had always been obsessed with the Petit Nicholas books. She liked the movie and I could hear her laughing about it for days.<br />I would really recommend it for all ages, and you can understand it even if your French is limited.
B0017XD3OY|4.0|great story. once again will smith does a superb job. 4 starts only because i thought that it could have been a bit more intense.
B0086700CM|5.0|monkie temple run l play because l play please and l wanto to from temple run you welcome and l she because
B00GFJ0NGQ|4.0|Good story. loved the series form the begging. i wouldn't say it is worth buying if you have cable,  but sense i dont have cable i have no ways of watching so i bought it. its kinda slow so far and could use more action and more of what the other seasons offered. thats why i gave it 4 starts and not 5.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|First of all let me just say that this was a very good film. It took the source material and gave it a serious tone that helps make the movie more enjoyable. The acting is done very well and the action will have you mesmerized. Henry Cavill far outshines Routh's portrayal of the man of steel. And Snyder does fairly well with Nolans influence. Again overall a very good film. Now, let's be honest, even those who absolutely LOVED this film or the man of steel will honestly have to admit it's not without its shortcomings. 1. While the somber tone is refreshing it does at times seem a bit forced. What felt so natural in the batman films is harder to recreate when you're main character is an alien that can fly and shoot heat rays from his eyeballs. 2. The action can be overwhelming. While done well, there are times during the action sequences, the finale in particular, in which everything is going so fast you nearly go cross eyed trying to keep up. And finally, 3. The film felt so uneven! This was my biggest complaint after seeing this. It felt like WB hired Nolan to do the first and second act and then for the finale just said: Ok Zack, smash stuff!!! The finale while spectacular felt so out of place when up to that point everything had been much more contained. But these flaws although notable, are not enough to keep you from enjoying the best superman film since The first one with Reeves, and will have you more than willing to \\"look into the sky\\" for the sequel!!<br />P.S. Did anyone else catch all the messiah references! Also, in the finale there is a quick nod to Lex Luthor's company Lexcorp.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I wish I had read this book first so I would've u n understood the formation of the Camel Club earlier.  Regardless kudos to Baldacci once again!  Fabulous entertainment!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I wanted to like this story, but ultimately I wasn't drawn in. Parts of it were engaging and then the storyline would get a bit odd and lose me, so I found it hard to follow in many respects. Perhaps this simply wasn't the right book for me, although I can see why others might like it. My disconnection was due to both a combination of the writing style and the frequent changes in the direction of the story.
B004TF3HSO|5.0|Beautiful album, made even better with remastering.  A classic that gets better with each listen, and fully enjoyable with zero knowledge of Italian.
B00B3VB9TQ|5.0|The story took an unexpected turn right from the beginning. Any other YA book would take the route of Tally being the one wanting to escape the pretty world. But instead Tally’s friend Shay is the rebellious one and Tally takes the pretty way out which left me questioning whether I wanted to follow Tally’s story or not. But then we have another unexpected turn and another… This story kept surprising me and I loved it all.<br /><br />But I didn’t like David’s parents’ motivation for starting the Smokey town. There wasn’t any grand idea behind it, it was all just an experiment.<br /><br />I couldn’t make up my mind about Tally. She tried to make up for what she’d done but she was making up a lie after a lie. And she wasn’t any good at it either. At the end she finally confesses to David but she also makes a surprised decision.<br /><br />This was a terrific read and I can’t wait to read the sequel.
B00G32VYDG|5.0|This was a excellent and fun movie for the whole family. The theme was a bit like Men In Black, but it has some nice uniqueness-es and twist that made it highly entertaining to watch. Movie also wasn't overly long ~93 minutes was perfect for a Friday night movie with the children.
B008Y5OWMK|1.0|I blind-bought this movie, and I tried hard to like it. But this may be the worst Criterion blu-ray I've seen, and I've seen most of them. It would be hard to overstate how dramatically aimless this film is. Let's just say that Cimino makes telling a story seem very difficult. And I'm not some philistine with no appreciation for experimental or plotless films. But a film has to give you something, and with the exception of a nice set, intermittently attractive (but frequently cloying) cinematography, and two enjoyable set pieces (a dance sequence at a Harvard graduation and a dance number at a roller rink), these are 216 very stingy minutes. If you're a film lover, you will probably need to find this out the hard way. But I kind of wish Criterion hadn't foisted this 3 hour project onto its fans.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />When Disney executives saw the finished product of 'Oz the Great and Powerful', a prequel to the erstwhile favorite, 'The Wizard of Oz', do you believe they began moaning at the thought of just how bad everything turned out? Or do you believe they were in denial about the weakness of the script, put on their happy faces, and declared that this was a masterpiece? I believe they weren't concerned with the answers to either of these questions. Disney executives are not stupid. They knew with some halfway decent digital effects and enough references to the 1939 classic, even an extremely mediocre script, would not sink them at the box office. And right they were! The new 'Oz' was a big success and they made gobs of cash.<br /><br />The new Oz reboot starts out in black and white just like the original. That's where all comparisons end. You can tell right from this opening sequence, that the magic just isn't there. Instead of 'Dorothy' and Judy Garland, we end up with the traveling circus huckster, Oscar 'Oz' Diggs, played by a miscast James Franco. Whereas the original had a compelling story about a cold hearted spinster who, under the guise of legality, expropriates a dog belonging to a heartbroken child, here, the protagonist's flirtation with the wife of a circus strong man, propels the protagonist into the dark, second act, fantasy world. While depicting the wizard as a womanizer may not kill sympathy for the character, the way in which Oz treats his subordinate, certainly does. Instead of a charming rake, Franco's 'Oz' is both part bumbler and arrogant materialist.<br /><br />Oscar's entrance into the world of Oz, incorporates the vehicle of the hot air balloon, so prominent in the denouement of the original. Here, in one of the many nods to the original Oz, Oscar is sucked into a tornado and ends up in a new 'Technicolor' universe. But it's way more than just the Technicolor of the original--director Rami's 'Oz' is an art deco wonderland, reminiscent of the digital effects in 'Avatar', featuring giant flowers and butterflies. Instead of a house landing on a wicked witch, Oscar's hot air balloon cascades down a waterfall, with Oscar miraculously surviving a near fatal plunge.<br /><br />While the digital effects are pleasing to the eye, once we meet the first character in the Land of Oz, everything is downhill from there. In the original film, Glinda the Good Witch was pitted against her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West. In this version, there are three witches: Theodora (Mila Kunis), her evil sister, Evanora (Rachel Weisz), and Glinda the Good Witch, played by Michelle Williams. At the beginning of the second Act, Kunis walks around with Franco with a completely clueless look on her face, as if she has no idea how to play the character. Feminists are sure to be appalled, as both Theodora and Glinda are doe-eyed for Oscar throughout the narrative (Theodora mistaking him for a wizard and Glinda admitting that she knows he's not the Wizard, but still can help defeat the Wicked Witch).<br /><br />Only later, when Evanora convinces her to take a bite of an apple, does Kunis morph into the more familiar evil, green-skinned wicked witch, and camps things up the rest of the way, battling Oscar and his minions (Weisz probably does the best acting of the three witches but her Evanora, is an unmemorable, undistinguished part). It might have been a better idea if Theodora and Evanora, were one character. Williams as Glinda is one-note throughout the film, echoing Theodora's earlier hero worship.<br /><br />In place of the dynamic sidekicks, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion, Oscar must be content with two allies who miss the mark: Finley, a witless flying monkey and the China Girl, a porcelain figure who Oscar mends with a bottle of glue. Oscar's act of kindness in healing the China Girl, might be good for young kids but the 'glue' scene goes on interminably too long for adults. The porcelain girl bonds with Oscar on a childlike level and ends up helping Glinda free herself from the bad witches, after she's captured and put in chains in Emerald City. Glinda in turn, neutralizes Evanora, by destroying her emerald necklace, and reducing her to an old crone.<br /><br />Unlike the original, where the Scarecrow, Lion and Tin Man, courageously attempt to save Dorothy by entering the Wicked Witch's lair and actually killing her, we now have the politically correct solution: Oscar assists the pacifist denizens of Oz, who don't believe in violence, by concocting a series of 'sleight of hand' magic tricks, to take back Emerald City (with an approaching World War, the 1939 scenarists apparently refused to view the world with rose-colored glasses). Evanora's army of flying baboons, are tricked into entering the poppy seed field where they fall asleep after being lured by mechanical scarecrows, constructed by Oz craftsmen (another nod in the long line of nods to the classic Oz). The powerful Theodora, proves not to be powerful at all--fleeing the city after being freaked out by Oscar's holographic projection of himself as a malevolent and powerful wizard.<br /><br />Oscar's transformation from arrogant con man to humanitarian, is not explained very well. What's worse is the unconvincing way in which he defeats the two seemingly powerful wicked witches (they just can't seem to realize that there's no true force behind his bag of magic tricks). In the end, we never become invested in Oscar's journey as we are in Dorothy's. When Dorothy exclaims, \\"I'm scared, Auntie Em, I'm scared\\", we believe it! That's because the personification of the evil she faces (in the form of the Wicked Witch) appears real. Not so for Disney's two ineffectual wicked witches and the syrupy, sentimental allies, who assist Oscar, in his quest to restore the land of Oz, to a rightful, balanced equilibrium.elain girl bonds with Oscar on a childlike level and ends up helping Glinda free herself from the bad witches, after she's captured and put in chains in Emerald City.

B008TMA1LY|3.0|This game is very cute with the Hello Kitty characters. It plays like Diner Dash, except less robust.  Cute music and graphics.  I played til level 22 and had enough. No matter how quickly and orderly I did things all the customers were always mad. Not too fun to see all those flashing angry thought bubble on every customer. Diner Dash is challenging but less maddening. I will delete after I post my review.<br /><br />Oh btw you have to spend real money to get helpers. You are all alone in that restaurant. It's cute for a bit, but don't expect to get anywhere easily without spending money for the upgrades that will help you not be frustrated. Who's the angry customer now?!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|The movie was funny!  It was great to hear it was voiced by Billy Crystal and John Goodman.  Sometimes the same actors don't do the voices for second movies.  Seeing all the original characters as younger monsters was cute.  Roz made a cameo, too.  The movie helped establish the history all the monsters have with each other and how it all fits together.  Great show.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good hunting game great graphics. Fun to play and not timed so it's a lot more fun without the timed hunts.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|My kids  (3 and 6 year old) LOVE this game....challenging enough, similar to Mario Bros...cute music, very nice graphics.  I recommend this one for sure.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|STRANGE but fascinating.....I was told if I liked The Hunger Games I would like this one.  Well they were right. Not really like The Hunger Games at all and a very good read. Buying book two now.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Honestly I lived this app it's so fun. I love the fact that you can do panorama on the video setting
B00F8LPH90|5.0|This game has good graphics. Kind of a real military feel to it. Worth the 99 cents. Many challenges to achieve too.
1451666179|5.0|Prompt delivery (with a small discount!) the book is brilliant. Allie at her best with some favourites from the blog and some new stoires.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is challenging without making you nuts.  I enjoyed the levels but there are only 10 right now. clues would be helpful but aren't really needed unless you are super impatient. if you are super impatient then this game isn't for you.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's great that I was finally able to purchase Candy Crush Saga for my Kindle Fire!  I really enjoy trying to complete each level. It is such a challenge and lots of fun!  Thanks Amazon!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Fun until I was done.  If you like find its and puzzles this is a great AP.  I eventually worked my way all the way through it and finally took it off my Kindle but it works well and is great for killing time while traveling or waiting for whatever you're waiting for.
1594744769|4.0|Keeping in mind this is a young-adult book, I found it quite entertaining. The young characters are sweet. It was a nice break from my ordinary type of reading. The main character's relationship with his father is a bit underdeveloped, and some parts are far-fetched (even more so than the parts that are supposed to be far-fetched.) Still, a worthwhile read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using this alarm clock for over a year now and am thoroughly satisfied with it.  Easy to set, allows multiple alarms and the ability to use the music of you choice as an alarm - important because I can chose songs that wake me up before they wake my wife. I'm out the door at 5:00 a.m. and the wife doesn't get up until 7:00.  Has a setting that allows for increasing volume until you wake up.  Tried several - this is the best.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was a fairly good book after the first 70 pages.  I knew there would be a twist.  I was just not sure until the last 100 pages.  An ok read but he has written better novels.
B008EL4YX6|3.0|It's okay - I got it as the ap o' the day.  Not sure it's worth 99 cents but if you like &#34;growing worm&#34; style games this might be for you, just wasn't my cup of tea.  Worked well on my Kindle.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Having fun playing it. Finding lots of things and ok dialog. Too much talk.<br />Nothing else to say. Why can't I just rate..
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Liked it so much I bought it.  I tried several &#34;alarm clock radio&#34; aps before I settled on this one.  Easily the best, it will let you: -have multiple alarms (I have ten saved for various times/days of the week) -choose any music on you Kindle as your wake up song -set the wake up to gradually increase in volume (important because I usually come instantly awake and can shut it off before it wakes my wife - I'm out the door at 5 a.m. and she doesn't appreciate me waking her up that early) -can be set to not allow snooze  The only downside I can see is that you have to open your Kindle (slide the lock bar) to shut it off.  it would be nice if it took over the screen on wake up but other than that, it's perfect
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've been lifting weights for over 8 years now. I've done football and basketball coaches' workout routines, routines from bodybuilder's, and my own routines. I love the info in this book because it's based on science and results, not the typical &#34;flavor of the month&#34; workouts you see in magazines. The principles in this book are simple and yet effective (I've gained 38 pounds in 15 months). However, I would not recommend an athlete to copy the workout routines (rep schemes, exercises, etc). Do the workout your coaches give you. But DEFINITELY use the princinples this book offers in how muscle is built and how you actually get stronger. If I had known those things when I was in high school, I would have gotten a lot bigger than I did, no question.
B00701L5XS|4.0|Great ap for a knot knut.  I'm a Scout Master and this is a handy ap for teaching knots to the &#34;electronics generation&#34;.  Not sure if it's worth more than 99 cents to any but a diehard knot fan but I enjoy it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Even though some may pooh pooh this book because he doesn't focus on the Holy Trinity, I loved it because it was an honest expression of what Eben experienced from his point of view.  I agree totally with him that there is no conflict between God and Science.  In fact God created it.  The more we discover about what has been created, the more in awe we become about his unfathomable intelligence.  Very good read!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Allows you to work on all of the normal Microsoft office products. I've tried a couple of different versions on Kindle aps for office product and this one is best.  Has a version of Excel,  Power Point, Word and PDF reader.  I can download a presentation or some letters and take them with me as I travel, making corrections or changes and then email it back to myself for printing.  Definitely worth the price.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Excellent movie, a hidden \\"gem\\".  Overtones of Princess Bride without some of the slapstick.  The cast is also remarkable... with De Niro and Pfeiffer in unexpected roles, along with the Danes and Cox (Boardwalk Empire).  The movie is about more than just true love - it has the morals of be careful what you wish for and look past what you think love is to find true love - look past the cover....
B000FA5SMK|4.0|A fast paced murder mystery with hurricanes, wine and Capt. Kidd's treasure. A little heavy on unnecessary descriptions of unimportant things, but mostly entertaining.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I keep trying others but end up coming back to SwiftKey every time.  Seems like it knows me! The prediction is almost always spot on.
B0091X2NA2|5.0|I loved it! Very few movies can surprise me and this is one of those few.<br /><br />Just remember: DON'T PUSH THE BUTTON!<br /><br />I'm watching this one again.  It was that good!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait for the movie! The cliffhanger is too much!! No fair, I didn't want it to end. Great easy reading from day to day. On to book three.
B00EVW0VTI|2.0|The new president has decided to end war in the Middle East by removing all troops from the area, and asking all the powers there (Iran, Syria, etc.) to come together and make peace. Singing kumbaya is optional. An evil chief of the Secret Service plots to have the White House taken over by his own army of racists, disgruntled military and a computer geek. They and their weapons get into the White House without a problem, take down everyone, hold hostages, and the entire American military do nothing but stand outside the White House and watch. It's unclear exactly what these invaders want, but they're killing a lot of people, making an enormous amount of noise and doing a lot of damage. They supposedly want to capture the President alive, but keep shooting at him with big guns. The computer geek hacks into a presidential computer, which supposedly gives access to every rocket launcher under U.S. command. This has been compared to Die Hard by other reviewers, but I loved that movie and this ain't that. The humor is missing, as well as the suspense and excitement. This reads more like a badly written political statement. I'm a Democrat and I found this idiocy embarrassing. Any resemblance to living politicians is obviously intentional. The President is our Ghandi, so guess who the bad guys are? *spoiler alert* By the end of the movie it's still unclear why they needed the president alive, and Iran agrees to a peace treaty since the U.S. asked so nicely.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really love it. I am addicted. fun for all of us to play. love all the different costumes and competing against friends in weekly completion.  deft recommend this game.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|What made this novel so harrowing for me is the possibility that this can actually happen.  There are so many tools in place to expand and develop a fully exposed society.  I, myself, have deactivated and activated FaceBook a number of times simply because I felt that I was being suckered into posting more and more.<br /><br />I love Egger's writing - his humor, sarcasm and ideas.  The book fully engaged me, and I highly recommend it.  In fact, I even gave it a plug on FaceBook - go figure!
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|Denzel is an awesome actor and I chose this movie just because of him.  He did not disappoint at all as he was wonderful as usual.  The movie itself was very boring.  I watched through to the end because I kept hoping for some unexpected twist however it never came.  The entire movie was about alcoholism and addiction, nothing else.  A few other reviewers mentioned the sex scene at the beginning of the movie.  I agree that this was unecessary and didn't fit in with the movie at all.  It wasn't necessary to have the flight attendant in full nudity.  The point of that scene just seemed to be to show that particular woman's goods to the world.  She's probably make high dollar porn now.

0307743659|5.0|This might be the best Stephen King book I've read.<br /><br />The progression is logical despite the illogical nature of the subject matter. I'd spoil a bit of the plot but there can't be anyone alive on the western hemisphere of the planet over the age of 15 who doesn't know the details.<br /><br />The book is, as always, much better than the movie and even tops the miniseries that tried to do the story more faithfully. I read this one thirty years and more after the movie came out and after seeing the miniseries and it still fascinated me and had me wishing it wasn't going to go where I knew it was going to.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|We all may wonder what would have happened in our lives if we had chosen one path over another.  How might our lives have been different? Lives can be changed with one casual action, or one terrible secret.  We all live behind a wall of our own making, but do we wonder what would happen if the wall comes crashing down? Would we take the new life presented to us, the life on the other side? Or are we more likely to stay behind our own wall, no matter how horrible our lives? These are the types of questions Liane Moriarty poses to us in &#34;The Husband's Secret.&#34;  Once you learn of the horrible secret, the novel continues to quicken it's pace, leaving you breathless at the climax, and pondering the aforementioned questions in the epilogue. This is a book you won't be able to put down, and one you'll continue to think about long after you're done.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|love the gameplay.  i'm still on the first region and having a lot of fun.  can't wait to keep playing.

Reading this book helps to spark creativity and open the child's mind to other ways they can use their favorite crayon colors. Well done!  Update: At first I gave this book 3 stars, but over time as we read and re-read I am finding that my daughter loves it even after she has heard it 20 times or more. For that reason I am upgrading my star review to 5 stars. Especially since we have owned this book for quite some time and she still adores the characters. It's a great book to purchase. Enjoy!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I find the irony agonizing, that the \\"chromecast\\" doesn't actually cast a chrome browser.  Basically, it just gives you access to hulu and Netflix.  This has a long way to go to be of any use.  I was hoping to free up my chromebook by using the chromecast to access my web content.  Nope.  Silly Google.  What were you thinking?  I mean I love you guys, but this was a flop or at best a missed opportunity for something really cool.

B00DEFW998|5.0|I’ve recently seen an interview with Anoushka Shankar.  The interviewee asked her if she considered this album to be a tribute to her recently deceased father, the great Ravi Shankar.  Ms. Shankar replied by indicating that her father passed during the making of the album, and therefore she considered it as an offering to his memory.  I saw that as a very thoughtful response, and it certainly doesn’t take away from the treasures offered on her latest release.<br /><br />The commercial draw of “Traces of You” will be, of course, the three tracks featuring vocals by Anoushka’s half-sister, Norah Jones.  The title track is sweet, and slight in instrumentation: sitar, tablas, Norah’s voice and piano, and electronics by Nitin Sawhney.  Anoushka Shankar and Nitin Sawhney make excellent collaborators for this release, as musicians and composers.  The electronics supplement the traditional Indian instrumentation, without being too obtrusive.  An excellent album.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What an interesting scenario!<br /><br />I normally wouldn't like the \\"layered vignette\\" style of story telling, but it worked for this, and I still got a sense of a plot. In fact, I'd probably like to read/view it again as a more beginning to end narrative.<br /><br />So, does this make southern Georgia of AMC`s The Walking Dead a White Zone, or a Blue Zone?

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|My daughter highly recommended this book, and I trust her editorials. When the story began, it seemed a little predictable, but grew into a terrific plot, weaving the lives of these seemingly unconnected people into a delicious full woven piece of work. The choices we make, the little decisions that seem to be so insignificant, can turn our lives and those around us, into something we couldn't quite imagine. Also speaks to the perceptions we have about people and circumstances, that may or may not be accurate, and the way we gather evidence to support these beliefs, and how distorted our attitudes become, especially since  they may be so far from the truth. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, because just as the plot turns out so far from what we could imagine, life can turn out that way also. It really illustrates how we make judgements and assumptions about people and their behaviors, we really don't know what any individual is really dealing with. The conclusions reached about long term marriage and relationships really make you stop and think..an excellent read!

1451666179|5.0|About the only time I get to read anymore is while I'm on the porcelain throne, so I've been keeping this book in my bathroom. A friend of mine comes over to hang out, and at some point he excuses himself to the restroom. Twenty minutes later, he emerges with the book and excitedly says to me, &#34;This book is so great!! Have you read it?!&#34; (As if he had just pulled it off the bookshelf at Barnes and Noble instead of, say, picking it up off of my bathroom counter.) He proceeds to sit down on the couch and continue reading. TRUE STORY

B0021L8V0W|5.0|Angelina Jolie is a VERY convincing action star. She should do more of this. She brings a realism to her performances. You never doubt for a second that she could do everything her character does.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This is a specialty device that probably has a limited applicability for most people. Specifically, it's a NAVSTAR GPS receiver that outputs NMEA 0183 data. That's all it does, but it does it with a SIRF-Star III chipset, which is one of the best GPS micro-chipsets ever produced: my Garmin 60CX uses this same chipset, and it's one of the best handheld GPS receivers ever made for the consumer market.<br /><br />Most people buying devices like this (generically called USB/GPS dongles), will use them to add real-time GPS capability to laptop computers, for use in marine or on-the-road navigation, or vehicle tracking.  The BU-353 is self contained, needs no batteries (powered directly from the USB port), and has a refresh rate of 1 hz. In other words, it outputs a complete set of coordinates and NMEA data once per second.  With WAAS/EGNOS enabled, the maximum precision, or \\"error ellipse\\" that this GPS can deliver is approximately 8 to 10 feet under ideal conditions. Since conditions are rarely \\"ideal\\", a more realistic error ellipse is probably 20 feet.  With WASS disabled, or if no WASS satellites are visible at a given time, the error ellipse is about 30 feet.<br /><br />To actually make use of this device, you will need to acquire navigation software and maps. There are many software packages available to do real-time GPS navigation on a laptop. Some of these are freeware, like SeaClear, OpenCPN, and MapFactor Navigator, while others are commercial, like Fugawi, and cost substantial amounts of money for the software and maps.  I have used SeaClear for several years, and have recently installed OpenCPN and MapFactor Navigator, so will describe these briefly in the rest of this review. NOTE: Garmin no longer supports real-time GPS navigation with any of it's software (MapSource, BaseCamp, HomePort), so don't buy a BU-353 with the idea of using it with any Garmin software! Garmin's N-Route software, which is no longer supported by Garmin but can be found on the internet, can do real-time GPS navigation, but ONLY from devices that output the Garmin Serial data format. N-Route CAN NOT read the NMEA-0183 data stream from the BU-353.<br /><br />What's in the package: The BU-353 comes with about 6 feet of USB cable, which is probably not enough for mounting on the roof of any car bigger than a small sedan, so you will probably need a USB extension cable.<br />It has a magnet built in to stick the device to a (steel) vehicle roof. For mounting on a non-magnetic surface like fiberglass, use double-sided tape.  The package also contains a CD with the drivers, and a utility program that has two functions: it turns the device on or off, and displays the NMEA data stream and a map of the satellites visible to the device at a given moment.  Other reviewers have reported difficulties getting this device to work on a Macbook; I am running it an a Dell Vostro laptop under Windows XP (32 bit) and it works as advertised.<br /><br />Setup and configuration: This may present some difficulties for computer owners who are not \\"power users\\". First, install the drivers and the \\"GPS Info\\" utility program from the CD, then plug in the BU-353 and reboot the computer to make sure the OS has the driver loaded and is powering and reading the data stream from the BU-353. The BU-353 has a small red LED on the side, just to the left of the cable, that should be flashing about once per second if it's working properly. Run the GPS Info program and see if it is reporting the expected number of satellites in view, and look at the NMEA data stream.  If GPS Info is not showing any satellites or NMEA data, you probably have a COM port issue: go into Device Manager and check your settings again.  NOTE: The SIRF Star III chipset requires at least 4 satellites to be in view to obtain a 3-D position lock. If you are indoors, especially in a building or on a boat with a metal roof or deck above you, you may need to stick the BU-353 outside on a window ledge or something sothat it can see at least part of the sky.<br /><br />You have to go into the Hardware Properties/Device manager of your operating system and manually set the serial port that you want the BU-353 to use, then do the same on each navigation software with which you will use the device. If you know how to open Device Manager on your computer, the setting you will need to make is under \\"Ports\\". Find the BU-353 in the Device List, then look over the Serial Ports list and pick a Com Port that is not being used by some other device or service (a lower numbered one like COM 2 is best for compatibility with older navigation software like SeaClear). Then assign this Com Port to the BU-353. Sorry I can't be more specific. You either know how to do this, or you will have to get help from a friend who has more computer tech savvy.<br /><br />Once you have the Com Port set up and the GPS Info program is reporting satellites in view and a steady stream of NMEA data, you can proceed to setting up your Navigation software.  I will briefly describe three freeware packages I am familiar with. NOTE: Under Windows, COM parts can not usually be shared by multiple applications. What this means, for example, is that if you are using the \\"GPS Info\\" program, and then want to use OpenCPN, you have to exit GPS Info to free up the Com port so that OpenCPN can use it.  I have heard about patches for Windows that work around this limitation and allow Com Port sharing, but I haven't tried any of them.<br /><br />1. SeaClear II. This is a Marine navigation package that uses geo-referenced raster charts only. You can download raster charts in BSB/KAP format from various sources, like the NOAA National Ocean Service in the United States, or you can create your own charts in WCI format by manually georeferencing any raster image, for example downloaded Google Earth imagery. I have done this, and it works, but is very labor intensive and time consuming. It's completely impractical to do this for any body of water larger than a small bay or lake that can be covered by a few map tiles.<br /><br />2. OpenCPN. This is also a marine charting system, much newer than SeaClear (\\"newer\\" does NOT imply \\"better\\", they are both good systems), but OpenCPN has one big advantage over SeaClear: it uses either raster KAP charts OR S-57 format Electronic vector charts, which are becoming the standard as they are much easier for Governmnent cartographic agencies to update and distribute, and require a lot less file storage space than scanned raster charts.  Both SeaClear and OpenCPN show your vessel's position in real time on a chart, automatically pan the charts as you move, and give you tools for measurement and route planning.<br /><br />3. MapFactor Navigator. This is a land-based navigation system that uses the free OpenStreetMaps cartography. It shows your vehicle in real time on a moving map, and has tools for measurement and route planning. It also has a voice (Alyson), to warn you of upcoming turns and a warning alarm for when you are exceeding the speed limit. The version of MapFactor Navigator that you will run with your BU-353  on your laptop computer is very similar to MapFactor Navigator on an Android device or (presumably) an I-phone. I run MapFactor on my Samsung Galaxy under Android Gingerbread and it is virtually identical to the GUI of MapFactor Navigator on my Dell laptop running XP. WARNING: using a laptop to navigate in your car is possibly illegal in some jurisdictions, at least if it was installed up front in the driver's seat area. It would be more appropriate in an RV, where your \\"significant other\\" could use it as a co-pilot.  Bottom line though, is that a TomTom or Garmin Nuvi is really a more practical car navigation device, considering how heavy and bulky a laptop computer is.  The nice thing about Open Sreet Maps is that they are free to download and give you a quick and easy way to obtain mapping from the comfort of your home or a hotel room (with wifi), for a location that you will be visiting the next day but for which you have have not previously installed mapping. Note that Open Street Maps is maintained and operated by unpaid volunteers, so the quality and accuracy of the mapping is open to question: YGWYPF (you get what you pay for) and TANSTAAFL (there ain't no such thing as a free lunch) are the rule here. Open Street Maps and Map Factor Navigator will usually - almost always, really - get you where you need to go, but the auto-route that Navigator will present to you may or may not actually be the \\"fastest\\", \\"shortest\\", or \\"cheapest\\" route. It's always best to research your route in advance of a road trip, if possible, when using any GPS navigation system, so that you have a mental picture of what route you want to take. This way, if your GPS tries to get you to turn off onto an unexpected side road, you can keep to your planned route with confidence. Every GPS with auto-routing I have ever used, both the free and commercial ones, occasionally have bugs in the programmed routing nodes and routing algorithms, and they will occasionally give you bad routing advice.  The thing to do is to keep to your pre-planned route and the GPS will re-calculate within 1/4 mile of the turn you didn't take.<br /><br />SUMMARY: The BU-353 adds NAVSTAR GPS capability to almost any laptop computer, for the specific purpose of using a laptop as a real-time navigation system. Other uses may be for geotagging photographs, although a handheld GPS or smartphone with a GPS App installed is probably a more practical choice for geotagging photos.  NOTE: The SIRFfStar III chipset in the Bu-353 has been an industry standard for many years, but is now obsolescent (as of 2013), as newer chipsets offer both NAVSTAR and GLONASS capability. GLONASS is the Russian GPS satellite constellation, and GPS receivers with GLONASS capability offer nearly double the number of satellites that can be tracked, for better positional accuracy in deep canyons, under heavy tree cover, or in urban environments. The BU-353 is inexpensive, durably built, and requires no batteries, being powered directly from the USB bus on your laptop.dy of water larger than a small bay or lake that can be covered by a few map tiles.<br /><br />2.

B008JFUO4U|5.0|I really do feel that the critics, who reviewed and did not like this movie, don't like science fiction to begin with. If that's the case, stick with your \\"period\\" films and \\"drunk weekend\\" pics.<br /><br />This movie was great from start to finish, special effects are really good and I felt the story was a very good one and did not get lost in the array of eye popping effects. I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan but he did a great job as did the other actors in this film. Glad I bought this to include in my large DVD library.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I just finished it two minutes ago. I couldn't stop. So good. So true how lives are intertwined. Secrets kept along with insecurities. How we find strength when we know there is nothing left. I love how this author puts the true feelings and how we think into words. Truly relatable.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|The experiments worked, not immediately always, but uncannily. The titles of the principles herein are a bit kitschy, but in that maybe more memorable. It was a fun read, but more serious in content than the style suggests.
B00FRMCYQ4|2.0|Turbo is an absolute, although harmless, miss.<br /><br />And I'm not just saying this for adult audiences. I watched Turbo with an audience of 8 kids, and not one of them really laughed, smiled, or showed anything more than remote interest. Virtually everything about this movie is misdirected and stale.<br /><br />First off, there's the ludicrous premise - a snail gets sucked into the engine of a dragster and magically gets headlights, a car alarm, and can go speeds upwards of 300 miles and hour. Turbo does not require audiences to suspend their disbelief, but hang it from a gibbet and throw the remains into the sea. When you can't relate to your main character, you aren't invested in the movie. When you aren't invested in the movie, the movie is bad.<br /><br />Second, there's the puzzlingly dark tone. Seriously, did this take place in Sin City or a charming kid's movie? Half the movie takes place in these dark scary, derelict slums, inhabited by strange characters that are not in the least bit reassuring for kids. The snails are not the worst of it; it's the humans that are the real miss for Turbo. As shown by my child audience, not ONE of the humans is remotely interesting or relateable.<br /><br />Third, there's the film's lazy tone. Turbo isn't even trying. At least Smurfs 2 - the worst cartoon of the year - was anything BUT lazy (and also devoid of ANY redeeming features). Turbo is content to creep along at a snails pace, without any sort of colour or life. The plot is as cliched as they ever come, meaning the movie is not remotely interesting. It has the old \\"Follow your dreams/Wish upon a star/Dream big/You can do it\\" sentimental, cliched trite coming out the wazoo.<br /><br />I could go on, talking about the poor attempts at puns, quirkiness, and sentimental ending, but really, this is a movie for kids. It shouldn't be dissected that much. But it's not a GOOD movie for kids - it fulfills the barest obligation for a kid's film - it's a harmless, moral-teaching, remotely interesting cartoon for kids that won't do them any harm. It won't do them much good, though, either.<br /><br />And one more thing; I noticed that both The Smurfs 2 and Turbo used the pun \\"Snailed it\\" at least once. These films happen to be the worst kids fare of the year. Maybe someone should have taken note.<br /><br />P.S. For some GOOD 2013 kids fare, seek out The Croods, Monster's University, Despicable Me 2, or Epic. Cheers!ing, remotely interesting cartoon for kids that won't do them any harm. It won't do them much good, though, either.<br /><br />And one more thing; I noticed that both The Smurfs 2 and Turbo used the pun \\"Snailed it\\" at least once.

B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Ever worried that Pixar has lost it's touch with sequels and films in general? Well you can stop worrying now. Monsters University is a delightfully entertaining film, filled with originality, humor, and Pixar's typical heart, that, while not ranking amongst Pixar's most ambitious films, is certainly among it's most delightful.<br /><br />From right out of the gate, with a Simpsons-worthy sight gag, Monsters University sets the fun, light, engaging tone that will keep both kids and adults entertained throughout.<br /><br />First off, the voicework is phenomenal. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are experts at this game by now, and their work is typically up to standard. Helen Mirren is shiversome-ly good as Dean Hardscrabble, and Nathan Fillion and Alfred Molina give great roles.<br /><br />Second, the film is filled with every sort of color and originality and humor in designing the monsters. MU is a bright and cheery film that is pleasant on the eyes, heavy on the laughs, and liberal with the heart. Just when you thought that the film was following a stereo-typical underdog story, Pixar changes up the ballgame. The ending of MU, especially, deserves loads of praise, for being simultaneously scary, hilarious, original, and actually quite moving.<br /><br />What more can I say? Monsters University is another hit from Pixar, sure to entertain both children and adults with colorful visuals, a fast-paced, funny story, and loads of humor and heart. Our friends at the Lamp certainly have a lot more great things in store for us in the future!<br /><br />Oozma Kappa for the win!

B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It is an amazing game the best racing game me and my family have ever played on the kindle fire
B004DTLK62|4.0|Excellent movie with great performances all around.  Downey got robbed not winning the Oscar.  Would have given 5 stars but didn't due to special features not working.  The picture appears as a postage stamp size in the upper left corner of your screen.  This is a problem that has been noted by many others and nothing has been done to fix it!  Also, the picture quality is about the same as that found on the DVD edition, so get the DVD.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was able to download local weather when there was wifi available. It wasn't particularly accurate (possibly the fault of the weather service, not this app.) But it was a convenient, quick way to get local weather while away on a vacation. Set your location and get wifi and you will have a forecast by hour or by day.
1401900526|5.0|Inspirational cards.  Arrived on time and in good shape.  A great help for people with anxiety issues. Highly recommend to all.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app makes an alarm clock out of your Kindle. I used it as a travel alarm clock--our hotel did not have a clock in the room nor did the ship we were aboard. (Not sure what the Chileans had against clocks, but they were kind of missing many places we went.) You can choose the format (digital 12 or 24 hour or analog) and set multiple alarms. I used the multiple alarm feature a lot as we had all kinds of departures, deadlines, and appointments to make on a complicated journey.<br /><br />The clock app allows you to use a tone, musical snatches of melody or your own tunes as your wake up call. The large numbers were great for viewing bedside at night without eyeglasses. There is a weather component as well. Very useful for traveling with your Kindle. I was quite pleased.
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|It takes a lot of work to research things like this and I appreciate the effort everyone put out in making this movie, people like me who don't often look for videos like this one aren't as aware of these kind of issues and this movie was very eye opening to me. I am a lover of all animals and like many others I love to see them every chance I get, parks like sea world give people that chance to have the most personal experience possible with them and we sometimes don't realize what's actually going on. Everyone has their own opinion and I'm sure this movie will get a lot of crap but I think it's very enlightening. And coming from a real animal lover, as much as I appreciate their beauty and love to see them up close at sea world, I love them enough to never go back and I will share this and do everything in my power to help anyway I can.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Excellent read -- makes you remember the angst of this time of life. I enjoyed the differing viewpoints for new perspectives.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Starts with a distinctively chick-lit flavor, but improves as storylines weave over and under one another, shifting their shades and transforming familiar patterns into whole new designs. Moriarty bravely grapples with the shoulda, coulda, mightabeens and spins a worthy tale.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Although, like many people have noted, I have encountered very few teenagers who actually speak like Hazel and Gus (and I am a HS teacher), I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A family member recently has been battling cancer and this book hit home.<br /><br />I have children -a teen and a preteen- and I read this book &#34;as a mom.&#34; Hazel's mom's fear of not being a mom anymore really struck me.<br /><br />Excellent quick read you won't forget.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Ilove this game but it wont let me play it on my kindle fire with out wifi. Please is there any way that I can fix it or can they fix it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am so excited that this finally came to Kindle! Can't wait for more levels!!!!! Make more of them faster please.....
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|Horrible movie wouldn't recommend it to anyone ever. Very poorly done . Dont buy or rent this movie even if you are desparate.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I enjoyed the book,but found the part describing the fortress to be too long and boring.  I lost interest and almost decided not to finish reading the book, but I did I did finish the book and I am glad I did.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This was a good book but brought me to tears. Not really how I wanted to see this series end! Depressing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush glad it came to  the kindle just wish that I could beat the level I am stuck on lol .. maybe now that I play on 3 devices I can finally do it!!!  Lol
B00EBEZ182|3.0|Ok. Not very surprising, lots of info from media.. New insights into the firm include things like one million dollar trades and nuppets..
B008RA3X5E|4.0|love the white noise function helps me sleep!<br />easy to operate, easy to read<br />nothing too involved in set up and use.
B00DT99BX6|4.0|After reading this book all I can say is…whew. This book started and ended clearly, no confusion at all. As for the middle of this book, the author created obstacle after obstacle just to get us to the point we all were expecting. She took romance to a new level by adding a bunch of mystery, action and drama in the middle. Now, I think she did a bit too much in the middle and can easily cut some things out.<br /><br />The story follows Camille, a daughter of a rich guy who makes weapons. She’s feeling crowded by all the extra security he has following her to keep her safe and decides she wants to escape the constant spotlight. That could easily be the entire plot of the book but is honestly just a small fraction.<br /><br />There’s just a ton of different plots and plots twist in the book. It takes us from one extreme to the other. This author covers a ton of different genres. Some readers may enjoy that while others may simply take it as overkill. Overall, she managed to start and finish the book well. And even though there’s so much going on in the middle: from kidnappings, to trips, to proposals, to therapy, the book never got muddled or confused.<br /><br />I need a smoke break after this one and a long nap.
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Did not download / install properly.  Ended up deleting. I was told that this is a very large download which may be what happened but if after 4  and a half days it was still in process.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|This is a very well-done movie.  Even though there is only one actor trapped in one place for most of the movie, it is filmed in such a way that it is gripping and captures the audience.  I also did not find it too bloody or gorey, which some audiences were concerned about. The dramatic scenes were handled very well.
B00G8YVVYG|3.0|Season 4, up to Episode 5, has not been as good as usual. All the background Woodbury people are slowly being killed off one by one. It's going to take forever, but the writers need an excuse to get the group small again. Maybe like five Woodbury people will survive. The governor is obviously going to come back; probably after the mid-season break, and massacre the remaining Woodbury people. What happened to the stakes. The whole Carol arc was cool, but it took way to long and was boring. I'm waiting for something BIG to happen. Something exciting, and gut wrenching. Character development is great, it is essential to a story and builds people up right before something big happens. But when nothing big happens, it's pointless.<br />The writers need to have something huge happen, and, even though it may sound harsh, they need to kill some main characters. Hershel, and possible Beth, could be killed. We care about them, but they're not main characters. I will admit I cried during Amy and Lori's death throughout the show. I haven't even gotten close since Lori. Not. Even. Close.<br />The first eight episodes, I think, are going to deal with the disease and other minor arcs. The second eight are going to reintroduce the governor and SPOILERS! Abraham, Eugene, and Rosita, who will lead the group to Washington D.C. The governor will die this season, I'm promising you that. They will leave the prison for some reason. Maybe the governor will destroy the gates, a ton of Woodbury people die, and the group has to flee with the newbies.<br />But for now, there is no suspense keeping the pace up. Since the governor isn't coming for a while, they need some sort of force driving all the characters, and us, over the breaking point. We need something BIG, like I said before.<br />I love The Walking Dead. It's such a strong story and has a lot of creativity. But before the ninth episode, or mid-season break, I'm praying they will kill off at least two main characters.<br />Thanks forreading!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like this game except some items are hard to find because. I dont know the meaning of the word.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My family and I love it and enjoy playing it. I recommend it to everyone who likes to play games.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|Horrible controls go hand in hand with worse graphics. As close to completely unplayable as you can get. Glad it was free. If I'd spent money on this I'd be irate.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|A+ Performance from Denzel. He must of done a lot of research for this part because you really believed he was a drunk. The story was compelling and strong to the point .
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I wanted to read this book for two reasons...first I loved the name of the title..second I generally love the author.  However I found this read to be too lengthy in terms of discombobulated ramblings of up and down characters and places..I found myself trying to remember who what when and where almost everytime I picked up the book. That is frustrating for me as my reading time is limited at best but it is something I carve out time for because I love reading. My opinion is that it took way too long to read and had way too many characters who didn't have to be added in to make this a great story. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster ride..it's fun and exciting at first and if the ride is short then the thrill effect stays in the memory...the ride is fast and fun and up and down and you can't wait to ride it again...if the ride takes too long and goes around the same up and down track over and over and over, you either get sick or bored and neither one of those feelings leaves you wanting to get on that ride again ever..the book was good in the beginning but went on and on until I was bored and in the end was still trying to follow all of the 5 \\"w\\" questions.  The very end was sappy and I was so disappointed that I had wasted so much time and effort trying to finish this story.
0307476073|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is an unconventional woman whose memoir, WILD:  FROM LOST TO FOUND ON THE PACIFIC COAST TRAIL, is stuffed with, duh, memories, maybe too many.  She lets it all loose starting with her troubled past, then her clumsy but tenacious hike over a thousand plus tortuous miles of wilderness, then finishes with a celebration of life as it is, with greater understanding of her self-condemnation; perhaps with less regret.<br /><br />I’d heard a lot about the book.  Many of my book-loving friends, trusted and unfailingly astute, didn’t like it.  Others raved about it but wiggled their eyebrows with that “I’m not sure why” implication.  I’ve read it myself now and have my own opinion.<br /><br />Was it overwritten with too much information?  Are there parts that could have been written with more diplomacy or omitted entirely?  Is the author too obsessed with her past and with her instant place?  Is she weak and too easily manipulated?  Does she spend too much time with details that are not important or that don’t add to her story?  The answer to all these questions is yes.  In spite of all this, is this a great book?  The answer is Hell, yes.<br /><br />Strayed is willing to present the details of her troubled life without flinching or asking permission.  Her view seems to be that: “It happened.  I’m telling you about it.  It’s my book and I don’t give a fig about your opinion.”  That seems to me to be a righteous attitude for a writer.<br /><br />She is also talented with words.  Her descriptive scene setting is incomparable.  Her ability to present her thoughts in understandable prose is compelling.  She drags the reader along by sharing her trials with tactile expression.  When she is elated, the reader feels it.  When she is broken down and trembling with fatigue, the reader seeks relief from the pain.<br /><br />I know a little something about hiking, having been a backpacker in my younger days.  Her trials with the act of lugging a heavy pack up long and steep trails in either bone dry heat or bone chilling moisture came across as totally accurate and prompted the return of some long past unpleasant memories of my own.  I recognized the sore feet, the chafed shoulders, the alligatoring of skin around the hips, the hunger and thirst, the wet and the chill, and the lust for a milk shake.  What I didn’t see was that Strayed ever got winded on long, uphill stretches.  The almost claustrophobic fog, unbelievable pain in the chest, shortness of breath, and hopeless feeling that the torture will never end as endless stretches of uphill pathway lay in full view ahead, were never mentioned by the author.  And she was carrying the Monster pack.<br /><br />So, I liked the book.  And I admired the way the author put it all together.  I felt her need to assuage all the old demons by doing something of character and with mitigating pain.  There’s an old story about the drunk who wobbles around the party, finally plopping on the lap of a cutie where he announces in boozy breath, “Hi.  My name’s Dick.  How do you like me so far?”  Stay nestled in my memory, Cheryl Strayed.  I think I’m in love with you.<br /><br />Schuyler T Wallace<br />Author of TIN LIZARD TALES

B00AO686MY|5.0|One of my all time favorite films. Having it on Blu-ray is amazing. The special features are average, but I don't usually care for them anyway. A must.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Trying to tell EVERYTHING that is happening in the known world is a bold endeavor, and difficult to pull off without some confusion setting in.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|NO SOUND!  What good is a movie if you cannot hear it?  Rented it and there was no sound. Everything else works just fine from prime... oh except American Horror Story...
030759565X|5.0|The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is great to have on your shelf.  The cook book has a lot of different recipes to choose from.  I recommend it to anyone who likes to cook.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Since I thought after Die Hard 4 came out a few years ago, I did not expect a 5th one. But its a good movie just the same and I like all the Die Hard movies. I like Bruce Willis playing the role and in this one he finds his long lost son who is a spy in the CIA. They team up for more action to take down the bad guys. So this movie has a little bit of a &#34;Jason Bourne&#34; style of a storyline combined with traditional &#34;Die Hard&#34;.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like being able to play this without having to get on Facebook. I can just sit back and take my time without being constantly interrupted or it lagging.
0891419195|5.0|Personal experience of a horrible world event. Helped me to go beyond &#34;The Pacific&#34; miniseries and learn more about the man &#34;Sledgehammer&#34; and his experiences and their lifelong impact
B00FF5SXB8|1.0|I had high hopes when I saw the previews for Agents of Shield, only to have those hopes fade episode by episode. The creativity is lacking and the writing has been very poor. This has not been a good production from the people who brought us great movies like X-men, Avengers, Spiderman, Thor, Captain America or Iron Man. I was expecting something on the level or beyond that of Heroes, especially when I saw the previews from the first show featuring an actor who was a part of the Heroes movement. Each week I have attempted to give the series a chance to get better, but each episode my hopes have faded. The show needs a shot of adrenaline and character development. It has been pathetic. They fight unimaginative creatures. The commentary between the characters has been week. I don't believe in anything they are doing. It fails to capture any sense of reality. Too bad... If they can address these issues maybe they can do something amazing for the tv experience.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|An interesting well written book.  I am bothered by the fact that it took Piper so long to realize the impact her behavior had on other people.  In the beginning it seems her only regret was getting caught.  We all make bad decisions but usually not this serious.  She seems to be floundering; oh I think I will be a lesbian for awhile, oh I think I will become friends with rich drug dealers, oh well I am over that part of my life now.  I do agree with her that too many non-violent criminals are locked up....society would be better served by large fines and community service.  Nothing positive comes from incarcerating people like Piper, Martha Stewart, and most white collar felons.  I found the women and the prison friendships fascinating and uplifting.  It is amazing that the human spirit can find meaning and exist in the most adverse conditions.  By the end of the book, I really  liked and cared for Piper.
0525953728|5.0|great book. very well written. first book I have read in over 30 years.  it kept my interest. great job
B00005JPKE|4.0|Good WWII flick from the Japanese perspective.  Good action scenes. Tactics from the Japanese general interesting. The Battle for Iwo Jima caused heavy losses on both sides.. .Clint Eastwood allows all sides to see &#34;war is hell&#34;.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|One of the major refrains in David and Goliath is that strengths can also be weaknesses, and this is an apt way to sum up Gladwell's approach to science writing. Most readers will know what they are getting into: a simple, intuitive thesis; interesting biographies and historical anecdotes, and a survey of some interesting social science articles. By these standards, the book is a success. David and Goliath was pleasant to read and there are a few underappreciated ideas that readers will appreciate.<br /><br />My complaint is not with the book itself, but what it's trying to accomplish. Books like this one err on the side of caution, and having read most of his work, I have the sense that Gladwell is reluctant to challenge his readers. The obvious response is that I am missing the point; it's not fair to judge books like this one to the standards of an academic journal. Still, when we look to the top-tier of popular science writing, I don't think it's unrealistic to expect a book to be both entertaining and somewhat rigorous.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Not kid friendly. A little too scary for kids and too far off of the original. I would not recommend this for a family film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse Bueaty she is the best horse I have ever had she is really the best ever
B006PZBR8S|4.0|This movie gets 4 stars only because of the language. If there was no cursing I would give it 5. This has a great story and is action packed. Rock n' Sock em Robots super sized and brought to life! Hugh Jackman does an excellent job transforming from a dead beat dad into a loving father. As a father myself and loosing my own father when I was 26 years old, this movie brought tears to my eyes. Very inspirational, just beware of the language with the young ones.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and addicting game. Great animation and sound effects, dynamic stages, colorful background, various tools with fun effects, and the most important thing is, you run as a MINION!! and there are a bunch of costume with different abilities, how adorable! Would recommend to anyone, whether you saw the movie or not!
B00622B3MY|3.0|This movie is good but it just does not compare to the first one. The story is a bit more complex and harder for kids to understand so comparing to the first one, its Ok.
1451695195|1.0|Does not boost your faith if you believe in Jesus.  ( I don't know why Lisa Whelchel endorsed it.)  Alexander and his wife consult a new age follower to find answers...I ended up throwing my copy away.  Instead read &#34;Waking up in Heaven&#34; and &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34;.  They tell about an amazing personal God!
B00E0SX118|5.0|We watch this movie frequently as a family. It just doesn't get old. The visuals in this movie spur the imagination of both children and adults.
B006GP3SGG|2.0|This particular reissue of it had very poor fidelity.  I cannot even stand to listen to it a 2nd time and have reordered it through Ebay by another label.  This label from Amazon should not be sold, it is poor to listen to.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Rainbow, I am seriously hating on you (80's or 90's slang?).  How dare you end it that way.  No epilogue, even.  You have to write a novella.  Otherwise, I'll put you on my Susanne Collins hate list for her WORST ENDING EVER lone category. (I seriously rewrote my own ending.) I love your book and am so glad I bought it.  I usually pay no more than $4 on indi authors.  The rare find of a full-price author is a big deal in my reading closet.<br />Thank you for your books, you'll be making more money off of me!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|You have to read them all once you start, but this one just did not keep my interest like the first two.  It just seemed to drag on, I almost felt like Suzanne was adding so much more detail the she did in the first two, when she should left it out.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|when ever I am a little down in the dumps I can put on an episode of big bang theory and watch the antics and it always lifts my spirits!! great sitcom.
