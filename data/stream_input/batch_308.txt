B00003CWPL|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first released. When it came out, it was only shown in three cities from my understanding - NYC, Los Angeles, and Ann Arbor, MI near where I live. I read the description in the Ann Arbor Film Co Op Guide ( I used to travel from Plymouth to A Squared every week back then while a teen to see the coolest foreign non-Hollywood films with encouragement from my HS teacher who taught Approaching the Arts), and the description said, \\"...a coherent plot description is useless...\\". I knew I had to see it. It is the most bizarre, weird, strange, wild film I have ever seen. I loved it then, and love it today.<br />It's my understanding that this was his senior project while attending Film School in NY. He went on to direct Dune and create twin peaks.<br />My only wish is that this film be available in DVD on amazon.com.<br />This film will be known as one of the top ten cult classics of all time, IMHO. - Student B.
B00005IC2H|3.0|wow, this is the most awesome, utterly beautiful music i have ever heard. i have seen most of these songs performed live- 5 thru 8, and i have to say i have never been so impressed by anything, as someone who owns and hears an enormous amount of music. the vocals, perfect, the guitar, like a wall of onrushing sound, the percussion minimal and simple, the bass, climbing and billowing out, the strings, perfectly timed. buy this. now. or download it. it doesn't matter. get the music, find the next concert near you and GO.
0316666343|4.0|To me, no book can be a bad book or not worth reading. If it was &quot;bad&quot;, then it would not have been allowed to be published for thousands of people to read and critisize. But, I will say that the Lovely Bones was not the best book I've read. I thought the author had a wild imagination and came up with bizarre things to write about, which is a good thing. On the other hand, for me, the style of writing was not adept. It was too fragmented and choppy, hopping from story to story. In the end though, the lesson to be learned from The Lovely Bones is one to always remember. Even though I was not flabbergasted by the novel, I will always remember it.
B000002OCP|4.0|While I prefer the younger, funkier Muddy Waters with his moaning voice in full swing, this album is by no means the abomination that it has been lambasted as for so many years. In fact, I prefer it to the much-hyped &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; Waters-partial Butterfield Band team-up of several years later.<BR>   <BR>   Is it experimental? Sure, there's plenty of 60's fuzz, reverb/echo and effects going on here.<BR>   Is it still blues? Absolutely, blues is not defined as an idiom by the way one amplifies guitars or filters vocals.<BR>   Is it good? Yes, in fact it apporaches greatness at several points in the album, particularly when compared to the &quot;classic&quot; albums of rock psychedelia of its era.<BR> <BR>   If you enjoy Muddy Waters with his bands and dislike late 60's rock and roll, you will not like this album. Unfortunately, most of the blues critics of the time fell into this catagory and hence this album's ridiculous reputation. If you can see beyond the rigid catagorization of musical artists, this album is for you.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Why this fabulous talent is not one of the hottest pop stars in the US, as he is in his native UK, will forever remain a mystery to me. His talent knows no bounds, as this fifth album aptly shows. From his released-as-a-single \\"Come Undone,\\" which is simply classic Robbie, to the intense \\"Feel\\" to the enigmatic \\"Me and My Monkey,\\" to all the emotions he can express like no other, Robbie has come up with another winner.<br />The first time I listened to this CD all the way through, I had it piped through the windows at full blast--while I planted a rose. It was one of life's better experiences. Those who know and appreciate the depth of this incredibly versatile (and very sexy) man will completely understand. No genre is beneath--or beyond--Robbie's notice, and he has opened up my eyes and ears to whole new musical experiences, time and time again.<br />For those who have not treated themselves to a CD by Robbie Williams, \\"Escapology\\" is a perfect place to start. For the rest of us, there's more Robbie to appreciate and love.
B0000508U6|4.0|The first time I saw Coldplay live there were not more than 50 people in the audience. They were the opening act on the NME Tour 2000 and I had made a point of getting there early in order to check them out. Reviews had made reference to the influence of Jeff Buckley, a hero of mine, and I had to see this for myself. I wasn't disappointed.<BR>The second time I saw them was the week before 'Yellow' was released as a single. Sort of a taster for this album. It is a sell-out gig upstairs at Manchester University. The band play 'Yellow'. And I remember standing there with this huge grin on my face thinking 'This Is As Good As It Gets'...<BR>The fact that I haven't seen Coldplay live since is probably down to carelessness on my part more than anything else. I love this album.<BR>'Don't Panic' is the perfect opener to any album. Insistent, rhythmic, tugging music; melodies that make you feel a song in a physical way. A pulling and restlessness in your stomach or simply goosebumps. And that voice. Chris Martin's singing may well be influenced by Jeff Buckley, hardly a bad thing, but there's a tone there which is all his own. And beautiful. Above all else this is music which makes you feel.<BR>'Shiver' is obsessive-lover-as-borderline-stalker but still remains this masively uplifting experience. The way the song builds and moves up to its stunning finale. By the end of the song you're almost convinced that that level of obsession is normal. And perfectly healthy. Strange.<br />'Spies' was the opening song at that second Manchester gig and it struck me as a curious choice at the time. Now I would have to disagree. It is beautifully paced and a work of delicacy. A study in effective simplicity. &quot;And the spies came out of the water...&quot;. Lovely.<BR>Next is 'Sparks', the proverbial grower, followed by the double-whammy of 'Yellow' and 'Trouble'.<BR>'Trouble' is the piano ballad you can admit to liking without actually hating yourself but it is on 'Yellow' that all theelements that make any Coldplay song special come together and reach fruition. On first listen this sounded so natural and so unforced. As if it had been delivered whole from some other world. Immaculate. I'll repeat the word 'unforced'. Because I believe that if the band had thought for one second about what they were doing here, the magic would have been undone and lost. The magic inherent in this beautiful, beautiful song.<BR>The snippet that is the title-track is again a triumph of delicacy and poise. And I love 'High Speed'. I love this album.<BR>So why only 4 stars?<BR>Well, because by the time this album was released I already had four of the tracks on singles ( admittedly two, 'Don't Panic' and 'High Speed', were re-recorded and improved upon... )but more importantly, whenever I listen to it I can't help but feel that the whole thing just peters out. The final two tracks, the second of which is uncredited on the sleeve, just disappoint me so much. I've lost track of the amount of times that I've gone stright back to play 'Don't Panic' again, to reassure myself that this is great music.<BR>And then I realise how pernickety and harsh I'm probably being here when the two words I've repeated over and over again, like a mantra, throughout this review are beauty and love. I do, I do. Four and a half stars then...
0345451325|5.0|The author Eric Nyland did a great job writing this fantasy/action book. You keep interest all through out the book, none stop action with great vocab that pulls you in. The book takes place on a planet called Reach and a couple other planets. The main character name is John (Spartan 117) he was picked up as a child by captain Keys of the human military. His purpose was to make super soldiers called Spartans, faster, stronger, faster, and smarter than regular humans soldiers. All of these efforts are to fight a war with an evil alien race called the covenant. And by the way it takes place before the Xbox game, so you not confused.
B0000542D2|4.0|If you're a Beatles fans, you must buy this DVD:  It has many new interviews and snippets never seen before.  However, the producers missed the boat in several CRITICAL areas:<br />1.  The soundtrack is in MONO and at the wrong speed.  Check out &quot;And I Love Her&quot; == it's one key too low.  They should have taken advantage of DVD capabilities and offered the sound in MONO, STEREO, and 5.1 SURROUND.<br />2.  Outtakes such as &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; were excluded -- inexcusable!<br />3.  Just like the &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; DVD, you should have the option of &quot;Music Only.&quot;<br />Nice try by the producers, but they overlooked several very key opportunities.  This DVD will ultimately be replaced by a superior version -- it's just a question of when, not if.

B000001ESN|5.0|Permanent Waves(1980). Rush's 7th studio album. <br />With the last two albums, A Farewell To The Kings(1977) and Hemispheres(1978), Rush ended the decade with a bombastic and progressive bang. Many feared that if they were to commercialize their sound a bit, the band's style would suffer. Permanent Waves immediately put that worry to rest. As many have said, PW is the first foray into shorter, more sophisticated songwriting, and yet it's not a complete departure from their earlier albums either. It acts as more of a bridge between eras. There are still a couple of long epics which hint back towards other albums, but at the same time there are now a couple of \\"Simple-for-Rush, complicated-for-radio\\" bill-board hits to go along with them. <br />PW has many different lyrical themes interspersed throughout the album, such as love, state of society, choices, and even the topic of music itself. I know that many people can interpret what each song means far better than I can, but I will provide a brief explanation of the tracks, so please bear with me. Here's the breakdown track-by-track: <br />1) The Spirit Of Radio- One of the two big radio hits. This song talks about the comparison of musical sincerity to the illusion of integrity that fame can create. Everything about this song is excellent, from the riff-filled intro, to the chorus midsection, and even the soft-section towards the end. It also contains one of my favorite Rush lines: \\"All this machinery making modern music can still be openhearted. Not so coldly charted it's all just a question of your honesty...\\" 10/10 <br />2) Freewill- Phenomenal radio hit, with some of Geddy's best vocals and a memorable solo by Alex. This was the first Rush song I'd ever heard, and so it helped to get me into the band. Lyrically, it's about the freedom of choice and its multiple consequences. Another priceless line can be found here: \\"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.\\" 10/10 <br />3) Jacob's Ladder- A slow, thematic epic number about the nature of thunderclouds. The lyrics don't really carry the song, as there aren't that many, but the instrumentation is what this track is all about. Alex plays his best guitar work on the album right here, with synths that add extra depth. One of Rush's greatest overtures. 10/10 <br />4) Entre Nous- Another top-notch track, this one is about interaction of people towards one another. Not very popular among Rush fans, but often considered deep down to be a fan-favorite. It has a strong guitar/vocal melody in the verses, complemented by an acoustic chorus section. 10/10 <br />5) Different Strings- A mellow acoustic break from the hard-rock pace of the rest of PW. The theme here is love. Although this song doesn't stand out as much as the others take note that Geddy is the one who writes the lyrics here. Neil's the king at songwriting, but still Geddy proves that he can stand on his own very well. 9/10 <br />6) Natural Science- THE BAND'S BEST LONG EPIC EVER WRITTEN! This track is about the views of a society from afar. Rush has written many long epics over the past several albums, but in my opinion, they peaked here as far as creativity goes. It starts off with the sound of a calm ocean tide followed by an acoustic section. Not long thereafter, it breaks into an all-out hardrocker, filled with frantic bass-lines, guitar riffs, frantic drumming, and effective vocals. It splits into several different time-signature changing sections, and then finally ending with the sound of a full ocean tide. Not as long as Cygnus X-1 or 2112, but still one of Rush's finest moments of their entire career. 10/10 <br />PW may be only six tracks long, but the content within it is unrivaled, consistent, and far and beyond some of the best work Rush has ever done. Unlike their other albums, there isn't a single weak moment on here. PW gets five stars hands down. While Moving Pictures(1981) may be named the best Rush album by numerous fans, PW has to live inits tall shadow, and it carries most all of its strengths without being over-hyped like MP is. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY AND EVERY RUSH FAN OUT THERE. BEGINNERS SHOULD START HERE. Still, don't think that this is the only album worth checking out though, as there are numerous equally enthralling efforts spread out over the course of the last three decades. I know that there is no such thing as a perfect album, but as far as this band's work goes, PW is the closest to being perfect as a Rush album can get.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Many say this CD is too long.  Yet everyone disagrees on which songs should've been left off - for every hated song, it's someone else's favorite!<br />Everybody Finds Out is the most exciting Fleetwood Mac song I've ever heard.  It sends chills up and down my spine!<br />Come is my 2nd favorite.  I love that Fleetwood Mac has grown in unexpected and sonically pleasant ways.<br />  My review will become too long if I list all the great songs, so let me just say that SAY YOU WILL contains absolutely the best collection of Nicks songs found on any FM record.  <br />  It's like getting a new Buckingham record (finally, a followup to the brilliantly beautiful Out Of The Cradle) with Nicks singing backup, as well as a new Nicks record featuring the best producer and guitarist she's ever worked with.<br />  Not that the whole thing is like 2 seperate solo albums.  You definitely get that group sound in several songs, most notably Peacekeeper and Say You Will.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers tells the story of Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division during World War II. This tale is not one that can be summed up in a 2.5 hour movie, but an 8 hour series. Though this is a long and expensive one, Band of Brothers will keep you on the edge of your seat with anticipation, and will fight yourself for dry-eyes during more emotional scenes of the series.<br />The price and the time commitment are well worth it.
B00005JLEU|2.0|What I heard most about this movie before I actually saw it was that it is a great story. The concept is interesting, the movie has great beginning but then it sort of wonders aimlessly to a point of actually being boring. Not in the same league as \\"Lion King\\".
B000060P79|5.0|Great album, I listened to I'd do anything and you don't mean anything and decided to get their CD...It's just awesome...Pierre's vocals are great, really in sync with their music...all the songs are cool, my favs are The worst day ever, meet you there, grow up (scooby doo sountrack) Addicted and <BR>I won't be there
B000002HRE|5.0|... This is one of greatest cds, definately a gem from Metallica. They don't come much better then this one. All of the songs are awesome, and this cd is great! People are saying that the album is bad filler, and Metallica were sell-outs for making this album and Load. Well people, just because you change your sound, it doesn't mean you're selling out. The album may have a much different feel than other works of Metallica, but it is still an awesome record. I am a true cd reviewer becuase I look at the album, and take it for what it IS. Not what it isn't, could have, or should have been.

B000007T2Z|4.0|This band using the same technique in repetition like John Cage or Edgar Varese to create a group musical ideas which build in tempo like a tidal wave that eventually crashes down on you with the final note. Soft but at the same time angry. Such mighty crescendos! Music that will make you weep. Aural music for the senses.
B00005JLRT|2.0|This film was an brilliant essay on the end of twentieth century science fiction, as it regurtitates old archetypes in (what it hopes is) a new way. Take the Remans, for example. What are they but Nosferatu wearing leather coats from the Matrix? By stealing from the roots of sci-fi (horror) and the style of new sci-fi (currently, leather) Rick Berman's crew proves that they're creatively bankrupt. And the clone of Jean-Luc Picard almost exists as if to brag, \\"So clones and baldness are cool now?  Well we did it first!\\"  Poor Brent Spiner in his pancake makeup proves eloquently that a new coat of paint won't fix the basic problem--that Trek is dead--a point further proved when they uncover his new \\"brother\\" in the stripmined desert wasteland of action movies (another false refuge for ailing sci-fi). Science fiction is good when it's about character--just like any fiction. Heck...it was Star Trek that proved that the science doesn't have to be good for the story to be there (way back when Bones declared that the self-replicating tribbles were \\"bisexual\\"). Trek had some great moments, like Data defending his free will in \\"The Measure of a Man\\" and that time the doctor told Jeri Ryan he had to check out her \\"implants.\\" But the sad desire to milk what was once good reflects what's happening to all outmoded space-ship driven Sci-Fi, and makes Nemesis embarrassingly bad. When Jean-Luc Picard is fighting a younger version of himself...what are we to take it for? Good writing? How about a metaphor for a sickly genre fighting its own old age? If you want to see cool characters wearing leather outfits standing against a hazy green backdrop, forget Trek, or even Patrick Stewart's other burgeoning franchise...Save your money folks. Buying Nemesis is like taking the blue pill--and choking on it.
0688163173|5.0|Shutter Island came to me by accident; I ordered a different book, the bookstore sent this one, then discovered their mistake and told me to keep it anyway. So I read it - and became instantly engrossed, as well as an instant fan of Dennis Lehane.<br />The plot revolves around the investigation into the almost magical, surely impossible disappearance of a woman from a heavily guarded hospital for the criminally insane. Set in the milieu of the 50s, that decade of The American Dream, there's an inherent innocence at play in the background, a sense of truth, but something dark and maybe deadly is going on. Then comes the threat of a hurricane and a prison riot...<br />It'll keep you up all night, no lie.
7119005901|5.0|I am a normal 15 year old boy who likes china.  And let me tell you somthing this book is the best book ever!! It has a huge stand point on war and art. This book is the Unabriged version and has a lot of names but you will get the main people in the story. For any of you who have played the viedo game, forget everything you know because it's alot different. I give this book 5 out of 5. The version should be bought because Robert Moss has about 200 pages of helpful quotes, pictures, and maps.
B000005IU2|5.0|Maybe the most influential album by the most influential band in the history of contemporary rock music? The ultimate in punk,metal, funk and jazz. Any fans of these genres should apply. Their self titled debut, Raw Power and the early Iggy Pop solo efforts are also worth seeking out.

The direction by Jean-Pierre Jeunet is the perfect balance of sound and color. From the very start you are immersed in the world of Amelie, a girl who realizes that there is more to life than what you and me consider important. Through her unconventional selfless acts she manages to better the lives of those around her...but does she have the courage to follow her dreams and better her own life?
B00008S2VH|3.0|Madonna must think she can get away with a lot nowadays. While the album is up to her usual standards, I can't recommend spending the extra TEN DOLLARS for the enhanced CD. What's different?<br />It has a nice pretty box<BR>It has a poster inside.<BR>The enhanced CD has an 'exclusive' link to her website. That's it. On the website is a link to a 'making of' video of American. However, it's nothing more than the song dubbed over a collage of images. No interviews, no behind the scenes.. nothing. Just a TEN DOLLAR link to her website. Save your money and go for the
B000007R1M|5.0|Germans with keyboards create disco music that actually rocks!!!! Post modern rock at it's finest. Elements of Philip Glass and other minimalistic composers can be found in this music. Kraftwerk and their peers like Neu and Faust helped to define this whole new musical genre and even assisted in prefiguring other generes like rap and hip hop. Great album and like their earliest stuff higly recommended.
B00000J7JO|4.0|i just recently became a fan of the chili peppers, and started listening to all of their music that i could get a hold of. californication is the best cd that the band has put out thus far. it is one of them cd's that u can listen to and only skip a few. this is what separates this cd from being one of the best ive heard from any band.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Too all the People who think that this album is nothing? Well you were wrong, I loved it. and the CD itself is not that bad.  I love the song, I'm So Stupid, and Easy Ride; I see Grammies in Madonna's future for next year.
B000059TPI|5.0|Has there ever been another American actor who could have turned in two such dissimilar brilliant performances in one year as James Stewart did in 1950 with &quot;Harvey&quot; and &quot;Winchester 73&quot;?  It's hard to believe the same person could inhabit the two roles.  Stewart's range as a leading man was quite phenomenal and we see a side of it in &quot;Harvey&quot;, pure comedy, that he didn't get enough of in his remarkable career.  If only all dipsomaniacs were this amusing.  The whole cast is first rate, especially Jesse White as the asylum warder.
B000002G7E|5.0|This was Lou Reed and John Cale at their creative peak as a collective whole in my opinion. They reached a kind of spritual, rock nirvana that has been rarely equalled. Rock almost like free style jazz in the vein of John Coltrane or Ornette Coleman. Difficult but fascinating and an essential recording. So much that followed started here. Challening music for people who want to hear something that breaks down barriers which is what all good music should aspire to. click yes to buy now, click no and go look for the latest John Tesh release.
B000075BFK|3.0|alot of people have been hate'n on this album. i would like to clear this up for all the people who dont kno what they are talking about. this cd isnt bad at all, if anything it is kinda good. songs like still ballin, when we ride on our enemies, whatcha gunna do, and they dont giva a f@!k about us, are actually great songs with kick as* beats that a person could bump to. the people who gave this cd a any thing less than 3 stars just flew through all the songs and didnt give it a chance. the songs i listed above are the ones with the beats, all the others you hafta actually listen to the words. songs like fair exchange and street fame are examples of those. so go out and buy this cd, listen to it, and enjoy most likely the last cd put out by the legend, 2pac.
044022165X|5.0|I found this novel by John Grisham very entertaining.  I had a hard time putting it down until I was done reading it.  It kept me guessing about what was going to happen next and I would often guess wrong  Also having never read a book about lawyers before I learned a lot of new things that I would have never known out otherwise.  If you like stories about underdogs you will truely love this book.  Rudy is a true underdog in this story.  He is a just starting out lawyer whose first case is fighting a huge insurance company for 10 million dollars.  Not your typical first day on the job.  This book moves at a fast pace and my only complaint is that sometimes its hard to keep up.  But overall go get this book and it will not dissapoint.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is one of Madonna's best cds; its different and way better than anything out there right now; every song is great, highly recomended.
B00008S2VG|4.0|An improvement on the musically uneven MUSIC, Madonna's AMERICAN LIFE showcases even more of MUSIC producer Mirwais' French-house/ singer-songwriter-style. The result? Mirwais keeps it sonically trendy and adventurous, guiding Madonna's beautiful vocals through some of her best stick-in-your-head melodies.<br /><br />The CD is almost perfect, in my opinion. The only nagging weakness(es) is Madonna's simple and repetitive lyrics, coupled with her somewhat bored vocal delivery. They may not be enough to convince the listener--that Madonna has changed her mind about what's important in her life--but the songs are so darn good, you forgive it immediately. Still, AMERICAN LIFE works best if you approach it as Madonna's arthouse folk record (with electronica highlights). It is a musically consistent album, simple and obvious in its message.<br /><br />To get the full Madonna picture, you must also think about adding to your collection what I consider at-the-very-least purchases. The Debut Album, Like A Prayer, The Immaculate Collection, Something To Remember, Ray Of Light, GHV2 and Confessions On A Dance Floor are absolute essential for anyone getting into Madonna. I hope you enjoy Madonna's continuing legacy of great pop music!<br /><br />CUT TO...<br /><br />5.5 years later..Nov. 2008. While I still respect AMERICAN LIFE for what it is--Madonna's personal album--it is probably the least listened to album in my Madonna collection. Throughout, Madonna sounds bored, the production uninspired (MUSIC Pt II but not as good) --no real must-hears on the album. I'll re-rate it today at 3 stars instead...
B00008S2VG|4.0|I love Madonna and this album deserves 5 stars, like everyhting else she's put out, she can never go wrong, but I give it four for the lack of inventiveness in its packaging.<br />The pictures are boring, I don't care what phase or mood she's going through I still want good pictures of her no matter if she's old looking or anything.<br />The other thing is the lyrics. come on, I hate this trend cd's have now where you have to pay extra or go to a web page to get them.  I personally like to see also the credits to the songs individually with the names of the people who play or sing back up etc...<br />The CD is not commercially friendly this time around but its excellent none the less.  A few songs that could be radio hits are, Nobody Knows me, Nothing Fails, Mother and Father, Intervension and maybe Love Profussion.<br />I hope she stays away from the violence too, She was doing alright in the Ray of Light days, not 'til What it feels like for a girl and her tour and now American Life where she's going violent.  Even if its to make a point she shouldn't promote it, sarcastically or otherwise.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I've always appreciated Madonna's POP sensibilities but never really loved much of her music.  (I still say  &quot;Physical Attraction&quot; is one of her best songs. ) However, the first half of AMERICAN LIFE is pretty darn great.  Although, her lyrics are about as sophisticated and self-absorbed as a 15 year old, she still pulls it off with excellent phrasing, great melodies and mixing/producing.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This film is so good how can anybody give it a bad review the music is so awesome in my opinion one of the best scores written for a musical , and the direction is sublime , Catherine and Renee are fantastic and Richard Gere was born to play Billy Flynn , I love it and If you love musicals then you will too.
B000002U9W|2.0|whilst not a great album when compared to what came after, Atom Heart Mother is a humouress album evoking a somewhat folky feel, where even the brass band feels welcome. It doesn't stand up to repeated listens, as it is perhaps a novely album, though Rick Wright's Summer '68 is the highlight here, and feels more like the Floyd we know. Fat Old Sun is another number which is pleasant, though hardly earth moving.
038572179X|3.0|Briony is an imaginative child,  an aspiring author.  Her fantasies usually revolve around heroines, falls from glory and happy endings.  Performing her dramas is also one of Briony's passons and \\"The Fall of Arabella\\" was to be the latest production, done in honor of her college-age brother's return from school.<br />The description of the preparations, including role rehearsals by less-than-talented cousins, easily enamor the reader to precocious Briony.  That changes dramatically when one of her cousins, Lola, is ... assaulted shortly after Briony witnessed an intimate scene between her sister Cecelia and a would-be lover, Robbie Turner. <br />Robbie Turner is the son of the Tallis family's charlady and has been a favorite of the head of the Tallis household...so much so that Robbie has been college educated by the senior Tallis and he has also agreed to fund Robbie's subsequent medical education.  As an aside, it is interesting to see that the British social structure is such that Mrs. Tallis finds such financial backing of someone from the servant class to be inappropriate.  For that matter, the education of her eldest daughter, Cecelia, seems a waste of money as well.  The quest for an appropriate husband is far more important!<br />Briony utilizes her flair for the dramatic and her penchant for heroics to decide that Robbie has assaulted her sister and the dark figure she witnessed running away from her cousin's assault scene could be no other than Robbie.  He is arrested, even though Briony immediately begins to doubt her own pronouncements, and Robbie spends several years in prison.<br />Time is then propelled forward to Robbie's participation in World War II and the flight from Dunkirk.  Cecelia is a nurse and Briony is a nursing student, exposed to the brutalities of war as critically injured men are returned from the front.  Briony lives the full brunt of her guilt, knowing full well who her cousin's true assailant is.<br />The ending of the story takesan interesting turn and it is for the reader to discover.  Briony is in her seventies; she knows that her life is nearing its end.  She is a famous author with a book that cannot be published during her lifetime.  Therein lies the twist and the reader is left to his/her imagination!<br />The story is slow moving at times and is more interesting through the war years, Briony's final confrontation of her own guilt and the destruction she has caused within her own family.
B000002V0Q|4.0|First of let me say that Metallica (my favorite band) made a dumb decision.Dave Mustaine was the best songwriter they ever had. Now that I got that out of the way let me say that this is a &8%$ing masterpiece. Really good metal. Really easy to get into,a lot better than peace sells...but who's buying. This Disk also has some great lyrics. (hello me..meet the real me..)<BR>(Hello me it's me again)(Well me it's nice talkin' to myself). I guess it's obvious that dave was on some hard drugs at the time. It does have some really good songs though (psychotron, captive honour, ashes in your mouth) this is a good disk to get into Megadeth. Peace sells is too...indie sounding(like metallica's kill em all)To sum it all up..... BUY IT USED!IT GOES CHEAP!
B00005JLSC|5.0|with an awesome jazz score , amazing performances , it's hard not to love Chicago , It's just so funny and alot of fun! If you like musicals and just a fun movie you will adore this wonderful film.
B000024D4R|4.0|often overlooked, this 1977 album released at the height of punk is one of the best Waters era Flod albums. Pigs on the wing is refreshing in its simplicity, whilst thrills are to be had on tracks like sheep, but more so dogs and pigs, which are two of the most powerful songs in the band's catalogue. That said, the length of the songs don't make this their most accessible album, but if your finding the Wall enjoyable (esp tracks like Run Like Hell and In the Flesh) then give this a try
0440237688|4.0|Life-long care.  A highly structured, advanced society where everyone has a role and no one has a need to rebel.  That is the environs into which Jonas is born.  Every year of his life, in the life of any inhabitant of this unnamed city, there is an assigned role with accompanying tasks, an obligatory training to prepare for the twelfth year in which a person receives her or his life's profession.<br />In such an idyllic location it is interesting to note that those who are assigned to give birth are looked down upon; after two years of giving life to babes who will be subsequently assigned to parents who are allowed only one boy and one girl, the woman is assigned to various other chores.  She is a lifegiving machine who maintains the population of the community but her ensuing role is that of some type of common laborer.  No rewards for this profession!<br />There are those who do the cooking and deliver meals to all of the inhabitants, those who clean up after the food has been ingested and trays left outside the home, those who are teachers, those who are nurturers, those who are caregivers to the elderly and those who are assigned legal tasks.  The penalty for non-compliance, or non-conformity, is \\"release\\".  By itself the word is innocuous enough.  What it actually means, is hazy.  Finally, at some point in time the elderly must be released and the decision is made for them.<br />Big Brother is always watching and reminders are issued via an intercom.  Faults and mis-steps seem to be gently dealt with but \\"release\\" is the ultimate verdict once a certain amount of opportunities for correction have elapsed.  Dreams are processed each day as are feelings of anger, hostility, frustration.  Reasons for behaviour are evaluated and the reason appears to be that if feelings can be processed a homeostasis will always return.  Lying is strictly forbidden...until....<br />When the twelfth year finally arrives, a bizarre occurrence takes place.  Jonas and all his contemporaries who are about to turn 12, are called to an auditorium at which time they revert to the numbers they were originally assigned, prior to the \\"name giving\\" that occurred when they were officially presented to their selected parents.  Jonas is not called to the stage when his number is called.  He is shocked as are all the members of the town who are present for this important occasion.<br />The reason for the slight becomes apparent when Jonas receives the highest honor possible, he will become \\"The Receiver\\".  His studies with the present Receiver reveal a far-from-perfect society and it is each subsequent Receiver who must be the recipient of the painful memories of the past.  This takes its toll on each honoree as s/he literally bears the weight of the world in order to alleviate the town's folk from having to do so.<br />Jonas gradually rebels and takes dramatic steps to escape what is not at all idyllic.  Let the reader discover this moral tale.  The novel is well done and can easily appeal to adults and adolescents alike.  The fortunate adolescents will have adults with whom to review this book as it has many painful, ethical, moral issues to be discussed!
B00005ARDC|3.0|I think that this could be potentianly a good band.  The music is good, but a bit monotonous.  There isn't really a climax because most of the music sounds the same- lots of drums, heavy bass, and glances of harmony.  The lyrics, while some of them are good (Too Real, White Palms, Spread Your Love)they also seem to have no direction and are about redundant topics (ex: Love, Rock and Roll)  This album is like a cake that has the ingredients but isn't baked yet.  These guys may be good a couple of albums from now.  Download it, buy it, or keep a mental note about BRMC.
0743455967|5.0|Living in Maine for 25 years may not qualify me as a real \\"Mainer\\", because the standards for this elite title are very strict, but my tenure in Stephen King's home gives me some exposure to the life story told in \\"On Writing\\". What a clever way to tell fans and the otherwise curious about how a very poor young man who went to school in tiny Pownal, Maine and who later worked as a janitor for nearby Brunswick High School became a world famous super-writer. Among all the reviews I've read about Stephen King's very candid account of the writing craft, I'm still looking for one that tells the truth about the story itself. I am so very impressed by how King is able to paint his life as a Mainer (he passes the test, being born in the state) and transmit the colorful pictures of people and places in exactly the way they really are. Other than the love King expresses for his wife and family, there's no romanticism in \\"On Writing\\". Still, in the absence of any embellishment, King writes a wonderful and inspiring story for everyone who either wants to be a writer or who wonders what stuff the crafters are made of. Kudos to the University of Maine where King's writing talent was validated by the English Department professors.  There's a parallel story in \\"On Writing\\". Indeed, the book's title is hyphenated, \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft\\", because this is an autobiographical way of saying what seems right, or not so right, about writing. Thankfully, it's a lovely read and not at all self gratifying or congratulatory in any way. As a matter of fact, the story King tells ends with a chilling rendition about his tragic accident while walking along the road in Western Maine. King doesn't take a minute to indulge in self pity, despite having a very close brush with death as a result of the accident. There's a rhetorical question raised, of course, about how we would have known about those rats in the cellars of the mills in Lisbon Falls or those tampons in the girl's gym in Brunswick High School and how these experiences inspired \\"Carrie\\" and other horror tales. If King had not been spared and survived his tragedy, we would not have the joy of knowing what it's like to live inside the mind of a creative writing genius. Thanks so much, Stephen King, for \\"On Writing\\". It's a book everyone can read to appreciate your creativity and the deep respect you obviously hold for the craft of being a hard working writer.
B000006TRV|3.0|Whilst the Wall film took itself too seriously, the music version offers a much more pleasurable experience. Besides the singles, there are some real understated gems tucked in here - \\"goodbye blue sky\\" and \\"mother\\" - which stand up to the most repeated listens. Aides from these songs, a lot of the album is often too theatrical and only really gels when listened to in its entirity. This isn't Floyd's best and some tracks (the trials) do wear a bit thin after repeated listen. It's more an album you just put on for a few songs.
0761536434|5.0|If you've read the other reviews first, they say it all.<BR>This book is brilliant, well researched, and covers pretty much all you would want it to. It is written in a riveting fashion too- If you love video games and its history, you just won't want to put it down. It is without doubt the best book you can buy on video games, from a quality of how it's written, and information point of view.<BR>However, I put the book 'High Score!- The Illustrated guide' slightly higher, as I love the coffee table layout, and the many beautiful and rare photographs.Comparing the two is very hard; they are different styles of book really, one with depth, one with style. I personally found it impossible to pass up either once I knew they existed. Together, you have the best set of video game guides, and two of the four 'must own' books on video games available. (Ultimate guide, High Score Illustrated Guide, Phoenix: Fall and Rise of Video Games, Game Over: Nintendos History).<BR>If you are picking only one book on video games for your shelf however, it's definately down to the first two- Dependant on whether you need the full depth story or great photographs. I can't see any fan on gaming history passing up either. Just wonderful.
B00003CXB2|2.0|Undeniably, the most boring film, other than Quest for Fire, that I have ever sat through.  I know it has a loyal following and it's eluded me as to why.  A terrific cast, wasted in the wasteland. For 3+ hours we see the camels lope across the desert this way, and then back the other way.  It was painful to watch such beautiful scenery and great talent stagnating in a celluloid farce.
B000002U8G|3.0|After the misjudged 'angry disco' track of One Of These Days ( a better version appears on Delicate Sound of Thunder) , the band hit their stride on gloriously hippyish songs like Fearless, drawing on folk and Liverpool FC with it. San Tropez is fun, though slightly cheesy but things really go down hill with Seamus, a dull, white man's blues track which sounds very out of place. All is forgiven though, for Echoes - over 20 minutes of what Prog Rock should be - dreamy, pretentious, uplifting and chilled out, which never outstays it's time frame
B00009APK1|5.0|Hi :), this is one of the best movies ever, and is not the best one because I love The Fellowship of the Ring to, and because I'm going to love The Return of the King :).<BR>This movie is not only amazing in the history, the beautiful landscapes, and the totally impressive cast but is great because you can help but love it!! even is not exactly like the great books that Tolkien wrote it shows you a new world full of fantasy, adventure, courage, friendship and loyalty. Every character is truly developed and they are getting more interesting by the minute. The character of Golum rocks!!! there are moments when you just almost believe that is real. <BR>This movie is a MUST SEE!!!! in the theaters, in DVD and specially in the extended edition that I'm dying to see :).<BR>Be well and take care, and please take a look because if not you'll probably regret it :).
B00008CLOA|4.0|i bought this as i only had a vinyl copy of dark side which was hard to lug around. I once borrowed a mate's cd copy but decided not to buy as it seemed flat. origninally just getting this for the novelty of the cover and not really expecting a sound improvement i was impressed. it did seem like quite a bit has changed, with sound effects in the foreground. the quality is just like the rest of the CD catalogue, but the new mix has lifted areas, like the intro of money and such. Other areas have been toned down like the intro pulse (sounds like a drum rather than a pulse now) and the piano on us and them. i;m not too sure about some of this meddling, but for the whole it makes for a fresher sounding, more powerful version of the album (and still far better than the Pulse one). I just hope those SACD things go down in price, but for now i am happy.
B000069HK2|5.0|I've never really been into screamo music (even late Korn or Nirvana didn't seem to me to be screamo and ejoyed them quite a lot). But then I listened to this song \\"Poetic Tragedy\\" and it actually made me allucinate. How a song can be so agressive, yet so mellodic. It was nothing like I've ever heard... I mean those last 25 second where the singer mixes up emotional singing with screaming so strong that seems that his throat is actually burning, got me goosebumps.<br />But hold on the rest of the cd, with \\"Say days Ago\\" being the lowest point in my opinion, The Used self-named debut, makes me jump, sweat, feel alive and scream. I find myself singing parts of \\"The Taste Of Ink\\" unconciously, \\"Bulimic\\" and \\"Buried Myself alive\\" are the kind of tunes I need to start the day with energy. And on the ballad side, it's impossible not to be moved with \\"Blue and Yellow\\" and specially \\"On My Own\\". The other gem on the album is \\"Greener With The Scenery\\", specially due to its last part mixing up the kind of waltz beat, with Bret's voice flowing through the twisted melody of violins. Amazing.<br />Eventhough they quite fit into the clich&eacute; of \\"I'm-a-teen-so-I-should-feel-depressed-and-complain-about-everything\\" they do it so well that they're forgiven.<br />I don't even want to convince anyone of how great this cd is. To all of you who just love it as much as I do, you know what I'm saying. To the ones who don't, well... keep on trying.
B000002C1W|3.0|Though rooted in 80s sounds, Momentary is a pretty solid album. Signs of life is inventive and ecocative , whilst Learning to Fly is one of their mopst accessable and enjoyable tracks, showing that synths can be a force for good! Though it never actually sounds too much like Pink Floyd, the album is a hearty slab of space rock, which sould appeal to fans of Tangerine Dream's Legend soundtrack: it's mystical, but as long as you don't take youself too seriously, you should like it
B00008S2VG|4.0|This album does have an interesting mix of acoustic and techno that make it catchy and fun to listen to. This album is a meshing of pop tunes with a little rap here and there. My favorite tracks are American Life, Hollywood, and Mother and Father (which is the best track by far). I would say that this album is not as good as 'Ray of Light', but its far better than 'Music.' If you're a madonna fan like me, you're always looking for new madonna tunes, and this won't disappoint. She's not losing her touch yet.
B000002A3T|3.0|what realistically is their last album, Division Bell has real moments of excellence, notably Take it Back which seems to out-U2 U2 in its musical scope and comes off all the better for it. It's just one example of the akbum's flawless production, which really helps the album along. Some suffer from being quite dull (keep talking and marroned) though it comes into its own towards the end of the record, with Lost For Words displaying some wonderful folky solos and High Hopes really sums up the English countryside rather well in its nostalgic, romantic lyrics.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I just bought this at my local Border's Book Store. It won't play on my Dell Laptop - So I can't listen to it at work!<br />I looked for a warning on th package. It's in the super-fine print on the back, camouflaged by the background of the cover.<br />I don't recommend you buy it.
0385504209|5.0|I could not wait to turn the page and find out what happens next in this wonderful story.  Not only is it a great tale, but it challenges your mind.  This is a true puzzle that will keep you guessing until the end.  I read this book in one sitting, there was no way I was going to wait another second longer to unravel the truth behind the Da Vinci Code.  Brilliant.
B000000W5L|5.0|This album is, like most great albums of the vinyl era, so much more than a collection of singles.  It drips of blues, country, and hard rock.  I have multiple copies on LP in addition to the CD version, and I rarely go a week without listening to Mick, Keith, and the crew rip it up.  By engaging in very little post-production, the Stones give the album an absolutely raw and dirty aura.  Though never commercially successful singles, my personal favorites are &quot;Rocks Off&quot; and &quot;Loving Cup.&quot;  Exile On Main St. may be more of a blues and country album than rock.  The entire album, however, delivers more grit and dirt than anything else I own.  Check it out.
0786869143|2.0|Richard Wiseman heads a research unit in the psychology department at the University of Hertfordshire, so you'd think he'd know something about experimental methodology. Unfortunately, you'd never guess it by reading this book. Wiseman claims that his research has revealed that `the real explanation behind luck lies in four basic psychological principles'.   The selling point of `The Luck Factor' is these principles to can be used to `make unlucky people lucky, and lucky people even luckier.'   <br />The main difficulty with this claim is that at no  point in his book does Wiseman present any sort of objective test for `luck'.  Rather, his subjects classify themselves as `lucky' or `unlucky' (and he simply takes their word for it) or else they are classified by him as such based on their own subjective evaluation of the degree to which they share certain characteristics with people who see themselves as either `lucky' or `unlucky'.  Since the `four principles' are based on data about people who feel lucky, rather than people who are lucky in some objective sense, the only honest claim that could be made based on Wiseman's research is that some people who follow his `four principles' might begin to think of  themselves as luckier.   <br />The problem with using people's subjective evaluation of their own luckiness is revealed in an experiment (presented early in the book) to determine whether `lucky' people have more psychic ability than `unlucky' people. Seven hundred volunteers who phoned in upon viewing a particular television programme (Random population sample?  Why bother?) were asked to categorise themselves as lucky, unlucky or neutral based on how well they felt they matched Wiseman's `Lucky Description' or `Unlucky Description'.  Here's the Lucky description for reference (complete with grammatical errors):<br />\\"Lucky people are people for whom seemingly chance events tend to work out consistently in their favour.  For example, they seem to win more than their fair share of raffles and lotteries, or to accidentally meet people who can help them in some way, or their good fortune might play an important role in them achieving their ambitions and goals.\\"<br />All of the volunteers entered the same draw of the National Lottery, buying an average of three tickets each.   None of the subjects won more than £56 pounds (that amount was won by two participants, one `lucky' and one `unlucky').  On average both `lucky' and `unlucky' participants lost about £2.50.  Wiseman's conclusion: `The results indicated that luck wasn't due to psychic ability'. <br />The results indicate something entirely different to me.  The description of `lucky' specifically talks about winning lotteries.  Yet people who classified themselves as `lucky' according to this description didn't do any better at the lottery than those who classified themselves as `unlucky' (though `lucky' people's expectations of winning were more than twice as high as those of `unlucky' people).  This would seem to  indicate that the `lucky' people who participated in this experiment were anything but.  They may have been more optimistic, unrealistic, or self-deluding, but they weren't luckier.<br />Wiseman comments: <br />\\"When it comes to random events like the lottery, such expectations count for little.  Someone with a high expectation of winning will do as well as someone with a low expectation.  However, life is not like a lottery.  Often our expectations make a difference.  They make a difference to whether we try something, how hard we persist in the face of failure, how we interact with others and how others interact with us.\\"<br />That's all very true, but when Wiseman admits that expectations `count for little' when it comes to `random events' he is more or less admitting that they have nothing to do with luck.  <br />Wiseman goes on to analyse the characteristics of `Lucky' people (i.e. those who think they are lucky, but probably aren't any luckier than therest of us) and finds that they have several things in common.  Unsurprisingly, they expect good fortune and  they see the positive side to random events (for example, having just broken her leg in a freak accident, an `unlucky' person would say `It was bad luck' whereas a `lucky' person would tend to say `I'm lucky I wasn't killed').  <br />Much of the evidence given in this book is anecdotal and many of the anecdotes intended to illustrate someone's luck or lack thereof fail miserably.  Women who end up in successive abusive relationships are described as `unlucky in love', though choice, not luck, determines who we marry; and a person who gets involved with someone she doesn't fully trust is better characterised as `desperate' than `unlucky'.  Similarly, we hear anecdotes about `lucky' people who enter contests and win prizes.  We later learn that entering contests is their hobby and it's only because they enter so many that they win.  Statistical probability is involved here, not luck.   <br />But Wiseman doesn't hesitate to extract `ways to improve your luck' from these instances.  The women who are `unlucky in love' are meant to show how we can improve our luck by trusting our intuition.  (Despite the fact that they had blatant, as well as intuitive, indicators that their men were jerks).   The contest winners supposedly  illustrate that we can improve our luck by being more  persistent-- though I fail to see how increasing one's chances of achieving something through deliberate, persistent and calculated effort has anything to do with `luck'.   <br />I'm sure some of the clichéd suggestions in this book (e.g. positive thinking and networking) will help some readers (those who haven't heard it all before) to improve their chances of achieving their goals.  I  doubt any of them will help readers to improve their luck.   My opinion of this book would have been much higher if the author had straightforwardly framed his findings in terms of  `How to make the most of your opportunities.'  I really would like to read some properly conducted scientific research which addresses the question of whether some people are innately luckier than others and, if so, what characteristics they share.   Unfortunately,  Dr. Wiseman seems to have different interests.
B000031WD9|1.0|Yeah!!! Its ANOTHER teen movie.  I was persuaded to go and see this film on the promise that it had something new and fresh to add to the genre. This was a lie.  Jokes you can see coming from a mile off, Text book Farrelly brother gross-out, poor acting from the usual collection of potential teen stars, no plot, awful script and of course, sequels!!!<BR>Why, what was the point?
B00008S2VH|1.0|Madonna sings about controversy, about religion, about not being religious, ok...fine, what's so new and fascinating about it, it's not like she's trying to sell us something new and innovative. This is by far the worst album she's done. I'm not a fan but I have appreciated previous efforts (Like a Prayer, Ray of light). If you are planning on getting what your money's worth try getting the singles, perhaps all the innovation will be on her remixes or even videos, but as far as originality she is way out of her element.<BR>Seriously if you think this is evolution, think again. Someone who sings without believing what she's saying to the mic better go back to studio (I'm saying this based on the way she sings, tired, overly produced, again with the distorsion as her right hand).<BR>Madonna, be Madonna again, you have lost it this time!!!
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is a very romantic book and also has a lot of realistic experiences. This story takes place in a little town called Beaufort it is located in North Carolina. The main characters in this story are Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan. Other characters are Landon's parents Jamie's father and just other people like their friends. Jamie is the ministers daughter she is shy quiet but always very helpful to anyone and everyone. Landon on the other hand is a handful he is controlling and always wants his way. Landon's family is in the upper class and Jamie and her father don't have a lot of money. Landon and his family have been acquaintances with Jamie and her father for many years but Landon has never thought much of Jamie till recently at age seventeen. Jamie has been teaching Landon life lessons and just being around him a lot, since Jamie said she would help him in any way she made him promise that he wouldn't fall for her. He agreed with the promise thinking the only one who would fall for someone would be her falling for him, but he soon found out he was wrong. I don't always enjoy reading, unless I find a very interesting book. This book is the best book I have ever read and that is no lie! I honestly couldn't stop reading it, it only took me four days to read it. This book has no weaknesses only strengths. It has many different emotions/ and thoughts worked into it; happy times, sad times, suspense, and many parts where you just sit there and wonder what is going to happen next. I would rate this a ten if the scale was one through ten! You should read this book and hopefully if you have never heard of it or if you have and just decided not to read it you will now from just reading my book review
B00005LK94|5.0|&quot;Fly Away Home&quot; tells the story of Amy, a girl from New Zealand who has to stay with her father in Canada after her mother dies. During her time there she finds some goose eggs that later hatch. As soon as the geese hatch the first thing they see is Amy and so they imprint on her, thinking she is their mother. Due to the geese natural instinct to fly south, and the fact that they don't have their real mother to lead the way, Amy with the help of her father attempt to lead the geese south in their own hang gliders.<br />This is a very simple story done well, helping to create a pretty much perfect family movie. Jeff Daniels as Amy's father and Oscar winning Anna Paquin as Amy are equally fantastic, and I'd also like to give a shout out to Terry Kinney as Amy's uncle who is really quite funny. The directing by Carroll Ballard is brilliant and the cinematography is breathtaking and makes you feel like you are flying with Amy, her Dad and the geese. Not to mention the truly inspirational score by Mark Isham that is helping us along on our journey.<br />The DVD special features which although not necessarily entertaining are appropriately informative. And also, &quot;Fly Away Home&quot; has been digitally remastered and is presented in widescreen, so it's the best you'll see this movie. I suggest you fly to the store or internet terminal so you can buy this, before it flies off the shelves.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna has done it again. Every song on this album is great! Love the folky and acoustic songs and the dance tracks are great...
B000059MEK|5.0|this was the 1st time i had ever heard french-disco house. its hard to believe this is in the rave scene, but it is. I loved this cd right off the bat! the tunes are fresh and up-beat and it has a good dance cycle that keeps you moving and moving through the whole cd.
1580084621|5.0|This is the one. The definitive guide to Thai cuisine. Having lived in Thailand I can say that this book is destined to be a classic. Thorough is an understatement. Beautiful design and photography. The only fault is a disappointing Thai transliteration system devised by the author and no Thai script to back it up. But the average reader will have no use for Thai script anyway. This isn't a weekend cookbook, it's Larousse. And that's why it's great.
B000000WCV|5.0|after i bought discovery, i had to hear the album that got it all started. when i got homework, i shoved it into my cd player and loved what i heard. all the songs are really repetetive, but somehow, the beat just keeps making you dance. its a mixture of french-disco and french house music. Around the World is the best song on this album (mine got scratched, that song only!) but burnin' is a great song too with the same scratch being used over and over again. Revelution 909 is an awsome disco song that keeps you moving the whole 5 minutes. High Fidelity is another good song, you just cant understand what they aew saying. buy this cd if you are a fan of french-disco house music.
B00006LIRI|3.0|Can a band like U2 really get away with putting out compilation albums? Not really; the hardcore fans would never allow them to. There will always be complaints about compilations released by a band of this stature. They always center around the songs that were left off, particularly by those fans who feel this band owes them something. That's the equivalent of a hardcore fan going to see a band, and leaving disappointed because some &quot;obscure album track that was never a hit&quot; wasn't performed just for them. I remember going to PopMart in '97 and some guy next to me being bummed out because &quot;Indian Summer Sky&quot; wasn't on the setlist. Any complaints about this kind of petty thing is ultimately pointless. <BR>What WAS left off were tracks that would have made sense in a compilation like this. The omission of &quot;Please&quot; is inexcusable, as the song was a centerpiece of the PopMart tour, much more than &quot;Gone&quot; or even &quot;Staring At The Sun&quot;. Considering that the album version of &quot;Please&quot; was incomplete at the time of POP's release (listen to Bono's vocals on the album), we would have all had the definitive version of the song had this included the single version. Also interesting, even if included on the B-Sides cd, would have been &quot;The Ground Beneath Her Feet&quot; and the Clayton/Mullen rework of &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;, if only for completists' sakes. Looking at the track list of this &quot;Best of&quot;, it's obvious from the various different mixes and the omission of other big tracks (&quot;Walk On&quot;, anyone?) that this compilation is intended almost solely for the longtime U2 fans. Any casual fan wanting to pick up the singles they've heard over the years or the radio would have been VERY disappointed, &quot;Best of&quot; clearly NOT the same as &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.<BR>What is most alarming about this collection is the work that was done on the tracks off POP, released in 1997. After the album had been out, and considered by many to be a failure, it was revealed that one of the reasons the album was so odd was that with the PopMart tour booked, the album itself was rush-released UNFINISHED just to meet the deadlines. As a result some of the tracks were deemed sub-par by some of the members of U2. If the remixes on here are supposed to be the definitive, COMPLETE versions of these songs, then thank god for the original versions. Who knows what damage an album full of this kind of thing would have done to their career. &quot;Discotheque&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot; sound even more unfinished than the POP versions. &quot;Staring At The Sun&quot;, meanwhile, doesn't fare much better. The fact is that the original mix of these songs wasn't the problem the first time around. The songs themselves were the real issue. A thousand remixes couldn't make &quot;Staring At The Sun&quot; sound any less flat and uninspired than it already did. What would have worked better would have been the single versions of these tracks.<BR>On the plus side, the new tracks are brilliant, particularly the gorgeous &quot;Electrical Storm&quot;. U2 should consider William Orbit for their next album. He adds a warm, cinematic touch to the song, much like he did for the Madonna &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; album. For those fans who complain about having to get the &quot;Best Of&quot; CD just for two new tracks, the price is more than worth it for these two.<BR>Even with the omissions and the detours, this album is full of brilliant songs that should be a great listen to anyone interested in listening to one of the great bands of all time daring its audience to &quot;see colors that have never been seen, discover places no one else has been&quot;.
0156027321|2.0|Very lengthy book. It could have been made concise and to the point. The raft and the animals was a novel way of a kid surviving the pacific. Is it believable - definitely NOT. It is an adventourous book however, I will NOT reccomend to any family with children and/or kids. <br />After I bought the book and read it I was so upset with the ending - I threw the book away. In fact I discussed with my friends that it is time that Books too have a rating standard if publishers are willing to publish this gibberish. <br />To give credit- Martel starts the book very well and tells a new kind of adventure for young boys. After that it is all downhill.
B000002NZO|5.0|As soon as \\"they\\" gave these young guys REAL conditions to show the world their immense talent, they made up what I personally consider a masterpiece in the progressive area.     Those who have songs like The Musical Box, Cinema Show or Firth of Fifth as favorite ones in the Genesis catalog will probably feel the same way as I do after discovering this album. I've enjoyed \\"Trespass\\" since the very first listening and the main reason is clear: no moments like More Fool of Me mixed up between great musical songs. Homogeneous, you can listen to it with the same feeling from start to finish.    Therefore, I don't find it easy to point out highlights here. Ha well, maybe with 2 exceptions: \\"The Knife\\" (electrifying rhythm from the very first second, perfect miscellany of sounds in the middle part) and \\"Stagnation\\", a genuine classic from this band, as good for me as the 3 ones above mentioned.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Ok, Madonnas the best pop artist out there, 20 years of profession, bla bla bla. Listen, American Life is not as good as Ray Of Light but it is much better than Music (thats not very hard to outdo, acutally). This Cd is probably the most hard to get used to, because while Music capitalized dance pop and ray of Light tried to stay away from it, American life does both: we have the ballads, we have the dance tracks, we have acoustic sets, but everything is mixed up. The old sound is invaded by the new one, there are echoes of Like A Prayer or something pulled out of Bedtime Stories but at the same time it is like nothing youve heard before. Stand outs are the hipnotic/zen-like Nothing Fails, the Dont tell me Part II Hollywood, and the cool cant-fit-into-any-category Love Profusion. Dont hesitate to listen: Madonna keeps leading the Way.
B00008AY3L|4.0|Alright, I have experienced about all of Ben Harper's stuff and this CD although overall is great, but it does have some sore spots.  Songs like Temporary Remedy and Everything just don't fit into his type of style.  But that being said, Ben Harper is the king of diversity.  The songs range from a Bob Marley-ish reggae sound on With My Own Two Hands to the definately George Clinton inspired Bring the Funk to the African sounds of Picture of Jesus.  And all of them are good.  While I wouldn't recommend this CD to someone who wants to start getting into Ben Harper, after you can appreciate his style, this CD becomes a must have.
B00005221M|3.0|First off let me say how much I love this film, saw it in the theatres when it came out and immediately bought it on tape when it was available to buy.  That said the movie on DVD is drastically different from the film I saw on the big screen.  Director Michael Mann has taken out some of the best lines in the film, the cool asides that Daniel Day Lewis said, and though I can understand why he took them out there absence took something away for me.  Lewis's character is no longer the hero I enjoyed the first time I saw the movie, now he is just the<BR>strong silent type.  Maybe I am just a product of films such as Die Hard and The Terminator but I like a kind of cocky, self assured hero.  The Hawkeye of the original movie was that hero, this Hawkeye is not.<BR>     Secondly Mann decided to cut out some key scenes that built up the love between Daniel Day Lewis's character and Madeline Stowes character.  The love is still there but more subdued, taken down a level.  This I believe is another mistake because as a romantic at heart I really enjoyed the way the original movie pushed the romance.<BR>     The final note is a deletion of a great bit of music from the original version of this film.  During the scene where Hawkeye chases down Madeline Stowes character from the clutches of her Huron captors there used to be a very moving song.  Now it is gone, replaced with a low level, almost non-existant strum, of violins and drums.  Kind of takes the power out of what was once a very moving bit of film.<BR>     So in the end this move is still very good but I have to recommend the original version more.  So go get the film on VHS and then buy this one.  They are two completely different films even though they tell the same story and have the same cast.
B00005JLO2|1.0|This remake of a classic film is an abomination. Supposedly, the <BR>thrust of the changes was to remove \\"racist elements.\\" I have watched the original many times, and I don't see any racist elements, unless you consider the depiction of Africans kicking the ... out of the British Army to be racist. In the remake, a mysterious black bodybuilder guides Harry Faversham step by step through his odyssey. The Ralph Richardson character is reduced to a screaming idiot. Please, watch the original and throw this one in the roundfile.
0446310786|4.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is a great story that kind of reminds me of the movie, A Time To Kill.  It is a story that anyone, people of all ages, can enjoy.  It was also an inspirational story about the bravery of children and one man's desire to  defend a man who has almost no hope.<BR>    The story is about a family, whose father is a lawyer, defending a black man accused of raping a white woman.  It is told by the daughter, Scout.  Scout and her brother, Jem, are very close because they are both very curious kids.  They get all their information on what's going on with the trial by snooping around and talking to gossips from town.  Basically the story is about what the family goes through because of the trial, considering that back then most people automatically believed the white girl.  The town was not very supportive of Atticus 'choosing' to defend a black man.  The Finch family goes through a great deal of pain and strife because of this.<BR>    Because of reading this book, I feel more enlightened on the black/white issues of days gone by.  The book gives great detail to the innerworkings of the minds of white people back then.  The characters were very well-developed, the plot was definitely realistic, making the story very believable because chances are, something like that has happened.<BR>    I would definitely recommend this book to reader's of all ages.  It provides great knowledge of the unfair ways that white people used to treat black people, and still do to an extent.  I definitely feel that sometime in their lifetime, everyone should read To Kill A Mockingbird.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Well i've owned it since 1997 when it was released but have never written a review of it, but even all this time later this album still amazes me every time i listen to it. Like many people say, it will take many listens before you appreciate its genius but once you do you'll love it forever. Highlights for me are Electioneering and Climbing up the Walls, and The Tourist, which is without a doubt the best closing song on any album (even more than Street Spirit). Praise indeed.
B00005JLRT|3.0|Having followed the TNG cast since day 1, I think Star Trek fans will find Nemesis as a very satisfying ending to what was by all accounts a wonderful series.  That being said, I doubt non-Trek fans will find this installment of Trek very appealing.  <br />Producer Rick Berman was in charge of all four TNG movies (Generations, First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis) and as a fan I would rank this movie somewhere in between First Contact and Generations, with Insurrection being the worst of the four.  <BR>Berman and the Star Trek franchise got the formula right with First Contact.  It offered a solid story line with spectacular action, character development on all ends of the spectrum and an enemy that even non-Trek fans could appreciate in the Borg.  <br />With Nemesis, there is somewhat of an appeal similar to that in First Contact, but it falls slightly short.  The B4/Data development should have had more time in this movie and the Picard/Shinzon conflict never materialized in a particularly realistic fashion.  Still, Trek fans will appreciate the action sequences towards the beginning of this movie as well as the battle between starships towards the end.  Fans will also appreciate the chemistry between Riker and Troi as they take a big step in their life.<br />I walked out of this movie depressed about the ending and I won't say why but you'll understand when you see the movie.  Overall, I would recommend that Trek fans purchase the DVD for its value as an action flick and the fact that its loaded with tons of extras.  As for me, while I will buy the DVD and I'm really hoping they use the actions scenes from the movie and turn it into something even more fun, a Playstation 2 game.
B000069AUI|5.0|I saw Coldplay live and it was great...the album has the same energy as the live show but is very well produced.  The song structures are original and the vocals amazing.  I highly recommend it.  I personally like it better than their first album.

B00006IU73|3.0|This ranges from heavy metal to accoustic rock and most of it is good. There is no song here that even hints at being prog rock in the ways of thr Flower Kings or earlier Yes. I don't know why they always show up as a prog band, they are not (not this cd anyway). But it is a good cd for other rock sounds.
0446677450|5.0|I found this book to be a very useful guide to becoming financially successful in life. As I am in college, I now know what steps I can take to avoid the &quot;rat race&quot; described by Robert Kiyosaki in this book. I was one of those who thought that working hard and saving would provide me with financial freedom, but now I see just how skewed that perception is. Instead of saving money in a bank, I should be investing it so that my money works for me. I hadn't thought of these things before, but you can bet I am now!
0783226837|5.0|I would be hard pressed to make the case that \\"Tremors\\" is a \\"good\\" movie in the traditional sense; the plot is hokey, the acting is OK, but not great, and the special effects are, again, just OK.  Yet somehow, this is a film that is greater than the sum of its parts.  I can't help but watch it whenever it comes on TV (which is frequently) and in spite of having seen it at least two dozen times, I picked up the DVD the other day.  Ultimately, \\"Tremors\\" is able to succeed because it acknowledges its B-Movie status and revels in it; it doesn't try to be great cinema, it just tries to be fun, and succeeds admirably.    The storyline follows the lives of the few inhabitants of a small desert town as they struggle to survive the onslaught of underground monsters (think slugs with teeth on steroids).  As one might guess, the cast is eccentric to the point of hilarity: there's a cantankerous shop keeper, a hippy artist and her daughter, a 13 year old boy who apparently lives in the middle of the desert with no family or job, and two men who apparently do nothing but sit around all day, one a loser, the other staunchly loyal with an earthy intelligence.  Then there are the main characters Val and Earl, (played admirably by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward), two locals whose ambition is outweighed only by inertia.  In addition, there is the local college student to provide expertise and a love interest, and my personal favorites, a survivalist couple played by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire.  Gross' change from the grown-up flower child on \\"Family Ties\\" to a right wing gun nut is a source of constant amusement, whether it was deliberate or not.    There's no point in rehashing the plot here as it contains the basic elements of any classic horror movie: a small isolated town, overwhelming odds and a struggle to survive.  What sets \\"Tremors\\" apart though is that it doesn't take itself at all seriously; it isn't scary by any stretch, and while there is some tension as to who will survive and how, the outcome is never in doubt.  Instead, every performance is over the top, every B-Movie stereotype is embraced and turned on its head.  The end result is a move that's more funny than entertaining, but that is completely enjoyable.    Finally, the \\"Tremors\\" DVD, unlike many low budget releases, actually has some pretty good extras, including a few deleted scenes, a making of video and the original trailers.  In addition the sound is excellent, much better than I would have expected in fact, and the picture is crisp and clear.    If you're looking for a film with great acting or top notch special effects or serious dramatic issues, or all of the above, \\"Tremors\\" definitely isn't you're choice.  However, if you're looking for a movie that offers some laughs and a few cheap thrills as it entertains you from start to finish, this is a DVD that you'll want to take a look it.      Jake Mohlman
B00005JLSE|5.0|I hate musicals and jazz.  From the first second, I loved Chicago.  When I saw it for a third time, when Gere is doing the razzle-dazzle I screamed \\"this is too much pleasure!\\" in glee!<br />Thank God nobody heard!<br />What a great great movie!

B000089RW0|4.0|Well I first saw this movie in theaters, and I enjoyed it for the most part, and then bought the DVD.  I think this, along with \\"Time Machine,\\" qualifies for some of the most under-rated movies of 2002.  The movie begins with a flashback to the year 1962 to show us how the Antonio Graza became haunted.  The opening scene is filled with a lot of blood and gore, which won't be great for a sqeamish viewer.  We flash-forward to the present day, and the main part of the movie begins.  I think it is a good idea to use the captions on this movie, because you will understand it a lot better.  As the movie goes on, a pretty interesting storyline develops.  The crew finds gold and plan to take it and abandon the ship.  But as they are making their escape, \\"someone or something\\" causes their getaway ship to explode, leaving them stranded on the Antonio Graza.  One of the crew memebers, Santos, dies in the explosion, which breaks the \\"glue\\" that holds the group together, and they go off around the ship on their separate ways.  Murphy, the leader of the group, encounters the ghost of the captain of the Antonio Graza, who warns him that one of the members of the group is plotting to kill them all.  Who that is, I will let you find out in the movie.  But it is fairly predictable.  Before he can tell the other members of the group, however, he is found dead in an aquarium.  An interesting storyline is the relationship of the group's only female, Epps, and the ghost of a young girl named Katie, who was the only survivor of the massacre on the night in 1962.  From the beginning, she has always told them to get off the ship, but of course they never do.  Late in the movie, Katie takes Epps back in time to show her more of what happened in 1962.  What is important here is that the viewer won't find out the entire plot until the last 10-15 minutes of the movie, when the flashback explains everything.  The rest of the crew eventually dies off, each in their own unique way (there is onlyone survivor out of the whole group), and the ship ends up sinking in the end after the remaining crew member sets off explosions in the engine room.  I could never quite understand what happens at the very end of the movie, which is a rather shocking twist that opens the door for a possible sequel (although I don't think there will be one), or it at least gives the viewer something to think about.  The special effects I thought were pretty good.  I really liked the scene where one guy, Greer, is wandering around in the dining hall, and the room transforms to what it was in 1962.  That part was nicely done.  However, at times, the blood looked cheap and the severed body parts looked fake.  Other than the first scene, the movie is mostly PG-13 rather than R, other than some language here and there and very brief nudity.  I strongly recommened the DVD version.  It is packed with tons of features, interviews, and a few riddles to solve as well.  I give this film 4 out of 5 stars.  Nothing too brilliant, but if you're looking for a good horror film to watch on a stormy Saturday night, this is a decent selection.
0743464117|5.0|This book is one super great read! This book covers the never ending training and never ending fighting of Easy Company, 506th Airborne Division in Europe from D-Day to the final capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden.  It was very hard to put down. The action is non-stop.  I forewarn you that you will be \\"glued\\" to this book. I would most definitely buy this book again!
B00003CXXM|4.0|It seems as though this film/DVD has as many detractors as fans. The principal reason seems to be its faithlessness to the decades-old Robert Ludlum novel. Well, I believe Ludlum was an executive producer of the film, and think that he helped migrate the book into a slick script, which provides plenty of screen satisfaction.<br />At last, someone got the idea, that of an amnesiac spy, to the screen, as the first in what was a book trilogy, and will hopefully produce at least one movie sequel. A lukewarm version of \\"Identity\\" played on television years ago (think of the results if it starred Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith!). This version stylishly updates the story to today.<br />I felt that I saw another dimension to talented actor Matt Damon as the action anti-hero of the film, and thought his onscreen chemistry with Franka Potente worked brilliantly. Couple it with a fine performance from Chris Cooper, a jolting assassination, and one of the finest chase sequences I've seen on film....its a winner!<br />The DVD features are somewhat average, although anything filmed this slickly has a lot of interesting background material. The alternate ending was very disappointing.<br />All in all, definitely worth a watch!!!
B00005JLT5|1.0|Simply bad. I like intelligent films and this film is not one of them. It's long, tediously boring and by the end I was not rooting for the survival of the main character. Everyone in the theatre was asleep by the time this film was over.<BR>Stay way, stay far away.<BR>My review may be unpopular but at least it's honest and not driven by Oscar hype.
B00005JKOV|5.0|First of all you have to see this more than once! The first three times I saw this movie I ended up dreaming, it really is not for everyone. So the other night out of no where I popped this into my VCR expecting not to make it through again but wow! This time without trying I compleatly understood it all. I got so excited I have acctually decided to do my own personal project on it.(this is only for my own enrichment). <BR>Honestly I really think most people would not be capable of seeing this flick for what it really is (mindblowing). It is also one of those movies that if you cannot appriciate than your missing the message all together, Waking Life is absoulutly brilliant. I have never been so impressed with the combination of art and music in anything I have ever seen. There are a lot of people that will compleatly dissagree with me on this and I am not sure those are people that I would want for close friends.<BR>I also have a tip for anyone that does see this: don't try to analize every scene, it will make your head hurt. This movie follows each scene in a very peticular order and it really is not as disorganized as it first appears. Also, the art and the music are very much a part of this movie, if you notice when Wiley feels confused the art follows; same for when he has moments of understanding and clarity. it really does all make sense. There is little need for many more words, I'm glad I got a chance to place this review.  Love for all, J.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|this movie started out with such potential for a good story and special effects. then a third of the way into the movie it got bogged down with an utterly stupid plot and died there. what a waste of what could have been a fantastic movie.
6305736650|4.0|Casablanca is a classic, one that I tend to pull out and watch at least once a year.  The only thing that keeps me from five stars is the ending.  Although the story is complete, I always wish for a better end.  The love triangle is devastating from the beginning, but add the danger and desperation of the situation, and it adds to this classic movie.  Everyone should see this at least once.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is Madonna's best album to date!! She has proved, once again, that she can make a brilliant album and keep up with the times. The best part about this album is that she manages to integrate her old sounds and make it sound modern and interesting. As soon as you play Track 2 (Hollywood), you get sucked into this world of Nostalgia and remember the kind of pop music she had released before, but in a whole new way. Love Profusion, Intervention & Mother and Father are just a few other great tracks on this CD. The album has a little bit of every style she has ever used, but she learns to incorporate it in such a way that you the listener are mesmerized by the sound. A MUST BUY!!!
B00006SFBI|5.0|Mobile Fidelity is BACK!  In a big way, wow. . .  I  had forgotten all about this underrated R&amp;B classic featuring &quot;Chef&quot; from South Park, but dear God, this is the real thing, oozing soul and sensuality.  This  is also a two for one treat as it will play on CD players and the new SACD format.<br />I bought it for the CD layer alone and was not disappointed, but when I brought it over to my friend Steve's crib &amp; popped the disc into the SACD player - Isaac Hayes jumped out of the speakers &amp; gave us a freakin' concert!
B00005JL78|1.0|The film begins well, as a lean mean tech-noir machine.  But then it turns into yet another conspiracy thriller, and a more than usually transparent one, at that.  Add a couple of holes in the story that you could push a planet through (Doesn't anyone at the PreCrime Center think of changing their locks?) and the requisite sentimental family affirming stuff, and you have yet another Spielberg film that hasn't the slightest idea of what it really wants to be, and ends up trying to be everything at once, and falls apart in the process.
B00008IXAR|5.0|Mick Hucknall is blessed with an amazing voice, just effortlessly soulful and unaffected. He's also got great taste in material and is an excellent songwriter, as he proves again and again on \\"Home.\\" The first single, \\"Sunrise,\\" is irresistible, as it samples Hall and Oates' \\"I Can't Go For That\\" to create a summery R&B tune, but that song is only the tip of the iceberg. The joyful \\"Fake\\" is explosive and fun, while the sentimental \\"Home\\" is simply lovely. And people who enjoyed Hucknall's cover of \\"If You Don't Me By Now\\" will embrace his impassioned version of \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New.\\" Hucknall and company may be regarded as an '80s act here in the states, but be assured, they're making great modern soul music.
B000068OSK|2.0|I am a huge fan of The White Stripes. I think that Jack and Meg White are fine talented musicians. However, their 1st album isn't that great. THis album has the most songs on it by The White Stripes. That doesn't mean it's all good.<br />There are some fine quality gems on this, however. Jimmy The Exploder is a great opener and my personal favorite. The radical reworking of Stop Breaking Down is also a new classic. And, some of the folk songs like Sugar Never Tasted So Good are also great. And Astro is the finest AC/DC song AC/DC never wrote.<br />However, there's some awful filler in here. Wasting My Time is ruined by Jack's singing. Although he's a good singer, he sounds too overly dramatic on that song. Broken Bricks is too short, Slicker Drips is just too short and pointless, and I was never a fan of Bob Dylan, so One More Cup Of Coffee didn't do anything for me. <br />This is not a good introduction to one of the best new bands out there. Try White Blood Cells first, or De Stijl. This should come last.
B00005JLWN|1.0|I really wanted this to be good - there's nothing I like more than a good Sci Fi movie that challenges the world we live in today, and translates our problems into higher concepts. While the idea of [chemical substance]-induced \\"numbness\\" is an interesting one to explore, it rubbed off on the performances and photography too much. The script is dull and pretentious, and develops as intelligently as Mortal Kombat. \\"Let's get this character from point A to B and then have him fight and move on.\\" This film is dumb, boring, uninspired, pretentious, slow, illogical, too \\"serious\\" and an otherwise complete waste of time. I wish the film's interesting concept had been developed by a less self-important personality with an actual grasp of story and character development.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend watching director Kurt Wimmer's director's commentary on this thing, though ... That ... track makes this DVD worthwhile. ...
B00007JVBI|5.0|This is truly one of the best albums I've heard this year. Although on many tracks the lyrics are indecipherable, it doesn't matter. Chan Marshall's vocals are haunting, and it's the vocals that hold the album together in a singular tone. That tone is mild sadness or a world weariness. This really isn't an album you'd want to hear at a party, but it's something to put on at three in the morning while you're sorting through your old journal writings or old photographs, and wondering how you got to this point in your life, and how you're going to get out of it. Ultimately it feels like there's a certain hopefulness underneath the dreariness, which is what really has kept me listening to it. It's as if there's something more behind the words and the music. By the end, it's more about being released than wallowing. <br />As for the music, it's fairly sparse throughout the album. Lots of piano, some guitar and drums here and there. It fits, though. The sparseness lends to the beauty of the vocals, accenting them.<br />\\"Good Woman,\\" the third song covering the death of a relationship, is probably the best track. \\"Keep on Running\\" is particularly dark and haunting, and the first track, \\"Don't Blame You,\\" seems to clear the air about Cat Power's recent troubles on stage. There are a couple of ravers in \\"Speak For Me,\\" and \\"Free,\\" which sounds like something by Kathleen Hanna, but the rest of the composition is slow and evocative of a certain remiscent or dreamy feeling without high tech effects creating something more atmospheric. This whole album stays very grounded. \\"Evolution,\\" a duet with Eddie Vedder and singular piano, closes things out beautifully.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Polanski proves that being adept at the surreal or fantastical does not preclude a director from composing an effectively thoughtful and linear story. If anything, Polanski demonstrates that true vision knows no bounds. Like many, I wasn't sure how much more of the Nazi regime imagery I could stomach. Quickly I became endeared to the character and found myself pulling for his survival as if it was really taking place. These days it is so difficult to become so absorbed in a film. For a movie to pull this off requires an amazing vision and a successful unfurling of that vision and all its detail. Many forces seemed to work together to achieve this accomplishment.<br /><br />What is so profound about this film is the degree to which the viewer becomes transmogrified through the course of following the central character in his determination to survive.<br />The war scenes and depictions of brutality are, in my opinion, done truthfully and in a manner that lends credence to the story.<br /><br />This movie captures the fundamental human feelings that ultimately pull us all together. It does so without catering to any sense of \\"political correctness.\\" Good and evil are demonstrated by Nazis AND prisoners.<br /><br />More than another \\"war movie,\\" this film transcends genres and moves into the realm of greatness. Whatever you think of Polanski the man, this film is brilliant.

6304712936|5.0|I have to confess that I really, really don't like historical dramas. I usually find them overbearing and tedious. This may sound hypocrite coming from a guy who loves three-hour movies, but when there's nothing engaging in the material, 1.5 hours of dreck can be quite long. <br />Amadeus is not such a movie. It is a historical drama done right. Despite its title, its main character is not Amadeus Mozart, but rather Salieri, contemporary composer and rival who has claimed to have murdered Mozart. The movie is not based on the real facts of the matter (we will probably never know, anyway), but on an interpretation of the facts. Amadeus is historically accurate, as far as it goes, even down to Mozart's annoying laugh, which was described by a contemporary as \\"metal scraping glass\\". <br />Here, Salieri sees Mozart as God's incarnation on Earth - and since God has refused to give him the ultimate talent to sing his praises, and instead gave it to that vulgar iconoclast kid, he will do everything in his power, use all his wiles, to defeat and kill him. <br />It is a story of religious delusion, yes, but clearly also about mediocrity. The mediocre always seek to enslave the successful, be it in politics (suffice it to see the success of social programs and socialization of vital institutions) or otherwise. Salieri suffers : he is good enough to know that Mozart is an absolute genius, but cannot be elevated to his level. <br />For sure, the sets are sumptuous, and the acting right on the note. The accents are distracting, the acting can be slightly overbearing, and the music is overwhelming at times. But there is no point in overaccentuating those : this is a masterpiece, deserving of all the praises it got.
0446677450|5.0|It is interesting when one considers the curriculum and goals of the United States education system. What are our teachers hoping to prepare us for? We memorize hundreds of formulas, dates, and political figures in preparation for what? Obviously to make us more cognizant of the world around us and stimulate our minds is the main goal. But we are never really taught the importance of managing our money when we begin to apply the knowledge we learn. Robert Kiyosaki acknowledges this fact in his very pragmatic, new-age thinking book &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad.&quot; Kiyosaki had a father who made enough money just to support his family while Kiyosaki had a friend with a father who knew how to manage his money. Perhaps Kiyosaki's most perceptive observation is that the poor work for money while the rich have money work for them. It is impossible to get rich simply off a 9-5 job no matter how often you work. Kiyosaki provides his proven secrets to financial security and an early retirement. Everyone should make time to read this book an inherit the wisdom of this man and his lifetime experiences. It will provide one with a valuable perspective of the way money can work for us constantly instead of us living paycheck to paycheck.
6305508550|5.0|Peter is a cubicle worker who goes to see a hypno-therapist with his girlfriend and, as the therapist dies on the spot, is never awakened from his blissfull state. Subsequent events conspire to promote him, and with his two laid-off co-workers, he elaborates a plan to get rich : while uploading files for the Y2K problem, they include a virus-like program that takes rounded-off dimes from bank operations and puts them in their account, thus making them rich. But everything goes wrong, of course.<br />Office Space is definitively a hilariously funny comedy, from which it is difficult to extract boring or flat scenes. It is also a refreshing satire of anti-social views about the workplace, in a movie world where hatred of all things corporate is commonplace (which is to be expected, I suppose, given that no one in Hollywood needs to work in cubicles for a living, so they can badmouth it all they want). This is a very precious movie. Its only main problem is being too short - I was left off wanting more ! But that is, of course, a good thing.
B000089A07|1.0|Awful tripe. Uttererly banal. So I do not at all find it surprising that the majority of the other reviewers on this page like this film, and far more than Hannibal: the latter is more european and thoughtful, the former is pure, empty hollywood. What better contrast between the two than the respective Lecter characters: in Hannibal, a film centered on Lecter, the character is complex, fascinating, and wholly interwoven into the ideation of the film; in Red Dragon, the character is little more than ridiculous, speaking only rip-off lines from Lambs, aping 8-year-old scary-face frights, and looking ludicrous in a horrendous attempt to play someone many, many years younger. <br />This film is perfectly described as a cover of a top 40 hit where the band covers the song note for note, resulting in an empty copy utterly devoid of creative energies. Most everything happens solely because \\"that's how it happened in the original.\\" And when they do try to break from the original, it's ill-conceived and ill-executed. E.g., the depth of character William Petersen creates in Manhunter is utterly absent: but what can Edward Norton do when the film is so cardboard and the script so unmotivated the only non-cliche means he has at his disposal is bad-junior-league-acting in the manner of the exaggerated grasping of the forehead with accompanying gasps of exasperation and moans of inner torment. All the performances were no better than caricatures caught in another a lifeless script.<br />My recommendation: watch Hannibal again and again until you start to understand the difference, and why Lecter would not be caught dead consuming fast-food garbage like Red Dragon.
0953104907|5.0|This is one of the best guitar building books out there. It helps you with many doubts that arise during the process of building a guitar, plus details the construction of 3 major projects: A bolt on guitar, a set neck guitar, and a bass. Following every project step by step, you get coverage of mostly all processes involved in any kind of electric guitar building.<BR>In my own project I had a strong doubt about neck angle, since I was using a TOM bridge, but this book helped me clear all that.<br />Filled with black and white illustrations all along, the book deals with designing a body, cutting it, binding it, building a neck from scratch, gluing or bolting it and dealing with electronics, to finally achieving high gloss finish. There is also a very useful set of templates for pickup routing of guitars and basses. In all, with this book and supported by the guitar maker's forums on the net, I was able to build my first guitar. Check my website for pics of my project.<BR>Peace
0156027321|4.0|I agree with other reviewers about the impossibility to put down this book once you get going. It is a refreshing book on several senses: it renews and reinvigorates the great tradition of sea and castaway stories, but it also refreshes contemporary literature by writing about an incredible accomplishment, instead of the now usual complains of navel-gazing intellectuals.<br />It contains reminiscences of other authors, yet in a new light. I was reminded of Conrad and Melville, but also of Poe -Arthur Gordon Pym- and, of course, Defoe. It could be said that Pi is a Robinson Crusoe confined to an even smaller island and in worse company: his Friday bites. Beyond the great stroytelling skills of Martel, Pi is ultimately a story of pure survival under the most horrible conditions imaginable. It is also a story about the power of faith and the uselessnes of religious confrontations, since all great religions have the same core values and what's important is our personal relationship with the Divine, however you may conceive of it. By the way, I strongly disagree with one reviewer below who recommends skipping the first 100 pages. They are indispensable to understand Pi's attitude towards his predicament, as well as to understand his strategy to cope with the tiger, Richard Parks.<br />Just as any other great adventure book, it goes well beyond the story itself: it has a message, and one that fortunately can be understood at different levels by different readers.<br />Sometimes it resembles a fable, sometimes just a hallucination, but it fits perfectly in the tradition of sea-going adventures which confront Man with total solitude in the face of terrible circumstances, and hence, with Man's faith in God and in himself and the need to extract all his resources just in order to stay alive. A very welcome book that reveals the complete health of literature.
0060523794|4.0|Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? is Gerstner's chronology of and reflections on the years that he ran IBM.  He details the situation that he faced when he left RJR Nabisco for IBM and how he was unsure initially as to whether he could turn the company around.  Gerstner outlines the steps that took and the policies that he put in place to change the strategy and culture of the company.  He notes that when he came, IBM was a company where you were \\"guaranteed\\" a job for life, even while the company was laying people of by the masses.  He also points out that as opposed to competing with their competitors such as Unisys, HP, Dell, Oracle and others, most of managers time was spent in internal political contest.  <br />Through a strategy of listening to customers' needs, eliminating the compensation and recognition systems that created the internal fiefdoms and partnering with customers, quasi-competitors and other industry leaders, he was able to restore IBM to a more stable position within the industry.  He also changed the perception of the company from the conservative black suit, white shirt previously required to be worn by all employees to that of a dynamic company which became synonymous with e-business (a term coined, incidentally, by IBM).<br />As Gerstner says towards the end of the book, his strategy was based on a simple concept, that of an elephant dancing:  While an elephant stands still, ants can scurry around the floor, but if the elephant can dance, all of the ants will be forced from the floor.<br />Will the strategies Gerstner mentions work for others?  Potentially -- Gerstner cautions against simply trying to drop his strategies into other situations.  If nothing else, knowing what worked at IBM (and more importantly what didn't work and how it was fixed) provides additional management tools for us all.  <br />The book, which was written entirely by Gerstner (no ghostwriter, etc.), is remarkably candid.  Gerstner outlines the areas where he feels hesucceeded and those where he failed or which remain a qualified success.  He also highlights the struggles along the way and the way he refined and changed his programs over time.  Gerstner's candidness is really this book's greatest strength and will make it a business-classic in the years to come.

B00008J4P5|4.0|It is about time that a band has really grasped the concept that the best Rock music is simple music. On Elephant, the White Stripes have stripped everything way down to make a real rock record. Seven Nation Army starts off the record well with a simple guitar part that slams. As, the record moves along, the cover of Burt Bacharach's I just don't know what to do with myself  rock's hard with the heavy distortion that is put on there. I was really surprised with Meg's vocals on In the cold, cold night. It was nothing special, but her voice along with the guitar part made it my favorite track on the album. To really make the whole experiance worth while, I recommend buying this great reocrd on vinyl. One record is white, while the other is red. I think that some more records should be made the way that this one was. Forget about the computers and all the polishing that goes on. The best records ever were made that way!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|I swear to god this is the greatest band that ever existed. Lateralus is the expression of the evolution of Tool over it's decade of being together. Maynard comes stronger and heavier vocally than ever on this album. (Ticks &amp; Leeches being an excellent example) Danny gets raw with his crazy patented rolls and claps. Justin really shines on this album, and Adam is more creative then ever.<br />If you don't have this album in your changer right now, get it there!

B000006TRV|5.0|This is truly a rock opera masterpiece.  Waters has reached his apex with this album.  Although, I think a warning is in order here for newer Floyd fans, this is not Dark Side of the Moon; if you are even remotely suicidal, this is not for you.  If exploring the dark side of humanity and emotion is not a problem for you, then I think you will find new nuances in this every time you listen to it and a rewarding musical piece.
6304030983|5.0|In 1989 Disney's THE LITTLE MERMAID initiated a significant renaissance of family films of both the animated and live action variety. There were actually quite a few live action family films produced up through the mid 90s that combined outrageous situations, sentimental plotting and good doses of visual mayhem to entertain most audiences. Some of these films such as HOME ALONE (1990), BEETHOVEN (1992), HOMEWARD BOUND: THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY (1993) and DENNIS THE MENACE (1993) were the staples of this renaissance. By the mid 90s the appeal of such films seemed to be waning. 1995's JUMANJI seemed to be one of the last of the films to gain recognition and prominence at least to the audiences that went to see it. Many of the noted critics at that time were not exactly enthralled with this film. I sat in the theatre thinking that this was one of the most innovative films to come along for some time. It not only contained those elements that characterized the aforementioned family films but also combined convincing digital effects, real drama, danger and concluded with an important message the parents and children should take the time to notice one another and not create impenetrable boundaries around themselves. A boy most grow into manhood before he understands that perhaps his father does not know how to approach him. JUMANJI is filled with action and many special effects that really are elements of the catharsis that Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) must endure before he can ever possibly go home again. Watching this film again recently I was touched by the scene where Robin Williams visits the old family shoe business to find the factory empty and closed down now a home for a transient who barely remembers the fate of Williams' dad. That scene counterbalanced with the score that James Horner had composed of the earlier New England setting was bittersweet. Watching that scene I also drifted back to the time when this film was first released. They really don't make films like this any more. Those were the good old days. And it's really not that long ago. For a while the studios were making intelligent films for the whole family that weren't afraid to make you feel for the characters as well as laugh with them. I have fond memories of JUMANJI.like this any more. Those were the good old days. And it's really not that long ago.

0671027387|5.0|This is one of the fastest read books ever.  I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.

6304696515|5.0|&quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; is, by far, one of the best films ever made! I love everything about this movie from the story to the actors portraying the charcters. I think Glenn Close and John Malkovich were cast perfectly in their roles of scheming, manipulative aristocratic people who have nothing better to do than seek revenge and cruelly ruin people's lives.<br />I would definitely suggest this film to anyone! Younger people may not find this period piece very appealing, so for them I would suggest &quot;Cruel Intentions,&quot; which is based on the same story. Anyone who wants to be immersed in an incredible tale of love, hate, deceit, cruelty, and revenge should watch this film!
B00008H2LE|5.0|I, like many others, found Hybrid Theory to be an awesome album. There wasn't one track I skipped on the whole cd, and Meteora is just the same.  Even the band themselves call Meteora a &quot;Hybrid Theory II&quot; so if you loved the first one, you'll love this one as well!  The downside of the album is the length...however, they explained that instead of having longer songs that may lose the listener's interest, they decided to shorten them.  Each song is very well collaborated and an excellent foreshadowing of what's to be expected of Linkin Park.<br />..excerpt from a recent interview regarding the length..<BR>MIKE: I think that we've always been into succinct songwriting. I mean, we were raised on Sesame Street, and short compact shows. All of these shows have been such a part of our life that we don't have an attention span that's very long, so when you get into a six-minute song, it better be pretty damn good. If you're going to do a six-minute song then it's going to have to some really great stuff in there to hold your attention. What I'm saying, it's not impossible for us to write a longer song, we just always lean towards the shorter stuff, 'cause when we write something that's more toward the four-and-half, five minutes, we usually end up going, &quot;That part's way too long&quot; or &quot;These two things sections can go entirely,&quot; and we shorten and shorten until it's a nice succinct thought that you don't waste any time with, that we don't waste any of the listeners' time with.
B00008HCCF|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD more than any music performances that I've seen in so long.  Norah has so much talent and knowledge of music that it blows me away.  Her shyness seems to really work in her favor as she captures this audience at the House Of Blues.  She still has total control of the band without doing too much, and her music style is incredible and comforting. I highly recommend this DVD.  She makes you feel right at home and the music is so good that you'll want to watch it over and over.  Although she is deemed a jazz/pop artist, she does a great job on Hank Williams &quot;Cold, Cold Heart,&quot; and can sing the blues just as well.  I can't wait to see how far this 23-year old, 8 Grammy Winner takes her music career.  No doubt she'll continue to soar!
B00004YKUY|5.0|... and when I say &quot;welcome back, Journey,&quot; I mean the musicians who had to live with that punk Steve Perry. Yes, Journey was more of an jazz-fusion-rock kind of band prior to SP, making me think of a &quot;Weather Report&quot; for the ROCK stations. Yes, SP brought the Journey boys fame and main stream recognition. But he also brought Journey into a place where &quot;the new guy&quot; took over the band, a band started by very talented musicians who weren't being recognized. Enter Journey-circa-2000, Journey without Steve Perry. yeah, Steve Augeri sounds much like Perry, and yes, much of these new discs have the same commercial potential as with SP, but the music sounds more fresh and both aggressive and soulful, and EVERYONE gets recognized in these songs. I will admit that I think Steve Perry is a punk with lots of talent but not enough to make the world revolve around him; I am glad the band ditched him and moved on. Whether Journey now sells millions of records like they did with Perry, I will be ONE FAN who buys the new ones. And I am not alone...
B00005JLWN|5.0|After seeing Ebert and Roeper's positive reviews, I decided to check it out while all the other lemmings were lined up around the block in the cold to see Lord of the Rings. Most of the people in the theater were only there becuase Two Towers was sold out. When it was over, nobody got up because no one was prepared for what they saw. <br />Matrix-like? Sure. But hey, \\"The Matrix\\" borrows heavily from \\"Ghost in the Shell,\\" \\"The Terminator\\" and The Bible, to name only a few.  Plus, Christain Bale is ten times the actor Keanu is. \\"The Matrix \\"doesn't have Emily Watson, either. <br />This is a slick action flick with great performances and interesting ideas. Why Miramax decided to dump it with minimal marketing is beyond me. Perhaps they have a stake in the upcoming \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" remake and don't want that movie to look redundant. <br />Miramax did the same thing with \\"Below,\\" a great little ghost story that got released in a handful of theaters with hardly any marketing.
B000024D4R|5.0|Beginning and closing with the powerful &quot;Pigs on the Wing&quot;, Animals is one of the best PF albums ever made, the same class where are &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, &quot;Meddle&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and last but not least &quot;The Wall&quot;. &quot;Dogs&quot; is a pure listening experience, beginning with the keyboard/guitar intro, leading to  Waters' powerful vocals. and most significantly the scorching Gilmour guitar solo. &quot;Pigs, 3 Different Ones&quot; continues this same style, to the second best song with &quot;Dogs&quot;, &quot;Sheep&quot;. I can't say much more, you got to hear it. I just love everything in this album, but the solos mostly.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Even if you have no idea who miazaki is, there should be a good chance you'll find something that you love on this magical ride. Personally I liked \\"princess Mononoke\\" and I loved \\"Laputa: castle in the sky\\", but this one, beats them all. Details on the plot have already been discussed elsewhere so I won't go into the story. All I wanna say is the animation is gorgeous, so rich in detail that you can pick up new things each time you see it. The characters are believable and charismatic (even the so-called \\"villain\\") because they aren't devided into good and bad but rather one great big colorful mass of interesting creatures each with their own motives and personality traits. And all these elements come together to form one of the most insanely charming fairytales ever. It feels a bit like Alice in wonderland (the book) and I guess parents should be warned that some scenes are a bit intense, but some truly important and valuable moral lessons are discretely spread around along the way, so I believe that this film is a great and healthy experience that children everywhere should be able to enjoy. If I ever have kids I certainly plan on showing them Spirited away.
B000083E79|5.0|There are many legitimate ways to criticize Cher and her music, but in the end, you'll be happier to succumb to her determined world-weary vocals which have an oddly affecting and convincing emotional consistency  -- nevermind how silly some of these songs are.   She embraces pop music with a wink, and let's us know we're in on the fun -- unlike, say, Madonna who takes herself way too seriously.   Cher knows her limitations, and this becomes her endearing virtue.   She may be a self-made glamorous creation, but she somehow manages to keep it real.  Most of her best singles are here, and it's a blast with some minor exceptions.   I think the remix version of \\"One By One\\" used here is very weak, compared to the original British version, or even the American album release version,   and the exclusion of \\"The Way of Love\\" is glaringly wrong.  Still,  what's here is giddy fist-pumping butt-wiggling pop music at its best.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Only Megadeth can keep other metal bands on thier toes.  Megadeth shows that thier the force of metal music on this album and the best out there.  Clearly the best    because, Dave is the best at what he does and no one can match him. This album is also the best album to date.  The music on this album is incredible, and Daves demons come out and can be felt in every song you here.  You will be left wanting more after hearing this album. NO REGRETS this album is a must to have.  So do yourself a favor and get this album to crave your Heavy Metal lust.  Metal is Forever!!!!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|The cover and inside pictures of Madonna show the onetime Material Girl as the 70's rich girl/SLA brainwashed victim and bank robber. That is my only guess as to why she is pictured with so many guns. <BR>   Now onto the music. This cd keeps on with what she was doing with Music. In that she tries to balance the line between dance/ personal statements and commerical music of now. The only drawback is that she begins most songs with the same beginnings it isn't until she sings that each song takes on its own life. The title track is her look on her celebrity and what makes Madonna  well Madonna. This version includes a four letter word that wasn't necessary to include . The best tracks are \\"Hollywood\\",\\"Mother & Father\\",\\"Easy Ride\\",\\"Love Profusion\\",\\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and the personal \\"Nothing Fails\\". This is a personal collection of songs  from Madonna. The only other weird point is the rap. She has taken a lot from Debbie Harry but not Debbie's rapping skills.
B00005JLEU|5.0|After watching this movie I can see why the disney animators worship the director.  People you respect for their animation abilities (creator of Pixar for example) believe this director to be one of the greatest animators of all times.  Once you see this movie you will understand why.  No computers here.  Painstakingly done by hand, this is a magnificant piece of work.  Younger kids may not truely understand the scope but adults will marvel at the creativity and the workmanship.  You know the story, you know about the awards, now watch the movie.
B00007J5VN|3.0|This is a favourite movie of mine. Considering the talent in the movie it has taken a remarkably long time to come onto DVD. Seeing the movie in widescreen again after 23 years was a thrill. The pictore on my 10' 'scope screen was bright clear and colourful. The sound quality was supurb.<br />The only dissapointment for me was the lack of surround sound. The cover stated it was a 4.0 mix but listening to the rear channels you would not know it. In the production numbers such as The Rhythm of Life there were a large cast and lots of movement on screen yet during these numbers the surround channels stayed woefully silent.<br />A marvellous release but with that one sour note.
0792110188|5.0|El Dorado is the somewhat clichéd story of John Wayne playing the out of work gunslinger and picking up a drifter who can't shoot well. They head to a town run by criminals taking advantage of a drunken sheriff, who himself was a friend the John Wayne character. Add in gun play and some romance, and you'd normally have a cookie cutter film that makes everyone some money.<br />However, this is the most entertaining western film I have seen. The natural dialogues that the characters partake in, the give and take, is very funny. The story is simple enough to understand, but not too simple to be childish. <br />When asked what the best western ever made was, I wouldn't mention this movie, but if I was asked what film I would most want to watch, El Dorado comes to the top of the list.
0385507755|4.0|Reading this book I can't help but be reminded of all the parallels between literature and music. Frey has rhythm. And melodies. And poignant silence.<BR>The first thing I heard about this book was a quip regarding Dave Eggers, and how James Frey could write circles around him. I was intrigued, first because I found Eggers so totally pretentious that I couldn't get past page 5 of A Heartbreaking Work.., and second because I was thrilled that someone else didn't subscribe to the dominant trend of Eggers glorification.<BR>This is a story about addiction and recovery, and a man who has the good fortune to receive the best treatment the country has to offer. Lucky for us, he has enough brains to challenge the system and think for himself, not blindly accepting the prescribed path. It's about breaking out of our hard shells, whether they've been formed by addictions or hate or what have you.
0671027387|5.0|Hey, if I want the classics, I'll read Hemingway or Melville.<br />A quick read, an interesting plot and sub-plot<br />both nicely woven together. Great scientific explanations about<br />the ocean and...well I don't want to give too much away.<br />Yeah, yeah, everyone will complain that political cover-ups and hidden gov't research are old hat, but this guy finds a few new twists and spins the tale so fast you can't believe it's five hundred pages...and it takes place in ONE DAY!<br />Just take it to the beach...hmmmm, come to think of it, may you should stay away from the water on this one: take it on a plane instead.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is possibly the finest production ever produced.  The acting is superb. The actors make you believe that they are indeed the real men -- they are THAT good. It will hold your interest throughout and will make you want more when you finish all 10 hours.  The special effects are awesome and the story is incredible --all the more so as it is TRUE !!!  Every American should see this miniseries and everyone owes a great debt to Tom Hanks, Steven Speilberg, HBO, and  all the great actors and especially to the REAL men of E company !!!!!!  BRAVO !!!
0312263120|5.0|C'mon people, this was a great read! Yeah, I figured out the<BR>ending a few pages before the characters (each chapter is only a page or two, sometimes less), but so what? <br />Anyway, that plot point is just one of may twists and turns. Obviously this author worked out his plot backwards and it's seamless.<br />Let's stop being so picky about an author who doesn't dumb down his plots just to appeal to mass-market morons.<br />Read it and learn something. All the \\"experts\\" below claiming he didn't do his research: I write computer software and while he took some shortcuts, he basically got it right.<br />Sheesh! Finally some fast-paced intelligence and he gets shot down by everyone!<br />For the record, I find Tom Clancey extremely boring and his books are way too long. Except for \\"Red October\\" I've never found a single book of his even remotely suspenseful. (I don't even care that I don't know how to spell his name.)
B000002KIE|4.0|It's the Sex Pistols, what more can you ask for?  My friends make fun of me because I own this album (my girlfriend got it for me), but I tell them to listen to songs on it with an open mind.  They're much better than the Ramones, at least in my opinion.<br />Oh, and if anyone starts saying \\"oh, but the Ramones were the first punk band,\\" ever heard of IGGY AND THE STOOGES or the MC5?  Ziing!
0800141806|4.0|THis is great movie and I loved it.It removes the apprehension and hat we have for homosexuals and people who suffer from AIDS.The movie is not just about lawsuits and prejudice but also about human acceptence.Gays are just like us but only have different hormonal instincts.If we can forgive everyone who are not gay for their human weakness why not accept gays as they are.Great acting by Tom hanks but the spotlight is Denzel as well who is equally great in acting.Hats off to both of them ...Great actors
6300182282|4.0|If you've ever found your soul mate, and for whatever reason couldn't be with them, you need to see this movie.  It's about two people who meet by chance (as soul mates do), but they are both happily married - to other people.  George and Doris love their spouses and don't want to leave, yet they have found a soul connection in each other that they can explain nor deny.  So they meet at the same place, on the same weekend every year.  They each assist the other in dealing with obstacles in their lives and they work through the guilt and limits of their relationship. No matter how each of their lives change (mostly Doris') and how different their lives are, they still love each other for who they are.  In the beginning it can seem kind of cheesy and the characters can be a little annoying, but throughout the movie you will seem them grow to their full potential.
B00008973A|5.0|Ignore the negativity above. The Marvin Hamlisch songs, Ralph Burns orchestrations, cast performances, underscore, even the early 1980's vintage synthesizers used occasionally etc. are stunning going on 20 years later. It was definitely time to replace the old worn out VHS tape with the DVD. Well worth the price. Nice interview with Marvin Hamlisch at the end.

630027179X|5.0|Excalibur is the definitive Aurthurian film. Everything in this film is first rate. The scenery was grand. The castles and battlefields made it all seem real. The staging of the battle scenes was impressive. The fighting was convincing, like these battles were really taking place. They were, if anything, too bloody.<br />The acting was excellent too. Nicol Williamson did a great job of portraying Merlin. Merlin came across as wise, intimidating and stern, but caring. Nicholas Clay and Liam Neeson gave fine performances as the great knights Lancelot and Gawain. Nigel Terry managed his role of Arthur, but not as well as the others.<br />The soundtrack was magnificent. Boorman chose the right music for the right scenes. This music conveyed the varied moods of this film-mystery, excitement, sorrow, and exultation.<br />These elements come together amidst an epic tale- A story of Rise, fall, and redemption; trust, betrayal, and revenge. This film is good enough to watch many times. Even when one becomes familiar with this version of the Arthurian legend, it is still worth watching for its' looks, sounds, and performances. It can stir the emotions of viewers even when they know exactly what to expect.

0688163173|3.0|Mr. Lehane has chosen an interesting topic: insanity and cruel methods of treating it. Unfortunately, the story is flat and uninspired. The ending is supposed to be a big surprise, but,at least for me, the ending is a dud. I do not want to give away the plot, but one of the climactic scenes is ruined when the hero fails to kill his nemesis ( Dr. Cawley)when he could have simply hit him with his gun, even after it failed to shoot the doctor. I felt there was a lot of surface cleverness; I think Lehane wanted to create a Thomas Cook \\"deep\\" story, but he simply doesn't bring it off. Same thing happened with Mystic River, a totally overrated novel. Also, lithium is improperly described and manic-depressive disorder is equated with psycosis; a very few manic-depressives may be psycotic, but it is not normal.  Finally, the main dr. wants talk therapy to prevail over surgery and drugs.  This makes no sense since with severely mentally ill patients (like the ones on Shutter island) talk therapy is useless. A very disappointing book.
B000002TLX|3.0|Best known for such MOR classics as Right Here Waiting and Hazard, Richard Marx's career has followed a rather boring, predictable path. His nondescript brand of contrived soft rock cries desperately for an injection of spontaneity to breathe life into what is going on. Sonically, the sound may flatter your system, but it does nothing for the music's energy. Tracks like the melodramatic Hold On To The Nights may have promise were their production not so overdone and manufactured. Each and every sound seems meticulously planned and impeccably executed. Accordingly, songs are robbed of any sort of impulsiveness or naturalness, and instead are overbearingly pristine and polished. Fake, even.<br />There are moments of likeability, however. Endless Summer Nights benefits from a catchy melody and neat structure; Angelia has a wonderful guitar-heavy sound and big chorus. And Right Here Waiting still hits the spot, managing to sound subdued and urgent at the same time. His voice weaves the simple melody with great yearning, and when Marx reveals the extent of his covetousness (\\"Oh, can't you see it baby/You've got me going crazy\\") he is at his most sincere yet. Equally, Hazard remains charmingly poetic. But there's no getting past the prevailing nature of this collection. It offers passable listenability, but little more.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Godsmack is pretty strange, first they come out with a good album, and then comes Awake with a very dull (but still enjoyable) sound. And now here is Faceless, which is a very nice album again. The songs are a lot more melodic than the ones on Awake, there are better riffs, better solos and Sully has improved his singing skills a lot, just like his songwriting. Here are the tracks:<br />1.) Straight Out Of Line: typical Godsmack song, not outstanding, but much better than the overhyped \\"Greed\\" (7/10)<br />2.) Faceless: I thought the title track will be a longer one, and this is only 3:33 mins long, but it is a damn cool song with a fantastic chorus (9/10)<br />3.) Changes: the chorus is very catchy, the rest of the song is not that good, but it still makes up for a really nice song (8/10)<br />4.) Make Me Believe: not a very good song, but the slow, melodic part in the middle saves it (7/10)<br />5.) I Stand Alone: we all know this song is great - from the Scorpion King soundtrack (8/10)<br />6.) Re-Align: sounds a bit like Keep Away, but it is a lot better one, and one of the best songs on the album (8/10)<br />7.) I F*cking Hate You: I did not enjoy this song as much as the rest, it is not too deep lyrically (wow, who would think after a title like this :-)...) (6/10)<br />8.) Releasing The Demons: a good one again, very good lyrics (7/10)<br />9.) Dead And Broken: this is the weakest song on the album, but still a lot better than numerous songs on Awake (6/10)<br />10.)I Am: many people like it, and it is not a bad one really, but did not catch into my ears as e.g. \\"Re-Align\\" or \\"Changes\\" did (7/10)<br />11 + 12.) The Awakening + Serenity: these two fit together perfectly and make a very good song, I think Serenity is the song that finally beats \\"Voodoo\\" (8/10)
B00002E233|1.0|This is absolutely the worst movie ever made. I knew it was going to be bad when I first started watching it, but then they killed Samuel L. not even half way through the movie. That, and LL Cool J is in it make this not-scary-at-all movie the worst EVER.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|This CD is definitely good enough to warrant spending the cash.<BR>It's not the greatest CD ever made, though, and doesn't really<BR>deserve a 5 star rating.  Their first CD had two tracks (2 &amp; 3)<BR>that have yet to be matched.  However, this is definitely one of<BR>the best metal offerings of the year.  If you own any Godsmack<BR>albums without owning Metallica's _Master of Puppets_,<BR>_...And Justice For All_, or Megadeth's _Rust in Peace_, you<BR>should definitely go with those first.  They are classics.<BR>This is just a good album.
B00006L83N|4.0|This is the first progressive metal CD I've ever purchased (unless you consider Opeth progressive Metal). Anyway, I can see what all the hype is about in some ways. This record is filled with ultra-fast guitar work (solo's and riffs), keyboard melodies, classical violins, and melodic vocals. All of which, on this record anyway, work seemlessly well together on every track. This is most evident on the final 24 minute track \\"The Oddessy\\", which is split into 8 different parts but are blended together ingeniously. The whole thing is like a story, told by the singer through his lyrics and some parts break into instrumentals packed with more violin's, flutes, keyboard work, and guitar thrashes which almost take you away into this story. The first 3 tracks sound something like a melodic Ozzy Osbourne but when the 4th track \\"Accolades II\\" comes on, the classical elements introduce themselves brilliantly. I enjoyed this record a lot, I didn't love it, hence the 1 star taken off.<br />So why 4 stars? Well, even though all the songs aren't too long or too short, most falling into the 5-8 minute range, I still felt bored with a few of them, not at first, but I became bored after about 3 listens. The first 3 tracks for example are good in terms of instrument work, everything is fast and played flawlessly, but especially on the 2nd and 3rd track you feel you've heard it all after the 2nd chorus. It's almost like you have to be in the right mood to listen to this, it's not really just-a-pop-in-and-enjoy type of record. Either that or I'm just in a stale mood today but whatever. Track 4 is w/o a doubt the best on the album, even though I still felt they could've done more with the chorus and edited the mid guitar solo's a bit. Tracks 5,6 go back to the formula of the first 3 tracks- less classical, more melodic power metal, but are better songs.I take that back, track 6 is good, track 5 is a little boring. Track 7 is an 8 minute softer ballad with a great use of piano and symphonies, which becomes heavy and incorporates some really great classical music within, This song is awesome! Track 8 is a great ending like I said before with the 24 minute storyteller. <BR>In conclusion, the only thing I can say about this is that it's a great prog metal album, incorporating great classical influences. Give this one a few listens, then stick it on the shelf and return back to it about a month later, just don't play it out because this album tends to do that easily.
0345451325|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a very big fan of Halo-it's one of my favorite games.  Don't get me wrong again-I really did admire the game's interesting story (which, if I'm not mistaken is retold in Halo: The Flood).  The Fall of Reach is a prequel to the game, which tells the story before Halo.  It answers questions like, where did Master Chief, Cortana, and Captain Keyes come from, what is the deal with the Covenant, why was Master Chief in the &quot;Hushed Casket&quot; at the beginning of Halo the game.  This takes everything ritious about the game and waters it down.  It is interesting at some parts, but to give Master Chief a name is dumb unless it provides some kind of vital importance to the plot.  I really didn't care what he did as a kid, I want to know more about the Spartans.  I was really wondering, how in the world are they going to arrive at the beginning of the game.  When they did, I was so disappointed.  There are some good parts of the book.  I kind of liked the character of Ensign Lowell too.  I'm sure there's some enjoyment sci-fi readers will find, which is why I'm giving this a 2 instead of 1.  But, oh man...the potential...how great this book could have been.
0062502182|5.0|This is an extraordinary story about optimism, hope, courage and perseverance. It is about finding out what is our 'mission' in life, about destiny and following our dreams - whenever one wishes something, the whole universe conspires to its realisation. Everything is possible as long as we really want this to happen.<br />At the first level, the story seems to be very simple, and as Coelho himself said it, &quot;simple things are the most valuable and only wise people appreciate them&quot;. But it is by far a very complex story with very deep meanings.<br />One of the things suggested here is that people who don't dare to follow their dreams, their 'Personal Myth', will have a superficial and empty life.<br />It is also about being courageous to meet your destiny, to dare making your dreams come true and following the road that has been made for them, and find God while searching for their destiny and their mission on earth.<br />Another important issue in this book is finding your soul-mate and love - the core of existence and creation. When we are in love we try to improve ourselves: &quot;I love you because the whole universe conspired for me to come close to you.&quot;<br />I think this book can be enjoyed by everybody, because we all find ourselves in Santiago, the main character of the book - we all have dreams, desires and perhaps some us dont have the necessary courage to follow our dreams - and courage is the language that helps you most in understanding the world.<br />I recommend this book to everybody who thinks that life is still beautiful and even to those who believe the opposite - Im sure it will make you change your minds.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I normally have to write alot to express how i think an abum has done but in this case one word somes up the whole album ''AMAZING''. This was my third ever album and it is one of my most listenned to albums. This is Limp Bizkit at their best and most creative, with Wes Borland experimenting with different sounds for the music such as no sex and Nookie, Fred rapping with the guy from wu'tang clang Method man, and John Davis even does a guest appearance. All Limp Bizkits different styles at their best are all gathered together on this album. If your a Nu-metal fan don't listen to the critics this is a must have it stands out as one of the best cd's in my cd rack!<br />BUY IT!!!!
B00006JLX4|5.0|I don't care how helpful this review is: Summer Babe is the best indie song. Ever. The rest of the tracks are masterful and quite eclectic.
B00000IACG|2.0|I just find it hard to get into a CD that is primarily a bunch of unreleased demos and live tracks. Unlike other bands like Pavement, Fugazi's best songs always made it onto the albums. There are no gems here, just raw versions of songs that sound much better in their final incarnations. You are much better off getting all of the other studio releases first. If that is not enough Fugazi for you, buy the video and watch that. If you really like it, then come back and buy this. You will probably really enjoy it. This should be the absolute last thing in the Fugazi catalog you buy.

B00005JLZ9|5.0|While this film is being marketed as a pretty standard 'war/basic training' movie, it's anything but -- more like a really good \\"Law & Order\\" episode meets \\"Jag\\". We stumbled into it when it was the only thing left at the multiplex, and were very pleasantly surprised by the performances and a script with several twists and turns you really can't outwit. A handful of marines have been murdered on a training exercise, and the suspects and motives are multiple. A smart, sexy, interesting film.
0316096199|3.0|One thing in common with the Lovely Bones is the fact that Sebold has an extremely effective and powerful style of grabbing the reader in the first chapter.  Even though I knew what each book was about, I found both Lucky and Lovely Bones riviting in their first chapters.  However, unlike Lovely Bones, I found myself skimming pages in Lucky to get to the essence of the story.  I gave it 3 stars and was contemplating 4 because I was not only compelled to finish it, but found that it stayed with me enough to discuss it with friends.  (one friend also agreed with the skimming technique to try to finish).  The book is important because Lovely Bones would probably not have been written but for Sebold getting out this story, which is in itself a very powerful story of survival.   Something to talk about. . .

0790729725|5.0|But I can't stand how this is 2 sided dvd.  I thought it was Widescreen and Fullscreen, but yet it was side A and side B.  The viedo only had 1 casset, and this just pissed me off.  Getting that aside, this is one of the greatest mob movies ever made.  It explains how a kid hung arounnd a cabstand, and grew up to become a made gangster.  Ray Liotta(Henry Hill) did a real good job in the movie as the man, and a good job as the narrirator, Robet Deniro(Jimmy) delivers one of his greatest acts in his carrer as a man who did mob hits since he was 16.  And Joe Pessi(Tommy Diveto) deserved best supporting oscar for his role as a low temperd man who wouldn't take no ....  This movie shows three decades of the mafia, than began the good times, but ended in bad times.  This movie will keep your eyes glues to the screen to the very end.  Trust me, if you loved the godfather, there's no doubt in my mind you'll love this.  But don't buy the DVD like I did.  Avoid that mistake, and get the video.

B00008J4P5|4.0|A mixed bag but with the good outweighing the bad by a fair bit. The production, as you'd expect, is a pretty slapdash amd Megs drumming gets wayward here and there but (I'm led to believe) this is part of the charm.<br />It's not much of a step forwards (four albums in and not a lot of change) but if you like it (which I do) then it's good stuff. 'Seven Nation Army' and 'The Hardest Button to Button' are a couple of the best tracks they've done ever, nevermind highlights of the album.<br />If you liked 'White Blood Cells' get this because it's better. If you didn't then leave well alone because it's not a whole lot different.
B000063V8R|5.0|Season 3 of TNG was the best Season of ANY Trek spinoff...ever.  Character development was matched by unpredictable plots and some damn fine acting.  By far, the best moment was when the pale-faced Picard/Locutus addressed acting-Captain Riker with the words, &quot;Resistance is Futile&quot;.<BR>  However, look at episodes: &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;, &quot;The Child&quot;, &quot;Tin Man&quot;, &quot;Sarek&quot;, and the career making episode for Wesley Crusher, &quot;Menage a Troi&quot;... these are the best episodes of the season and the through-lines of the season is an admirable accomplishment.
B000006NUW|5.0|The years 1959 - 1971, when Motown was located in Detroit, is considered the golden era of the label.  Motown charted over 350 singles during this time and it would probably take at least 10 cds to do this period justice.  This collection, Motown's most extensive at the time of its release in 1992, is comprised of four cds.  Of the 104 singles included here, only two didn't chart: Syreeta's \\"I Can't Give Back The Love I Feel For You\\" and Shorty Long's original version of \\"Devil With The Blue Dress On.\\"  The inclusion of Carolyn Crawford's rare and gorgeous \\"My Smile Is Just A Frown (Turned Upside Down)\\" was worth the cost of the set alone for the serious Motown collector.  It and the Syreeta single were appearing on cd for the first time (both have been included on other Motown compilations since then).<br />Motown went for a wide variety of artists (36) instead of just choosing the obvious hits by the major artists as previous collections had done.  Of the major artists, the nine selections each by the Miracles and the Temptations are a good representation of their best work during this period.  The Diana Ross-led Supremes, however, are strongly neglected, with only four singles included here.  Especially key omissions in a historical set such as this is their first and last number ones: \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\" and \\"Someday We'll Be Together.\\"  Meanwhile, all three 1970-1971 hits by the Jean Terrell-led Supremes are found here. The selection of Martha and the Vandellas' \\"Love (Makes Me Do Foolish Things)\\" over \\"I'm Ready For Love\\" and \\"Honey Chile\\" doesn't work for me, while Shorty Long's only bonafide hit, the novelty \\"Here Comes The Judge\\" is left off at the expense of the non-hit \\"Function At The Junction\\" and \\"Devil With The Blue Dress On.\\"<br />These digitally remastered singles are all in crisp mono, as they were originally mixed for radio.  Many of them (such as the Supremes' \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" and the Temptations' \\"Cloud Nine\\" are dramatically differentfrom the versions heard on \\"oldies\\" radio today.  The singles are sequenced for the most part in release date order.  Most of the major hits from the 1959 - 1963 period are included on the set: Barrett Strong's \\"Money,\\" the Miracles' \\"Shop Around\\", the Marvelettes' \\"Please Mr. Postman, and the Contours' \\"Do You Love Me\\", for instance.  In 1964, Motown became a true hit factory (the Supremes, Temptations, and Four Tops all had their first major hits that year) and it is here that the omissions on the set start to become more pronounced.  There is just too much great music from 1964 through 1971 from Motown to fit onto only four discs (actually three, since the first disc is dedicated to the 1959 - 1963 period).  <br />The 68-page booklet is a nice accompaniment to the discs.  While the biographies aren't that extensive, it is hard to find even what is listed here on the more obscure artists like Carolyn Crawford and the Monitors.  A thorough track listing provides the artist's name, songwriters, publishers, producers, release date, label number, and peak chart position in Billboard (pop and r&b) for each single.  Best of all is the listing - by instrument and year - of the names of the incredible musicians who played on the Motown recordings.  Motown never put musician credits on any of the albums it released during this period and it is great to see them finally given their due on a major collection.<br />Motown subsequently released a four-disc box set companion collection (in stereo) covering 1972 - 1992.  It is a shame that they never released an additional box set (or two) on the 1959 - 1971 period.  This retrospective is a great introduction to the magic of Motown, but it is far from the complete story.
B00008972S|5.0|West Side Story is one of the greatest films ever made. This may sound like an opinion, but the American Film Institute has named it one of the top 100 hundred films ever. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave it a well-deserved 10 Academy Awards in 1961. Those two bodies are who determine if a film is truely great. Enought said.<BR>This film although was made in 1961, it doesn't appear old at all because it is timeless, and it's story can happen anytime.<BR>Set in the 1950's in New York, West Side Story is a modern day(at least when it was concieved) Romeo and Juliet. Two kids from rival gangs fall in love, and because of the other gangs feelings for each other, their lives then fall apart. Natalie Wood plays Maria, and Richard Beymer plays Tony. Russ Tamblyn plays Riff, George Chakiris plays Bernado, and Rita Moreno plays Anita. Berando is the leader of a gand called the sharks, who are from Puerto Rico. Riff is the leader of the Jets, from New York, the native New Yorkers. <BR>This film can get deep with underlying messages, but I wont discuss that because what makes West Side Story so great is its music. Those wonderful songs, and great Score(Leonard Bernstein). It's great for the Family, nothing to hide from. <BR>My Favorite role in the Musical is Anita, by Rita Moreno. She is just so spunky and full of energy. Rita Moreno won one of the 10 oscars, and George Chakiris did too.<BR>This edition comes with a wonderful scrap book, with a complete screen play for West Side Story, so now you can get those lyrics that you are a little unsure about. <BR>This is a keeper and one that you need to add to your collection. Don't be someone who hasn't seen it, because once you see it, you never forget it.
B00008977N|4.0|True, there is some grain to be seen on this DVD, being that it was shot on film in 1993, mostly in low light. It looks a lot like the first half of U2's \\"Rattle and Hum,\\" but not quite that grainy. There are some moments on the DVD when the grain can't be seen; even when it can, it isn't that big of a distraction, at least on my 37-inch TV. Gabriel and his band are nothing short of amazing. Their sound is tight, energetic and moving, for lack of better descriptives. Some have complained that the sound and video don't always link together - I only counted a couple times where it is obvious, when Tony Levin takes his right hand away from his bass on \\"Sledgehammer\\" although his playing still is heard. (They did film/tape two nights at the same venue in Italy, I think.) But hey, let's face it, almost every concert film has had some post-gig doctoring - Levon Helm has gone on the record saying his drumming is about the only thing live on the Band's \\"The Last Waltz\\" becaues he refused to overdub his drum parts. \\"Secret World Live\\" is one of the greatest concert films ever, period. This version of \\"Solisbury Hill\\" could be the greatest incarnation of Gabriel's declaration of independence from his former band, Genesis. The sight of him trapped inside a red phone booth on the opener, the then-new \\"Come Talk To Me,\\" is great music theater without ever being campy or overblown. Gabriel is a true master of the stage - he spends about 97 percent of his time in motion. The DVD is well worth its affordable price, even though the picture isn't immaculate like some think it should be. Actually, the grain adds atmosphere and character to the film, at least on smaller to mid-sized TVs.

B00000DQSF|5.0|When The Band released their debut &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; like an angry pitbull free from its leash, Rolling Stone raved that the album was &quot;an event&quot; as opposed to a rock and roll record. They couldn't have been more right. Bob Dylan's former back-up band, consisting of four Canadian bar-room musicians and an Arkansas farm boy, had completed one of rock's most pure and perfect works, an example of what countless artists have strived to immitate since 1968.<br />&quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; wasn't only an event, but a rebellion. The Band was one of the two groups that made such an impact musically by going against the grain of burgeoning psychedelic space rock of the late '60s (the other being Creedence Clearwater Revival). The work within is nothing short of a masterpiece; mysterious, soulful, often gritty and heartwrenching. Blossoming Canadian songwriter Robbie Robertson's flawless portrait of Americana is more vivid than most musical portraits painted by American artists. Songs like 'To Kingdom Come,' 'Caledonia Mission,' and a cover of Dylan's 'I Shall Be Released' seem to come straight from within the grooves of 19th Century American life. The harrowing opener 'Tears of Rage' (penned by Band-member Richard Manuel and Bob Dylan) is one of the outfit's most heartwrenching tunes, while songs like 'Chest Fever' and 'The Weight' are quintessential Band. The musicianship on this album is superb, needless to say, displaying talent in the voices of Manuel, Levon Helm, and Rick Danko, while Garth Hudson's keyboards are flawless.<br />Perhaps the only problem with &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; was, along with their self-titled sophomore album, it would become so respected it would all too often cause later worthy efforts like &quot;Stage Fright&quot; or &quot;Cahoots&quot; to pale in comparison, according to many critics. Nonetheless, &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; is an all-out masterpiece, something that will always be identified as one of the prime musical events of its time.me musical events of its time.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The movie is witty, naughty, funny, colorful and I totally loved it!<BR>The cast and crew made this '20 atmosphere and all the actors made unbeleivably marvelous job, just brilliant, I must say.<BR>I always loved musicals (so good to see them coming back !), and Chicago is right there with \\"Singing in the rain\\" and \\"Some like it hot\\" on my list.<BR>I already bought the soundtrack and catching myself singing those beautiful, funny songs all the time .<BR>So the movie is wholeheartedly recommended by me.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I am not sure where to start with this review, but I should begin by saying that I am a huge Madonna fan and have been since I was a mere child dancing to Material Girl in my living room. I have literally fallen head over heels both times with her last two albums, RAY OF LIGHT and MUSIC....however, I haven't felt even the slightest tingle of joy or love for this new album. Madonna seems to once again take on the Mirwais styled sound stylings that are getting a little old now and the beats seem to get a little repetitive and lack the usual catchy quality that her songs have seemed to have in her last albums. Some of the songs confuse me and others leave me feeling weirded out by Madonna's strange lyrical content. I gave the cd 2 stars instead of just 1 because I feel that Madonna stuck by what she believed in and made an album that was personal and liberating and I give her credit for that. I love Madonna with a firey passion but this album will not be getting much play from me unfortunatly. Hopefully, her next one will be a little better and have more catchy hooks and better lyrics to the songs. I have to stay true and be honest about this cd...I'm sorry guys, I am just not that big of a fan of it!! :(
0812550706|5.0|This book was a great read for me, my friends will like it two.  This book is NOT FOR EVERYBODY.  But the ones who like it really will.  This book as low AND high points.  This being my first minutes after completing the book I feel as if a piece of me as gone...  I have net yet determined if this has a sequil etc. but verymuch look forward to reading them if they exist.
B00004TKAQ|5.0|One of the greatest records of the sixties and one of my favorites. The guitar playing is simply phenomenal! But it is also a psychedelic album, taking you on a &quot;trip&quot; that winds down at the end of &quot;Calvary&quot;, sort of like someone walking off into the sunset, then the somewhat ironic &quot;Happy Trails&quot; last. What a nice trip, now bye! Also the last we would hear of the great sounds of the original quartet on the first 2 albums.<br />I think this Repertoire release sounds a little better than the previous Capitol release, but not much. It's still worth getting, though. Repertoire has released some really good sounding CD's recently, especially the Yardbirds albums, so you can trust that the sound will be good. The booklet has the usual information about the band's career, i.e., the first album didn't capture how they sounded live, the 2nd live one was great, the third not so great, they had a semi-hit with Fresh Air, etc. Not really a whole lot of new revealing information if you already are familiar with QMS. I would like to have found more specific information about the recording of &quot;Happy Trails&quot; and what the band was up to at that time. Oh well, it was a long time ago...
B000002AH7|5.0|but I kinda like the music!  Sorry, I couldn't resist.  That pale attempt at humor aside, I just wanted to add my two cents to the discussion of this amazing work.  To my ears, it doesn't matter if you consider this classical, jazz, or country-thrash- death-polka, the music is amazing.  Any song that can move you to tears upon listen after listen like \\"Concierto De Aranjuez\\" has got to be special.  Gil Evan's arrangements flow without saying; if there's a house band in heaven, he's the one arranging the tunes.  I don't know if I have ever heard a flugelhorn sing with such passion as on this recording.  This CD is much cheaper than a plane ticket to Madrid, so if you're unsure as to whether or not to buy it, the captain has turned off the seat belt sign, and you may now click your mouse to buy it!!
B00006RYIQ|5.0|No Other is one of those sadly classic albums that have become lost & warrant rediscovery- thus it ranks a place among releases such as Third/Sister Lovers, Pacific Ocean Blue, Don't Stand Me Down, Dust & Beyond the Sun. This Collector's Choice Music edition is most welcome, as No Other has been deleted for sometime (like LPs such as Star Sailor & Time Fades Away). Three of the tracks- Silver Raven, True One & Lady of the North were on the brilliant Flying High-compilation of Clark's work- but the album has to be heard in its entirety to be appreciated (the sleevnotes reveal Clark's original plan to make a 13-track double album- if only! Though sometimes less is more, something that Steve Stills should have learned on Manassas). <br />Life's Greatest Fool is a great opening track, advancing on the material of 1971's White Light (which had featured With Tomorrow & Dylan's fave Spanish Guitar)- the soulful backing vocals recall such classic 70s albums as Exile on Main Street & Greetings from LA. Silver Raven is dark acoustic wonder- perfectly pitched prior to the imaginative title track (which sounds like the best song Gram Parsons never wrote, with musical reference points such as In a Silent Way & There's a Riot Goin On). <br />The centre of the album is Strength of Strings- a song I was only familiar with from the cover on This Mortal Coil's Filigree&Shadow. This is a mindblowing song that still leaves this listener reeling- imagine prime Love meets 461 Ocean Boulevard meets Michael Nesmith's Different Drum meets James Taylor's Fire&Rain and with the same degree of invention common to few- such as Tim Buckley and you're close...but really, such a great song can't be put into words. <br />The rest of the album is as great- From a Silver Phial looking at the bleak side of the 60s dream & featuring ex-Byrd/Burrito Chris Hillman on mandolin; while Some Misunderstanding is an eight-minute joy- Clark railing at the meaning of life in the same manner that Van Morrison didon TB Sheets&Astral Weeks. <br />The final two songs sumarise the album- The True One as great as anything off Return of the Grievous Angel, Clark sounding at peace with existence (despite the fact that No Other would flop & put his career in nosedive till his death in 1991- a few years later the NME would revere No Other as a lost classic...). Final track Lady of the North (co-written with Doug Dillard) is an absolute joy- sounding cinematic, like Scott Walker playing with the Burrito's- Clark's gorgeous folk-soul vocals literally melting around the sublime strings: a perfect end to a perfect album. <br />Hopefully, in time, Gene Clark will become more appreciated- to these ears No Other should be up there in the endless myriad of Best Albums Lists we have been assaulted with since 1999. An album that deserves to be up there with the all-time greats: Blood on the Tracks, Astral Weeks, Pet Sounds, Sulk, Loveless, Dust etc. The cult of Clark should grow, it's not like you can produce music this wonderful and no one will listen, is it?
0192833588|3.0|This novel was the first one written by this particular author and, as such, shows the talent that she possessed of telling rich tales full of in-depth descriptions of her characters.  Reading this novel was not a totally enjoyable experience for me, probably due to the fact that the writing of a nineteenth century author seemed a little stilted to this twenty-first century reader.<br />The wording was at times difficult to follow, but the use of words was masterful. In this present day and age of instant gratification, the flowery descriptions and the lingering way of dealing with the subject causes the reader to slow down to savor the experience.<br />The first half or two-thirds of the book could have been made more concise to hold the attention of the reader. Too much time was taken in dealing with mundane things. There was little action in the first portion of the book. In fact, there were times that she could have taken a less circuitous route to tell her tale.<br />Miss Austen did an excellent job of describing the mores of the upper and high class society. She employed the use of humor and satire in her writing. The overly dramatic portrayals of heartbrokenness and disappointments were amazingly humorous. The social niceties were well portrayed - the practice of leaving calling cards, the pairing of \\"acceptable\\" couples, the importance of not marrying beneath one's status.<br />This novel is a must on a reading list of important works and should give the reader a desire to follow by reading Ms. Austen's later works to watch her development as she progressed in her writing career.<br />-----------------------
B00006RIO7|5.0|Simply one of the best Musical Soundtracks ever produced.  Far surpasses the revival Broadway versions.  The definitive version of the score.  This is the one to own.
B00003CXXM|3.0|Not a bad movie . . . but not a particularly memorable one, either.  It's got a lot of good action, but there's very little exploration of the background or personality of Jason Bourne, despite the fact that this is the central point of the movie.  Instead, it focuses too much on being an action movie, with mysterious people trying to kill him for reasons unknown.<br />This is a rare movie in that the movie is better than the book.  The only thing the book did better was explore the complexity of the main character's past.<br />Pick it up some Saturday afternoon.  It's good for a few hours' entertainment- but if you want a movie that will be a little more memorable, grab the original instead.
6305180261|5.0|What can you say about Guns N' Roses except that they are an amazing... exceptional... unbelievable band?  Although he became more of an introvert throughout the 1990s, Axl Rose is an amazing songwriter and a creative genius.  You can see the natural progression from their first videos like \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" and \\"Paradise City\\" with their natural rawness to the deeper, more in-depth hits like \\"Don't Cry\\", \\"November Rain\\", and \\"Estranged\\".  There is no doubting their place in the history of rock/metal music, and if \\"Chinese Democracy\\" is released, they may write a brand new chapter!

1558216847|5.0|Not knowing that this book had its skeptics, I plunged in head first, never doubting a word.  After reading it and running the entire gamut of human emotions in the process, I decided to write a glowing review to praise Slav's incredible book.  It was here that I first saw the skeptic's reviews, and after giving it some thought I've decided that I believe his story wholeheartedly. I cannot imagine the depth, detail or emotion conveyed in this book was fabricated, or even embellished for that matter.  What could possibly be the reason for doing such a thing?  He's not in it for the money, for he gives his money to the orphanages.  If Slav were in it for fame, his agents would have had him doing the talk show circuit worldwide, and there would already be and A&amp;E Hallmark sponsored mini-series.  No, I think this was actually written by a man who endured an incredible hardship, and this book was his therapy.  I've always considered myself pretty skeptical, so for me to have no doubts, throughout the whole reading of the tale, tells me that this is the genuine article. To reiterate what another reviewer said, even if I'm wrong, and this were a work of fiction, it's an incredible story, a great lesson in man's will to live, and his desire to be free. Buy it. You won't be sorry.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is without a doubt the best movie of 2002. Each song and dance differs from the last, every one of them entrancing you. Catherine Zeta-Jones truly shines in her portrayal of Velma Kelly, the singer that goes from Front Page to No Name. Her acting, singing, and dancing are all flawless. Renee Zellweger, who once seemed to be and odd pick for the lead role, shocked many by her vocal abilities, not to mention dancing skills. She plays Roxie Hart, the girl that always dreamed of being a star but never had a chance...until she was arrested for murdering a man. Richard Gere also showed off his talents as Roxie's lawyer, Billy Flynn. The story of fame, celebrity, and murder will suck you in with it's seductive song-and-dance numbers. If you are someone who is looking for a two hour escape from reality, this film is for you.
B00008VGK0|5.0|The song that has received so many comments in the past month or so finally appears in its remixed form. And here, the song is transformed into 5 different versions. <BR><br />Version 1: Missy's collaboration with Madonna here is actually a shrewd attempt at winning urban airplay. Though not exceptionally spectacular, it is nontheless a funky remix with Missy Elliott's rapping and a delightful Tweet on background vocals. The original song is stirpped of its electro coat and laced with hip beats and a funky bassline. It's really a Madonna exclusive as Missy puts it.<BR><br />Version 2: Oakenfold's remix of the song is certainly one of his best for Madonna. In fact, the remix has made the song more radio-friendly. It's Oakenfold at his mid-tempo best, adding to the song some stronger beats and more cohesion to the verses and the chorus. Slick!<BR><br />Version 3: Felix Da Housecat's remix is simply the best on this CD maxi-single. Even better than his haloween sounding remix of Die Another Day, the DJ injected some dark electro-funk to the song and made it sound almost like what The Smashing Pumpkins would have done before. Totally smashing!<BR><br />Version 4/5: Basically, the 2 parts, at nearly 20 minutes, see Rahoufer at his worst on Part 1 and his best on Part 2. Part 1 is just a nonsensical mix of trance beats that made no sense of the song at all. Part 2 is better, more anthem-like with a stomping feel.<BR><br />The last track of the CD is Richard Vission's excellent remix of Die Another Day which was previously unreleased, but it is really the best of the DAD remixes. The James Bond theme is instantly turned into a club track that will bring the house down in no time.<BR><br />Overall, this is a very good CD-maxi single.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|This album was a big let down after waiting 2 and a half years for something this medicore. THis album has some songs that stand out &quot;re-align&quot;, &quot;i stand alone&quot;, &quot;faceless&quot;,and &quot;i F--king hate you&quot;, but other than that, it's just the same old formula that brought AWAKE to extreme boredom after awhile. Sorry guys, better luck next time.
B00005O438|5.0|Featuring a rabid St. Benard who turns into a vicious killing machine who traps a wife and child in a broken down car in the middle of nowhere, Cujo takes suspense to a whole new level.<br />Sure, the first half of the film is pretty paint by numbers stuff that features no horror and gore whasoever, but that was so you can get acquainted with the characters.... Cujo is technically an innocent victim of an evil disease, you can see that King didn't want this to be the typical \\"evil dog vs. caring owners\\" storyline... but basically ir comes down to a dog named Cujo getting bitten by a rabid bat. He then goes on a killing spree. Tad Trenton and his mom go to a farm to get their car fixed. Too bad when they get there, the people who were supposed to fix the car get killed by the dog. Then, the car breaks down, and all hell breaks loose.<br />The problems with the movie are few, but deadlier than the vicious streak of Cujo. The movie is too boring early on, and the ending ... a big one. Plus, the DVD features no extras whatsoever, just improved sound quality and scene selection. The visuals are the same as they were in the 80's, so dont expect anything too great.<br />This is not a revolutionary film by any means, but Cujo delivers what King wanted it to: a tale of evil vs. good, but with shades of gray. And Cujo just looks too cool to be ignored for long. I reccommend seeing this movie without a doubt. It is one of my favorite horror movies of all time.
B000001FDQ|4.0|It's always hard for me to read reviews of Yngwie Malmsteen's albums, because they always tend to fall into two categories: first, the aspiring guitar players who put more emphasis on Malmsteen's skill with his instrument than his actual music and whose sense of hero worship for Malmsteen leads them to venerate his recordings based purely on the speed of his soling (\\"if you like REAL guitar playing, check this out!\\"); and second, the pretentious would-be music journalists who feel compelled to dismiss anything he does based purely on the fact that he's Yngwie Malmsteen (\\"he plays with no feel, it's all just mindless speed and fireworks,\\" etc.) Neither perception of Malmsteen's work is very accurate, and both are wrong for the simple reason that there was much more to Malmsteen's early work than mere guitar pyrotechnics and flashy speed-of-light arpeggiated solos -- a fact that his worshippers don't seem to care about and that his detractors refuse to acknowledge.<br />Malmsteen does, in fact, play with a good deal of feel and emotion on this album. His love and enthusiasm for making music show through in everything he plays here. And of course, at this point in his career, Malmsteen was still a guitar virtuoso of the highest order. Even though Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had been the first heavy metal guitarist to incorporate classical scales into a hard rock style, and Ozzy Osbourne's late right-hand man Randy Rhoads had perfected what would come to be known as the neoclassical style of heavy metal guitar, Malmsteen built on their work, creating a fully-formed and innovative style. Make no mistake about it: Yngwie Malmsteen is an exceptionally talented guitarist, and this album was one of the last moments where he actually demonstrated it.<br />But what both Malmsteen's fans and his critics fail to realize is that there's a lot more to look at in his music than just instrumental prowess. \\"Rising Force\\" is made up of genuinely good songs. \\"Black Star\\" isone of the all-time great rock instrumentals; it's one of the few Malmsteen instrumental composition that's actually built around a signature riff and contains a distinguishable solo (and what a solo it is!), rather than the entire song being the solo. The same can be said for \\"Evil Eye\\" and \\"Little Savage.\\" \\"Far Beyond the Sun\\" and \\"Icarus' Dream Suite,\\" by contrast, feature Malmsteen using a technique that Joe Satriani would often employ: namely, letting his guitar take on the role of \\"lead vocalist.\\"<br />The real lead vocalist of Malmsteen's band, however, was a talented young self-taught singer named Jeff Scott Soto. Soto is one of the finest vocalists in all of rock music, but on this album he rarely gets a chance to show it. His vocals are only featured on two tracks, neither of which lets him show what he's capable of. \\"Now Your Ships Are Burned\\" makes terrible use of his amazing range, and \\"As Above, So Below\\" only hints at the feats of vocal brilliance he would achieve on Malmsteen's second album, \\"Marching Out.\\" As it is, Soto manages to hold his own on this record and sound convincing, even while singing Malmsteen's sub-par lyrics.<br />Both \\"Rising Force\\" and its follow-up, \\"Marching Out,\\" see Yngwie Malmsteen in rare form, as his amazing instrumental talent is actually matched by the music he uses it to create. It's just a shame that most people -- including those who actually like Malmsteen's style of playing -- don't allow for him to do anything musically interesting, which is what he was most certainly doing on this album.
B000050XEI|3.0|Well, theres afew things to say about this album. Its a great album to sit down and listen to when you just want to relax and unwind, however, it tires out quickly. You will love it and listen to it religiously for a month or two and then youll never want to hear it again. I still listen to it ocasionally when i want to relax but other then that i dont listen to it anymore. i think this album is more worth downloading or getting a burned copy then buying it but i definetly reccomend listening through it at least once. The songs dont seem that good when you first listen to them, but they grow on you eventually.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I love six feet under. Its full of wit and elevated sense of humor which only elevated intelligent minds could conceive. Its made with subtlety and above all GOOD TASTE. I dont know if theres going to be a 3rd season I HOPE NOT! The ending was perfect, it cant be touched.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Of Madonna's past past three albums this by far shows how well Madonna can reinvent herself. &quot;Music&quot; was more techno/pop and dance music. There were'nt really that many slow songs that showed her real talents. &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was also a great album because it had some dance music and slow songs, all in one &quot;package.&quot; BUT,&quot; American Life&quot; truly shows Madonna's real talents. Her songs have true meaning and substance. Her album combines techno/pop with meaningful ballads. This album is by far the best to date.
B0000640VN|4.0|As long as you're not an uptight person as some other reviewers seem to be, you'll like this movie.  We're not all professional film critics - although this movie did receive two thumbs up - so the rest of us who just watch a movie for entertainment purposes will enjoy Kate and Leopold.  Not an oscar winner by any means, but still a cute romantic comedy worth seeing.  It is entertaining and I believe that is the purpose of watching a movie - to be entertained by it, not pick it to pieces and over analyze it.  Lighten up with Kate and Leopold and just enjoy the film!  I would buy this movie.
B00008VGL6|4.0|You gotta hand it to Martin, he rarely surprises, that being a good thing. Sex, religion and death are his main themes and he doesn't seem to stray too far from them. This is the Martin we have known and loved for the last 20 years or so. He hasn't changed a bit on this album. Appropriately titled Counterfeit2, it seems to take off where the last one ended, this time with a wider selection of songs and a bit more diverse musical instrumentation. The arrangements are familiar, signature  sparse electronic sounds and textures you can find on any Depeche Mode album. Highlights include \\"Stardust\\",\\"Loverman\\", and the piano-driven \\"Lost in the Stars\\"  Of course, all in all, Martin is best just being himself. This collection is a nice afterthought, but not nearly as interesting as his original work in Depeche Mode.
B00004TRD8|5.0|James Cameron has always been at the forefront of great film making. When he made the Abyss, nearly everyone was convinced he was something special. Well, Terminator 2:Judgement Day is his crowning glory.<br />The plot is simple.  A young boy, John Connor (Edward Furlong) is destined to become the leader of a resistance against an army of machines bent on destroying humanity.  The machine's A.I. soon figured out that wiping out John before he becomes this inspirational leader will make their task of world domination much easier.  So, they send a cyborg assassin(Robert Patrick) back through time to kill him.  However, the resistance know of this plan, and send their own cyborg(Arnold Schwarzenegger) back through time to protect John.  The scene is then set for a gripping and explosive game of cat and mouse as one machine tries to kill, while the other tries to protect.<br />What i loved about this movie was the contrast of characters. Arnie plays a heavy, superstrong solid metal bruiser, while Robert Patrick plays a sleek, superfast and very stylish killer.  The confrontations between these two warriors are inevitably explosive and great to watch, and what is even better is that the action sequences are not repetitive.  There are new ideas for every set piece, each one using great camera work and jaw dropping special effects.  It is the special effects in fact, that still make this film a CGI benchmark.<br />The real genius in the area of computer graphics was the creation of the Liquid Metal T-1000, the assassin sent to kill John.  This cyborg can shape change to mimic any person, and also to turn it's various body parts into brutal stabbing weapons. This could have been utterly botched, but Cameron has created an awesome piece of movie work.  When you watch the liquid metal sequences, remember that there were no advanced computers involved-this was all done using about 10 apple mac computers linked up together. Stunning.<br />The basic story is nothing new. Humansversus machines in a worldwide fight to the death has been seen in a lot of movies.  Well this movie is different.  Adding the time travel aspect to the Terminator movies was a master stroke, and the Terminator movies will remain as all time masterpieces of film making.  The first film was good-this film is amazing. An essential addition to any DVD collection.
B00005JLR2|2.0|I must admit that I bought into Disney's hype machine on Treasure Planet, and I wish I hadn't.  Treasure Planet is a pathetic movie.  Nothing is orginal at all, there's no character development.  It's like they took a bunch of ideas from previous kids movies and threw them into this mess.  The animation, which was one of the big reasons I wanted to see it, was nothing special at all.  I wouldn't waste anytime watching Treasure Planet.  Lastly, Treasure Planet didn't fail because of production fiascos, the reason it failed is that it's just not very good.
6305127638|5.0|As good as Ster Trek gets dramatically, and a fascinating, even moving commentary on technology.  It can be evil, dehumanizing, even seductive like the Borg, or yearning towards greater possibilities, like Dr Cochran's Whole Earth Catalog-like bunch of friends converting an abandoned weapon of war into man's first warp-drive starship.  None of this would be worth much, of course, if you couldn't just kick back and enjoy it as well.
0380789035|3.0|Having really enjoyed Gaiman's previous works, I was looking forward to reading 'American Gods'. When I finished the book, my feelings were mixed. I've encountered the idea of gods existing only because we believe in them (and subsequently, being reduced or dying because we stop doing so) before, in Terry Pratchett's 'Small Gods'. However, the latter book is much more haunting and disturbing in the execution of the main theme than is Gaiman's work. 'American Gods' gives you plenty of small, interesting stories embedded into a few larger ones which somehow fail to take off. The fact that it could have been so much more is disappointing. Shadow, the main character, is dispassionate and cool in the face of events which should have mere mortals running for them thar hills, so you tend to be as well. Christianity, a major belief of American society, plays no role. Gods are killed without there being any significant impact on people---kinda weird if you consider the death of modern gods. The wrapping up of the major plotline is over before you realise what's happening. 'American Gods' is not badly written: Gaiman is certainly too talented for that. There are beautiful scenes which bear his unmistakable style: the story of the happy, and mysteriously thriving town of Lakeside is my personal favourite. But to see those highlights appear in subplots which are (too) loosely connected to the main one gives you the distinct impression that Gaiman overstretched himself. It's a nice book and will keep you occupied for a while, but it's certainly not as great as 'Neverwhere' or 'Stardust'.

B000089A07|3.0|A lot of people are comparing this film to 'Manhunter' and the rest of the triology. I haven't seen any of these films, so maybe my view is less biased.<br />I think this is a solid production, but I agree with those that found it somewhat hallow. Ratner laments in the commentary that he wanted the actors sticking to their lines, and that 'nintey-seven percent, maybe more than that' of the film holds true to the script. This might explain why Keitel's character comes across somewhat one dimensional. He didn't have much room to work. <br />The best scene in the whole movie, to me, is Phillip Seymour Hoffman when he's sitting down waiting to talk to Will Graham -- he's slumped over in his chair, completely bored. It's only a split second, but it's one of the rare parts of the film that evokes much personality. <br />I also enjoyed the twist ending. Poseurs might complain about this, but this is stuff audiences enjoy. <br />There are some more quibbles (how Emily Watson's character responds to Finnes seems contrived. Few women wouldn't find him creepy. Also, more scenes should have been shown of his co-workers reactions toward him). But overall this is a solid production. Maybe fans feel a need to be picky, but this is just entertainment. This isn't Fellini (despite the producer's relations to him). Some of the critics here seem to be criticizing for the sake of it, but what's new?
6305350205|2.0|After Leonard Nimoy scored hits directing Star Trek III &amp; IV, William Shatner stepped behind the helm for this fifth installment, which is undeniably the worst in the motion picture series.  Here we find Captain Kirk, Spock, and McCoy at odds against a renegade vulcan (and Spock's never before mentioned half brother) named Sybok who is searching for God.  While this may sound like an intriguing idea, it certainly isn't presented as well as it should have been thanks to the derivative story, flat direction, and poor special effects.  The only redeeming qualities about Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, is the beginning scene with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy at Mt. Yosimetee (Sp.?); this scene is very comedic and perfectly displays the acting chemistry between the three.  The DVD itself is typical overpriced Paramount bare bones DVD fare, however with the re-releases of the previous films getting very nice Special Edition packaging, it isn't entirely out of the question that this installment, along with all the other films leading up to Nemesis, will get some kind of re-release treatment (especially this one considering the rumors of a substancial amount of scenes cut from the film).  All in all, this is the worst film in the series, but it's still worth a look.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Sentient viewers will recognize Speilberg is in way over his head when this dog opens with written text that explains its premise, then moves immediately into a scene in which a professor actually LECTURES us on the film's alleged theme. We are then taken on a  formless, haphazard journey through a spectacularly ill-conceived future in which bad guys round up robots while floating around in moon-camouflaged hot-air balloons (yes, you read that right) and the general public congregates in outdoor arenas to watch glorified toasters get thrown into kevlar fans. The word &quot;assinine&quot; doesn't even come close. Towards the end of this flick we get the words &quot;Two Thousand Years Later&quot; superimposed on the screen, which is one of the best unintentional laugh-getters I've ever witnessed in a theatre. Thankfully, this turkey only SEEMS to last two thousand years. Without question, &quot;A.I.&quot; is one of the worst big budget movies ever foisted upon the public.
B000002UDG|5.0|First off, I have to say that this title is a misnomer.  To consider any work by Sir Paul McCartney \\"the best\\" without counting the work he did with The Beatles is a little unfair.  That said, \\"All The Best' is a well-concieved collection of the highlights of Paul McCartney's solo career (up to the late '80s) and his work with Wings, one of the more innovative pop bands of the '70s.  It's a definate must-have for any pop collector or casual McCartney fan.<br />There are rock tracks like \\"Jet\\" and \\"Junior's Farm\\" that show the harder edge of \\"Me Decade\\" pop, schmaltz like \\"My Love\\" and \\"No More Lonely Nights\\" which show off Paul's sensitive side, and goofy ditties like \\"Silly Love Songs,\\" \\"Say Say Say\\" and \\"Let 'Em In\\" that border on cheesy but are instant classics.  Paul McCartney's tastes in music during this period ran from the sublime (\\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey,\\" \\"Live And Let Die\\") to the slightly ridiculous (\\"C Moon,\\" \\"Goodnight Tonight,\\" \\"With A Little Luck\\") which only adds to the appeal of this release.  Not only is everything well-done, this disc has definate variety and a sense of humor.  1970s and '80s pop hardly gets better than this.  Buy this one without hesitation.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD flat out kicks [butt], but like everyone else thinks, its WAY too short.  Its alright tho, bc every song has enough attention to it that there are no fillers.  This is definently better than hyrbid, lets just hope they dont reanimate this cd into [junk]...DEJA VU
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna has finally managed to create a CD without one noteworthy, enchanting song on it.  This CD, if one doesn't listen too carefully, sounds like one really long, really dull song.  If one DOES listen carefully, one is assaulted by perniciously dreary lyrics like &quot;I'm not religious... you make me want to pray.&quot;  Blech.  While we're at it, what's with the voice filters?  It is to be hoped that in future endeavors Madonna will either return to form and create mindless, perky pop or give her proposed CDs a listen and decide that they're too pedestrian to be unleashed on the public at large.
0517548232|4.0|I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off!  Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!!  This dork probably marches against the WTO.

His songs will have you running the gamut of emotions: &quot;cannonball&quot; will make you ache while &quot;eskimo&quot; will etch a smile to your face.  Check your papers and catch his American tour, through June. His live show will leave you speechless.
B000084T18|4.0|This is probably one of the best rap debut (although this isn't really his debut) cd's I have heard in a minute... I understand and condone the numerous comparisons 50 has been getting to the late, GREAT, Tupac Shakur.. Although 50 may lack the elevated intelligence that Pac demonstrated in his lyrics, he is a lyrical mastermind, has a tight flow not to mention like Pac.. he is gangsta to the core. This cd is solid... although the lyrics aren't very diverse (most about violence), he still finds a way to switch it up and offer a bit of variety with party hits such as, &quot;In Da Club&quot; and a more mellow, sensitive 50 on, &quot;21 Questions.&quot; Top tracks on the cd are:<BR> &quot;Patiently Waiting&quot;-- between Eminem's flow on the cd and 50's lyrics this track is superb<BR> &quot;Back Down&quot;- 50 really gets a Ja Rule on this and it is hilarious!<BR> &quot;P.I.M.P&quot;-- This song is the truth!<BR> &quot;My Style&quot;- Catchy lyrics and beat<BR> &quot;Many Men&quot;- 50 gets real on this track and addresses the haters <br />But trust these aren't the only hot tracks--- so if you haven't copped this cd.. GET ON IT!
0385486804|5.0|Sometimes in life there comes a point when people need to discover their adventurous side. The question is how adventurous do you want to be? Are we talking overcoming a fear that you have had for your entire life? Trying a food that looks absolutely disgusting? Adventurous is all in the eye of the beholder, but in 1990 Christopher Johnson McCandless brought new meaning to the word. After graduating from college, he gave his life savings of $25,000 to charity and left town. He left behind a loving family, bright future, and his identity. His plan? To get away from the life that he knew and start a new one, one without the corruptions of society. He wanted to go Into The Wild.<BR>     <BR>The novel Into The Wild, written by Jon Krakauer, tells the story of Christopher Johnson McCandless. Chris was a young man when he left Atlanta during the summer of 1990. He would be on his own for almost two years. In August of 1992 though, his decomposed body was found by a group of moose hunters in the Alaskan wilderness. The novel is compiled of stories from family, stories from people he met along the way, and his journal entries. The author does an excellent job of telling the story with such limited information and the order that he compiles them is fantastic. In between the stories about McCandless he also includes stories about himself and his expeditions, and also a story about another youth that had the same fate as Chris. In addition he also includes viewpoints from people about McCandlesss story. This was the major theme of the book. He was praised by some for his sense of adventure and his courageousness, and then criticized by some for his stupidity and lack of preparation for his trip into the wilderness. <br />Over the course of the book there are several arguments made that would suggest Chris was doing the right thing. First and foremost despite what anyone says, Chris McCandless knew what he was doing and was somewhat prepared for the Alaskan wilderness. He had been an outdoors type person all of his life. When he was twelve, he made it up to the 13,000-foot elevation mark on Longs Peak in the Rocky Mountains. Not only that but most people forget that Chris had been on his own for almost 2 years living off of the land and creating a new life for himself. He had been as far south as Mexico and had many near death experiences. He knew what he was getting himself into, and he actually did manage to survive in the Alaskan wilderness for several months. He tried to leave but high water made it nearly impossible for him to get back to the main road. He did something for several months that many people could not do for a week. Despite all of this evidence, many people still felt as if Christopher McCandless was nothing more than a victim of his own carelessness.<BR>     <BR>Personally I see nothing positive at all about Chris McCandlesss lifestyle or wilderness doctrine. Entering the wilderness purposefully ill-prepared, and surviving a near-death experience does not make you a better human, it makes you damn lucky. This opinion was one of many that were sent to the author following the release of his story in the magazine Outside. Many other readers shared this viewpoint because they felt that McCandless wasnt very prepared for his journey into the wilderness. He didnt bring with warm clothes, enough food, and many other items that would have helped him survive. His story can be looked at as a triumph of the human spirit, or a bright future lost in the wilderness, depending on how you want to look at it. <BR>     <BR>     I would most definitely recommend Into The Wild to just about anyone. It is very well written and regardless of what you think about Chris McCandless, you will enjoy this book because Jon Krakauer tells the story like no one else could. Whether you are an outdoorsman or not, you will be able to relate to some part of this novel.
B00005JLRT|5.0|great acting, great writing, great special effects--this sums up star trek nemesis, one of the top 3 or 4 star trek films in the series. without betraying the spirit of trek, this outing brings a refreshing darker, edgier tone to the trek universe moreso than the previous films.<BR>AND,...as with all great trek (or any) film's keystone hallmark, this film has a FORMIDABLE and sinisterly devised villain--3-dimensional, at times pitiable, but mostly scary and nefarious...a most worthy adversary for picard and crew; this film lives up to its name!<BR>the cast is seamless in their roles, while writer john (\\"gladiator\\")logan shows his encyclopedic knowledge of all incarnations of star trek--look for several written and visual references all trek fans will love--including several welcome cameos. WRITE ANOTHER ONE MR LOGAN!!
0810945797|5.0|I never saw this book the first time it was released, so when I saw this I ordered it imeadiatly.<BR>What a georgeous book! Lovely illustrations throughout tell the story of this delightful Hensen masterpiece. From a friend of mine who had the original she says this book has many improvements and additional material not in the original release including a lovely sketch book attached to the back cover of more of Brian Froud's conceptual art for this film. Also in this edition but not in the original are some shots from the film but they are not behind the scenes shots with people or pupeteers but just nice artful shots of the Dark Crystal characters and scenery that only enhances the beauty of this book.<BR>If you are a fan of this film this book is worth the price and even if you still own the original this book improves on the original and is worth buying.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Look linkin park are a fine band, but it really disapointed me how they still use those gay scratchings and chesters voice is still the same weak. This album is just like hybrid theory, i was hoping they'd be a bit different. Any way i think linkin park are overated, and when i hear about people saying they are so talented, it makes me feel sick and feel sorry for biohazard and faith no more, which where makin nu metal when bands like linkin park, limpbizkit and korn where in their diapers, and plus afterall if it wasn't for faith no more and biohazard, stupid linkin park wouldn't be alive, so you little kids who try to be metal heads and bow down to linkin park, please reminde yourself everytime you hear linkin park that faith no more and biohazard where the ones who influenced linkin park, and really how is linkin park talented, i mean chester, his voice isn't that great i mean most of the time he does this annoying high pitch scream, and i don't get whats good about his lyrics, to me there very boring. All his songs are based on the same lyrics, and if you think their guitarist/bassist is talented, why don't you go check out some pantera or metallica. So overall i think you should stay away from this album, it might be fun to listen to a few times, but believe me it will get so boring. Oh yeah, by the way to all you tennie boppers who think im being unfare, well i don't care if you press the no for whether my review was helpful because the truth hurts doesnt it, you just cant take it that their are many bands better than them.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I liked this film better than the first. I think what I enjoyed most about this film is that it captures much more of the story than the first film did. Mostly because it only has two new characters to introduce; Dobby the house elf, brilliantly animated and very realistic looking and Gilderoy Lockhart played macnificently by Kenneth Brannagh. I was thrilled with everyone's performance in this film and the DVD has some great deleted scenes to watch. I just wish maybe they would consider taking these scenes and doing like Lord of the Rings and releasing extended versions of all the films so we can get more of the story!<BR>What I like the most about this DVD is that you don't have to play any stupid games to get to the extras! Although these discs seems much skimpier on extras than the the first set, there is no making of film or interviews except some short questions answered in one section. I'd really like to see some more conversations with Kenneth Brannagh, Daniel, Rupert, Emma and the rest of the cast. Although, the interview with JK and the script writer was fun.<BR>So I give the film 4.5 stars and the discs about 3.5 stars for the lack of any really interesting extras except the deleted scenes.
0060922583|4.0|An inspiring read. Absolutely fascinating. Got me especially interested in the work of David Bohm, and what reality really consists of.
006092988X|5.0|I have seen the video twice for this story and did not realize how much was not included until reading the book!<BR>This is a timeless classic. It reminded me of Angela's Ashes but<BR>with greater sensitivity.<BR>Do not let this one pass you by.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I didn't buy this album until after the Grammys but that's because of inertia.  I heard Norah Jones playing solo and duets on Marian MacPartland's Jazz show and I thought, &quot;Hey this girl can swing&quot; and so does this album.  <br />No it's not &quot;pure&quot; jazz -whatever the Miles Davis that is. And I'm not surprised &quot;avant-garde&quot; people aren't impressed either.  Perhaps some of you were confused because the album was put out on Blue Note. Well, the answer to that little problem is that Ms. Jones didn't want the pressure of putting out a gazillion follow-ups in 6 months, so she chose a label that emphasizes quality over quantity. <br />In any case I really feel I have to add my own voice in Norah's defence. This was a very nice mellow album. As other people have already said, it deserves to be judged on its own terms because it is not a pure &quot;genre&quot; album. <br />In my humble opinion, it compares favorably to Cassandra Wilson's material in spirit but it's not the same as Cassandra Wilson's stuff because Norah ain't Cassandra, or Nina (god rest her soul), or Billie or any of the other great vocalists.  Maybe Norah is still a singer (rather than a vocalist) at this stage in her young life but she's already a helluva lot better at it than a lot of the so-called critics who seem to be so enraged by this album.<br />So most of the writing credits on the album belong to other people (in particular the monster talented Jessie Harris).  Big deal. There's a very long tradition in music of playing other people's tunes. No-talent artists, like oh Louis Armstrong did it.  Just because you wrote it yourself, doesnt make it better.  <br />Of course a lot of really good music gets no support from the industry because it's hard to pigeonhole.  I know there are lots of artists out there (like Jonatha Brooke for instance) who have the same level of talent and musicality as Norah but who aren't getting the commercial attention.  <br />But really, is thather fault?  Is she out there messing with their headsets, amp-cords and fx boxes? People need to put their anger where it belongs: on the industry suits and not on the performers who manage to get some recognition. <br />Norah Jones has paid her dues.  And to my musical taste, she's a lot more happening than Mariah or Whitney or other &quot;pop divas&quot; have been in quite a while.<br />This is a great album.  If you are fixated on some &quot;tradition&quot; (jazz, country, Gregorian chant) then you probably won't like it. But if you have a taste for something that mixes a lot of different influences in emotionally vibrant, deliciously sashaying, intelligent, acoustic music, then this is the album for you.
B00007G207|4.0|This review is for the \\"new version.\\" If you are like me and absolutely have to watch the new version no matter what, then I suggest not reading the ongoing. On the other hand if you don't mind peeking into the new version before purchasing the DVD, read on.<br />The 51 extra minutes in the new version is devoted to the rendez-vous of Toto with Elena -- Toto's first love, whom he met as a teenager -- in their later years. These scenes are inserted around the scene in which Toto converses with his mother after returning home from Rome after 30 years. In brief, Toto runs into a young lady who surprisingly resembles the young Elena; he pursues her and finds out that she is indeed the daughter of Elena. Toto meets with Elena and talks about days long past...<br />Many minutes of the extra footage are wasted on Toto trying to find out how he and Elena missed each other on the day Toto departed for Rome. Equally if not longer minutes are spent on explaining how all that happened. It turned out that on the day of departure Elena did come to see Toto at cinema paradiso, albeit a bit too late. She greets Alfredo instead. Alfredo persuades her to allow Toto to leave. As had been portrayed in the original version, Alfredo sees a great future in Toto, and for this he asks Elena to understand. He pretends to Toto that he did not hear from Elena.<br />I am tempted to make an intellectual argument that, by creating an additional character -- the old Elena -- important to Toto, Tornatore had made the plot of the wonderful original messy (Remember the scene where cinema paradiso gets blown up? The poignancy of that scene gets lost due to the additional footage). However I won't use this argument. I was disappointed by the fact that Alfredo had to be reduced to a liar, whereas in the original Alfredo had remained the one who cared for Toto the most, the one who believed in Toto the most. Ok, ok, I admit that I am attached to Alfredo. But if you weren't, you wouldn't be reading this to begin with, would you?<br />There are stories better left untold. I had no concrete examples of this saying till I watched the new version.<br />If you are like me, you'll watch the new version regardless.
B00008H2LB|5.0|first off the album is wikked awesome.  i've heard it about 20 times already and it hasn't gotten old.  well done.  secondly i'd like to say something to all the people that gave this album 1, 2, or even 3 stars for the matter.  WHAT WERE YOU SMOKING WHEN YOU WROTE YOUR REVIEW!?  come on.  this cd is wikked awesome.  one dude said it was the same old 2 voice kind of songs.  STUPID!  their 2 vocalists only have 2 vioces.  1 person = 1 voice.  get it?  i read other people compare linkin park to korn or limp bizkit.  come on!  korn!?  limp bizkit!?  dude!  that's just stupid!  ooooh, they both play guitars and make  noise come out of their face holes, but that's where the similarity ends.  linkin park is way cooler.  nuf said.  some other dude said he got sick of them cause the have the same old sound.  did you expect them to change to folk songs?  come on!to sum up my review i have to say that you guys need to quit sippin on the hateorade:-(.
B00008RH3L|5.0|This movie should be required viewing for the genre, right alongside The Godfather -- and frankly, I like Miller's Crossing better.<br />The camera work is beautifully done, the music perfect, and the acting is all good -- and some of it is truly outstanding, particularly Gabriel Byrne's and Albert Finney's performances.<br />One of my favorite scenes in the movie involves Leo (Albert Finney), a few assassins sent to kill him, and some very enthusiastic gunplay. I won't spoil it, but watch Leo's cigar, and his facial expressions. Albert Finney is GOOD.<br />And Gabriel Byrne was so good as Tom that I've never been able to watch him in any other movie without thinking, \\"Where's his fedora?\\"<br />The setting of the Prohibition Era is perfectly rendered, yet the characters are perfectly archetypical and the story is timeless.<br />Anyone who likes Gangster Movies must watch Miller's Crossing.<br />(And I cannot resist this response to one previous review: Anyone who thinks it's \\"boring\\" should TRY WATCHING IT, instead of fast-forwarding through it looking for the explosions and car chases.)
B00000DFSK|5.0|This is like Zeppelin IV, Dark Side Of The Moon, Crean Of Clapton, etc...  If you are a fan of U2, then this is a MUST HAVE in your music collection.  Now that the hourly plays on the radio stations are passed us, it's great to put these tracks in the player and enjoy them all over again.  We forget how much we loved these songs til we here them play years later.  Love them again like they're new!  Only you know the words this time.  Of course, you'll need to get the 1990-2000 collection also. :-)
B000003CMB|5.0|1971 - The Allman Bros. were in the process of rippin' the roofs off of every theater & college gym they visted. Some people got it, some people didn't. This record is truly the standard for which all live albums should be judged. This band was truly \\"on fire\\" during this period. Creatively, there was nothing like The Allman Bros; kick-... rock with jazz syncopation. Nobody did it then, and nobody's done it since. The late, great Duane Allman was out there soaring with riffs that were truly innovative. Melodic was their underlying theme that many bands never could grasp. Berry Oakley, on \\"lead bass\\" provided 1/3 of the driving rythym, the other 2/3's by Butch Trucks & Jai Johanny Johansen. Truly a rythym section whose chemistry has never been replicated since. Gregg's soulful B-3 & vocals provide, in many instances a gospel soul that cradles the music. Dickey Betts, as Duane's melodic partner provides a slightly harder-edged but stunning complement to Duane's playing. True magic is the result when their twin-lead interplay meanders, and then ultimately reaches a crescendo that can only be on par with sorcery. The tracks are bold, and take a back seat to no one. The arrangements too, are daring, dangerous, and are executed flawlessly with bravado and simultaneous grace. These tracks document 2 nights of magic during a time when nobody had seen or heard anything like them.(read the liner notes to Miles Davis' \\"Kinda Blue\\" for more insight.) The signature Statesboro Blues begins it all with a \\"shot across the bow\\", Done Somebody Wrong continues the climb, Stormy Monday embraces the T-Bone Walker blues standard gives it a quintessential Allman Bros. treatment and rocks it like nobody's ever done. Duane's solo is truly amazing, yet totally appropriate. Then, there are the jams: Hot 'Lanta, Memory of Elizabeth Reed, You Don't Love Me, and the crowning, Whipping Post. There'e not enough room here to give them justice, but these are the jams that have structure, however remain improv at the same time. You Don't Love Me, based on King Curtis' soulful tune displays Duane & Dickey's individual and combined artistry. Whipping Post, the classic tale of a lover done wrong, drives hard, eases up, meanders, and then drives hard at the finish. They probably all had their eyes closed the whole time, just feeding off of each other's energy & groove. These guys were all in their ealy 20's, playing like seasoned lifelong consummate pros. As Whipping Post ends, you can hear the fading intro to Mountain Jam starting in(from Eat A Peach). Can you even imagine?<BR>BUY THIS RECORD. SEE THIS BAND LIVE. RUN, don't walk.

0689835604|5.0|I bought this book about 1-1/2 month ago, when my boy was about 8 month. He usually fuzzes alot during meal times. Every time when I read this book to him, he'll stop whinning immediately and becomes very quiet, every time. It's amazing. It's a very simple board book, just 4-5 words on each page, pictures are adorable but not too fancy, I love it. Such a good book, highly recommend.
0141301155|4.0|Charlie and The Chocolate Factory<BR>By Roald Dahl<br />Just imagine that your have just found out that a famous chocolate maker of you town has a contest to find five different golden tickets, inside a candy bar rapper.  If you find a ticket you win a tour of the giant Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. While you are on the tour things happen to the children like getting sucked up a tube of chocolate, chewing a piece of special gum that turns you into a big giant blueberry, getting attacked by squirrels throwing nuts at you, and being sucked into a television that's chocolate and getting turned into a midget. And the whole time you must not touch or eat anything that is not tested and be fully aware of everything. <BR> <BR>For Charlie Bucket this was an extraordinary visit to the biggest chocolate factory in the world, in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, By Roald Dahl.<br />In this book Charlie Bucket and his family including his mom and dad and his 4 grandparents, are starving, poor, and live in a very small house with only a kitchen and one bedroom, which everyone shared. As Charlie is walking home from school one day in the cold winter he found a dollar bill on the sidewalk. He decides to go to a candy store to by a chocolate bar and run home to give the rest of the money to his mom and dad to by food. Instead the chocolate bar he had was so good he had to have another. As soon as he opened the second chocolate bar he saw a flash of gold and he stood there amazed he had found the last golden ticket!<BR> <BR>In Charlie and The Chocolate Factory weird things pop-up all the time. One incident was this: Charlie was the last person to stay for the tour, and Willy Wonka had a glass elevator that could go every where from up, to down, to sideways, even diagionally. Charlie didn't know it but Willy Wonka had a special trip for him. They walked into the elevator terribly frightened. Willy Wonka pressed a button that said, \\"UP AND OUT.\\" And suddenly the elevator speed upwards-no twistings or turnings and kept going faster and faster. Suddenly they heard a lout crash and saw wood flying all over. And soon enough they saw the whole town under their feet. (Remember it was a glass elevator). It felt to them like they weren't standing on anything. Since it was going so fast Grandpa Joe asked how fast it was going, and Willy Wonka repeated, \\"Candy power! One million candy power!\\" <BR> <BR>If you enjoy fiction stories that are filled with comedy and imagination his book Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is for you.
B00008973Q|2.0|There is now doubt about the quality of this film.  Ths issue is the substandard encoding or transfer used for this new DVD.  Through out the first 40 min. of the film, there are intances of both horizontal and vertical blanking - a static which appears on all vertical and horizontal lines.  It is also obvious that this film was mastered from a film print and not the interpositive -- the blacks are fuzzy and the dark scenes look as if they have a scrim or screen over them.  I also noted two instances of sound drop outs.  <br />All of these are issues which could have been fixed.  It's very sad that greater care wasn't taken with this film, and at the price point which Winstar is charging, they should have at least tried to get it right.<br />Hey Winstar -- third times the charm.....

But so far Deep Blue Sea has to be the best shark movie of all time. All I will say about this movie is that it is not your typical shark flick. Trust me on this people!

B00008PW3O|3.0|First, the good stuff: namely, the playing. Lindsay's guitars are great, concise and tough, from acoustic sounds to wildly textured electric/synth noises that stretch and crunch. Stevie's voice is strong and confident, and the way her voice locks with Lindsay's is classic. Mick and John are, as always, a force of nature, and thankfully Mick's playing is not masked by too much of that awful 80's machine sound as it has been in the past. But I do have a couple of problems with totally enjoying this album. One of them is the way it was mixed. I dig alot of the experimental sounds and effects, but on many of Lindsay's songs, his voice is mixed so low that there is just no way to hear the words he is singing, short of headphones, with the lyric sheet in hand. Which leads to the second thing: the lyrics themselves. I think we are all used to Stevie songs that seem to make sense only to her, and there is no shortage of mystic fog here. \\"Until she herself/Became the toxic garden/Always frightened/No future at all\\"...and it just goes on that way. (Stevie's voice, by the way, is up in the mix). But Lindsay seems to have taken some cues from Stevie, lyricwise. Many of his words are, depending on your viewpoint, either impressionistic or obtuse. And he has recycled two of his songs. \\"Bleed To Love Her,\\" from the mega-successful live album \\"The Dance\\" has smooth harmony vocals by Christine McVie (apparently her only contribution to this CD, although the liner notes don't say). And \\"Steal Your Heart Away,\\" which in the '80's only rated as an obscure B-side, returns here as one of Lindsay's nicest offerings. Then there are the hits. \\"Peacekeeper\\" seems to be a pro-war song. Then again, maybe it's an anti-war song. Or maybe it's not about war at all. Who knows. It's a nice, catchy song. Stevie's \\"Say You Will\\" is also catchy, maybe too catchy, as I was tired of it after the fourth listening. It will probably be a huge hit after \\"Peacekeeper\\" drops off the charts, and we will have to hear it thousands of times. Oh well, it could be worse. Fleetwood Mac fans will want this album. Stevie Nicks fans will want this album because Lindsay produces her better than anybody has since \\"Belladonna\\". For the casual fan, if you don't have \\"Tusk\\", Fleetwood Mac's best album, go out and get it. If you don't have Lindsay's incredible \\"Out Of The Cradle\\", go out and get it. It's better than all the post-Tusk Mac albums put together. ABOUT THE ENHANCED DISC FEATURES. What you get: Four more songs; one of them a Dylan song that doesn't fit Lindsay very well, live versions of \\"Peacekeeper\\" and \\"Say You Will\\", and one more throwaway tune from Nicks. You can also stick this disc in your computer drive, and if luck is with you, view 6 \\"making of\\" video segments. As far as I'm concerned, this part was better than the album itself. The clips are less than a minute and a half long, and the sound [is bad], but they offer a rare glimpse into the recording process. Lindsay's short rendition of \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" on solo acoustic is totally cool. Watching John overdubbing a bass part and Stevie working on lead vocals while Lindsay produces...they should make a whole DVD of this stuff.
0553296981|5.0|The diary of Anne Frank is an outstanding book written by Anne Frank, a girl of thirteen years of age.  This book is chronologically written, starting on Sunday, 14 June 1942.  The Diary of Anne Frank is a true story that tells how the Frank family, the Van Daan family, and an elderly dentist, Albert Dussel, lived while they were in hiding during the Second World War.<br /> The diary of Anne Frank expresses to the reader the innermost thoughts and shows how she matured and grew in knowledge from the age of thirteen to fifteen. She spoke her mind and did not fear to tell the truth. Anne explains in her diary how she was forced to leave her Montessori school and attend the Jewish Lyceum. She tells when and why they went into hiding.<br /> Anne's diary, which she called \\"kitty,\\" tells of a life of Jews waiting in fear of being captured by the Nazis. She tells of her love and first kiss to Peter Van Daan. Anne's diary ends on August 4, 1994, when a Gestapo raid on the secret annex exposes their hideout. In March of 1945, Anne died in the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsenk, two months before the liberation of Holland.
B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles were on the verge of quitting touring when this album came out, and were also starting to experiment with mind-altering drugs, and behaviors such as meditation. They were beginning to stretch out their creative muscles as composers, and were starting to use the studio to a greater degree. This album marks the end of the Beatles as a great Pop group and the beginning of their journey into becoming the greatest Rock band that ever was. The cool thing about this album is that it still predates the studio experimentation and relies on truly great songwriting. Rubber Soul is definitely one of the essential Beatles albums because it, along with Revolver, is so transitional.
B00008S2VH|5.0|When Michael Jackson?s ?Invincible? came out, I was scared away from buying it by the critics, who did a great job trashing the album. When I finally listened to it this past week, I was so disappointed that I have wasted all that time missing out on an outstanding album because a critic told me to ignore it!<br />Don?t listen to the critics for that ?American Life? is refreshing lyrically and groovy musically. This has to be Madonna?s best album after ?Like A Prayer?. There is a great flow of words and music from one song to another. The style of music (predominantly pop electronica) is consistent and very catchy (highlights: Nobody knows me and Mother &amp; Father).<br />The album also includes classic-to-be Madonna songs. Nothing Fails, which is reminiscent of Like A Prayer, is sweet with a riveting gospel chorus. X-Static Process and Easy Ride are mystical and very personal.<br />To be honest, I cannot think of a single track on this album that is mediocre or just OK. Like ?Like A Prayer?, this album is a journey in its entirety; a journey that is set to entertain and satisfy your yearn for great music, and of course, for Madonna.<br />The poster accompanying the CD is awesome. I have it posted in my office for everyone to see (it does start very interesting conversations, I can tell you that!)<br />I totally recommend this album for all music lovers out there.
B000089RVX|5.0|This album is great. Have to be honest that I've been listening to it nonstop since i bought it. I think I've become obssesed with Amy Lee's angel voice. She just draws you in with such a melodic sound. The songs are great. Everything a debut should be. Fun and interesting. They really do have the potential to become a major force in music. Buy this CD. I guarantee you will enjoy it to the max.
B000002HEP|5.0|I was a fan of Kyuss right from the band's beginning. Their previous release Blues for the Red Sun was an immediate classic, but I was definately not prepared for their follow up. Welcome to Sky Valley is the definitive stoner rock album, and it will rock you out, take you places you've never been. It's essential for all fans of stoner rock and psychedelia. Also worth noting is the absolutely awesome follow up, ...And The Circus Leaves Town. Please, give both of these spin. They will never leave your stereo. Trust me.
6301247485|1.0|The movie version of The Great Gatsby, was very concise with the book. I was surprised that the lines were said word for word. It made the book become real, and I was finally able to see certain places that I couldn't picture in my head while reading the book. I believe that while the settings and events were accurate some of the actors that played their character could have been chosen better to fit the part. <BR> The performance of Nick played by Paul Rudd did an excellent job with his character. In the book I was always picturing Nick to be this man that was relatively quiet, boring, and the most normal of all the Great Gatsby characters. In the movie that's exactly what he played. He did a good job looking very glum throughout the book, and I believed his character very much. <BR>As for Gatsby, who was played by Toby Stephens, I feel they could have found someone that would have played the part better. I pictured a character that looked older, and wasn't so perfect looking, (hair, teeth, etc.). I just feel that he didn't play up to his role, and when he spoke I didn't feel as though the movie was as real anymore, because I don't think he fit the character. I also think it could be due to the fact that finding an actor for the role of Gatsby would be difficult because Gatsby is such a hard character to play.<BR>The movies accuracy to the book was extremely concise, and fitting. I totally believed it, and the director, (Robert Markowitz) did an excellent job keeping things parallel with the book, instead of putting a Hollywood spin on things. The characters were mostly played well and were accurate with the exception of Tom, whom I thought would be a much heavier and stouter character, and Myrtle, whom, I thought would have more beauty to her than she did. Even though she played such a small role, I though that Tom and Daisy's little girl would have been a blonde haired cute little thing, and turned out to have brownish/blackish WILD curly hair. Of course Gatsby,who I felt didn't fit his character well at all.<BR>The production of the film was very well done. The settings and places in the book were extremely concise in matching up with the book. The tone and the feel of the movie were well done also. The book, to me, felt dark and depressing, and surprisingly enough the movie gave off that vibe too.
0440178002|5.0|John Blackthorne is a Dutch trader sailing along in his boat along with his crew when he decides he wants to find the mysterious Japan he's heard so much about. However time and fate have caught up to him. A storm bellows up and strikes his ship. His ship crashes into Japan and he is washed ashore. Once awaken he stumbles to adjust to the monarchy as samurai may wield there swords at will kill whom they please.<BR>        After finding his crew he can only be slightly relieved as there ship is under siege by samurai control and there are more to these traders that meet the eye. They are thieves with stolen merchandise and two stolen rudders. While the crew sits in custody and wait to be found out they begin to go crazy. Casting blame and anger. A verdict is finally reached, guilty. The items are found and with the Japanese the punishment is simple. Depending on the crime you have 1 of many ways of execution. Held in captivity where any retaliation resulted in being dumped with fish guts, silt, and infested water, they were given 1 choice. They may be let lose if by the next morning they choose 1 person among them to die. They only exception was it could not be Blackthorne. The high lord Toranaga had plans for him. Toranaga was a daimyo, which was basically a ruler over a part of land. He was planning a secret war that would finally bring him to the title of Shogun, the almighty ruler of Japan. He is scheming to use Blackthorne's skill as a pirate to bring him to victory. It's a story of love and war as Blackthorne falls in love with the beautiful Mariko, who is his personal translator. Throughout the story all Blackthorne wants to do is get to his ship and crew and get home safely.<BR>         The story is very strong and is one of the best stories I have read. James Clavell has created an amazing cast based on some fact and some fiction. It is historically accurate and once the plot is set you will be reading for hours.<BR>         You must bear through a good partof the first book; there are five books within this gigantic adventure, as it is introducing the characters, tries to show you Japans lifestyle, and how different and difficult a stranger in a strange land can be. However, this is no different from any other great novel. The way I see it, the longer time taken to build the plot, the more vivid and amazing the story will become. This is a excellent book and I recommend it to everyone. James Clavell is an amazing author and I look forward to picking up his earlier book entitled Tai Pan.
0684859106|1.0|To be fair I have only tried one recipe - the Chocolate brownies with Cream cheese frosting and they were in a word horrible - I have never had such dry brownies before - I ended up pitching the batch - what a waste of good ingredients!  Maybe I will try another but then again maybe i will just stick with the tried and true Rosies Bakery cookbook.
B000008LOV|4.0|If you listen to either of the two Traveling Wilburys' albums, you are hearing what good production really is.  Super Group is a nice way of putting it.  George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne AND Bob Dylan!  Its almost laughable that these guys actually got together and made the records ... first, you see who is in the band.  Then you hear it.  This really is a terrific album, why?  I'll tell you ... because you hear trademark input from each individual member and because when all of the various parts combine, you hear the beautiful sound of perfect Acoustic Guitar, tight Drums and Bass, extremely apt Vocals and Lyrics and all smoothed over by the genius of George Harrison's Lead-Guitar.  Its just magnificent - its The Traveling Wilburys.  Do check it out.

0312955006|3.0|This is a book worth reading -- a compelling plot with interesting twists and turns.  Protagonist Harry Bosch is neither too perfect, nor too flawed.  His girlfriend has her own personality, motivations, and job;  she's not there for mere decoration.  The quick conversations between Bosch and Chandler during courtroom smoking breaks are a nice touch.  The aspects of the case which cause Bosch to examine his own past, and motivations, separates this from the too-common &quot;good guys versus bad guys action&quot; type books.  It's also good to read a book which doesn't rely on a deus ex machina ending.<BR>There are a few bloopers along the way.  Lawyers would not abide a US district judge who commented on their opening arguments to the jury with &quot;They may make some highfalutin allegations, but just because they say it doesn't make it true.  After all, they're lawyers [pronounced lie-yers].&quot;<BR>A real estate agent would be unlikely to hold an open house because she has two interested buyers.  (Open houses are held to _get_ buyers, not because you have them.)<BR>Improper statements made in court are _not_ &quot;struck from the record.&quot;  If the statements were deleted from the record, it would be impossible to argue their effect to the court of appeals.<BR>If an attorney died, attorney fees would still be owed -- to the attorney's estate.<BR>If Mora's divorce took place in California in the mid-1980's, mental cruelty would not be a ground of divorce -- that was eliminated in 1970.  Connelly's use of the term &quot;loss of consortium&quot; is outside the usual context -- the term is usually used in cases where an injury to one spouse prevents marital relations, not a divorce where a spouse decides to stop relations.<BR>In all, it's a worthwhile and entertaining book for a day or two's good read.  See if you can figure out who the Follower is before Bosch does!
B00005JLWN|2.0|When firepower outweighs logic, you've got the making of a silly movie that borrows blatantly from LOGAN's RUN, FARENHEIT 451 and THX 1138.  EQUILIBRIUM looks like one of those movies where a highschooler is asked to imagine Aldous Huxley meets THE MATRIX and the results are hamfisted, derogative and frankly insulting to intelligent sci-fi fans who should be looking for originality rather than body count.<br />Bale, who used to try for 'next big actor' is now going for the next Van Damme in FUTURE COP, er ROBOCOP, er TIME COP, no EQUILIBRIUM. He seems to excel now in playing gritty-lo-no-emotions (see or don't see his last turkey, REIGN OF FIRE). <br />This low budget MINORITY REPORT sci-fi movie has poor production values and a Cadillac Allante as a 'futuristic car'. But the biggest crime this movie commits is to waste a talent like Emily Watson who looks a little silly playing the emotional damsel in distress to Bale's Van Dammy hammy emotion cop.  The logic in marketing this movie is to placate people waiting for THE MATRIX sequel.  I'd rather rent a sci-fi original than waste time on this plastic bit of tripe.
B00006RU5B|5.0|What more can I say except that...Soundgarden + RATM = Perfection. This is what the music scene has been missing for so long. They let rock stand on its own without adding rap that seems to be the formula for todays bands. This album is excellent and definetly worth buying.
B00008VGK0|3.0|think it's an ok track for madonna, but absolutely love the 'felix' remix and am disguisted bij missy's one. however every now and then i find myself humming and shake a litlle to missy's one; maybe it's grower,dunneu! peter's and paul's ones are great too, but love the one from peter lot's more!!! <BR>i believe this track is not representable for the rest of the album, and what's 'die' doning on it, can't believe it, it's somehow a little out of place. but the rest of the album is awesome!

B00004SAAX|5.0|Helmut Walcha expresses the Bach I love!  Straight ahead, with no needless gimmickery, Walcha leads you: observing the strictest contrapunctal discipline renders delightful textures and transcendent polyphonies.  The beauty of these pieces makes me cry. <br />The recording space puts you in the organist's seat; together with Walcha's registrations, the results are the best I have heard, both performance-wise and recording-wise.<br />I am anxiously awaiting the CD release of Walcha's \\"The Well Tempered Clavier\\" on ARCHIV.
1582432678|5.0|This is such a timely topic--a troubled adolescent who committs a school shooting--that you think the story would be predictable, but it is anything but.  Shriver gives us the parents side of events in the form of letters from a wife to her husband.  The reader is given all of the facts early in the story--yet the book has unexpected and mesmerizing plot turns.  Really makes you think about the relationship between parents and their children, and our ability to delude ourselves.  Great read!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I just bought this film.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to find (check out my review date).  For anyone collecting Disney animated features; GRAB IT NOW!!<br />  What can I say about the film that hasn't been said.  Despite its' age (The first successful animated feature)it has some of my favorite Disney animated moments.  This film carries with it a sense of real innocence and purity of story that has not been acheived since.  Here is a list of what I liked about this DVD and Film;<br /><br />THE FILM<br /><br />-Again, purity and innocence of story.<br />-Dance sequence in dwarfs cottage, one of the most joyful in film history.<br />-Dwarfs mourning over the Princess, one of the most heart-wrenching in film history.<br />-As benign as the Princess is, she has moments of incredible charm and like-ability; \\"YOU must be GRUMPY\\" hits the nail on the head!!<br />-Wicked Queen starts the Disney tradition of villains with a bang.  She's so mean and crazy she taunts skeletons in her dungeon; \\"..WANT A DRINK!?\\".<br /><br />-Artwork is dated... ...and icredibly charming. The colors used are breathtaking.<br />-Songs are timeless.<br /><br />THE DVD<br />-Quality of picture and sound as good as can be expected for the time of original production.  You really must nit-pick to find a flaw.<br />-Extras are overwhelming!!<br />-Dopey's mine ride is a cute little game.<br />-Deleted scenes a real treat.  One of them actually fully colored with backgrounds.  \\"Musical Soup\\" is hillarious!<br />-\\"The Goddess of Spring\\" short film is very interesting.  It's use as a \\"test\\" for the Snow White concept is obvious.  Some good chuckles for it's crude execution.<br />-The worst thing with this DVD is how difficult it is removing the disks from their hubs.<br />-I wish Wide Screen existed when Disney made this film, just imagine....<br /><br />Why the first Successful animated feature?  There were other(s?) made before Snow White, including Max Fliechers \\"Gullivers Travels\\" which rushed production to get to theaters ahead of Disney.  However, no previous attempt captivated audiences minds, hearts and money like \\"Snow White\\".  \\"Snow White\\" validated the financial side of making an animated feature.<br /><br />Regrettably, I've owned this DVD for 24 hours so I have not had the time to view all of it.  However, it's safe to say that I love it so far!  I'm not an \\"easy\\" critic for what that's worth. I know this is a pricey DVD even by Disney standards.  But consider that my collection of 200 DVDs has an average price of $11 and I do not regret this purchase for one minute!!!

0385504209|5.0|A murder at Louvre museum with more deathly consequences than originally imagined, sets into motion plot upon plot with secrets that may or may not be best if revealed. Who do you trust? That's the question Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu must answer, and this is only the beginning. This book will lead you on a crusade that in the end makes you wonder how far are we willing to extend ourselves to hurt, help or protect another.<br />One thing I loved about this book is that it seemed real. So often books are written where you find yourself saying, \\"That wouldn't happen\\" or \\"Come on, give us (readers) some credit here.\\" Not only was this book entertaining, but I learned things that made me in the end say, \\"Wow!\\"<br />It's difficult for me to find many books that cause me to stop and say to others, \\"You must read this book.\\" One author who comes to mind was Og Mandino. Personally, I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code, and I take my hat off to Dan Brown for this obviously well researched piece of Da Vinci-like work!<br />Vanessa Davis Griggs<br />Author of: Promises Beyond Jordan

B000005RXH|5.0|Like their 1970 self-titled debut, Supertramp's second album, 1971's &quot;Indelibly Stamped,&quot; was critically-acclaimed but didn't exactly set the cash registers ablaze. Still, the band continued to evolve, as they stepped away from the psychedelic rock of the first album and honed their trademark jazz/pop/rock hybrid sound that would eventually sell millions, starting with &quot;Crime Of The Century.&quot; &quot;Indelibly Stamped&quot; is a marvelous Supertramp album, and a definite sign of things to come. For the second 'Tramp album, singer/guitarist Roger Hodgson and keyboardist Rick Davies got themselves a new line-up: bassist Frank Farrell, drummer Kevin Currie, and Dave Winthrop on flute &amp; sax. Also, Rick Davies finally stepped up to the microphone for the first time with his first batch of lead vocals. Every single song on &quot;Indelibly Stamped&quot; is an excellent one. &quot;Your Poppa Don't Mind&quot; is a fun keyboard-thumper. &quot;Travelled&quot; is a lovely acoustic number that reminds me of vintage Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and &quot;Rosie Had Everything Planned&quot; is a fine, light &amp; breezy tune about a woman who gets into trouble with the law. &quot;Remember&quot; is pure arena rock all the way (complete with cheering audience), and &quot;Forever&quot; is, in my estimation, one of the greatest love songs ever written, as it says everything you could ever want to say to your sweetheart in a song, and you can slowdance to it. I'm definitely playing it at my wedding, that's for sure! &quot;Potter&quot; is a brief but excellent blast of guitar rock. &quot;Coming Home To See You&quot; is a pure gem, the lyrics in the style of a phonecall from a rude boyfriend to his girl, with the band kicking into a delightful, chugging choo-choo train jam at the end, featuring some outstanding organ &amp; harmonica from Davies. &quot;Times Have Changed&quot; is a classic Davies ballad, signaling his other great, piano-based compositions that would follow. &quot;Friend In Need&quot; is a short but appealingly playful number, featuring some nice 20's-style piano &amp; sax. And finally, Hodgson leads the band in the tremendous &quot;Aries,&quot; a breathtaking 7 1/2 minute acoustic whirlwind. It's a phenomenal piece, another unsung 'Tramp classic. Once again, Hodgson &amp; Davies' singing, songwriting &amp; playing are superb, and their musical chemistry with the rest of the band simply cooks.This second version of Supertramp quickly folded after the commercial disappointment of &quot;Indelibly Stamped,&quot; but, without question, they undeniably laid down the blueprint for the third and most-famous version of the band that would follow with &quot;Crime Of The Century,&quot; with the band's signature jazz/pop/rock sound now firmly in place. &quot;Indelibly Stamped,&quot; like Supertramp's self-titled debut from 1970, is a wonderful buried treasure that no 'Tramp fan should do without.low. &quot;Friend In Need&quot; is a short but appealingly playful number, featuring some nice 20's-style piano &amp; sax.

B00000IN5G|5.0|This album SMOKES! Children of Bodom should offer a money back guarantee that if you don't like this album they will refund your money because no one would ask for the refund. It's really that good. The sound bytes here (CDNow) do the album NO JUSTICE. It's been a long time since I've heard music this refreshing.
0151008116|5.0|I actually finished reading this delightful novel just a few minutes ago.  Martel's prose is delightful and masterful.  The story he weaves captivates and enchants.  I do not understand the few (albeit minority) who did not like this novel... I would contend that they just didn't &quot;get it.&quot;  Like Hemingway, Martel's structure is simple, but pointedly powerful.  Like the deft hand of a painter, he places his words on the page exactly where they should be and does not clutter.  And the story he tells is insightful and thought-provoking.  Truly an unforgettable yarn.  Highly Recommended!

His characters border on (or surpass!) camp but are always entertaining.  This book is no exception and a very engrossing read.  Lively characters and a witty POV make for quick page turning!

B00000K31Q|4.0|&quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; is one of maybe two or three films that rises to the top of the heap in that whole fad back in the late '90s of taking classic novels and plays and adapting them into teen movies.<br />You know all the basics: based on &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, yadda yadda yadda.  What makes &quot;10 Things&quot; rise above its more drecky cousins (&quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;, and anything -- whether based on classic literature or not -- that had Freddie Prinze, Jr. within 50 yards of it) is the fact that this film came with a well-written script, and the director and producers put actors in who could handle the comedy.  In addition to Julia Stiles, major kudos go out to Darryl &quot;Chill&quot; Mitchell (the wise-cracking English teacher) and Allison Janney (the erotica-writing guidance counselor) for their performances.<br />Definitely one to add to the collection, even if it's as a guilty pleasure.
B00006AUIG|1.0|It is horrible and it makes no sense at all. I feel depressed after watching it particularly wasting an hour on this film hoping there will be answers at the end but no!
B00005MP58|5.0|this is an excellent and even enchanting adaptation of austen's novel, mainly for two reasons: the casting is (almost) perfect for every character, even the minor ones; and the film is long enough to tell the whole story w/o hurry or abridgement. the only miscast character was miss bingley. she's supposed to be a 'suitor' for mr darcy, but not only doesn't she look the part, she doesn't really play it either. otherwise, wonderful. i watched it twice in the first week i borrowed this. now: why aren't there any eliza bennetts in this world? i've never met one, and i've known some very accomplished women who are harvard and mit phd's. beauty. brains. and virtue. why can't you find all three in a single girl? sigh!
B00008VGK0|5.0|Reviewer: joon from Singapore<br />The song that has received so many comments in the past month or so finally appears in its remixed form. And here, the song is transformed into 5 different versions.<br />Version 1: Missy's collaboration with Madonna here is actually a shrewd attempt at winning urban airplay. Though not exceptionally spectacular, it is nontheless a funky remix with Missy Elliott's rapping and a delightful Tweet on background vocals. The original song is stirpped of its electro coat and laced with hip beats and a funky bassline. It's really a Madonna exclusive as Missy puts it.<br />Version 2: Oakenfold's remix of the song is certainly one of his best for Madonna. In fact, the remix has made the song more radio-friendly. It's Oakenfold at his mid-tempo best, adding to the song some stronger beats and more cohesion to the verses and the chorus. Slick!<br />Version 3: Felix Da Housecat's remix is simply the best on this CD maxi-single. Even better than his haloween sounding remix of Die Another Day, the DJ injected some dark electro-funk to the song and made it sound almost like what The Smashing Pumpkins would have done before. Totally smashing!<br />Version 4/5: Basically, the 2 parts, at nearly 20 minutes, see Rahoufer at his worst on Part 1 and his best on Part 2. Part 1 is just a nonsensical mix of trance beats that made no sense of the song at all. Part 2 is better, more anthem-like with a stomping feel.<br />The last track of the CD is Richard Vission's excellent remix of Die Another Day which was previously unreleased, but it is really the best of the DAD remixes. The James Bond theme is instantly turned into a club track that will bring the house down in no time.<br />Overall, this is a very good CD-maxi single.
B00008H2LB|5.0|To those who critisize this CD for being too short, commerical CD's rarely break 45min.  That's not a new occurance, it's just a fact.  That said, this CD is definitely a MUST HAVE for Linkin Park fans.  Meteora has every ounce of the power that made me fall in love with Hybrid Theory.  The tracks &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot; stand out on the CD, hiting hard with the emotional depth that made Hybrid Theory so good, while tracks like &quot;Easier to Run&quot; showcase the band's ability to deliver a melodic power ballad that leaves you wanting more.  Meteora shows Linkin Park's growth as a band.  If you liked Hybrid Theory, Meteora will definitely get a spot at the top your CD rotation.

B00005JLR2|5.0|Moviegoers cannot glance once at this movie and criticise or review it. Yes, it's a Disney film; yes, it's based upon {what I believe to be} a wonderful, classic novel; yes, most would look at it as your typical cartoon. Personally, it stole my heart.<br />I don't believe in comparison - comparing anime dubs to the original, the book to the movie - and the same goes for this. This cannot compare to 'Treasure Island,' and vice versa, not only for the fact that they aren't the same. Don't ever compare; it's like comparing apples and oranges and finding the orange better because it's orange. This is my disclaimer.<br />I love the plot, of course. The characters were incredibly lovable to me; I was guilty of finding myself completely charmed by John Silver's hearty chuckle; I giggled madly at Morph and his adorable nature; Captain Amelia just made me grin wickedly on the inside at her wit; I despised Scroop, as you're supposed to - I believed in his malice; I was proud of Jim, I felt for him; even BEN - probably the only part of the movie I wince a bit at - I think was cute and lovable in his own little robotic way. The animation is just beautiful; astounding, even. The effects and the work put into it is phenomenal.<br />I'm not entirely biased; I saw this movie fifteen times, and am namely obsessed, but I do see its flaws. And they are there. But I believe that if you're open-minded and can see its adorable Disney messages within this wonderfully put-together film, then it's a perfect recommendation. If Morph doesn't charm the pants off of you, the sight of Monstressor or Treasure Planet ... or the RLS Legacy ... will. This movie is spectacular - go get it. ^_^
0783226063|4.0|I just recently bought both versions and I have to say Lynch's is  superior to Harrison's but not by much. While with Lynch's is beautifully acted I just didn't like the poor character development in the film, while Harrison's had very good development and it shows in Paul's growth from an at times immature boy into the messiah of the Fremen. But I guess that is probably because of the fact it was on television. Lynch's use of inner-monolouge was very innovative in my opinion and it gave you a sense of how his characters felt if you are not a good reader of human emotion. But the character that stands out in both versions is Kenneth McMillian and Ian McNiece's Baron Harkonnen, due to the fact that they are opposites of each other but yet are the exact same. While McMillian's is crazy and over the top, McNiece is more subdued and you sense a different motive in his giving up Arrakis to the Duke. In my opinion appreciate both for what they are and stay away from the Smithee version, it basically stinks
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna, Controversy. Controversy, Madonna. Aww, I see you've met. There have been some miss-understanding about the first vertion of &quot;American Life&quot; video. She pulled it just as our troops headed out. Some said that she did it only because of &quot;anti-war&quot; visions. I don't believe that. Lets face it people, Madonna welcomes controversy. She always has. Now, If the people actually listened to the lyrics of &quot;American Life&quot; that never would have ven came up. Despite the faul laungiage used in this CD, It Is a great one. Listen closely to the lyrics, the real lyrics and the faul mouth is to only state a point of view, and a message. If you Love Lady M, Then but this CD, or burn it off a friend or dowmload it from Kazza or something, just get it! (Leagully though)
B00005YW4H|5.0|So many of these young, beautiful, female divas-to-be seem to want to use their powerful voices to beat the holy ... out of songs-- with too much ornamentation, too many notes, too much overdubbing, too much that is extraneous to the song itself.  Not Norah Jones, although she too is young, beautiful, and a big star to be, I hope.  She knows the songs, she loves the songs, and she does not use her considerable talents to overpower the songs.  It doesn't have to be an adversarial relationship!  (I blame Whitney Houston and her overblown ruination of Dolly Parton's inoffensive \\"I Will Always Love You.\\")<br />Norah Jones worked on her craft for the love of it in front of live audiences in teeny little cafes and grimy bars, not in front of marketers and test audiences and focus groups.  Her work is honest and respectful of both the music and the audience.  This is an impressive debut.  I can't wait for the next one!
B000002N2Z|3.0|Deftonesfirst album is not an easy listening job at all... This one is -like the title says- pure adrenaline. Aggression and anger. Furious screaming with sharp guitaring.

If you are new to the band I recommend you check those out first. <BR>Not bad, but a bit too repetitive and some more melodies would get this one 4 stars...
0385486804|4.0|Imagine yourself in the wilderness of Alaska.  You dont have a vehicle, youre alone, and the only food you have is what you find.  To many of us this sounds like a frightening situation, but to Christopher McCandless this was a dream come true.  Into the Wild is based on true story about the travels and death of Chris McCandless.  Because McCandless died, the book is told through his letters, journal entries, and accounts of people that he met along his trip.  <BR>Chris McCandless was from a well-to-do family.  He went to college and seemed like a normal college graduate.  Instead of getting a job after graduating, Chris donated $25,000 of his savings to charities, and then set out to travel.  He went by an alias and cut communication with his family.  He drove cross-country until his car broke down, then he abandoned it and hitchhiked.  The people that he met through his travels were very fond of him.  Chris traveled mostly throughout the West.  His travels ended with him dying of starvation on the wilderness of Alaska.  <BR> McCandless wrote to a friend, So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future.  I felt that this quote really explained why he went on his trip.  This quote was also my favorite.  It is something that we all need to think about.  So many of us look for the secure job and disregard what would really make us happy.  I think it took a lot of courage to do what McCandless did.  I do not think that I could just leave everything and travel with no place to stay or destination.  He lived off of what he had learned throughout his life and depended on his people skills.  I really liked that he did what he had wanted to do and not what others had told him to do with his life.  <BR>The author, Jon Krakauer, wrote the book after writing a short article the in the magazine Outsider about Chris McCandless.  He became fascinated with the similarities of McCandless life and his own.  He in turn spent over a year retracing McCandless trip in an attempt to find out all he could about this young man and his travels.  Krakauer integrates some of his experiences into the book.  I felt that this helped the reader relate to McCandless experiences.  It made the reader connect with McCandless as though they were actually with him on the journey.  <BR> I thought that Into the Wild was a great book overall.  I think that if you like adventure books, you would love this one.  The story is much more than just an adventure.  It has many life lessons intertwined into it.  For that reason, I think that most people would benefit from reading it.  I feel the biggest point to ponder when reading it is:  Was McCandless crazy for going out into the wild as little prepared as he was?  As I stated earlier, I thought he was courageous for following his dream and not the norm.  Im going to end with a quotation from one of McCandless last letters in hopes that this will stick with all who read it. Dont hesitate or allow yourself to make excuses.  Just get out and do it.
0156907399|5.0|Virginia Woolf achieves her most sterling triumphs when she focuses, as she does in To the Lighthouse, on the relationships of men and women to the seemingly trivial events of everyday life. In this book, the camera lens is on the interplay of contact between members of the Ramsay family as they vacation (in about 1913-ish) at their summer home in the Hebrides, trying to plan an excursion to the lighthouse.<BR>Popular once again because of Cunningham's novel The Hours (a spin-off of Mrs. Dalloway) and the superbe movie based on the novel, Virginia Woolf's books are once again bestsellers - and that's a very, very good sign.

When this book arrived, we didn't even need to wait for Friday to roll around.  We all sat around the table having a great time, copying the designs and laughing hysterically at the results. When it was time to go to bed, there were cries of \\"Please, just one more\\". The only thing I caution you about is the need to have some stamp pads around when the book arrives.  You'll want to get to it right away!!!!

0385507755|2.0|Author rediscovers a formula: generic addiction + whining + teenage rants + targeted publicity= a &quot;voice of a generation&quot; book.<br />Ignore the hype. Tales of addiction have been done better by others: Permanent Midnight, Jerry Stahl; Junky, William Burroughs; Basketball Diaries, Jim Carroll.<br />Skip on the book and read the interviews with the author. They are more fascinating especially if you're the type drawn to scenes of car crashes and other mishaps.<br />When the book is eclipsed by the story of the author then the book begs closer scrunity.<br />In the naked text without the buzzing hype or the author's testerone fueled rants the story revealed itself for what it was: another story of addiction with promise which sank to the predictable.<br />A story with a hint of substance<br />But lacking.

0486650677|2.0|.<br />This was probably a good book in its day (1950-1970), but<br />it's really old-fashioned now.  A lot has happened in the<br />field of mechanics since Lanczos wrote it.  For example:<br />- Computers are now used extensively to analyze and<br />  simulate mechanical systems.<br />- The modern language of mechanics is much more geometric<br />  and independent of any particular choice of coordinates.<br />  If readers stop at Lanczos, they will have trouble<br />  understanding the modern literature.  He doesn't even<br />  distinguish between vectors and one forms.<br />- Dynamical systems theory / qualitative dynamics has<br />  contributed a lot to the understanding of mechanics<br />  in the past 30 years.  You won't read anything about<br />  stable/unstable manifolds or strange attractors in<br />  Lanczos.<br />The &quot;problems&quot; are so easy that they border on the<br />ridiculous.  And don't try finding them at the end<br />of each chapter --- this book predates modern textbook<br />format.  Lanczos hides his problems like Easter eggs.<br />In conclusion, this book is of historical interest only.<br />If you want to learn about modern mechanics, read<br />something that was published recently.<br />(I should add that the book is well-written, but that<br />doesn't fix the fact that it is dated.)
0679746048|3.0|Seeing as how I'm reviewing books for high schoolers I doubt they could comprehend the deeper feelings that are in this book. <br />A really good book, but may be too complex for average high school students. Having seen the movie before I read the book, made it a little easier to understand. There are a lot of difficult words. Also the book goes back and forth through time. It doesn't flow from point A to point B, it goes from A, to D to B back to A and so on.
B00004Z400|5.0|This is one of my fav CDs of all time. Beautiful, eerie melodies, hard guitarscapes, unbelievable vocals, great rhytmic patterns...

I cant wait for their next album! Deftones are in their own league with these art-rock songs.
6305657947|4.0|I so expected to be disappointed by this remake of Norman Jewison's jazzy, quintessentially 60's caper film. And boy, was I \\"disappointed\\"! The Rene Russo, er Thomas Crown Affair, is AS GOOD as the original.<br />The original has rebellious Steve McQueen, playing a role few people would have believed he could handle -- that of cool-as-a-cucumber, Harvard-trained financier, \\"Tommy Crown.\\" (To Pierce Brosnan: I knew Steve McQueen, he was a friend of mine, and Mr. Brosnan, you're no Steve McQueen!)<br />The original has Faye Dunaway as \\"Vicky Anderson.\\" (Going in, I was tempted to say to Rene Russo, I know Faye Dunaway, ... but we'll get to that.)<br />The original has that jazzy, split-screen look (Haskell Wexler's cinematography), simultaneously showing three scenes. It has great caper scenes. It has the dune buggy scene with McQueen and Dunaway. It has \\"the longest kiss\\" in screen history. (In those prehistoric days, gifted performers were able to put over smoldering love scenes without taking off their clothes!) Not to mention Michel Legrand's score, and the Oscar-winning theme song, \\"Windmills of Your Mind,\\" that Legrand composed with his frequent collaborators, lyricists Marilyn and Alan Bergman.<br />And it has Norman Jewison's (The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming; In The Heat of the Night; Moonstruck; The Hurricane, etc.) very able hands holding it all together. (I wonder if the reviewer who dismissed the original as \\"languid,\\" ever saw it.)<br />The remake, meanwhile, is dragged down by its nominal star. Watching Brosnan and Russo work together, I feel like I'm watching a wonderful fighter (Russo) in a fixed fight, who literally has to hold up an inferior opponent (Brosnan) for 15 rounds (title bouts used to last that long), before letting him knock him out. I'm not saying Brosnan is a \\"tomato can\\" (boxing lingo for a human punching bag); he has a couple of moves, especially in the caper scenes, but he is nevertheless a lightweight who doesn't belong in the same ring with Russo. <br />Well, you know what? This version, which was transplanted from Boston to New York, and changed from a bank heist to a museum job, ain't exactly chopped liver, either.<br />Director John McTiernan is a veteran of Bruce Wilis, Arnorld Schwarzenegger, and Tom Clancy flicks. He knows how to pace a summer movie, and is as good as they come at framing an action scene. The pleasant surprise is how well he handles the little things, the scenes where \\"nothing is happening.\\" For McTiernan's soft touch, together with Russo, make this remake a pleasure worth repeated viewings.<br />The story: Bored billionaire Thomas Crown decides to put some spice in his life by stealing a zillion-dollar painting from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Catherine Banning is the world-class insurance investigator whose mission it is to recover the painting. Det. Michael McCann (Denis Leary) is the local boy, an outer-borough, working-class hero, whose job it is to put Crown away. I'm not giving anything away here.<br />The trick is, that Catherine Banning starts falling for Thomas Crown, and has to decide whether he's really fallen for her, too, or if he's just using her to get away with the caper. And then there's Mike McCann's problem. He likes Crown, and eventually, he falls for Banning, too.<br />In one respect, this movie is like Terms of Endearment. If you don't fall in love with, or strongly identify with Debra Winger's \\"Emma,\\" you won't love Terms. For Russo/Crown to work, you have to fall for, or identify with Russo's \\"Catherine Banning.\\" I fell. Hard.<br />The camera loves Rene Russo. Not that she's beautiful ... anymore, that is. Being beautiful isn't enough to fill the camera, anyway. Very few actresses today can consistently fill the movie screen, and all of them are named Meryl Streep.<br />(TV is different. As much as I love TV, many performers who can fill the small screen are dwarfed by the big one -- think, David Caruso, the original star ofNYPD Blue.)<br />In two of Russo's best scenes, the camera tightly frames her beaten countenance, as she says little or nothing. That she wasn't nominated for best actress was an outrage. It is exceedingly rare to see one performer (think: Gene Hackman, Tom Hanks or Denzel Washington) carry a movie the way she does here. I can repeat the rationalizations for overlooking Russo in my sleep: 'It's a summer movie'; 'It' s a caper flick,\\" etc.<br />As for Russo's much-heralded nude scene, it is gratuitous, and does her no favors. She's obviously past her prime. I was embarrassed for her, and gladdened recently to hear her announce that she will no longer do any nude scenes.<br />But I haven't exhausted the pleasures of this film. Director John McTiernan has come a long way since Die Hard, and he and his screenwriters, Leslie Dixon and Kurt Wimmer, deliver the goods -- split-second timing, devilish cleverness, and a quirky sense of humor -- that only the best caper flicks provide. And then there's that something extra that elevates it -- the movie within the movie.<br />Released in 1999, this film is set in present-day New York. And yet, the most successful caper of the flick may be the parallel time game it plays. It's set in 1999 AND somewhere around 1964. But don't take my word for it. Look at Denis Leary's suits. They're awfully close to what Paul Burke, then the biggest star in TV, used to wear playing a detective in the first great, New York City-based cop show, The Naked City, from 1960-63.<br />But Leary's Det. McCann is nothing like the gruff character played by the middle-aged, suddenly paunchy Paul Burke in the original Affair. This lanky lawman is no jelly doughnut, yet once you get past the tough facade, he has an outer-borough (non-Manhattan), working-class sweetness, poignance, and yes, gallantry, to him that makes me mourn a city that is no longer. There is no room for this character in the City of 1999. I know; I live there.<br />And if you want to see screen chemistry, watch closely whenever Russo and Leary are alone together. Now, HE's a contender!<br />Faye Dunaway pops up in a cameo role as Crown's psychiatrist. As it is unnecessary to propel the story along, a scriptwriting seminar guru would frown on her appearance, which is but one of the luxuries in a great caper movie that refuses to slavishly follow formulas.
0316666343|5.0|The book takes place in the seventies and is about a 14 year old girl that was murdered. It starts off with her telling her story in heaven. The girl who was murdered narrates the book. . She spends most of her time looking down on her family, and her one true love, on earth. She watches them struggle through the hard times that fallow her death. The writing in the book is filled with so much emotion, that I could not stop thinking about it, even when I wasn't reading it. I mourned for the family, and I wished for her body to be found, it was as if this was happening to my best friend.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is such a good film the music is amazing the performances are superb and just everything screams amazing.  this is a wonderful film and totally deserving of your time.
B00001OH82|4.0|Yes when this came out it wasnt typical Bowie fare, but being the master of music he is he reinvented himself once again. AMAZING  is a beautiful love song. He joyious sings out &quot;Since I met you life's so amazing&quot;. WORKING CLASS HERO is still relevent in todays world of tax breaks for the rich, where the common man breaks his back for the betterment of family and society. PRETTY THING has a fun heavy rock sound to it. If you like Bowie or heavy sounding rock this album is for you. Bowie's charisma and charm gives this cd enough spark to make it an enjoyable listen.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I will buy anything Madonna puts out....no matter what!!! I did not like this CD at all, at first. I had to listen to it a few times to really feel it. It kind of get's repetitive with the same \\"Dont Tell Me\\" acoustic sound it has to it. But....it grew on me. There are only about 4 or 5 songs that I like a lot on the CD....American Life, Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails, Mother And Father and Easy Ride. I think it it is only for the die-hard Madonna fans.
6304233639|4.0|In scanning the reviews for this product it appears many of the reviewers took the film more seriously than director Roland Emmerich, his cast, and crew.  INDEPENDENCE DAY isn't meant to be believed--only enjoyed.  It's pure escapism, a vehicle to take us away (if only temporarily) from the trials and tribulations of our busy lives.  This is a science fiction Disneyland, complete with laughs, thrills, drama, intrigue, and heartpounding action.<br />If memory serves me correctly, this was Will Smith's first major role on the big screen.  Not only is he very funny, he projects a commanding presence that subsequently launched his cinematic career.  Jeff Goldblum is wonderful as nervous computer guru David Levinson, and his chemistry and timing with Smith is fun to watch.  Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore stays stoic and reserved, even when crawling into a fighter jet himself to lead one last attack against the evil aliens.  But Judd Hirsch and Randy Quaid steal the show:  Hirsch as Goldblum's eccentric, over-supportive father; Quaid as a grisly alcoholic cropduster, a former alien \\"captive\\" who is given the best line and scene in the entire film.<br />Sure, some of this movie is annoying (Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore giggling the line, \\"Liar,\\" over and over), but when it comes to a white-knuckled sci-fi ride about humanity taking on an alien culture threatening our very existence, INDEPENDENCE DAY delivers.  And, if you don't take it too seriously, you might even have a smile on your face.  So pull up a chair, relax. . .escape.<br />--D. Mikels
B00008S2VG|3.0|The music on this album is great! It is in keeping with the futuristic \\"MUSIC\\" sound but a lot more dancefloor friendly. That being said, Madonna won't be winning any 'songwriter of the year' award for this album. I have never thought Madonna was a particularly strong lyric writer but I didn't think she was weak either. American Life is weak. I realize this album is supposed to be an introspective but I thought it could have been more intelligently written. I gave it a 3 because the music is so strong and ultimately the reason why I like Madonna. Her music.
B0000931QR|5.0|And that's for sure where they will get with their new album. I just bought it yesterday (first day of its release) and I can tell that after listening to it once there were already some songs that I loved. And I had to listen to it once more...and once again...I couldn't stop. Their two previous releases were so good that surpassing them is indeed a hard task, but let's wait and see how people reacts to this new album. I'm sure they will get to everyone's heart like they have done before.<BR>One surprise at the end: the bonus track is a dance track like you would never expect from La Oreja de Van Gogh, but really catchy!
B00008S2VG|3.0|While Madonna is known, and wants to be known, for pushing the limits and never repeating herself, \\"American Life\\" seems to disprove this. Madonna is again working with producer Mirwais Ahmadzai, the genuis behind  2000's \\"Music\\", and with some good results. The catchy \\"American Life\\" is both firey and dancable. Unfortunately, is doesn't quite match up to it's parent album. \\"Music\\" had a varying style range, from the 60's infused \\"Amazing\\" to the club-enduced title track, while this one fails to vary. Each song has weird computerized noises, and each song contains a guitar. But there are some surprises on the album. The deeply confessional \\"Mother and Father\\" is heart-felt and catchy, while not covering any new ground or revealing anything new about Madonna. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is deeply personal and the surprise choir-induced ending is surprising and gives chill bumps to the listener. \\"Hollywood\\" is catchy and fun, and a sure-fire radio hit in the near future. One of the most impressive tracks is a tie in to a mediocre Bond film by the same name, \\"Die Another Day\\". It's enthusiastic strings arrangement, interesting beats and firey lyrics are the makings of a Madonna classic.<br />   While \\"American Life\\" isn't completely boring, it isn't completely revolutionary either. \\"Music\\" gave us range, and \\"Ray of Light\\" gave us a new sound, one that is more worth revisiting. if Madonna wants to pair up with an old buddy, she should give William Orbit a call.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's new album American Life is a wonderful album, and an improvement from Music.  It is successful in creating an enjoyable mix of styles from different musical genres.  The tracks I most highly recommend are track 6, Nothing Fails, track 10, Die Another Day, and track 11, Easy Ride.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This has to be the best Madonna I've ever heard, and I really thought she couldn't top Ray of Light.  The lyrics really touch on her personal experiences, and show how much she's grown and learned as a person.  The music, lyrics, everything about this CD is fabulous. Track number nine especially shows how things she went through have shaped her into the person she is today. This hasn't left my CD player since Friday when I bought it.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Well this is one of her best looks.  G.I Jane and this album &quot;American Life&quot; that i pick up this morning is really really good.  It is an little personal and has some of weridest to it but the bumping thumping beats make up for it.  This is one album you really need to have in your collection.  Man i didn't know that Madonna can bang like this when i put the album in my CD player this afternoon.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is the definitive version of Metropolis.  Every scrap, fragment, and sliver of extant film was used in restoring this film-as best as humanly possible-back to Fritz Lang's original vision.  Due to the age and \\"silent artillery of time,\\" I imagine that this will be as bet as we will ever get.<br />As it stands, film rounds out the st5roy that was sonly seen in sketch and shadow with previous versions,. including Giorgio Moroder's \\"colorful\\" 1984 adaptation.  This version expands upon the rivalry between Rotwang and Joh Fredersen, which was obliterated during the American Editing phase of the film.  \\"Slim\\" is given a bigger role.  We are also introduced to a previously unknown (and still unseen) Cathedral monk who warned Freder about the coming Apocalypse.  In fact, the entire movie takes on a greater religious and biblical tone, especially as we see Futura sit upon the beast with  seven heads during her Yoshiwara's dance scene.  The greatest surprises were with Worker #11811 and Josaphat.  These men get more screen time and they actually become people and are not longer part of the scenery.  But this is the point of the film-to see it as Lang envisioned it.<br />This has a good transfer, especially if all you have seen were the \\"Bargain Barrel\\" versions that look like they were done by monkeys.  The picture is mostly clean, but there are scratches, hairs, and blurs here and there.  I have seen better restorations, such as Disney's Snow White, or Orson Welles's  Othello.  I realize that budgets are always limited, and so I would choose to see bad missing film over good film I already have seen.  There is no reason why we cannot have anther version that is an improvement over this one, and if we buy A LOT of copies of this film, they studios would be more inclined to spend the money to perfect the transfer and quality.<br />I was surprised to see how the dealt with the missing scenes.  They had summaries written and flashed on the screen like inter-titles or address cards.  I approve of this choice where there are no stills, but if there are stills or even sketches, I would have preferred seeing these, since you are looking at something.  This is a movie, and we want to SEE things, not read about them.<br />For example, in this film, we just read about Worker #11811 going to Yoshiwara's, but in  Giorgio Moroder's version, we saw a still of the scene pan across the scnee, then another still of the entrance to Yoshiwara's<br />Similarly, the sequence with the bust of Hel could have been improved  The film is forever gone, so they used stills and cards to fill in the sequence.  In Giorgio Moroder's version, they used a different picture which looked better than the one used in this restored version.  Later in the film, when Rotwang recovers from fighting with Maria and wanders out in a trance, he makes a stop before the bust of Hel, then thinks Maria is Hel.  They have this still of someone with outstretched arms in front of the bust (praying?), and this could have been integrated in the film.  Once again, this film is visual, so I would prefer to look at something-even if it is not moving-rather than reading about something.  Always use an image over words!<br />By the way, why hasn't Moroder's \\"colorful\\" version been released to DVD?  This is the version of Metropolis that I grew up on, and you cannot argue with the soundtrack.  Hopefully, this new version of the film will spur the rights-holders to release Moroder's version to compete with this version.  I'd own both.<br />I love this film.  I think is is the most important sci-fi film ever made.  It was the first big-budget sci-fi film made.  It had a mythic core that does not let you go.  It has incredible story telling.  Even the editorial butcher job could not destroy this film.  After 75 years we are still watching this film, and it's no surprise why.ss cards.

B00005JKHN|5.0|In the small town of Carlsbad California, my spare time was spent looking at the new Disney coloring books and picture books at our local store. This was 1958, and one day, the first copies of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" started arriving. The stylish design elements in the characters and backgrounds just blew me away.  I bought every single book available.<BR>The late Eyvind Earle produced those background designs so full of rich texture, in all locales. In the king's castle, there are the stone walls and tapestries; we can almost feel the metal and velvet inside the jewelry box where the fairies have their conference; in the forest, we see intricately detailed tree trunks and grasses; Briar Rose gazes at the castle in the distance, in a wide-screen Eyvind Earle-type panorama filled with those square-topped trees, the first and last time I have ever seen such a fantastic expression of trees carried out with such panache! <BR>The colors for this film have been described as \\"jewel-like\\", and I suppose the best example of this would be the costumes of the three good fairies. Flora's clothes are orange-red, red, dark red, and pink. If you look at a multi-faceted jewel, each facet is another variation of the basic color. Eyvind Earle put these colors together in a way that I have seldom seen equalled. We might say that he put the \\"beauty\\" into Sleeping Beauty! The colors are absolutely mind-blowing.<BR>Princess Aurora is possibly the most beautiful of all Disney heroines, and why wouldn't she be? She was blessed with \\"beauty rare\\" from birth.  Mary Costa's speaking and singing voice provides the vocal sincerity of this character, never overdoing it.<BR>Maleficent is a very interesting character, especially visually. She seems to be more attractive in her first scenes in the film, almost beautiful. Sixteen years later in the story, she looks uglier. Was this intentional, or did the artists draw her differently as the 6-year production period dragged on? We may never know.  I like the way she looks in her first appearance, at the christening. Her collar is smaller, and her face bears a faint resemblance to the young Briar Rose, even in a foreshadowing way.<BR>Maleficent first appears out of a green flame, one phase at a time. Before she is fully formed, we see only a stark outline of her horns and black robe. When I first saw this apparition in 1959, it triggered a subconscious memory I had of a film I had seen about a year earlier, Hammer Studios' \\"Horror of Dracula\\" (1957). The first moment we see the count, we look up to see him at the top of the stairs, almost in silhouette. The stately figure in the trim black cloak is almost like an icon of that era. If you have a chance, compare the two films. The resemblance at that one moment is eerie and very very 50's!<BR>In the natural world, one can find many things which seem to be perfectly formed: a rose, the Matterhorn,  or a lion. This is how I see Maleficent, as a number of parts that fit together perfectly. From her horns and bat-points to her skinny neck and flame-like sleeves, she looks as she IS. Her clothes are black, because she is evil, and black represents a void. But, she also has purple sleeves, as this color is associated with royalty, and she is an evil queen. Maleficent (as is Christopher Lee's Dracula) is tall, stately, dressed in flowing black, has impeccable manners, moves with grace, and is thoroughly horrifying and hateful!  <BR>Eleanor Audley who provided the voice said, \\"I tried to do a lot of contrasting to be both sweet and nasty at the same time.\\" Through foreign versions of this film on video, I have heard Maleficent voiced by many actresses, in Japanese, Dutch, French, Polish, Czech and Hungarian. The only one that comes close to Eleanor Audley is the Dutch actress, Jasperina de Jong. The voice work requires a rendition teetering on the thin, bladelike edge between kindness and hatred. The original English version is just teeming with it.<br />Another thing I love about this film is the musical treatment. Tchaikovsky's ballet score fills the story from beginning to end, and George Bruns used it and augmented it masterfully.  After watching this film, I very often feel elated, as if I have just been to an art museum AND a concert of classical music at the same time.  Apart from Fantasia, how many films can boast that?  Stunning animation, gorgeous art and uplifting music are here in abundance!
B000006TRV|5.0|And I think I have pretty good tastes for my age!  I remember my cousin singing \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\\" at our new millenium party, and I thought that song was so catchy and hilarious that I just had to go out and buy this album.<br />Truth be told, this album is no joke.  It's the most saddening thing you'll ever hear.  Well, Tool's \\"Aenima\\" and NIN's \\"The Downward Spiral\\" come rather close, but the story of this recording (which I regret to have used internet spoilers to figure out) will make you cry if an album ever did. I guess there is \\"light at the end of the tunnel\\" by the time the album closes.  But on the rugged way there, our drugged-out rockstar just keeps losing his interest in life.  All the lyrics are incredibly poetic, never corny (if you look at them in the right light), and practically anyone who's not too superficial can relate to the subject matter.<br />The music itself is incredible, too.  David Gilmour is still my favorite guitarist, with the most emotional playing style.  Roger Waters writes most of the music and has a very distinctive, paranoid voice.  Nick Mason is an amazing musician as well, with an artful style that's quite rare in drummers.  Then there's Richard Wright, who's usually an astounding keyboardist, but was in a phase of writer's block at the time so he doesn't contribute much.<br />This album is largely the result of unrest between the members of the group, so many Floydians refuse to admit its ingenuity.  But it might have been a good thing that Roger took over the group.  Otherwise, this album wouldn't be as dark or helplessly emotional.<br />\\"The Wall\\" traces the whole life of the imaginary character, thus being a concept album or a rock opera.  I love these things, because they contribute greatly to the feeling of the music .  The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and Queensryche's \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" great examples.<br />The whole 82 minutes of \\"The Wall\\" never ceases to amaze, and it continues to define how rock music shouldbe made.  I demand that you sacrifice [$] and set aside an undisturbed block of time, and immerse yourself in the music.  Or you can go on listening to whatever other crap you're into.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I thought Daredevil was a work of genius.   I have never read  a comic book in my life.  Never understood them.  But I understand this movie.  And after seeing critics divided, and audiences divided, I have come to believe that this is one misunderstood film.  I think that many came to it thinking it was going to be like Spider-man (blame Fox marketing).  But, thankfully, the filmmakers clearly had a lot more on their mind.  Instead, Daredevil gives us the world of the superhero.  What it would really be like to devote your life to fighting crime.  It's dark and unflinching.  And in time, I think this film will come to be considered a classic.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Lovely, lovely, lovely. If you like James Spader, spankings, beautiful sets, and offbeat romance then this is the flick for you. I went in to it knowing nothing; it had been recommended by a few friends. I came out a whole new woman...<br />Definately one for the library. You'll want to see it again. And again. And...
B00005JLPK|4.0|From the top it is a love story, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.<br />We meet Frida as a high school student just before a tragic and life-changing bus accident which leaves her in constant pain for the rest of her life.<br />Diego is perhaps 20 years her senior, is already a successful mural painter. divorced and bedding anyone with big breasts.<br />But what makes it a extraordinary movie is that the director tries to capture the essence of Frida and her art with the movie itself. Pieces are animated and sequences built around her particular paintings. The technic draws the watcher into the artisitic world far better than a strict narrative. Nicely done and effective, somehow he communicates to me, an absolute anti-art idiot, through the media some of the essential Frida.<br />The movie is a riot of color, everywhere, from the changing colors of her dresses, the walls of her home (his is red, hers is blue?, with a skybridge joining them), to the colors of the scarves she braids into her hair. Like color the move is full of sex, straight sex, lesbian sex, sex with models, sexy dances, breasts in murals, naked models, Frida as pain wracked in a body cast but sexy.... Then we have politics, Trotsky, Mexican revolutionaries, comrades singing late into the night, protest parades.<br />And passionate drinking, and dancing, and flower gardens. lust all the way down....<br />But this is all secondary to PASSION. sex, hungry pushy grabby horny sex but not so much as animal lust followed by exhaustion but sex as symptomatic, as pointing to; the real passion for life, despite the pain, despite a unfaithful husband (\\"you were never a husband to me\\") who knew only loyalty to his painting. That is what the movie is about. The passion of a women- Frida Kahlo- in love with life as few people ever are. Most of us are blobs, pieces of animated meat, seldom rising above the level of sentience to trackle the big questions. That is the theme of the movie, to communicate this passion for life that effected everyone around her. Certainly built around her relationship with Diego, with storm and tears, tender late life hugging to temper tantrums galore, always colored by her (and his) art. Walls full of art, from a picture of a young Mao to a mural destroyed because of Lenin's face within it.<br />The big questions: relationship of art to real life, Mexican unjustice and unequal distribution of wealth and therefore opportunities, the right to sensual pleasure free of constraints, the relationship of one woman to one man. This are touched on, but peripherally, even with the affair with Trotsky, it is her passion that draws people to her bed, figuratively and literally.<br />Art communicates differently than does science. Art doesn't use words the same way as prose; straightforward, literal, linear, logical. Rather Art is like poetry; confused, non linear, non verbal, expressive, colorful, sexy, progressive, emotional. The movie, like the woman, is artist(ic). It hits you in a different place than does thinking about something, for it is about identifying with someone, understanding them. I could read a biography of Frida, i might even be able to page through a book of her paintings, but i don't think i would have the same feelings afterwards as i have now having seen the movie. Logic and reason are not the only ways of knowledge, words and books are not the only way to transmit information, this movie shows another way: emotional, raw, images, feeling for someone. Certainly i know these things are manipulated to create a movie, but underneath the need to sell tickets, for the director to get his next movie and his next paycheck, is a bigger, more important issue of what it means to be human. what it means to let out the things inside, to express the creatively, the desire, the needs, the passion inside. And that is the genius of this movie, true to Frida's real personality or not, it shows, and better yet, allows us to experience one special woman's life. Thanks.<br />Go see the movie. it's a good one.anks.<br />Go see the movie. it's a good one.
B00002R0MR|4.0|When you hear that someone's jazzing up Bach, it usually involves adding a few cymbal hits to someone playing straight Bach at high speed. Yes, there's a bit of that here, but when the jazz bits break through, they're really something special. Loussier uses the basic harmonic progression of the Bach but the upper harmonies and rhythms are definitely his and they're pretty funky. Unfortunately, most tracks start with a few minutes of &quot;Bach to cymbals&quot; and I think this manages to ruin both types of music. Still well worth a listen. Track 1 and esp. 3 are really quite funky.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is an awesome cd.You have to give Gorillaz props for being original.I think its awesome that one of the best rappers of all time,Del The Funky Homosapien,is featured on two of the tracks of this cd('Rock the House' and 'Clint Eastwood').If your looking for the boring usual stuff in rock,go buy Hoobastank.If you wan't something original,defintly buy this.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I thought Paul Anderson has done a really good job at directing this movie, and 2 of the cast members doing a funny audio commentary with one of the director's producing buddies.  I'd give this movie 4 stars, because I've been a fan of video game based movies, after seeing Super Mario Brothers in 93' and Paul Anderson's &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; in 95'.  I would have given this 5 stars, if the movie wasn't too short and extended by 10-20 minutes.  But I definitly gotta catch the sequel whenever it comes out.
B00005V1Z5|5.0|I caught this movie on cable after seeing all the media hype and deciding it was not something I wanted to risk paying for at the movies.  What a mistake!  This movie is Laugh Out Loud FUNNY!  Nothing heavy or thoughtful here, just good old fashioned mindless entertainment!  After trying to describe scenes to friends and family (you must see the &quot;walk off&quot; part to understand) I decided to buy the video and let the movie speak for itself!  Ben Stiller is outrageously funny and the whole movie premise is pure entertainment!  If you are looking to be intellectually lifted, this is not the movie for you to watch, if you just want to see something that is hysterically funny and utterly mindless, you've gotta see this one!
0440237688|5.0|The Giver<br /> In the book the Giver by Lois Lowry a science fiction novel. Is a very exciting and adventurous story about a boy in a sameness community. Who sees everything very different from others.<br /> Jonas is eleven year old boy who lives in a sameness community. In the community there are a ton of rules for example you can only have two children one boy, and one girl. Once you reach the age of twelve which on Jonas mind is coming up everybody in December has I big ceremony celebrating there age, and when you are twelve you get assigned a job by the Chief Elder the leader in the community. The most important job you could be assigned is receiver of memory which Jonas was chosen for. He thought he was skipped because she did not say his number. Everybody has trainer and Jonas was the Giver he gave him memories of the past and could see color now because of the Giver but he could not tell anybody about his training. Later on in the book Jonas Dad a nurturer in the community had a job when there was two kids (twins) wit same name they have to choose the one that is the heaviest and his Dad had to kill the other baby. Jonas asked the Giver if he could see the tape of the neutering and he does, and after he has seen he tells the Giver he wants to apply for a release but you are not allowed to apply for a release. So what does he do?<br /> Jonass motivations are when he does stuff like when he tried for an a release he did not think about it he just went and asked for one with out thinking and that is how Jonas is in the book. In every decision Jonas makes he never thinks about it first and then he ends up regretting his decision. He does it because he doesnt know about the consequences or does not think of any consequences that might happen. There for Jonas is a character who does thinks before he acts and later on pays for those mistakes.<br /> Jonas role in the book is he is the main character the center point of the story. Jonas is a wise, brave, persistent boy who sees everything different from other people and that is why he was chosen as receiver of memory. The Giver the man who is training Jonas is also the same as Jonas because the receiver of memory and the Giver are the same thing and thats why they were chosen for that position in the community.<br /> The strong points of the story are that it is very exciting and adventurous, and it makes you think like why did he do this? Another one it was a very descriptive book and, very easy to read and, follow along the author describes every little detail in the book. It is also very strong in describing the characters description and what they do and why. I dont think there are any weak points in the book because it is very, easy to read and, follow along, and follows the expectation for a science fiction novel and, it is very descriptive and, really good word choice. Thats what I think of the Giver a really great book.<br /> By: Derek Rager
B00005A3KS|5.0|Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves, before the days of SPEED and THE MATRIX) is the newest FBI agent and is already working on his most challenging case. The \\"EX-PRESIDENTS\\" are a clan of dudes who rob banks under the mascara of Reagan, Nixon, and others. Utah's new parner Pappas (the legendary Gary Busey, legendary partly for the fact that he always dies; I won't reveal the chances of his survival here) has clues that point to the beaches for the identity of the robbers, because the \\"EX-PRESIDENTS\\" are surfers. Utah must go undercover as surfer to infiltrate the robbers, and soon develops a \\"friendship\\" with the most spiritual surfer ever, Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Did I like it? Of course. There's action, romance, and some very unanticipated comedy. Busey delivers the best and funniest line in the film, \\"28 robberies, and what do we get? One ----ing hair!\\" Reeves and Swayze are great together, especially in a scene where they are just minding there own buisness and get in a fight with four NAZI dudes, or in the bit where Reeves jumps out of plane with no chute after Bodhi. It's all pure escapist with no connection to reality, but escapism is what action movies are all about, and POINT BREAK has enough escapism for 3 movies.
B000002KCC|5.0|This seems to be Neil's response to the happy success of Harvest, an easy-listening record by some standards. I think Harvest is great, also, but this is just a bit more edgy and raw. <br />I read a review that condemned the technical imperfections of this album, but I enjoy them. In fact, I bought this on vinyl, so I am quite the opposite of the other reviewer, who commented that he wanted a Neil Young album, not a Sex Pistols album. Well, I guess I'm happy that my album says Neil Young on it instead of Steely Dan (though I've got their stuff, too). <br />Technical perfection is an aspect of music that doesn't fit certain styles, and overproduction seems to be embraced too often. I personally know engineers that live for perfection and \\"sonic accuracy,\\" but recording is more like a painting than it is a photograph. The more microphone pops, the more it sounds like humans recorded instead of robots in white labcoats. The point is, this album has got great, heartfelt songwriting on it. One of my favorite Neil Young records.
B0000029GA|5.0|The number one most intriguing thing about this LP, aside from the enthralling lyrical stylings of Nas himself, is the last track.  The Michael Jackson hit &quot;Human Nature&quot; is sampled wonderfully, creating a perfect backdrop for Nas to drop his rhymes.  There isn't a more perfect ending to such a great album.
0385504209|5.0|I had misgivings about buying this novel, but after the first 4-5 pages, I was hooked.  This is an absolutely stunning tome of intrigue, riddle solving, cryptic messages, and religious history.  Not your bag??  Guess again!!  I had to force myself to read this novel slowly, so as not to miss any of the myriad clues needed to solve the mystery.
B00008J4P5|3.0|&quot;This band is too garagerock what the backstreet boys were to punkrock.&quot; So you're saying this is the exact opposite of garage rock? What on earth do the backstreet boys have to do with punk, let alone rock?
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am so glad that Christina is finally able to do her own thing. She has said in numerous interviews that when she first made it in the business she was pushed around by a lot of studio big wigs who wanted to make her like another Britney Spears. Now that she's established herself as a talented artist, she is able to express herself more freely, and I'm so glad. I'm glad to get to know the real her.<BR>Oh, and the one reviewer, Francis from New Zealand, he said he didn't know who Christina was because of all the different kinds of songs on the album. I think that shows who Christina is. She isn't just pop, or just r&amp;b or rock or blues, or whatever. She is influenced by all types of music and wants to show all the different sides of her.<BR>Great job, Christina! I can't wait to see you in concert in June!
B000069HP6|3.0|I enjoyed the movie and the visual effects are amazing considering it was the 70's.  I do wish the dvd had more extras though.  It has a briefs story about the creation of the movie and some still pics from the movie.  Nothing behind the scenes or interviews or anything.  But if you just want the movie it's worth the money.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I agree with the loyal Daredevil comic book fans who say this movie is only a commercial tribute to the blind Superhero. The Daredevil character on film is only slightly related to the powerful comic book hero. This is unfortunate because the non-comic book fans would think the two characters are the same. I admit it is difficult to create the complexity of comic book heroes in only two hours. For the film maker, what needs to be done in two hours is make a profit. If the profits are good then a sequel will follow. To do this there is nothing like exploiting a successful Marvel comic book action hero like Daredevil. <br />If the movie Daredevil is compared independently of the comic book Daredevil character then I would have to admit that the movie was worth it. Jennifer Garner made this movie worthwhile with a look, which can only be described as \\"dangerously sexy.\\" I am not surprised that her character, Electra, is being given her own starring role in an upcoming movie. <br />The movie is visually dark but still stunning at times. In some cases the scenes were a bit too dark and some might even say depressing. The darkness is in keeping with the comic book feel but certainly not the depression. <br />This movie is worth a look and even a DVD purchase but it is not the classic that I hoped it would have been.
B000002WYT|3.0|I remember my old friends saying how they thought the DMB was underappreciated and underground.  For a good while I thought they were full of it, considering how this is one of America's most popular acts of today, with sprawling tours of about 60 or so shows a year and sales in the tens of millions.<br />Yet, reconsidering, they really are an outsider group of sorts.  Despite their popularity, they craft songs of epic size, rarely shorter than 5 minutes.  They noodle and draw out songs like the Dead, they employ a full time sax player and violinist (a rarity today in post-prog rock popular music).  Their lyrics on average are fairly coy and beguiling, sometimes even inventive and thoughtful.  Rarely do their songs have time signatures and rhythms shared with other bands.  In a way it's a blessing that such an ecclectic band can top the charts time and time again (alright, maybe a little too much).<br />Even their biggest hit, off this album, \\"Crash Into Me\\" is a strange song to be seen on top of the charts.  With coy, almost sexual refrences in the lyrics, gentle melodies and rhythms, and an overall subdued feel, it seems like the exact opposite of what people usually have patience to deal with.  If only the Limp Bizkits and Linkin Parks of today had such integrity in their music, then maybe radio wouldn't sound so bad now.<br />Granted, their records as a whole come off fairly spotty.  Take the embarassments on this record: \\"Too Much,\\" which wouldn't sound out of place on a Christian children's show about the Seven Deadly Sins (gee, guess which one), \\"Cry Freedom,\\" an overly dramatic and insistent plea to Dave's original home of South Africa, I guess, and \\"Proudest Monkey,\\" about three minutes too long and fairly aimless considering it's the kind of thing DMB's good at.  But besides these droning moments, there's some impressive meat to the rest of these songs.  \\"So Much to Say\\" is one of their most capable pop songs, building up in a nice way with great vocal play from Dave.  \\"Two Step\\" is a sprawler of a song that manages to be successful.  Same with \\"41\\" which, although lyrically meaningless, does feature some of Dave's best singing on record.  \\"Say Goodbye\\" is an honest paean to a last night spent together with the one you love.  \\"Drive In Drive out,\\" a rocker of sorts, gives the record its much needed intensity and bounce, while \\"Lie in Our Graves\\" and \\"Tripping Billies\\" are interesting reflections on the sanctity and fragility of life.<br />Overall, I'm much more glad that the DMB exists at all than to scorn them for being so overly successful.  It's nice that something that actually somewhat deserves such respect and adoration gets it for once.  It's also nice that such a band is given the opportunity and encouragement to grow and develop themselves further ala U2 and REM.  Soon we may see a real timeless classic from them.  Until then, they are quite worthwhile of the attention they garner.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is a really great album and one of Madonna's best work to date.  I personally think that American Life is a much better album than Music.  I don't think that American Life will disappoint any true Madonna fan.  Madonna always manages to bring out something new and catchy in her albums.  The best tracks are &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Mother and Father&quot;
B000056K04|2.0|This will probably end up becoming one of the most famous disappointments in pop music.  Whereas musical left turns like REM's \\"Monster\\" and Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" ended up being successful and full of integrity (note I'm not comparing DMB musically to these groups, just the general concept), here it just seems like a struggle.  It's hard to feel that the band, even Dave Matthews himself, had any fun in creating this record.  Surely the aborted sessions before it had some merit and meant something to the band, otherwise they wouldn't have made \\"Busted Stuff.\\"  That record seemed like the album they were trying to make all along, and they probably felt they were taking much too long in delivering it.  Instead, they wrote this as a quick cash-in.  Despite Dave's insistence that this record helped him get back on track, in retrospect it just seems like a mess, and not in a good way.  <br />The lyrics are embarassingly bad, with themes and nonsense fragments repeated endlessly.  The music and time changes almost hurt the head to hear, and while some are inventive (\\"When the World Ends,\\" \\"Fool to Think,\\" \\"Sleep to Dream Her\\") they make little sense in context.  They just seem to exist for their own sake, as if Dave's trying to disguise the lack of true musicianship on the album.  He repeats the \\"rain\\" metaphor three times, for goodnesssakes!  Nothing here matches the raw emotion of tracks like \\"Typical Situation,\\" the playfulness of \\"Best of Whats Around\\" and \\"Warehouse\\" (can you tell what my favorite DMB album is?), or the driving intensity of \\"Don't Drink the Water.\\"  Even with Dave's lyrical faults, the core musicianship of the band was more than enough to buoy the songs, which made them at least a guilty pleasure.<br />As it stands, there's little here to enjoy.  They try to attempt a change in direction, and I applaud them for that, but despite being a sizable and competent band of musicians they just don't seem to have the dexterity enough to attempt such a stylisticchange.  I believe what they were attempting here was a sort of pop music, a condensed version of their sound, but this was actually detrimental to what made them so good.  I know they're capable of moving in more experimental directions, but intrinsically they cannot really strip down their sound, considering they have 5 separate musicans that all play different instruments.  Some of the better songs, especially \\"If I Had It All,\\" sound like huge chunks were excised from them, or they were half written before other parts were added but they decided to release them anyway.  I just hope in the future that if they decide to experiment that they do it in a better way that accentuates their musicianship better.
B00004X01U|5.0|This album came out roughly three years ago. I bought the album them and listened to it a few times and then put it away. Recently since Madonna has released the new &quot;American Life&quot; and I haven't had a chance to buy it as of yet, I returned to Music to just listen to her again and see if anything could rekindle an interest for me not only in the Music album but in Madonna period. The first 6 tracks of Music still do not stand out to me but by track 7 the album changes and becomes more focused on being good, introspective and often fun music. I am in love with the last 4 songs on Music and therefore I have to give it a full 5 stars for this fact alone. There are two upbeat fun songs in &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;What It Feels Like For a Girl&quot; and then there is the brooding, emotional and somewhat seductive &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot;. Then perfectly closing with the folk sounding &quot;Gone&quot;. These songs make Music come together.
B00005JLSE|5.0|What's with the reviewer that posts all the negative reviews? It's such a good film and everybody I know loved it , You must see it ignore the one person who posts over nad over about this amazing film they are obviously immature.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I have been listening to Madonna since I was 7. It is fair to say that there have been few disappointments in the passing years. I'm sure I'm one of the few die hard fans that truly appreciates the Breathless album. But we are talking about American Life here.....<BR>I'm often conflicted when listening to her later albums because they always seem to set a precedent for pop and yet, the lyrics always seem to be so dumbed down. If she were to set a real precedent I truly feel like she would make a real effort to write lyrics that match her wit and intelligence. <BR>Also, I am so TIRED of that popularized voice effect that Cher introduced to us with \\"Believe.\\" The divine M never professed to have the best voice so why subject us to cover ups. <BR>I like the album well enough to give it a listen on occasion but in the end, Madonna is NOT breaking any ground here in the pop genre. If the electronica route is something she truly wants to pursue, Orbit and Mirwais should not be first choice. I'm not totally devoid of hope though. I know that one day, she will truly impress me.

B00008DDRX|1.0|The movie gets 5 stars, but the DVD package gets 1 for poor effort.  Reason: there doesn't appear to be anything extra on the DVD.  This is one of the greatest racing movies of all time and there isn't any special features, so why would I get rid of my Laser Disc copy?  I would like to see a &quot;making of&quot; documentary or perhaps interviews with the crew 30 years later.  Speedchannel had a great documentary on this movie that should be included in the dvd.  It had great stories from the film makers and Steve McQueen's son.  I'm just a little disappointed in Paramount and the movie's release to DVD.  This great movie deserves more than just being on the new format.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I believe that Enigma's The Screen Behind The Mirror is their best album to date and also my favourite out of all of them.TSBTM as I think some of their best songs,like Push The Limits,Smell Of Desire,Modern Crusaders,The Screen Behind The Mirror,Endless Quest,Silence Must Be Heard and my favourite song,Gravity Of Love.TSBTM is almost the same but almost different from their last three albums but it's just as good if almost better then MCMXC A.D.but this is the one that as struck a cord with me,mostly because there's more songs one this album that I can relate too like Push The Limits and Gravity Of Love.This is a must for any fan of either Enigma or New Age music.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Part-requiem, part-rebirth, Madonna has released her tenth studio album AMERICAN LIFE. Armed with 11 songs, she reveals, admonishes, and shares her perspective on her career, life, and success - in the hope of imbuing and inspiring not only her fans, but the general public. She leaves the occasional jargon of RAY OF LIGHT back in 1998, favoring simple vocabulary, holding nothing back. She's angry (\\"I'm So Stupid\\"), world-weary (\\"Hollywood\\"), loving (\\"Nothing Fails\\"), even paranoid (\\"Nobody Knows Me\\"). In my review, I'll highlight these certain songs.<br />The title track begins the album. Already notorious in the papers regarding her decisions on how to market it, the song is a perfect start for the record, asserting the agenda of her latest project. Full of buzzing synths, syncopation changes, meandering melodies, and a cut-and-paste chorus, Madonna rails against the fallacy of the \\"American Dream\\". The composition sounds jarring and disjointed, but that's its purpose. Included is a satirical rap role-call of some of her employess and possessions. The fade-out features her voice manipulated into a macabre creature singing the refrain repeatedly \\"I live the American Dream.\\"<br />\\"American Life\\" segues into \\"Hollywood\\", a Beatles-esque tune with an apocalyptic undercurrent. Using the famous town as a metaphor, her singing is simultaneously coy and venomous. Guitar chords augment the retro 808 beat and what sounds like (at one point), birds put through choppy filters, coming out clipped and incomplete. \\"Push the button, don't push the button!/Trip the station, change the channel!\\" Madonna challenges us as her voice drops into an unnaturally deep tone.<br />\\"I'm So Stupid\\" completes the first triptych of songs critiquing superficiality, glamour, and materialsim as aspirations and values. Brillantly, these songs also put to rest her \\"Material Girl\\" personae. A spunky beat, electric guitar, and a synth line created from Madonna's voice, comprise this dismayed and angry song. At times, the singer/songwriter yells and labels everyone \\"stupid\\" for \\"looking for something\\" - presumably, the wrong thing. She even assumes an adolescent tone calling herself \\"stupider than stupid\\".<br />\\"Nobody Knows Me\\" reveals Madonna's fear of a \\"social disease\\". What sounds like a dentist drill makes it way through this electro-funk dance song complete with a fierce beat, rubbery bass line, and memorable refrain: \\"I don't want no lies/I don't watch T.V./I don't waste my time/Reading magazines\\". Filtered through a vocoder, she finds solace in an understanding person in a world where \\"people trap your mind\\".<br />The centerpiece of the album, \\"Nothing Fails\\" is an affecting love song to her husband. Her feelings are best described in the fantastic climax, featuring a trio of gospel choir, a choir of Madonna, and the lead vocals: \\"I'm not religious/But I feel so moved/Makes we want to pray\\". Attesting to the transformative power of love, Madonna's sincerity is apparent more so than on any other song prior to this album.<br />The album ends with \\"Easy Ride\\", a Kabbalist song praising hard work, but ultimately leaving more questions than answers. Madonna has been quoted to saying that this album signifies the beginning, not the end that many percieve for her. \\"Easy Ride\\" further drives home that sentiment. <br />I recommend listening to AMERICAN LIFE while in a solitary place or state of mind. It's a frustrating, joyful, inquisitive, and intelligent, and rewarding experience.<br />The CD has recieved mixed reviews in the press. If there's one lesson both Madonna & the critics have taught me is to create my own opinion. A work of art is meant to be moving, candid, altruistic, full of emotion. If so, then personally, AMERICAN LIFE is a work of art.
6305537321|3.0|&quot;Breakfast At Tiffanys&quot; is the vintage romance classic based on the novel by Truman Capote that pits the elegant Audrey Hepburn (Holly Golightly) against stoic George Peppard (Paul Varjack).  He's a would be writer, being kept by a rich, married lady.  She's the lost soul runaway who's abandoned her husband and family after her beloved brother dies while serving his country in the military.  This is vintage Capote.  Even with the glaring omissions to the text and Mickey Rooney's garish, over-the-top performance as a Japanese landlord, this is still one of the all time great date flicks.<BR>Unfortunately, Paramount Home Video hasn't done a very vintage job on this DVD.  They've presented the film in its original VistaVision widescreen process (anamorphically enhanced) and remixed the sound to 5.1.  That's a start.  But the visual characteristic of the transfer on this DVD is digitally harsh, suffering from edge enhancement, aliasing, shimmering fine details, pixelization and digital grain.  <BR>Colors are generally well balanced but there are several instances where flesh tones appear a little bit on the yellowish side.  Contrast levels are weak with black levels usually registering a dark gray instead of black. There's an excessive amount of chips and scratches in the opening title sequence as well as some general color fading associated with film stock of this period. As for the 5.1 surround, it's strident and not very natural.  Dialogue is forward sounding.  The Henry Mancini score is nicely presented, particularly Moon River, but over all this is a mono soundtrack with very few scenes that engage any of your other speakers.<BR>NO EXTRAS!  What a shame!<BR>BOTTOM LINE: This is vintage Hollywood presented at bargain basement quality.  Decide for yourself. I'd wait in the hopes of a complete digital restoration.
B00008DDXC|5.0|When I was a kid, about 5, I remember seeing Willy Wonka and I thought wow, I really would like to get one of those golden tickets.  Now years later, Harry Potter bursts onto the scene and its a great series of movies to sit down and watch with kids.  It actually has great lessons in the film plus its a lot of fun.  Harry Potter is a likable kids and so are his friends and teachers.  The second film is better than the first (for me) because it doesn't have to set up who the characters are.  They brought back the Quiddicht (sp?) matches and the special effects are still first class.  There are not many movies you can watch with your kids and enjoy but this is one of them.  I actually do think that this film encourages kids to read.
B000002JSN|5.0|\\"Physical Graffiti\\" is probably the one album I would own if I could only possess one; and certainly the one I'd choose if I could pick just one from Zep. This was definitely their peak, their zenith.  Starting with \\"Custard Pie\\", it's a record that grabs you and doesn't let go until you're done listening to the last track.  (\\"Sick Again\\") -  Although it will loosen its grip a bit  on the third side - \\"In The Light\\" being the weakest track in my opinion, but Zeppelin never really recorded a bad song, mind you - just different degrees of brilliant.  \\"The Wanton Song\\" seems to get a bad rap from the other reviewers here.  Can't understand why.  It's actually the third best track on the album, with it's catchy driving rhythm.  But it's \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" that is the undeniable centerpiece of it - the one track that makes me want to get down on my knees and pay my respects to the band that recorded it - That one track is the worth the price by itself and is number one on my personal Zep chart of songs - play it loud!  How \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" gets so much airplay on radio and \\"Dying\\" gets none (NONE!) is beyond me!  Essential listening!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Beautiful!  Astonishing!  Breath-taking!  Best action scenes in over 50 years of filmmaking!  This is the type of movie that makes you stand up and take notice.  This is the thought-proviking version of the Matrix, but so much different.  I am buying TWO of them, one for myself and one to loan out.  Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson, Agnus McFadden.. none of these actors are of the blockbuster type, but they sure are great in this amazing, well-crafted MASTERPIECE of Brave New World meets The Matrix.  The action sequences are nothing you have ever seen before.  This is not only a great action film, but it is SMART and STYLISH.  The most amazing thing is that hollywood completely dropped the ball advertising this film.  Heck, after seeing this film, Christian Bale should have played NEO in the Matrix.  Ok, short synposis... nevermind, you can read that yourself.  Just see this movie and you will agree that this film has set the bar really high in stunts, action, and camera use.  And one more thing... the story is extremely well written also.  Bravo to the director and writer, Bravo!
B00005JLK1|4.0|While it is nowhere near as intelligent as \\"The Sixth Sense\\", or even \\"The Others\\", I enjoyed \\"Ghost Ship\\" a great deal nevertheless. \\"Ghost Ship\\" is about a salvage crew stumbling upon a seemingly derelict cruise liner, the Antonia Graza, that had been mysteriously lost at sea forty years ago. The opening sequence, which definitely is NOT for the faint-hearted, had me squirming in my seat. It started innocently enough - passengers dancing on the deck of the opulent cruise liner on the night it went missing 40 years ago - and then exploded into an unexpected orgy of blood and gore that will probably have me swearing off any thoughts about ever getting on a cruise ship for the rest of my life. The fate of the rest of the passengers and crew was revealed with equal violence and gore about two-thirds through the movie. Although predictable at times, \\"Ghost Ship\\" did keep me guessing in its first half. Was that mysterious pilot who first approached the salvage crew with information about sightings of the lost cruise liner more than he seemed to be? Was that ghostly girl some sort of demon who caused so much carnage on the ship forty years ago because she was bored? Which ghost had good intentions and which evil? Julianna Margulies acquitted herself well in her role as a strong and gutsy woman with plenty of maternal instincts, the same sort of role so famously pioneered by Sigourney Weaver in Aliens. While \\"Ghost Ship\\"'s premise is not an original one - \\"Death Ship\\" (1980), \\"Event Horizon\\" (1997), \\"Deep Rising\\" (1998) and \\"Virus\\" (1999) come to mind - it has enough thrills to keep fans of the horror genre happy. So go rent it on a dark and stormy night, make some popcorn, turn out the lights, snuggle in the sofa with a blanket, and prepare to be scared out of your wits in the first five minutes ...
0812550706|5.0|This book has to be my favorite sci-fi book.  Believe the hype - it's all true!
0446677450|5.0|A great book with lots of sound practical advice!  I've been very lucky over the years, by that I mean that I've had the opportunity to explore being an entrepreneur. I started when I was 14, a national magazine on a small scale and what I learned from that I would later articulate in other projects for publishing and even now on Amazon. I went to the Rich Dad seminar in New York this past November. I expected there to be an exhaustive push to purchase the various products available through his company but instead it was a full on lessons in business.  We were actually given workbooks and situations culled from the audience to look at how systems work and their business potential. <br />I will tell you what all of this has helped to congeal in my head. One, money does not exist. Now this may seem to be contradictory to the entire concept of what Kiyosaki's books seem to extort on the surface but it doesn't. Again this is a radical concept, but I think that after a certain number, money is simply a concept.  The majority of people think of working from paycheck to paycheck and what can be done with that money (after taxes usually 50% of one's annual number salary), unless you make a staggering amount you can't get ahead.<BR>What I think the RDPD series gives one the insight to do is recognize all of the systems you're in.  First what your money is, doing a spreadsheet on yourself and your worth, figuring out your goals and so forth and then the legal areas that affect your money.  Most people know how much they make weekly, what that number should be annually but we rarely keep track of WHY those numbers are affected as they are.  The difference between the rich and the poor is that the rich understand the power of their tax contributions and how much they absolutely have to make and how much they don't.<BR>   <BR>Rich people also think about money for sport not only for survival.  Here's a mental game I've learned to play: I imagine what businesses I would build ina neighborhood I'm in, what I can see that would work, what wouldn't, etc..---cost analysis evaluation of places. I also regualrly look at Lotto prizes and figure out exactly how much that money is----10 million after taxes, withholding= 4 or 5 million really isn't that much. <br />This is where it becomes interesting and the book delves into this: How to make money make more money? <BR>We all assume that getting a job is the easiest way to make money and then we assume that a business is so difficult to manage that we don't have the ability to do so. And yet amazingly, I started my first business when I was 7 selling papers, I would buy Sunday papers for 50 cents and sell them for 75 cents because I delievered the Sunday paper early in the winter. <br />Most people want answers. Answers the way your boss tells you to sit there, do this this way, deliver it by this time and then go home. Thats what people miss in this book----being told what to do. But ultimately they want to be TOLD what to do, become rich and then they will have the freedom to be \\"free to do whatever they want\\". Being free is everyone's greatest desire and fear. We have become a society that values conformity over creativity.<BR>People want to read this book and be told, put 5 dollars in a red box for ten years and you'll be a millionaire. Do this the right way and your life will be perfect. This isn't the way to be successful. There are ways of educatingone's self----first books like this. I recommend making a study of the entire Rich Dad Series. You must make a study of first money, then yourself, then what to do with both. <BR>I further recommend Tony Robbins Personal Power, Getting the Edge, Awaken The Giant because you must articulate what you want in the Universe. What if money is similar to the concept of the Matrix? What if the difference between me and John D. Rockefeller is a Universal expression of my potential in material manifestation?  Visulaization, understanding what money is, howto use it, how to grow, what real estate is, learning to think.<BR>I think I will end this lifetime as affluent.  Why? because not only have I maintained studying these kinds of books but because my video \\"games\\" are HSX.com, Entrepreneur PC game. I think that Kiyosaki SHOULDN\\"T answer questions such as numbers of what to do or how to do because life isn't about hand holding in the concept that people want it to be and honestly every person is different in terms of commitment level and ability. Did Obi Wan teach Luke how to transcend death or lift an X Wing fighter the first time? No. <BR>You have to understand business, law, taxes.  Really considering my investment future, what to do with money I may receive NEXT year in my tax returns, looking at my 401k plans and realizing that I could invest the money better, avoiding mutual funds and then designing an exit strategy for invested money---a concept pushed from the get go in RDPD----Enter Strategies, How Much You Need For the Lifestyle You Want and Exit Strategies. <BR>Thinking ahead.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Anyone who doesn't like this record obviously has no real taste in music.  I think it is safe to say this is an instant classic.  The whole album is full of great songs that never fail to amaze me with either there direct, melodic, and brutal approach or their really soft and melodic approach.  We won't hear a better record all year people and I think most of you know that.  When you make a record that reminds you of so many other forms of great rock music without being completely derivative than you know you have made something special.  Jack White is simply one of the most talented songwriters out there and the fact that he and Meg were able to distort that Bacharach cover into what it became just shows how special they actually are.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is about this lazy spoiled ten year old Chihiro and how she copes with good and evil in a spirit world different from ours. Her family for some reason decide to move, as they drive to their new home her dad ends up taking a short cut!Opps! Chihiro and her parents end up finding an abandon amusment park as they explore this world Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs because they ate food that was for the gods of the spirit world. Haku, a mysterious boy helps Chihiro to find work at the bath house the only place that Chihiro can find safety from the selfish witch Yu-Baba. I have watch this DVD like 3 times and havn't gotten sick of it, the characters Miyazaki creates are just so lovable and fun! My favorite is Haku and Chihiro. The graphics and background art is too cool and it really catches your eyes! Okay even though the voices are a little too disney for some I like them, they did good anyway. Spirited Away is PG meaning your child, for this particular movie might want to be 9 or older since the scary moments are tense and graphic. Alright I'll say since no one else did. Parents Spirited away is a Japanese anime, a type of advance cartoon with cpmlex events, plots and characters. These are different from disney movies in many ways... Spirited Away does have animated blood and gross moments but these all happen fairly qickly I'm saying this since I don't want other parents to hack or chop this film up just because it scared their kid. PG now adays just isn't the same maybe they would pefer Kiki's Delivery service(My personal fave.) or Castle in the sky if you still want to introduce them into anime. Anyway great movie for those that are going to be 10 and those who use to be 10.

B00006RU5B|5.0|I was skeptical about buying this album because of all the  hype surrounding it but, this album is totally worth all the raves it has been getting. What more can you expect from two superbands coming together. I even went to a see them live and they were awesome. Chris does performs &quot;I am the Highway&quot; accapella and then the band comes in....excellent. They are touring Lollapalooza, and it is worth it to go just to hear them. Buy this album...it is one of the ultimate albums.
6305075492|4.0|I am not sure if many people realize this, but this movies concept and look was reproduced in the film version of anne rice's Queen of the Damned. This is a gothic masterpiece It was reinvented to give life to The Vampire Lesatat's music video Forsaken. I saw this silent horror film recently with a friend and thought this is really gothic and dark.It really made a great music video! I liked the way everything was craw like very cool. I would really like to find the movie poster to the film and have it hanginging over my bed. That would be awesome. Great movie for that era.
0385721234|4.0|Like Water for Chocolate was an amazing story of love and triumph.  A teenage girl lives a life full of all kinds of powerful experiences which she comes about because all of her different emotions.  The girl, Tita, learns that she is forced to live an unmarried life in order to take care of her mother. When her mother realizes that Tita shows affection towards Pedro, Tita's one true love, the mother marries him off to Tita's older sister.  This creates a very difficult situation for the rest of Tita's life.<BR>  Tita is also the head cook of the household.  Through her cooking, which is vibrant and glowing with emotion, she spills her feelings of longing, frustration, rebellion, and love.  Good, bad, loving, or sad Tita's feelings are so powerful that it affected everyone who smelled, touched, and tasted her wonderful food. <BR> This makes for an interesting and fascinating story which is written in an incredibly unique, simple style.  Like Water for Chocolate made me respect the different types of love in one's life.  Even with all of the difficult events in her life, Tita found her true love.  I admired her because she always had and showed love for other people which sometimes kept her from making decisions that were in her best interest.  I recommend this book because it's a different type of love story which anyone can relate to.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I bought this CD when it came out in 1998.  Now, 5 years later, I can honestly say, it's still a regular in the rotation in my stereo.  It's classic... it will probably still be a favorite 20 years from now.<br />Lauryn has such a soulful, disctinct, beautiful voice.. it's flawless, just like this album.  Obviously there are some songs I like more than others, but I could easily listen to the CD without hitting the skip button.  My personal picks: Ex-Factor, Nothing Even Matters and Tell Him, a hidden track.  The songs she released to the radio, (Everything Is Everything, Doo Wop (That Thing), are great to listen to, as well.  But I think she really shines on the slow-tempo songs.  Just my opinion, though.. I'll let you be the judge.
0451204530|5.0|The title of the book that I am reviewing is \\"Code To Zero,\\" by Ken Follett. This is one of my favorite books. It is a mystery/suspense story. The main character is a guy named Luke and the supporting characters are Anthony, Billie, and Elspeth. There are a few more characters, but they're not very important so I won't name them. The story takes place in several different places. The year is 1958, but there are a lot of flash-backs, so it's kind of hard to keep up with the story. The Cold War is just ending and America is still in the space race with Russia. NASA keeps delaying the launching of the Explorer 1 because of weather conditions. But, the real reason is because there was word of a soviet spies who plan on sabotaging the launch of the rocket.<BR> The soviet spies found a way to destroy the Explorer 1 before it can exit the earth's atmosphere. If they succeed they can stop America's last chance to beat the Russian's and win the space race. There are only two people who know what is going on and can put a stop to it. Luke, the main character, is a who just wants to know the truth. In the beginning of the story, Luke wakes up in the men's-room of a subway with no memory of his past. He doesn't even know his own name. He's dressed like a bum so he automatically guesses that he is a hobo and drank all of his memory away. But, later in the book he finds out that he is really a rocket scientist and somebody deliberately erased his memory because he knew some very valuable information. With the knowledge he had, he could guarantee the outcome of the space race. <BR>Anthony was Luke's best friend in collage until he switched sides. Now, his mission in life is to stop America from beating Russia in the space race and making sure that Luke dose not interfere. His causes are really unknown so I'll just call him a traitor. Billie is helping Luke get his memory back and stop Anthony. She is also in love with Luke, but you will find out more about that if you ever read the book. Elspeth is Luke's wife, but there is more to her than there may seem. To bad telling you that would ruin most of the story for you. This is a great book with lots of action and suspense. But, even it has some cons. The beginning of the book is kind of slow and there are a few pauses in the middle, but that just builds it up for more action and suspense. If you don't mind those small flaws then you will love \\"Code To Zero\\".
0312954468|5.0|Set in the land of ancient Egypt (before the New Age, I guess), this book tells the touching story of a pair of star-crossed lovers from a slave's point of view. During the time of the story, Egypt is split in half - the Upper and Lower Egypt. Upper Egpyt is suffering from a weak pharaoh (whom historical records don't mention), an ambitious politican, and an unruly pack of brigands, which threaten to overturn the order of civilization. Only one man stands out to defend Egypt from the eminent danger - Tanus, Lord Harrab. Told in first-person narrative by his friend Taita the slave (whose intelligence seems quite a bit unbelievable), the story tells how Tanus falls in love with Lady Lostris (daughter of his father's deadliest enemy - who will also become the queen of Egypt) and saves the kingdom from destruction of the unruly bandits. However, the story isn't over yet. Just when Upper Egypt is rejoicing at the downfall of the brigands, a new danger descends upon Egypt - the Hyksos - with advanced weaponry and horse-drawn chariots. The entire history of Egypt is thus changed forever... (for more information - read the book!) Moving, action-packed, and filled with romance and intrigue, \\"River God\\" is worth the time reading. Although I must admit sometimes the situations seem unrealistic (the history is quite off-balanced too), the plot is breathtaking and full of surprises.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|It has been a long time since any new Fleetwood Mac music.  They wet our whistles with THE DANCE, and those of us who were waiting for this reunion album knew it would only be a matter of time.  And now we have Say You Will.  <BR>I Do love this album. REALLY!<BR>HOWEVER... some critques.<BR>a) at times, this album seems like a BUCKINGHAM/NICKS album.  Out of the 18 songs, Mick and John had a hand in writing....none.<BR>Other than playing on the all the tracks, there are moments that I got lost in either Stevie or Lindseys's songs, forgetting that this was a Fleetwood Mac album.  That's not a BAD thing, but it does need to be pointed out.<BR>b) the lack of Christine, who has opted out, does leave a hole.  Now, with only Stevie singing in her mystical way and Lindsay in his Hard Driving Rocker way, there is no balance.  Christine, we miss you<BR>These two points aside, This Album Does capture the soul and spirit that we have always associated with this incarnation of Fleetwood Mac and makes the passing years well worth the wait.<BR>If you only know Fleetwood Mac from Rumours, you need to check this one out.  <BR>If you know Fleetwood Mac from all their albums, add this one to your collection.<BR>If you know only Stevie Nicks or Lindsey Buckingham as a solo artist, this will help you discover their talent as a part of one of Rock'n Roll's greatest bands.<BR>Whatever reason you want for getting this, GET IT.  After one listen through, you will want to permanently add this to your cd player<br />PEACE<BR>scotty
B00008CLOA|5.0|Quite simply the best rock album of all time. I just do not care that it was a quasi concept album. Waters and Gilmour took us to places where we had never been. Nothing they did before or after quite measured up to this album, although some of their other offerings (Wish You Were Here, and the Wall) are in my top 25 of all-time. My suggestion is to put this CD into your player, turn the lights off or way down, put on the headphones (the best you can afford), get horizontal and press play. Wow is too small a word!
0767019954|5.0|This miniseries is outstanding in every way, from its faithful adaptation of Thackeray's novel, lovely settings, costumes, music, well-cast, well-portrayed multi-dimensional characters, and overall tone captures the spirit of the time (from the late 1790s, the emphasis on the Hundred Days just before Waterloo, to 1825). I particularly like how well the actors (Natasha Little, Tom Ward, Frances Grey, Philip Glenister, Nathaniel Parker, Miriam Margoyles, et al.) portray their characters. Natasha Little captures the spirit of Becky Sharp so well that viewers will both love her and hate her at the same time. The other characters are also very human, have strengths and weaknesses, but most lack morals, and have no qualms when it comes to cheating (whether at cards or with another man's wife), lying, using someone else to get ahead. <BR>I also like how well the miniseries shows the fancy dress ball held the evening before the battle of Waterloo and the horrors of the battle the following day. It makes the idea of war and death seem so incredibly far-off, almost unreal, as if it could not possibly happen to any of those officers. <BR>The miniseries does a nice job dealing with the class system in regency Britain, how it determines whom one marries, with whom one socializes, whether one has to work or not, and many of the uglier sides to it as well. For example, George Osborne's father wanted George to marry a sugar heiress from the Caribbean not because of her social standing but because the family needed her 10,000 per year. He commands his son to marry her, and, when George refuses, he promptly disowns him, cutting him off without a penny. (Not that George is such a great person-he is selfish, cold-hearted towards Amelia, and refuses to take responsibility for his actions.) Becky is looked down upon and not thought good enough because she is only a governess. Becky shows no qualms about cheating and stealing to get ahead, but still shows promise as a human being when shegives Amelia proof of George's planned infidelity, thus allowing Amelia to go on with her life. Miss Crawley is toadied to so long as she has money, and she expects to be obeyed because of it and her social standing. Amelia (Sedley) Osborne fares only a little better, but she too is naive, refusing to see her husband for the cad he really is, and continues to worship him even after his death despite the very real love offered to her by Dobbin. It is only after Becky, by giving her the letter from George asking Becky to run away with him the evening before Waterloo, does Amelia finally realize the truth about George and lets go of his memory.  The class system even permeates the army at this time. George Osborne is a captain by purchase, i.e., his father bought his commission. This was the way men became officers at the time, rather than being promoted from the ranks or because of intelligence or bravery in battle. The aristocracy (usually younger sons who often had no expectation of inheriting the family estate) went into the army in this manner. Social class and the amount of money one's father was willing to pay determined the officer's rank--the higher the rank the more expensive the commission--rather than merit. <BR>Very enjoyable and highly recommended.
B00008JLKL|4.0|The third CD from eRa provides no drastic changes than previous offering. Their first album was a major hit as one of their songs was featured in the 1998 WorldCup Soccer for MasterCard. The ad and the music it featured was so big, it made people think who was responsible behind the music showcased.<br />Their second CD was not that great. Something that sounded as going the same path where Enigma headed after the success of their first couple of CDs. i was surprised that eRa released their third album. That could only have meant one thing. People out there were still interested and still buying their work. This album, though very similar to the first two is also a bit different. More vocals are featured here, and I have to admit these vocals work in that sense. In Enigma, the vocals were either of a nymphomaniac or a guy screaming his head off because of something or the other.<br />The best example of this alluring voice is heard in \\"Don't U Forget About Me\\". A poignant story about childhood friendship and how the times can change people. Most of the other work in the album is then remixed versions of old material, something that Enigma used to do with success, up to a point that is. Carl Orff's O Fortuna here is another clear cut Enigma move. Though the people of eRa decided to make a video out of it.<br />If there ever will be a fourth eRa CD, I think that the composer of these songs, think twice before adding new versions of old songs. People would like to hear Ameno, but just not in every album by the same artist. The good thing about this CD is that it's not too long. Though it's an import, the price can tend to be a bit steep (I bought this here in the UAE, so it's not technically an import for us).<br />If you have the time, listen to this CD, but don't steal from your grandma's welfare check to buy it though. It's not worth the killing and the guilt.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I won't go into the story or plot as others here have done it so well. <br />With the exception of Princess Mononoke this is the best animated movie I've ever seen. Aside from the most beautifully drawn animation and a great imagination, this movie is free of the schmaltz, sentimentality and ram down your throat morality that most US animated movies have. The morality is there in buckets but it's so subtle that it sneaks up on you from behind. There are no good or evil characters in this movie. Most have a good and bad side to them. To me this is a far better way of explaining to kids the real world out there than the black & white mentality that most US movies portray. Most kids' movies I've seen talk down to kids. Miyazaki's movies tell stories that kids understand at their own level, whether they're 10, 15, 25 or 80.<br />Whilst I'm in total praise of the Japanese movie, the US DVD does have its faults. The American dubbing is truly awful to my English ears and I can only watch it in its Japanese/English subtitled version. They tried far too hard to make it sound 'natural' to American kids but everything about the movie screams 'Japanese' so why bother to go to all that effort! Another minus was that I had two copies of the DVD version seriously skip on two different players. <br />If I were giving stars for the original Japanese movie, I have to give it 5. The DVD however could have been a lot better. The US dubbed version knocks at least a star off it and two dodgy DVD's out of three isn't good for the physical media.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I was SOOOO excited for this album to come out that I quietly left work at 9am on Tuesday just to sneak over to the local music store and pick up a copy of the \\"Limited Edition\\" right when it went on sale.  I didn't much like \\"Die Another Day,\\" but some of the \\"American Life\\" remixes were fly, and the (now banned) video was truly inspiring.  <br />That said, this album is truly disappointing.  Musically, it definitely pushes forward but not really in any new or interesting ways.  This is almost \\"Music\\" the b-sides. The retro-eighties voicecoder thing is about played out.  And the whole introspective thing is good if you actually have something to say besides \\"I know I can feel bad/When I get in a bad mood.\\"  Is that supposed to be deep?<br />Lyrically the album is downright ridiculous.  Madonna needs a co-lyrisist \\"bad\\" and that makes me \\"sad\\" because I've been a Cinccone youth for twenty years.  Madonna may have \\"just realised that nothing/Is what it seems,\\" but that's hardly news to anyone living in the real world.  Madonna is out of touch, which is sad, because she used to be so inspiring.  Now, instead of inspiring strength and self-expression, she expects us to bob our heads and sing along to \\"I'm so stupid\\"?  No thank you.<br />Toward the end of the album Madonna sings, \\"I've got to give it up.\\"  Maybe it this instance Madonna is finally being insightful.
B0000399WI|5.0|Not only the #2 ranked movie of all time on [movie sites], but here on Amazon.com, at the time of this posting, 523 of 582 reviews awarded this film five stars, the highest possible.  Most of the remaining 59 reviews give it four stars.  If that's not a motivation to see this movie, nothing is.<br />The Shawshank Redemption is on my personal top ten \\"all-time\\" list, and is easily the finest adaptation of any Stephen King story.  I've read many of his books, but after reading Pet Sematary and It, I was left slack-jawed.  The man can flat-out write.  He has a gift... creating characters so real and alive you can sense them, and creating mood and tone so deeply real, it's palpable.  However, his stories oftentimes don't translate well to the screen.  Some things are better left in the imagination of the reader.  Happily, that wasn't the case with The Shawshank Redemption.  Amazing to me was that this nearly two-and-a-half hour movie was pulled from the text of a story scarcely a hundred pages in length (in a small paperback, no less).  That alone is testament to the depth and power of King's story, in my opinion.<br />The filmmakers did a masterful job of handling the passage of time that is a crucial element to this story -- both linear time and flashbacks.  It was seamless and could scarcely have been done any better.  The casting was spot-on.  Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton (as Warden Norton), and Clancy Brown (as Byron Hadley) were standouts.<br />The few departures from the text of King's story were actually very welcome.  It was much more visceral for Tommy to be shot than for him to be transferred to another prison, just as it was much more satisfying for Norton to kill himself than to be hauled away to jail.  Some of the violence was difficult to watch, but, after all, this story takes place primarily within the walls of a maximum security state prison.  It can't be whitewashed without diluting the impact of the overall story.<br />This movie found newlife after its release on home video, this much is certain.  It didn't curry much favor with moviegoers during its theater run; many said the cumbersome title was partly to blame.  Some said it was too long a movie.  Others speculated the nature of the film (prison drama) was its main detraction.  Perhaps, too, it was just the competition (the same year also saw Pulp Fiction, The Lion King, Forrest Gump, The Client, and more).  Whatever the reason, this movie was clearly one of the most underrated of all time.  Only in its home video run did it achieve the full status and appreciation it so richly deserved.  Although politics have robbed many worthy films of proper \\"Best Picture\\" Oscars, in this case, The Shawshank Redemption was just outmatched by a film which was not only excellent in its own right, but exponentially more popular at the box office: Forrest Gump.  However, to have had seven Oscar nominations and win nary a one was a travesty.  Nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor (Morgan Freeman), Best Cinematography, Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, and Best Original Music Score, it should have at least won the award for Best Screenplay Adaptation... and possibly Best Film Editing as well.  Forrest Gump was simply the Titanic of 1994, and swept the Oscars that year.<br />If you've not availed yourself the experience of seeing this fine film, find a way to make it happen.  It's an affirming human drama that will stay with you long after the movie's credits have rolled.  For those not fortunate enough to have read the source material, either, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Stephen King's 1982 book Different Seasons.  \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" is the first story.  A quick read of this short story will give clear understanding of why someone read this tale and thought, \\"This would make a fantastic movie!\\"
B000089A07|2.0|Red Dragon is a terrible, formulaic flick with good actors but nauseating writing.<br />Not only are almost all events and details plot devices (oh, how I dream of a day of character development without excessive leveraging for plot line) but they aren't really interesting.  Imagery is not great (I had AT LEAST expected good imagery) and I was not put on the edge of my feet.  The clincher at the end was not fun, exciting, or creative.  Only watch this movie if you have to watch your favorite actors in action (and don't expect all that much action). -K
B0000640VO|5.0|A very sweet soft and fresh movie, about a French spirit we tend to forget too much nowadays.<BR>It will shine your day!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I like to think that every movie can be rated five stars as long as you're the focus group for the movie.  For instance, Jackass gets five stars if a good time is hanging out with friends pulling pranks on each other, and one star if you're any of the women on \\"The View.\\"  <BR>Zoolander will easily fall into the five star catagory for you as long as you're 1, a person who loves quoting movies, and 2, intellegent.  Not to be rude, but let's face it.  Most of the people who hate this movie don't know what a spider monkey is, and therefore don't get it.  <BR>As for the movie itself, it wasn't what I expected.  It was something totally different, above, and beyond those expectations.  After \\"There's Something About Mary,\\" I was expecting typical gross out humor, but was surprised at how many subtle jokes emerge every time I watch it.  Owen Wilson is absolutely hilarious as Hansel.  Carefully listen to his lines since so many jokes are hidden in quick dialog that most people don't catch it.  <BR>In the end this movie might not ever gross as much money as \\"There's Something About Mary,\\" and it shouldn't be expected to.  That was a decent movie too, but Zoolander had to rely on it's jokes to pass as a good movie.  Not just Cameron Diaz prancing around without a bra on the whole movie.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I was expecting a return to form with Iron Maiden's 2000 release, Brave New World. Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith had re-joined the band and it seemed the band was refocused and ready to put their generally sub-par 90s sound behind them.<br />Even as a die-hard fan, I wasn't expecting an album like this. <br />This album easily ranks as one of Maiden's top three albums and anyone who owns their string of albums from 1983 through 1988 knows what a statement that is. This album has everything that makes great music; excellent songwriting, excellent performances and excellent production. Bruce Dickinson turns in one of his greatest performances, singing with power and passion. Nicko McBrain's drumwork is crystal clear. The three guitar line-up is heavy but not clumsy and Steve Harris anchors it all with some outstanding bass playing. <br />Brave New World's sound is classic Iron Maiden, with some modern elements thrown in. The lyrics are a lot more introspective and poetic compared to some of the cheese Maiden's served up in the past (\\"Quest for Fire\\", anyone?) Songs like \\"Dream of Mirrors\\" and the title track are powerful and relavent. \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\" is one of Maiden's best songs ever. The whole album shines.<br />3 years later and this CD is still in my play rotation, because it never left. It's an amazing accomplishment and a real treat for fans of classic metal. There are very few bodies of music that have moved me like Brave New World has.
B00005QXDD|4.0|Tenacious D is hilarious.  Their skits are really funny, as are their songs.  Each skit is great: not one misses the mark and they also are nice and short: not too much commitment, which means you can listen to each skit that much more.  From &quot;Inward Singing&quot; to &quot;One Not Song&quot; this album will have you peeing in your pants...while singing!<br />And the best part about Tenacious D?  They are talented musicians.  The songs often have really cool guitar parts.  As many people have stated, they could definetly pass as a rock group.  <br />The vocals.  Wow.  Jack Black has, jokes aside, one of the best rock voices I've ever heard.  He sounds great.  And the harmonies, like on &quot;Tribute&quot; and &quot;Wonderboy&quot; sound awesome (both are awesome songs too).<br />Lastly, the only bad thing about this CD are one or two tracks that don't last the test of time.  &quot;Lee&quot; and &quot;Explosivo&quot; being two prominent offenders, but they're still decent.<br />The comedy draws you to this album, and the music keeps you there.
B000065U1N|5.0|The title sums it up best. A very realstic account of the war in Somalia and of war in general. Hits close to home in today's current war, and brings into life what many people do for America and for the freedom they fight for. Almost to realistic in parts.
0316921173|5.0|My favorite book ever, bar none.  But don't take my word for it - go to the message board at the Howling Fantods website and get a feel for the number of readers that are reading this mammoth thing for a second or third time; it's either because this book is *that* good (it is) or Wallace's readers are an addicted lot (they are).<br />Also, a tip:  read Neal Stephenson's 'Cryptonomicon' if you haven't - a no less compulsively readable book of similar length.
B000089CPF|1.0|I have all the Calexico recordings-this one sounds to me like it is merely filler that did not make it onto other records.  Moreover, Joey Burns sounds like he is actually trying to \\"sing\\" which makes him sound inappropriate-before, his world-weary voice sounded right for the music, now he sounds like he wants to be some country and western star.  It's not good. I hate it compared to \\"Spoke.\\"  And I wish they would lose the mariachi [stuff] and do meaningful stuff they can repeat live.  This \\"band\\" which is most oftentimes only two people, doesn't sound like this live.  And I've seen them several times.  I'd like to see the mariachi players, the vibraphonists, the string players, bass, piano, whatever else they have on their records repeated live.  Maybe they save that for special performances or their European tours.  Who knows.  But for steadfast Calexico fans you'll probably just be a little disappointed if you notice these things at all.  Oh, and that cover illustration is just, I don't know, kind of stupid and annoying.  Like most Calexico illustrations, it has little to do with the record.  But this one is especially annoying because it's just boring, stupid and ridiculous because it shows some girl sitting on her skateboard.<BR>The artist's rendition is ok, but what is Calexico trying to say here, that they're cool and can relate to the skate scene?  This is just hopelessly sad.
B000002INJ|4.0|While rumaging through the CD's at my local Used CD store, my eyes fell upon a used copy of Kings Of Metal. I quickly picked it up. The album just blew me awy. Sure Manowar my be a little oon the cheesy side with their ourtagous costumes and unique lyrics, but their music is fun and fast. It was a nice change from listening to all the nu-metal withieir their moaning aobut how bad their life is and how society [messed] them up. Manowar is totally different. Manowar seems to be happy their metal artisits and they love to show it with their music. Belive it or not,, Manowar can be seen as an uplifting Metal group. KINGS OF METAL is so much fun. The album can make you feel aggressive and as well as make you laugh. It's a joy ride all the way through. The instrumental Sting of the Bumblebee was a real treat. Soon after my experience with Kings of Metal. I went of and bought Warriors of the World and was equally blown away. So if your sick of all the nu-metal groups complaing about their so called \\"bad\\" lives, give Manowar a try, they just may surprise you! MANOWAR, THE KINGS OF METAL!
B000001FAW|5.0|I recently purchased this CD and I love it!  Only a couple of tracks on this album are well known.  But, it is still one of the best Bee Gees album I have heard.  I especially love Maurice's lead vocals on \\"Boogie Child\\".  This is fast becoming one of my very all-time favorites.  And the harmony on \\"Children of the World\\" is wonderful.<br />I think that anyone who likes the voices of Barry, Robin and Maurice will enjoy this album.
B000001OAA|4.0|Garbage's eponymous debut is a must-have for all fans, current or prospective. I picked up \\"Garbage\\" along with \\"Version 2.0\\" purely on a whim, and soon became one of those obsessive fans you tend to hear about but rarely meet. While \\"Garbage\\" isn't their best album, in my opinion (that would be \\"Version 2.0\\" - if you don't have it, buy it NOW), \\"Garbage\\" is still an excellent buy. <br />Garbage created a truly unique fusion of electronica, grunge, and alt-rock with this album, and the sonic alchemy within warrants at least a casual listen. But there isn't just mindless musical experimentation going on here - the songs are fantastic, with few missteps. The two best tracks, \\"Stupid Girl\\" and \\"Queer\\" (both hit singles), showcase Garbage's skill with making rounded-out, kick-butt songs and leaving the listener wanting more. But the rest of the album is no worse: \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" is a lean and mean rock ride, \\"As Heaven Is Wide\\" has a unique, quietly menacing electronic edge, and \\"My Lover's Box\\" starts of slow and then grows to an incredible crescendo - in the space of two seconds, the volume of the song shoots into the upper stratosphere. (Try it with a huge subwoofer - it's fun.) The entire album is filled with ingenious hooks, throbbing beats, and suprisingly mellow breaks in between. While not every track is a winner - \\"Not My Idea\\" and \\"Dog New Tricks\\" stand out as being relatively weak - the package as a whole is coherent and enjoyable. If you're an alt-rock fan, \\"Garbage\\" is a must; if you're a fan of music in general, \\"Garbage\\" is more than worth the price of admission.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I'm just a big 'ole kid at heart, but even adults will love this movie.  There are silly things (like farts and boogers) that the kids will love.  Then there are the innuendos that the adults will find hilarious.  It's also a spoof on a lot of the fairy tales that we know and love.  Besides, how can you not find the name of the short prince &quot;Lord Faquod&quot; funny?  Come on!  I could watch this movie over and over again.  Great!  Combining the comic genius of Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy into one movie was a wonderful move and made for a great movie.  I would recommend this to children and adults of all ages.
B00006RIO7|5.0|If not better than the fabulous movie....b/c it comes with so much more than was included in the film!  I love the jazz of that era, and the CD has quite a few jazz extras.<br />If you liked the movie, you'll LOVE the soundtrack.  I haven't stopped listening to it for days!
B00005LKHW|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies that I've EVER seen.  It totally put me in the mind of a high school boy...which is one thing I've never been!  It took me back to those high school days and just made me laugh until I cried.  The sequel was just as good...if not better.  SEE THIS MOVIE!<br />On this unrated version I wasn't quite sure what the difference was from the one I saw in the theater.  Jason Biggs gets caught in a different compromising position with the pie (a little more down and dirty) but that might have been it.  I don't think there was any extra nudity, though.  Just a little confused on that issue...but the movie is still wonderful.
B00005JKZV|4.0|After seeing the Fellowship of the Rings, I couldn't wait for Two Towers to come out, and was pleasantly pleased when our local cinema decided to show the first movie (7 pm) followed by the Two Towers at midnight. <br />The movie itself is overwhelming. Like the first one, the viewer is bombarded with gorgeous scenery, beautifully constructed costumes, amazing CGI (at times you cannot tell the difference between what's real and what's not), and a story that will keep you at the edge of your seat for nearly three hours.<br />The story picks up where the first one left. In short: Merry and Pippin got abducted by Saruman's Uruk-Hai Orcs. Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are in close pursuit to try and free them, while Frodo and Sam make their way into the land of Mordor, after a while being escorted by the creature Gollum.<br />The book is (again) closely followed, but not too closely for my liking. Peter Jackson strayed from the original storyline at a few points, but personally, I fail to see why. <br />For instance, there's a little substory in which Arwen decides (or is forced) to leave for the Grey Shores. This was unneccessary, and the way in which she is shown to be departing is just painfull, and unworthy of her character. I'm sure it will be fixed in the third movie, but still. Why not stick to the book?<br />Same thing with Aragorn falling down a cliff. It doesn't really add anything to the story, and it would have been just as easy to follow the book.<br />Worse is when Jackson actually makes Frodo being abducted by Faramir. In the book, Faramir is a very noble man, who releases Frodo almost straight away. In the movie, he's more made out like a rogue who wants to hand Frodo over to his father, for personal gain. And Frodo showing the ring to the Nazgul is just plain outrageous. <br />Another little peeve I had was that for an hour and a half, the battle at Helm's Deep is prepared. You see armies marching, defenses being built up, and for an hour and a half, you're kept at the very edge of your seat. <br />And then within 5 minutes or so, everything is over. The long build-up (which was done extremely well) just ends like that. Jackson could have taken a few more minutes to make it just a tad more spectacular than it turned out.<br />All in all, still 4 stars, as Jackson DOES correct his 'straying' by the end of the movie, and being carried off to Middle Earth to see all your favourite characters in their natural surroundings is just as wonderfull as it was the very first time.<br />I'm anxiously awaiting the Return of the King!
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna's voice is warm and rich; I love it more than ever, but concede that there is no longer any joy in her music. For instance, with \\"Mother and Father,\\" she and Mirwais construe a fantastic beat, but the song is only one big piece of humorless irony, given its lyrics. And by track 9 of this album, we're in need of some humor, and it'd be nice to have actual permission to dance.<br />Life's like this: each of us is on a spiritual quest, and each of us is always in the process of change. Who has not made mistakes, or questioned past actions and values? There are many dark times that we endure, many days where there ain't no joy. And of course great art reflects these concerns, but not in ways that leave us feeling only melancholy-- and melancholy is pretty much all we feel by the time we're done listening to a song like \\"Easy Ride.\\" <br />Tellingly, in \\"Love Profusion,\\" Madonna sings, \\"What I want is a celebration.\\" Considering that we're told in the same song that \\"There is no consolation,\\" it's reasonable to ask, \\"A celebration of what, then?\\" Although Madonna has often been familiar with things sad and perspectives pensive, on each of her former albums she found things to... well, actually celebrate. For instance, \\"Erotica,\\" which Camille Paglia called a work of \\"dark beauty,\\" had \\"Where Life Begins\\" and \\"Deeper and Deeper;\\" \\"Like a Prayer\\" christened \\"Cherish\\" and \\"Dear Jessie\\" alongside \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"Till Death do us Part.\\" Unfortunately, as in the final line of the chorus of \\"Intervention,\\" much of the music on \\"American Life\\" points us only to escape and oblivion.<br />When I'm think that life is nothing but misery, I find it heartening to remember a song like \\"Angel,\\" where \\"sadness disappears/ Every time you are near.\\" With that song, Madonna made something paradoxically heartbreaking and joyful. She made you feel as though you were dancing on air. And nothing will convince me that anything on \\"American Life\\" is more beautiful or of deeper import thanan old tune like that.
0792798619|5.0|If there was a way to go over the 5 stars I'd definately do it!  Linda Howard has a way with a scene weither it be murder and mayhem or pure unadulterated sex!  And she makes you ejoy them both!  I recommend all her books.  This is one of the ones I read over and over again, and even though I know what's going to happen I'm at the edge of my seat.  I'm happy to say I've turned a few of my friends on to her books and they are truly happy I've done so!
6305882592|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  It is funny, disturbing, and enlightening at the same time.  I'm 18, and in a world were many movies targeted towards teen have no substance, Harold and Maude is truely refreshing.  The soudtrack is also great!
B000002KDS|5.0|The Alice Cooper Group will forever be known for \\"School's Out\\", \\"No More Mr. Nice Guy\\", and \\"I'm Eighteen.\\"  There are no \\"classics\\" from this album, but most hardcore fans agree that this is one of the best(if not THE best) album the band has put out.  There may be no hit singles, but the album is very solid throughout with no bad tracks.  It was released the same year as \\"Love It To Death\\", and can basically be seen as side two to that album.  It's very wild and hard rockin' for the time, and you can certainly see why many parents thought that the only good Alice Cooper was a dead one.  Even if Alice Cooper doesn't quite tickle your fancy, you should give this album a shot if you have an interest in classic rock or hard rock in general.  If you've wondered what the \\"deal\\" is with Alice Cooper, this album should answer some of your questions without a doubt.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I guess you can buy good reviews and magazine covers! This album was not good or original or anything close to classic rock n roll. Take away the high dollar hype and let the youth of today see and hear this band as they really are and let them decide without being brainwashed. I think the reviews I read before purchasing this cd were written by the White Stripes` record company. One thing I will say, in there favor, is they do a good job at trying to masquerade as the Flat Duo Jets. I liked the first White Stripes Cd and if there are people out there looking for the roots of the White Stripes, then they should pick up a Flat Duo Jets CD or better yet, the latest by Dexter Romweber (he was the singer guitar player of the Jets) I heard his new Duo is playing shows with the White Stripes. I would love too see that.
B00008IAMD|5.0|WOW! What an amazing album by a legend of country music. In a day and time where country music can be defined as anything, Johnny Cash gives us the best one....the right one! This is truly a man with staying power in an industry that spawns tons of sell outs everyday. Johnny Cash stays true to himself and his music and still sells records. I think this is a great album and it deserves all the awards it may get.This is the first time ever I have bought a country album and I am thouroughly impressed.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This album's raw guitar sound makes your speakers feel like the direct extension of the guitar's amp. There's a rough feeling to it, just like a live performance. Coupled with what could only be described as raw lyrics and a raw production, this album leaves you wondering where was this music hiding through all these years.<BR>Songs like &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine&quot;, my personal favourite, will take you back to old Led Zeppelin days. Others, like &quot;Ball And Biscuit&quot;, offer basic and concentrated rhythm and blues. Together, they add up to create an excellent rock album.<BR>Indeed, it's been a long time since I rock and rolled, and it's been too long a time since someone did the Stroll like that.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park is an embarassment to every band they claim to be inspired by. Their rapping is pathetically substandard, even for white kids. Their electronic beats/synthlines are simplistic and formulaic. Their lyrics are self-indulgent whiney garbage remniscent of high school goth poetry. Maybe its just me, but there's nothing more annoying than faux-misery. Their sound is so overproduced and unchallenging... easily absorbed without a struggle or a brain cell utilized. The sung vocal lines remind me of any MTV happy boy band of your choosing. Basically a radio-friendly mish mash of popular genres glossed over with a pop shine aimed at pre-teens who don't know any better. But I guess what can you expect from a band that was signed to a major label after their first show.<br />Please people, stop listening to garbage like this. It makes the RIAA think you're stupid enough to keep buying this kind of tripe...
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I'm not a great Rock fan, but Fleetwood Mac has always had a special musical place in my heart and this album is terrific because everyone on it is an amazing musician, highly skilled and lover of his craft.<br />Lindsey Buckingham's way with a guitar is truly magical and if at first you think this album quite different from their others, you will find that it will grow on you very quickly.<br />I hope they don't wait long to make another one.<BR>Fleetwood Mac is fabulous.
0385484518|5.0|Mitch Albom hadn't spoken with Morrie in sixteen years, ever since Mitch graduated from Brandeis University in 1979.  He may have never gotten back in touch with his professor that he lovingly refers to as \\"Coach\\" if he hadn't been clicking through the channels one evening and seen Morrie being interviewed by Ted Koppel on \\"Nightline\\".  Tuesdays With Morrie:  an old man, a young man, and life's greatest lesson is an undeniably touching biography that leaves its readers dabbing their eyes with tissues and not only that, but grasping to read more about the incredible and unforgettable professor of Sociology, Morrie Schwartz, who never stopped learning or sharing his words of wisdom until the day he died.  <BR>          In his book, Albom gives good grounding so the readers know all about his own past, Morrie's past, and medical knowledge of the disease which has taken control of Morrie, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.  At times readers may feel that the details and analysis of Albom's own life aren't needed, but on the contrary, they give insight into the man who changed so much after being with his mentor and friend for only a few short months before Morrie's death.  <BR>          In the beginning of the book, Albom makes a promise that at the time, he intends to keep.  He writes that at his graduation ceremony in 1979, he presents Morrie with a briefcase in hopes that Morrie will never forget him and after a long hug, Morrie asks him if he will keep in touch.  Without hesitation Mitch says, \\"Of course.\\"  He does a horrible job of keeping that promise until almost twenty years later when mentor and student are reunited.  Mitch Albom tells readers truths about himself that most people would be too ashamed to divulge.  This gives readers something to relate to. Mitch becomes a sports reporter in Detroit and on ESPN and when his life gets difficult, his way of running away is to dive deeper into his work and focus on anythingbut the real problem at hand that he needs to deal with.  Too often people get preoccupied with making money and buying the newest and best products available, and we forget about the truly important people and things in our lives that have helped shape us.  Some of Morrie's aphorisms are \\"Devote yourself to others\\" and \\"Love always wins\\".  We all need to be reminded of these truths sometimes, and Morrie illuminates many of them in his weekly, tape-recorded sessions with Albom.   <BR>          Tuesdays With Morrie teaches the deeper meaning of life.  The book is structured in such a way that there is a chapter on all of one through fourteen weeks and then there is a flashback.  It could be of either Albom or Morrie's life.  These flashbacks explain pertinent information and are a wonderful way to engage the reader without giving too much unneeded information that could make the book go on much longer than it had too.  The 192-page hardback book is the perfect length book to give the reader just enough so that they don't need to ask for more because they feel as if they have closure at the end.  Yet this book is so easily understandable and heartfelt that the reader can't help but say, \\"Give me more!  Tell me more about this elderly man that has so much wisdom to offer.\\"<BR>          Each chapter, aside from flashbacks, is called \\"The (any number of one through fourteen) Tuesday\\" and then it goes on to explain the topic that will be discussed that day.  Some topics that they discuss in the book are the world, feeling sorry for yourself, regrets, death, family, emotions, the fear of aging, money, how love goes on, marriage, our culture, and forgiveness.  The book ends by painting a picture in the readers mind.  This is the same picture that was painted in the beginning almost word for word. <BR>          Albom writes:  \\"The last class of my old professor's life took place once a week, in his home, by a window in his study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink flowers.  The class met on Tuesdays.  No books were required.  The subject was the meaning of life.  It was taught from experience.  <BR>          \\"The teaching goes on.\\"  <BR>          There couldn't have been a better way for Albom to close the book.  This ending tells people that everyone can learn how to live their lives to the fullest right up until the end.  Morrie was learning new things about life and about himself all the way until the day he died.  We are just lucky enough to get to hear what he learned.  <BR>          Readers may be asking, \\"So what is life's greatest lesson?\\"  Albom says, \\"...if Professor Morrie Schwartz taught me anything at all, it was this: there is no such thing as \\"too late\\" in life.\\"  He also learned that \\"Death ends a life, not a relationship\\" so even after Morrie left this world, he would live on in the hearts of everyone he met, and in the readers of this book who felt as if they knew Morrie personally after reading the book.  <BR>          This well-organized chronicle of the last fourteen weeks Morrie Schwartz and Mitch Albom spent together, helps make a book of great clarity and wisdom.  The book is inspirational and sensitive and the life lessons learned in the book aren't easily forgotten.  This book is what the two men refer to as the final thesis of the class; the class that met once a week on Tuesdays.  This story is tragic, but well worth reading.  The excellence of the book can't be doubted when it has been embraced by readers around the world, being published in nineteen countries and in sixteen different languages.  Albom gives a tribute to a remarkable teacher in Tuesdays With Morrie.  If you want to learn the meaning of life, then this book is for you.
B000066NW0|4.0|Besides the hit single &quot;Complicated,&quot; this is a talented young lady. She has a beautiful voice, which is a rarity in Rock. The songs are great instead of the usual filler on CDs. I enjoyed this effort and look forward to hearing more from her.
B00006IRJU|4.0|Fantastic remaster!  Unfortunately, track 1 (Crazy) is the single version, which clocks in at about a minute shorter than the original album version.
B00005YW4H|1.0|I bought this CD expecting big things from Norah Jones. It is a boring CD. Except for the \\"Don't Know Why\\" track, the rest are a waste. If Jazz is your thing, you will like it. I could have bought the CD single instead for the one song. Don't waste your time! Stripped and Justified are better CDs!!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I like this movie very much and so does my 5 year-old daughter.  The animation is beautiful but it's the fresh ideas, concepts, and characters that impressed me the most.  The originality is staggering.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Ignore the video for Dirty and experience an excellent CD. Cristina's new effort is rich in emotion and musical excellence. The range of musical styles is a treat and her incredible voice proves she has what it takes to last in the business. Particular favorites are &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours,&quot; &quot;Impossible,&quot; and &quot;Beautiful.&quot; She sings to the heart and truth of life. Mariah could learn from this.
0393039102|5.0|This is a book that will move you.  Eric Lomax is a man of depth, intelligence and keen perception.  His writing is vivid, his story one that you can't put down.  I strongly urge anyone interested in what the POW experience is like, and anyone interested in a powerful story, to buy and read this book.
B00008S2VH|1.0|First of all I am a great Madonna fan, and have been for many years.  But I must be honest.  This is easily the most awful thing she has ever done.  That &quot;spark&quot; clearly evident on her other releases has disappeared.  <BR>There is nothing remotely interesting about this album.  There are no memorable melodies and the lyrics are plain terrible.  And what convinced Madonna she can rap!  I feel embarrased for her!  <BR>Mostly I wish she would stop rehashing old ideas and material.  It clearly shows a lack of vision.  We know your mother died when you were five, Madonna.  You've told us again and again.  GET OVER IT! She obviously realises there are always going to be fans out there who will buy her albums and give them 5 star ratings, regardless of how bad they are.  I should know.  I used to be a &quot;yes madonna&quot; fan.  <BR>Please take my advice.  Don't buy this tripe.  She doesn't deserve any more of our hard earned money.
B000089RVX|5.0|the intensity of garbage, and the etherial quality of enya.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I must say I agree very much with David:  This was a film written for the public at large, and not for the \\"Trekkie\\", as it were.  One thing that they could easily have played off of from the series was character of B4.  In the series episode titled \\"Inheritance\\", Data's mother did indeed hint that there were more androids like Data than just Lore.  But for a few words, this easily could have given more die-hard fans somthing of what they wanted; An obscure reference to the series.  I do disagree with some other critisims about Picard in the area of him becomming an action hero.  There were plenty of situations where Picard demonstrated his physical prowness in the series (rock climbing, bar fights, tactical training, and so on).  But I do agree on the point that the movie was too Picard centered.  To be fair, however, if the general story of the movie had been an episode in the series, I think it would have been remembered as one of the best episodes (along with Chain of Command, and All Good Things...).  I close by saying that I hope very much that this is not the final movie with this cast, as there are too many loose threads and unanswered questions.
0451527046|4.0|The story of Treasure Island takes place during the glorious 18th century, when seamen still sailed the oceans in search of wealth and fame. The most feared enemies were the sea pirates. Young Jim Hawkins discovers a treasure map in the sea-chest of the murdered pirate, Billy Bones. Jim joins Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney to form a partnership to search for buried pirate treasure. The presiding genius of their crew is the one-legged pirate turned sea cook, Long John Silver. Long John is cunning and bloodthirsty, without a shred of conscience. But his buoyant humour and vitality are irresistible. Their sea voyage turns out to become quite perilous when the first rumours of mutiny are being whispered on board of the Hispaniola.<br />The point about classics such as Treasure Island is that you cannot doubt the relevance of such a book, since it is still popular more than 120 years after it was first published (1883). Hundreds of books following Treasure Island have used the image of the pirate Long John Silver and made it a universal type. Ask anyone to picture a pirate and in nine out of ten cases you will get something closely resembling Long John.<br />The strongest quality of Treasure Island is that it is still surprisingly fresh. It has a pace that can stand comparison with any contemporary novel. Stevenson did not add a lot of moralising to the story, which is quite remarkable for a coming of age story dated from that period. The character of Long John suffers clearly from a certain machiavellian duality, a topic that will return more prominently in Stevenson's later work: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
0440133688|4.0|Recently while we were riding in the car together, my boyfriend was updating me on the condition of his sick grandfather.  The week before his grandpa had been hospitalized after a fall, but a CT scan showed an intestinal perforiation.  His condition was complicated by the fact that he suffered from diabetes and severe obesity after a lifetime of eating Wisconsin cheese and fried foods on the farm.  My boyfriend was upset because the operation had not gone well and the surgeons took hours longer than had been expected.   His grandfather was now in the burn unit of the hospital waiting a transfer to the regional medical center.  As soon as my boyfriend got this information out about the surgery I immediately started explaining how the surgeons probably had more infection to clean out of the abdomen then they had expected and how his grandfather was probably in the burn unit because the wound could not have been closed up very well on account of it being abdominal surgery that needs to drain, but also that with all of his grandpa's stomach fat it probably just did not close because it's impossible to stitch fat together . . .  Argh!  Awful, awful me!  Here my boyfriend is concerned about his grandfather's life, and I'm rambling on about what little I can guess about the surgery being the \\"knowledgeable\\" second year medical student that I am.  I didn't even ask how the poor old guy was doing.  And worse yet, I didn't realize what I was doing until my boyfriend interrupted me, \\"Elizabeth, enough!  My grandpa is not incisions that won't close or infection!  I can't believe you! You haven't even asked me how he's doing.  What are you learning in medical school?!\\"  <br />It is this moment in my life, being chastised by someone I love for not showing concern for a patient and his family, that really brought to life for me the book, The House of God.  It brought back memories of Berry's concern for Roy as he became unfeeling and emotionless towards the \\"gomers\\" that he caresfor.  The book really illustrated for me how becoming a physician is a process of socialization and so often we are trained out of being caring human beings and turned into analytical, procedure-loving robots, void of feelings or concern.  As someone who wants to go into family practice and deal with the \\"whole patient - mind, body, spirit\\" I never thought this desensitizing could happen to me - and yet unknowingly I may have lost touch with my nurturing and caring self (if only for a moment).<br />My only criticism about the book is that it only portrays the negative ways in which physicians try to cope with the stresses and insults that medicine deals out each day.  One doctor in the book is obsessive/compulsive about running, Roy seems to get his release from sexual exploits, and one young resident even kills himself.  While I certainly recognize that this can happen it left me wondering about what I may become and how I could \\"save myself\\" from this inevitable demise.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Although alot of these songs will never make regular airplay, I love this cd.  Mellow and introspective, Madonna reveals alot of herself in her lyrics, and her voice is lovely.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is the best piece of work she has ever produced. It's homogenous-sounding in terms of production, yet it is full a diversity in its song style. Her vocal is breathtakingly good. It is acoustic, yet electronic. It is '80s, yet very modern. It has taken 20-years for Madonna to create her finest work. There is not a bad song on it. The sound is very mature and there are so many different songs that every fan will find something they like.
B00005JKPF|4.0|Buoyed by the phenomenal success of X-Men, this sequel to the titular mutant heroes is surprisingly faithful to its source as an allegory. Director Bryan Singer reteams with his first ensemble of characters including  Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Storm (Halle Berry), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Cyclops (Marsden) and Jean Grey (Janssen) with nemesis Magneto (McKellen) and Mystique (Stamos) while building up the history of the compelling Wolverine (Jackman) and introducing teleportic Nightcrawler (Cummings) and menacing Lady Deathstryke (Kelly Hu) as the assistant to military general Stryker (Brian Cox) who plans to invoke the Anti-Mutant Registration Act and eliminate them. X-Men 2 establishes itself in full throttle with canted CGI-action scenes including the exciting escape from the X-Mansion as well as the climactic showdown at Alkali Lake. Singer deftly avoids overcrowding and sculpts each character with dimension and emotions while impresses upon audience with a portrait of misfits and xenophobic alienation, that gains renewed resonance with post-911 era. The struggle of good versus evil becomes increasingly blurred with Xavier and Magneto confronting the enemy with different intentions. X-Men 2 fuses comic fantasy with gripping characterization, particularly Jackman's anguished performance as Wolverine and McKellen's sardonic lines, that easily gives this thriller the definitive X-factor.

The cover is what initially caught my interest, and the blurb was sufficiently attractive, but I never expected this great a read.  I figured the book would be a quick, entertaining read, but I fell in love with the book about halfway through.  Gaiman's writing is so captivating to me, I can feel and understand every word uttered, and I enjoy it.  Soon enough, I found myself completely entwined in the story, feeling everything.  I often found a slight grin on my face, or a furrow in my brow, and that's what makes it all worth it.  I didn't feel the book was too short at all, (keeping in mind that one of my favourite books of late is House of Leaves, which is like 700+ pages in its twisted glory).  I think this is a great read for anyone, weather you are a first-time Gaiman reader or not.
0452282152|4.0|In The Girl With the Pearl Earring, the author uses a unique style to engage the reader.  Tracy Chevalier's descriptive passages bring to life the small town of Delft in the 1600s.  Griet, a new maid at the Vermeer's household paints a picture of the daily activities with an inside view into the life and times of the painter Vermeer.  The relationships that Griet has to those around her show the character of a poor family trying to make ends meet, and the importance of ones station in life.  Griet must choose between listening to her heart or to her duty as a daughter and a maid.  <BR> Griet grew up in a small family where her father was a tile painter, until an accident in the factory took away his sight.  Because of his inability to support his family, Griet must go and make money so her family can survive.  She leaves the protestant section of town she has always known, and goes to work and live in the catholic part of the town.  <BR> The Painter Vermeer's family is growing and they need someone to help with the household duties.  His wife, Catharina, is constantly pregnant, and very difficult for Griet to handle.  One of the daughters, Cornelia, is always stirring up trouble \\"When [Cornelia] appeared between the hanging clothes and looked down at me with a cruel smirk on her face, I wanted to slap her as I had that first day I had come to work at the house\\" (Chevalier 212).  She tries her hardest to get Griet in trouble, so Catharina is always watching her with a suspicious eye.  Griet must tread carefully so as not to anger anyone.  <BR> Vermeer is a quiet man, who has to deal with his families increasing size and the debt that comes with it.  For his family, it seems that he cannot paint fast enough.  He needs to finish paintings quickly to make money.  For himself, he cannot paint faster and still be satisfied with his handiwork.  He takes his time, to the disappointment of his wife.   Vermeer spends all of his time in his studio, creating his own world, andfew are privileged enough to share in it.  Griet would have to try hard not to get caught up in his distorted world of paintings.<BR> Along with the new life as a maid, Griet must deal with growing older, and the expectations that come with adulthood.  The increasing interest that is shown by Pieter the butcher's son, and how she should react to him as well as his advances.  She knows the advantages marriage would have to her family- it would mean that they always had meat on the table.  Since they don't make very much money, they have been eating poorly, and if she married the butcher's son, this wouldn't be a problem.  <BR> There are many parts in the story when Griet goes to the center of the town square and stands on an eight-pointed star in the center of the square.  Standing on this star, looking in all the directions it points her, Griet makes some very important choices, she must choose between security in marriage, and the uncertain life as a maid, where she could be cast out on a whim.  She misses her family, and could go back to them, or she could choose a completely different option.  As she stands in the middle of the square, she makes her decision; \\"When I made my choice, the choice I knew I had to make, I set my feet carefully along the edge of the point and went the way it told me, walking steadily\\" (Chevalier 216).
0345363132|5.0|As a preface, the first time I read this book, I didn't know any of the Richard III story.  After reading Sunne in Splendour, which tells his story from a sympathetic perspective to Richard, I won't believe most of the Richard as monster stories.  <br />A story:  I finished this book one evening and had this emotional weight around my heart (I could feel it physically!) for at least two days.  Someone called me the night I finished and asked if I wanted to join her for karaoke, normally something I'd jump at the chance to do.  I told her that I couldn't do it.  I was so depressed.  But I was revelling in the fact that a book was able to inspire such strong emotion from me.  The sign of a truly excellent book.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|There has been some complaint that SAY YOU WILL doesn't sound like a typical Fleetwood Mac album.  The irony, of course, is that there really isn't any such thing as a \\"typical\\" Fleetwood Mac album. With a history stretching back to the 1960s and line ups that have included Peter Green, Jeremy Spenser, Bob Welch, Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, the band has never really generated a consistent sound.  And that has even been true of the \\"golden\\" line up of Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood, whose work has run from the folk-hard rock fusion of their blockbuster RUMORS to the angst-ridden and anxious art rock of TUSK to the chime-like pop gloss of MIRAGE.  So if you expect the same thing you've heard before, you're out of luck--and that's pretty much true regardless of which Fleetwood Mac albums you happen to be comparing at the moment.<br />SAY YOU WILL is easily the most edgy album the band has done since TUSK: at times grating, jarring, and incredibly dissonant, at times lyric and liquid and smooth.  At it's best, it is Fleetwood Mac at their best; at it's worst, it's at least interesting.  The CD is a bit slow to start, with a streak of four selections (\\"What's the World Coming To,\\" \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave,\\" \\"Illume,\\" and \\"Throw Down\\") more interesting than actually enjoyable--but the Mac hits its stride with the fifth cut, \\"Miranda,\\" and from there it never lets up, belting out one memorable selection after another.<br />But there's something missing here, and it's Christine McVie.  Both Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks are what you might call extreme artists, each in their own way working in opposite directions, and left to their own devices they can edge toward the self-indulgent.  And in her absence, it becomes very obvious that the cool edge Christine McVie brings to the band with her rain-spattered blue voice and meticulously crafted pop melodies has been the artistic bridge between the two extremes; her sound--be it at the keyboard or her graceful and perfectly controlled vocals--is sorely missed here; without it, the band seems to lack a center.<br />All of that said, and while SAY YOU WILL falls short of the mark in Christine McVie's absence, it is still a solid Fleetwood Mac album--and perhaps more than any other of their albums it is one that requires several listenings before you begin to develop a feel for what Lindsey, Stevie, John, and Mick are creating here.  Recommended--but if you're expecting the Fleetwood Mac of RUMORS, you'll be just as disappointed by SAY YOU WILL as you probably were by TUSK.  And Christine McVie, if you're reading this, we all need you back with the Mac!<br />--GFT (Amazon reviewer)--er sound--be it at the keyboard or her graceful and perfectly controlled vocals--is sorely missed here; without it, the band seems to lack a center.<br />All of that said, and while SAY YOU WILL falls short of the mark in Christine McVie's absence, it is still a solid Fleetwood Mac album--and perhaps more than any other of their albums it is one that requires several listenings before you begin to develop a feel for what Lindsey, Stevie, John, and Mick are creating here.

0345350499|5.0|I have already written a review and said it was by far the most amazing and captivating book of my life to date.  This review is for those who dissagree.<br />To the one who read this for english honors i think maybe you didnt understand it because you clearly cant spell.  <BR>Those people who say it was totally against christianity well it had good reason to.  I am not a religious person in any way but i do know the facts and they are as follows.<BR>1)Marion Zimmer Bradley was a christian<BR>2)Paganism was the dominant religion in Great Britain untill christianity came into view<BR>3) most christians were as they were depicted in the novel because they had a lack of information and most Bitish people were only interested in forming religion to there own benefit at the time.<BR>4)Christians murdered many people of many different religions just because they wanted power so i think the pagans had a reason to be angry at them<br />Oh and to those people who seem to think this book is a disgrace to arthurian legend well just remember no one knows if Arthur or Avalon really and truly existed so all books on arthur are legend and not just this one.<BR>To the one who said Pagans use this book as a bible, they dont, they just appreciate a book which gives people a better outlook on pagans and what they have struggled through to be respected.  you must remember that the christians were the ones who murdered them in Ireland(St.Patrick) and im sure many other places and who also brought about the image of a witch being an ugly old hag flying on a broomstick.<br />If i have offended anyone i am sorry but some of these reviews really offended me and i am just stating the facts!
B00008DDXC|2.0|...and by God was I right! <BR>    (See my review on the Philosopher's Stone)<br /> What has happened in the time between the two Harry Potter movies? Hmmm..  Ah! yes of course! The Lord of the Rings has happened! And did they have this amazing, over-the-top achievement in CGI, called \\"the Gollum\\"? Yes sir, they did! And who was the first to shamelessly \\"borrow\\" the idea and bring it in their own movie? Chris Columbus and Co. for their next HP adventure of course.<br />  I have to admit that this movie is a lot better than the first one. But that does not qualify for a good movie in general. <BR>  Borrowing a lot of elements from the horror genre, this one hopes to bring some chills to the children of the globe with the amazing MPAA looking completely the other way.<br />  The story? ok,  let's see....<BR>  Marty and Doc, oops sorry, Harry and Ron, climb on their flying car, to Hogwarts school, even after being advised not to, by a poorly executed Gollum impersonation. There, they stubmle upon a murdering beast that is set loose in the school, controlled by an evil entity which also controls an innocent student to... ... ...set loose and control the beast.(?)<BR>  The evil entity is using somebody else's body to do it's dirty deeds, much like (well the first that comes to mind) Freddy Krueger in Nightmare 2. This entity lives in a book and is risen when the book was read aloud.... Something of an Evil Dead kind of pilosophy.<BR>  It could actually be ok, if the \\"borrowing\\" stopped there.<br />  But...<BR>  Let's not forget Star Wars, our main influence.<BR>   The Quiddich game, this time a little more elaborate, is an almost exact copy of the forrest chase in \\"Return of the Jedi\\", Leia on the Speeder-Bike and the Stormtroopers chasing her. And of course, the Hint of a love game, between NOT him that has the power, but the goofy sidekick, and the girl. At least in Star Wars they were siblings (Luke and Leia). What explanation is mrs. Rowling going to give for Ron andHermione... who knows (I refuse to read the books.)<BR>  One of the major scenes in the movie includes a gigantic spider, much like \\"Shelob\\" of the LOTR, which did not make the final cut of the \\"Two Towers\\" and was reserved for the \\"Return of the King\\". The spider is almost named \\"Aragorn\\", ha ha!!<BR>    My 9 year old daughter remarked that the head of the giant snake, came right out of Jurassic Park's T-Rex. (She is 9 for christ's sake!)<BR>  And last but not least... the great climax scene... <BR> I think it was the \\"Nightmare on Elm Sreet 3\\", where the school teacher went to the place they had buried Freddy's Skeleton, he had a fight with it, and then, when Nancy lay unconcious in front of the grave, he sprayed Holy Water on it, and the real Freddy burst in rays of pure light.<br />Hmmmm..... Jenny unconcious... the book.... the fang... bursts of light.... make the connection?<br />I give up. No more for this one...<br />To be continued.... (it always does...)
B00005JLR2|5.0|I dragged my friends to see Treasure Planet with me the day it came out, because I love anything that has to do with pirates and had been anticipating the realease of Treasure Planet since I saw the first previews (plus, we were on Thanksgiving break, and my friends had nothing else to do). All three of us fourteen-year-old girls loved it to death! We left the theater, raving about how good it was. <BR>The animation, a combination of traditional drawn animation and computer effects, was awesome. The music was beautiful, both the score and the two songs that were sung. The story, based closely on Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, was intriguing. I could relate to Jim Hawkins's teenage rebel attitude. Captain Amelia, too, was extremely likeable, and a strong female character. B.E.N., the Bio-Electronic Navigator robot, got on my nerves after a while, but he was the movie's only flaw. Also included in the cast of characters is an adorable, pink, shapeshifting blob called \\"Morph.\\"<BR>There was humor, action, and emotional scenes aplenty. One scene, where Morph turns into a hand in order to poke a bad guy in the eye, made me shriek with laughter, when just minutes before an especially heart-rending scene left me on the verge of tears. <BR>All in all, an excellent family film for all ages. Treasure Planet has won a special place in my heart among other disney favorites, right next to Beauty and the Beast and Tuck Everlasting.
0061020710|5.0|Look, if you are a fan of fantasy, then pick this book up. It will have you in stitches. This is where the whole Discworld series gets it start. <BR>Pratchett is on par with Christopher Moore and Douglas Adams.
B00004R99K|5.0|This is a most amazing film, full of colour and vision, and filled with delightful characters.<br />I love the psychedelic effect, which is probably a bit ahead of its time being a precursor to the 60's style.<br />Alice is brought to life, in an amazing way for an animated character, and she is quite appealing.<br />The scene opens with Alice (read by Kathryn Beaumont) lying on branch of a tree with her cat Dinah, being read a dull history lesson, by her stuffy older sister.<br /><br />She begins to think about how her world would be like...before being distracted by a White Rabbit, who is late for a very important date...<br />The effects large and small are remarkable and no small detail is left out.<br />I love the way Dinah waves at her with her little paw when Alice is falling down the hole.<br />The hazy world of the hookah smoking Caterpillar, the crazy antics of the disappearing and reappearing Cheshire Cat, and the total whimsy of the Mad Hatter and March Hare ,are all captured exactly the way, I think, Lewis Carroll intended it to be.<br />Alice interacts with just the right balance to all of these characters and creatures.<br />You can watch this again and again, and unlike some of the other Disney movies, you always pick up something new each time.<br />And there are indeed lessons to be learned from this movie.<br />For one thing alice always persevers to get out of this Crazyland. She shows a lot of intitative in trying to do so , and never gives up.<br />And we can all learn from the words of the Cheshire Cat.<br />When Alice asks him where she should go , he replies \\"That depends on where you want to get to\\"<br />We all need to first decide where we want to get to , before we decide which road to take.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|I had to watch this film 3 or 4 times to really figure out what happened.  That's not a bad thing, though!  Each time I watch it, I find myself saying, &quot;Oooh, I get it now!&quot;  You really have to pay attention to every single scene or you'll miss something.  That's the beauty of this film.  It has great replay value!  You very rarely come across a film that makes you think.  This is a small gem that will stay in my DVD library for a long time.
B00008973Q|5.0|I first saw this film in a movie theater and hearing that this new remastered version was coming out on DVD made me very excited. I was very satisfied with the quality of the image on the DVD, in contrast to some other reviewers. I watched it on my TV, but also played some sequences on my Apple computer LCD display, and I don't see any of the pixellated images or sparkling that some reviewers complained about. Since some also said there was no commentary or other special features (my disk had several special features) perhaps there is more than one disk run out there, or production was uneven.<BR>As far as the film quality itself, it is one of my favorite films, because of the beauty and terror of the scenes, the terrific interactions of the players, in word and expression, and the character of Lady Kaede--she is just magnificent ... no words can adequately describe the character Kurosawa wrote nor the performance by the actress.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This film went through my living room and the rest of the house like a wind of characters, thoughts, scenes and music.  What a temp.  It went with a speed of light.  I had the feeling that this movie was made just in one take.  Outstanding.  <br />The combination of the excellent screenplay, great director, good actors and the music that you cannot forget never ever made this filt the one of the best movies ever produced.  I felt as I was picked by this movie, swirled around, taken to different places and than dropped on my head.  And, I was happy.  This movie made me happy.  I enjoyed every moment of it and I cannot recommend it more than that.  This is a show you would not forget.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Awful movie embaressing songs , awful acting by far one of the worst movies ever made.
B000063DHL|5.0|Maiden was big in the 80s.  \\"Live After Death\\" became their best live effort to date and the band's going strong in what is now considered their \\"classic\\" line-up.  With brand new guitar synthesizers out in 1986, the band decided to experiment with them and bring about a slightly more progressed but musically sophisticated album.<br />This and \\"Powerslave\\" were the albums that got me hooked to Maiden and this one forever remains my favorite.  It may not be their best (many labeled \\"Seventh Son\\" or \\"Number of the Beast\\"), but it has a lot of good material that should not be forgotten.<br />Caught Somewhere in Time - a GREAT OPENING track.  Almost an epic but a solid rocker as well.  Solid instrumentation.  The chorus is infectious as well, even if it is redundant somewhat.<br />Wasted Years - My ALL TIME FAVORITE SONG FROM THIS BAND.  Adrian Smith is a musical genius and you can see why Smith's leaving hurt the band.  Great instrumentation, vocals, everything.  The guitar synth really adds to this.<br />Sea of Madness - Probably the weakest on the album, but still great by all means.<br />Heaven Can Wait - The synth boosts this one up quite well.  The chorus pulls itself off in a minor way but becomes a great chorus anyways.  I really like the bassline in this one.<br />Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner - An epic-toned song.  Pretty good song.  Doesn't really stand on its own quite as well as the others, but this is still noteworthy Maiden.<br />Stranger in a Stranger Land - Great song.  A Maiden classic!  The guitarwork is extroadinary.  The synthesized background provides a great backdrop for this tale.<br />Deja Vu - Largely underrated by fans, this one of the first songs to get me hooked into this great metal band.  The lyrics are just astounding and the solo trade-off is just brilliant.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR FIRST-TIME MAIDEN LISTENERS TO GIVE THIS SONG A SHOT.<br />Alexander the Great - An 8-minute epic about the great conqueror.  The guitarwork and vocals are simply brilliant here and I'm saddened that they don't play this one live (Steve Harris said in an interview that \\"Adrian Smith forgot how to play it,\\" or something along those lines.  Whatever the case may be, this song is too brilliant to be ignored in a live setting).  I wouldn't compare this to Rime of the Ancient Mariner; both are simply brilliant.<br />Overall, I highly recommend any metalhead to give this one a shot.  Many were put off by its progressive sound and the fact that they used synthesizers (GUITAR synthesizers), but that just shows ignorance.  This is a metal milestone and it should not be forgotten.ls are simply brilliant here and I'm saddened that they don't play this one live (Steve Harris said in an interview that \\"Adrian Smith forgot how to play it,\\" or something along those lines.

B00005JLSE|5.0|No other words to describe this glorious film perfection all around , with an amazing score , fantastic performances and just perfect art direction it is hard not to like it. All the cast put in career best peformances and it is so superbly adapted from the stage show nobody alive today could of directed it better. By far the best film of the year.
B000002H2H|5.0|While I still think Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All are better albums, I think Ride The Lightning is the first thrash metal or metal in general album to have that epic feel to it. \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" already shows the band's maturation. Jame's lyrics take on much more of mental image and more meaning to them it seems like. \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" now a Metallica regular in setlists, is one of their best songs they've ever written. \\"Fade To Black\\" upstage any metal ballad by anyone (yes even Pantera's Cemetary Gates which in my opinion is an overrated song. Don't get me wrong I love Pantera but they have better songs). I think this shows any haters that consider Metallica just your typical metal band. \\"Creeping Death\\" is just a great metal song its that easy. I suggest you hear the Woodstock 99' version of this to truely grasp how great this song is live. I strongly recommend you buy this album. It shows how truely great this band is. Please if your gonna start somewhere with Metallica make sure its before Black Album.

0440237688|5.0|The Giver<BR>  By Lois Lowry <br />The Giver is a fantasy novel by Lois Lowry.  The setting is a fantasy utopia, where every family unit has a mom, a dad, a son and a daughter.  Everyone has a job chosen by the elders set to the recipient's mental, emotional and physical health. Jonas, the main character, is growing up with a group of kids the same age as he is. On the day Jonas' group turns 12, they get their \\"assignments\\" which is their lifelong job. Jonas gets a very special job.  He is to be the \\"Receiver of Memory.\\" <BR>In the utopia Jonas lives in, people don't want to have the burden of war, hate, pain and love, but they also give up sunshine, snow, color and music. They do not simply give the memories up. They give them to the \\"receiver.\\"  The \\"receiver\\" can aid the elders in decisions they have not faced before. When Jonas becomes the \\"receiver\\" he learns of the true nature of life and death and how many bad things his family and friends are trained to do, but not think badly about. When the old receiver, named The Giver by Jonas, transfer memories to Jonas, it is with almost psychic power.  Jonas gets to live these old memories with all the senses he has.  He actually feels like he is reliving terrible past events.  He finds out terrible things. When Jonas learns of the worst things, he decides he can no longer live in this community.  He decides he must leave and he takes with him the one person he has grown to love and can't bear to abandon that person to what fate has in store for them if left in the community.  <BR>The book is very detailed about the community and its people.  You actually begin to enjoy watching them come to life, and when you begin to learn things about them, you feel angry. Lois Lowry does a great job relating Jonas feelings of anguish and betrayal as he makes one of the hardest decisions in his life.  The climax is very good and you are left with idea that maybe a couple of things could have happened, and you need to decide what kind of person you are to end the book for yourself.  And added benefit is that it is not a very hard read and anyone above the 4th grade should easily be able to read it. I highly recommend the book to anyone who likes to read fantasy novels.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna has matured both musically, vocally and personnally. This is not a mere pop album, though mainstream. Texts are personal (like in Mother and Father, intervention, easy ride). The voice is gorgeous and close (the woman actually sings very well without vocoder), particularly on Nothing fails, Xtatic process. The music is well-composed and melodies sound beautiful. A great electro-pop album. Classic but already hype. People wanna hear real music, and that's why the album is number one.
B00003CXBH|5.0|magnificent, profoundly moving masterpiece. I permanently lost all faith in Ebert and Siskel when it made their ten-worst list for the year, when it is on my ten-best list of all time! I went to it over and over, and took friends, and we would stand hugging and sobbing on the sidewalk afterward. It is an intelligent, spiritual, compassionate film, and one of the final lines \\"Thus have we made (the world)\\" resonates to this day in all my decisions. Ennio Morricone was robbed of an Oscar for the soundtrack, as it, too, is one of the most beautiful works ever recorded, and entirely appropriate to this emotionally devastating film. Every politician, every priest, and everyone who thinks to impose his or her will on others should see this film.
B00008DDXC|5.0|If you love Harry Potter, this is a fantastic DVD with lots of cool extras for true HP fans.  The sound is great as you would expect, there is the widescreen feature(of course)... I only wish I had a full wall projecter. :o)  There are 2 discs, with wonderful interviews with the principle actors, lots of neat additional info to checkout using the interactive screens which the kids will enjoy also... There is so much on these DVDs you will need to set aside an entire weekend to watch it all.  You will also see a lot of stuff that did not appear in the movie like printable trading cards, games, puzzles, and places to explore... care to browse through some of the \\"other\\" shops in Diagon Alley?!  <br />Plus, the movie itself succeeds where HP1 fell a bit short... mainly in being exciting and engaging all the way through.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love the Harry Potter books.  And I thought the first movie did an OK job of bringing Harry to the big screen, but it didn't feel quite right.<br />In HP1 the scenes seemed to start and stop, ultimately making the movie seem overly long and drug out.  Fortunately for us HP2 is much better in this regard.  <br />DVD well worth the money!
B00008I8IF|5.0|I never thought that The Jayhawks could ever top Tomorrow the Green Grass, but they did with Rainy Day Music.  I think the title says it all.  Gary Louris really exposes his emotional and sensitive side through his amazing lyrics.  The sleeve contains all the lyrics to each song to follow along with. Also, inside is a great photograph of Louris, Perlman, and O'Reagan.  The Jayhawks have some really talented artists such as, Matthew Sweet, Jakob Dylan, and Christopher Stills give them a hand with tracks on the CD.  If you are an alternative country rock fan, then this CD is a good choice.  Enjoy!
0452282152|4.0|Historical fiction is at its best in Tracy Chevalier's novel Girl with a Pearl Earring.  Although, the title itself does not disclose much in regards to the complexity of the plot; within the first fifteen pages of the book it is clear that the story's core is a fascinating blend of mystery, desire, and distrust.<BR>  These elements captivate readers just as Griet's peculiar vegetable artistry is able to entrance Vermeer in their initial meeting.  After witnessing Griet's appreciation of color and her attention to fine details, Vermeer hires this 16-year-old girl to be a maid in his household.  Griet must leave everything she knows: her caring mother, strong father, younger sister, her modest home, and even her Protestant neighborhood.  However, the change is a matter of necessity; her family needs the income.  Ever since Griet's father lost his sight in an accident at the tiling factory, money has been scarce.  In the 17th century, the only viable option remaining was to rely upon a capable child.<BR> Griet enters into the Vermeer household and learns the ropes quickly.  Tanneke, a cantankerous maid who has been with the family for years, guides her.  Griet is assigned the most tedious and disliked chores.  However, one such daily task enables Griet to meet a young man who expresses special interest in her, even if Griet's feelings for him aren't always as clear.<BR> A second challenge exists among Griet's relationship with the numerous family members residing in the house itself.  Johannes Vermeer's wife, Catherina, is leery of Griet from the very beginning and her feelings of insecurity only intensify as time passes.  Maria Thins, the domineering elderly relative, speaks harshly to Griet one minute and allies her in the next.  Cornelia, one of the middle children, acts upon an inborn wild streak and succeeds in stirring up trouble on a daily basis.  Thankfully, the other five children are relatively well mannered.<BR> Lastly, but most importantly, there is the relationship between Vermeer himself and Griet.  Vermeer is perfectly systematic as a painter, but completely unpredictable in all other aspects of his life.  This characteristic leaves Griet with many questions.  She feels the need to walk on eggshells whenever she is in his presence.  One day, while cleaning Vermeer's workroom Griet is disturbed by the sense that something essential is missing in Vermeer's painting-in-progress.  Boldly, she rearranges the folds of the blue cloth portrayed in the painting.  When Vermeer inquires about the unapproved change, Griet replies, \\"There needs to be some disorder in the scene, to contrast with her tranquility.  Something to tease the eye.  And yet it must be something pleasing to the eye as well, and it is, because the cloth and her arm are in a similar position.\\"  This response is tremendously gutsy for Griet.  After all, her role in the home is supposed to be that of a maid, not an assistant to the acclaimed artist.  Nevertheless, within months this is precisely the role Vermeer secretly promotes Griet to.  The more time Vermeer and Griet spend working together the more complicated their relationship becomes and consequently household tension escalates exponentially. <BR> Reading this book is bound to spark your curiosity in Vermeer and you'll feel compelled to learn more about his actual life.  This is true even for those who typically show no interest in art history; honestly, the book is that good!  Tracy Chevalier has created a novel which infuses accurate details with a page-turning fictional plot.  <BR> Even after much searching and hypothesizing, nobody has been able to positively identify who the \\"Girl with the Pearl Earring\\" was, but reading this novel makes it difficult to believe she was anyone other than Griet, the young maid who left her mark on society.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD was my favorite the first time I listened to it all the way through. They are a Christian rock group, but even at that they have AWESOME music. I am a singer, and personally I think that the girls voice is awesome, the music is the best...and Its really easy to get into the music. Its my top 5.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I first saw E.T. back in 1984 and I remember crying my eyes out for days afterward. Speilberg's calling card is overly-dramatic, tear-jerking moments, that E.T. has plenty of them. But the movie is still as good today as it was back in the 80's, but this new 20th anniversary edition brings with it some new changes, none of them enhance or improve the movie.<br />I bought the 2 DVD edition, and the extras are good in quantity and quality. There are 2 versions of the movie here. The original is the one most people have seen before, remastered with a better print and sound quality. The 2002 Theatrical re-release has some new CGI effects to make the little alien more life-like (his lips now move fluidly). For whatever reason, Speilberg decided to iron out all the violent bits. There are two moments, one with the troopers who originally carried guns, they now carry walkie-talkies. And when the mother says to the older brother \\"You're not going out as a terrorist\\", it has now been changes so instead of \\"Terrorist\\" she says \\"Hippie\\". These changes are inconsequental to the overall movie.<br />The interviews (a reunion interview especially) are entertaining, with warm memories from all involved in the film coming out. The \\"making of\\" piece is especially fun, because you realize how much work went into bringing that little alien to life. The music score performance is nothing special, but worth the occasional viewing. Overall, it is hard to go wrong with this DVD set.
B000002A3T|5.0|My favorite Post-Waters album! High Hopes is probably on of the best songs written by Gilmour! This album marks the official return of Richard Wright in Pink Floyd and even tought i'm a big fan of Roger Waters, i find that without Richard Wright Pink Floyd isnt Pink Floyd! It's a re-made version of Dark Side of the moon! A real floydian likes this album! If it's the last floyd album, it's an awesome gem!
B00008J2DQ|4.0|DON'T EXPECT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS ALBUMN AND GODSMACK'S PREVIOUS 2 ALBUMNS. IT ALL PRETTY MUCH SOUNDS THE SAME. THERE ARE 12 TRACKS BUT ONLY 10 OF THEM REALY COUNT. &quot;I STAND ALONE&quot; IS ON THE SCORPION KING SOUNDTRACK WHICH WAS RELEASED ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I BELIEVE. &quot;THE AWAKENING&quot; IS A WORTHLESS TRACK THAT IS JUST A BUNCH OF CHANTING. THE LAST TRACK &quot;SERENITY&quot; IS A GREAT MELLOW SONG SIMILAR TO &quot;VOODOO&quot; BUT BETTER. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR A GODSMACK FAN, BUT IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY OF THIER ALBUMNS YET I SUGGEST BUYING THEIR FIRST CD WHICH IS THE BEST SO FAR.
0062502182|1.0|Yes, I have to agree with the review entitled &quot;Too Much Hype&quot;.  If you are a careful and thoughtful reader who appreciates literary style and creative, artful expression through writing, you'll likely be disappointed with this book--as I was.<br />The writing style is disjointed and hard to follow, although it is written at a jr. high school or high school level.  It is truly amazing to me that this person is a best selling author.  A real credit to marketing, packaging and understanding the mystery of what will satisfy the hunger of the masses.  Who knows, maybe it was just his 'Personal Legend'.  After reading this book, I thought even I could do it......<br />To be fair, the author did include some insights (albeit fairly commonplace) towards the end of his story.  But I always appreciate being reminded of those kinds of things..and since I spent the time and money, I had to choose to get something out of it.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Romantic comedies may be the most over-populated cinematic genre.  Still, there is always room for one more if it is as good as About a Boy.  Hugh Grant gives yet another effortless performance as Will, the yuppie playboy.  He shuns commitment and lasting relationships until he crosses paths with a quirky 11-year-old named Marcus.<br />About a Boy is as warm as it is funny.  It manages to be entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time.  In addition to Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult (Marcus), the supporting cast of Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz give a fine performance.<br />It is definitely a DVD to buy and watch over and over.
B00006M183|3.0|Pearl Jam have always been a band who bucked against popular opininion and the direction that they should take.  This album is a continuation of their trend to give you a brief glimpse of what you want and then teasingly take it away again.  Since the days of Ten when the band pumped out angry angst ridden grunge they have mellowed significantly with only the energy of the Yield album breaking the trend.<br />Riot Act is in no way a bad album, its alo unfortunately in no way a great album, it treads the middle ground throughout.  Theres nothing as anthemic as Alive, nothing as haunting as Indifference or as melodic as off he goes. However there  is also nothing as bad as Bugs or Push Me Pull Me. <br />Overall Pearl Jam may be guilty only of producing an average album, lets hope, that in a similar fashion to the way that the magnificent Yield followed the mediocre No Code, that the Pearl Jam album after Riot Act amazes us all.
B00005MKA3|5.0|this is the best cd ive ever bought. its just so amazing. get it.
B00006879E|5.0|I just love this group and their CD. I heard the song 'Harder to Breathe' on the car radio and could not wait to buy it. I was not disappointed in the rest of the songs either. <br />All in all, I think Maroon5 is a great group and well on its way to fame and fortune.
B00001PE4D|5.0|I own this movie on VHS and when my mom asked to watch it, I kindly told her it wasn't a movie she'd probably want to see.  Full of lies, deception and most of all, seduction, Cruel Intentions is a story crafted around Sebastian Valmont and his stepsister Kathryn's plan to devirginize the new stepmaster's daughter and corrupt an innocent new student who is unknowingly stealing Kathryn's ex-boyfriend.  Although it's commonly labeled a drama, there are comedic elements thrown in and with all the beautiful actors and actresses in it, how could you not want to watch this?
0345350499|5.0|This book is by far one of the best I've ever read.  It's captivating -- Morgaine is a beautiful character and the tale is well written with vivid storyline and wonderful depictions of the characters and scenery.  A warning: don't start this book if you intend to do something else -- I failed a test because I couldn't put it down long enough to study!  lol  It will inspire you to be a Priestess of Avalon (I'm studying Cerridwen and Avalon now).
0066620996|4.0|In exploring the business world author Jim Collins researches hundreds of &quot;good&quot; companies and selects a handful of &quot;great&quot; companies.  While most are successful, only a few rise above the rest.  Among these successful companies are Circuit City, Walgreens and General Electric.  To determine such success, the author searches for key practices that separate these certain businesses from the rest.  In this search, the author explores the history of many companies in a series of intriguing stories, my favorite being the background on Kimberly Clark.  The study focuses on how dedicated and strong willed employees make the difference.  &quot;Work smarter, not harder.&quot;  Successful management techniques tend to arise from those of discipline and focus.   Going back to the Kimberly Clark story, Darwin Smith was a newly appointed CEO in 1971.  Although he did not feel qualified, he held the responsibility that came with the title and had the determination and strong will to learn and succeed, for over 20 years.  With an interest in the business world myself, I found this book quite interesting and highly recommend it to others.
B00008S2VG|4.0|After reading terrible reviews for this album, I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the haunting, innovative and impressive music on the CD. Not one of the 11 tracks disappoints, with &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; and &quot;Mother &amp; Father&quot; as especially GREAT songs. <BR>yes, this album does have a mellower pace than 'Music' and 'Ray of Light' (songs are more contemplative and ballad-esque), but I'm sure dozens of dance remixes will be born in the next few months, and meanwhile, this compilation offers a fresh and enjoyable collection of new Madonna music.
B000002ULO|3.0|Being a huge Beatles fan, I eagerly consume any new releases by any former member (yes, yes....Richard Starkey included.)This album was no exception, and to me, it yields mixed results.<br />To me, it seems the majority of Beatles fans are split into three camps (depending on who one feels is the superior songwriter and who REALLY was the genius behind the lads from Liverpool) the JOHN Camp, the PAUL Camp or BOTH EQUALS Camp. I am one of those that feels both is the obvious choice. Without one or the other, there is no Beatles (And Ian McDonald, possibly the best authority of the band, would agree)<br />When one takes a long look at the body of work and the solo albums by each, the fact that the partnership greatly benefitted both becomes painfully clear - John's sharp wit and biting style complimented Paul's more light-hearted style perfectly, and the inclusion of George (who made probably the single best solo outting of any of them in &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;) didn't hurt either. So, I'm quite familiar w/the fabs solo albums....and as usual with Paul, it's hit-and-miss.<br />Over the years, there's NO DOUBT that Paul has had the most successful singles solo and with Wings, but the case was usually that his albums, IMHO, weren't as strong as a whole. Flaming Pie proves to be no exception.<br />Flaming Pie has it's share of very fine tunes - &quot;The Song We Were Singing&quot; &quot;Beautiful Night&quot; &quot;Somedays&quot; and &quot;Great Day&quot; all remind me of work he did just after leaving the Beatles, EXCEPT for one thing - I'm not sure why Macca insists on using Jeff Lynne as a producer. Lynne's overbearing style turns everything into a Travelling Wilbury's/Tom Petty-soundalike, and I'm not the world's biggest fan of either, although T.P.'s early stuff rocked.<br />If you can get past the production, there's some gems to be found here, but mainly they are buried beneath Lynne's clumsy efforts.
6304106017|4.0|\\"Evil Mexican Vampire Strippers\\" -- sounds very cheesy, no? Well, as a matter of fact, \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" is. It's also weirdly entertaining in a gory, cheesy, bizarre vampire-laden way, with over-the-top vampires, crossbow-wielding teens, and ministers kicking butt alongside killer bank robbers.<br />The Gecko brothers are a pair of robbers on the run from the cops: Seth (George Clooney), a murdering thug with a few scruples left, and Ritchie (Quentin Tarantino) a murdering rapist psycho thug who has none. After destroying a roadside liquor, Ritchie \\"accidently\\" rapes and murders their hostage (no details are shown), and they take an ex-minister Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his teenage kids hostage.<br />Soon they ramble over the Mexican border in the minister's RV, to a strip club called... well, I probably can't say what it's called on amazon.com. But when a bar-brawl turns ugly, a snake-charming stripper (a cameo by Salma Hayek) suddenly turns into a not-so-pretty vampire. And Seth, his ex-hostages,<br />This is a B-movie in every sense, and there's something appealingly cheesy about it. It's a bit predictable -- you know as certain moments approach that so-and-so is going to turn around and be a vampire, you know that Jacob is going to regain his faith... but who cares? If you're looking for amazing plot twists, this is not the movie to watch. The first half is a seedy, gritty hostage situation; the second half is an unashamed flying-body-parts-wallow-in-the-black-gore-fest.<br />These vampires are not in the gorgeous stylish Anne Rice mold -- they are, pardon the pun, ugly as sin. The dialogue is mostly snappy except for the occasional line like \\"Welcome to slavery.\\" The sets are impressively run-down, seedy and dusty, and the torchlit tunnel didn't even make me laugh at all. (Although as a woman, I would have preferred less stripping -- I fast-forwarded through that part. Or was Rodriegez making a comment on stripper clubs by filling them with evil vampires?) And it takes a good director to not make me laugh at vampire heads bursting into flame as a kid flings holy water balloons at them, or the \\"disco ball\\" scene near the end.<br />Weirdly, Clooney actually makes us care about Seth; he has virtually no redeeming characteristics until the vampires start up. Then we get to see a certain change of heart in him now that he's seen that, including the surreal but effective scene where he lectures Jacob on God, heaven, hell, and why he now believes in them (now there's irony for you!). Ritchie has no such luck scriptwise; this psychotic creep was more appealing as a vampire than as a human. Keitel also manages a poignant moment, such as the scene where he insists that his kids kill him if and when he transforms into a vampire.<br />\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" is a cult film in the best sense of it: Either you'll love it, or you'll hate it. It's a stupid vampire flick in every sense of the word, which is why (except for the stripping) I guiltily enjoyed it. (Not for the weak of stomach)vampires?)

B00005JLR1|3.0|This movie lost 100 million dollars at the box office, an absolutely amazing feat.  Treasure Planet is pretty good for what it is, but i'm not sure why it was even made.  We all know the story and have seen previous versions hundreds of times.  There were no surprises at all in this movie.  Actually this movie was made in order to appease the two directors.  But at what cost?  Well the movie lost 100 million, all the artists lost their jobs and now Disney is hell bent on making only computer animated movies because they are convinced that the medium of a movie dictates how much a movie will make.  <br />Treasure Planet was overall pretty bland and the first thirty minutes absolutey bored me to tears.  I hated the character design of Jim Hawkins and the character of Long John Silver and his relationship with Jim Hawkins was never particulary dynamic.  The directors said their mission in making this movie was to really focus on the relationship between Jim and John Silver but they didn't really get into it.  I think Disney is too concerned with keeping the story so quick and tight that they don't allow anything unique to happen.  It may have something to do with all the time they spend on story, or the tons of people contributing to the story, the lack of experience of the story people, or simply not thinking outside of the box.  I occasionally enjoy watching animation by Miyazaki because character relationships and mannerisms feel genuine and the story is more concerned with relationships and genuineness of character development.  DISNEY CARICATURES EVERYTHING.  In fact, they caricature caricature.  All reality and sincerity is completely gone by the time the movie is finished.<br />With Treasure Planet, except for the part where the song is playing, there was nothing particularly stirring.  It didn't have that magical, goose bump enducing quality like in Aladdin or The Lion King.  It was just ok.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best recent groups to come out with a decent anti-pop album? I can't really say anti-pop but I haven't heard much press about the Flaming Lips though many would say that this cd got more attention than their previous releases and I think that's ashame, this group definitely has a sound worth hearing a cross between the Moody Blues and Daft Punk it seems incorperating the best of those two groups and putting it down in this this great cd Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. I listen to it practically everyday and it never gets old. Tracks like Do You Realize, All We Have Is Now and One More Robot Sympathy/3000-21 give this cd infinite replay value. A great buy, check it out!
0060012218|5.0|Russ thinks he's the only gay kid at his high school, but soon he founds out he's wrong when he discovers one of the popular jocks is also gay. And when Russ outs himself to one of his best friends, he finds out she's a lesbian. Soon the three of them gather a few others together and begin to meet informally for mutual support. They decide to form a club that will meet at school to discuss issues and call themselves the Geography Club so no one else would possibly want to join. But then someone does... And how will the group deal with the harassment of a fellow student who's suspected of being gay? \\"Geography Club\\" is a superb novel with complex characters and situations about finding personal strength to stand up for what's right and about being true to oneself and to one's friends. Hartinger has created a captivating cast of people who enchant this young adult novel, and ultimately the book is a joy to read.
B00006M183|5.0|If you're anything like me, you were one of those &quot;cool kids&quot; who heard of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana before anyone else that you knew, and exposed all your friends to this new wave of Seattle music primarily based around Sub-Pop Records in the early 90's. Then, once Pearl Jam got popular, they changed up their style a bit and got way too popular for such anti-mainstream grunge fans of the early alternative music era. It happened to me, and now I'm regretting being so damned pretentious.<br />Pearl Jam is proving that you can grow up, and your music can grow up with you. As a huge fan of &quot;Ten&quot;, I moderately liked &quot;Vs.&quot;, but after they got such a huge following, my angsty teenage grunge fan self didn't even give &quot;Vitalogy&quot; a chance, let alone any of their other subsequent albums. Then after hearing 'I Am Mine' on the radio a few months ago, I decided to give &quot;Riot Act&quot; a chance, and I was blown away by how much my musical tastes have changed, and how much I've grown over the past decade. Pearl Jam has embraced adulthood, the band members themselves now being a group of thirtysomethings, and it's once-teenage core fanbase now being a group of twentysomethings. Their current style reflects that change so much that it's amazing.<br />I had the good fortune to see them live last night. I was not disappointed. And now after hearing many songs I didn't know before, along with liking my copy of &quot;Riot Act&quot;, I'm going back to find out what I missed after all these years. Give this album a chance, not with the mentality of &quot;This is the band that wrote Evenflow and Jeremy&quot;, but with the mentality of &quot;This is a more mature, introspective Pearl Jam, and they can change just like I do&quot;. You'll enjoy the album a lot more that way.
B000084T18|5.0|when i first heard &quot;patientlly waiting&quot; f/ eminem....i definately needed this cd. i went out and got it...without reading any online reviews. popped it in my cd player...best rap cd i have ever heard in years. 50 cent definately deserves alot of credit for this great cd.
0385504209|5.0|No this is not &quot;War and Peace.&quot; You will not need to put the book down to reflect on its moving prose.<br />HOWEVER, this book thrills and chills. I felt exhausted keeping pace with our hero and his companion as they navigated themselves through a night and a day in Paris, the French countryside and England.<br />In addition, this book also educates or re-educates the reader on the traditional view of Mary Magdalene in the bible. I actually surfed the web after I read the book to learn more about Jesus' supposed marriage-which many scholars support-and the possibility of a line of children.<br />I would recommend this book strongly for those individuals who enjoy the thriller genre. If you are dogmatic in your Christian beliefs or an Art History purist, then this book may not be for you. But if you want a fun, fast read for a few nights, you'll get it with The DaVinci Code.

B000026258|5.0|That sure is one mesmerizing hour-long work.  I remembered first hearing parts of the work on the PBS Series &quot;Cosmos&quot; (particulaly, &quot;Pulses&quot;, Sections I and IIIb).  It wouldn't be until recently (about 2002) that I find out that it was &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot; by Steve Reich.  The ECM recording contains 1 track.  I have the Nonesuch CD (which I like as much) which separates the sections into tracks - which I think it could've (or should've) been done on the ECM CD as well.  I managed to figure out when a section begins by carefully comparing both CDs.  I notice that the ECM mentioned 10 sections (possibly a missprint) while the Nonesuch mentioned 11.  Here's listing which I think would be helpful to those who listen to the ECM CD:<br />Pulses  0:00<br />I  3:46<br />II  8:03<br />IIIA  12:04<br />IIIB  16:02<br />IV  20:05<br />V  25:53<br />VI  31:24<br />VII  35:53<br />VIII  39:29<br />IX  42:47<br />X  47:01<br />XI  48:34<br />Pulses 52:50

B00008S2VG|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this is a CD that will grow on you with listening.  I bought it expecting another \\"Music\\", hoping for another \\"Ray of Light\\", and got something completely different instead.  This music sounds like fusion of past albums, yet it isn't repetitive and it all sounds fresh and modern.  It is a mellow album- the only real dance songs are mainstreamers \\"American Life\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\", and \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Mother and Father\\".  Everything else is mellow, soulful, and acoustically-driven.  Though I don't think that this is Madonna's BEST album, the calibre of the musical and lyrical quality exceeds anything she's ever done- all of the songs are personal and thoughtful, and I really like the album as a whole.<br />More specifically- \\"American Life\\" quickly grew on me when it was first released, and is especially good it you've seen the unedited video that goes with it (it's awesome!).<BR>\\"Hollywood\\" is another favorite track- it is a mellow (however danceable to) song and is really catchy.<BR>\\"I'm So Stupid\\" is my least favorite song on the album, however it is not TERRIBLE and certainly not unlistenable.<BR>\\"Love Profusion\\" is an okay song.  There's not much really more to say about this one.<BR>\\"Nobody Knows Me\\" is a song that will have you dancing along to it whether you can stomach all of the electronic alterations or not (sometimes Mirwais has a tendency to go overboard).<BR>\\"Nothing Fails\\" is my favorite song on the album.  It is so moving and so uplifting- you just HAVE TO HEAR THIS SONG!  And I LOVE the choir!  Definitely single-worthy!<BR>\\"Intervention\\" is another song I would not be disappointed hearing on the radio.  It is a great, heartfelt song (but not boring or slow).<BR>\\"X-Static Process\\" is a completely different song from what anyone would generally think of when they hear \\"Madonna\\".  It is a personal acoustical ballad and will stay with you after you hear it.<BR>\\"Mother and Father\\"...  I really did not like this song much the first time I heard it, but now I absolutely LOVE it!  Single-worthy!<BR>\\"Die Another Day\\" is a good song... everyone's heard it; no need to comment.<BR>\\"Easy Ride\\" is a great way to end the album- one complaint, however- I can't STAND the redundancy in the lyrics \\"I go round and round just like a circle...\\" which she then rhymes with the word \\"full-circle\\".<br />Though I would still prefer Madonna to go back and collaborate with William Orbit- Mirwais is good, but Orbit's electronica is more... WARM, while the former's is choppy and blippy- this album is a landmark in Madonna's career and is a MUST for any fans, and a sure recommendation to anyone in doubt.
B00004YZT5|5.0|I pick up the guitar learning a tune called talk dirty to me (sounds familiar?), then I grew up on the instrument all most in synch with poison's next realeses after look what the cat dragged in. By the time I heard &quot;Stand&quot; guitar solo I forgot abouts CC's departure from the band. Ritchie redifins poison sound so much that a lot of &quot;party hard&quot; fans may not like. Musicaly is the one I like the most.

B00008VGK0|4.0|Madonna's new single AMERICAN LIFE is a parody in itself. I don't think Madonna really expects anyone to take it seriously, but it's a fun song with a good beat and a nice chorus, and interesting rap. The remixes on here, are a breath of fresh air. It's refreshing to see Madonna is working with different producers to remix her material. Probably the best mix here has to be the Missy Elliott remix which adds a nice funk to it and some nice uplifting gospel to the chorus. There's two Peter Rauhofer mixes, they will keep you moving and shaking in the club. Another favorite of mine has to be the Oakenfold remix, it just has this mesmerizing beat that brings the song to a whole new level. There is also a mix of \\"Die Another Day\\" on here, done by Richard Humpty, who previously remixed her \\"American Pie\\" remake. Overall fans will want this single, has some good mixes.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence has potential as a band.  I listen mainly listen to progressive rock and metal.  There are great bands out there like Blind Guardiad, Dream Theater, Symphony X, Iced Earth, and so on.  Evanescence could be just as good... but will they want to make music or sell?<br />     Anyway, the album overall is great.  The songs are more complexly structured than most anything you'd hear on the radio, and I love the paino.<br />     &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is the radio hit that was made for radio.  I can't say much more... that's why the rap deal is present.<br />     &quot;Haunted&quot; appears to be the best song on the album, and it even has a nice guitar solo (tear forms in the edge of eye).<br />     Evanescense can be a great band and hopefully will not fall to radio standards.  I'm waiting for another release.
B00008NRI8|5.0|Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock star in TWO WEEKS NOTICE, a light hearted romantic comedy that's sure to please. Meet Lucy Kelson (played by Sandra Bullock). She is a lawyer who uses her powers to do good, often protesting for the preservation of old buildings and other worthy causes. Now meet George Wade (played by Hugh Grant). He's a rich business man who is looking for a new cheif counsel. He finds Lucy, who wants to talk to him about saving her local community center that is being torn down. She agrees to work for him on the condition that the building is not torn down. He promises her. She is against everything he is and stands for. You can imagine the sparks and comments that fly between these two! The movie is well acted by these two, there is obvious chemistry here and they play well on it. There is a lot of humor, and touching moments. It's a fun romantic comedy that fans of the genre will enjoy. They both shine!
0553812173|4.0|On the overall context of the series, Malazan Book of the Fallen, I give this book 5 stars.  As a stand-alone book, 4 stars.  Erikson did write this book several years before Deadhouse gates, so it isn't as seamless as the other 3 books that came after it.  I do have to say that Gardens of the Moon is a PERFECT introduction for the series.  It hooks you enough with enough mysteries and unfinished stories to want to read the rest.  True, there are situations where you wonder why they were introduced in that particular part of the book and not enough descriptions were written.  But you have to understand, this is a 10 book series.  The composition and writing of the book is top-notch!  The British do know how to structure sentences.  If you can get past this first book, the following books are MOST DEFINITELY 5 stars.  If I could give them higher ratings, I would.  But potential readers, I highly recommend this series to not just epic fantasy readers, but book lovers from all genres.
6305633177|4.0|The quality of this video is not that happening the vibe is thier so that is what is important. Even Lars tells this on the box of the vid!! This was back when Metallicas music was just great. Cliff definately had an influence on the band and brought out the best of the band. You get to see songs the band havent played in years and years.He was just a amazing bass player,even above Steve Harris(Iron Maiden). Its too bad he isnt around today; Metallica may have been a different story than what we hear present.If you are a newbie to Metallica get this DVD and see what the band once was.....

This new memory card boasts a lot more speed and storage space than its grey predecessor, the aspect of the card that surprised me most however is, unlike other cards, it's reliability. Being an huge fan of the rpg genre of games and owning many rpgs has led me to save on this card MANY, MANY, MANY times, and I have to say, it has never faltered or corrupted any of my game saves EVER! Cheaper memory cards are cheaper for a reason. When buying the sony original brand, although a bit more costly, you are buying a memory card of integrity.
6301174240|5.0|You know those movies that you saw when you were a kid and you still get the same thrill when you see it, no matter how old are you are? Moonwalker is one of those movies. Michael Jackson is the O.G. and this movie is tripped out in a good way. It starts off with his famous Pepsi commerical and from there it takes off to his live performance of 'Man in the Mirror.' Now I don't care how callous you are internally this music video will make the coldest gangsta cry,haha. After this video there are some highlights of his career from the Jackson 5 to present. I never heard a kid (Michael Jackson) sing 'Who's Loving You' so good yo. There are some short clips of his famous music videos after this, and then the full length video of Bad, which was fun to watch. This film has alot of twists which I won't give away on this review. Let's just say this vhs is a fun fantasy ride that will stretch your imagination guaranteed. The actual movie doesn't start until about thirty minutes or so into the film, right after the 'Leave Me Alone' full length video. Another reason why I like this film is because the antagonist is played by none other than Joe Pesci, who is a big hollywood name of course. The scenes where his troops are hunting M.J. down at night will have you on edge. I recommend this film to Michael Jackson fans and anyone who wants to enjoy a fun movie with a nice plot and plenty of twists.
B00004WGAI|5.0|TIMOTHY DALTON IS THE BEST PORTRAYAL OF EDWARD FAIRFAX ROCHESTER ON SCREEN, AND THIS BBC VIDEO IS THE MOST TRUE TO CHARLOTTE BRONTE'S NOVEL THAT I HAVE FOUND.  ZELAH CLARKE IS AN EXCELLENT PICTURE OF JANE EYRE AS WELL, AND THE TWO TOGETHER ARE MAGIC.  I WAS COMPLETELY ENCHANTED.  I HAVE READ THAT DALTON IS TOO GOOD LOOKING FOR ROCHESTER, BUT HIS INTERPRETATION OF THE CHARACTER WAS SO WELL DONE THAT I DIDN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN HIS LOOKS - I WAS ABSORBED IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN EDWARD AND JANE.
B000084T18|2.0|&quot;In Da Club&quot; is a fun song to dance to.  And that is where the fun of this album ends.  50 Cent's rap style has been done before (I-20, anyone on the Cash Money label).  The only reason his hit song is catchy is because it sports an awesome beat created by someone other than 50 Cent.  Of all of the famous rappers I have heard, 50 Cent has the least talent by far.  Everything he says sounds grumbled and there is no change in the tone of his voice.  In addition to his lack of talent, his lyrics are poor.  There is neither depth, nor substance.  Nobody will ever care what 50 Cent raps about.  All they want to hear is the beats.<br />I gave this album 2 stars only because the beats are generally pretty good, but 50 Cent had nothing to do with them.
B00000J6AG|2.0|I have recently gotten into the likes of Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, and Orbital.  Maybe it was my bad for not doing more research, but Play is boring to me and I hope I can help others with my taste avoid it.  <br />If you are looking for upbeat electonic stuff, (Prodigy Fat of the Land and Orbital II are my favs) stay far away from this.  If you want repetitive gospel type singing laid over basic beats, knock yourself out.
B000069AUI|2.0|They really aren't that good. I've heard some tunes on the radio, downloaded some others... I'm just not impressed. I caught their performance on a rerun of Conan, it was awful. I don't get the hype and I don't understand the accolades, they're not that good. I'm reminded quite a bit of Oasis and Radiohead when I listen to these songs.  And I must say, Radiohead and Oasis do it just a little better than Coldplay.  It sounds to me as if they took a turn for the \\"let's gain the critical praise other bands like Radiohead and Oasis get,\\" which in their respective cases, both sophomore albums did gain better critical response than the debuts.  This album, in no way measures up to Parachutes, which I didn't like too much more than A Rush Of Blood To The Head.  However, it's definitely not the worst thing I've ever heard, but I've heard a lot better and more entertaining music this year, or any year for that matter.  This is what I would listen to if I had no other choices.
0385721234|5.0|Imaginatively told, romantic  and sensual  - this is a Latin-style fairy tale for adults only.   Tita, our heroine, has a life  of work & misery, caused by her mother who is cruel beyond reason to her and has brainwashed her since birth into believing that the youngest daughter must remain a spinster and take care of her mother for ever.  Fortunately Tita is blessed with magical cooking skills that allow her to attract lovers and cast many types of spells over the people that consume her dishes, amazing events occur all around her.   Tita is not the only talented member of the family either, her sisters are notable personalities as well.<br />I recommend this as a light & funny escape from reality.
B0000508U6|3.0|I hear a lot of Radiohead in this band, which makes me want to listen to Radiohead, ... There was a lot of hype on my college campus when Yellow was released, so I gave it a listen. It's annoying. Seriously, this is what would happen if Jewel and Dave Matthews got together and had a kid who was a singer. This just isn't all it's cracked up to be and I must say I was very disappointed with the buildup to my first listen.  Good, but by no means great.
0385504209|5.0|A friend told me to read this.  I noted that Nelson DeMille gave it a great review and I enjoy his books when I am reading my &quot;fun books&quot;.  It was an excellent vacation read which I devoured in 2 very late nights.  I loved the cryptic clues and entanglement with the Catholic church and the &quot;true&quot; life of Christ.  The characters were engaging and plot twists were fun.  This is not a candidate for any literature prize but it is the best fiction I have read this year, beating Crichton, Lehane and DeMille.  I didn't read his other books so I can't say if this is predictable if you have read him before.  But if you haven't, pack this one along for a great summer read.
B00005JLK1|5.0|This movie was a lot better than I expected it to be.  It was fun and scary and gory all rolled into one.  I am a big fan of what I like to call &quot;scary water flicks&quot;....in the tradition of Abyss, Leviathan, Deep Star Six, even a sub flick like U-571.  I wasn't sure this was going to cut it, it didn't get great reviews when it was in the theaters.  But I was surprised and the story immediately grabbed me and had me guessing right up till the end.  Gabriel Byrne runs a salvage tugboat and is intrigued by an offer he can't refuse, claim a lost ocean liner for him and his crew.  Most will recognize Julianna Marguiles from her ER fame, and she stars with her boyfriend Ron Eldard (who also starred in ER, that's how they met).  The DVD has a ton of extras and behind the scenes stuff.  A great &quot;scary water flick&quot; that I definitely recommend.
0345308239|5.0|It is with a sad twist of irony that I find myself reading this book while living in the United States at this moment in history.  All my life, I never would have thought to be witness to such an event as the current war on Iraq.  I hope this sentiment piques your curiosity to read this book and try to understand the mounting dread I find growing in the pit of my stomach as I compare the actions of our current government against those mentioned in this book.  Once again Santayana is proven correct:<br />&quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it&quot;<br />I hope I am proven wrong by history.
B0000630BT|5.0|Fans of Judas Priest have called them the Metal Gods at least since the British Steel album (which contained the song, \\"Metal Gods\\") was released, and as the decades have passed, Priest's members have shown the world how true that is.<BR>From the Sabbath-esque hard rock/heavy metal of Rocka Rolla to the neo-death metal of Demolition, Judas Priest has shown the ability to adapt to a changing metal scene and still be the best.<BR>A perfect example of this is Painkiller, arguably one of the best albums Priest has ever recorded.  <BR>Painkiller has very little, if anything, in common with classics like Sad Wings of Destiny and British Steel (which are as different from each other as this album is from either of them).  It's not classic metal, it's full-blown thrash, and it stands head and shoulders above the music of the younger thrash bands Judas Priest influenced.<BR>The album gets a running start with the apocolytic title track, and keeps up the pace with \\"Hell Patrol\\" and \\"All Guns Blazing\\".  This lightning-fast pace is both a strength and a weakness.  At first, it gets the heart racing and the adrenaline pumping, but by the time it gets to \\"Metal Meltdown\\", it's just exhausting, and the listener will, no doubt, be exhausted.  Maybe putting the slower numbers (\\"A Touch of Evil\\", \\"One Shot at Glory\\") between the faster numbers instead of right next to eachother would have helped.  None of this is to say that any of the music is bad.  If you're a Priest fan, you'll be able to forgive the tiring pace and enjoy the music anyway.<BR>Though consistnelty entertaining, the standouts here are \\"Painkiller\\", \\"All Guns Blazing\\", and \\"Nightcrawler\\", with \\"A Touch of Evil\\" standing as one of Priest's best songs ever.
0688163173|2.0|Unfortunately, Lehane follows his best book, Mystic River, with his weakest effort in Shutter Island. I won't give the plot away, only to say that the entire construct depends on the end, which is reminiscent of about a half-dozen movies I've seen  recently.<br />It is well-written, but lacks the visceral punch of Lehane's best work. While the ending isn't completely predictable, it has a been there, done that feel, and most of the &quot;secrets&quot; can be solved with a minimum of thought (I figured out the main &quot;mystery&quot; in the book nearly by accident). The book also reads very, VERY fast like a screenplay--sometimes it read more like something from Crichton or Grisham (that isn't a compliment). More disappointing is the lack of crisp, standout dialogue that marks Lehane's novels.<br />It's a shame--at his best, Lehane's work sticks with you long after you're done reading (I've read and re-read portions of &quot;Gone, Baby gone&quot; more times than I can remember). But Shutter Island is more of a diversion than anything: quickly read, and more quickly forgotten.<br />Don't mean to be too critical--His writing skill nearly brought my review to three stars, despite the fairly weak characters. His other books are excellent, and I look forward to his upcoming trilogy. But for me, this was a misfire.
B000001EHS|4.0|Vault is a greatest hits album that contains material mostly taken from the Pyromania and Hysteria albums.  That's not a bad thing, since those are where most of their hits came from, but this album still feels incomplete.  <BR>On this album are the single versions of &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot; and &quot;Rocket&quot;.  The Hysteria version of the former would have been preferable, but the single version of the latter is a welcome change.  Also, of course, are &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Love Bites,&quot; &quot;Hysteria&quot;, &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot;, and &quot;Foolin'&quot;.  This is all good.  With the exceptions of &quot;Armageddon It&quot; and &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad?&quot;, the problem isn't what's here.<BR>The problem is that some great Leppard hits aren't.<BR>High and Dry is seriously underrepresented.  &quot;Bringin' On The Hearbreak&quot; is good, but hardly does the album justice.  I would gladly take &quot;Let It Go&quot; and &quot;High and Dry (Saturday Night)&quot; to &quot;When Love and Hate Collide&quot; and &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad?&quot;.<BR>There's absolutely nothing here from On Through the Night (which isn't a huge loss, but still!), and even great songs from Pyromania (&quot;Too Late&quot;) and Hysteria (&quot;Gods of War&quot;) are missing here.<BR>Vault is a good listen, but don't forget that the reason you buy a greatest hits album is to get the best of the band on one CD.  This doesn't give you all of the best.  It doesn't give you all of the hits.  It doesn't eliminate the need for any of the original albums.
B00005JKG7|5.0|After scoring a monumental hit with the original Halloween, John Carpenter re-teamed with Debra Hill and star Jamie Lee Curtis to bring us this criminally underrated little gem.  Just as he did with Halloween, Carpenter creates a gloomy, creepy atmosphere and an overwhelming sense of dread without throwing buckets of blood and guts all over the walls, and he manages to coax great performances from the cast including Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook, and John Houseman, along with Carpenter vets Tom Atkins and the babe-ilicious Adrienne Barbeau.  The film's overly creepy atmosphere and eerie beginning sets the film apart from many others of the genre at the time, and in the end The Fog is one of Carpenter's best films, right up there with Halloween and The Thing.  The DVD is worth noting as well and is a bargain to boot; we get an older documentary from when the film was released, and a brand new documentary as well, plus an enlightening commentary from Carpenter and Hill.  There are numerous film in-jokes as well: Atkins' character is named Nick Castle, who would co-write Escape From New York with Carpenter a year later, and another character is named Dan O'Bannon, named after the man who co-wrote the original Alien a year earlier and would later on direct horror cult classic Return of the Living Dead.  Look for Carpenter himself in the beginning of the film as Holbrook's church handyman.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This is a very nice movie. It is a little scary and violent(I don't think you should let little kids see the snake part).<BR>The actors were really great too, and there's somthing good about all of them. Harry was heroic, Dumbledore was sweet, Hermione was cute, Ron was funny, Snape was cool and Malfoy was annoying(that's a good thing!). But I thought Lockhart should have been a liiitttlle more irritating, like in the book, where you can't stand him.<BR>The special features DVD is worth watching too. This is a must have movie!!
0312305060|5.0|forget for amoment the hype and movies and oscars and so on. at the end we are left with a real beautiful novel. it's not one of those books that has tons of actions and event in them, and it's best points are focusing on the small tiny barely noticable parts of life.<br />a day in a life of 3 woman all in connection to verginia wolf's novel, one's the autor, one a reader and another is sort of a modern vertion of mrs. dalloway, all of them experiencing one day in their life who effects or conclude a lifetime. there's no big special effects here, nothing but emotions, thoughts andreflection of the few people who are the charecters in this book. for me, reading today a story about the simple moment in life was a moving and very intence experience.<br />the way the smallest things in our life, like flowers, a cake, a dead bird manage to express so vivdly huge consepts as art, medness and death, that, for me, is a great experience, both mentaly and artisticly. at times the reading got so intrnce, so close to my own life and thoughts that i had to stop. and that's just about all i look for in a book.
630027179X|5.0|Recent interpretations of the Arthurian legend (e.g., \\"The Mists of Avalon\\") are different.  These recent interpretations are matriarchal and discount chivalry, heroics, and romantic love.  Director John Boorman's 1981 film \\"Excalibur\\" reflects Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Morte Darthur\\" written in 1470.  \\"Excalibur\\" is a lush, green film that portrays the lusty earthiness of medieval life and the messiness of medieval warfare.  To Boorman's credit, sanitizing magick seldom is used.<br />Sir Thomas Malory was a retainer to the Earl of Warwick.  I have visited England's 13th Century Warwick Castle.  I have toured Warwick Castle's noble living quarters.  I also have toured Warwick Castle's basement where the troops, horses and the (unventilated) smithy were housed -- the underground dungeon is small and separate.  Most aspects of medieval life were messy.  The castles portrayed in \\"Excalibur\\" appear overscale to be historically accurate (no unrealistically high airy ceilings), but I believe that \\"Excalibur\\" portrays the lusty medieval lifestyle accurately.  Infant mortality was high and life expectancy was low -- a lusty lifestyle assisted survival.<br />Warfare also is messy, and medieval warfare used swords, armor and horses rather than rifles and computer-guided weapons.  \\"Excalibur\\" is a very bloody film.  It conveys the horror of warfare accurately.<br />The cast is excellent.  Nigel Terry plays squire Arthur and later King Arthur both nobly and sensitively -- chivalry, heroics and romantic love are very much alive.  Nicol Williamson plays the wizard Merlin with a strong mixture of power, wisdom and befuddlement.  And Patrick Stewart provides a noteworthy supporting performance -- an opportunity to view Captain Jean Luc Picard as a great classical actor.<br />Classic works *are* reinterpreted as society evolves.  When viewing Morgana and her son Mordred challenging Arthur's throne, I could not avoid drawing an analogy to the resentment a divorced wife and child might hold for a former husband.d for a former husband.
B00004D3C1|5.0|Point blank-Anyone who says this album ... or isn't creative enough, or sounds like a throwback to the 70's or whatever...needs to get a grip. This album is one of the best rock records made in the last 20 years. It's pure, straight forward, put it in the CD player and drive until it's over rock  music....then do it again. From the first track until the finale' \\"Freedom of Choice\\" ( a Devo cover), you CANNOT lose buying this album. I read some reviews where people were complaining about the lyrics, or how all the songs sound the same, or blah, blah ,blah...whatever. PEOPLE...this ain't Radiohead. If you want some experimental diversity...yeah, you might need to go elsewhere. But if you like fuzzy, thick riffage that grooves like you would not believe, this is without a doubt the next record you should buy. I also recommend Queens of the Stone Age if you like Fu Manchu, but  you would prefer some deeper, tripier lyrics. The Fu however is good old fashioned Southern California music with lyrics about Skatin' Surfin' and Drivin'. I personally think this and \\"The Action is Go\\" are their best efforts. \\"California Crossing\\" is a good record, but it doesn't quite have the energy as \\"King\\". Immediately purchase \\"King of the Road\\"-this is a can't lose record buying experience. (By the way, they have a live album coming out in July 2003 \\"Go for it-Live\\"...so if you dig the Fu..get ready.)
0767830555|5.0|I can go back to all the performances Robert DeNiro has made over the years, but I can honestly say that this was the best movie he ever worked in.  Yes, DeNiro as Jake Lamotta in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was his shinning path to greatness, his portrayal of Travis Bickle was one that still leaves me with such chills.  Taxi Driver was one of Martin Scorsese's best movies.
B00004YX39|5.0|I'd give this four stars if Babylon Sisters were the only song on it.  They take grief for the sheen, but this track is so perfectly thought out and executed it's sublime. I'd be hard pressed to say any one of their great songs is my favorite, but I'll listen to this as long as speakers exist. Transcendent recording.
0790729725|5.0|It's hard to pick what Martin Scorsese movie is the best.  As a matter of fact, \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"Raging Bull\\" were the best movies of the previous decades.  When I first saw this movie, I thought it was brilliant.  Now, over 13 years later, this movie still holds up like \\"Citizen Kane\\".  Probably the best gangster movie of all time!!  And without question the best film of the past decade.<br /><br />UPDATE!!  I just purchased the Two disc DVD set of Martin Scorsese's finest work.  Scorsese and actors Lorraine Bracco and Ray Liotta gives some great retrospect on the grounbreaking film. There is also a few documentaries on life in the mob. But my personal favorite is the \\"real\\" Henry Hill and the FBI agent who help him turn in Jimmy Conway and Paul Cicero giving their observations on the DVD extras. This is a must-have for fans of the movie.<br /><br />Note: I still get a kick out of many of the actors in this film who would appear later on in \\"The Sopranos\\".
B00004XOWM|4.0|\\"Chocolate Starfish\\" is certainly not a great album, but it is a solid album. The problem is there are too many people in general who need to prove they are cool by hating on Limp Bizkit and dissing Fred Durst. All I see are pointless reviews of individuals saying the same nonsense over and over, \\"Limp Bizkit [is really bad], Fred Durst can't rap, it's sad a band like this is so popular, you should listen to real music like blah blah and so on.\\" Fred Durst definitely isn't the most talented front man in the rock genre at all, but he's smart in that he knows what people want to hear and what sells, and that is why, and yes they are, Limp Bizkit is one of the most successful rock bands in the last ten years. This album contains tracks that are seemingly aimed at just to sell albums, like \\"Rollin' \\" and \\"My Way\\" but the songs are good. They are catchy, aggressive, and flow, which grab people's attention and gets them to buy albums. This album sold a record amount of albums, over a million albums in its first week because Fred knows what people want to hear and the band successfully put out music the people want. Their style has certainly changed from their first LP \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'all\\", which incorporated more mixing and scratching, had darker more meaningful lyrics, and wasn't nearly as hard or aggressive as the following albums. \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" is a very aggressive album with heavy guitar riffs, and lots of yelling and intensity in the vocals. Although not on the level of \\"Significant Other\\", my personal favorite album of Limp Bizkit, their third LP was able to succeed. Song breakdowns are as follows:<br />Hot Dog- Not a bad song, all the haters dislike the abundant usage of the F word in this song because they feel it's lack of lyrical creativity, but I find it to be entertaining to sing a long. The beat is catchy and very aggressive.<br />My Generation- Underrated song, DJ Lethal gets to show off his talents, especially at the end of the track, doing somephenomenal scratching and mixing.<br />Full Nelson- Not a very creative song by the band but has a good transition and gets heavier toward the end.<br />My Way- Solid single by the band, very emotional melodic chorus combined with heavy riffs to make a great track.<br />Rollin'- Interesting and very catchy beat that goes with Fred's vocals to make a hit track.<br />Livin' It Up- The best song on the album easily. Very hard and aggressive chorus that intertwines well with the verses throughout the song.<br />One- Pointless song here, not too imaginative and lacks any aggression or hype.<br />Getcha Groove On- A weak tag team effort with a rapper here, unlike Fred's achievement with Meth on his last LP. Beat is almost kind of annoying and not a song to repeat often.<br />Take A Look Around- Solid track, that was the MI 2 theme song. Different style Limp song that still successfully keeps its hard edge.<br />It'll be OK- Not a bad song, that picks up as it goes but definitely not a superior track to the earlier ones.<br />Boiler- Last single on the album, really nothing special about this track, lacks any creativity or passion in it.<br />Hold On- Decent attempt at a soft song as it flows well and picks up as it goes.<br />Rollin' Remix- Great rap song, Method Man, Redman, and DMX all make an appearance to form a solid track. The beat is very rap like but still keeps the original sound. <br />Limp was still able to release a solid LP, although it dropped off somewhat, maintained its edge. It's true they have sold out to make songs that appeal, I can definitely agree with that, but their music is still catchy and stays hard, which makes it appeal. People like to make it out that their music is absolute garbage and horrible when it's really not. It just comes down to some individuals who are angry with themselves and their lives and need to put frustrations out on people who are successful. I'm looking forward to Limps's upcoming album with their new guitarist from Snot, should be something very worthwhile.
B000001DQI|5.0|Certain records are important in one's collection this is one of them. If you call your self a true music fan, you have many artists as well as genres of music. Elton John's GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is it. Benny and the Jets, Saturday Night is alright for fighting,Candle in the Wind,and Harmony. The song Harmony is a song you need to listen to. Now you see why there is over 100 opinions of this cd. Five stars is not enough!
B00008NRI8|2.0|Same story we've seen many times before. You know whats going to happen just by seeing the preview. Grant is great and charming. Bullock is her same old clumsy character. Supporting cast provides laughs as well. All right if you have nothing better to see.
B000002UJQ|2.0|The first couple of times I heard this record I must admit I was drawn<BR>to it, the slick production, excellent guitar tones, nifty computer and<BR>electronic sounds. It is definitely good ear candy, and has some <BR>raucous and rocking moments. <br />After repeated listening however, I've come to the conclusion that this<BR>album is really pretty devoid of meaning or emotion. The most <BR>emotionally engaging song on the album (in my opinion) is Let Down, <BR>but even this song's lyrics are basically without meaning. Most of the<BR>songs are similar in this respect. The words seem disconnected <BR>completely from the music, and while the music is almost always pretty <BR>and complete, it fails to engage one beyond an intellectual curiosity. <BR>The album is perhaps perfectly suited to it's title in this respect.
0783225970|5.0|This film is a great movie. It is about a Cuban Refugee who comes from Mariel,Cuba to Miami,Florida to find the american dream but somewhere along the way gets introduced to Cocaine and shoots his way to the top of Miami's Cocaine Empire. Staring Al Pacino,Michelle Pheifper,Steven Bauer,and Robert Loggia. This is a great film if you like mob films. I reccomend this film to you. I hope you get a chance to watch this film,have a great day.
B00008AY3L|4.0|Oh Ben!?  What has happened?  You went from great moving soulful songs to this?  This is by far his worst album.  It is Ok on its own level, but next to his other stuff, yikes!<br />Hopefully he will understand his mistake and quickly redeem himself on his next one!  ...and to think that it took him so long to put this album out!  ouch!.........THAT WAS MY ORGINAL REVIEW WITH ONLY 2 STARS!  BUT THAT WAS AS PREMATURE AS A 13 YEAR OLD BOY WITH [an adult magazine]!<br />This album is damn good!  After several listens, the songs grow on you.  You wind up grooving and smiling and chilling all in one.  I am sorry Ben, keep up the good work and as long as you continue to put out albums as diverse as you have, I will be there to buy them.
B00008DDSC|5.0|When I heard about this movie I was intrigued and rushed to rent it when it came out on DVD. Halfway through the movie I wasn't quite sure if I had been misled, but as soon as the sparks begin to fly for Mr. Grey and his humble secretary with a highly charged proofreading, the momentum of the movie really takes off and by the end I was left rapt and entirely satisfied by the entire experience. Men may view this film differently than women, but as one of the gals, I found some of the most intensely erotic scenes were after their first intimate \\"encounter\\" in Edwards office which concluded with heavy breathing and the slightest touching of fingers. Though the film may be quirky, it is deeply affectionate and I came away with empathy for almost all the characters in the film. Now that is a great movie!
B000001FMC|5.0|Here is why I fell in love with Swing Out Sister. <BR>They had their &quot;BREAKOUT&quot; in 1987 during a decade where music all one hit wonders and bubblegum flavored (the taste only lasts so long). During their introduction to America we were treated to their kind of &quot;TWILIGHT WORLD&quot; living. However I was never &quot;FOOLED BY A SMILE&quot; that came across Corrine's lips. I knew that she was a true diva. So I &quot;SURRENDER&quot;ed to their &quot;COMMUNION&quot; and found myself loving them even &quot;AFTER HOURS&quot;. Eventually I realized that &quot;IT'S NOT ENOUGH&quot; just to love one cd. I had to have them all. <BR>If you have to start somewhere, start here. Just remember &quot;IT'S BETTER TO TRAVEL&quot; with a sister: SWING OUT that is!
B000059XY5|4.0|As far as I'm concerned, this film was a VAST improvement over the first, empty, Spielbergian Batman movie, what with its horrific miscasting of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, the screwing up of the legend of who really killed Bruce Wayne's parents, (it was a character named Joey Chill, NOT Jack Napier,) not to mention Michael Keaton's poor reading of Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />This time, while the legend was STILL fiddled with a bit too much, it was compensated for by the excellent acting of Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, a better script than the first film, and a generally less \\"slapped-together\\" look to it. Pfeiffer is a revelation as Catwoman/Selina Kyle, taking a vacation from her usualy \\"nice girl\\" roles as the definitely mentally askew pseudo-nemesis of Batman. It's actually a little difficult to fully realize that it's Pfeiffer under that mask, the character is so against type for her.<br /><br />Danny Devito's Penguin is another matter altogether. Who conceived of the Penguin this way in Burton's camp? I have NEVER, repeat, NEVER seen the Penguin portrayed as a sewer-dwelling misfit riding herd on a band of ex-circus performers! Penguin's modus operandi has always been to steal and/or obsess over valuable objets d'arte pertaining to aviary subject matter. Here, he's a bedraggled adult orphan tending to Gotham's oddballs in the bowels of its sewer system....And where did Max Shrek come from? I love Devito's comedy in other films, most notably the \\"Romancing the Stone\\" movies, but I think they did the character an injustice here.<br /><br />However, it all comes together MUCH better than the first movie, which was rushed to the screen and looked it. The tension between Batman/Bruce Wayne and Catwoman/Selina Kyle works great, specifically when they're fighting each other in  mufti.<br /><br />Christopher Walken's Max Shrek is a strutting villain made specifically for the movie that works just fine as the catalyst that makes Penguin REALLY dangerous and who also helped turn Selina Kyle into Catwoman by attempting to murder her by pushing her out a window. One of the funniest lines in the movie is when Shrek realizes that Selina IS Catwoman and utters the immortal lines: \\"Selina...? Selina KYLE?! You're FIRED!\\" after she's dragged him into an electric relay station to exact revenge for trying to kill her and Batman/Bruce finds them in the same place.<br /><br />This movie is MUCH more substantial than the first one. It's very similar to the difference between the first, useless, Spielbergian Star Trek TMP movie and the Wrath of Khan. I HIGHLY recommend this one rather than the first in the series.oman by attempting to murder her by pushing her out a window.

6305603847|5.0|This movie provides a creative story, set only to the music of Pink Floyd. Still, it shouldn't be viewed as an rock opera, but as a real movie, and should be enjoyed like a real movie. We are told, in fragments and memories, the story of Pink, who grew up fatherless and under the control of a stifling mother, and then went on to have an unfortunate relationship with his wife. He slowly becomes more and more detatched from reality, until we realize he has finally snapped, and has been building a &quot;Wall&quot; for years to distance himself from the world. The story plays out in a very interesting and visually artistic way. The music gives every scene a dazzling emotion.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Ok I will admit that this cd is not as deep as the previous ones. However, this does not make the cd bad. No Doubt took a fun approach on this album and I see nothing wrong with that. Especially coming from the dark, \\"Return To Saturn\\" (which is excellent in its own right). I think Gwen is a great songwriter (she is MUCH better than Shania Twain) and I respect the fact that she reveals her life in her songwriting. I also respect artists that try to do different things, even if it means losing some of their fans. <br />My favorite songs are the Prince-inspired \\"Waiting Room\\" and the reggage \\"Underneath It All\\". I also found \\"Running\\" an interesting ballad, pretty and different. And I even like the often hated \\"In My Head\\", even though it took a couple of listenings before I got it.This cd is \\"Hella Good\\" and I can't wait for Gwen's solo project. I recommend this cd for any party!
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay's second album is possibly 2002's best rock album. But I gave it a 4 anyway.<br />Coldplay doesn't deserve to be put on a pedastal yet, based on some 2 years worth of albums. Of course they've been around longer; however, they've only bothered with two full-length albums.<br />Listening to Rush of Blood is like a feeling of deja vu: the band hasn't improved by leaps and bounds over their sound from Parachutes; however, the name of this album's game is consistency and maturity.<br />Parachutes hit the listener with longings and desires (title track, Yellow, etc.) conveyed by undeveloped lyrics and basic musical sound. Rush of Blood is somewhat similar, but only to the casual listener. Martin has improved as a songwriter (check out The Scientist, Politik and God Put a Smile on My Face), and the band has more of the ambient beauty that endeared them to us the first time around (Amsterdam, Warning Sign, Clocks).<br />However, they're not the godsend many people will have you believe.<br />While you listen to this album, make sure to avoid confusing the band's talent with &quot;the most beautiful compositions of our time.&quot; The music sounds great, yes, but - to quote many Coldplay fans - they're no Radiohead. Yorke's band seems to thrive off experimentation, while Martin's goes along with a tried-and-true formula on their sophomore effort. It seems too many people get hung up in the bathos the album may inspire within.<br />Grab Rush of Blood if you liked Parachutes or you're in love with the two singles--it'll be worth your time and money. However, don't expect anything out of this world from this album. The music is indeed beautiful, but not the epic orchestrations other reviewers will have you believe. They're not there yet.
B000002LRX|5.0|Received with almost unanimous critical acclaim and hailed as a touchstone for an entire generation of metal heads, albeit often against Patton's own wishes, \\"The Real Thing\\" was Mike Patton proving that he had what it took to survive in a \\"rock band\\".  Although the album was not quite radio fodder, it was about as straightforward as the manic Mike Patton would ever allow and therefore, as compensation, on his second album with Faith No More, the level of experimentation is amped up considerably.  Incorporating the Avant Garde persona of his original, and at that point still continuing, band Mr. Bungle, Mike Patton changes Faith No More from heavy metal icons into genre bending rock visionaries.  The metamorphosis is still far from a complete overhaul, which didn't happen until the group's following album, but \\"Angel Dust's\\" newly harnessed spirit of diversity coupled with the band's hard rock aesthetics of old creates a fascinating amalgamation of styles.  Spewing forth New Wave pop, \\"Midlife Crisis\\", catchy funk ballads, \\"Everything's Ruined\\", laid back jams, \\"RV\\", and over the top heavy metal, \\"Malpractice\\", all within the span of a single CD, Angel Dust's sheer wealth of ideas is staggering, easily earning Faith No More the title of hard rock's most diverse innovators.  This stylistically varied agenda also displays Faith No More's true instrumental abilities as the band continually plays with deft musicianship and unwavering perfection no matter what obscure genre is laid before them.  Patton effortlessly tackles any vocal style thrown at him, Jim Martin's solos are always staggeringly complex, and the rhythm section moves the album along at a swift pace, interlacing some straight funk and deep grooves within their hard hitting attacks proving that no matter how technically demanding a song may be, FNM is always willing to put in the extra time to make every track as perfect as possible.  While it is still very much a rock or alternative album, constricting itsvery broad concepts to concise, 3-6 minute tracks, the band's increasing fondness for the weirder side of music, whether it's marketable or not, assures that Angel Dust remains supremely original and incredibly interesting throughout.
B0000541AM|5.0|I saw this movie when it was released in the theaters years ago . I couldn't get enough of it. I saw it 5 times and I watch it everytime it comes on television over the years,so I knew I needed to add it to my library. It's a little cheesey,very funny and cool.What more could you ask of a 70's gang movie.
6302054982|5.0|The reason I am writing another review of this movie is because I spelled some words wrong in my last review. Here is my new<BR>review. Covering thirty years of mob life, this gritty excellent<BR>movie is not only director Martin Scorsese's greatest masterpiece<BR>but it is also the best mafia movie ever made. Based on the novel Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, it features Ray Liotta as the<BR>true life Henry Hill, an Italian boy from Brooklyn who after seeing the glamorous lifestyles of gangsters decides to become a<BR>mobster by joining a neighborhood mafia family led by Paul Sorvino. This study on New York mob life is a flawless gangster<BR>that has the words timeless classic written all over it. I am a <BR>real big fan of Martin Scorsese and I find this film that he has made superior to TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, MEAN STREETS, and his<BR>partially inferior CASINO. CASINO can never match the high class<BR>and brilliance of this 1990 classic. It was a great injustice that GOODFELLAS lost best picture and best director to Kevin Costner's epic DANCES WITH WOLVES. Even though I love DANCES WITH WOLVES, I thought this film should've won. Oh well, at least<BR>Joe Pesci won best supporting actor for his terrific portrayl of<BR>hair trigger gangster Tommy Devito, which has to be the performance of his career. I can watch this film over and over and never get tired of it. Of all Scorsese films, this one is my favorite to watch over again. This is not just sleek and stylish, but it is also the greatest film of the 90's. Somebody<BR>asked me once what is the best mafia film ever made. I told them<BR>GOODFELLAS is the best mob movie ever made and THE GODFATHER is the best mafia trilogy ever made (All three films). Now I only wish Warner Brothers would release a special edition DVD of this movie complete with documentaries and commentary because a tour<BR>de force like this deserves first-class treatment. Highly recomm-<BR>endes and a must-see. Oh I forgot to mention the film alsohas terrific performances from Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci,<BR>Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.
B00005YU1P|5.0|This film is a work of genius....therefore many people will fail to appreciate its true artistry, and will only evaluate it at the level of their own sophistication.<br /> To be frank...it is clear to me that most of the reviews I have read on this page are missing what is essential.Anyone using words like 'weird', 'trippy','pretentious','intellectual',is making a very superficial assessment of the substance of this film. In order to run this software, you should perhaps check that your own operating system is in order. One way of doing this is by asking what each image signifies....the musicians, the child hanging onto the car's door handle, the train, the portrait, the dancers, the body in space etc etc etc. <br /> We live in a culture of intellectualism...people coming at you with words and opinions. This is the context in which the film is set...but it is not what the film is about. Intellectualism is repulsive, but it is what modern human beings must contend with, overcome. Likewise you are asked to see through the intellectualism of this film in order to understand what it is actually communicating. Most films are 'fantastic', this film is about reality. Reality is for those who are dedicated to walking the path which leads from birth through death into life. Anyone who has had this experience will be in a position to speak about it. Linklater clearly is. Don't write off this film...its worth exploring. Every image is crafted, it contains archetypal signs, seek and you shall find. 'Dream is destiny' ....if you want to wake up, you probably will.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Some people may claim this album sounds the same as their last record. Screaming choruses and catchy rap lyrics, but I beg to differ.<br />For one thing, there's an aura of new age in it. More instrumental-type effects then Hybrid Theory. The riffs are excellent, such as the beginning to Somewhere I Belong and in the song Numb.<br />LP always had meaningful lyrics, and they don't lose that in this album. The song Breaking the Habit is my favorite because it's very catchy and sounds very good. There's no heavy riffs and it's a simple song, but it took Mike 5 years to finally get the right sound for it, and boy, did it work!<br />The song &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; is a hip-hop beat song. Rapping lyrics coupled with guitar riffs make it one of the best songs on the album.<br />Anyone who has loved LP's songs, such as the hit single In The End and the new single, Somewhere I Belong will absolutely adore the album. 5 stars makes this album one of my favorites.
B00005JL78|4.0|Spielberg's \\"Minority Report\\" is a riviting roller coaster ride.  The DVD version with the extra disc shows how much care and thought went into developing each shot sequence.  Spielberg hired a team of futurists to help project what might be the reality in 2054 when this film is set.  As a result, we have magnetic cars that can climb up the sides of buildings and park right next to your living room.  Tom Cruise does a good job of working as the precrime director, until the precogs detail that he will commit a murder.  The supporting roles are well done.  Samantha Morton who was in Woody Allen's \\"Sweet & Lowdown\\" with Sean Penn does an excellent job as the elf-like precog Agatha whose \\"minority report\\" regarding the death of her mother is the trigger to make the plot spin apart.  TV stars have great supporting parts as \\"The Practice\\" has both Steve Harris and Spielberg's stepdaughter Jessica Capshaw as crime cops as well as Boomtown's Neal McDonough.  Colin Farrell who blew me away in \\"Phone Booth\\" does a great American accent as Danny Witwer.  Kathryn Morris has a multi-leveled role as Cruise's wife.  Lois Smith who was Aunt Meg in \\"Twister\\" does a spooky job as Dr. Iris Hineman; although why she kisses Cruise on the lips remained a mystery to me.  Max von Sydow's Lamar Burgess is brooding and deceiptful.  Philip K. Dick's short story brings interesting themes about personal privacy, identity theft and intrusion into our homes to the fore which make this a film with issues that affect us in the present.  Spielberg attempted a film noir style which he achieved with the stark cinematography.  Hearing the detail of air boosters the cops wore to fly makes you appreciate the complexity of the staging.  My impression is that this is an Alfred Hitchcock-style thriller set in the future with a high-tech film noir look.  This is a great rainy day film to have in your collection.  Enjoy!
B00008S2VG|2.0|I must say that when I heard about the video for &quot;American Life,&quot; I knew something was up. Madonna was up to her old bag of tricks: controversy in order to get her name in the press. <br />Once I bought this album, I realized why: it's just not good. The music is fine, but the lyrics are terrible and repetitive beyond belief (two things that really don't go together). And don't even get me starting on her voice...<br />All in all.... a large disappointment. Hopefully the remixes will save this.<br />Now it is time time for a soy latte and a double shotté. Maybe that will satisfy me more than this album.<br />Advice: Get &quot;Music&quot; or &quot;Ray of Light&quot; if you want a good madonna album.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Treasure Planet is an instant classic !. <br />I am a 35 year old video game designer and found the movie a delightful experience. The integration of 3D graphics and cell animation was by far the best to date. Easily surpassing the stroboscopic &quot; Titan AE &quot;. The movies art style and visual design was incredibly stimulating, and the &quot;extra&quot; content on the DVD gives a great insight as to the conceptual design process. I really cant recommend the movie highly enough, just go out and get it, you wont be disappointed, and will want to watch it over and over again.
B00008H2LB|3.0|Im a big LP fan...i loved..loved loved hybrid theory.  I didn't like Reanimation cuz i thought it was a rip-off.  Same songs remixed?  way to get more money! no way.  But my excitement grew with meteora.  When i heard the first song, i was happy cuz i thought it was well worth the wait...then it was downhill from there...the only songs i liked are the first and last songs.  Truly a disappointment for a big BIG LP fan.  <BR>I'm just gonna wait for the next LP album...wait for them to bring out all the SCREAMING and LOUD ELECTRIC GUITARS and the energy it had on the first album.  <BR>i'll just wait...just hope i dont get disappointed again.
B00008S2VG|3.0|At times AMERICAN LIFE is brilliant, songs like \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Intervention\\", where Madonna reaches her pivotal peak on the record in terms of lyric and sentiment. Whereas other songs, she falls flat. Like the bland \\"Hollywood\\" which I think is too glossy, or the mixed up \\"I'm So Stupid\\". Even the title track is trite and I hardly expect Madonna expects anyone to take it seriously but the song is a joke in itself. Same goes for \\"X-Static Process\\". Why all the religious references? I thought we covered this on another album. It's very overbearing. \\"Mother and Father\\" is an interesting song that somehow works. Definately not her best. Actually comes as a disapointment mainly.
B00008S2VH|5.0|I was so impressed with this album by Madonna.  It definitely is an album that everyone can appreciate.  There is so many different types of music on this CD!  There is dancey-type songs such as American Life (check out the remixes, they're phenomenal!), Nobody Knows Me, Die Another Day and Mother And Father.  You've got the beautiful slow songs like Nothing Fails, X-Static Process and Easy Ride.  Then you have your mid-tempo pop/folk rock songs like Love Profusion, I'm So Stupid, Intervention and Hollywood.  I find it to be an extremely emotional album too at times.  I really don't think Madonna has ever sounded better or sang so beautifully before.  With radio nowdays playing so much rap and music that you cannot understand the words or any meanings of the songs, its so refreshing to hear Madonna again.  Every song is so different and so interesting.  Buy this CD, you will not be dissapointed!
0805062971|1.0|Why is this stupid book so popular?  The author doesn't even know how to write in English.  I suppose Palahniuk is a good author for high school students or for people who have never read a book before.  The ending [stinks], almost as if the author didn't know how to finish the book.  Even I could write better than this, and my writing [stinks]!
B00006690F|4.0|This is a great CD don't get me wrong, but compared to Em's last album, this one doesn't quite match up. The first couple tracks were enough to get my attention and had me laughing when I first listened to it. (White America is funny) but it lacked the quality of the first one. When I say quality, you must remember this is on Eminem's standards. What makes Eminem who he is, is his ludacris, hateful, funny, and downright rude lyrics. I will be the first to say that music doesn't make kids do stupid stuff. I am a big Eminem fan and I love his controversial lyrics. I can easily sing along to \\"... I'm gonna kill you\\" and think it's a good song without believing a word of what he says he does. Eminem is a very talented rapper and for him to make it as a white rapper, he deserves some credit.  This album wasn't quite as \\"Eminem-y\\" as the other so if you're looking forward to the type of music he had on his other album, look forward to a slightly downtoned content on this one. It's still Em though and still great music.
0393312836|4.0|Quiet a bizzare and at times, complicated book. But its classic. Anthony Burgess uses language like no other. Its a true work of art.
B00008S2VG|4.0|The music press have given this one a lot of negative reviews, and that's what has driven me to write this. I think this is Madonna's best album ever, and I'm not a particular fan. All of her previous albums I listened to for a week, then never touched again. All of her later work suffers from an annoying tendentiousness, Madonna telling you how you should live and think and be more spiritual--just like her. This one doesn't have that, the songs are direct and personal and less pretentious and imperious. The songs ARE weird--which I think is a good thing--but after three listens you get used to all the strange tangents, and can get into the serious GROOVES to be found here. The songs are more direct and personal, and I find myself listening to this many times in a row. I don't think any of them will be successful singles, because they each require more than one listen to get into, and that's something listeners don't seem to be able to afford. Anyway, don't listen to the mainstream press, who seem to be more interested in reviewing her career than her music, and give it a shot. And Madonna... you go!

B000002UAX|5.0|Many years ago I had an interesting debate with a friend of mine about which Beatles album was the best. We both agreed that The White Album and Sgt. Peppers were probably the top two. I felt that Pepper was a better album because of its shine, glitter and polish. He chose the White album for its showing the Beatles, warts and all, in their humanity with all their weaknesses and strengths laid to bear. I now tend to agree with him, some 20 years later, and feel that the White album, because of the imperfections and risk-taking, along with a supporting cast that includes Eric Clapton and other &quot;non-Beatles&quot;, is a more durable work of art because you can't help but be affected by it, even if it is in a negative way. True art moves you and the Beatles were always great at projecting humanity, honesty, in its most naked form. There's not much posing here, but there's something for everyone, folk, blues, thrash metal, ragtime, and even experimental music a la Revolution 9. They then mercifully end the album with a lullabye. Thanks Beatles. Without the White Album the Beatles overall would be reduced to a plastic caricature of pop. With it they become the great group of humans capable of reflecting true beauty in their humanity.
B00006RIO7|5.0|this movie was absolutely fabulous and of course it had an awesome soundtrack to go right along with it. they are the perfect songs to sing along to. they are just wonderful.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Simply put this album is her best. Why is it her best? Well because it's personal but the themes (aside from the title track) are universal. Most the songs are about love and even loss. It's a wonderful album with great instrumtation and her voice is in perfect order. It's great, I suggest it to anyone! Buy it for Mothers day!

0684833395|5.0|As a senior in Mercy High School, I have been forced to read many a novel.  When I first chose to read this novel I dreaded that I would be preached to on the glory or horror of war throughout my reading.  After completing this novel, I can honestly say that Catch-22 is the best novel that I have read throughout my high school career.  Joseph Heller lets the reader decide whether war is good or bad and never forces his opinion on the reader.  The characters act with human emotions and their reactions are as any real person's would be.  Although the stories tend to bounce from one to another, in the end they come together and form a complete story.  I was unable to put this book down and wholeheartedly recommend it.  This is one book that you will not regret reading.
B000002UDB|5.0|This album is during the Beatles' psychedelic period. It is colorful and joyous from start to finish. I like the second side with the string of singles like All You Need Is Love, Penny Lane, etc. The first side, the &quot;tour&quot;, is great, I Am The Walrus is so weird and cool,  musically stretching the limits of rock.. I'm sorry, but by comparison I can't in good conscious give less than 5 stars to any Beatles album.. and I'm more into the actual albums than the collections because there are many diamonds hiding in the rough, that the hits collections don't have. If you have enjoyed hearing the Beatles especially during their later years, this album is sure to please.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Every once in a while a true classic comes along.  While the majority of people don't find anything special about this movie, I found it to be one of the most amazing films ever created.  Yes, the story is silly and campy...BUT IT'S A SCI FI MOVIE!  that's what they are supposed to be silly!  What makes Tron so special are the special effects, light yeras ahead of it's time.  A computer geek (or whatever) gets \\"sucked\\" into the world of a video game program and must fight his way out with the help of two firends who were also pulled in.  Once they reach the virtual world is when this movie takes off.  Simply amazing special effects bring to life this sci fi world of danger and despair.  I won't spoil anymore, other than the motorcycle scene, the most amazing part of the film.  A must see for sci fi fans.  The great grand daddy of final fantasy!

B000056HUA|5.0|Listening to this DVD Audio was enough to make me shell out $5,000 for a SACD/DVD Audio player, new amp and speakers.  The Dolby 5.1 mix --- which is what you'll hear if you play this disc on a standard DVD video player with a Dolby Digital amp -- is a dazzling reinterpretation of this classic album.  Remixed by Bruce Botnick, who produced the original recording, this version uses the rear channels creatively, and isn't afraid to push the envelope, using panpot effects in a way that hasn't been heard since Jimi Hendrix was alive.  There are enough differences in the new mix so that you wouldn't want to set aside your copy of the original two track mix, but this really shows off the potential of multi-track digital recording.  Quadrophonic sound promised this back in the 1970s but could never settle on a standard, and the technology never lived up to the hype.  Now DVD-audio and SACD are here... and my credit card balance will never be the same! (Sigh) Buy this disc at your peril...
6302969352|5.0|This 300 minute movie was truly one of the longest I've had to sit through, but time passed so quickly after watching this film. I was completely glued to the screen to this 1954 classic. This is in Black &amp; White format, and with english subtitles, and if that's the reason you wont watch it, you're missing out on one of the best movies of all time. You MUST go and watch it if you still haven't. The movie contains plenty of battles, and an interesting plot. I think it's safe to say it's the best movie I've ever seen. (And believe me I've seen a lot of movies) ;)<br />Movie acting score - A<br />Movie plot score - A+<br />It's not rated yet, but I'd rate it PG-13. Enjoy the movie!
6305342776|4.0|The usual reviews on this are bad.  But you need to stop comparing it to star wars and star trek and judge it for what it is.  It's basicly a sci fi movie for kids.  The special effects were awesome for the time and the scenery was amazing.  Their is a genuine creepy feeling to the movie.  Of course, if movies were a few hours longer this could have been super developed, but for what it's worth, this movie is right on target.  My only grievance is with the few scenes where the cast is exposed to open space and yet maintain their composure and don't float away.  Now we all know that wouldn't happen in real life, but you know what?...IT'S A MOVIE GET OVER IT!!! For fans of sci fi and 80's (actually 1979 but definate 80's flair) it won't disapoint.  Disney had quite the one-two punch with this and another legendary sci fi classic, Tron.  I recomend them both, and as always, go for the dvd.
B000001EAQ|4.0|This is a criminally under-rated album.  I don't get it when people call it the LP where U2 went all dance and trance. It does have a lot of great songs on it and little of this sound you call 'trance'.  Discotheque is a classic ,espically the YMCA boomcha! bit (you'll know what i mean if you've seen the video).  Last Night On Earth is the most catchy song on POP with a great chorus, a song that comes alive live on stage.  Other memorable songs include Gone and Wake Up Dead Man.  The only songs i'm not to keen on are 'Mofo' and 'If god will send his angels'.  IGWSHA is one of U2's most bland songs (alongside the dreadful 'Who's going to ride your wild horses') whilst Mofo is just...Mofo.  The version of Staring At The Sun is inferior to the recent remix on the Best Of collection, whilst Bono's recent reworking of '...Velvet Dress' is stunning and better then the album version.  Not U2's greatest album but a scatter of classics is well worth 4 stars.
0316666343|1.0|I had looked forward to reading this book for a while. The first third of it somewhat lived up to my expectations but after that it was terribly disappointing.  I felt like the author was trying to sound clever and deep rather than just telling an interesting story in an honest fashion.  It was bizzare and not in a good way.  I was totally unsatisfied with the characters and what happened to them.  There were so many things that I wanted resolved and explained.  I realize that life doesn't often give us neat resolutions and explanations, but I just felt like this book needed SOMETHING to redeem it.  It was disjointed after the first few chapters, and a better ending would have helped.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Since Mr. Holycross's review is perfect. I am only writing to corroborate his view. It has been 20 years since decent versions of this material have been commercially available. A generation. The vast majority of people who read Mr. Holycross's review no doubt think he is some sort of quack.  I assure you everything he says is exactly true. If you can dig up a copy of a 60's British pressing of any of their l.p.s, you will be shocked and outraged at how this material has been ruined and mispresented. It has nothing to do with cd technology, a thousand good (and dozens of great)60's reissues have long since proven this. This is completely the fault of stupid lazy people at parlophone. If it was possible to give 0 stars I would. disgraceful!

But, alas, our sense of worth, our well-being, our sanity also depend upon our forgetting.\\"<br />Shutter Island is simply devastating. Dennis Lehane again demonstrates a real depth of understanding to the true costs of catastrophic loss. He is one of our finest writers.  I anxiously await his next masterpiece.
0711974594|5.0|WOW! What an amazing book, Just put your favourite Beatles song on, find the page and play!  This was the first Beatles book I ever bought, 2 years on and IM still picking it up and having a jam!  The Beatles Complete Songbook contains 194 songs written<BR>and sung by the Beatles, specially arranged by Rikky Rooksby from the actual recordings, in the original keys. All songs are set out in an easy to read construction showing chord symbols and guitar boxes and complete lyrics, no complicated musical<BR>notations included thank god!  It also contains a playing guide and a full discography which is very useful. Each song played sounds just like the record ,  Every page has that spare space on it so that you can write down extra TABS (solos &amp; intros) and<BR>notations to your favourite songs.  This really is the BEST Beatles chordbook to buy,its so easy to use and you'll never make a mistake playing! Save your money and buy it!
B000000HTM|4.0|van der graaf generator are a very unique band.  they are considered a progressive rock band, but its unlike any prog you are likely to hear anywhere else.  <BR>van der graaf generator are not a band that has any standout solo musicians.  it all sort of gels together to form a singular vibe.  and it is beautiful.<BR>hammils vocals are (in my opinion) otherworldly.  <BR>the music aint bad either.<BR>for fans of dark, moody music, check out van der graaf generator.
B00003OO3O|4.0|Force it from 1975 is the second classic UFO effort that started with Phenomenon a year earlier. The material is kind of straight hard rock with no frills, most notable in the opening Let it roll, Shoot shoot, and Love lost love. The intense Mother Mary shows UFOs ability to really be heavy, while High flyer clearly display the bands talent to write slow numbers with a lot of heart and soul. Force it is a very good album of the rather same quality as any of the albums released from the classic line up (featuring Michael Schenker), and I dare to say that you should invest in them all.
B000002HRE|4.0|Sure, maybe RELOAD isn't the old Metallica, but it is still awesome.  Most people say that RELOAD was a worse disappointment than LOAD, but if those non-appreciative-close-minded morons actually LISTENED to RELOAD, then they might actually see that it is a great album.  RELOAD is probably the most complex of all the albums that Metallica has ever released (closely rivaled with LOAD).  Hammett's playing skills are actually better in RELOAD than in any of their old stuff.  I also have to say that Hetfield's voice is much better in this album than in the old stuff.  Ulrich's drumming is calmer, but he is still great, too.  I'm pleased to say that Newsted's bass playing was more heard, too.  RELOAD RULZ!!!
B00006LLLN|5.0|O.K., I'm a big fan and I was expecting this two c/d set to be very good, but this exceeds my expectations in several ways. Ist of all the sound quality is perfect - I mean flawless - 5 stars. The Song selection is also 5 stars both for quality and quantity, and with 25 songs on 2 c/d's this is a real deal. I also like the fact that there's not a lot of talk - this is 99.9% music without a lot of kidding around. I was glad to see the band cut up a little on the TV concert - that was fun, but this live set is music, music, music. The variety of songs is 5 stars also - plenty of pop for the folks who love ballads and plenty of bluegrass for the purists. \\"But You Know I Love You\\" the old kenny Rogers & 1st Edition song is wonderful and the closing song, Ron's \\"There is a Reason\\" is such a sweet song for these times. A great introduction for new fans and a real treasure for the old ones. I saw them on the New Favorite tour (Mobile) and they were great, but the Louisville shows must have been a peak performance for the band. I grew up in 1960's loving the Beatles, Beach Boys, Stones, Who, Rundgren, America etc. so I'm not really a bluegrass person, but I've got to say that this is about as good as music gets these days, folks.
B00005NGZX|4.0|jane doe was a seriously chaotic departure from the music that converge had released prior.  file under &quot;reckless chaosmongery&quot; if you need label for it.<BR>vocalist jake bannon went through the hardest time of his life, and its here for all of us to see on this mighty recording.<BR>jane doe is quite simply an aural assault on the emotions.  the musical complexity takes a few listens to fully appreciate. converge have tapped into something strange and painful and powerful and beautiful here.  this isnt for leisurely spectators.  this record demands your full attention.  i dont like to choose standout tracks generally, but track #5, homewrecker, really gets my blood boiling.  i have to consciously refrain from killing people every time i listen to this track.  <BR>my guess would be that jane doe has staying power.  i see it as one of those albums that will still be frequenting my cd player 15-20 years from now (if cd players still even exist then).  converge have upped the hardcore ante with jane doe.  it will be a record that people look to for inspiration many years from now.  <BR>i know i will.  go check it out.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|As many times as I have listened to this soundtrack, I never get tired of it. Many people commented on how great it is. I could listen to it for hours and hours and never get tired of it. It has a variety of music from Boy's Choirs to Enya. Howard Shore did a wonderful job on bringing this movie to life with the amazing soundtrack! No wonder it won an Oscar!
B00005JLK1|1.0|Ghost Ship is one of the worst kinds of Hollywood [double dealing] to come along in some time.  No wonder THE RING blew it out of the water during it's theatrical release.  After a very cool opening, the movie falls into some of the worst dialogue, even worse acting and a completely predictable yawn fest.  Not one single scare.  No consistency of performance from moment to moment.  I've seen these actors in other films or on TV and I suspect they can actually act, but wow, [are they bad] in this.  Only young Emily Browning as Katie gives a strange intriguing performance.  The film should've been about her not a sorry [imitation]of ALIEN dynamics.  And while this movie's gorgeously photographed, and lushly production designed, it's not enough to make it worth the torturous 91 minutes of viewing.   Badly executed with a cheeseball score - Ghost Ship should be sunk and forgotten.  AVOID!!
0385507755|5.0|Read this book and you may understand why.  James Frey's wonderful, dark, and truthful portrait of addiction and the infinitely small possibility of recovery is one of the most honest portrayals of drug addiction that I have ever read.  It's not a pretty story as no true story of addiction can be.  Frey writes about the gritty reality of life on drugs and never once attempts to glorify any of it.  His story is sad, honest, frustrating.  Vomit and snot and rage.  Victims, brutality, and very little in the way of hope.  Frey is a Substance Abuse Counselor's nightmare - he refuses to play by the rules, he won't attempt to \\"go along and get along\\", he often bites the hand that feeds him.  His addiction is a living thing residing in his head like a monster with huge bloodied teeth.  I loved this book.  Read it, feel it, learn from it.
0689815816|5.0|My autistic son LOVES this book!  It keeps him engaged and centered, which is frequently a challenge. He loves to recite the lines with me! We have only had it for two weeks and he already has most of the book memorized!  It has been a great asset for his continuing language development!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is Miyazaki's newest masterpiece.  I think this movie is second only to Princess Mononoke.  It is about Chichiro and Haku.  Chichiro and her family are on a driving trip when they stumble into an abandoned old town.  Haku saves her and tells her to get a job there or she will be found out and killed. Yubaba the witch doesn't want her to keep her name and steals it.  A lot of interesting things happen but if I told you that would spoil the movie.  It is a must see.  Anime to the extreme and a story that will warm the heart and touch the soul.

B00004Z459|5.0|Dude up top who said Linkin Park is a boy band obviously likes to get down on a little man juice... what a crackhead!  Linkin Park have their own style of music: stop comparing them to Limp Bizkit!  And who cares if they don't swear... everyone swears sometime, it would have even been appropriate  for them to swear a little in their songs, just like they do when they're in concert.  If you don't like swearing, wait until you're old enough to actually buy the CD... stop posting stupid reviews that show that you haven't listened to the CD.  Linkin Park have released two incredible CDs that I only have one complaint with: they could be longer.  That should say it all when their devoted fans can find no problem with their music excepting that their is not enough of it.  If you don't own this CD, buy it today... you won't be disappointed.
B000068PQ0|4.0|These guys [rock]! I haven't really thought about them since I was in high school, but when I stumbled upon this in Borders the other day, HAD TO HAVE IT. The comparison to Bjork is pretty accurate, but with a little Beck and Prozzak thrown in as well.  Brilliant album!<br />If you like any of the bands I just listed, then this is probably for you!
6305878323|4.0|My 2 year old son and I love the film.  Nevertheless, this DVD is in widescreen \\"letterbox\\" format, not anamorphic format like the description says.  For those of you who care, this DVD is *not* enhanced for 16x9 televisions.  Maybe the Platinum Edition will be?  Let's hope!
B000001E18|4.0|Much like the highly under-rated 'October' before it, U2 seem to shun some of their best work. Zooropa, their 1993 EP-turned-album from their infamous ZooTV Tour, is an example of this. Although a step further from the experimentation in Achtung Baby which would eventually cause them to self-destruct on Pop, Zooropa is one of those albums that grows on you, and shows that even an sub-par U2 is still better than most music released nowadays.<br />Most of the tracks on Zooropa range from very good to excellant. These tracks include:<br />Zooropa: A wonderfully appropriate opener to U2's most daring album. A 6 minute track which can only be described as a musical experience. Hearing Bono sing &quot;I've been hiding. What I've been hiding from&quot; in the third portion of the song still gives me chills.<br />Numb: An intriguing solo from the Edge which thankfully made the Best Of collection, despite U2 seemingly forgetting the key tracks which emphasised their experimentation in the 90s (see Lemon). Definatly an acquired taste (much like the album in general), but can quickly become addictive.<br />Lemon: Perhaps the greatest concept track by U2 ever (just behind the Fly), an interesting mix between dance and techno-rock, if a little long at 7 minutes. U2 even managed to pull a fantastic version of this on their ZooTV video. Sadly, this was never fully released as a single and shockingly never made the Best Of collection. Despite this, definatly a jewel in the experimental crown of U2<br />Dirty Day: What I would consider to be the greatest track on the album. A slow and simple, but intelligent song about the relationship between father and son. Much like Lemon, this could very well have made the Best Of, but was sadly forgotten, not only as a album number but as a live track, after a brilliant performence of it at ZooTV.<br />Obviously Zooropa isn't their best album, due to flat tracks such as &quot;Babyface&quot; and &quot;The First Time&quot; (I don't care what people say, the tune is a half-a**ed remake of Running to Stand Still.) It also lacks the flow of previous albums, as the transition from something like Numb to Lemon (the album's 'highlight' tracks) doesn't work well. You could probably blame the fact that, due to still being on tour, they quickly finished it within 6 weeks and released without much hype or publicity.<br />This doesn't effect what is a truly brilliant album, but you have to wonder how good it could have been if U2 had given themselves more time to finish it.<br />Highly recommended to U2 fans, but casual fans should first get the hang of Achtung Baby before attempting this one
B00006DEFA|4.0|I love &quot;Amadeus&quot; and consider it one of the best movies of all time.  However, the director's cut makes the movie feel too long without adding substantially to the story.  Yes, it does &quot;flesh out a couple of small subplots and shed new light on certain key scenes&quot;.  But this clarity comes at a cost to the overall tempo and feel of the movie.<br />I'm also one who believes that we don't need to know everything (think about the suitcase in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;).  By giving just a hint rather than fleshing out the details, a filmmaker leaves room for the imagination of the viewer, which can make a film more satisfying in the end.
B000056HRZ|5.0|During the darkest years of the catastrophe that was World War II, Warner Brothers studio produced a movie that is, as far as I am concerned, the best movie ever made. Set in December 1941, when the Wehrmacht was at the gates of Moscow, the Japanese were expanding in the Pacific, and the Nazi death squads were busy murdering millions of Jews, this film explores the nightmare and uncertain world of the refugees, conspirators, and secret agents who struggled to find their way at the margins of a Europe torn by war. \\"Casablanca\\" is set in Morocco, under the politically and morally compromised regime of the Vichy French, at a time when the Nazis were winning the war and the possibilities of resistance seemed increasingly bleak.<br /> It is the question of resistance that the film directly addresses, through as brilliant a cast of characters as one will ever find, assembled through the old studio contract system, but no less gifted for that. Humphrey Bogart, as the deeply hurt and cynical leftist, once a committed activist who has left politics aside to pursue his own private life; Paul Heinreid, as the idealistic, committed and daring organizer and champion of anti-Nazi resistance, trying to stay at least one-step ahead of the pursuing Gestapo; Peter Lorre, the shady operator who has committed a crime that may prove to save lives (suggesting the inversion of values that develops in the murky context of war); Claude Rains, the cynical playboy official, who is corrupt and yet decent in the face of a much greater evil; Sydney Greenstreet, who plays the crooked gangster/businessman as well as anybody ever did; Conrad Veidt, who brings the sinister Major Strasser to a menacing life that shadows the entire film, even after his death; and Ingrid Bergman, as Ilsa, who in this film is absolutely glowing, as beautiful a woman as ever appeared on screen.<br /> The film was produced in 1942, nothing special for Warner Brothers, just another \\"crank-it-out\\" anti-Nazi flick. And yet the script (improvised as they went along), the cast, and the theme of the film, create a kind of film magic that has never been matched. And when Dooley Wilson as \\"Sam\\" plays \\"As Time Goes By,\\" he is doing more than just playing the melody that will always be associated with this film. He is providing a kind of musical theme for issues that will always be with us: the struggle between private interest and personal desires versus public responsibility in a time of moral and political crisis; the meaning of morality in a world threatened by radical evil and the need to construct an ethical behavior that is realistic and yet effective; and the importance of love, courage, and obligation to others in a world where the impulse to crawl into one's own private space can be overpowering.<br /> The film also illustrates a too often forgotten dimension of the Second World War; the plight of millions of refugees, stateless, homeless, facing deportation, concentration camps or death squads. How many refugees, trapped and with no place to go, were eventually rounded up for transport to the death chambers at Auschwitz II-Birkenau! When this film was made, those death chambers were in full and active operation, as Nazi Einsatzgruppen carried out their murderous work in eastern Europe. When Humphrey Bogart buries his head in his hands in despair, waiting for the woman he loves, we are reminded of the larger darkness of the world in which his frustrated private love burns. His redemption, and the redemption of the world for which he has spent much of his life fighting, begins when he moves beyond his private agonies to return to the fight for a world worth living in. And let it be clear, the end of the movie \\"Casablanca\\" is not the end of this story. As the plane ascends into the fog-bound sky for Lisbon, the fight is just beginning, and we, sitting in the theater, are reminded that the struggle for a better world is something that is still going on. Rick's fight is our fight: the fight for social justice, for a decent and humane society, for a world in which FDR's Four Freedoms are more than just a slogan, for a better future in which reckless militarism, racism, oppression are defeated, and people rally to fight for human freedom. \\"And this time, our side shall win.\\"
B00003CXI1|5.0|Any Potter fans need to see this movie. It is a wonderful rendition of the beloved book. Strangely, the movie actually follows the book in sequence, action, etc. while leaving few things out. The actors are all perfect for their parts. Daniel Radcliffe makes the perfect Harry. Had any of these things not been the way they are, the movie probably wouldn't work.<BR>  As for the DVD, it is packed with many extras that are fun to look at; Diagon Alley, the common rooms, and other places are layed out so you can experience what 'being there' is like. <BR>  All in all, this is a great movie put on a great DVD.
B00005JLH3|4.0|that's what you'll think when you finish this DVD!<br />It's a great flick!  If you've ever been in a marching band, no matter how long ago, it will bring it right back to you.  Now, most of us only dreamed of being in bands the caliber of those featured in drumline.  They are the cream....I didn't catch the names of the REAL marching bands that participated in the movie (the college names are fictional, I believe)...but they were the stars of this particular show.<br />The filmmakers captured the difficulty and exhuberance of being a part of &quot;one band, one music&quot; and the dedication these young people have to being the best at what they do.  The only recognizable actor is intense Orlando Jones, as Mr. Lee...and he is very good at what he does.<br />The plot is pretty typical...boy who is a little different from the crowd has incredible talent, faces adversity, finds love, finds his way back to his dream.  The boy is a newcommer named Nick Cannon, who has a real screen persona.  He's hard not to like.  The real star is the music, and the marching, and the in your face color spectacle of being involved in marching band at the college competition level.<br />For a real feel-good experience, catch Drumline.  It's awesome!
B000070IXT|5.0|I'm a big fan of computer games and most films that are based on games usually don't do them justice at all, I was definitely not impressed with Tomb Raider. Resident Evil has got to be the best film based on a computer game that I have ever seen and probably one of the best action/mild horror films aswell and believe me I've seen alot of films, The effects were excellent and unlike some people I believe the zombies were very realistic looking, I loved the dog scene but I do wish they had used the dogs slightly more than they did. If you pay enough attention to the film the basic concept of the story line is simple enough even for people who may never have heard of the video game to understand. The ending blew me away I cannot wait for the sequel, I could rave on about this movie forever but let me just say to anyone that if you like action mixed in with horror you will love this movie whether you've heard of the game or not and the ending will have you begging for more.
6302891272|4.0|I was interested in the film &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; because it was directed by Kurosawa, the film making Legend of Japan. I've seen some of Kurosawa's work and I wanted to know how he would screen Macbeth in Japanese style. It was a good thing that Kurosawa didn't change the story line too much. As always, his screen shots were very stylish. I liked the climax, how Washizu was killed by his own men. It added more tragedy in to it.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I don't really like Britney Spears anymore, but her music is okay. i hate the song 'oops i did it again' its annoying! I used to like it before, but now i don't. i do like the other songs though, in fact. i love the song 'don't let me be the last to know' and 'lucky' and 'when your eyes say it' and 'stronger'. i like her songs on the oops cd, i just don't like the 'oops i did it again song'. It's really dumb. anyways, if you're a britney fan or just like her songs then buy this cd if you want. but you're wasting part of your money, just on 1 (one) song which is the 'oops song'.

Since i had read Macbeth quite numerous time and watched several different style of video of it during the class last year long, it came easy for me to understand the Japanese Macbeth also.<BR> Written by Shakespear, and filmed by Japanese, was really interesting. <BR> First of all I really liked the Title of it;Throne of blood, it had well decribed the image of the tagic hero. Washizu had well expressed the feelings of the stong ambitious charater.<BR> Language in the film was in Japanese, old type of Japanese, hard to understand, but still it had well translated. It must be hard to translate shakespears' difficult language into Japanese, but it had well done, and also they transcend the cultural gap.<BR>  oh, my favorite scene was when Washizu got the arrow stuck on his neck.^^
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is possibly the best cd ever, it is even better than hybrid theory. This cd's music is harder and none of the songs sound the same. There is more of the rapping style on this cd but it actually sounds better. Even though the cd is only 37 min long it's worth every penny. Every song is great but some of the ones that really stand out are Don't Say, Somewhere I Belong, Faint, and Numb but every song is really good. So if you liked hybrid theory you'll love this one.

0316666343|5.0|I have never read a book so compelling, so addictive!  I picked up this book and could think of nothing else until I was done with it!  This book was so amazingly written that I felt as though I was Suzie in this book.  Reading it I felt almost as if it was me talking about my life and my family after I had passed.  It even inspired me to get a charm bracelet.  I recommend this book to anyone that has a soul.  I promise, it's as deserving of all the wonderful reviews as you are the air you breathe!
B00008NRI8|2.0|Hugh Grant does his enjoyable act to perfection in this movie but it is so lacking in story that it's rendered mind-numbing syrup even by romantic comedy standards.  The schlock political message they attempt is embarrasing even to liberals.<br />And let's face it, Sandra Bullock is just not a screen beauty, cute maybe, but that nasal voice that not will carry a movie.
B00005JLEU|3.0|OK, I read a lot of reviews before buying it last week, and I thought this was going to be one the best animated movies in my collection. The story seemed intriguing and the animation looked pretty good. Whoever made the trailer for this movie deserves a raise, 'cause the movie sure as hell did not live up to all the hype. It started out pretty good, but it all went down hill from there. The movie seems to wander around and gets a little boring at times. I have a lot of other Disney/non Disney animated movies which are FAR superior to this one. Its an OK movie and I would recommend to rent it, NOT buy it. The idea behind that a little girl gets stranded in a spirit world is actually a very good one but it was never brought to its full potential.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I can see why Norah Jones won so many awards!  This CD was fantastic!  I just received it and listened to it (again and again) and loved the whole thing.  So many times you buy a CD for a certain song on it and find the rest of the songs are somewhat disappointing.  Not this one.  Every single song was wonderful.  I can't wait until Norah does a new CD!
B00008S2VG|4.0|This album is stunning, the songs are all so different yet theres a cohesiveness thru the whole album. The song X-tatic process is worth the price of the cd alone, like nothing she's done before, its simple and spare yet achingly beautiful, Nobody knows me is the roof raiser , and the lush Nothing fails will put a smile on your face. This album is a MUST.
B00001ZWTT|5.0|I love this movie! It has the Most Wild west Adventere Ever!
B000058983|5.0|I came across Forever Changes almost by accident. 2 years have passed since I bought this truly phenomenal record, and I have not changed any of my opinion about it, regarding it the best album of its era and one of the true masterpieces of popular music.<BR>How could such a thriumphant, inventive, delicate and supreme recording be so relatively unknown? I beg for an answer, and hope this will change. <BR>When I first got familiar with Forever Changes, it was like a revelation, and it sure changed a lot of how I regard popular music in general. There was a lot to be reconsidered! I have been buying albums since 1981, so I am by now way a starter in this field. I was absolutely breathtaken, and I still am, I guess. I have recommended the album to any person I come across, and hardly anyone have ever heard about the band and the album. Let's hope all of this will change soon!<BR>So, if you haven't heard the album, and are looking for something to rival Revolver, Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds, this is exactly the one you have been looking for! I will also recommend its successor, FourSail (1969), in itself a tremendous album, although different in sound from Forever Changes. Five stars ain't enough here, I would seriously give it 100 out of 100 stars! Best album ever made, PROMISE!!!!!<BR>By the way, I was so lucky to see Arthur Lee and his band live here in Oslo in may 2001. A very uplifting experience! Hope they will come back soon! LOVE&PEACE FOREVER!!!!
B00006BTCA|2.0|I listen to a whole lot of music and I know you have to give a second and third and fourth listen sometimes. That I did here, but the voice was still ANNOYINGLY reminiscent of Ian Curtis  and the music itself is rather dull...
B000002UB3|5.0|Right in the beginning you get to enjoy one of the best Beatles song that they have ever done.  You will enjoy this album if your favorite Beatles albums are the ones were they wrote every single song on the album starting with Rubber Soul.  If you like the early stuff like Please Please Me and Beatles for Sale then you will not really like this album as much.  Some of the other really good parts of Abbey Road is the End.  After a large grouping of songs that are all thrown together they end with one of the best drumming jobs ever by Ringo.  Another great is the I WANT YOU.  I works well after hearing the weakest parts of the album. This is a Beatles collection must have and is also neccesary for anyone who likes to listen to great music.
0449000729|5.0|This was the second Rutherfurd novel I read (after The Forest), and I have to say that I can't imagine anyone doing this type of historical fiction better than Rutherfurd does.  His characters are brought to life by his intricate storytelling and wonderful mix of the real with the fantastic.  I've started London, and can't wait to dive into Russka.
6305810109|5.0|Based on a true story, director David Lynch delivers a subtle, slow-moving tale of a 73-year-old man's journey to see a brother he hadn't seen in years. Late veteran actor, Richard Farnsworth as Alvin Straight lives with his daughter Rosie Straight (Sissy Spacek). Alvin, wise in his years, decides to make the journey on a John Deere lawn mower. Traveling miles across the rural countrysides from Iowa to Wisconsin, to settle his differences with his brother Lyle who is seriously ill. Along the way he meets people who understand his wisdom and help him along in his journey to find his brother. It's a study in family relationships that even though whatever separates family there's a bond that still makes you family. Alvin knows that before he dies he want to let his brother know they're still brothers. In Alvin's words,....tie them sticks in a bundle and try to break that' Course they couldn't. Then I'd say, 'That bundle...that's family.' As both, Alvin and Lyle seeing each other for the first time in years. They sit quite on Lyle's porch and ponder in thoughts and fades into the cosmos. It's something spiritual that passes between the two. A peaceful moment that finds redemption. It's my kinda movie!
B00008S2VH|5.0|Don't listen to the critic's reviews.  It's just another round of Madonna-bashing.  Go out and buy this album and judge for yourself.  Whether you love it or hate it, it is certainly more interesting and will stir stronger feelings than any of the recent [stuff] being passed off as quality pop music.  The beauty of this album is that it ventures into mostly uncharted territory,  namely \\"techno-folk\\", if you could call it that, and the biggest surprise is that it works -- sometimes so well that it gives you goosebumps.  Yes the lyrics are simple, but sometimes the best hooks come out of the simplest lyrics.  The emotions Madonna feels are simply and elegantly arranged.  There are no filler songs on this CD.  While not quite as radio friendly (in the era of pathetic cookie-cutter pop radio stations) as \\"Ray of Light\\" or \\"Like a Prayer\\", this album has several gems which deserve to be heard by the masses, namely \\"Nothing Fails\\", \\"Intervention\\", \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Easy Ride\\".  Listen to this album and then write your own review.
B000089RVX|4.0|I'm enjoying this album so far.  As a fan of both goth music, heavier rock, and the female voice, this album is right up my alley.  Deffinately worth checking out for anyone interested in the above.  And if you like this at all, please look into Tapping the Vein.  You'll find their music somewhat similar, though far more intense.
B00003BDXG|1.0|This is a pure headache-inducing mess! Bad acting from everyone involved, a bunch of dumb trippy effects, the overall story is worthless, just totally annoying! This movie is only for rebellious teenagers. For everyone else, it's just 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back.
B00008VGL6|4.0|i've read every review i could find of counterfeit 2 and one thing remains consistent: music critics are almost completely inept when it comes to writing anything that resembles insight or authority when it comes to martin gore. their words swim in thoughtless pools of mediocrity; which is apparently where they believe counterfeit 2 should reside. all that aside, anyone who is a fan of depeche mode, and particularly fond of martin, will appreciate this album beyond words. even those who may find depeche mode to be unfamiliar have the potential to hear the brilliance in this album. it's warm and beautiful. Martin's strong, etherial voice and ability to create rhythmic atmospheres that pop like over-sized bubble-wrap is astounding. personal highlights include 'by this river', 'lost in the stars' and 'candy says'.
0345215362|4.0|I received this book as a birthday gift, but I must confess it took the back burner, but only for a little while. I soon dug into it, an avid Tolkien fan, and found myself slogging through Tolkien's essay on Fairy stories.<br />First in this edition is a great little summary and analysis of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, popular in its own right, but now immensely popular at the box office since New Line released the first two novels as major motion pictures. The summary is written by Peter Beagle. Yeah, I know, I never heard of him either, but he summarized the series pretty well, without spoiling anything, so you'll enjoy reading it.<br />Then there's Tolkien's essay. The essay is somewhat long, and quite a hunk of literary philosophizing to bite off and chew . . . and it took me a while to chew. Once I got done, it was on to the more enjoyable things: Leaf by Niggle, the example and essence of all Tolkien wrote of in his essay, Farmer Giles of Ham, the story of the simple farmer whose one act of bravery, and the subsequent events made him a living legend, and the Adventures of Tom Bombadil.<br />The Adventures of Tom Bombadil gives little insight into the mysterious character that we briefly encounter in the first novel in the Rings series, The Fellowship of the Ring. He is a merry man whom the four hobbits meet in dire trouble, and who helps them on their journey. (This is the man that many fans of the books were disappointed not to see in New Line's cinematic version) While he seams innocent enough in the book, it is obvious that underneath he carries power, some sort of power, the prevents him from being influenced by the Ring, and gives him authority to command tree and leaf. But you learn little more about this fascinating character in the stories in Adventures of Tom Bombadil. Indeed, that section of the book contains a few poems of the doings of Bombadil, and a few other poems as well, some of which readers of the Rings books will recognize, being sung by the hobbits in the books.<br />Most of you will probably find Tolkien's essay rather dull and dry, but for the rest, it might be interesting to \\"get into\\" Tolkien's mind by reading this, and his insight into the realm of fantasy and tales. Most fans of the Lord of the Rings (and I'm talking FANS, not just movie-goers who liked the movie) will enjoy it, and if not the essay, then for sure the sections of stories and poems that follow.sung by the hobbits in the books.<br />Most of you will probably find Tolkien's essay rather dull and dry, but for the rest, it might be interesting to \\"get into\\" Tolkien's mind by reading this, and his insight into the realm of fantasy and tales.

0064471837|5.0|THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK!!!! From start to finish I couldn't put the book down, it was that good. I suggest this to anyone who likes faantasy or sci-fi even remotly. (The sequals are just as good, if not better; they're \\"Lirael\\" and \\"Abhorsen\\".) Get this book!!!!
B00005QIPH|4.0|Musicianship of The Strokes: 1/5<BR>Lyrics: 2/5<BR>Production: 2/5<BR>Pop Melodies: PRICELESS<br />Let's face it The Strokes are not terribly talented with their instruments.  No innovation here.  Every song sounds virtually the same.  It seems as though their guitar players knows 3 and a half or four chords.  The lyrics are typical pop drivel.  And I hate how the lead singer's voice is distorted on the entire album (to make him sound older?).<BR>So why can I not stop listening to it?<BR>The melodies are catchy . . . I often underestimate how catchy.  I bought the album for &quot;Last Night,&quot; and just assumed the rest of the album was filler material.  I listened to it anyway and vowed never to listen to it again.  I did that daily for a couple weeks before finally grudgingly admitting to myself that it must be good.  There is something highly addictive in this music that can not be analyzed, it can only be enjoyed.
B000060P79|1.0|This album is the prime example of what really bad pop is capable of. Now, I'm not bashing Simple Plan because it's Pop. There is some catchy pop that I don't mind. And I'm not gonna bash 'em for trying to be punk, though they are not, and if you think they are, you know NOTHING.<br />Let's just focus on the music:<br />Lyrics: Whiny, sappy 12-year old stories of hating the world. Tried and done. Some bands do it. This band doesn't, and it sounds terrible.<br />Singing: The lead singers voice is absolutely horrifying. It's unbelievable he's the lead singer.<br />Guitars: Ok, they can play some basic rhythms. Yay. No creative parts whatsoever.<br />Drums: The only aspect of the band I won't belittle or raise. But needless to say, nothing special.<br />I won't even mention how awful their image is. I focused on the basics;<br />Simple Plan Simple ... , God does hate them, and they are Kids, forever.<br />Don't waste your time on this garbage.
B00004WC6J|5.0|This is not a best of, this is a collection. There are some great collectable songs, some re-recordings and some classics.<br />New songs such as the infamously lost &quot;Ride&quot; make this CD worth buying for any Sylvian fan. True such classics such as Nostalgia and Red Guitar are missing, but the sublme beauty of the music is hard to ignore.<br />If you are a new inititiate into the world of David Sylvian, I would still recommend &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot;. But as a fan, E&amp;N is a CD I would not be without.
B000089RVX|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal!  It's refreshing to hear a band this talented and interesting.  The whole album is full of captivating sounds and layers.  Each song is dripping with emotion and actual complexity.  Nice to hear from a new band.(ie most new bands are a joke in the talent department)  And wow what a voice!  I absolutely love her voice.  Silky and powerful!  I would be glad to wake up to that voice every morning.  Picture Sarah McLachlan meets Loreena Mckennitt.  If you get one album this year, this is it.  Linkin Park's Meteora isn't a bad choice either. <br />Don't get hung up on what the record label says about them sounding like a mix between linkin park and creed.  C'mon, Creed blows.  This band is way better than Creed could wish to be.  Linkin Park is a more fitting comparison.  <br />If you like guitar music, you will also love this album.  I'm a huge Metallica fan and I find a lot to relate to in this album.  There are some great riffs and rhythms and some well phrased solos as well.(what do you know, a guitarist that's not afraid to play a solo.  You mean there are guitarists still out there that actually practice more than a half-an-hour a week?) <br />Sorry If I seem so angst driven.  I'm just tired of listening to non-melodic, overly-simplistic, overly produced, pop garbage written by lazy people that don't care or know how to master their instruments.  If art reflects our culture, we're in a heap of trouble.  I mean the fact that J-Lo even has a record deal should tell that the end of the world is at hand.      <br />But all this aside and in conclusion, buy this album.  You will not regret it.  It's worth your time if you're an intelligent human being.  <br />P.S.  If you like sappy-overproduced-hey i'm a guitar player but i can only play 3 note solos-garbage, go buy a Creed album.  Or if you already own a Creed album,(you've sold your soul to the devil) then go buy another Nickelback album.  I think they were formed in the same gene pool.
B00006F7S4|5.0|You must go out and get this CD.  It's one of the best CD's I've ever listened to.  No kidding.  It's very moving and beautiful.  His use of acoustic guitar, slide guitar, strings and techno is amazing.  Every song has a slightly different sound but all the songs intertwine with one another.  Beck's voice is at it's best...so deep and smooth.  You can't imagine that this voice is coming out of this nerdy looking guy.  It's almost impossible to pick a favorite track on this CD.  Just when you think you heard the best track on the CD the next one begins to play.  This song moves you even more than the last.  The only thing I don't like about the CD is the damn plastic wrap they put on it.  There's no easy way to remove it.  Oh yeah...the disc is bright pink with no graphics save for 3 small stars.  Looks like some lame pop CD.  Bottom line...If you're expecting techno Beck...you aren't going to find it here.  If you want a CD to fall in love with...Sea Change is it.
0385335482|4.0|I borrowed this book from a friend, and was pretty glad I didn't buy it myself. No, it's not a bad book, but, it's not great. The main character - Rebecca - is amazingly self-centered and concieted. Basically, in \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" Rebecca Bloomwood has a problem. She shops all the time, and charges everything, but can't pay the bills, with the cruddy job she has. When Becky tries to quit, things get even worse ~ she can't stop buying things. Finally, the bank keeps calling, and she moves in with her parents. This book is funny, but the only reason it got 4 stars is because Becky's too self-centered. I really liked it, but some of the British lingo was confusing (Ex: in London, \\"pissed\\" means drunk). This is overall a good - and funny - book.
0812550757|5.0|In the aftermath of the Bugger War, humanity's hero, Ender Wiggin, bore the burden of Earth's shame at committing the xenocide of an alien race.  Unable to return to Earth, Ender left with beloved sister, Valentine, for one of the new colony worlds (made available by the extinction of the Buggers).  It was there that he realized that he had an almost supernatural connection and understanding of the Buggers.  Despite his role in the destruction of their species, they entrusted him with the sole remaining larval queen of the species and gave him the responsibility of restarting the race when the time was right.  Ender's new enlightenment led him to write a famous treatise on this species called \\"Speaker of the Dead for the Hive Queen\\".  In it, he told the true story about the Buggers in such a frank and honest manner that it created a sensation on Earth.  Suddenly, humans could empathize with their former enemies and understand the fallacy of having destroyed them.  Ender's work created a demand for him to be a 'speaker for the dead' of many more people.  The sensation caused by Ender's writings created an entire movement of literary thought and a near army of 'Speakers for the Dead'.  As Ender was too restless to stay in one place very long, he traveled to many different worlds and, as a result of time distortions due to space travel, actually was still relatively young some 3000 years after his 'Speaker' movement began.  It was now an accepted part of human culture and frequently called upon when people died.  It helped all gain and understanding and, perhaps (but not necessarily), give closure.  Ender and Valentine finally found a world to settle on for the rest of their lives and seemed content, until one day, a desperate call for a 'speaker' came from a distraught child on the nearby colony world of Lusitania.  So begins the amazing story that powers \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" <BR><BR>Ender travels to Lusitania first to respond to the pleas of a young girl whose lifewas torn asunder by the heroic deaths of her parents.  Her parents were able to find a treatment for a vicious contagion that threatened to kill all human life on Lusitania, but were unfortunately unable to save themselves.  In the 30-year window of Ender's space travel (which was merely a few weeks to him), this little girl has grown up and started a family, but it's a family that is mired in tremendous strife as the burdens of the past still weigh upon the children of the present.  All this happens among the ongoing interaction with a semi-intelligent species of indigenous life called 'piggies'.  Understanding them, while still being restrained by archaic colonial policy, leads to much discord among the colony members.  <BR><BR>\\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is Orson Scott Card's sequel the famous and award-winning \\"Ender's Game\\".  Those who are expecting the just a rehash of some science-fiction scenarios first played out in \\"Ender's Game\\" will be sorely disappointed.  However, for those who loved \\"Ender's Game\\" and were able to see deep enough into the story to understand the truly important elements, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" will be an amazing read.  One must understand that the science-fiction elements to Card's books are just the skin to the entire body of his stories.  Card's literary power comes from his understanding of human relationships and dynamics and writing in such a way that the reader empathizes (and even sympathizes) with the characters in the books.  One cannot help by to feel a powerful emotional investment into the lives and struggles of these people.  Whereas \\"Ender's Game\\" intertwined the human relationships amid the backdrop of Battle School and the Bugger War, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" is almost completely and totally about the human element.  Such a dramatic change in focus is no less compelling.  Clearly, critics felt this way about the sequel, because \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" garnered the same Hugo and Nebula Awards that \\"Ender's Game\\" did.  <BR><BR>It would be unfortunate if fans of \\"Ender's Game\\" (and they are legion) were to overlook \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" and its sequels simply because of the change in focus.  Lovers of \\"Ender's Game\\" will find that \\"Speaker...\\" is equally impossible to put down.  The human drama is so real that the reader feels like they are a part of the story.  No greater compliment can be granted to such a novel.
6302891272|5.0|This is one of the many movies by Kurosawa Akira which I have seen, and I really enjoyed it. By this movie, I realized the universality of Shakespear's play along with Kurosawa's high ability of interpreting the story. The story seemed to follow the original story, Macbeth, well until the end. The ending part of this movie illustrates the tragedy stronger than Macbeth, which gave me surprise. The influence of the woman was also a big theme in the story. There are some long sequence with high tention but not much action. Many discussions can be done about these parts, but I generally like the tense mood. Kurosawa has been my favolite director, and now I am more confident in this idea after seening this movie.
6305736650|5.0|As time goes by, moviegoers all over the world will always remember Casablanca as one of the few \\"perfect\\" movies ever to be created.  Every detail in this rousing, yet melancholy story of love against the backdrop of WWII is mastered, from the stunning performances of the cast to the witty, oft-quoted dialogue.  The mystery, danger, and allure of Casablanca is expressed beautifully through the sets of Rick's Cafe Amer, the Blue Parrot, and the famous misty airstrip in which Rick and Ilsa say their final farewells.  And, blending all these magical elements together, is the perfect bittersweet song that takes Rick and Ilsa back to their star-crossed love affair in Paris: As Time Goes By.<br />Everyone knows the story.  The legendary Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a cynical American club owner who has an especially dark past:  banned from the United States, blacklisted by the Nazis, and settling in Casablanca after having his heart broken by the only woman he ever loved.  This woman, the beautiful, conflicted Ilsa Lazlo, played by the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman, has come to Casablanca with the most wanted man on the Nazi's Gas 'Em Quick list, Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid, playing Lazlo so well, you have to pity the poor guy).  They're trying to escape to America, but the French Precinct, Captain Louis Reynaud (the incredible Claude Raines), won't give them Visas.  Ironically, the only man who can help Lazlo now happens to be the same man Ilsa loved and betrayed in Paris.  Bitterly facing the prospect of having Ilsa all to himself or losing her forever, Rick makes a gentleman's decision that leads to the most beautifully written farewell in motion picture history.<br />The enduring popularity of Casablanca can be attributed to the love triangle between Rick, Ilsa, and Lazlo.  It can be attributed to the sheer magic of an entire city of people desperately trying to get away from the Nazis in a time of chaos.  Personally, I believe this movie survives from generation to generation because Rick himself represents the American people on a whole.  His 'don't tread on me' attitude and reluctance to leap into the turmoil of war appeals to us and illustrates the attitude of Uncle Sam.  Although we've seen Casablanca time and time again, there are always those who tear up at Rick's noble sacrifice.  Then there are those who scowl and mutter that Ilsa should have ditched her stiff-collared husband for her one true love, the tough-guy-with-a-good-heart, Rick.  Perhaps this endless debate is another reason for Casablanca's enduring popularity.<br />Casablanca was a once-in-a-lifetime movie.  Because of the cast, the script, and As Time Goes By, to remake this movie would be as insulting as to attempt to remake The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, or even Dr. Strangelove.  Not that there is a need to update Rick and Ilsa'a story.  Casablanca is a worldwide appeal to every generation, and will be one of the few films to persevere, as time goes by.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Okay, okay. I lied about losing your eyelashes when you see a good movie. But to me, this movie was packed with action and hope. It teaches little children to not give up on your adventures and dreams. Also, it gets kids to read the book \\"Treasure Planet\\" is based on, \\"Treasure Island\\". I say it's a perfectly good movie. And if Jim Hawkins were real I'd freak out! Hee hee! Well, that's it. I hope for the people who hate this movie understand how the movie is good to my point of view.

0767814622|4.0|After watching this movie a few times, I finally read the book and came to realize the movie is indeed only a partial recollection. The only really bad things that happened to Billy Hayes when he was in prison in Turkey were the incident where he slugged a trustee for self-defense after stealing a blanket and a couple guards practicing their strokes on the soles of his feet. The real Billy also did not call the Turks pigs and instead apologized for his mistake. By the end of the book, he was scheduled to be released in 1978, but escaped from an island in the Aegan sea on a dinghy, not impalling the head guards' head on a hook. From what I heard from Turks who saw this movie, the Turkish characters spoke an incomprehensible gibberish, but also most of the actors playing Turks were Italian, and in one case, the head guard was an American who just happened to play Bluto in the Robin Williams version of Popeye. One thing about the movie I don't quite understand: Who in the world was the American (Bo Hopkins) that takes Billy Hayes into his custody to hunt down the drug dealer, and then has him arrested after he attempts to elude the police, then he and the detectives in the case are not even in court during Hayes' trial? Any answers would be helpful
B00000DCH9|5.0|Billy Joel has made many great albums, but this one is possibly his best.  &quot;Piano Man,&quot; &quot;Captain Jack,&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Billy the Kid&quot; are some of the best songs ever written.  The LP also has many fan favorites such as &quot;Somewhere along the Line,&quot; and &quot;You're My Home.&quot;  The album has a great flow to it from start to finish, and has some of the best piano playing I've ever heard.  Everyone needs to have this album, simply because every song on it is good.  In my opinion, this is the best album ever made.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Alright, I can't help it.  I have to say something.  I have read a bunch of these reviews and I am disgusted.  This is a movie that honors the sinking of the Titanic.  1500+ lost their lives and all some of these people can say is \\"I just wanted the ship to sink so that it would be over\\" or \\"What a waste of money\\".  These people are ignorant and unsympathetic.  \\"Titanic\\" allows the moviegoers of today to see the horrors that people went through on that night.  This is a movie that I can't watch often because it is so emotional and tragic.  It is a movie that puts the values of life, love, heroism, loss, and death into perspective. I can remember leaving the theater and just forgetting about all the nonsense of everyday life and looking at everything from a different point of view.<BR>My other problem with some of these reviews is that they say that the love story is horrible.  I personally thought that it was very well crafted and I think that some people forget that the romance gives us the characters to become emotionally attached to through the film.  We can then appreciate the tragedy because the people on the titanic are no longer strangers.  They are real people who we care about.  The professional critics, by the way, are so funny to me.  Some call the public \\"dumb\\" and \\"easily manipulated\\" for liking this film.  Get over yourselves.  I've never seen a critic that has written, directed, or starred in a film.  I know i'ts their job, but why can't people just like something?  Why are we stupid for liking a movie?  Give me a break.<BR>Now, my own review of this movie is that it is very well-made and extremely emotional.  The movie is fantastic.  The music is phenomenal and could tell the story by itself.  This is a film that touched me emotionally and made me feel as though I was there on that sinking ship.  James Cameron put a lot of heart into this movie and it shows.  <BR>For those people with the \\"Titanic [stinks]\\" reviews, I think you missed the whole pointand definitely missed out on a powerful film.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I didn't know to expect from this CD, but after listening to it over and over, I am hooked. This is a completely different sounding Madonna - mature, contemplative, perhaps disillusioned. The songs seem to be a sequal to many of her previous songs, such as &quot;Mother and Father&quot; is an ode to &quot;Oh Father&quot;. <BR>Its a beautiful CD, and as a long-time fan, who has grown up with Madonna, I appreciate that her songs reflect and grow with us her fans.
B00008S2VG|5.0|When first buying this album, I completely looked over the album cover to check if I had purchased the right cd. A drastic move from her '00 Music album, Madonna loses the techno beats and feel by implanting more light rock elements. At first, I couldn't stand this trying to disguise it with another artist's name. Then, it just grew on me. I can't stop listening to it. Even if expecting the new sound Madonna has introduced to the world within the past 4 years, give this album a try. You may just be surprised!
B00005JG6R|1.0|I know of no serious anime fan who actually likes this film.  It's mindless eye candy for nasty-tempered fourteen-year olds who haven't seen much anime before. Sadly, there are a lot of people like that out there, which explains the film's popularity.  The plot is an incoherent mess, moving from one visual set-piece to another with emphasis on violence and spectacle and not much else.  I've heard that the original manga on which it is based is better, and that the reason the film makes so little sense is that it takes a multi-volume story and squashes it down into two hours.  From a technical standpoint, the animation is beautiful (it's one of the few anime films to bother with lip sync), but who besides another animator is going to watch a film just to critique its technical quality?  If you want to see some intelligent, lyrical anime films, I'd recommend Wings of Honneamise, Ghost in the Shell, Grave of the Fireflies, or the films of Hayao Miyazaki, especially Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  (I admit, you may want to see Akira just to know what all the drooling fanboys are talking about, but it really is an awful film.)

I chose El Gusto because it not only represented a cultural difference in music,  but it also, wonderfully, expresses the singer's love for their land, the Huasteca. <BR> The most distinctive part of the song, is the singing. I really liked the use of the high pitched voice in the background. The voice adds a lot to the music by giving the song a more passionate feeling; a helpful tool when expressing something as strong as a love for one's homeland. <BR> Another interesting part of the song, which is a common in theme in music throughout the Hispanic world, is the way they describe the Huasteca as a woman. Using words like \\"Por sus bellas serranias\\" (Especially for her beautiful mountainous country), they really make you see and feel what it must be like to live in such a beautiful part of the world.<BR> The music, itself, is simple. The guitar sounds crude and rough (kind of like a cheap nylon) and the violin is played almost like a fiddle in an old country song, but it works well. The music is like a breath of fresh air in the sense that it allows one to feel free of shame or care. It is this crude sound that allows one to \\"not care whether you can sing or not\\". The music, is all about love and happiness, something which is hard to come by in many of today's modern songs.<BR> Overall, I chose this song because it was the most enjoyable of all the traditional music that I listened to. After listening to El Gusto, I could really see myself, in another time, maybe being a street player, as these men are. Most of all, I could really see myself enjoying the beauty that their homeland, the Huasteca, has to offer. If I was to say one thing about this traditional song, El Gusto, I would say that it shows how beautiful a simple song can sound, when you know it comes from the heart.
0385335482|5.0|This is the story of Becky Bloomwood a herione for all addicted shoppers.  I first picked up this book based on it's title &quot;shopaholic&quot; something I have confessed to be on many occasions.  As I read through this book I said to myself this is my biography.  This is a hillarious romp through the retail stores, visa statements, and job boredom of all our lives.  I recommend this book highly for those of us who want a great laugh out loud book as well as one that makes us take the time to ponder our own lives (although just for a momement before we move on to the next hillarious adventure).  This is a wonderful book for for a fun light read.  A great beach read.
0345446798|5.0|This reads like fiction. It's fascinating, well written and you'll find yourself a lot of AHA moments.... so that's why he does that! I think the description of people is as good as the description of dogs. This was the best book I read all last summer, and I'm an English teacher and read many, many books in summertime. I simply loved it.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Like other trilogies, the third lacks what the first two delivered.  This being said and true, it is still a very good movie.  It is funny and does stay true to the whole &quot;what you thought to be true you will find to be false&quot; character of a trilogy.  Plus, Britney's video in the extras is quite nice as well.  Just sit back and put your brain on pause and enjoy....
0316666343|2.0|I felt almost obligated to read Lovely Bones, as well as to enjoy it.  This is the type of book that could place you in the category of \\"bad person\\" for not liking it.  Well, I guess I'm a bad person, because I think Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones amounted to force-fed sentimentality and strange plot elements.  <br />If you're not crying after the first startlingly, and admittedly engaging, first chapter, don't worry.  You're given plenty of opportunities to feel heart sick during this tragic story.  As if the rape and murder of a 14 year old girl was not enough to leave a bad taste in your mouth for the remainder of the novel, Sebold pours on one horrible occurence after another, brow-beating the reader into a depressed state of melancholy submission with endless descriptions of the muderer's victims, and manipulative tugs at the reader's inherent sympathy for the victim's family.<br />Worst of all, Sebold further unravels as the plot turns into odd supernaturalism.  When Susie Solomon, who narrates from heaven after her rape and murder, starts invading bodies and playing Casper the ghost it's apparent the storytelling device used by Sebold is a shameless gimick.
B00005JLK1|3.0|I loved the opening of the movie and hated the rest.  It is really only deserving of 1 or 2 stars, but the opening is so original and disturbing that I gave it three.  You can turn it off after that and feel better about the movie than you will if you watch it all the way through.
B00000JZC4|4.0|Filter creates an incredible aura around their music. The riveting sound is incredible, and the quick switches between refrains that are quiet and sullen (\\"I tried to pray... yes, I will give it a shot\\") to more robust and thick chunky riffs (\\"I am a creepy man, I can't believe the things I've done to you\\") are, in my opinion, the hallmark of this group. And, finding my 'Title of Record' CD somewhere in the back corners of my CD collection, I've managed to rediscover a CD that kept me warm for some time during undergrad.<br />Something about Filter is just incredible. Their lyrics are more or less hit-and-miss. They certainly don't compare too favourably to Richard Patrick's former 'band'-mate Trent Reznor and his sonorous and more poetic musings. Overlayed with the music, however, the tunes just 'stick.' I guess that makes the criticism a bit lacklustre since few of us sit down with the lyric sheet to read separate and apart from listening to the actual songs.<br />This album, in particular, is more harmoniously put together. The songs mesh and are worthy of a thorough listen-through. Song to song, until the CD is through.<br />There is something distinctive about Filter. The rich textured vocals, the catchiness of some of the songs, the industrial hints, and the drum machines give off a melody that is sometimes fun and poppy, and sometimes a bit more disturbing.<br />It's why I am glad to have found this old friend again. I'm listening to it right now, sitting at the library, writing this review. Honestly! (\\"no cop, no fun, I don't care... Every one of you could be the same, every one of you could play this game...\\" and so on). It's a keeper.
B00005JL96|5.0|Funny, Funny, Funny and very touching.  A wonderful movie with a wonderful message.  Everyone can identify with the message in this one.
B000021XR5|5.0|The current rock scene is one of repetitive commercialism, every new band is an effort to imitate last week's popular hit-maker. In this climate it's refreshing to find a band like Stone Temple Pilots who can produce something both artistic in the musical sense and something that simply rocks. Fronted by Scott Weiland, a rock n' roll wildman who moves and grinds on stage in Iggy Pop fashion, STP have proven to stand-out in the popular music scene because of their stunning live shows and excellent music, this is most evident in \\"No. 4,\\" a brilliant collage of experimentation and hard rock theatrics. \\"Down\\" opens the record in a big way, it's an edgy, crunching dose of distorted rock with Weiland delivering some interesting, melodic vocals and lyrics. The band proves here their ability to diversify when they progress from something hard like \\"Down\\" to the more popish, gliding \\"Church On Tuesday.\\" There's also a burning title homage with \\"MC5,\\" named after the notorious wild band who along with Iggy & The Stooges set the stage for Punk. The stand-out songs are the ones who have a wonderful 60's vibe. Weiland is known to be a big fan of classic rock and STP have done notable covers of songs by The Doors, Led Zeppelin and The Beatles, but here they show how they can take the sound those bands pioneered and create their own material with it. Consider \\"Sour Girl,\\" a beautifully-done song about heartbreak with a Beatlesque chorus and lush guitar work. There's also \\"I Got You,\\" another Beatlesque outing with heart and rich arrangements. The masterpiece on the album is \\"Atlanta,\\" a soaring, epic closer with a dreamlike quality and poetic lyrical work. Weiland's vocals stand out here, he shows-off his range and has earned comparisons with Jim Morrison with this track. The orchestral arrangements are lush and the entire song stands out as one of STP's most timeless, classic songs. \\"No. 4\\" proves a band today can still produce music that can last, touch and exhilarate. It takesyou back to the times when bands actually had to produce SONGS and strived for something original. This is an album for anyone who's looking for real modern music and for something that will stick.
B000089A07|5.0|This is wonderfully done and a lot of fun to see how Hannibal was in the beginning.  But to understand it, you actually must see the first two before this one.  The only thing I hated was at the end, Hannibal is told that he has someone wanting to talk with him from the FBI and he asks what is her name.  That really bothered me because at the beginning of Silence of the lambs, we are told that she was not the first agent to talk to him about the crimes.  That is my only complaint.  Other than that, it is a great movie and Hannibal is at the top of his form.

B000084T18|5.0|Since the album Get Rich Or Die Tryin' hit the stores there's been allot of commotion about 50 cent. People are talkin about what a great debut he makes into the world of rap....but if you're a bit better informed, you know 50 has been here quite longer then this album. But its treu to be he first real shot to show the world what he gots. With his own outstanding talent and very special voice and style of rap ans ofcourse backed up by Eminem and Dre (on the production) this album just CAN'T be a misser....and its not.....its a real hit...although 50 is hit more times in his life then he wants i think.......50 has very strong lyrics on this cd, and none of the numbers give you a feelin of....mmm heard this before.....but still you recognize them all as 50 cent numbers.....Real good Stuff....fantastic album.....50 is gonna give us more of this in the future!! G-Unit 4Ever.....
B000003C2U|5.0|great album! this is their best album until 1993 , i think their other 3 albums realese after this one is way betar , but i am not on of many that thinks that way. still this is agreat album by the best band ever , you have to buy this and add it to your colaction.
B000075BFK|5.0|Although the Best rapper ever isnt among us for along time anymore, his music still lives with allot of people. Even people who didnt get anything of the 2pac maddness when he was still alive and nothing of the recent years after his dead, can talk about 2pac, know 2pac and most of them also love/like 2pac. What else can u do after hearing this album. Another classic.....and i think thats fantastic cause the album before this one (Untill The End Of Time) was one of the (except for the Makaveli album) best albums of 2pac released after his death. But Better Dayz is also a great album. Double Cd again.....total of 26 tracks....and there all superb!!!!On the first cd we get more agressive songs and lyrics from pac.....in the hit em up kinda way.....with some more mellow smooth songs in between.....on the second cd we get more songs of pac where he mostly raps about friends, the ghetto, family and life and death.....more mellow and smoother, but still some though and fantastic lyrics. But thats alwayz the big plus with pac.....his lyricaly talent skills....whick amazes me on every album hes on......<BR>So its worth you're money to buy this one if you are looking for a good and special rap-album......2pac lives on 4ever
B000089RVX|5.0|I absolutly LOVE this cd!!! Its the only cd I'v listened to ever since I got it which was around a month ago!! If u like linkin park u will definently like this cd to!!
B00008IXAR|5.0|Simply Red are back with their new album home. And again it's an album of supreme quality. I imediately 'fell in love' when i heard their hit Sunrise for the first time, and i was very curious about the rest of the album. And now that i heard it, i'm over the moon about it. It's really fantastic...and Simply Red proof themselves to be one of the best around in the music business these days.Normally it isn't my number 1 favourite music style, but Simply Red.....i always loved the're sound and i still do !!!
B00003CXXM|4.0|I'll be honest, I haven't read the Robert Ludlum novel, nor do I remember seeing the original film staring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith. So I'm not able to point out differences or inconsistencies, if indeed there are any. Having said that, I can't imagine its predecessors topping Doug Liman's version of \\"The Bourne Identity.\\" This is the sort of film I like to watch pretty often and each time I find something new to enjoy.<br /><br />The plot, while nothing very original, provides a useful framework around which we get to enjoy some of the most believable action sequences I've seen. Let's face it, an assassin suffering from amnesia is not going to lead a dull life, particularly not after his \\"friends\\" decide he's gone rogue. There's only so many ways you can film stunts and action sequences like a car chase but Liman has  managed to somehow make the many action scenes seem fresh. I particularly liked seeing what looked like a mini-minor out driving the police using skill and good planing, rather than a high-powered engine or death-defying jumps.<br /><br />Most of the movie follows Jason Bourne, (Matt Damon), as he tries to reclaim his life and survive to see each new day. In this way, the audience is allowed to discover the pieces of the puzzle along with him. On the way he forms an unequal partnership with Marie Kreutz, (Franka Potente). It is good to see a female lead portrayed without either weakness or an unrealistic macho streak. Hopefully, this film will launch Franka's Hollywood career because she has more than earned her stripes in German cinema.<br /><br />Jason and Marie inevitably bond but despite not taking a major part of the narrative, I felt their stop-start romance suited the film. Perhaps a woman with no home makes a good match for a man with no past. I also liked the several times the couple tried to split up, to  get Marie out of Bourne's troubles but I especially liked the realism when they finally managed to part. The plot really doesn't need her but it seems Liman used Marie as a means of reminding Bourne that there is more to life than survival.<br /><br />To some it would be nice to wake up one day and discover you were a sort of superman; able to speak half a dozen languages, had tens of thousands in a Swiss bank account and could out-fight Bruce Lee. His boss said it best when he described Jason as a $30,000,000 weapon. But more than advanced skills, Jason was gifted with intelligence and the experience of years of spy craft, even if he couldn't remember it. The thoughtful approach taken to achieve each objective, even on the spur of the moment, made the film almost educational. Hey, read a map before running from the police, use distraction and decoys to sidetrack you opponent, use the resources around you and think laterally. It's all good stuff for budding spies.<br /><br />While Matt Damon played the part with little emotion, deliberately I assume, some of the smaller roles were outstanding. Each seemed to wring so  much depth from so few minutes of screen time that I felt like watching a spin-off movie for each of them. Probably the most affecting was the performance of Clive Owen, a fellow assassin who dies describing his constant headaches and bitter loneliness. Also of note is Julia Stiles, the overworked safe-house administrator; she exudes competence while com­plaining of limited resources. All of these perform­ance gems must be a credit to Liman's direction.<br /><br />It would be easy to dismiss \\"The Bourne Identity\\" as just another action flick. The action was great, but the true heart of the film was Jason's odyssey to reclaim his soul from the depths of a CIA black-ops hell. He used to be an amoral machine, doing his job without questioning the rightness of his work, just like the rest of them. But amnesia gave him the chance to step back from the abyss and evaluate his fate, eventually choosing to tear a new path into the future. The moral? Perhaps it's that \\"freedom\\" is more important than \\"patriotism.\\"
B000003N7K|5.0|It is difficult to write a review of a piece of art like this.  Words just don't do it justice.  The emotions conveyed on this relatively short record (about thirty minutes) alone are enough to take you to a higher place.<br />Everybody's playing on this record is about as good as it can get.  Hartman's voice is incredible; he floats on top of the melody, he gets deep inside the groove, he sings behind the notes, he tap dances with Elvin Jones' brush.  Coltrane's playing is simply beautiful; there is no other word for it.  All you can sometimes do is just cry at how ethereal, spiritual, and calmly reinforcing his playing is.<br />McCoy Tyner's piano playing is sublime; it's like watching a zen master float through the air or something.<br />Jimmy Garrison's bass playing; I don't have the words.  It is so good that I don't notice he's there WHILE I AM COMPLETELY AWARE AT ALL TIMES WHAT HE IS DOING IN THE MUSIC.  It is an accomplishment of such gravity that I shudder just at the thought of it.<br />In the end it is the sum of the parts, not the parts themselves that matter.  The players here are collectively committed to not just playing at a high level but they are simply out of their bodies and minds here. This is a true piece of art that will be even better 500 years from now.
0451169514|5.0|For me, It ranks right up next to The Stand as my favorite King books. Once again the master of modern fiction takes us on an epic tale of horror and suspense, including the most bizzare boogeyman I think he's ever created. As other reviewers have already discussed the plot and the characters, just let me add in a few notes on what I got out of this book. <br />The character development is top-notch. King goes into so much detail (sometimes too much!) that you can't help but to fall in love with these kids. Then, on top of that, King masterfully mixes the adult version of the kids with their youth, so it doesn't read like a two part novel. He bounces back and forth alot, kind of explaining things as he goes. <br />This is not a book for the light of heart and people who shy away from books any thicker than an inch. In fact, the hardback version of this book could probably be registered as a lethal weapon in some states! But if you really like reading and great storytelling, this book will keep you entertained for many, many hours. I consider myself a pretty quick reader, slightly above average, and it took me well over 24 hours to devour this behemoth. But the time spent was well worth it and I certainly couldn't claim that I didn't get my money's worth. <br />Get this book. Be scared!
B000060P79|3.0|I am a fan of the pop/punk genre, and a friend of mine recommended this CD to me.  I went online, listened to the snippets, and decided to get it.  Unfortunately, it was a bit of a waste of my fifteen bucks.<br />This album is incredibly poppy, probably the most so in my collection.  It's a very good album for Avril fans who want to progress onto \\"harder\\" (hah) stuff, but not great for people with my music tastes (my favorite, and very cool, bands include Midtown, Sugarcult, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink182, MxPx, etc).  <br />Pierre's voice is very juvenile and high, but, unlike Jordan from New Found Glory (who has about the same voice range), he often gets annoying.  You just kind of want to make him shut up.  The musicianship is nothing great--not horrible, but not masterfully done either.  The lyrics sound kind of like a very G-rated Blink182--however, taking away the gross, raunchy factor which makes Blink so much fun just leaves some kind of dull slush.  I honestly hope that Simple Plan wrote these songs, and didn't hire a lyricist to write them.  Otherwise, the lyricist should be shot for daring to be a \\"professional\\".  Also, in my opinion, the backup vocals and Pierre's voice don't really blend well.<br />Granted, this band has some good points.  \\"Perfect\\" is a nice, sad song with a good chorus.  And I've heard they're awesome live.  Unfortunately, they're touring with Avril Lavigne, who stinks live (or so I've heard).  <br />Overall, this is a very poppy \\"punk\\" band, who has a very manufactured song.  For TRL listeners, this is a good CD if you want \\"harder\\" stuff than what normally plays on the radio.  However, for people who like Blink182 and harder pop-punk, try Good Charlotte's CD The Young and the Hopeless.  That CD is much better lyrically and musically than this one, and well worth your money.
B0000009SY|5.0|There is something on this album for everyone.  Blues, Rock, Metal, Jazz, Reggae, Funk, Folk, and not only hints of these musical themes, all the songs are gritty, tongue in cheek style that demands listening attention.  Fused with some of the most hilarious lyrics I've ever heard.  Personally I think its more comical then \\"Were Only In It For The Money\\", but not as merciless as far as social commentary.  But this doesn't pull any punches either.  The first disc is more tightly composed compositions that only Zappa could do, and the second disc seems to be more of his musical experimentation with the long guitar solo's that are simply amazing.  This album is definitive Frank Zappa.  A must have for any music collection.

B00005YW4H|5.0|As a jaded, been there listened to that, 36 year old, semi-professional jazz musician, I was astonished to find myself instantly and utterly transfixed by Norah's music when she first came to the UK. This does not happen to me any more than once in a decade and it certainly never happens with music that it so heavily indebted to the country tradition. Yet there I was, almost beside myself with joy.<br />From a musician's perspective, her control, tone, intonation, timing and the sheer beauty of her presentation are extraordinary, but, far more importantly, Ms Jones manages to reach those areas of emotional understanding that touch the very depths of what it means to be human. This is a life affirming album of the utmost quality. Without any hint of pretentiousness, restrained, cultured and yet bristling with that raw energy and passion that can only come from a potent cocktail of youth and immense talent, Norah Jones encapsulates the real meaning of jazz as a lifestyle, rather than a form of music.<br />Greater versatility and a few more years will be needed before serious comparisons can be made, but I genuinely believe that Norah Jones has the potential to achieve true greatness. Not the kind of `pop' greatness reserved for the likes of Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston, but the true musical greatness of a Billie Holiday or Ella Fitzgerald.<br />I feel privileged to be part of a world in which such beauty is available for all to hear.

B000001FKY|5.0|I am only 16 years old, but i have been lysting to Def Leppard sence i was only 2 years old. In March i went to see them in concert, and what a show. They played about 4 or 5 songs from Hysteria. They were all way cool. If you think about the sound of the album, there is no better Hard Rock album. All the songs are loud. This makes my Top 3 Album as number 1. Its a way cool album, with a picture with them in concert, with what looks like 200,000 or more people at the concert. and there is a small story about what the band went through. then in the back there is a book for sale, but dont send the check or money order, the book is out of print. ... if you buy enjoy.

B00005JKHN|5.0|My grandmother owned movie theaters in Pittsburgh when I was a boy, and I went to the movies every weekend. I got to see all of the Disney classics, but Sleeping Beauty was, far and away, Disney's finest hour. The colors screamed off of the screen, and were at their best when the fairies were \\"warring\\" over what color to make Aroura's birthday dress. The fairies themselves were incredibly fun to watch & listen to, but the real star of the film was the most evil of all Disney's bad guys: Maleficent. When she laughs, your blood crawls. And when she turns into a dragon, the graphics are amazing.<br />I can only imagine what the restoration process will do to the colors in this movie, but if the restoration of \\"Snow White\\" is any indication, then the relaease on DVD of Sleeping Beauty will be the masterpiece of all animated films.<br />I can NOT wait until September for the release of this film. Even my kids are salavating at the thought of having this in our family DVD library.
0385504209|5.0|This book is such an amazing, page-turning thriller that I read it only in two days! It reminded me a lot of &quot;Conquest of Paradise&quot;, another religious thriller I couldn't put down.  Both books kept me up late at night reading, unable to stop! This is defintily one of my favorite books, along with &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; (another Dan Brown). As with all of Brown's novels, as soon as you think you have the book all figured out, keep reading and he throws a curve-ball at you. Not only was the book exciting and excellent, but it was also intellectually engaging. Definitly recommended - a perfect book with the exception of the irrelevant title.
B00008BRBG|4.0|As I listened to &quot;Outlandos&quot; on my iPod last night, after I dutifully purchased all of the newly remastered editions on CD, I felt the need to wax rhapsodic.<BR>Listening to these impossibly crisp and detailed recordings, I remembered, as if it was yesterday, buying the LP.  After &quot;Ghost In The Machine&quot;, I had become a monstrous Police fan. I lived and breathed the Police. I went back and bought their first three records, and proceeded to memorize them.<BR>This will not be an unbiased review.<BR>I made a copy of the LP, on a cassette tape, Years later, when CDs came out, I repurchased the Police catalog, as I have with each remastering. The box set goes without saying.  VHS tapes, laserdiscs, and now DVD's. I have listened to them in every conceivable media.<BR>As the million-miles-an-hour &quot;Next To You&quot; opened the album, I was taken back to my high school and early college days. These guys were supposed to be punk, or punk-ish, but like The Clash, they threw more sounds...more textures into the mix. Sting occasionally sings with a tonsil-thrashing punk howl, but the airy voice always reverts to a classic melody some time before the final chorus. Andy Summers' guitars sounded like no one else at the time, and Stewart Copeland's polyphonic drumming put him head-and-shoulders above the DIY crowd.<BR>Calming myself down just a bit, I must admit this is NOT a perfect record. &quot;Masoko Tanga&quot; sounds like three guys messing around in a studio with a tape running. The &quot;Sally&quot; interlude is funny the first few times, then gets kinda tedious. &quot;Hole In My Life&quot; is too long. <BR>Who cares? &quot;Next To You&quot;, &quot;So Lonely&quot; and the stone-cold-classic the first-time-you-heard-it &quot;Roxanne&quot; open the album in a way few debuts ever have. An instantly recognizable, commercial yet edgy, punk yet not punk, individual and unique, defiant statement proclaiming their arrival.<BR>&quot;Peanuts&quot; ends side one in a manic flurry.<BR>I could go on, about comparing the near-delicate guitar sounds in &quot;So Lonely&quot; to the beefy thrash in parts of &quot;Born In The 50s&quot;, about the reggae-ification of beats that twisted conventional tunes into extraordinary ones, the nimble bass...<BR>And this was just the beginning. The first of only five albums. The Police lit up the pop world for half a decade and then split. The three of them apart were never as potent as the three of them together, but seeing them together at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony offered us a delicious, delirious reminder of their talent.
B00006JDVV|4.0|I love mankind.  I love dragons.  I love well-told apocalyptic stories.  So where do I go for entertainment?  To Reign of Fire, of course!  On the DVD the short about making the film was almost more fun than the movie itself.  Human beings are a special breed of animal but we are basically helpless without our tools and gadgets and intellect.  And sometimes we awaken forces that ought not be disturbed.  I enjoy watching mankind being taken down a peg because it has always been adversity that shows us at our best.  The rule is simple: get lazy, get fat, get eaten.  Makes sense to me.  The characterizations are a bit muddy, having been sacrificed to the action; but that's ok because the action is spectacular.  And there are surprises and tongue-in-cheek fun around every pile of rock.  Don't watch this movie to learn anything.  Ignore most of the dialogue and macho male posturing; just enjoy watching a bunch of humans devise a plan to save the earth, again.  Oh yeah, and remember that it pays to &quot;call before you dig&quot;!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from these \\"lesbian posers\\" but I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to the album. The super-addictive \\"all the things she said\\" really got to me so I bought the CD. There's some pretty good stuff on here despite their high-pitched singing. Tracks like \\"not gonna get us\\", \\"show me love\\" and \\"stars\\" are really well done. <br />On the other hand 200KM/H IN THE WRONG LANE IS a really short CD with only 8 songs. The other 3 tracks are Russian versions of \\"all the things she said\\", \\"not gonna get us\\" and an extended version of \\"show me love\\". Lyrically this CD deals with gay love. Even the straight forward \\"malchik gay\\" deals with being in love with a gay boy. <br />Despite Lena & Julia's girl-on-girl gimmick, 200KM IN THE WRONG LANE is worth checking out.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I've long been a fan of both electronic and folk/acoustic music.  I'm so pleased to see Madonna combining the two.  As David Gray and Folk Implosion have demonstrated, it can be a great combination.  This is a really nice CD with some lovely melodies.  While I've heard many say its unaccessible, I find it to be one of her more accessible albums.  America has become such a success, because people work hard for success.  However, we are beginning to reach a point where success has a one dimensional definition--material success.  We often allow love and family to fall a distant second.  This CD seems to have its finger on the cultural pulse by recognizing and addressing this problem.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I've been a fan of Miyazaki films long before I became a fan of Japanese animation. Miyazaki always seems to be able to tap into the themes we all recognize and while weaving into it surprise and the sense of the fantastic, grounds it firmly in the way life really works.  <br />When Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke) came out in 2000 and blew me away, it seemed to be the culmination of all the excellent work Studio Ghibli had come out with over the years, such as My Neighbor Totoro, and Nausicaa, Valley of the Wind, seamlessly merging new technology with traditional animation methods and of course, a wonderful, haunting soundtrack. I was wondering how long it would be til the next Miyazaki masterpiece came out, and how it would up the ante again on animated features and storytelling.<br />This year Miyazaki pulls through again with his gift of adding truth to fiction in the way he really cares about how little girls really behave, and gives many of his characters unique subtle mannerisms that round them out and make them much more real to us. However he also breaks the Ghibli heroine's mold with 10-year old Chihiro, who is pouty, whiny, scared and having difficulty adjusting to moving to a new place.  Not a tough, self-sufficient girl like Nausicaa, or San from Mononoke Hime, nor is she sweet or pretty like Sheeta in Castle in the Sky.<br />However. Miyazaki proves to us that even snub-nosed, spoiled 10-year old girls can grow up to be rather likeable people, and Chihiro, despite the odds, manages to wade through her fears and selfishness to come out much wiser and a little less selfish and afraid in the end.  While it seems nothing else has changed and life goes on, Chihiro keeps for herself the gifts she gets from the experience, even if no one else knows about Yubaba, the bath house, or Haku.<br />I believe it's worth getting the DVD because apart from the merits of the film itself, the DVD allows us to look into the work that went into the creation of Spirited Away inside both Disney and Studio Ghibli, from the English Dubbing to the sleepless nights the animation crew worked through to meet their deadline, to the creation of the soundtrack.  Disney did a good job dubbing this film in English but I am particularly grateful for the fact that they added in the option to watch the film in the original Japanese track with English subtitles.
B00005NP04|5.0|I, like one another reviewer here, am commenting solely on Martina's song &quot;Concrete Angel,&quot; available on this album. I can tell you right now that I have never heard anything that's come even close to this. It is so touching and it hit me so hard, I feel a sort of pain inside when I hear it. Martina sings this song absolutely beautifully, too--no singer has ever sounded more beautiful in a song than this. Martina truly hits home with &quot;Concrete Angel,&quot; and I hope it is heard for years to come. People need to hear this song--it spoke volumes to me the first time I heard it 2 days ago. The entire price of the CD is worth it for this single song. I've heard the others on there and they're beautiful too (&quot;Valentine&quot;), but &quot;Angel&quot; is truly a standout, an accomplishment of Martina's to be cherished.<br />God bless our children.
0141301155|5.0|Fact: Roald Dahl is an amazing author with tons of great books under his belt.  <BR>With that said, if you're going to embark into the world of Dahl, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" has to be your first read.  While I do think some of Dahl's other books such as \\"Matilda\\" or \\"The BFG\\" are better, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" shows the brilliance of Dahl.  <BR>Most of us know the general story of this book.  A young, poor boy who wins the oppertunity to tour the Wonka factory, discovering a magical world hidden within it's walls.  You have to know a story is good when it inspires not only a movie, but a candy company.  <BR>I love how this book paints each charecter and scene without overloading the reader with details.  The reader feels like they are right beside Charlie, touring the factory with him.  <BR>At the end the real reason to the tour is explained in a touching way that leaves the reader feeling that no matter what your background may be, anything is possible if you dream big enough.  And if you ask me, this is a message every kid needs to hear these days.
0688163173|1.0|While I can't be certain, I am fairly sure that Lehane is trying to write with the depth and imagination of Thomas Cook--both in Shutter Island and in his previous novel, Mystic River. Lehane can write coherently, but he really doesn't have anything to say. Mystic River was boring and Shutter Island &quot;appears&quot; to be somewhat exciting, but if you read carefully it is really quite dull.  Just writing about a weird island where outrageously insane people are treated doesn't make a persuasive novel. I found the ending highly predictable. Lehane could have written this novel in one sentence: &quot;There are crazy people in this world who are not amenable to medical treatment.&quot;
B00003CX8J|3.0|I remember walking about of the theatre the first time I saw this movie. The first thing that came to my mind was \\"Wow! The sequels are going to be awesome!\\" A lot like how the Empire Strikes Back was an alright movie, but let's face it, it was really just a long hype up for Return of the Jedi. <BR>While being a great movie, X-Men has the problem many movies have. A great story with a lot of things left out, unexplained, or that could have been fixed. I never read the comic books growing up, but listening to my friends who did, I had enough knowledge to wonder why they never covered Storm's claustraphobia when she was in the elevator shaft, or why Rogue was so young. <BR>Then there's Halle Berry for Storm. I know, \\"she's sooooo hot!!\\" But she's not that great of an actor in this movie. Expecially when you give her an accent. She looks the part, but the director needed to work with her some more. Expecially when it comes to her lines. I've never met anyone who's disagreed that her line to Toad when she fries him has to be one of the dumbest lines in movie history. And when they were trying to save Rogue, why couldn't she fly up to her? SHE CAN FLY!! Perhaps I just had a problem with her portrayal of Storm.  I'm used to the bold...Storm and not one that looks scared or sad all the time.<BR>As other have said, Sabertooth was a [softy.]And Toad!? He's the dumbest villian in the whole series. At least they got him out of the way early. <BR>Finally there's Jean Grey. Great role, but needed a hotter actress. Not to be picky, but I HAVE seen how she's drawn in the comics. They just didn't portray her well enough. <BR>But now that that's all out of my system, I will say that the rest of the movie was great. It made me quite excited for the sequel. Hugh Jackman is perfect as Wolverine.  Before I saw the movie I thought the biggest challenge would be making Wolverine's hair look normal.  And no one other than Patrick Stewart would work for Professior X.    <BR>Again, this is agreat movie with a few flaws.  Perhaps they'll fix all them in the sequel knowing people will go see it. <BR>As for me, I feel like such a nerd...I'm gonna go shower. I feel dirty.
B000084T18|5.0|The diamond of rap 50cent. 50 cent is the greatest since Tupac and B.I.G and he has proved that through his latest album Get Rich or Die Trying. My favorite song Many Men, the words are great and the beat oh!! two thumbs up.<BR>    For a man who has been shot 9 times its unbelievable and for him to express it through song thats incredible. 50 cent thats his name and he does'nt back down. \\"I LOVE IT!\\" \\"keep up the good work and there will always be people like me supporting you all the way,\\" cause he has shown bravery and courage when everyone knows that he has alot of haters out there. 50 cent dont back down and just remember youre loved also in the Caribbean(st.lucia) LOVE YA!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie.  I had heard how great it was, how great the cast was, how great the music was, etc.  What I got was a completely unoriginal movie.  <BR>It was yet another boy meets girl, girl can't be with boy since she's forced to be with someone else.  Perhaps they were trying to capitolize off of the success of movies like \\"The Princess Bride,\\" which had the same theme (though far from the same plot.)  To make it even less original, the songs are not even there own.  Most of them are ..of popular songs.  <BR>I stuck with it though.  I kept watching thinking that soon it would all make sense.  Perhaps at the end someone would wake up and talk about how that was the weirdest dream they'd ever had.  Something like that.  But no.  At the end the viewer is left wondering, \\"is that it?\\"  I remember back to scenes such as when some guy with a gun gets tackled, the gun flies out the window and hits the Eifel Tower.  I'm sorry, but did I miss some sort of strange symbolizim here?  <BR>In the end I was left with the same feeling I get when I have too much Pop-Rocks and Rootbeer.  Just another foamy, queezy stomach ache.  <BR>The only reason for people liking this movie that I could think of was peer pressure.  All the reviewers talked about how great it was, some artsy-fartsy people said it was great, and then it was a great game of telephone until the majority of people liked it.  Fight peer pressure people.  Don't be afraid to say how boring this movie was.<BR>I pray they don't make a sequel.
B00005U122|5.0|I've read a cross section of the reviews posted here and I agree with most of them.  I did attend the concert and I was just absolutely in awe of the talent on stage.  When I saw the DVD come out I had to have it, although I thought I would be dissapointed by sound quality and production as I have been on several other DVD concerts.  BOY WAS I WRONG !!!  This (at the time) was the best sound I had ever heard from a concert DVD, if your a home theatre type of person you will REALLY enjoy this DVD, it's a marvel of sight and sound.  If you're a Floyd/Waters fan you'll love the concert.  What a great collection of songs !!<BR>( I won't waste space listing them ) The energy is contagious !<BR>I wasn't a big fan of his solo stuff until after I saw this concert, I'm now a fan.  This isn't the type of DVD that sits on your shelf and you never watch, you'll watch this one over and over again.
0312263120|4.0|I thought this was a great E-book. Very fast paced with many plot twists and turns. The book does have it's moments where your wondering why these \\"super smart\\" agents can't put two and two together. However if your not going in to this book with an over-critical mindset, I think it's a great story. I find the plot to be unique and the writing very witty. Being that this was Dan Brown's first book, I'm satisfied with the value. <br />After reading this, I'm looking forward to reading some of his other books. What is so great about Dan's books is that he gives your factual information in a fictional story. While reading you are being moved along in this story, but also picking up these interesting tidbits about the government, NSA, code-breaking, and other subjects. If you are remotely interested in learning things which are somewhat \\"secretive\\", I suggest picking this up or checking out another one of his books.

B00005JLXE|5.0|Daredevil was an awesome Marvel film.  I was never a huge fan of the comic although I am a big Spider-Man and Hulk fan.  I'm not even a Ben Afleck fan.  However, the movie Daredevil exceeded expectations for the simple reasons that others have cited - namely, it was a bit darker than most superhero movies and kept the cutsey-wootsey dialogue to a minimum.  The action sequences were very impressive too.  Those who complain about Daredevil beging able to jump need to realize that the *comic book* was deficient in that respect.  I could never believe in Daredevil because without any enhanced strength, he shouldn't be able to roam around the city.  The movie corrected that.
B00005R62N|5.0|According to a recent JP documentary, Rob's vocals disappeared in the original recording due to faulty equipment. So he redid them in a single take in the studio later, while all the instrumental sound is completely live. Whether this is \\"live\\" enough for the purists is a different matter, but it makes no difference to me. My only problem with this album is that it is too short! Every song is a classic, the sound is gorgeous and, due to Rob's microphone failure, we are spared the silly between-song banter that plague many otherwise superb live metal albums. I, for one, do not miss hearing l(...) platitudes of \\"how we're really gonna party tonight\\" or that \\"(city name) really rocks\\". Check out the Scorpions' \\"World Wide Live\\" for particularly egregious examples of this obnoxious behaviour.<br />This album, on the other hand, has no flaws (perhaps apart from the dodgy cover photos). With the reissue providing four extra tracks, there is no excuse for any metal fan for not having it prominently displayed in the CD collection.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Update: Since I wrote my first review, I have had a change of heart about Madonna's new album. While I still feel this album is nowhere near the greatness that \\"Ray Of Light\\" was. \\"American Life\\" is a wonderful album that grows on you with each listen. I still think some of the lyrics are \\"laughable and out of touch\\", but once I thought about what she was saying, everything started to make sense to me. I also think that she needs to change her producer, because the music is becoming stale. Vocally, I must say that her simple vocals forced me to pay attention to her songs. She doesn't sound awful...I take back what I said on my first review. Madonna is the best and 100 years from now, people will still be talking about her, her work, and how she changed the world. What an artist!! What a woman!! What an American!!<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR> Let me say this...Madonna's American Life is the worst album of her career. This album is sooo bad because now, it appears that Madonna is starting to believe her own hype. Where \\"Ray Of Light\\" revealed her soul and \\"Music\\" revealed parts of her life, Madonna now feels that she must \\"preach\\" to us about what is important and what's not. The funny thing is, most of what she is saying is common sense. There is nothing brilliant or uncommon about her views. But to hear Madonna say it makes me laugh. Some of the things she says show just how far remove she is from everyday life. Check out the single \\"American Life\\" where she talks about having 3 nannies and things like that. Most of us can't imagine living that life, so to hear her preach to us about that makes the single unbearable to listen to. The music and the production also hit a low note. Everything sounds bland or recycled. Again on her previous two releases, she experiments on sounds and production. But on this project, she doesn't. Also she sounds awful. She has never been a powerhouse vocalist, but now she is trying to sing \\"proper\\". I respect the message she is trying to bring because it's needed, but I suggest that she sticks to what she is best known for. \\"American Life\\" will not cut it for me now or ever.
B00008VGK0|5.0|This is definitely a must for the collector. Missy and Oakenfold mixes are the best for an American Life. I've never understood why so many like Felix Da House Cat ( or what ever ) however there is something to be said for his effort here. The true Gem on this disc is the remix for Die Another Day, it seems to outlast the outstanding Dirty Vegas remix on it's own CD single. A true house tune for the dancefloor culture as well as living room (a top the coffee table) entertainment. Sorry Felix, your stuff just doesn't move anything and all sounds the same. A signature sometimes leaves you with the wanting of something more or better. The Peter R mixes are just plain pointless. As a fan of Mrs. Ritchie and the approval of at least three outstanding mixes I have to say it's a 5 star release. I'd like to see Madonna do some experimenatl mixes with trip hop and maybe some drum & bass.
B000002KZA|5.0|Well, I don't know where to begin but I just want to say that &quot;Construction Time Again&quot; is a totally amazing album from start to finish. <br />This is a far cry away from the darker tone of their famous albums but also a far cry from the sunny dance pop of their debut &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot;. To me, this is an absolutely great thing and I love every song on this CD. <br />This has a highly experimental production to it and bridges the pop of their previous two albums and the gloom of their following albums after this one. &quot;Shame&quot; is an absolutely awesome mid-tempo song with an odd sense of humor in it and a dark but not bleak or cold atmosphere. I think of the song &quot;Shame&quot; as more of a stroll down the block on a cloudy evening. <br />Must I say that I even like &quot;Pipeline&quot;. I'm probably the rare people who actually enjoys this song even though it's my least favorite on the album. <br />Who can forget their first major anthem &quot;Everything Counts&quot;. I jsut love the carnival sounds in the song. The two versions sound almsot exactly the same except for that the regular (running at 4:24) fades out where as the longer (at 7:19) version stops. That's about the only difference between the songs. <br />Overall, this is an aboslutely fabulous album. A must-have even for lazier fans.

B000006FYP|5.0|I may be the only person on the Earth that thinks Val Kilmer made a much better combination of Batman and Bruce Wayne than Michael Keaton. While Keaton may have made a good Batman, he was non-believable as Bruce Wayne, coming off more like a short order cook that inherited his favorite rich customer's mansion than a true spoiled, preppy, rich kid. Kilmer was as good as Keaton as Batman, but MUCH more believable as Bruce Wayne, lifelong polo player and prep school bunky.<br /><br />That major point aside, this movie was vastly different from the preceding two films. The set design was more busy, the tone of the production a good mix of the campy spirit of the old TV show and and the darker, but still humorous spirit of \\"Batman Returns\\". Like \\"Returns\\", this one is much more substantial than the first, offering more visual and storyline hooks and, with the exception of the disappointing Tommy Lee Jones, better acting and casting.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones. Will somebody kindly tell me how 1) Harvey Dent changed races in two movies and 2) Became an even LAMER character as played by Jones? This role should have been eaten up by an actor of Jones' caliber, but he chose to play it almost exactly like the slumming pros did in the campy old TV show. Just think what a Richard Burton or a Rutger Hauer could have done with the role, or what even Billy Dee Williams could have done with it.<br /><br />With Schumacher's take on this franchise, Gotham City takes on a much more metropolitan look and feel. It seems more like a real city and some of the camera work is truly awesome. I've nicknamed one scene \\"The dolly shot from Hell\\" because of the length and thrills involved. This is the scene where Kilmer, as Batman, leaps off of a ledge to follow Two-Face underground after he \\"crashes\\" Edward Nygma's party. A lot of people badmouth Schumacher, and after seeing \\"Batman & Robin\\", maybe they're right, but in this movie, he could do little wrong.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman is good as Chase Meridian, a love interest named after two bank chains. She can't make up her mind about Bruce OR Batman and vacillates between the two. Their scenes together are full of coy, forties-style banter that could be uttered by Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. Though there doesn't seem to be any REAL chemistry here, it still has more then the pairing of Basinger and Keaton in the first one.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is the one that grabs your attention, though, as Edward Nygma/The Riddler. You shake your head that this living cartoon wasn't more marketable in 1988 when he was first starting and the first Batman movie was released....he would have been THE actor to play The Joker, (though I still wonder why Tim Curry was never given that role!) The manic energy he puts into the role makes him remind you of every insane, four-eyed geek you ever knew in high school who succeeded in spite of himself. \\"Over the top\\" doesn't begin to describe his performance.<br /><br />The BIG surprise here, though, is Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin. This could have easily been handled sappily by Schumacher, but O'Donnell plays Grayson very \\"J.D. Salinger\\" and he actually turns out to be one of the better elements of the movie. Along with Carrey, he gives one of the best performances in the film. The scene where Grayson wrings out his laundry in front of Alfred is one of the most effective in the movie.<br /><br />An odd element, and perhaps the one that reminds one most of the old TV show, is the presence of two henchwomen for Two-Face, played by Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, representing his good and evil sides. They're both played campily and ever-so-slightly over the top, especially Mazar, and usually accompany Two-Face to his less dangerous jobs.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is STUFFED! It has action out the wazoo, bridges two interpretations of the Batman aesthetic quite nicely, has good performances, (Kilmer's, O'Donnell's and Carrey's especially,) and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Frankly, I think this is the Star Trek VI of the Batman franchise...full of life and effective with it!<br /><br />Highly recommended.f the Batman franchise...full of life and effective with it!    Highly recommended.
B00006LPER|5.0|This film is outstanding, but I can't imagine the general public liking this movie. I'm in the classical music world and understand the music conservatory life. All the acting is wonderful. I would say not to watch this movie if you really don't know the music world and not like kinky stuff. I do understand why some people get bored with this. But to me I can really feel how my life would be over if my teacher put glass in my coat pocket to injure my hands so I'll never play again! That was the most terrible part for me to watch!<br />Trust your own judgement. If you don't like the plot, the music is beautiful and they use great musicians.

0060922583|5.0|The book not only provides a perspective of looking at the universe as holographic, but also provides an avalanche of very interesting stories.<br />As a Clinical Hypnotherapist, and a firm believer that there are no limitations to what we can experience and the changes we can create in our bodies and in our lives, even on genetic level, I wanted to share one of the stories from this book:<br />\\"Brocq's disease involves a horribly disfiguring hereditary condition.  Victims of Brocq's disease develop a thick, horny covering over their skin that resembles the scales of a reptile.  The skin can become so hardened and rigid that even the slightest movement will cause it to crack and bleed. <br />Brocq's disease was incurable until 1951 when a sixteen-year-old boy with an advanced case of the affliction was referred as a last resort to a hypnotherapist named A.A. Mason at the Queen Victoria Hospital in London.  Mason discovered that the boy was a good hypnotic subject and could easily be put into a deep state of trance.<br />While the boy was in trance, Mason told him that his Brocq's disease was healing and would soon be gone.  Five days later the scaly layer covering the boy's left arm fell off, revealing soft, healthy flesh beneath.  By the end of tend days the arm was completely normal.<br />Mason and the boy continued to work on different body areas until all of the scaly skin was gone.  The boy remained symptom-free for at least five years, at which point Mason lost touch with him.<br />This is extraordinary because Brocq's disease is a genetic condition, and getting rid of it involves more than just controlling autonomic processes such as blood flow patterns and various cells of the immune system.  It means tapping into the masterplan, the DNA programming itself.  So, it would appear that when we access the right strata of our beliefs, our minds can override even our genetic makeup.\\"
B00000DF6O|5.0|Shuffle tunes Tell Me Baby, Mean Old World and Broken Promise are worth the money by themselves, and if you don't &quot;get&quot; those, you're dead or you should be shopping for something other than blues records. What a band. What grooves. What definitive blues guitar. What singing. What production. There are a couple of less-than-perfect endings on this collection, but so what? They could have gone back and prettied them up, but they didn't because the point of this project seems to be that there is no substitute for good, live music.
B00006F83Y|3.0|This is a great album.  However, it is not nearly as good as the first two QOTSA albums.  There was something lost between Rated R and this album.  If you have never bought an album of theirs, this is not the one to begin with, for the reason you might not appreciate the first two.  I believe Dave Grohl's drumming was more detremental than helpful to the cohesion of this albums sound.  And if your not sick of the first track yet, just listen to it 3 times in a row and it will be ruined.

B000022TSH|4.0|Since this classic has been reviewed by so many others, I thought I would focus more on the DVD itself.  It was released in 1999 to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the film but being new to the DVD world, I just purchased it recently.<BR> <BR>1) The print is great and the sound crystal clear. Considering I only had a VHS copied from Cinemax over 10 years ago and the commerical ridden version on AMC to tide me over the last few years, it was wonderful to see the film in letterbox format. I originally saw this film in a giant, single screen grand theatre back in 1974, before the attack of the multi-plexes, and watching the DVD on a big-screen tv brought back those memories quickly. All I was missing was the wood-back, poorly cushioned seat.   So from that standpoint, the DVD gets 5 stars.<br />2) Scene selection - Unfortunately, the DVD falls short here. There are only 15 or so scene selections and when the average DVD contains about 2 dozen, I figure somewhere along the way,  cost was a factor. I know this is a nit-pick kind of thing but Chinatown is filled with snippets of great scenes and I can't always get to the points I want to without hitting the fast forward button in addition to the skip. I would think just about every \\"fade to black\\" occurence, and this movie contains many, could have been a selection.   Sorry, as a fan who enjoys just watching some of the classic lines/scenes (\\"....and I like breathing through it...\\", \\"...to tell you the truth, I lied a little...\\"), I feel shortchanged. Rate 2.5 stars. <br />3) There is an interview with the three biggest \\"behind the scenes\\" participants, producer Robert Evans, writer Robert Towne, and director Roman Polanski. Although there are a few tidbits of fun trivia(the name of the other actress the studio apparently wanted instead of Dunaway, Polanski pointing out an \\"incorrect technicality\\" of a scene where Gittes is snapping a picture) the interviews seemed short and fell a little short of my expectations. Iguess I was expecting something along the lines of the documentary PBS did years ago about great mystery films. \\"Chinatown\\" was dissected and it was much more in depth. For example, something pointed out then that I never noticed and has made me appreciate the film even more over the years was how Polanski shot many scenes from behind Gittes, over his shoulder. The idea was to bring the viewer into the film almost as a character standing behind Gittes. We discover things as he does. The scene where Gittes discovers the body of Ida Sessions was discussed in great detail. To me, this is one of the \\"little things\\" that make this film a classic.  I imagine there must have been a good reason why none of the actors were part of the interviews.  I mean this film was rated number 19 on the AFI greatest films of all time list and you would think someone would appreciate that enough to participate. Dunaway once wrote about about how Nicholson was upset when shooting a scene interfered with him watching a Laker game.  I guess I wanted to hear that story verbally.  I know, nit-picking again but come on Paramount, dole out a few bucks to round some people up.  3 stars.<br />Bottom line, this film is still worth the purchase price no matter the shortcomings. After all, the film is what we watch over and over, not the extras. My hope is that with the 30th anniversary quickly approaching and DVD's being embraced by consumers much more now than in 1999, maybe we will get the background documentary and scene selection us \\"Chinatown junkies\\" may want to see.
0743244249|3.0|I should profess that I have never read a novel by Don DeLillo before diving into \\"Cosmopolis.\\" Sure, I have heard of \\"White Noise,\\" \\"Underworld,\\" and \\"Libra\\" before, but decided to start with this new, short novel about a billionaire stock tycoon and his trip through the wilds of New York City. DeLillo seems to possess many fans in the literary world, rabid readers who devour everything this guy decides to pass off on the public. I usually see him associated with people like Pynchon or Gaddis, post-modern writers who create sprawling works of endless complexity and dubious quality. Since my experiences with the post-modern genre are slight at best, all I have to go on is my experiences with this book.<br />The plot seems simple enough. Eric Packer, a twenty eight year old Wall Street whiz, decides he wants to get a haircut. Moreover, he sets out on his excursion in a giant, cork lined white limousine with his bodyguards, advisors, doctors, and drivers in tow. Along the way, Packer undergoes a physical examination of a most personal nature, runs into his new wife at various places, witnesses an anarchist protest, gets attacked with a cream pie, becomes emotional about a rapper's funeral, and discovers someone is stalking him with a view to causing serious injury. There is little that ties these events and encounters together, as even the quest for a haircut often drops into the background when Packer bogs down in New York City traffic. Surrounded by computers and an endless flow of information, the billionaire spends most of his time waxing philosophic about the state of the world, the state of his mind, and the state of his attempt to make a killing off the Japanese yen. Ultimately, that is all this novel seems to do: throw out endless noodlings about the emptiness of life in the high tech, over stimulated information age.<br />DeLillo's writing style is the best thing going for \\"Cosmopolis.\\" Infused with deep cynicism and a measurable detachment, it still crackles with crisp, short sentences that convey much with little ado. The problem comes when the language puts too much out there, when the reader starts to bog down under the endless litany of Packer's mental ramblings. Although this book is extremely short and can be finished in a day, it still seems too long at times. If there is any point to this tale, or at least where the point seems to assume clarity, it is when Packer and his \\"advisor on theory\\" discuss the meaning of the ticker boards with their endless scroll of information and the implications of self-immolating oneself to protest capitalism. Eric's accumulation of information threatens to overwhelm his existence because all he possesses is random bits of information. He cannot seem to tie it all together into any relevant meaning other than making money. There seems to be a germ of hope for him towards the end of the story, but most of the book is merely cerebral gymnastics.<br />The message of \\"Cosmopolis,\\" about a man who has everything but wilts under his own inflated ego and goes off on a rampage, is definitely familiar. Bret Easton Ellis did something similar in \\"American Psycho,\\" and he did it better. Eric Packer and Patrick Bateman are blood brothers, albeit relatives separated by about twenty years. When will these Wall Street archetypes' meltdowns have finality to them? Probably when the capitalist system finally collapses. In the meantime, we have people like Ellis and DeLillo dutifully reporting the carnage of undreamt of riches on the souls of humanity.<br />Many people out there are quite knowledgeable about DeLillo's body of work and the philosophy that powers them. I can draw no firm conclusions about this author from reading just one of his books. But I strongly suggest thinking twice before plunging into \\"Cosmopolis.\\" It takes too much effort for too little return.s with crisp, short sentences that convey much with little ado.

B00008J4P5|5.0|What more can I say about this album then its wonderful. Jack White and the loveable Meg White, brother and sister rock duo join up once again to bring you some of the most unqiue tunes of our time. Jack throws in a bit of everything, keeping a blues and jazz curve while throwing in the grunge and distortion youd expect from a White Stripes album.<br />&quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; takes the cake as song number one on the album, delivering a bass-guitarless masterpiece of vocal and instrumental harmony, containing the &quot;Riff of the century&quot;. Listen to it, and you'll understand.<br />&quot;Black Math&quot; delivers a fast paced speed chase with a highly rebelious attitude and lots of lovely vocals. Jack White delivers his high pitched theatricals throughout, with such lyrics as &quot;Mathematically turning the page / Unequivocally showing my age&quot;, this poetic song deserves its second place.<br />And the album stays on a flowing trend, sending the listener into the wave of what this CD is all about, and thats harmony of all music. Jazz, Blues, and Rock and Roll find there homes here. Jack and Meg did something right with this album, and its rightfully so that it was #1 on the UK Charts.
6304595247|4.0|Emily Bronte's poetically bleak novel WUTHERING HEIGHTS is intensely involved, encompassing a span of almost thirty-five years, and taking in the likes of three generations.  Certainly it must take at least a good five hours to do this story notable justice on the screen.  I therefore kept any anticipation of a truly cohesive telling of this tale well in check as I approached it; most assuredly expecting shortcomings and, if I must say so myself, quite successfully sought and found whatever might be the finer qualities of such a story portrayed on film.  For though a number of movie adaptations had previously been made, it was not until this divine 1992 film that the whole poignant tale got told from the very beginning to the very end.<br />Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are the ill-starred couple Cathy and Heathcliff.  Heathcliff is an orphan found in Liverpool and brought home as a young child by Cathy's father, Mr. Earnshaw, a Yorkshire farmer, to be raised within the family.  Cathy and Heathcliff develop a strong bond between them as they grow up.  After Mr. Earnshaw dies, and his estate is left in the hands of his heir, Cathy's older brother Hindley, Heathcliff is cast down from the place of a beloved adopted son to that of a servant and farmhand.  Then the ideal friendship that Cathy and Heathcliff had shared as children becomes further corrupted when Edgar Linton and his sister Isabella, son and daughter of a magistrate residing in a neighboring estate, enter the picture.  What follows is a battle of wills, marked by moments of feverish passion, jealousy, a marriage proposal, a disappearance, and a quest for revenge.  Fiennes and Binoche have their moments, and they lead a fairly well known cast - Janet McTeer as the maid Nelly, Simon Shepard as Edgar, Sophie Ward as Isabella, and Jeremy Northam as Hindley.<br />Originally, in the novel, it is the Earnshaw's servant girl, Nelly, who narrates this story.  This movie, however, takes on a somewhat venturous liberty by casting Sinead O'Connor to tell the tale, in the personage of author Emily Bronte.  Wuthering Heights is a castle of sorts, a bit more grand than imagined in the novel.  Notwithstanding though, the artistic landscape imagery in this movie is exquisite.<br />The role of Cathy is a difficult one, to be sure - and I've yet to see an actress wholly capture her tempestuous nature.  Truly Binoche is a very fine actress, as well as a rare beauty.  Her looks and mannerisms, however, are somewhat too exotically European - and her accent is markedly French.  She presents a rather mature, less impulsive Cathy, which does not at all strike one as a wild Yorkshire farm girl. In the whole of this film, there were only two scenes in which the intensity of her performance even came close to the power of the novel - that when she's telling Nelly about Edgar Linton's marriage proposal, and the scene where, in a fever after Heathcliff has run off with Isabella, she sends her soliloquy through an open window into the blustering night air.  Both these scenes take from the book some of Bronte's most beautiful language.<br />Ralph Fiennes is also a very fine actor - and he's especially adept at playing brooding characters with a lot of pent up passion brewing under the surface.  He approaches Heathcliff in this same manner.  But Heathcliff in his younger years is something of a raging wild animal, too emotionally immature to keep his fury under wraps.  Indeed, I must say Fiennes' Heathcliff misses the mark by no small distance, especially in those scenes which take place before Cathy's death.  Like Binoche, he is simply too mature - his Heathcliff is just not believable as a farm hand who's only around the age of 20.  It is actually in the scenes that take place after Cathy's death that Fiennes' performance really kicks in:  despairing madman, obsessive necromancer - he plays it up to the fullest extreme of ruthless wickedness.  In administering revenge upon those he hates he'sdownright scary.<br />I was rather disappointed that two major characters from the novel, Nelly and Hindley, were herein given so little attention.  A key scene from the book - in which Hindley, recruiting a rifle and some assistance from Isabella, tries to eliminate Heathcliff - was completely omitted in this movie.  Both Northam and McTeer put forth flawless performances for what little screen time they're given - but I believe that certain plot holes and transitional errors occurred due to the fact that these two were not fully drawn out.  The third generation - Hindley's son Hareton (Jason Riddington) is ruggedly good looking; Jonathan Firth (brother of Colin Firth) plays Heathcliff's decrepit son Linton with relish; however, the fact that Binoche took on dual roles - as both Cathy and, with a blond wig, her daughter Catherine Linton - rather made me cringe.  The scene in which Heathcliff exacts his revenge upon Catherine, who looks essentially the same as the supposed great love of his life, just didn't sit well with me at all.<br />For a more accurate portrayal of Cathy and Heathcliff in the early years before their children are born, look to a 1971 version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS starring Timothy Dalton and Anna Calder-Marshall.  As for this version, I really must say that even with its various shortcomings, it's overall a very lovely, entertaining movie.downright scary.<br />I was rather disappointed that two major characters from the novel, Nelly and Hindley, were herein given so little attention.

B00008S2VG|2.0|Although I readily admit that some of Madonna's work has taken time to grow on me, as exemplified by incredible \\"Erotica\\", which was grossly overlooked by both critics and fans mostly because it was released in junction with a provocative book and surrounded by the usual publicity blitz. However, I can say with certainty that this is Madonna's weakest effort to date and there is very little chance of this perception changing.<br />Why is this release so disappointment to me? Let me count the ways... Instead of an \\"extension\\" of the work started with \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Music\\", \\"American Life\\" feels derivative and truly without focus. Furthermore, Madonna's voice (with the exception of two cuts) has never sounded more off key and the arrangements are repetitive and lack harmony.<br />I give this release 2 stars, instead of 1, only because of \\"Die Another Day\\", which is surprisingly strong and at least shows a semblance of life. Also, the song \\"American Life\\" is not great, but it has a catchy chorus that does not sound like the didactic diatribe that is \\"American Life\\".<br />Lastly, although I generally don't bother in focusing anything but the music, could Madonna have approved such a boring and empty cover and inadequate insert? Also, the title of the album seems highly inappropriate as this is almost like a personal diary with all the right words one would use to try and impress an Enlgish high school teacher and is not a reflection of an \\"American Life\\". I know, that this is kind of irrelevant, but I really expect much more from Madonna, especially when she has it in her to do much better than this.<br />Instead of buying this release, which is so weak, grab ANY of her other CDs in your collection and you'll be much more happy than if you invest in this.

Alex is a teenage boy that just found out that his uncle is dead because of a serious car accedent. Alex doesn't believe that his uncle was killed in an accedent, so he sets out to find the truth. He finds his uncle's BMW with bullet holes in the side. This book is very discriptive when it comes to explaning the characters. The auther keeps you reading because of all of the twists and turns of events. The story is very easy to follow because of easy vocabulary and flowing sentences.
0385504209|3.0|For those who will understand this, the Da Vinci Code is a prodigious work of unparalleled imagination, machination and ultimately irony.  It is the final assault of the left-brained against the citadel of the right brain.  The irony is that Brown uses the right-brain's most valuable asset (and therefore its most vulnerable) to gain entrance to the Holy of Holies and wreak havoc.  The Da Vinci Code is the Twenty-first Century embodiment of the two-edged sword.  Or is it Excalibur revisited?
B00008S2VG|5.0|i LOVE american life.  it's fantastic and madonna proves once again that she is ahead of the game.  the music in this album is so awesome that you can't get enough (literally)!  the mix of folk, techno, &amp; yes, rap make this her best album yet.  the songs on this cd market to a broad range of music lovers.  buy it - you won't be dissapointed!
B00005JKPF|5.0|Before I even begin, I have to stress out my point that this is a review of X2 as a stand-alone movie.  We all know that this is a sequel, but to give a fair review, I have to write about this film without having to compare it to the first installment.<br />The whole plot of the film zeroes in on a military officer named Mr. William Stryker.  His disappointment in life lies in the fact that his son is a mutant.  Therefore he goes out on a mission to destroy every living mutant on the planet.  We also learn later on in the film that it is this character who was responsible for the creation of the X-Men character, Wolverine.  <br />Because of this sudden appearance of Mr. William Stryker, the X-Men and the other mutants Magneto and Mystique are forced to join forces whether they like it or not.  New X-Men characters are introduced in this film and are given more character depth- namely Iceman (a.k.a. as Bobby Drake), and Pyro.  Iceman has the ability to create all forms of ice either with a simple touch, or one breath.  Pyro has a similar power, the difference is that he can manipulate fire in all forms and use it to destroy his enemies.   His weakness is that he can only control the fire, he cannot ignite it.  Patrick Stewart, James Marsden, Halle Berry, and Famke Jemsen all come back to reprise their roles as Professor X, Cyclops, Storm, and Dr. Jean Grey.  The same goes with Ian McKellen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Magneto and Mystique.  <br />In X2, the title can't be more apt because despite their differences in opinion about how to deal with the human race accepting the mere existence of mutants, they are uncomfortably forced to unite to defeat their enemy, Mr. William Stryker.  <br />I find this film impressive because a lot of comic book characters have been turned into movies such as Superman, Spiderman, Batman, and Daredevil.  However, director Bryan Singer manages not to create a film that is not too comic booky, silly, or downright stupid.  It has a PG-13rating because kids are not going to totally absorb the lesson in this film.  Children may walk away wishing they had extra-ordinary powers and become X-Men as well, but they still won't be able to grasp the whole genesis of X2- with the exception of the (no pun intended) intellectually gifted kids.  Some of the characters of this film are given a lot of character depth; which is imperative in every film.<br />My disappointment in X2 lies in the fact that I its one hour and 55 minutes of screen time, they still fail to give character development in Cyclops, Storm, and Mystique.  We delve deeper into the psyche of Wolverine and why he has all this rage exploding inside him.  We also are entertained into how Iceman's family reacts when they learn that their son is a mutant.  I was laughing when Iceman's mother asks him, \\"Have you ever tried...not being a mutant?\\"  This can very well be a metaphor for homosexuality- mothers asking their gay children if they could convert to heterosexuality, which is an impossible feat.<br />All in all, X2 is an entertaining, sci-fi action flick that surprisingly makes you ask questions about yourself- was there a time that I was considered a misfit but I still felt better about it?  Was there a time that I feared someone because he or she had something out of the ordinary?
0780021150|4.0|First, let me say I'd like to split my review:<BR>I give the film 5 stars, no question, but the dvd transfer only 3 stars.<BR>First, the transfer:<BR>This transfer is great given most of the available alternatives, at least in R1 North America.  Its relatively clean, and the audio is adequate although there's some hiss and crackles and there's one spot where its missing sound for a few seconds.<BR>There is one problem, though, and that is the fact that the aspect ratio (screen size) is not correct.  M was shot with an aspect ratio of 1.17:1, not 1.33:1 as Criterion states.  This was the standard aspect ratio of early German 'talkies' and Blue Angel, for example, was shot in this same 1.17:1 aspect ratio.  Criterion has used the same film element that they used for their LD edition of M, one that originated from a private collection in Switzerland.  As a result, their film is just slightly clipped compared to the original.<BR>There is in fact a more recent restoration that is uniformly better in both video, audio and technical details (a different film element that went through a complete digital restoration a few years ago) but this is only available in a German only R2 disk (available from Amazon's German and British websites).<BR>Anyway, my comments about the dvd technical details aside, M is one of the all time classics of cinema.  If you've seen any thriller made after this film, then you've seen elements of M.  The story involves the search for a serial murderer of children, played by Peter Lorre.  The police start cracking down on crime all over Berlin, causing the underworld to become concerned about business.  The crooks hold a meeting, and decide to find the killer themselves, using street people and beggars to help hunt him down: the result is a competition, almost, between crooks and police to catch the murderer.  Who is more effective and why?<BR>There are a many scenes that are incredibly memorable, and have been copied repeatedly since this film.  Trust me, when you see M you'll recognize how well the film has stood the test of time, and how often imitated its been.  Perhaps one of my favorite scenes involves simultaneous meetings (in separate locations) between the police officials on one hand and the mob on the other.  The film switches back and forth between the two in a seamless fashion, showing how both more or less have the same problem but completely different motivations.<BR>M is early filmmaking at its best....  you should see this film just to appreciate how often its been imitated in the years since.
038572179X|2.0|The plot is simple:  through a series of events, 13 year Briony jumps to the erroneous conclusion that her sister's soon-to-be-boyfriend is the rapist of their  young cousin.  Even when she begins to doubt what she saw, she doesn't back down from her story and the young man spends several years in prison before he wins an appeal.  <br />The plot is simple but McEwan's style of writing throws so much verbiage at the reader that you are bombarded with far more information than you need. You find yourself silently screaming \\"Get to the story!\\"  Instead of empathizing with any of the characters, the reader ends up feeling like he (or she) is on the outside looking in at the lives of people that you really don't care about at all.  <br />This is one of those rare books that will probably be far more enjoyable as a made-for- television movie.
0060090383|5.0|I firmly believe that Marian Keyes is one of the most talented, creative, and hilarious authors today.  I love her work.  She is one of my absolute favorite authors and I tend to read ANYTHING she writes.  &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; is Ms. Keyes' first book and I read it in a day and a half.  It's a wonderful tale of addiction and redemption.  Rachel's decent into alcoholism is tragic and disturbing - but also very real and honest.  I truly respect Ms. Keyes and her talent.  This book reflects the difficulties she had in her own life and I give her full credit for tackling this demon in her work.<br />Truly well done and very enjoyable.  A triumph and a great read!<br />Discover Marian Keyes --- you'll be glad you did.
B0000028RR|5.0|I'm a biased Rage fan so of course I'll give this max stars.  Tom Morello comes up with the best dang hooks - the kind that stick in your head all day.  If you want his more experimental guitar work, pick up the later albums.  I look like an idiot when I drive with this playing.  I feel like bashing in my steering wheel.  I listen to my parents music, and that stuff is way soft.  It's hard to imagine my kids listening to ANYTHING with more force than Killing in the Name.  Instead of the usual \\"I hate myself\\" or \\"i'm having an identity crisis\\" melancholy, this is a rock album that raises awareness about social/political issues that affect every day people.  Honestly though, anyone who knows what real hip hop is knows that there are MCs thousands times better than Zack.  No one grunts like him though.
B00008NRI8|2.0|I've always been a big fan of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock and I was really looking forward to seeing the two of them together. I sincerely wanted to enjoy myself, but the one thing you heard ALL the critics agree upon about this film turned out to be absolutely true-- It's about as ordinary and unoriginal as a romantic comedy can be. The conflicting question among all the critics was this: Were Bullock and Grant able to turn a rather dull movie into something good? I didn't think so unfortunately. Heck, I don't even think the pairing of Superman and Wonder Woman could have saved this film. It certainly doesn't compare well to Grants previous picture, ABOUT A BOY.     My recommendation is not to waste your money on this movie unless you're a fan of these two actors... My final review is two and a half stars... Just too average and not many laughs.
B000002GQG|5.0|The Moody Blues has to be one of the most controversial rock/pop bands to emerge from the 1960's. The band has been enormously popular, had several hit songs, and sold lots of albums. But despite the public popularity, these guys were savaged by many critics. A critic in the \\"Rolling Stone Album Guide\\" comments \\"no major band has so relentlessly parlayed nonsense...were it not for their titanic success, in fact, they might easily be dismissed as an odd and overlong joke.\\" The article goes on to describe the Moodies as bombastic, pretentious and pompous, with their biggest hits \\"tricked out with furiously strummed acoustic guitars [like those] from the Who\\".<br />That's pretty harsh stuff. If they're so bad, why have they been so popular? To be fair, their lyrics are often a little corny, especially now. Further, they probably weren't as musically creative as the Beatles, the Who, or some others. Nevertheless, the were among the first to experiment with the idea of the concept album, among the first to make effective use of sythesizers, and among the first to employ symphonic sounds in a rock format. Most especially, though, many simply found the Moodies' music nice to listen to. Their songs were based on pleasant melodies and featured nice harmonies. Critics may look for depth and originality, but the average consumer just wants a good sound. The Moody Blues, at their best, delivered that big time.<br />IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD was the band's second attempt at a concept album (DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED was the first, but was somewhat different because of the attempt to connect the songs with orchestral interludes). It was based around a consideration of \\"levels of consciousness\\" and eastern philosophical ideas that had been popularized at the time (circa 1967-8) by the Beatles. Lyrically, it may come across now as a little silly (if you don't recall the times or find such speculation of interest), but the music still sounds good. Much of the album has a bright, airy quality. Acoustic guitars and flutes dominate many of the cuts. The melodies are soft, but the tunes remain lively. I never hear this album without finding something from it playing in my mind hours later.<br />I originally bought this album soon after it was released. Now, I have it on CD as well. It's a purchase I have never regretted, and I still listen to it. It may not be brilliant and it may be a bit dated, but the sound is good. Compared to most of the contemporary rock music I've heard, it's great. Take a \\"trip around the bay\\" with these guys. You'll probably be glad you did.quality.

B00008S2VG|5.0|The latest round of Maddy bashing is quite annoying given the stellar album she's just released.  &quot;Life&quot; is a complete concept album with the best musical variety from M. in quite some time.  The title track just may be the weakest track on this album - but it certainly deserved a better reception than it got.  BTW, the rap is meant to be satirical, so listen to it with that in mind.<br />Stand out tracks on here are the beautifully layered &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; and &quot;Love Profusion&quot;.  She displays good vocals with some interesting song structures (M. sounds great in her lower registers) and comes up with some interesting harmonies as well (check out X-static Process).  &quot;Hollywood&quot; is a great summer track and &quot;Intervention&quot; is a moving ode to the guys in her life (Rocco and Mr. Ritchie).<br />Don't let the media fool you - the reviews for this album have been generally positive with some mixed and some bad.  In any case, don't let misconceptions interfere with you experiencing some good tunes from an accomplished artist.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth/Damnation wow, great job guys. Material well written, produced, arranged. It's enough to make Pink Floyd Blue Floyd. I must give some credit to Steve Wilson who co/produced and engineered this great release. Steve also plays mellotron, grand piano, guitar and backing vocals on this release. For those of who don't know who Steve Wilson is? He is the mastermind behind the band Porcupine Tree. I'm not a big fan of the earlier releases of Opeth, since I'm not a fan of the cookie monster style vocals. Not that the previous releases are not good. They are all great in their own way. Damnation is a perfect work of art. It is the best CD that I have purchase this year. I would give this release a ten star rating, but they will not allow me to. Please purchase at once and support real art.
B00008S2VG|4.0|When first purchasing this album i was a bit skeptical, not being a huge madonna fan i didnt know what to expect. &quot;Music&quot; was a album that got very little play in my cd player but only because of two tracks 'what it feels like for a girl' and 'gone' but with American Life that is completely different, from the echanting sound of 'love profusion' to the totally unexpected choir in 'nothing fails' this album is awesome and nearly flawless. the only problem i have with this album is the fact that it took some time to grow on me and some of the guitar based tracks all sound a little similar.<BR>     the stand out songs i believe are 'american life'-with its highly politcal view, 'nobody knows me' with its techno/dance beat, im actually anticapating this song to turn into a single just for the remixes, the semi-love song 'x-static process'-i especially love the part where two voices of madonna are singing at once each at a different pitch, and the sad but techno 'mother and father'. all and all this album is good, it even made me want to go out and buy 'ray of light' and a review of that album would take far to long because its so good.
0783231032|4.0|Movie: Ok, I must addmit, this is the famous Speilburg flop, but hey it's Steven Speilburg! It can't be all bad! That's what I though when I rented it, and guess what, I loved it. It doesn't compare to his other masterpeices, but is a great classic. Although the jokes don't always work, there so many of them it doesn't matter. The plot, along with it's allstar cast is really extremely enjoyable. It's a week after the attacks of Pearl Harbor, histeria has hit the west coast, for fear of another attack. Things get so out of control, that most of the caos come from misunderstandings, our own planes and war nerves create total panic and ruin in some parts of L.A. It was decent with out the extra half-hour of footage, it great with it! Just sit back and enjoy one of speilburg's strangest films. <BR>Movie: 4 stars out of 5 stars<BR>DVD: This DVD is a great addition to the dirctor's cut. There's are dosens of stills, cut sceans, and an excellent one hour and fourty minuet documentary. Unfourchantly, the picture and sound quality aren't great but, usually is not noticable, the movie totaly distracts you from it. A DVD worth the movie.<BR>DVD: 3 out of 5 (It's 3 due to the poor picture and sound quality)
B00005JLR2|5.0|This is yet another example of a really great movie that got totally shafted at the box office. It was only in my local theatre for a short time (because of all the other big hyped up movies coming out at that time), but I saw it twice and it is, in my opinion, one of the best things Disney has come out with in the past 5-10 years. Lilo and Stitch was entertaining, I'll give it that, but Treasure Planet was far better. Apparently a disfunctional child and a space koala just don't have the brilliant witty repartee of a cat woman in a space age captain's uniform.
0684833395|5.0|The novel Catch-22 deals with the soldiers stationed on a small island just off the coast of Italy during World War II.  The main plot is focused around the story of Yossarian, one of the many soldiers on the island.  Yossarian is different from many of the men stationed there as he takes the war personally and gets annoyed that he has to be there, facing danger everyday.  He continually tries to find ways to get out of the war and go home, but every plan he comes up with always has a catch, catch-22.  This catch ruins all his plans and makes them seem illogical.  Throughout the novel Yossarian has to fight against everyone to gain back his life and get what he wants.  <BR>I enjoyed this novel because of the serious yet satirical tone that is used to convey the major theme. Heller used humor to make the book less controversial and to entertain the reader, while trying to make a statement.  He also dealt with a very serious subject matter, the topic of war, which everyone has differing views on.  He discusses the fighting and death that occurs in any war and is very graphic in his descriptions of what happens, but through being straightforward and blunt, Heller makes a stronger statement about war and its brutality.  The descriptions affected me and my heart went out to all the soldiers involved in the war. Then, when Heller brought the humor back in I began to laugh out loud at the experiences he discussed.  I truly enjoyed the way Heller wrote the novel and found that the mix of humor with the serious topic of war worked well to convey his message and made the novel truly original.<BR>The novel does not only discuss war and cannot just be considered an anti-war novel.  The novel can relate to any aspect of human life and make sense in almost any situation, making it a universal novel.  The issues that Catch-22 deals with are issues and emotions every person has confronted at one time or another, such as anger, loss, pain, determination and selfishness.  All the characters have to overcome these emotions if they want to survive the war and make it in the world.  <BR>I found Catch-22 to be an excellent novel about gaining your own freedom and becoming your own person and enjoyed the fact that it used such a controversial and universal topic as war to convey that message.  <BR>A great read for anyone.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|I love Beauty & the Beast!  It is one of my favorites, but in the re-released edition, the animation looks HORRIBLE.  I still have my video from when it came out the first time and the animation on it looks great, but I was incredibly disappointed with the DVD.  I thought it would look better and clearer than the video, but I was wrong.  It looks like a cheap cartoon instead of the masterpiece it was.
B000002AHM|5.0|This music is truely amazing.  You wonder how fingers can move that fast and how they do it with amazing percision.  Independently, these three guys can stand on their own and when you listen to them together it truely is a work of art.  Their performance is technically superior and a wonderful study of the masters playing music together LIVE.  Give it a listen, you won't be disappointed and it will leave you wondering....
B000084T18|5.0|I think this cd is an awesome cd he has the best lyrics and everything he talks about in his songs is about the real life. I think he is  brillant artist and he desreves alot of credit so i give him much props he is awesome. This cd is awesome i bought it and also bought it for a friend i cant wait to see him in concert. Well bye for now 50 cent keep doing what ur doin ur an awesome and talented rapper.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I found &quot;Serenity&quot;, the last track on this CD, to be a song that I could listen to over and over. Each time I hear something new or feel that familiar tingle of pleasure from listening to truly great music. &quot;Faceless&quot;, Godsmack's newest release is a rockin' and groovin' CD. It has the hard hitting tracks that we all love like &quot;I Stand Alone' and then it has the melodic &quot;Serenity&quot; to wrap us in musical velvet.<br />This is a true work of art and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a true rock experience.
B00008J4P5|4.0|This is an outstanding album, if you like White Blood Cells, by all means get it immediately.  Some posters here seem to be either reflexive haters of anything with hype attached to it, or victims of that nasty streak of popularity-hating so treasured by some inane &quot;indie&quot; types.  Ignore them and buy the album. I enjoy everything from Coltrane to Killing Joke.  Good songs are good songs and that is what you get here.
078062565X|5.0|Just about everything that one can say about this terrific film has already been said. One thing that keeps appearing, either in the customer reviews or in the many articles written about &quot;King Kong&quot; is the comment that Skull Island is in the Pacific Ocean.<BR>The island is southwest of Indonesia (then called the Dutch East Indies) which places it in the Indian Ocean.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Who's Next, the last truly great Who album from start to finish, has been expanded to double-album status with the addition of outtakes from the original aborted Lifehouse sessions with Kit Lambert and an entire disc of live tracks from the Young Vic shows. The live material is nearly as impressive as the \\"Live at Leeds\\" shows and Pete sounds more than a little irked with the audience as his smart-aleck dialogue between numbers would suggest. As most Who fans already know, Who's Next was culled from the ashes of Pete Townshend's abandoned Lifehouse multi-media concept. Every last scrap of what remains from that project is here and may be a little overwhelming for the average Who fan. The sound quality is great but not appreciably better than the previous reissue. \\"Baba O'Riley\\", \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" were the biggest hits, but some of the leftover Lifehouse tracks are solid as well, including \\"Pure and Easy\\" and \\"Naked Eye\\". A great investment for the Who freak but nonessential to the casual fan.
6305508550|3.0|I thought Office Space was fantastic...a great comedy dealing with the troubles of confined cubicle work and nightmarish bosses. The DVD left something to be desired though. Very skimpish on the special features. I was also a little frustrated by Fox's lame attempt at promoting the DVD by placing three pictures of Jennifer Aniston on the back of the case, when she barely appears in the film at all, and none of the promo pics even show any of the actual plotline of the film, concerning the three \\"heroes\\" Peter Gibbons, Michael Bolton, and Samir Naga-something(no one can ever pronounce his last name). I also loved the performance by Gary Cole as Lumberg. I have found myself spouting off \\"What's Happening?\\" to my friends since I first saw the film in '99. Film score: 8 out of 10. DVD score: 3 out of 10
0688163173|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Lehane's descriptions are hard edged and biting.  He doesnt let you go for a second. The last chapters were a surprise but DUH! what did I read it for!<br />You wont sleep soundly for a night or two just thinking this one over, but its worth every second.  Good on ya, Dennis
0446677450|3.0|This is the first review I've written on Amazon.  The reason I feel compelled to write is that about half-way through this book, the author discusses buying a home out of foreclosure, quickly reselling it for triple the price and then quickly making $190,000 in the Phoenix real estate market in the \\"early 90's.\\"  Two points: 1) the transaction described is nothing more than a get-rich-quick type opportunity (not available on daily basis to the average Joe) whereas the author, throughout the book, admonishes that his book is not of the get-rich-quick nature; and 2) more disturbing is that this book was written in 97/98 time frame; the reference period for this transaction is the \\"early 90's\\" and the author HAS TO BORROW $2,000 for leverage for this deal.  Why would a multi-millionaire need to borrow $2,000?  While the overall message of the book is good, that just cripled the author's credibility is my opinion.<br />I will quickly summarize the book's message: buy real estate and/or other income producing items in order to generate cash flow in addition to that of your salary.
0060512806|3.0|As many other reviewers have noted, this book is very long. Unfortunately it is long because of the author's self indulgent tangents, not because of character and plot development (like Shogun).<br />When the author kept to the topic, the book was interesting and well written. At half the length it would have been a much better book.
B00006M183|4.0|Ive been a PJ fan for years and i must say, this album is nothing like their previous work.  Over the years PJ has amde the transition from the loud grunge band that it started as to more deep and circumspect lyrics.  Although this album lacks impact songs like \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Betterman\\", it still has potential to turn some heads with songs like \\"All or None\\" (more stereotypical PJ) and \\"Thumbing My Way\\", which sounds more like...well it doesnt sound like PJ thats for sure.either way this is still a great album which is definatly worth purchasing.
B00006IU73|4.0|It's an immutable fact of life that nothing is ever as good as the hype. Porcupine Tree has been hyped as the next big progressive rock band, and In Absentia is often touted as the best album of 2002. Suffice it to say that I bought this album with high expectations, and while I wasn't disappointed, I think it's fair to say that this is a good album - but not a great one.<br />First of all, I take issue with the label that this is progressive rock music. Porcupine Tree is more of a hybrid of progressive and alternative rock - think Spock's Beard meets Radiohead. The result is music full of beautiful vocal harmonies and subtle but luscious keyboards (love those Mellotrons) packaged in songs that adhere to standard time signatures and lengths. It's a winning combination, made all the better by Steve Wilson's impressive talent for writing lyrics and melodies that evoke genuine feeling. I challenge anyone to listen to &quot;Heart Attack In A Lay-By&quot; and not be moved. <br />Still, as a listener who enjoys ambitious music, I found myself longing for more. Wilson and company are competent musicians, but Roine Stolt or Rick Wakeman they are not. A little more experimentation and a little less clinging to alt rock cliches would have made this album stronger for me. <br />In Absentia will please or displease you depending on your expectations. Come expecting true progressive rock and you'll be disappointed. For those willing to try a scaled down progressive sound, however, the beautiful and honest songs on this disc will be a wonderful surprise.
B00005JGAF|5.0|Great Googly Moogly! These were the words that came out of my mouth after I heard this album. Rocket To Russia should be one of the greatest rock records ever. From \\"Cretin Hop\\" to their cover of \\"Surfin Bird\\" to \\"Teenage Lobotomy\\" to \\"I Wanna Be Well\\" to \\"Rockaway Beach\\" to every damn song on this album! I love everything about this record. From start to finish it has everything that makes the Ramones great, and then some. If you want some good old fashioned rock n roll, don't go get a Stink-182 or Scum-41 album.  Get this and listen to it until you realize how extremely wonderful it really is.
B00007L4MJ|3.0|While I very much appreciate the overall quality of the restoration, I am appalled by the decision to translate the intertitles into English. What a missed opportunity; what disrespect for the historicity of the work. I venture to say that many of my colleagues in academia will continue to put up with the bad sound and the poor video quality of their old VHS edition.
B00005JGAB|5.0|Punk exists because of the false assumption that the Ramones can be imitated.The Ramones changed music for me and for any rock fan after 1976.  On their debut album they prove that it takes sophistication to understand the simplicity of their music.  You don't have to be Joe Satriani to play the Ramones music, but you would miss the point if you thought of the Ramones as just another punk band. To me they are a force so pure and simple. Johnny plays his guitar so incredibly fast, no one before him played with that style. Joey is so sheepishly shy behind his rose colored glasses and with his smooth Roy Orbison/Mick Jaggar sounding voice you have to love him. Dee Dee with his 1234's and rythmic bass playing, he was truely a genious as a writer and as a musician.  Tommy had so much power and flow in his drumming style, which also nobody has played before him, make a perfect touch to make a beat. They were four great unique guys, who made great and unique music that changed the world, and this album is only the start.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is possibly the best war related movie out with the exceptions of: Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. Those two movies are in a league by themselves. For this movie, I would rate this number 1 in the second tier of great recently made military movies. (I havent watched many of the old ones so I cant and wont judge them in this category) <br /> <br />The main thing I like about this movie, is how it shows how war affects the military family. (The soldier, their spouse, and children) Nearly all military movies ignore that aspect. I grew up as a military bratt and served in the Air Force so I understand what military families go through. This movie shows that aspect wonderfully. <br /> <br />As for the war part, the battle scenes are done very well... very realistic. One thing I liked about the war part of this movie is that the movie not only focused on telling the story from the USA's point of view but also our enemies.  <br /> <br />Basically, if this is one of those movies you have seen on the shelf and cant decide to watch or not, stop thinking about it and watch it. You wont be sorry. IF you have watched it before, well its great you came back for more.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|What can I say! Godsmacks done it again. This album brings you back to the realm of rock in typical har Godsmack fashion. Sully's vocals knock you off your feet while the rest of the band continues to keep you rocking with a beat that seizes you by the throat and doesnt let you drop till a hour after its done. In a time of mainly pop sounding releases Godsmack has brought a breath of fresh air to the stale sounds of current releases.
B00008VGL6|5.0|I thought this album was excalent. I was thrilled to see Martin L. Gore has come out with a second solo album sense Counterfeit e.p. released in 1989. This album had the unmistakable sound of Depeche Mode but in definetly all Martin L. Gore. I would recomend this album to any true Depeche Mode fan or anyone who likes their music a little left of normal.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is by far the best album I have heard in years, and being over 40 this goes back quite aways. Not being a big fan of the so-called nu-metal bands, which all seem to follow the &quot;let's see how loud and angry we can sound formula&quot; I was very surprised by this band. I was curious about them after hearing the single, &quot;Bring me to Life&quot;. I think the comparison to Linkin' Park is way off. Just cause they put a male metal/rapper in the song everyone says, &quot;Hey Linkin' Park Jr.&quot;. I think there sound is much more diverse and full. With the combination of strings, piano, synths, and heavy guitar you would think this would be one big sonic mess, but they pull it off quite well. Make no mistake, all of the various instrumentation and arrangements, are there for one purpose, and that is to support Amy Lee's amazing vocals. Even in their heaviest moments they make sure her voice is front and center and not obscured by anything. I just have to say, where did this girl come from? She is by far one of the best female vocalists to come along in years. She has the dynamic range of Pat Benetar with the melodic voicing of Ann Wilson, and she manages to eclipse both of them. I think the real test of her vocal power are on the 2 ballads, &quot;My Immortal&quot;, and &quot;Hello&quot;. I think these songs show that Amy could sing the phone book and make it compelling. I have listened to this album at least 30 times in the last 5 days, and I have not tired of it yet. I can't wait to see what they do next.
B00008VGL6|5.0|I thought this album was excalent. I was very pleased with this follow up of his first solo album Counterfeit e.p. released in 1989. It sticks with the Depech Mode sound but it is also definetly all Martin L. Gore. I would recomed this album to any true Depeche Mode fan or any one who likes music a little left of normal.
6305364613|5.0|I'd like to start by saying what a great movie this is, right from the explosive first scene up to the last, it's just amazing. Baz Luhrmann is the best director that ever lived and this is easily the best and most original adaptation of a play that there ever was. This is a must buy.
B00006RIO7|5.0|So very exciting, it will make you want to sing and dance!
B000002LND|5.0|This is simply the best greatest hits collection from the 80's.  This album has all of Madonna's big hits, even though there are some hits that are missing such as Burning Up, Everybody, Dress You Up, Who's That Girl, Causing A Comotion, True Blue, Oh Father, and Keep It Together.  There was simply not enough room for all of her hits, but she will probably release these hits in some other form, maybe for her 20th aniversery.  This set is great if you like Madonna's 80's hits.  This collection is truly Immaculate.
B00003CXXS|2.0|&quot;Jurassic Park 3&quot; is probably the most disappointed with a film I've ever been. It had so much going for it, and delivered so little. The film's biggest problem is the silly plot. The first film was believable, the second film was fun, this one's got energy, but we've been there, done that. But back to the plot: Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is lured back to the island the same way he was lured the first time: with money. That Grant could possibly be so greedy and stupid is the film's most unbelievable part. Most everyone (the characters) in this movie deserves to be eaten by dinosaurs, but only a few are. In a way, I'm glad Spielberg didn't direct this one. This would have seriously hurt his career. It's not a terrible film, but it's not good. I'd say only hardcore fans might like this one. But that's only a guess.
B00005JLH3|4.0|More dramtic then comedy. I good movie without the run of the mill, typical storyline. Good acting by all. The ending is a little bit of a cop out though. Good to see an African-American cast. You dont see a lot of those in Hollywood movies.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|The novel \\"The Time Machine\\" is a classic. It's a dark, horrifying story about man's future. This is a bright, hopeful movie that seems a little pointless and too short to really give us much of a story. It wastes time playing with the machine itself and less time in the future. Running just barely an hour and a half, this provides a few cheap thrills, but nothing more. Guy Pearce plays the time traveler who loses his wife and wants to go back in time to save her. The book didn't waste its time with this subplot, and instead went straight to the future. This movie should've done that, but it wants a love story, so who cares. Finally he goes to the future and sees that man has separated into two species, the Eloi and the Morlocks. Morlocks live underground and feast on the Eloi. Eloi are peaceful people who are innocent and unaware of the Morlocks. Guy Pearce wants to fight the Morlocks, who have stolen the time machine. We get what's supposed to be a villain, but really he's just doing what evolution has brought him to do. But I'm putting too much thought into a film that doesn't want to think at all. A shame. This was a great opportunity to make an intelligent, creepy thriller. Instead we get happy and naive. I guess you can't win 'em all!
B00008VGL6|4.0|Being a Depeche Mode fan for about 20 years now, I own (and -in most cases- adore) every piece of music the guys ever made. Thus I own the first Martin Gore solo album, \\"Counterfeit\\", and had to have this new output immediately.   And how is it then?     Like the first \\"Counterfeit\\", it consists of cover versions only. Some very strong tunes (I did not know any of them before) with deep, meaningful, and sometimes strange lyrics, sophisticated arrangements - and Martin's lovable warm voice, that fits to the songs absolutely perfect.   In my eyes the latest Depeche Mode work, \\"Exciter\\", falls behind the terrific \\"Black Celebration\\", \\"Music for the Masses\\", or \\"Violator\\" periods. It's a skillful album, no doubt about that, but it will never touch me as deeply as the the mentioned albums did/do. And in a similar way the latest \\"Counterfeit²\\" cannot keep up with Martin's first solo project.   In fact, I was expecting this. The times have changed, I have changed, and so did the guys from Basildon near London and their music.     Well, to prevent a misunderstanding: The CD is good, even better than I was hoping it to be.  I cannot rate it 5 stars because it didn't produce the instant \\"Wow!!!\\"-effect like a Depeche Mode \\"Violator\\" and also his first solo CD did. But I can honestly assign 4 stars to a very complex and ambitious piece of music...
B00004U8JV|3.0|&quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; is not a perfect movie. There are parts in this movie that, yes, are pretty dumb. But there's still the science of the first. Still the sense of awe. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm, who goes back to Jurassic Park in order to save his girlfriend biologist from what he thinks is impending doom. When he and his team get there, they discover the woman is just fine, but the dinosaurs are in trouble. Hunters are capturing the dinos and transporting them to San Diego. The team realizes they have to stop them and get off the island at all cost. Pretty exciting, right? Well, it is; until they get to San Diego, where the T-Rex is set loose and the movie takes a turn for the worst. Up until the end, this film was just as exciting as its predecessor, though a little on the simple side. It wasn't as technological as the first, but it was just as thrilling. Spielberg obviously wanted to make a bigger, if not better, film and for the most part he does. The charm and wit of the first is still well in tact, and the dinosaurs are still very cool. &quot;The Lost World&quot; is a very fun movie that should hold your interest and even entertain you in more than a few parts.
B00005RYL2|5.0|One of the most original ideas that came out of he 80's and spawned a true cult following.  Highlander was the movie that made America recognize Christopher Lambert.  The story was well played out and the action was intense.  Hoever it was the idea of the immortals and their eternal struggle for the game that seperated this from the rest.<br />Highlander starts off at a sporting event.  While there Connor McCloud (Lambert) encounters an immortal.  After they duel Connor is vicotoriouse by severing the head of his opponent.  After wards the police try to track him down for the beheading.  In the mean time an old opponent from the past returns to try and slay him.  In the meantime a female detective gets ever closer to solving the mystery behind the orginal duel.  We are also shown flashbacks of when Connor was younger in the highlands of scotland where he was tutored by Rameriez (played by Sean COnnery) a spainard who was also immortal.  In the end we learn about some of the rules to include that no immortals could duel on Holy Ground.  In the end Connor is victoriouse and it is assumed that he has won the prize, mortality.<br />Highlander started a lot of things, but overall it is one of the few strong cult followings.  While it may never rival the intesity of Star Trek or Star Wars it is still a succesful series that spawned 3 sequels, 2 live action series, an animated sereis, and a possible broadway musical.  This is overall one of the best ideas and series to come out of the 80's.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite films. Let me just lay that out. This one rules. Hopefully, you've seen it by now and if you haven't you must. This techno-savvy thriller from Steven Speilberg doesn't follow its source novel to the letter, but it's just as fun to watch this movie as it is to read the (very good) book. It's about a theme park gone horribly wrong. The test tourists exploring the dinosaur park soon become dino fodder for the main attractions. This is an immensely fun movie, and is just as deserving to be called a classic as Speilberg's &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;E.T.&quot; The special effects are still incredible. That scene with the brontosaurus still sends chills down my back. It looks so real! There are plenty of mistakes in this movie, but they're mostly continuity stuff or little things. All the important stuff they got right. Speilberg is a master behind the camera, and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; proves why. This is a must-see.
B000083E79|5.0|Do you love Cher?  This is the dvd for you.  She span decades, even though she looks better than most 20 year olds.  She is amazing and this dvd does her justice.  Every song is a true and wonderful part of Cher.  You must have this dvd.
B000069CWE|1.0|this cd disappoints me greatly. hybrid theory was so great, meteora is great, and this is just un groovy. remixing your old songs is just dumb. excalmation point. no comment. well maybe one comment. soft burrito. I'll start out with the basics. this cd is stupid. no props to linkin park on this one. if linkin park gets any worse than this, i will throw a gun at my head continuously for the rest of my life. thank you.
B00008OLIO|5.0|this album finds the Crue at their very earlist, more remisecent of punk/metal than the glossed commercial rock they were to become.  Too fast for Love and Live wire are the stand outs on this well crefted album.  Mick Mars is in top form, with excellent guitar playing and riffing.  Vince Neil sounds some what different, like a singer not yet comfortable in his shoes, but this doesn't dittract from the performance.  The album even has the video for Too Fast for Love.  Is it worth it?  If you like the Crue, but are looking for where they came from.
B00005JLD4|2.0|I have to say first of all that I enjoyed watching the film--as a fictionalized historical documentary, it works well.  The scenery is amazing, the music (sounds, more like it) by Peter Gabriel is very nice, the camera work is good, and the acting decent, but there's really no story here at all.  No characters change or learn anything, nobody learns any of the life lessons that drive fiction and drama.  Things here just happen, one thing after another, like a plain narrative, and it leaves an empty feeling after the film is over.<br />The actors didn't have much to work with, it seems, and their performances show it--I agree with the reviewer who says that they seem to be caricatures.  Almost all of the white people are prejudiced, unfeeling bigots, and all of the aborigines are subservient, passive people who depend on the handouts from the whites.  I don't know if that's historically accurate, but it is somewhat painful to watch.<br />As a historical lesson about the depths to which people in power can sink when they're convinced of their own genetic &quot;superiority,&quot; I would highly recommend this film.  As a movie, a story that compels the viewer and helps us to learn more about life, I wouldn't recommend it at all--there's simply no story here.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have read with interest, the comparisons between John Mayer and Dave Matthews.  When I first heard Mayer on the radio sing \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland,\\" I was immediately transported back to the 70's and a singer named Kenny Rankin. Mayer certainly has so many vocal similarities and phrasing to Rankin's, and at times to Brit singer, Chris Rea (Listen to Rea's \\"On The Beach\\" and you'll understand what I mean). In any event, Mayer is without question a talent to be reckoned with. His lyrics are strong, his guitar playing shows his excellent music school training and will improve over time. Rarely, I have I ever bought a CD by a new artist that has such great songs. Mayer draws from many musical styles. Indeed, there are elements of jazz, rock, zydeco, and pop in his work.<br />There are 14 tracks on this CD, from the popular \\"No Such Thing,\\" \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland,\\" \\"83\\" and \\"My Stupid Mouth,\\" to the brilliant \\"the Great Indoors\\". His appeal easily cuts across age, as his lyrics deal with emotions and issues that are universal, and how we develop and deal with some of the challenges of life. There is a lot of sophistication in this 23 year old, as evidenced by his lyrics:<br /> \\"Check your pulse it's proof<br />that you're not listening to<br />The call your life's been issuing you<br />The rhythm of a line of idle days<br />Scared of a world outside<br />you should go explore<br />Pull all the shades<br />and wander the great indoors<br />The great indoors.<br />Though lately I can't blame you<br />I have seen the world<br />And sometimes wish your room had room for two<br />So go unlock the door<br />And find what you are here for<br />Leave the great indoors<br />Please leave the great indoors.\\"<br /> I can only imagine what the future will bring for this gifted young man. It will also be interesting to see whom he will collaborate with down the road. Perhaps Kenny Rankin himself, dare I hope?
B00005YW4H|5.0|Cut her a break--she's only 22.  And yet she's soulful, gentle, and incandescent in this quietly beautiful album.  Ignore all the hype over &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;; the best songs on this album are the title track &quot;Come Away with Me,&quot; &quot;Lone Star,&quot; and &quot;I've Got to See You Again,&quot; which demonstrate assured style and understated taste.  She has a way of making these (mostly) new songs sound like old, old classics that have been around forever--and surprisingly, gratefully, she's actually gotten the attention she well deserves.  Here's hoping she has a long and beautiful career.
B0000894RZ|4.0|In 1989, Lisa Stansfield crashed into the British scene with her debut single &quot;All Around the World.&quot;  With a voice that oozes soul so effortlessly, her single was an instant smash in the UK.  Some naysayers complained that &quot;All Around the World&quot; liberally borrowed the mid-tempo groove from Soul II Soul's &quot;Keep On Movin',&quot; but the voice was unmistakably Stanfield's.  That single was released the following year in the United States, and Lisa became a new international voice for blue-eyed soul.  It seemed, for a moment, that she would have a bright future ahead of her in the US, but while she continued to score a decent amount of hits overseas, each album she released on these shores sold less than the one before it. But &quot;Biography,&quot; her well-deserved singles collection, lets us Americans know what we've been missing since her debut album &quot;Affection.&quot;  In addition to her signature hit &quot;All Around the World,&quot; there are other noteworthy cuts like her respectable cover of Barry White's &quot;Never Never Gonna Give You Up,&quot; the disco-flavored &quot;This Is the Right Time,&quot; the low-key &quot;Change,&quot; and my personal favorite, the killer ballad &quot;All Woman.&quot; What sets Stansfield apart is that she takes a more classic approach to her material and avoids blatant trends.  That makes her one of the most-respected and underrated singers to be exported from across the Atlantic.  The 17 tracks on this collection certainly make this &quot;Biography&quot; complete.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Okay, to all of you \\"concerned parents\\" who think that Harry Potter ... this movie is just as good as the first... you can't expect everything from the movie... it was well done for all it had to convey.  yes, the books are better, but when is the book ever worse than the movie? <br />altogether i liked this film a lot...
B00006IU73|5.0|The first album I ever bought was Yes Fragile; I was 10 years old. I became a huge Yes fan. Since then, I have been hooked on truly good musicianship -- Genesis, King Crimson, ELP, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, and others. Of course, that was back in the '70s and early '80s. It's been a long, long time since I've been so intrigued with a band as I have been with PT. (That's not to say there hasn't been any good music since then, of course there has). Anyway, I had the good fortune to see PT during the recent Yes tour, and was simply blown away, and immediately bought In Absentia. Easily one of the very best albums I have bought in the last 10 years. In fact, beyond some of the early grunge albums, Radiohead's OK Computer and Jeff Buckley's Grace I'm having a hard time thinking of an album that has affected me as much. Unless you consider PT's other albums; after hearing In Absentia I was compelled to get as many PT albums as possible: Stars Die, Signify, Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun (limited German edition), Coma Divine (Extended edition), Metanoia... holy ..., what the \\"heck\\" have I been missing? PT crosses boundaries, appealing to die-hard progressive fans, prog-metal fans, death metal fans, plain-ol'-metal, jazz fans, grunge fans, fans of good music. In Absentia is easily the most influential album (for me) in the past decade or so; it deserves to be heard.
B00005JKPF|3.0|You've all the heard the saying that too many cooks spoil the broth. . .well X-Men 2, or to give it it's proper title, X2, has the same problem.<br />Having seen the trailer, I was full of hope for this film, but sadly it's just not as good as the original X-Men movie. It's not a bad film at all, but it could and should've been so much more.<br />X2's main problem is that it has too many main characters. Where as in the first film, you had Xavier, Jean Grey, Cylcops, Wolverine, Rogue, Storm, and Magneto and his small band of baddies, this time you've got all of the orginal good Mutants, plus a whole raft of new ones. . . and it's just all too many. Apart from Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, who has the most screen time, none of the other main cast get much of a look in. <BR>Halle Berry and Famke Jansen are woefully underused, James Marsden's Cyclops barely features, and Patrick Stewart's role  is so small and undemanding, he looks like he faxed in his performance. They could've used a mannaquin, and no one would've noticed.<br />However, along with Jackman, the real star of the film is Alan Cumming's teleporting mutant, Nightcrawler. The opening scene with Nightcrawler attempting to asassinate the US President is nothing short of astonishing FX wise, and is bordering on being truly original. But the much heralded fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is disappointing. Shot in the dark, it's difficult to see what's going on. . .maybe a nod towards the audience friendly rating the film wanted to achieve. <br />The main cause for cheer is the excess screen time given to Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, who gets to appear as \\"herself\\" for a short scene. . .much happiness from all the men in the cinema!<br />Sadly, the plot is nothing original. . .Crazy army General tries to wipe out the mutant population. . .seen it all before, I'm afraid. Brian Cox as General Stryker isn't anywhere near nasty enough to be the villain, and once again, Ian McKellen takes the gong as head baddie,even if he starts to chew the scenery while not seeming to have a clue what the film's about.<br />Overall, X2 is just about held together by Jackman's charisma and screen presence. Another sub-standard, Star Trek: Nemesis-esqe performance from Patrick Stewart puts a slight dampner on the whole film. Stewart apparantly wants nothing more to do with Jean-Luc Picard, but he can't seem to stop playing the USS Enterprise-E captain. Maybe this says something about Stewart's acting range.<br />The visual effects are excellent, and the action set-pieces are impressive, but in this day and age, that comes as standard with this sort of film. The dialogue is clunky and could've been written by a complete screenwriting novice. The only shock you'll get from X2 is the death of a much loved character by the end of the film. . .a depressing indication of what may be to come in the likely X3.
B000001C6M|5.0|Anyone cring about how simular this is to Kill'em all needs to chill. I love Kill'em all but Show no Mercy is faster and stronger for sure. If you were a true metal head back in the 80's then this album was in your tape deck all the time, i know mine was. And ontop of your tape deck was Anthrax, metallica, iron maiden and maybe some early megadeath. Show no mercy has the Sickest riff's, Judice screems, Tight recording and that 80's vintage feel that makes this album serpass any 2000 release from slayer. Me and my friends still find this to be one of our fav slayer albums of all time. EVERY song on this one rips! Deffenatly no track filtering here!!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I liked the 1st movie a lot. BUT I LOVE THIS ONE!! I got it for my son, but I must admit that I love it. The FXs are great and the story is very good. My son likes it as well [he's 4yrs old] and was not scared by the spiders or snake. [Of course, now he wants a flying car... :) ]
0553103547|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. Then read it aloud to my husband on a road trip. The characters are perfectly detailed, not too much or too little. The storyline keeps getting more interesting as you go, but you get hooked in the first few pages.<br />What's great is that the next books are wonderful too. The series as a whole isn't downsliding! It's so refreshing to read a series that keeps going strong and moving forward. I even find myself switching allegiances with the characters as the books go on.<br />Thanks George R.R. Martin!
B000068TPN|4.0|I found the title of this movie to be very interesting.  I haven't read the book, so I can't verify this, but the title to me points out the fact that the soldiers in this war were, in fact, soldiers: most did not have much policy-making authority, and did not choose to engage in what many felt was an ... unnecessary war.  They were not involved in politics.  Instead, they were there to do what they had been required to do.  They were soldiers.  It also brought to the fore how non-soldiers, through chance, became soldiers themselves.<br />The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, and it is full of gripping scenes.  It helps viewers to get a feel for what it must have been like to be there.  When the soldiers are pinned down, surrounded, and outnumbered, it is a very tense film to watch.  In fact, the action scenes are uniformly good, and the acting is excellent also.  We Were Soldiers also points out some historical truths about the war that most don't realize, such as the scene when the soldiers are being taught how helicopters will be used to transport them into and out of firefights.  Most don't realize that this was the first engagement of its kind, and it's instructive to watch the soldiers react to the danger it presents.<br />...  From a purely technical standpoint, it provides some relief from the unadulterated action of the movie, much as comedy scenes in Shakespeare's tragedies do.  Second, it points out the effect that the war had on families of those called to serve, something that is not often mentioned in Vietnam movies.
B000003N7K|5.0|When my then boyfriend, now husband (and maybe that says it all!)first played this &quot;album&quot; for me, I said &quot;WHO is this? I had heard Coltrane before but had believed that he and most jazz was just too intellectual for me (had been totally into the 70's &quot;Phildelphia&quot; soul scene like the Delfonics and Moments). Then I heard this album, followed by Miles Davis &quot;Kinda Blue&quot; and Coltrane: &quot;Ballads&quot; and realized just how wrong I had been. 25 years later, I am still with my husband and still listening to this album!! What can I say - Coltrane's playing and Hartman's singing transformed what I thought about jazz. I now listen MOSTLY to classic jazz - Coltrane, Davis, Armstrong, Ellington, Ella, Billie, etc. and probably listen to THIS album at least once a week.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I wasn't expecting much out of a low-budget black-and-white comedy film.  Instead, I got a movie funny enough that I've watched all of the movies from O'Halloran.<br />Jay and Silent Bob make their debut here, minor characters who still were good enough to end up with their own movie!<br />It's not for the faint of heart, though; the humor is frequently crude and the language is harsh.  None of it is gratuitous, however.  Every time they curse, it either enhances the character, moves the plot (what plot there is) along, or just makes you laugh out loud.
B00005QW5X|5.0|It probably helped that I rented this DVD on a whim sans any expectation, but this is a bold, emotional and staggeringly creative piece of work. You'll leave feeling for the characters, especially the lead, Hedwig.<br />First off, the soundtrack would blow Moulin Rogue out of the water (imvho). Fabulous dance extravaganzas, and a script based on a somewhat offbeat theme (the homosexual protagonist has had a botched sex change operation which was a pre-requisite to marry the man he loved). An engaging narrative and a wild full-frontal assault on the clash between rhetorical and real freedom. This for me was enough to make it worth the ride. Terrific performances by everyone, especially Mitchell, the man behind the stage version himself.<br />A slight caveat...not certain whether the movie simply tapers off at the end or if that was an intended parting effect, but be aware that the \\"plot\\" as such gets abandoned about 20 mins before the end of the movie and it's up to you to decide whether what remains is a logical or aesthetic next step toward some kind of arty resolution. Works for some, doesn't for others.<br />Definitely worth a shot. At the very minimum you'll have a treat of some great music (it was rock I am told, but I digress).
B000002KD5|5.0|The decision of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie to abandon Fleetwood Mac's blues-rock heritage to merge with the California soft-rock duo of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, with Christine McVie serving as the bridge between the two, is one of the more inexplicable masterstrokes in the history of popular music.  The only thing that would have been stranger is if somehow things had been different enough that the two members for whom Fleetwood Mac was named had been the ones that departed rather than the pair that stayed the whole way through.<br />Fleetwood and McVie had never been the creative driving force behind their group, and it was Lindsey Buckingham and his devotion to the same sort of meticulously arranged music of the Beatles and the Beach Boys that created the Supergroup of the late 1970s.  More than anything else it was the exquisite harmonies that gave the new and improved Fleetwood Mac its distinctive and popular sound.  Buckingham's vision would come to fruition on &quot;Rumours,&quot; where he was clearly the dominate force in terms of the songwriting, either by himself or in concert with the rest of the group.  But on this self-titled 1975 debut album, it is really Christine McVie who shines forth.<br />Buckingham has opens the album with &quot;Monday Morning&quot; and closes with &quot;I'm So Afraid,&quot; and Nicks has the two fan favorites with her witchy &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and simple ballad &quot;Landslide.&quot;  But McVie has her best pop-soul songs ever with her hits &quot;Over My Head&quot; (#20) and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; (#11) (&quot;Rhiannon&quot; also hit #11 on the pop singles chart).  Actually, that is a pretty decent balance between the old and the new for this first time out.  The only real reason to mark this album down is that clearly &quot;Rumours&quot; is so much better.  But if you compare &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; to what else was coming out in 1975 instead of the group's high water mark, then it stands up pretty well.  Nobody else was singing harmonies like this, and when the group got back together for &quot;The Dance&quot; it was like they had never stopped singing together.  This album hit #1 in 1976, which was 197 places better than the first &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; album by Fleetwood Mac did in 1968.Nobody else was singing harmonies like this, and when the group got back together for &quot;The Dance&quot; it was like they had never stopped singing together.

B00001OH1S|5.0|Wasis Diop's day-dreamy \\"Everything..\\" and Sting's uber-husky uber-smooth rendition of \\"Windmills..\\" are reason enough to grab this fabulous compilation pronto. But that's not it, this jazzy gem from Bill Conti also offers Simone's by now popular \\"Sinner Man\\" (used in Nokia ads); a sensuous jazz piece \\"Meet Ms. Banning\\" (Russo's character in the movie) that you could relax in a moonlit balcony and sip wine to; \\"Cocktails\\", a pianist's fingers stylishly celebrating his ivory; or the under-sold \\"Quick Exit\\" that clinches the savoir-faire of this compilation with an atmospheric trumpet swan-song.<br />For the classical freaks amongst us, there are the two Gilder's compositions, as well as some terrific soothing piano on \\"Black and White x 5\\" (sadly only a minute long), the uptempo \\"Never Change\\", and the downtempo \\"Goodnight..\\"<br />Brosnan and Russo exploded through the silver screen in this slick humdinger of a movie and this soundtrack does complete justice to that passionate chemistry. What can I say. A must for every music fan!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Anyone who has said that rock is dead has not heard this album. I haven't heard an album this part of me since Smashing Pumpkins &quot;Siamese Dream,&quot; although the albums are very different. The guitar style is a bit reminiscent of Billy Corrigan in his better days, but this album is less produced, as it should be. The level of production suits their style to a tee. At times the album sounds like it's straight out of the 60's and yet it is still very modern.<br />I definitely agree with many of the reviewers who have rated this album very high.
B00005JKZU|4.0|Though and outstanding movie, the \\"Two Towers\\" fails somewhat when compared to the first.  Unlike \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" the movie departs - quite drastically at times - in several places.  In retrospect, it would have worked out better had Peter Jackson stayed closer to the book, in both a theatrical and dramatic sense.<br />The first major departure was the activity of Treebeard, and the debate of the Ents.  In the movie, Pippen and Merry convince Treebeard to take them close to Saruman's stronghold, where Treebeard sees the devastation of Orthanac and the surrounding forest.  The whole scene plays pretty hokie.<br />In the book, Treebeard is already considering action against Saruman - Pippen and Merry simply give him a nudge over the edge, so to speak.  All in all, the movie version comes off pretty bad.<br />The encounter with Faramir is another departure that would have been done better had it followed the book.  Faramir is a poingant counterpoint to his brother Boromir, and is not corrupted by the lure of the Ring's power.  He let's Frodo and Sam go.  In the movie, he drags them to daddy.<br />Some of the character development begins to unravel in the second movie as well.  Aragorn's portrayal is weakend by the loss of Boromir (mainly because the two actors plying the respective parts are good, and work well off of one another).  Galadriel gets more and more bizzare in her actions (the whole \\"witchy-elf\\" couunterpoint that Jackson puts in goes a bit too far).  Pippen and Merry end up looking more like communist revolutionaries then meek hobbits.<br />Also, much of the weaknesses of the first movie are carried off into the second.  Much of the acting is too staged, phoney, or the timing is rushed.  Some actions and dialog seem overblown or \\"overtly\\" heroic.<br />However, many of the new characters introduced are very well done.  Theoden is well acted and well scripted, as are Grima Wormtongue, and Eowyn (who's quite hot, I might add).  Arwen plays moreprominatly in this installment as well (see \\"hot\\" comment above) and much of the tension and turmoil within the mind and soul of Aragorn is explained as well.  Gollum is extremely well written and played.  They did a pretty good job with Treebeard, in addition to providing more \\"comic\\" exposure for Gimli as well.<br />I recommend buy the extended edition of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" before getting this installment.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Ok, maybe it's a little premature to put Jack White on the Mt Rushmore of 60s guitar gods, but his output hangs with Clapton's Cream, Page's Yardbirds, Ray Davies' Kinks, and brings the punk ferocity and blues authenticity that not one of these rapmetal dudes can credibly pull off.   The first two tracks are worth the price of the CD alone, and even the overreaching fuzz and yelps of 'There's no home for you here' manages to make me smile and think fondly of Freddie Mercury and Brian May at their over-the-top best.  But as much as Jack and Meg are accused of playing characters in a throwback blues/punk movie (they are) this album just flat out ROCKS from start to finish.  Ball and Biscuit is the best extended heavy blues jam I've heard in many years, and the quieter songs work nicely as well. The liner notes ARE expectedly nutty but forgivable in their earnestness to be taken as ramblings of the seventh son of Son House.<BR>  A true story that illustrates that we oldsters (37) should have hope for our youth.  I played this all the way through very loudly for 4 14 year olds at the beginning of a 4 hour car trip.  No one asked to turn it down or skip a song.  Then one of them slipped me the new Linkin Park CD.  We got about 3 songs into that before a couple asked for a volume reduction, and then 3 more tracks until a new CD was offered.<BR>One last suggestion for Meg White - I don't care if you're his sister or his ex or his momma, just keep Courtney Love as far away as possible from Jack.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Big deal.  Just what is this suppose to be; music for automated systems that put you on hold?  How can anybody listen to this without becoming 100% bord?  I'd rather buy a sound effects CD at least there is variety there.
B00008VGL6|4.0|Depeche Mode being my favourite band, of course i was looking forward to this release. the ballads on the depeche albums sung by martin gore were always a highlight for me. I love his voice but i think that his strengths lie in his lyrics. Of course on this solo cd these are covers, so i think that takes away a little for me. Also - and i hate to agree with this- i do think what the amazon.com reviewer said is true about this collection--martin does not sing a lot of these songs with great emotion.or at least the emotion we're used to getting from him.Could it be because he didn't compose them?- i don't know. this is a great collection of songs, my faves are \\"stardust\\", \\"loverman\\" and \\"in my time of dying\\". i think Gore did an awesome job of making them his own.overall this is a great cd, definately worth buying just for his uniquely beautiful voice, but no, i'm sorry' its not as good as his first solo album.
B000021YQV|2.0|I've heard so many of these songs on pop-radio stations (that my co-workers insist on listening to, blah), I have a hard time believing they can really be considered &quot;metal.&quot;<br />The lyrics are down-right weird.  Sure some are funny, but the songs sound like a melting cesspool of lyrical garbage.  I think the song &quot;Aerials&quot; sums the cd up well.  Listen to it.  It tries to sound serious, but the lyrics make it a stupid joke of a song.  Perhaps I'm taking this group too seriously.  Then again, if I'm not supposed to take them seriously, they should be giving the CD away instead of charging any form of money.<br />Sorry, this isn't metal in my book.  I'd give this a new genre... Pop-Metal Infusion.  That sounds good.  It couldn't be Metal-Pop Infusion because there's WAY more pop than metal in this cancer-causing CD.  I liked the old SoaD, but this is just sell-out repetitive garbage I'd expect to hear from Blink 182 once they actually grew some balls.  I swear I found the recipe for this cd...<br />1 cup of Pop garbage  <BR>3 cups of distortion pedals<BR>3 cups of &quot;hardcore&quot; riffs <BR>Dash of Chuck E. Cheese's<br />Toss in blender and set to &quot;puree&quot;. Add to 250 gallon vat of sour cream, mix well and enjoy by the bucket-full. *gag*
B00008OLYN|5.0|Damnation is the sequel/prequel to the heavier death growl latent Deliverance. Based solely in acoustic based harmonies with Mikael exploring only his more majestic vocal offerings Damnation has to be one of the most beautiful (albeit softest) Opeth releases to date - which isn't a bad thing, not a bad thing at all!

6301969588|3.0|Director Tod Browning's 1932 film \\"Freaks\\" centers on the lives of actual deformed circus performers.  The plot resembles an evil Gulliver attacking Lilliput and the Lilliputians win.  The film exploits the circus performers' deformities, and the deformed circus performers' group cohesiveness is the film's plot.  This classic film never has been remade.<br />Historically the United States' strength has been that it was a 'melting pot' -- diverse peoples immigrated to the United States to become citizens of a prosperous and united country.  Recently the United States increasingly is a collection of societal groups defined by ethnicity, gender, religion and age.  Personal and family history are a strong and important foundation for personal development, but dissension among societal groups weakens United States' society.<br />I believe that increased energy costs, security issues, and possibly epidemiological concerns will make future travel and mobility within the United States more expensive and less convenient.  Less travel and mobility will make United States' society increasingly regional, parochial and stagnant.  Less travel and mobility will make *devisive* regional and group identities (and contention for resources) increasingly important.  Nationwide broadcast entertainment will counter this devisive trend somewhat, but I believe the overall result will be further weakening of United States' society.

B00005ALNQ|4.0|While the film \\"Excalibur\\" faithfully portrays the classic Arthurian legend, \\"First Knight\\" is a visual showcase that highlights Richard Gere's boyish charm.  The 1995 film has impressively elaborate sets and costumes, and Richard Gere's roguish Lancelot portrayal develops that character far beyond legend.  Ben Cross (\\"Chariots of Fire\\") gives a great villainous performance, Julia Ormond plays a warm and dutiful Guinevere, and Sean Connery (\\"Medicine Man\\") plays a fatherly King Arthur.<br />The film's title is ironic.  'First Night' refer's to a medieval ruler's 'first night' rights -- the right to first bed a bride on her wedding night.  A medieval ruler (King, local nobleman or landholder) had complete power (military and/or economic) over his subjects' lives, including the right to specify who could marry (whom).  'First night' rights were a recurring reminder of that power, a reminder that medieval rulers' subjects accepted with hatred, scorn and fear.  Yet the plot of \\"First Knight\\" revolves around the relationship between warm dutiful Guinevere and roguish Lancelot, with a disappointed fatherly King Arthur watching.<br />Society has changed.  The father literally should be 'first knight' to his wife and children, but easy separation and divorce breaks family relationships.  The film \\"First Knight\\" reinterprets medieval rulers' historical []rights as Sean Connery's noble fatherly ruling style, a style that itself is becoming increasingly rare.  In the Twenty-First Century a separated/divorced father's role often is limited to paying bills, a role carrying nobility but little authority.
0688163173|2.0|Just finished reading Shutter Island, the latest Dennis Lehane novel for which I've waited two years and scooped up in hardcover -- I won't be doing that again!  His latest novel has a terrific pretense...two federal marshals are summoned to an insane asylum on a fortress island during a hurricane -- what could be better for chills and thrills, right?  Wrong.  The fact that I waited two years for a novel which could be finished in three hours (325 pages with lots of dialogue) seems more like a novella than an actual novel.<br />BUT that aside, the story was okay at best.  I know that the author is spending much of his time working on the movie adaptation of Mystic River, as well as trying to buy back the movie rights to the first Kenzie/Gennaro novel, so perhaps that explains why so little effort (apparently) went into this latest story.  While it had unlimited potential, the story came across as farfetched -- extremely farfetched -- with holes you could drive Sean Penn's trailer through.  The ending was the best part of the book, but still it had a cliched ring to it.  It just didn't jibe.  The story meanders along for the first half and then the reader is taken along for a twisting ride which culminates in a dead end -- with a handful of implausible scenarios thrown in for good measure.  I won't ruin the ending, but when you get there, you'll know what I mean.<br />Dennis Lehane should go back to the characters that made him great -- Kenzie &amp; Gennaro -- and concentrate on his &quot;art,&quot; not his Hollywood hype.
B00008AY3L|1.0|Some people of earth wonder why my followers and I decided to rendezvous with an alien spaceship that was traveling behind the Hale Bopp comet?<br />Of course I foresaw the coming of an album called 'Diamonds on the Inside' by a man called Ben Harper. I dare not call him a musician, for he is not one.<br />Come rock with us in space.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I have been privileged to be one of the first few to watch X2 before it's actually shown in the US.<br />Being a comic and X-men fan, I definitely can say that this was not \\"sophomoric\\" or a bad follow-up. In fact, I was not disappointed by this movie, just like Two Towers was for The Fellowship of the Ring.<br />Yeah, sure, Bryan Singer jumbles the characters and story arcs around but I think he has done such a fine job of \\"maximizing\\" all these plots and sub-plots such that he is able to make a more acceptable and mainstream understanding of the overall theme. <br />What's more, he has put on so many layers which made the texture of the story and the movie richer and grander. So despite the negative news on the set, all their efforts, I believe, paid off with the end result.<br />I am specifically pleased at how Bryan Singer handles the beginning of the Phoenix saga. Most of us fans have been waiting for this story arc to finally come to the big screen. To be honest, I was saddened when I saw the first few X2 trailers since it didn't show any indication that they would be using the possession of Jean Grey. Boy, was I wrong!<br />The only thing that I didn't like was James Marsden's acting! It was good enough that they kept him out of the movie most of  the time but when he would go on screen it was hilarious.<br />Anyway, if you've chosen to read this review, don't blame me for ruining your surprise. As for those who accidentally read the spoilers, well, sorry and hope you still get a kick when you see the movie.<br />Here's looking forward to X3 and hope it comes very soon because I'd definitely would love to see Dark Phoenix toast a planet or too!<br />So to all Americans, on May 2 and the coming weekend, please make X2 gross higher than Spiderman (which is definitely a far less inferior film than this one).
B00004RF9B|5.0|This is classic 1950's science fiction at its best. The plot plays a lot like an old Star Trek episode -- the crew journeys to a seemingly safe planet; they encounter trouble and have to figure out the problem in order to get away with their lives. <br />Leslie Nielson, Walter Pigeon and Anne Francis put in great performances. Seeing a much younger Leslie Nielson in a more serious role is refreshing. Forbidden Planet was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 for Best Special Effects but lost out to the other film nominated in the category, The Ten Commandments. The electronic score is truly out-of-this-world and really makes the movie. <br />I particularly enjoyed the painted scenery/backdrops and the laser fire drawn onto the film (sometimes not lined up quite right) as well as the movie poster (DVD cover) not being quite true to the story line. After you've seen the movie, check it out and you'll see what I mean.<br />The story was fun, though definitely dated. If you enjoy old science fiction, then this is a good movie for you. Don't expect the plot to be too deep or thought-provoking, though the premise of the movie does give something to think about. This is a fun, entertaining movie from the 50'. <br />The DVD doesn't have much in the way of extras. There's just a theatrical trailer that gives away too much of the film. <br />This is a classic science fiction movie that I could easily watch again (several times). <br />Recommend: Yes<BR>Watch again: Yes
0385504209|5.0|This book completely blew my mind.  It is not often that I read a novel that had me immediately, after reading the last page, running to my computer to research the secret societies, symbols and other topics of this book.  I found it very intriguing and exciting.  It is definitely a book that makes you think and I wouldn't consider it a light fast read, although not being able to put it down myself, it didn't take me long to finish it.  Definitely one of those books that you wish could last another 300 pages. A MUST READ!!!!
B00003CX8J|2.0|X-men had hardly ANY action. It was 95% dialougue. I grew up watching X-MEN, and this movie felt more like a prequel in all-out character development than anything else. All this movie involved ... was side-story after side-story, explanations for the X-men. Since there are so many X-men, you've gotta obviously establish characters, but this movie NEEDED more action! Also, that one-liner by Storm toward the end, about what happens to a toad when he gets struck by lightning??, was just terrible and cheesy! If a piece of wood gets struck, it won't get electrocuted, give me a break! Besides those mindless flaws, Wolverine hardly faught in the whole movie! What happened to his killer-instict animal-violent persona?! We didn't see any of that until the end, which by that point was too lacking a climax to really ENJOY more than we could have! <br />Also, X-MEN 2 looks to be so much better in the action, visual department. But they really SHOULD involve GAMBIT and BEAST in the third X-MEN, that is if they do want to bring absolute, true justice to world-wide fans, and the actual comic-story before Hollywood got involved. I also miss the cool, yellow and black custome that Wolverine used to wear in the comic book and TV series. That would be awesome if they had him switch into something more wicked cool instead of this leather, plastic-looking jump-suit night-gear. <br />In conclusion, the first one was just boring, especially coming from the guy who directed USUAL SUSPECTS. The original X-men truly NEEDED much more action and they also needed better, more wild, (maybe more violent) and especially creative FIGHT SEQUENCES! The first X-Men was just weak, even though it did a good job at establishing who was who in the group. Even still, it was not really something I could sit through again, as it almost ... due to lack of almost any ACTION. Something for the director and writers to acknowledge if they care about the... um, triology? But I think X-Men 2 does address some of these issues just by looking at the previews. It would be nice to know someone will address the other as well.
B00008IXAR|4.0|So what happens when your record company drops you after a couple of disappointing selling cds in \\"Blue\\" and \\"Love and the Russian winter\\"?<br />Answer: Set up your own label (Simplyred.com) and get back to basics with an album sure to please long time Simply Red fans and possibly, just possibly help restore their place in the world charts.<br />Interestingly, their old label, Warner music, is licensed to distribute this cd(in Europe for starters), perhaps knowing they might hit the jackpot this time.<br />As soon as I heard the lead off single \\"Sunrise\\", (sampling \\"I can't go for that\\" by Hall and Oates) with a chorus that sticks in your head, I've been eagerly anticipating the rest of the album. By and large it hasn't let me down.<br />Here's a brief critique of all the tracks:<br />Home- Just like \\"Holding back the years\\", something in this song makes me want to remember my younger days. The fact that Micks singing about lost love, he yearns for the \\"safety\\" of  familiar surroundings. A nice easy listening tune to start of with (8/10)<br />Fake- The pace picks up a bit here. Add some brass and backing \\"doo doo doos\\" that could be lifted off \\"Baby I need your lovin'\\". Kinda retro yet contemporary. The musicianship here is first rate. It's also great to hear live drums on most of the tracks. (9.5/10)<br />Sunrise- Great song. Heard it heaps and never tire of it. For once, a sample that is used to great effect. Top 10 in the UK, I hope this repeats that success world wide. (10/10)<br />You make me feel brand new- A cover of the classic \\"Stylistics\\" song. A pretty faithful version is all I can say about it. However, his voice is sounding better than ever. (8/10)<br />Home loan blues- Almost re-visits the \\"Money's too tight to mention\\" theme with a groove not too dissimilar. Absolutely love the line \\"You can have it all- but you gotta pay\\". Nice sax solo too. (8.5/10)<br />Positively 4th Street- Yes- it's the Bob Dylan classic! Now this is done with a nice little twist. First its just his voice with violins. Then the acoustic guitar kicks in- with some \\"country\\" touches. Later on a full on brass section plays! Not sure what Dylan would think of this, but I think this is a great version (9/10)<br />Lost Weekend- Highlight of the album!!! The Brand New Heavies will think someones ripped them off!!! Acid Jazzy feel that beautifully compliments Mick's voice. I can imagine crusing the highway in a convertable to this. Just makes me feel happy. (10/10)<br />Money- Seems a re-current theme. Either money or girl problems. This is maybe the only \\"darker\\" song on the album. Probably the only song I don't really like. (6/10)<br />Something for you- At 6.00 minutes long ,this starts of sounding like \\"Brother Louie\\", that morphs into a rousing Motown like chorus only for it to go all laid back and jazzy (complete with an extended cool electric organ and Santana like guitar solo). Sensational!!!!  Waiter, can I have a martini please.(10/10) <br />It's you- A lovely song to complete the album (I don't think the 53 second reprise of \\"Home\\" really adds much). Certainly one for romantics. (8.5/10)<br />I hope I've been able to paint an accurate picture of this album. Long time fans should be happy with this and anyone looking for a mature pop record can't go wrong with this one. Highly recommended!!!
B00008CLOA|5.0|This album has unbelievable musical talent and poetry put into one. It also incredibly is parralell to the Wizard of Oz. Even though the album isn't as long as the movie you can still play it paralell to both halves of the movie! You also probably know that this is the best selling album of all time even before anyone knew it went with the Wizard of Oz. You'll always have good music to listen to when the lyric talent of Roger Waters and guitar talents by David Gilmour. When you listen to this you will see why this is the best selling album in history!!!
0962477060|5.0|The only series of guitar lesson books you will ever need. I've have bought, read and tried to understand many books on guitar theory and have only come away with a confusing, unrelated, and academic idea of how to relate to the fretboard as a workable entity. This book takes music theory and lets you see it through the eyes of guitar and allows you to appreciate the versatility of the instrument by means of it's unique tuning.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Don't let the title track though you off, this album is AMAZING! I had doubts about buying this album but I am so happy I did!  These tracks really kick butt and it's not what you are expecting, very little of this album is techno, and even the technoish songs are not harsh.  I love every track, with the exception of the title track (though I like the club mixes of it), this album is in one word BEAUTIFUL!
B00005YW4H|1.0|LEMME SAY SOMETHIN'. WOT DO U SEE IN THIS CD? IS SO BORING. DONT BUY IT. U CAN BUY INSTEAD OF IT 'SONGS IN A MINOR'. NORAH JONES HASN'T GOT VOICE....NORAH...BUH BAI...
B000002VMH|5.0|What makes Annie Lennox so cool is that she makes such wondserfully catchy beautiful music without submitting her soul to the cliches &amp; insipid formulas of pop music.  There are some great unexpected surprises on here, such as world drumming &amp; the tongue-in-cheek &quot;Keep Young &amp; Beautiful&quot; [if you want to be loved...].  I really feel like her music is something she does for herself creatively &amp; not just something she produces for other people to spend money on.

B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard of Evanescence while watching the Daredevil movie.  During the funeral scene, there is a song playing with an absolutely angelic voice singing.  That voice turned out to be the voice of Amy Lee, lead vocalist of Evanescence.  The Wind-Up Records debut is arguably the best of any of the current mainstream Wind-Up artists, including Creed and 12 Stones.<br />The first single on the album, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; was also featured on the Daredevil soundtrack, along with the previously mentioned &quot;My Immortal&quot;.  The album shows a techno/nu-metal prevalence along with the amazing vocals from Lee.  The co-founder of Evanescence, Ben Moody is simply amazing on the guitar.  His style hints at a range and depth of play that has not been exposed to the public yet.<br />The passionate nature of the songs on the album make it so enjoyable to listen to.  Lee's unearthly, silky-smooth vocals fill in the gap where, I believe, many nu-metal outfits are lacking.  She makes you believe she is indeed pouring her heart and soul into singing.  The lyrics have depth and melodies and beats are well thought-out and effective in portraying a picture of a painful, dark world.  However, there is hope in the darkness of the bands world.<br />There are two ballads on the album, &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; and they are welcome changes of pace.  Amy Lee's voice complements the piano very well, and the songs have real emotion that cannot be discribed.<br />Bottom line, if you liked &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; when you heard it on the radio, get Fallen.  You will not be disappointed.  When you get the album, the next step is to see them live.  I just saw them live on April 29th, and it was the best concert I have ever been to.  They are even better live than in the studio.
B000002J6H|5.0|Just listen to Stills playing &quot;Black Queen&quot; on his drop C tuned vintage Martin.  It is an acoustic equivalent of Clapton on the Beano album.  This is the sound of acoustic blues rock.  Shame no later guitarist seems to have carried the torch where Stills left off.  By the way, it is clearly Clapton playing the solo on &quot;Go Back Home&quot; with his Brownie Stratocaster; but the Crybaby intro and riffs are unmistakably Stills, probably on his Gretsch, sounding absolutely gorgeous.  Blusier than Clapton on this track, in fact.  The rumour has it that Clapton wanted Stills to join his come-back band in 1974.  If true, then it is not difficult to see why here.  Was that true, Stephen?
B00008I8IF|4.0|some songs are just okay but there really isn't a bad song on the disc.  i like all the jayhawks albums and this one is one of my favorites from them.  i highly recommend sound of lies and tommorrow the green grass.
1891252089|5.0|I bought this book to help me develop my home practice after about a year of taking instructor led classes. Therefore I was familiar with many of the Ashtanga poses. The book includes detailed description of each pose including alternatives for less advanced students, breath instructions for each movement, and drishti. The instructions include all poses for primary series, secondary series, and finishing poses. Then what I found extremely valuable is a couple of pages that list the sequences pictorially, i.e. Primary series flow, Secondary series flow. Plus David Swenson constructed a few shorter series for either less advanced students or for a shorter practice. Swenson also talks about the other elements of physical yoga (bandas, breath control, vinyasa), as well as the notion that the physical practice comes within a greater context. I don't know if it would be difficult to learn these poses from scratch without any formal instruction. But if you are really looking for a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; or manual to refine your Astanga practice, this is a wonderful book.
B00008VGK0|4.0|The new CD single \\"American Life\\" is a little controversial and a bit irreverent but awesome. The dance mixes rock, like usual. Madonna is always in the fore front of dance and club music. Some version have bad words in them, this one is the definitely not for the 18 and under. American Life is a must for all you dance crazed fans... Also included a version of \\"Die Another Day\\".
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you watch this movie expecting to see Lion King or Alice in Wonderland, then don't waste your time. For children AND adults with a taste for something new, different and even genuinely scary - sit back, dim the lights, and get ready to take a journey the likes of which Disney animated features never quite reach.<br />This is not a typical Western-oriented story. It is, almost literally, the work of one man. Miyazaki is a Master of storytelling, and injects a sense of realism in this fantastical world that makes it all the more entertaining and even more memorable than some \\"classics\\".  <br />Over two hours long, there is much more story development and true scariness than many young children can stand, so take heed. Even for those who are fed up with the steady stream of anime, this is nothing like what is bombarding the airwaves. There are real characters here - some good and some bad - but no one to hate. Also, some characters that are quite scary, yet turn out to be not so bad after all. Morality even children can appreciate.<br />Japanese animation has come far in 40 years, when \\"Alakazam\\" was first Westernized for American viewing. Whomever ordered that the Disney studios were not permitted to change a single frame of this movie deserves a great deal of gratitude. This is truly a classic to enjoy over and over.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is truly a stellar album.  When a friend initially recommended it to me I disregarded the suggestion.  Frankly I didn't give this band a lot of credit for White Blood Cells(although I find myself enjoying it more and more), I kind of passed them off as another ... garage band.  Now I see they are much more talented than those poser[s]... Why?  Well for one they get so much out of the sparse instrumentation they use, pumping out great dirty, punky blues.  And they are genuine, not a bunch of rich prep school pricks who decided to don leather jackets, tight jeans, and greasy hair just to sell out to all the college scenesters ...  This is right up there with Coldplay, Interpol, Wilco, Beck, Idlewild, Blur, and all those other rock critic darlings(justifiably so).  Seriously though, buy it, it deserves a place next to your Steve Madden shoes and low cut Diesel jeans you damn scenesters.
B00008VGL6|4.0|This album is very, very good......Martin Gore has such deep emotions in his voice and I really like the song chioces.  I did know most of the tracks (they are covers) before I get the album so it was very fresh for me.  Musically, it is similar to Depeche Mode's Exciter but a little more interesting.  I do wish there were a few more driving beats a la Violator but I can respect that Martin is more interested in electronic textures and atmospheres than dance beats.  I bet Dave Gahan will take care of that when he releases his solo album this June.  Overall, this is an excellent CD that capture all the things I like about Martin Gore and Depeche Mode.  The romance, the pain, the longing, the twistedness.  This is definately an album to light a candle too and listen to in the dark with someone you love.
B000002UEB|5.0|I reviewed this album before, when I first got it, but I felt I should review it again, because my previous review did not even come close to doing it justice.  I was immediately impressed by the story, but for some reason the music took a bit longer to sink in.  I enjoyed it right away, but it just felt like something was missing.  It was good music, but I didn't see it as brilliant.  Then, after many listens, it hit me.  This is perhaps the most musically perfect concept album ever made.<br />You see, when I first got this album, I was expecting an experience along the lines of Dream Theater's &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;.  More heaviness, more technicality, just...more.  Then I realized something:  this is not that kind of album.  Sure, you've got your fast solos and what not, but the technical bombast usually associated with progressive metal is nary to be found here, and really it doesn't need to be.  The musicians all do a fine job, and they only do what is exactly necessary, and it works.  It allows for the story to take form, without the music serving as a distraction.  I recently got Pain of Salvation's &quot;Remedy Lane&quot;, and while it is musically well-executed, I feel that there's just too much going on.  There's nothing wrong with a strong degree of diversity, but when put into the context of a concept album, it can just be detrimental.  Not the case here.  The music suits the storyline perfectly, and enhances it, rather than overpowers it.<br />And, as for the story itself, well, it is nothing short of brilliant.  I won't go into the specific details, because a. part of the fun of getting a concept album is figuring out the story for yourself, and b. there are plenty of reviews here that already gave it away. :)  But anyway, this story is fantastic.  It's got it all:  Emotion, meaning, political significance, and originality. At this point, I would say that it is the greatest story ever told on CD (&quot;The Wall&quot; being a close second).  Don't get me wrong, I love the story of SFAM, and it is my favorite album, but I would rank this story a bit higher, as it is more original.  But really, I don't like comparing those two albums.  Both are brilliant, but in different ways.<br />Let's see, what else?  Oh yes, Geoff Tate.  The man is just an incredible singer, and his vocals really bring the story to life.  His power and range are astonishing, and when it comes to pure emotion, few can convey it like Tate.  His duet with Pamela Moore (&quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot;) is just amazing.  Moore is an excellent vocalist herself, and these two singing together is quite magical.  But really, this entire album is amazing.  Not a weak spot to found.<br />So there you have it.  It took me a while to figure it out, but I finally saw the light. This is one of the greatest albums ever made, and there's nothing else like it.  If you enjoy well-played intelligent music, this is an album you should not be without.  Buy it, love it, worship it.  It will change your life.on't get me wrong, I love the story of SFAM, and it is my favorite album, but I would rank this story a bit higher, as it is more original.

B000005RFQ|2.0|This does contain a couple of good songs, but really people a 4 star average? First of all, remaster or not the production is completely TERRIBLE considering how fantastic Mob Rules sounded. Zero the Hero is about the only song I &quot;return&quot; for, it does have a nice groove, and going years without hearing this disc doesn't bother me. I return every 3 or so years hoping THIS is the year where I get a lot out of it, but sadly it isn't. My love for Tony is the only reason I persevere. The biggest thing holding this disc back is the fact that Ian simply doesn't fit. The lyrics are so blatantly written by someone who doesn't understand this sort of music and his sound just doesn't mesh with the music. Ironic to think at this very moment in 1983, RJD is conjuring up one of the greatest cd's of the era in Holy Diver, make that ANY era:)
B000084T18|5.0|This CD is great...the lyrics are awesome and his ryhmes are sick...definitly worth buying...

0810945797|5.0|The Dark Crystal... one of the most beautiful films created by two of the most talented artists our culture has ever seen- Jim Henson and Brian Froud. I collect Froud's books, and receieved the orginal edition of The World of the Dark Crystal last year for my Winter Solstice gift. If you are a Froud or Dark Crystal collector, but you aren't quite obsessed enough to search for months for this book, and then pay [dollar amount] for it (coughcoughME)--- this book is your salvation! Not only is the artwork brighter, and the paper of better quality, but the new cover is stunning, it features a lovely new forward and the fascinating promo book in the back. However--- If you already own the orginal copy of this book, and are looking forward to the 15 new artworks that the new version promises, I must warn you: THERE IS NO NEW MATERIAL IN THIS BOOK ASIDE FROM THE PROMO BOOK. I don't know how this happened, especially since it says right in the jacket that there ARE 15 new artworks. There is work that wasn't in the book before in the forward, but the only image no one's ever seen is the photo of Jen and Kira. While the new book is certainly exquisite, I was disappointed at this. I don't regret having purchased the book, however- for I'm very adement in my Froud collecting and seek to own every bit of Froud merchandise that comes my way. :) :) :) I hope this was helpful to all of you! Blessed Be!
B000002UB3|2.0|There are a few good songs on this album, which I bought upon its release in 1969, including Here Comes the Sun.<br />On the second side was an attempt at a long run of songs that flow one to the next to the next, but it really doesn't work that well.  This is because the songs aren't really songs, but short samples of unfinished works that can't stand on their own.<BR>Pink Floyd got this concept right with Dark Side of the Moon, with full length songs.<br />Overall OK.
B000068PQ0|5.0|let me start by saying this album is amazing.  i feel blessed to have found it.  television and radio fell short of delivery.  i was lucky enough to catch beck this past halloween at the beacon theatre.  the flaming lips were his opening act AND his band and i was completely blown away...the beautiful things they did to my ears and eyes.  i went home immediately to put this cd in heavy rotation burning copies for all of my friends as well.  nothing but rave reviews thus far*
B000001BZT|4.0|Actually, I give this one:<br />---<br />4.5 Stars<br />---<br />---<br />The first time I heard the title tune, I knew it was a hit.  Much had changed between his previous album and this, his third.  The country hillbilly influence was still there, but the twang guitar had given away to a hard rocking, driving guitar.  The sound on this album is at times huge, as witnessed by the big bass impacts on the title track.  The change in production, coupled with a change of mucical direction made for a totally new sound.<br />Critics christened Copperhead Road as Earle's rock album, but that was gross oversimplification.  Sure, half of the tunes did rock, some of them to more effect than many bands that were trying so hard to rock.  But it was the contrast given by the ballads that makes Copperhead Road memorable.  Check out \\"Nothing But A Child\\" or \\"Even When I'm Blue\\", both excellent tunes, both excellent counterbalances to rockers such as Snake Oil.  Classic disc.

B00008977N|3.0|This was my favorite video concert for a very long time and was ecstatic to see that it was coming out on DVD.  Well I played it through my DTS sound system and it sounded great, but my Wega Flat Screen (ran through RGB) did not like good, more like broken up mosaic pieces of video.  I have over 50 DVD's and this is the first one that has ever broken down like this.  Now I did take it to my friends house and played it on a 3 gun projector and it looked fine, what gives, I do not know?  My Synopsis: it looks good on VHS, but on DVD only the sound is full proof and the video,,, well I do not know why is falls apart on my system as many others after looking at several reviews.
B000002J09|2.0|Rock n' Roll, Stairway, When the Levee Breaks.  That's it.  Three good songs out of only eight on the album.  The lead on Rock n' Roll is great, but most second year guitar students can bang it out.<br />This album is adequate.  It brings back good memories.  But so do hundreds of others.<br />Buy the Led Zep Early Days and Latter Days series and you get all three good songs on this album, plus the rest of what you need from this group.<br />Three songs out of eight equals 2 stars.
B00005JLSC|5.0|at long last the movie version of one of the best musicals finally comes to the silver screen and boy was it worth the wait! the whole cast are simply perfect and everything essence of the show is kept in tact , I have seen it twice and it gets better everytime , Ignore the foolish reviews this is a really good film and well worth your time.

B000060P79|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I have ever bought.  Most bands start off a little shaky with their first CD.  Not Simple Plan.

There are also other really good songs like &quot;I'd do anything&quot;, &quot;I'm just a kid&quot; and &quot;One Day&quot;.  Overrall this CD rocks.  I recommend it to anyone who like Pop-Punk music.  Simple Plan rocks.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album is beautiful, from beginning to end.  Composition is perfect, every track has meaning, nothing is here that shouldn't be.  From the minute you put it in, it's an experience.  I was thinking Fallen would be my fave album this year, but then I find myself muttering the words in my head all day.  It's short, but VERY sweet.  When LP released this CD it was for their fans, which if you don't dig techno/rap/rock you probably won't like this.  If you're like me and can relate to some of the lyrics, they're very powerful and emotional like &quot;From the Inside&quot; or &quot;Easier to Run&quot;.  &quot;Faint&quot; and &quot;Don't Stay&quot; follow roots to Hybrid Theory with their harder sounds.  I can't really pick any favorites since I love them all.  It's hard to express in words how wonderful this CD is. Go out and buy it, it's worth every penny.
B000077VR3|1.0|One of the worst musicals ever made for the screen, the total lack of story and script is laughable and the acting is nothing more than average. And the songs? old pop songs people hated , I normally like Baz Lurmans movies but this was awful.
0156027321|5.0|This novel is one of the best novels I have ever read.  I don't  understand how anyone can call it boring.  Far-fetched, yes.  But boring, no.  I think these readers must have missed the importance of Pi's interview with the Japanese investigators.  Stunning novel.  I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it.
B000068PQ0|4.0|To say this music is joyful just begins to describe the delights to be found here. With the exception of the first and last of eleven tracks (which sound like lame attempts to be theme music to a bad TV Sit-Com) this is a wonderfully quirky, good natured, yet thematically mature, creation.  This CD will grab your ears and tickle them 'til you giggle out loud. The melodies are insanely catchy. The other day, though, while working in the yard, (after about the fifth listen) it finally occurred to me that this music comes from a place of pure peace, surrender, acceptance, and love. \\"It's Summertime\\" flowed over and through me - a gentle wave of tranquil vibrations. This song is a culmination of the prior two songs (\\"Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell\\" and \\"Are You a Hypnotist?\\") which to me form the heart of this album. The music defies description but is a seamless blend of acoustic and electric guitars, electronic treatments, subtle sampling, and (somewhat surprisingly, given the mostly laid back vibe of this album) powerful drumming and layered percussion. The vocals are a bit fey but blend perfectly with the music and lyrics. This is a pop music gem, if not a masterpiece, that's very likeable without (exceptions noted above) being the least bit sappy. I'm actually grateful to these guys for crafting such heart-warming, and obviously heart-felt, music. 4 & 1/2 Stars! Thanks Lips!
0920668372|4.0|I bought this book 16 years ago (my I'm getting old!) for my first son.  He thought it was so funny that the boy was flushing the watch down the toilet.  <br />My youngest child is 10 now and she still adores this book and reads it to her baby cousins. To this day the ending makes me cry though as he sings to his own child and the circle completes.<br />The images are perfect as they portray the mischief that children get into and that regardless a parent's love is still there.
0385486804|3.0|Jon Krakauer's Into The Wild is an exhilarating memoir of a single man-Chris McCandless-who decides to abandon his place in society to embark on a journey into the wild.  McCandless' decision to forsake his possessions and life In Atlanta, GA is buttressed by his passion for excitement and need for discovery of himself.<BR> \\"I wanted movement and not a calm course of existence.  I wanted excitement and danger and the chance to sacrifice myself for my love.  I felt in myself a superabundance of energy which found no outlet in our quiet life\\" (Leo Tolstoy, \\"Family Happiness\\").   <BR> Christopher McCandless' journey of self-discovery to Alaska is best described as realistic and stimulating.  The novel opens with Christopher's death and backtracks all the way to the beginning of his journey.  This structure grasps a tight hold of the reader, forcing them to continue reading so all their questions can be answered.<BR> On a five-star rating system, I would rate this novel a 3 because though it is adventurous and attention-grabbing, It isn't exactly my genre of choice.  I would recommend this novel to someone whom enjoys an escapade into the heart of the wild on a mission to do something electrifying and distinctive while discovering one's persona.

0385504209|1.0|Having read the glowing review in the New York Times (Jane Maslin wrote \\"Wow\\"), I had high expectations of this book.  It was a huge disappointment (\\"D'oh\\").<br />The quality of the writing is mediocre.  Sentences are cliched, characterization verges on caricature, and the structure sticks to the tired conventions of substandard thrillers.  I was struck by the dumbing down of the sentences.  It is pitched at unimaginative readers of, say, the seventh grade.  In fact, the average seventh grader is better served by reading Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew.  While there is an interesting plot filled with intriguing, esoteric detail, the dialogue is very obvious and uninspired.  This strikes a fatal blow to the characters of a very dialogue-driven book.  The characters are incredibly one-dimensional; motivations are clear and they face no serious moral conflicts.  Most of the book consists of three characters solving word puzzles in Paris and London (in the form of bad verse), interrupted by an aggressive bull-like French policeman and a homicidal albino.  The adversaries are physically coded, and the heroes are learned, attractive, PC and very dull.<br />On the positive side, there is a fairly engaging chase and plenty of information relating to secret societies and the art world.  However, these features do not rescue what is ultimately a very conventional, lukewarm thriller that - through the sheer muscle of its publisher and helpful reviewers - has undeservedly been inflicted on the reading public.  I felt quite cheated.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|...The Beatles themselves mixed the Mono tracks and their mixes were perfection. Not only didn't the Beatles mix the Stereo, the actual people who did the mixes have admitted all along, and still insist, that the stereo mixes are not very good. But the situation is much worse than that. These are not even the stereo mixes released at the time.<BR>I own British Stereo copies of every Beatle album in pressings from the 60's.  Let me be clear. I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THIS [STUFF]. In Paperback writer the instrumental track is buried. In Day Tripper, the vocals are buried. In most of the cuts, echo has been added to the vocals. For instance the up front vocals of Day Tripper should be essentially dry. Here they are dripping with echo, spoiling the track and making it literally unrecognizable to me. All the tracks are similarly spoiled. they are unrecognizable. The only conceivable reason other[s]... think this music is great is because they been sold as great in pop culture. Because these tracks are [not good]. this from a truly enthusisastic Beatles fan!!!
B000005HLV|5.0|The unrelenting guitar assualt (from Euronymous with some helpful spots from Snorre Ruch of Thorns) of this record is what makes it so damned special.  I don't care about the history, I know the politics and story and to be honest - I don't give a damn.<br />The music on this record is what matters most.  Like a train wrecking off it's tracks - this CD hammers the listener like a mallet from hell breaking off the skull.<br />Forget the slightly sloppy drumming and bizarre vocals - this CD is worth it alone to hear the amazing recording of the guitars and the weaving spell that they create.<br />As classic as any metal album ever, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas shows that black metal was first and foremost - GOOD METAL.

0790725657|5.0|I felt this was a great adapation of a much loved children's book. I enjoyed it much more than the older Shirley Temple version. The acting is good, the costumes and set believable and the interweaving of Hindu mythology that parallels the plot of the movie is nicely done. The one thing I did not like was the portrayal of Indians in the film, but this is also a fault of the book. They fell into the old stereotypes of Indians and India as exotic, mysterious, and mystical. The Indian servant of Mr. Randolph, though central to the plot, reminded me so much of portrayals of black servants and slaves in earlier movies, as servile, loyal, always smiling, wise beyond their station and years, and mysterious. Yet, I liked the racial reconcilliation portrayed in the friendship between Sarah and Becky and like how Becky is adopted by Sarah's father at the end. This is one part where I really loved this version much more than Shirley Temple's version in which so much was left unresolved.
B00005221L|5.0|I don't like to reiterate the story (the editorial review and others will do that).  Instead I like to make points on specific details to help the buyer make an informed choice.  Here's what I think are important things to look for and think about when concidering the Predator DVD;<br />THE FILM (for those who have not viewed it)<br />-I have a hard time deciding if this is a horror movie or a Sci-fi film.  It's so violent, I put it with my horror collection.<br />-Did I mention violent?  This film is not for the squeemish.  INTESTINE ALERT!!!<br />-Always compared to \\"Alien\\" and deservedly so.  Alien was a more ambitious film.  I rate them as entertainment equals.<br />-Characters are well defined and (despite not talking much) you actually care about them.<br />-Probably Arnolds most appropriate casting.  It is still uncommfortable to hear him cuss.  All the actors are asked to do very little but run and shoot alot... ...with great success!<br />-Special fx have yet to show there age.  Very well done.<br />-There is nary a slow point in the film.  If it gets quiet, it is to build tension.  First time viewing is very intense.<br />THE DVD<br />-If you want to know more about \\"Pradator\\" you won't find it here.  This is an \\"Extras Free\\" DVD.<br />-Picture quality is very good.  Not a problem,<br />-Sound quality also very good.  Definitly gives a theater feel.<br />-Packaging is simple.  Nothing of special note.<br />-This thing is a cheap date.  You get what you pay for.  I recommend shopping around.<br />So why the title?  Well, I personally feel this is a Sci-fi Horror classic that deserves the same reverence that \\"Alien\\" has received.  The film presentation is quality enough, but I certainly would have paid more for \\"the Making Of..\\" or concept art or something to educate me on the details of the films production.  I'm glad I'm able to get this wonderful film for the price of dirt, but I don't agree with it being treated like dirt as a DVD package.  Is this film really so poorly reguarded by Fox that it gets the \\"Shlub\\" treatment?  Perhaps they plan future releases giving the \\"Predator\\" its proper \\"Special Edition\\" DVD.  Unfortunately, I've already spent my money on this, highly viewable, poor-mans version.rded by Fox that it gets the \\"Shlub\\" treatment?

0800141601|5.0|(Sigh...) This movie is a great classic of romantic heroes and dastardly bad guys. It's scenery, filming, and acting are worth watching (except for maybe Julia), but I must admit the story is quite &quot;cheesy&quot; at times and some of the computer-generated scenes are slightly unbelieveable. However, Sean Connery and Richard Gere are soooo romantic (sigh) I still watch this movie repeatedly. I do not recommend it for children under the age of 10 or 12 because there is A LOT of violence in the battle and pillaging scenes, some of which involves children. The profanity is very mild, but there is some. It does deserve it's PG-13 rating.
0385508417|5.0|John Grisham does a fantastic job in describing the role of Christmas in a consumist middle high class America. As a couple whose daughter has just left them to live for a year in Peru as a missionaire chooses to skip christmas and instead go for a 10 day cruise on the caribe, the world around them seems to pull them towards the tradition. Despite the high expenses, the long lines, traffic and exhausting preparations required for the Christmas dinner, their whole world seems engulfed by the Christmas euphria, and their attempts of scape become far more complicated than they first thought. An absolutely enjoyable reading, this is one of those books you soar through anxious to know how it ends without missing a single detail.

B00008DDRX|4.0|This is still the finest racing movie ever made, and, in the light of today's restrictions, ever likely to be made.  The widescreen DVD with Dolby Surround track is long overdue.  The only problem I have with the movie itself is the difficulty in hearing the background loudspeaker announcements in my non-Dolby environment.<BR>So why only 4 stars?  The lack of any bonus material, particularly the one item that should have been included: &quot;Filming at Speed&quot;, the fine documentary about the making of the movie.  Hopefully a future release will include the documentary.<BR>Still, if you care about motor racing, do not hesitate to buy this DVD!  Then find someone with a big-screen TV and Dolby Surround to give yourself the full experience.
0440234743|5.0|John Grisham makes a great description of a family rotten by excess of money. The first character in the book is Troy Phelan, excentric 78 yr old millionaire who committs suicide leaving a handwritten testament in which he leaves noting to his sons, obviously spread amongst different families of his multiple marriages, and spoiled by himself. Despite the eccentricity of the character of Troy Phelan, or the many defects of those who follow the plot as the testament gets to be questioned by his son's to get some part of his fortune, Grisham uses a great description. This creates round characters most readers could identify themselves with in the way they percieve the world. This gets the reader fully entangled in the plot, making it an excellent book.
B00008H2LB|5.0|this cd is one of the best of the decade, let alone the year. It's wonderful. Linkin Park is one of my absolute favorite bands, and i love their music very much (i own hybrid theory, reanimation, meteora, and all the EP songs). Meteora is an awesome cd, complete with extras on the cd and all that jazz. You can feel emotion in this music, right through your body. Its the hard stuff, for sure. I'm estatic over this cd and would tell everyone in the world to get a copy because it is that good of a cd. Even if you dont love LP as much as I do, this cd is still marvelous. Its an immediate buy. Get it and listen to it! you wont regret it ever.
B000069HK2|5.0|I'm not going to break down or critique every song on the album.  All i can say is that i can pop this cd into my player and just let it go.  Every song is amazing in it's own right.  Bert McCracken finds a way of mixing his emotional screams into the lyrics, and the results are insanely great songs.  Simply awesome beats, intense lyrics and hugely worthy of purchasing.  I suppose i can end this review by stating that track 10, \\"Noise and Kisses\\" is brilliant and my favorite song on the cd.  i've used amazon many times for many cds, but never have i been so pleased with my purchase.
B000002HJA|5.0|For years, I had underrated this album. It always seemed to pale in comparison to BLUES FOR THE RED SUN and SKY VALLEY - the songs were shorter, the riffs more understated and minimal. But now, both having heard what guitarist Josh Homme has done with Queens Of The Stone Age, and from personally speaking to the members of Kyuss over the years, CIRCUS has risen highly in my estimation. <br />For their first three-and-a-half albums, Kyuss (the pride of Palm Desert, California) were powered by the nucleus of Josh Homme and drummer Brant Bjork. When these two were writing, jamming and creating, they did so with a power that awed - and sometimes frightened - anyone fortunate enough to witness it. Singer John Garcia has often said that when Bjork and Homme were brainstorming, it was unlike anything he'd ever seen or could ever hope to witness again. <br />But, when a frustrated Bjork left during the making of SKY VALLEY, Homme suddenly had the driver's seat all to himself, and the others (Garcia, bassist Scott Reeder, and drummer Alfredo Hernandez, making his Kyuss studio debut here) really looked to him to lead the way on their next album. CIRCUS finds Homme experimenting with his guitar-playing abilities: refining and trimming away the \\"fat.\\" Kyuss' songs became less monstrous and grand, mutating into something leaner and more, for lack of a better word, bouncy. Garcia has said that CIRCUS is his favorite Kyuss album, because Homme welcomed his input and encouraged him to write more. The change in drummers made a huge difference, too. Hernandez is far more steady and refined than wild-man Bjork's, keeping a more disciplined beat. (I've always felt that Bjork is just about one of the greatest drummers I've ever seen, and it's tantalizing to think just how much this album would have been a completely different animal with him behind the kit instead of Hernandez.)<br />There's still an epic that ends the disc (\\"Spaceship Landing\\"), and the groove is certainly intense there, and on the sparse and cool \\"Phototropic.\\" \\"One Inch Man\\" and \\"Gloria Lewis\\" are two of the aforementioned \\"bouncy\\" tracks, while \\"Jumbo Blimp Jumbo\\" and \\"Tangy Zizzle\\" find a bit of the old Sky Valley dust blowing in again. \\"Size Queen\\" is elephantine reggae, and Homme casually throws away two or three huge riffs in \\"El Rodeo\\" that other guitarists would sell their mothers for. Just to prove that they could mellow-out when they wanted to, they serve up a picturesque and soothing cover of Yawningman's \\"Catamaran,\\" written by Mario Lalli, Homme and Bjork's hometown hero. (Check out Lalli's Fatso Jetson albums on Amazon for some great Meat Puppets-meets-Minutemen strangeness).<br />At the time, it sounded to SKY VALLEY fans as if Kyuss were turning their backs on their heavy roots. Now it's clear that they were just moving on, growing up, and defining their style. As a guy with limited patience for cliche and tradition, Josh Homme continues to prove that he's one of the most innovative guitarists in modern music with RATED R and SONGS FOR THE DEAF. And, for a transitional album, CIRCUS really rocks in ways that continually surprise and delight.<br />As a side note: The hidden track on the album is called \\"Day One,\\" and was written by Reeder after the suicide of Kurt Cobain. It is dedicated \\"to Dave and Chris\\" on the UK \\"Demon Cleaner\\" single, and it has a mournful quality that is affecting and hard to shake. In light of the fact that this was Kyuss's final studio album, the song's air of sad finality was thoroughly appropriate.<br />Viva Kyuss!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Music is full of trend followers,Godsmack are no follower's and with this new release they forge forward solidly on a foundation of metal that harcons back to bands that have real balls and are not afraid to use them!! From the opening track &quot;Straight out of line&quot; new drummer Shannon Larkin propels the band through 45 minutes of pure fury ending beautifuly with &quot;Serenity&quot;,an emotional tribute to Rush drummer Neil Peart.This is a perfect Metal album that will remind young and old what passion and persistance can sound like!!
0060920432|3.0|According to the author, flow is a state of mind when it is totally engrossed in an activity that it looses track of itself  and becomes one with the activity being performed.  The author supports this with excerpts from interviews with people (rock climbers, artists, musicians etc) who are involved in flow-producing activities.<br />However, the author never addresses why a person would choose one flow producing activity over another or should people cram as many flow producing activities in their lives as possible.  Instead the author attempts to apply the conditions that create flow to turn even the most mundane activities into flow producing activities! In effect, he is saying, &quot;Stop whining you lot, use these techniques known to produce flow to make your job more interesting&quot;.  The author contends that people are dissatisfied because of lack of flow in their activities which gets them bored sooner or later. Cant people be bored of always being in flow too?  How is it different from being temporarily entertained by a good film?<br />The work is good in that it documents the mechanics of flow but disappoints by not discussing the role of passion/liking of the performer for his chosen activity - which is probably why he repeatedly engages in it; flow being a pleasant by-product but not an end in itself.
0321127420|5.0|Martin Fowler does it again.  He manages to capture complexities of enterprise class application development in a simple, easy to read book.<br />If you've read any of Fowler's other titles, the structure of this one will come as no surprise.  The first have of the book discusses the patterns in &quot;narrative&quot; format, and the second half presents them in reference format.  If you are new to this subject, I highly recommend reading through the narrative section to understand how the patterns fit together.<br />If you've been involved in enterprise application development before, chances are you can simply flip to the second half of the book and start skimming the patterns.  Each is only a handful of pages long and is accompanied by a description, use cases and example code.<br />Like other &quot;patterns&quot; titles, if you've been doing software development for a while you'll read the patterns and think &quot;oh.. of course, I did that in xyz project&quot;.  The patterns themselves may not be groundbreaking and chances are you've seen them in some form, but having a well documented reference of them nearby will be an asset to any software development effort.

It's action from beginning to end, and it lives up to the first Blade, both movies are excellent, Wesley Snipes deleivers once again. It had me entertained and focused throughout the whole movie, never a dull moment. If your not a action flick junkee then no your probably not gonna like this flick, but if you are then you must check both Blade and Blade 2 out.
B00005JL78|5.0|I can't possibly understand how anyone **couldn't** like this movie.  It's just beautiful; the futuristic plot and special effects ought to be enough to suck you in right away.  If you like movies that involve plenty of twists and turns, this one is for you.  When I saw it last summer, I was at a loss; none of the events in the movie seemed to be helping Cruise solve his mystery.  But I should have known to just sit back and trust Steven Spielberg, because it all ties together in a haunting climax.  Anyone who doesn't love this doesn't know what they're missing.  The DVD was filled with plenty of extras, you get an entire second disk devoted to the futuristic themes of the film, as well as Steven and Tom's take on the future of pre-crime.  I bought this DVD the day it came out (December 17th, 2002), and I'm still not tired of watching it.  Get it now before you miss out on a masterpiece!
B00005JLK1|2.0|As a horror movie fan, i can spot what's gonna happen a mile away, and in this movie i knew what was gonna happen 10 min. before it was gonna happen. It's a shame too, it had a great cast of actors, too bad they were not given much to work with. I will admit though i was entertained, but in no way was i scared. What a perfect opportunity to do such a great horror film, &quot;on a ship&quot;. I also will admit, i was surprised that a certain someone/something was behind the whole thing. Anyway, as i said pretty predictable, and not scary, but if one night your bored or something, pop this in, and you'll be entertained.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Before Audioslave was realality and just a rumor that sounded like an awesome Idea, I really didn't know how it was going to turn out. I mean think of it, the former members of one of the best rap-rock bands (rage against the machine) with the front man of one of the best grunge bands (soundgarden). At first sounds like a capitol idea. Is it? Well let's get to the review. <BR>Overall, with all of this albums praise by the public and massive over play by the radio it's really noting more than an average rock album, bad? Absolutely not, but nothing really special. Of course Chris Cornell delivers top-notch vocals. But the other members, well.... at times seem to be as finely tuned. For instance, Tom Morello is one heck of a guitarist, but in a majority of the albums seems not as creative as he was in rage. The drums and bass are as well average. <BR>Some of my favorites are \\"Gasoline\\" \\"I am the highway\\" a pretty dam good ballad I must say. \\"Shadow on the sun\\" and others show extreme powerhouse tunes. <BR>So, in conclusion audioslave is an average rock album, solidly recorded and solid song structures. Just in some places the albums sounds a lot of what's drenching the music rock market today, and at this albums expense it kind of suffered
B00003CXZ1|1.0|How can anyone like this movie, especially if your a fan of the video game series. I know i am late on the review, but since the sequel is coming out this  summer, i thought i would put my two cents in. First off, i went to see this in the movie theatre, thinking this was gonna be a great, especially when i heard Angelina was playing Lara Croft, but boy was i wrong, i think everyone in the theatre dozed off, including myself. It was dark, and air conditioned in that theatre and since the movie was boring, i guess everyone thought &quot;what a great place to take a nap&quot;. There was very little action, and when there was action, you thought to yourself, who cares. A very weak plot, if i remembered what it was about, i would explain it too. I am very skeptikal about going to see this sequel to the first one, i will be very aware of what critics are saying this time around. I am not being duped again.So in one word to describe this movie &quot;BORING!&quot;

An animator's only excuse for not buying it would be bankruptcy. When it first arrived I opened it expecting a decent number of illustrations, but was overwhelmed with what I found. The wealth of knowledge he passes along not just in text but primarily in examples has never been matched. Although I've never been able to attend Mr William's animation seminars now I feel like I have. See more stunning artwork demonstrating his theories than you ever imagined. Richard Williams will have to live to be 150 to accumulate enough info to come out with a sequel to this treasure, and I hope he does for our sake.
B00006IR5S|4.0|I give the soundtrack 5 stars for the quality of the music but 3 stars for<BR>\\"originality\\" .<br />I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I bought the soundtrack to the first movie and play it quite often. The music is beautiful (John Williams is truly incredible) and evokes the magic of The Sorcerer's Stone wonderfully.<br />So, when Chamber of Secrets came out, I immediately purchased the  soundtrack. My initial response to it is that it is very much the same as the first. In fact the first track on the CD is, I believe, the same or very, very similar to the first track on Sorcerer's soundtrack.<br />I understand there is a necessary thread of continuity in the music between both movies, and, therefore, the soundtracks will sound very similar.  I just think that, as to purchasing the soundtracks, one or the other is sufficient to enhance any fan's enjoyment of the Harry Potter experience, but both are a wee bit redundant. <br />WITH THAT SAID... if you're a fan like me (read and reread all the books, watch both dvds to the point of knowing the dialogue!!!) then of course you'll want to buy this soundtrack as part of your HP collection.
0140390693|5.0|Little Women, in my opinion, is the best book ever written. It tells the story of a family living in poverty, but are much richer in love than any family I know of. There are four sisters who love each other very much, but are often quarreling as sisters do. I have read and reread this story about 25 times and every time I find it as delightful as before and I am always finding new parts that I either missed or forgotten before. I recommend this book to everyone who likes classics. Also all women who have sisters will really appreciate the trials that these four have.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Even if you hate Disney, like I do, don't make it stop you from buying this. Miyazaki smartly said Disney can't do anything to it which means they couldn't make it into junk. So in the end it's still a wonderful movie to watch over and over again.
0553296981|2.0|Forensic evidence, such as proof that large portions of this \\"diary\\" were written with a ballpoint pen, not generally available in the years in question, has cast doubt on the authenticity of this volume.  I do not purport to know if it is true or not.  It is certainly moving, as is much Holocaust literature, whether authentic or fraudulent.  What is far more disturbing is that merely questioning the authorship, or debating the numbers of persons killed in the Holocaust, has become a crime in much of the formerly \\"Free World.\\"  Another reviewer notes with evident approval that the French historian Robert Faurisson has been dismissed from his position, convicted, fined, and barred from employment for raising such questions.  This is incredible! Is it not ironic that the freedoms we supposedly fought WW II to preserve have been  erased in the name of remembering the terrors of Hitlerism?
B000089RVX|3.0|Fallen, the debut album from Evanescence, is a solid first outing for this female fronted band; all debuts should be like this for every act in my humble opinion so they're not so overhyped that it destroys them with their sophmore follow up; not so titantically fantastic that it is the only CD release that defines their entire career. Let's fact it: this is their first major release; better will come down the road for them.<br />The positives are a given once the first lyrical word is spoken: singer Amy Lee is absolutely unbelievilbly as a singer. Her range is impressive; she can hold her notes with both power and emotion, and that's pure emotion: something that is lacking in music today. The idea of a woman fronting a angry band of men on instruments is nothing new: in Europe and the underground metal scene its a driving force musically in the Opera Metal scene with acts like Therion. <br />However in this case Lee's vocals is what saves this CD. Some of the industrial-Nu Metal like sounds at times work against her and its annoying, and they should fire the producer who allowed her voice to be digitally altered for special effect purposes. A songstress of Lee's caliber, who's voice is right up there with Enya, Celine Dion, and a few well established song birds, shouldn't have anything work against her. A grand example of this is the song \\"Tourniquet\\"; there is no need to distort her voice it's ice cool delicious without the effect. The best songs on the CD are the ones with very little to no other instruments playing. The best song overall is not \\"Bring Me To Life\\", it is 'My Immortal'. That song, her voice = her proper genere style. Her voice, backed by the haunting, spiritual, angst, and sometimes evil lyrics, is what will sell this CD, and although I thought it was okay I do recommend it for the multi-musically inclined: the kind that likes all sorts of music. For pure metal fans you will not like this CD.
B00007H1Y2|3.0|After many, many listens I have warmed up to the point of trying to review this CD without bashing it completely. I say this because at first I hated it. I thought it was a ... of the \\"BVSC Aura.\\" It has grown on me to the point where I like it but will never love it and inevitably the disc will be doomed to collecting dust. To my Afro-Cuban sensitive ears this disc sounds like some type of experiment that escaped from the tiki- lounge. Sometimes it reminds me of my travels and walking into a cantina  and hearing the local talent. It sounds outright cheesy at times and for those of you old enough to remember it reminds me of background music for an old Ernie Kovacks schtick. I suppose it is innovative in sound and texture but twangy garage-style, almost Hawaiian-hula like Latin rhythmns are not  for everyone. Yes , the guitars do have a mesmerizing effect,  a palm tree in the breeze dreamy quality in Tranquility Bay but the tones emanating  are best suited for those that like music not necessarily associated with Cuban music. Ry Cooder as an innovator, a world music transglobal experimentor has reached too far this time and come up a little short. The rich guitars themselves sound good but the blend is just too odd  and doesn't excite; it is almost musical wallpaper. This mostly instrumental hybrid could have been better with more emphasis on the polyrhythmns and a little more sabor(flavor). I think you hsve to be a fan of Ry Cooder to really get into this disc; myself I preferred his collaboration work with David Lindley  and El Rayo X. If you are looking for something different, a little removed from true Cuban music but with just enough hints of it to slightly tap your feet than go for it and get this disc. Fans of Ry Cooder will probably not be dissapointed; fans of Cuban music and the BVSC will be.
0679879269|1.0|I am a high school freshman so I am thinking that my opinion probably counts.  I've read tons of books in the Fantasy area, and this has to be the worst.  I read this book about a year ago, so excuse me if I get a few details wrong.  It bothered me to see this with such a high rating.<br />I read the first two books of this series and thought they were pretty good.  I couldn't wait until this one came out.  The author's attacks on the church didn't bother me too much because I thought he was just talking about things like the horrible things the church has done in the past when they got two much power for their own good.  Human weakness sort of thing.<br />Then we get to this book.  I thought, being a christian, that the attack on god was just appalling.  I did finish the book, hoping for some worthwhile explaination, but got none.  I couldn't even find the climax of the book, the \\"big battle\\" he was suppose to be leading us to.  Then there was the sappy, sappy ending that made me want to barf.<br />I would say, especially if your a Christian, don't read this book.  Pullman had a pretty good series going and completely ruined it with this book.  Read Harry Potter or C. S. Lewis or ANYONE instead.
0375432302|5.0|Just brilliant, a very fast read. A book that after you finish it you will keep thinking about. Would make a great movie. I'm recomending it to everyone I know.
B00005AFMT|4.0|Strange...<BR>Most reviewers give Robert Fripp virtually 100% credit for the odd and interesting guitar work on this record, and when I saw this band live the summer of 1981 after the release of this album Adrian Belew did all the interesting guitar work and Robert Fripp played like a robot and rarely broke out of his mold. To be clear, Fripp is one of my favorite players but this CD is about Adrian Belew, who sings (wrote the lyrics) and plays brilliantly throughout this CD. Just as an FYI: in 1984 I saw them again after &quot;three of a perfect pair&quot; was released and Belew was amazing again and the final 30 minutes of the show Belew played drums (yes, drums) and sang while they performed some of Adrian's solo music and two Beatles songs to close the show (crazy) ... The Red-Blue-Yellow trilogy of CD's from the 80's released by King Crimson, stand perfectly on their own as 3 solid musical masterpieces, defying the rest of Art Rock. Remember some of the original members of King Crimson went on to become Asia in the 80', and what stunk worse than Asia (nothing!)  No offence to Greg Lake who I love but the 80's were a bad musical period for him and many other Art rocker bands. King Crimson shines in this period as brilliant and above (far above) the rest.
B00008S2VG|5.0|With American Life\\" Madonna shows us again how creatively people can/could be (and that the American Hair-Dyeing industry should be supported).<BR>There aren't many albums where every song is worth to listen to, but \\"American Life\\" is one of the few. That's one of the reasons why it debuted at number one, and Madonna wouldn't be satisfied with another place. The only \\"negative\\" thing about the album is that there are only 11 Tracks on it, and she has surely recorded 20 to 30 tracks, but well.<br />All in all \\"American Life\\" is a very slow, smooth and melancholic album, but this isn't negative at all. Only the opener \\"American Life\\", the second single \\"Hollywood\\", the bitter-sweet \\"Mother And Father\\" and the James Bond Theme \\"Die Another Day\\" are really Up-Tempo Songs. All the other tracks are joined by guitars (normal ones and electric ones) and cool, but slow, Beats. The best songs on the album are \\"Hollywood\\", joined by cool Electronic-Beats, \\"Intervention\\", which has a good Guitar-Intro and \\"X-Static Process\\", a \\"religious\\" ballad with the clearest voice we have ever heard of Madonna, but somehow the title reminds me of a NASA-Project. But all the other tracks are also good and have a very interesting (in a good meaning) sound. <BR>I totally recommend this album to everyone, so go and buy it!
B00004TKAQ|5.0|I remember perfectly my evenings with my friends listening to this specific album. The first time I listened to it I got astonished, that sound belonged to another realm. It was in 1983 approximately, a rather crazy period of my life. <br />Now I find that this album, which I kept scrupulously in tape is reissued in CD format. No doubt about the purchase. The quality of remastering is excellent. <br />How imaginative this music is. <br />Who do you love? Quicksilver Messenger Service, of course. <br />Get it and you'll never regret. <br />Bye
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's latest CD is not an easy thing to put your arms around upon the first listen.  It takes quite a few listens before you begin to realize that this is a beautiful CD.  <br />&quot;Ray Of Light&quot; remains my All-Time Fav by Madonna but this CD is better than &quot;Music&quot;.<br />Aside from the abysmal title track (what were you thinking Madge -- and why did you release this is as the first single???) and the odd &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot;, every song is great.<br />&quot;Easy Ride&quot; is one of the most beautiful/powerful songs Madonna has ever made.  &quot;X-Static Process&quot; is breathtaking and her vocals sound so intimate and vulnerable that it's quite touching.<br />There are a few club blazers here (including one of the most out and out scream along Pop songs she's done .. &quot;Mother and Father&quot;), but, mostly this is a mellower Madonna.<br />My personal favorites from this CD include: &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;Mother &amp; Father&quot;, &quot;X-Static Process&quot;, &quot;Easy Ride&quot;.
B000007T2Z|5.0|I got a copy of this album for my birthday some years ago, when I hadn't heard of them before. We played the cd on the party and everyone immediately loved it. Not really party music, but very moody, even for a birthday. (One of my nieces really disliked it, but then again, she only listens to classical music.)<br />So this was basically my introduction to GYBE, and what an introduction it was! Through them, I found Mogwai and Arab Strap; thank you! I still think they (GYBE) are the best in their field, really. Really dark, moody, melancholic (to the max) and dramatic music that sucks you in, totally immerses you.<br />Yes, I really love them. Their new albums (Slow Riot [...], Lift Yer Skinny Fists [...] and Yanqui U.X.O.) are great too, but this one is still my favourite. I really like the ultradrama in the first track; really moving if you're in the right mood.<br />And, like someone else stated before me, their gigs really are great. Really loud (though not as loud as Mogwai's, whose are way above what's healthy, imho), but also extremely good. The videos match their music really well. (And more than four guitars on stage is always a good thing... :-)<br />Classic. Definitely!
B000000HTM|5.0|I am afraid I too have been pulled into the spell. This is simply an amazing album. Dark and haunting, yet hopeful. The music can be terribly jarring in places, and absolutely beautiful in others. And it all hangs together very well as a whole. An incredible piece of work, by an incredible group of musicians. One of my favorite discs in my collection.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I have been playing this cd over and over in my car ever since I bought it, and am still not tired of hearing it.  Love it.
B000002JEV|4.0|Led Zeppelin's &quot;BBC Sessions&quot; captures much of the group's energy from their early period, before they became heavy metal gods. The music is raw and there is a lot of cool improvisation, plus some fun surprises with familiar tunes.<br />Disc One features a number of duplicated radio performances, and one might question the inclusion of three versions of &quot;Communication Breakdown.&quot; Each performance, however, is different, and one gets a feel of the linkage between the players in this band. Despite the different personalities, these guys played loosely as a tight unit.<br />Other multiple appearances are made by &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot; and &quot;You Shook Me&quot; and these have unique shades of differences as well, and great unison performance by Jimmy Page on guitar and Robert Plant on vocals.<br />The rarities on this disk include &quot;The Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair,&quot; &quot;Somethin' Else&quot; and the great slide blues jam of &quot;Travelling Riverside Blues.&quot;<br />Disk Two features an 'in concert' performance. &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; is tight with great stop/start dynamics. &quot;Black Dog&quot; features a taste of the opening lick to &quot;Out on the Tiles.&quot; &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; clocks in at 18:36(!) but there's some fantastic jamming here by Page. The &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; medley also features snippets of some tasty blues.<br />The liner notes give interesting details on each performance.<br />This set is a worthy addition to a music collection.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is a great CD to listen to in the car, all the songs are fast and have great beats. In that way, it's not a very diverse album, but all the songs are great anyway.  Last Nite is the best song on the CD.  It's a retro/alternative album that reminds me of the Ramones.  If you like The Vines, or the Hives, the Strokes are even better.
B000002JSR|3.0|Unlike some bands with miles and miles of studio tape containing outtakes and alternate versions of all levels of quality, Led Zeppelin left few recordings in the vault.<br />While Coda lacks the quality of Led Zeppelin's regular issues, there are a few nuggets here. \\"Darlene\\" was a minor radio hit back in 1982, when this was released. \\"Poor Tom\\" has some cool lead drumming from John Bonham and \\"Bonzo's Montreaux\\" makes a nice companion piece with \\"Moby Dick.\\" Jimmy Page's affection for Bonham is apparent in the combination of those two drum songs on the 4-disk box set from 1990.<br />\\"Ozone Baby\\" is okay musically, but has one of the most irritating vocal performances from Robert Plant ever.<br />This one is for collectors and completists, and those who just can't get enough of Led Zeppelin. Otherwise, stick with the regular issues.
B000089RVX|5.0|Fallen keep it up !  Righteous effort !  Without words one could not tell if a song was Christian or not, and that is good. For it is the lyrics from the heart of the artist that define a musical genre, not a label company or even an industry that wants to determine ratings of Christian or secular artists. Fallen is being salt and light, and the fans respond regardless of a label as Christian or secular. Who cares? I hates labels anyway, on people or music for that matter. It is a good collection of art, and I like it.  I applaud the artist for doing whatever it takes to carry the message.  Thanks Evanescence ! Is 43:19
B000083E79|5.0|CHER IS SENSATIONAL!I love all the songs on this cd all CHERS CLASSICS.MAKE SURE TO BUY THIS.Also dont miss CHERs FAREWELL TOUR<BR>The show is a blast.Also make sure to buy BROADWAY MY WAY by<BR>LINDA EDER on cd.LINDA EDER is another incredible singer.BETTER<BR>THAN BRITNEY,CHRISTINA and all teen divas who have NO TALENT.<BR>CHER AND LINDA EDER are the cds for you.
B000068MKZ|5.0|She has an absolutely enchanting voice and it works perfectly over the minimal guitar backing. It's a beautiful CD.
B000000H48|4.0|Conspiracy is actually a sequel to Them. The story continues; King is released from the asylum and returns to the old house...<BR>The music is, almost, as good as on Them, but not quite as thrilling, I think.<BR>The thing that might scare people away from buying this album is the cover. The cover does indeed show a very 80ish picture of King Diamond. Don't let that scare you away though, both the music and the storyline are still good. <BR>I would rate this album 4.5 stars, It is good, but I do think it lacks when compared to Them. Although it is very good for a sequel. It does not sound \\"old\\" or \\"bored\\". If you liked Them and Abigail, chances are that you'll like Conspiracy as well.
B00008AY3L|1.0|I turned on my radio...<BR>I heard a song called 'with my own two hands'...<BR>I turned my radio off...<BR>I went back to sleep.
B000002H33|5.0|in order to appreciate albums like this, one must pick up a guitar or a bass, try playing the leads, or the bass solos. Purly amazing, influenced my guitar playing!
1565847032|1.0|A great book!--however Noamie somehow forgets to mention that he is a Stalinist and an eternal apologist for the real forces of injustice and repression in this world.<br />Never one to be influenced by the facts of whatever issue he is writing about, Noamie will twist all logic and reason until it fits the Party line. God help the mental midgets who find this book anything but laughable.
B000002H2H|5.0|I remember the days of listening to this, was actually the first I heard of them. I thought it was the evilest, meanest sounding thing I ever heard. I showed it to my mom, she said \\"it sounds like acid music\\" *LOL how wrong she was! Its technical, loud, and has some of the best musicianship of any rock album
B00003CXTF|1.0|This movie should never have been made. It is an absolute travesty, and a slap across the face to every American who lived through the attack on Pearl Harbor. What makes it worse is knowing that the Pearl Harbor Historical Society (or Memorial, I'm not sure which it is) pointed out all the inaccuracies before the movie was completed (which were many and, in some instances, quite significant), and those responsible for making the movie refused to make a single change.<br />Good old Hollywood - never let the truth get in the way of making a buck.
B000000H5J|5.0|this is above all else, their best album, and the one that got me into them. Perfectly blend hardcore heavy metal, keyboards and tiny tiny bits of death metal (but they are far from a death band) Just a punch in the face! that all I can say
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is my absolute favorite movie. Nicole Kidman is positively radiant as the beautiful courtesan Satine (she should have won the Oscar last year!), and Ewan McGregor is wonderful as the sweet and handsome writer, Christian. The supporting cast is wonderful. I especially loved John Leguizamo as the real-life artist Toulouse Latreuc. <BR>There isn't enough space for me to express how much I love this movie. The romance gives you butterflies, the visuals take your breath away, the costumes are awesome, the music gives you chills...<br />I actually found out what happened in the end before I saw the movie which really made me mad, so I don't want to give anything away. Just see it. Please.<BR>As much as I love and as much as I HOPE you love it, Moulin Rouge is the kind of movie a person either absolutely loves or absolutely hates. Some people think musicals [stink]. Some people might be taken aback by the film's style. Just watch it with an open mind, and enjoy. I think you'll love it.
B000002H6C|5.0|never get sick of this album, and it far burries their others. However if I had to pick others, master of puppets and ride the lightning!
B00008O0WN|5.0|I loved it - despite the ending and the possible end to the TNG movies - I liked it............better than some of the other movies not as good as others but all in all a good one.  Thought the action and ships were great......
B000002HJR|5.0|This reeks of Sabbath, doesnt sound like ozzy, but what I mean is it is very heavy, grundgy, and the songs are very catchy. Album is pretty heavy straight through, except jail, which is the slowest song, however it is very haunting. Love this album. used to drink to this :)
B00003CWL6|5.0|I think this is one of the most life-affirming movies I have ever seen. Wonderful message that beauty is all around us even when we are in despair, and that beauty can help us find our way.<br />Others have raved about the performances of everyone in this movie. Phenomenal ensemble cast. I'll just add that the pivotal scene between Kevin Spacey and Chris Cooper should be shown in all classes on acting technique as an example of mastery of the craft.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This is my 2nd review just in case you didn't see the first one. <BR>THIS ALBUM ROCKS!<BR>The addition of tribal drums was an excellent choice..the sound takes me away to another place. The band stayed hard and mesmerizing. The lyrics are real and real excellent!<BR>Must buy!
0441009425|3.0|I'm a long time SF reader and am always on the look out for great new books. I stumbled across this one and it looked promising. I REALLY wanted to like it. Alastair Reynolds has put a lot of thought into this far-flung future universe, and he has come up with some stunning technical ideas. The plot is fantastic and the ending is great! However, the reader has to wade through hundreds of pages to find these great ideas and ultimately come to fantastical conclusion. I'm not sure why SF writers these days need to have SO MUCH exposition in their books and churn out mini-episodes that do nothing to further the plot (are you reading this Tad Williams?). Reynolds just needs a good, strong editor. This book could have been GREAT had it been reduced to, say, 300 pages rather than the almost 600. <br />Reynolds tries to keep us in suspense by delaying answers to puzzling riddles foisted onto the characters. But it doesn't work! I easily figured out the mysteries LONG BEFORE the characters do. And when the characters finally figure the mysteries out, or the writer, who artificially created suspense by delaying the explanation to the reader, finally gives us the explanation - IT IS NO LONGER SUSPENSFUL. I just sighed and thought FINALLY we've got that behind us. It is my opinion that Reynolds could have upped the suspense by delivering the punch lines FASTER. <br />Crispness is what is needed here. The book starts out this way and it finishes this way. In between, however, it is like quicksand as the characters slog their way through the plot.<br />And speaking of the characters, they are fairly interesting but a bit wooden. There is a major streak of droll cynicism running through everyone's personality and nothing seems to phase them much. They're still wisecracking and fairly unmoved even when faced with imminent death and/or when mysteries of the universe are unfolding before their eyes. I guess, thousands of years from now, everyone will be like this.<br />But let me saythat in the end, I liked the book. The final 50 or so pages really make up for the tiresome middle. I recommend it if you are a fast reader and are very patient.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Don't always believe what you hear! I kept hearing that this album wasn't going to be as hard and mean as Godsmack's previous albums..ha..ha...ha...<BR>THIS ALBUM ROCKS! Sully stayed hard and the music stayed mesmerizing.  The tribal sounds are an excellent addition! It brings me back to the way I felt when I first heard Voodoo. This is the kind of CD you need to take you out of reality for a while. Good CD to bring to work!
0345347951|3.0|I must admit to being slightly disappointed with CHILDHOOD'S END. It's not a bad book by any means; Clarke's imagination is at the forefront. The storyline is full of surprises, and while the characterizations are fairly shallow, that didn't adversely affect the overall book for me. Still, I couldn't help but feel that it wasn't quite as good as its hype would have one believe. It's a decent and engrossing novel, but I just didn't find it to be anything special.<br />There were parts of CHILDHOOD'S END that I just found to be too unbelievable. Now, I'm not talking about unrealistic science or an inability on my part to acknowledge the existence of aliens; I read quite a lot of science fiction, and these sorts of things I am more than willing to accept in fiction. No, to demonstrate what I found strange, I'll go through the back-cover blurb. It begins: \\"The Overlords appeared suddenly over every city - intellectually, technologically, and militarily superior to humankind.\\" So far, so good. It continues: \\"Benevolent, they made few demands: unify earth, eliminate poverty, and end war.\\" Again, nothing too shocking. Friendly aliens aren't going to make me throw down the book in disbelief. But the following bit I found to be a bit much: \\"With little rebellion, mankind agreed, and a golden age began.\\" Now personally I just can't see that happening as peacefully and simply as Clarke posits. And the book doesn't give us much more background that that short sentence. Clarke just skips right over parts like this that would be difficult to swallow. <br />I think part of my difficulty accepting large chunks of the exposition was the way in which Clarke chooses to deliver his narrative. The book skips and jumps through the decades, but also tries to keep itself grounded by introducing us to a variety of easily-exchangeable characters. Clarke is trying to do two things at once here, and in a book that's a slim 212 pages, he simply doesn't give himself enough room to do justice toboth. He wants to give us a grand sweeping vision of the future, where the stories of individuals are washed away in the march of time. But then he'll suddenly jump back and relate a chapter or two focusing on a handful of characters. Then it'll be back to the grand historical approach, leaving those individuals far behind. I think that Clarke could have pulled off this approach if he had an extra hundred pages to play around with. Unfortunately, he didn't, and the book ends up being at times neither one thing nor the other.<br />It sounds as if I'm being a bit too hard on this book, and I've devoted more time that I meant to on highlighting the negative points. But I did find a lot to enjoy here. Clarke writes a plot that I simply couldn't anticipate; many of the surprises caught me off-guard. Clarke is thinking big here. He's looking at mankind's place in a large universe and comparing our progress to what limitless potential there is out there. I really appreciated the scope of his vision.<br />It just seemed to me as if Clarke was trying to cram too much into the short amount of pages allotted. It forces him to keep rushing forward, not giving himself time to dwell on some of the ideas that he confronts us with. It also forces him to provide exposition by dumping huge blocks of narration at us, or simply by having characters give long speeches at each other. CHILDHOOD'S END is full of thought-provoking ideas, and I'd classify it as a good science-fiction novel, but I cannot honestly say that I found it a great one.
0553382179|3.0|After becoming familiar with the...user group, I looked forward to reading Marla Cilley's book.  However, I was disappointed to find that much of the book content was on the website or contained in the user group reminders.  On a positive note, Cilley's cleaning \\"style\\" is refreshing, unpretentious, and worthwhile.  I use some of her suggestions daily.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Madonna is an amazing pop musician, not because she has remained popular for twenty years while other pop divas (Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston) have sunk, but because her music demonstrates true evolution.  It changes and grows with the passage of time and with her maturity as an artist and person.  &quot;American Life&quot; is the natural step to follow &quot;Music,&quot; her last LP, which was also produced by Mirwais.  While other artists merely sing the same kinds of songs written by the same group of songwriters, Madonna gives herself to the creative process, always co-writing her songs in a truly collaborative process.<br />Here, Madonna has incorporated more guitar and pulled back on the electronica, resulting in a leaner, gentler sound.  She's once again pulled from her own life for material, but this time she's more critical--of her success, her desire for fame, and her convoluted relationship with love.  On &quot;Ray of Light&quot; she proclaimed that she had &quot;traded fame for love without a second thought,&quot; and the lonliness that pervaded that work has been replaced with an acceptance of love and a willingness to let herself succumb to love.  In &quot;X-Static Process&quot; a slow, lean lullaby of a song featuring only guitar and self-harmonized vocals, she says &quot;I always wished that I could find someone as beautiful as you, but in the process I forgot that I was special too.&quot;  That song, along with &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; and &quot;Intervention&quot; form the mellow, internal centerpiece of the album.  &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is a beautiful song, which builds slowly until the end when choirs burst out &quot;I'm not religious, but I feel so moved...makes me want to pray.&quot;  <br />It's not all philosophizing on the power of love though.  Title track &quot;American Life&quot; turns up the beats and bloops as Madonna asks if the &quot;modern life&quot; is really for her.  Here she's not attacking American (as her critics have implied), but rather critiqueing the extent to which she had succumbed to the darker impulses of American society--namely the drive to achieve more fame, more material things.  &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; also pulses with vocodor vocals and beats, similar to &quot;Music's&quot; &quot;Impressive Instant.&quot;  <br />The bridging theme across this introspective of fame, materialism, and love is that of identity.  Madonna is taking a look at who she is and how she's been affected by love, fame, and the American drive to achieve.  It's not clear that she has the answers yet, but at least she's asking the questions.  In the final track, she says &quot;I want the good life, but I don't want an easy ride&quot; and that she wants to &quot;live forever.&quot;  <br />Critics have said that it's a cliche for stars to bemoan stardom, but any good artist knows that the core of art should come from one's own experience.  Most of us have no idea what superstardom on Madonna's level is like and I don't think it's fair to criticize her for being honest.  I've always felt that we don't really know Madonna well through the media, since she is such a master at controlling knowledge, that one never knows what is really &quot;true&quot; when it comes to her.  But through her music, as a body of work, there is a narrative story about her life.  And it is through her music that Madonna is most enjoyed and appreciated--it has always been this way.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I almost didn't buy this because of all the negative reviews... but since I have every other Madonna CD I had to get it.  I'm glad I did because I also think this is one of her better CD's and I have enjoyed it immensely already.
B00008WT5J|5.0|AC/DC's 1986 release entitled \\"Who Made Who\\" is actually the music from the soundtrack \\"Maximim Overdrive\\" written by Stephen King. The entire soundtrack's music was provided by AC/DC which was ideal for this movie,which was about machines taking over, hence depicted in the song \\"Who Made Who\\". There are some excellent rocker's here pulled from the various AC/DC catalog (the several exceptions being the title song \\"Who Made Who\\", \\"D.T.\\" and \\"Chase The Ace\\" which made their debut on this album) such as \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" (from Back In Black), \\"Sink The Pink\\" and \\"Shake Your Foundations\\" (from Fly On The Wall),\\"Ride On\\" (from Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap)and \\"For Those About To Rock (We Salute You)\\" (from the album For Those About To Rock...). I purchased this cd just for the three above mentioned songs \\"Who Made Who\\", \\"D.T.\\" and \\"Chase The Ace\\", the last two are ... kicking instrumental rockers and are unique to this album (or cd in this case). Those of you who remember watching \\"Maximum Overdrive\\" will instantly have flashbacks when hearing these three songs. The song \\"Who Made Who\\" opens the movie with an awesome car collision due to a drawbridge opening on it's own as cars are lined up on top. Total chaos erupts as the bridge opens and cars crash into one another and a motorcylist and car plunge into the river below. Also, the song \\"Chase The Ace\\" is played during a a car chase scene where a Mack truck driving with no one at the wheel, continues to rear end a newlywed couple's car until the truck ends up going over an embankment and going up in flames. \\"D.T.\\" is played as a young boy rides his bike down a neighborhood street and sprinklers and a lawnmower seem to have a mind of their own and go on for no apparent reason. This newly remastered cd is ten times better than it's non-remastered version, with the volume increased, the mid-range and bottom end pumped up as well. The digipack that houses the cd is attractive and there's also afifteen page booklet enclosed that has information about the soundtrack \\"Maximum Overdrive\\", the making of \\"Who Made Who\\" and color photos of the band. This is a must have for all AC/DC lovers and fans of 80's rock. Highly Recommended!
B00008S2VG|5.0|In my opinion, it's ranked up there with Ray of light, Like A Prayer &amp; Erotica! <br />Don't be fool by the first single &quot;American Life&quot;, this album has much more to offer! Listen to tracks like &quot;Nothing fails&quot;, &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;Mother and father&quot; and you realize what an awesome album this is!
B00005JLT5|5.0|I saw The Pianist on my birthday 3 months ago.<BR>I had heard some good reviews and was very interested to see what Polanski had been up to lately.<BR>I was astonished, moved, and speechless.<BR>The movie embodies everything that I love about film....a true story being told with love and great care for the past, and in a way that makes you feel the pain that the characters experience.<br />Adrien Brody will now get the credit he deserves after his 10+ years in the industry. His performance was genuine and brilliant. He has been my favorite actor for a few years and out did all of his previous work with his role as Wladyslaw Szpilman. I cannot think of a more deserving performance of the Best Actor Oscar in recent years.<br />The Pianist is an unforgettable film about a simple man who hangs on when all hope and life is lost from the world he knows.

6304500831|5.0|The video is absolutley timeless.  Still holds up to todays music and animation even though it's over 30 years old.  I HIGHLY reccommend this one for any children under 6.  Has anyone seen the Travelin Tyke video yet??
B000002B2X|5.0|I tell you what Alice In Chains definitely grows on you. Damn fine band, and this album is no exception. I personally guarantee you wont be disappointed with this OR ANY album from Alice In Chians!! Excellent recording!
B00005JL95|2.0|I was not so impressed with this video.  Yes the animation is great, but the story line is a little dull and both of my children had a very hard time keeping their interests up ...
0316666343|2.0|This book missed the point somewhere along the way.  There was so much potential to this story.  However, it just made it to mediocre.  There is too much filler and incidental information written.  It would have been so much more exciting to be quick and to the point and to keep those characters moving in more compelling ways. It starts off just fine..and then becomes too boring.  A great disappointment.  DLD
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Hasn't everyone already seen this movie?  I was FANTASTIC in theatres and I assure you that the entire family will love this one as well.  ...
B00005OAIE|5.0|I know it might seem like the last few tracks on this are slow and not as great the first time through, but they are actually inspiring, meaningful and downright awesome.  There is honestly not a song I don't like on here and I could listen to it over and over and over again and not get sick of it.  It's good if I am sad, happy, driving, doing homework- anything!  It is just the best CD ever and one of the best you will ever spend your money on.  His music style and songs rock!  IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY- YOU'LL LOVE IT!

B00006690G|2.0|I'm sorry but this cd isn't good. It not bat or some thang but eminem ain't commin hard, know I mean. On the The Marshall Mathers LP  he came raw, with songs like B Please II, Remember me and so on. So ya'll betta gon' cop cd's of Tha DPGC'z (Snoop Kurupt, daz) and of dr. Dre (NWA) that's all better. There 's only 1 real good song on this album: 'Till I Collapse . O yeah: Dre is also commin weak on this cd.<br />Peace!
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Yeah, there's good stuff here.  I'm sure the hardest thing to do was whittle the tracks down to this few.  I didn't buy it (gasp!) because with the exception of \\"True Colors\\", all of these songs were on previous CDs...and with the advent of CD burners, you could easily make your own.<br />The discussions of what the track listing 'should have been', just like talking about what songs MIGHT be played IF there was a Genesis reunion crack me up.  <br />But rest assured, there WILL be a Phil Collins box set in the near future.  Now that will be worth owning!
B00003CXSM|5.0|Fantastic romantic comedy DVD, great for that &quot;date night&quot;. Lopez is funny, the script is good and overall the film puts you in a very romantic mood. DVD is in good quality and plays well. Special features are ok too, some deleted scenes.
B00004T9UH|1.0|All there is is pointless cussing.....
B00000JMQE|4.0|One of the big trends of the 80's was the seemingly endless trend of half-baked sequels, remakes and other assorted attempts to \\"improve\\" what was already recognized as perfect (remember the new coke?). Perhaps that was why so many people dismissed Disney's sequel to the 1939 film. \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" It is a shame that \\"Return to Oz\\" did not get the exposure it was due, because it is a great movie.<br />Fairuza Balk was exceptional as Dorothy. She was the right age for the character (Judy Garland, talented as she was, was considerably older than the Dorothy of the books). More importantly though, she was everything a child star should be. Her Drorthy was brave, compassionate and enjoyable, without a trace of the cloying \\"cutsieness\\" or smart aleckiness many child actors demonstrate. The supporting characters, particularly Brian Henson's Jack Pumpkinhead, were not only excellent, but very true to the original books. The special effects that went into bringing them to life hold up very well today, excpet for Billina, the yellow hen, who is obviously mechanical. Her wit and pluck make her a very enjoyable character anyway though.<br />Some have said that this movie is too scary for kids, which really makes no sense. The scary parts of the movie; the wheelers, the gnome king, the deadly desert that turns people to sand, the witch Mombi, the princess who changes her head to suit her whims and threatens to take Dorothy's, all of these were created by L. Frank Baum, the creator of the Oz series. They have lived in his books for almost 100 years, and will probably outlive us all. When did these elements suddenly become \\"too scary\\" for children?<br />My complaints about the movie are few. For one thing, when Dorothy arrives in Oz she passes by her old house and then, in the next scene, arrvies at the Emerald City. Later she looks out from one of the city's towers and sees the desert surrounding Oz. This gives the impression that Oz is about four square miles. Second, Dorothy notes that the deadly desert will turn anyone who touches it into sand. When did she learn this? Because reference is made to the ruby slippers, we can assume this is a sequal to the 1939 movie and not the book (which featured silver shoes), but when was this fact revealed in the movie? This latter detail is a bit of a nit pick I admit.<br />Overall there is much to recommend in \\"Return to Oz.\\" Do not watch it expecting to relive the 1939 picture. Instead, try to appreciate it for its own merits.
B00006CXXU|5.0|WOW!  Christina Aguilera went from <BR>-Christina Aguilera<BR>-Mi Reflejo<BR>-My Kind Of Christmas<BR>-Just Be Free<BR>and finally... \\"Stripped\\"!  Wow! Every song on the cd is great!<BR>For all the people who gave the cd 1's need to get it together.  I realize that most of the low ratings were because of her new LOOKS but I believe that we are reviewing the songs and not the videos.  The other big thing is that most of the 1's say that the songs have no meaning or importance.  If you feel that way you should re-listen to the cd, especially #14 Soar.  But enough about that... the cd is full of great vocals, songs, and plenty of good beats that just make you want to dance!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|One of the most aggressive bands to bring it from the NorthEast. Faceless, their follow up to the amazingly successful &quot;AWAKE&quot; release, is every bit as heavy and aggressive as we have come to expect from Godsmack. The first 2 songs on the Faceless CD: &quot;Straight out of Line&quot; and &quot;Faceless&quot; just rip! The kind of ferocity that gets your blood pumping. The rest of the CD rocks too... Godsmack is not a one-hit wonder band... they keep it coming hard and heavy throughout the whole CD. Serenity is a tune similar to \\"Voodoo\\" from their first release. This song is every bit as mysterious as Voodoo, yet has its own feel that Godsmack fans have grown to appreciate. Godsmack should not go \\"Faceless\\" any longer... for the people who have not associated Godsmack as a definitive Hard-Rock presence in the music industry surely will after this latest release. This CD is the best CD I have bought in a long time... I can listen to it repeatedly without feeling that the music gets played out too soon. Heavy Riffs that make you want to grab a guitar and rip it up, Aggressive Lyrics that make you glad you kicked that lyin' chick to the curb, and the methodical drumlins that make your head twitch forward and back repeatedly.<BR>A must buy CD for sure! You won't be disappointed... Godsmack delivers the heavy fix!
0684833395|5.0|In modern day, relatively few people read books which are written by contemporary authors, never mind authors from fifty years ago , but some books just stand out even to people who only have a minor knowledge of classic American literature.  Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is one such novel.  Set toward the end of World War II, the book follows a very vague plot line with a strange way of representing time but uses abundant, rich, and sometimes a little dark humor to weave an enthralling tale about the bombardier Yossarian and his struggle against reality, particularly the fact that he has to fly in a plane (with people whom he has never even met before shooting at him) just because he is told to.  <BR> The book is well written and it draws you (the reader) in by really relating you to the myriad characters and their unique quirks.  There is little historical accuracy in this book and some things are so wrong that its downright funny, for example Milo Minderbinder's mess hall syndicate (M&M) which, run by a lowly mess officer, trades with countries and organizations all over the world (including Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia) turning a prophet using confusing tangles of twisted logic and the magic slogan \\"everyone has a share.\\"  The humor is by far the book's most prominent strength but the writing is a close second.  The astoundingly detailed and descriptive prose makes the funny parts all the more zany and the heavy, semi-depressing parts so vivid and powerful that they are extremely moving at times.  This combined with Heller's sharp wit and snappy 50's slang make this book an immensely entertaining read and certainly an example of a great American novel of merit.
B00005B36H|5.0|For anybody who understands what a Saturn Return is, and can identify with it in their own life, I highly recommend you LISTEN to this album.  TOOL transcends the business of making music with Lateralus, an album that is spiritually defining and deeply meaningful.  <br />Sure, anyone can be amused by the catchy tunes, and let Lateralus remain for what it is on the surface: a great rock album.  But for those that are undergoing spiritual molting, Lateralus is significant beyond words.  Delve into TOOL's vivid portrayals of the universal conflicts that affect us all (consciously or subconciously), and come away a different person entirely.  Now, whether one changes for the worse or better, is up to the invidual.  Choose I or X.<br />I'm still prying open my third eye.
B00000I07R|5.0|This album is a great follow up to New Jersey! Songs like Bed of roses,In these arms,and Sleep when i'm dead are outstanding!This album may not be as big as Slippery or New Jersey,but this is still an Exellent album!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Nature Boy - The beginning music. \\"A very strange and enchanted boy...\\" This one is okay. It's good, but not something to sing along with or anything. But it's still good. 3/5<br />Lady Marmalade - In my opinion, this is the worst song on the soundtrack. It's not THAT bad, but it just doesn't really match up with the rest of the soundtrack. It's below average I'd say. 2/5<br />Because We Can - I don't really like this one either. It's pretty cool at first, but the repitition of \\"Yeah yeah yeah!\\" gets annoying after a while. Good song for tehno-ish dancing, but simply not my style. 2/5<br />Sparkling Diamonds - This song is good. Very energetic and definitely fun to sing along with. \\"Diamonds are a girl's best friend...\\" 4/5<br />Rhythm of the Night - The lyrics were changed a bit to fit the Moulin Rouge theme, but otherwise, it's a nice little song. I don't think this one was in the movie. 4/5<br />Your Song - A great song by Ewan McGregor. One of my favorites. 5/5<br />Children of the Revolution - This is a good song. It's very Rock-ish and catchy. I don't think it was featured in the movie either. 4/5<br />One Day I'll Fly Away - A nice and famous piece by Satine or Nicole Kidman. Also one of my favorites. 4/5<br />Diamond Dogs - A strange little piece that wasn't featured in the movie. I don't really care too much for this one. It's too techy for the soundtrack. But it's nice to listen to once in a while, since it's so different. 2/5<br />Elephant Love Medley - A cute little conversation/song with Satine (Nicole Kidman) and Christian (Ewan McGregor). One of my favorites and a pleasure to sing along with. 4/5<br />Come What Way - Another Satine and Christian duet. Great to sing along with and one of my favorite songs. Definitely worth listening to. 5/5<br />El Tango De Roxanne - My friends dubbed this song as 'scary.' But I disagree. The scene it gets paired up with in the movie is a bit startling, but the song itself is powerful and unique. Yes, you guessed it, also one of my favorties. 5/5<br />Complainte De La Butte - As far as my memory goes, this song was not in the movie. In my opinion, I think it's very under rated. But I guess you have to be a fan of this type of style to enjoy it, which I believe, is more 'real bohemian.' Oh, and by the way, it's in a different language. Still worth listening to though. 5/5<br />Hindi Sad Diamonds - The end performance sung partially by Satine/Nicole Kidman. A tempting, energy-filled, totally different remix of Sparkling Diamonds. The beginning is in a different language. But yes, I like this one too. 4/5<br />Nature Boy - The end. A very similar song to the first one. Same comments as Nature Boy #1 \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.\\" 3/5<br />Overall: About 4/5<br />Don't let that, reason you out of buying this soundtrack. We all are different and obviously have different tastes, so you might end up REALLY liking this soundtrack. <br />Well, hope my review helped!
0345457684|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. In the best tradition of science fiction Richard Morgan has come up with an idea that once you read it you wonder why you never thought of the concept -- very believable, extremely well-written, gripping. (For the faint of heart like me -- I suggest you skip the torture scenes.)  I can't imagine anyone not loving this book!
B00005B36H|5.0|I believe that Tool moved farther from there lyrical aspect and deeper into the instrumental. Me being a fan of instrumental bands (Planet-X, Liquid Tension Experiment) I liked this album the most.<BR>Some people cant appriciate the complexicity of this music so they dont understand this and so they will never experience the joy of truely awesome music.
0792844882|4.0|Showgirls is by far one of the best films of the 90's. Most people think it is a soft-core porn, and in some ways it is (there is one sex scene, which takes place in the pool), but there is so much more to the movie. It is really a kind of documentary. Showgirls takes a behind the scenes look at the glamour and corrupt/disturbing world of Las Vegas showgirls. Sabotage is frequent as is drug use and deceit. Elizabeth Berkley does a good job playing the part although the former Saved by the Bell-er can be somewhat melodramatic at times. Overall Showgirls is an incredible movie, a movie that everybody should see at least once.       Now for the extra features--there is the standard theatrical trailer as well as a short documenraty, talking with the stars type thing. The documentary is very short and it is dissapointing that there are not more extra features for such a controversial movie. WARNING!!!As this movie is NC-17, it is not suitable for young children. There is of course nudity, bad language, quite a bit of drug use, adult situations and sex. There is also a very disturbing rape scene, which is the main reason for not allowing children under the age of 15 or 16 to view this movie.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Ok, I've watched it. The movie release date here in Brazil was April 30th, and as a long time fan of the Children of the Atom, I was in the front row of the very first screening. I liked X-Men: The Movie, of course it lacked some action, but it was all forgiven because not only it had to estabilish the scenario and present the characters, wich took a good hour and a half off the movie, but also the budget with wich Bryan Singer worked was very thin. Now, with the introductions out of the way, and with MUCH more money in hands, I tought Singer could finally give his vision of the Mutants wings.<BR>And he did.<BR>And oh, we are SO not ready!<BR>Not only this movie rocks the previous one, it has excelled in most every aspect. Characterizations are simply perfect, There is at least 500% more plot going on, it's darker, it's more violent, it's more thrilling, and it builds up all the way to a spetacular ending that will leave you [begging] for the third one.<BR>Not all of the characters being announced play a major part. The new characters with the most screen time are Nightcrawler, Stryker and Yuriko. There's much more screen time for Pyro and Iceman, also. As for the others, they are more like cameos, but will nonethless make all fans jump and cheer on their seats. The acting is superb, even those who didn't quite make into their characters on the first movie redeem themselves in this sequel, the most notable case being Halle Berry. Her Storm is much more profound, and it uses much more of her powers throughout the flick. Hugh Jackman manages to be an even better Wolverine than the first movie one, and he makes the whole audience gasp in one of the best scenes in the movie, when he goes berserker and shows some spec ops what a badass he can be when he's [mad]! Magneto and Charlie are superb, and Nightcrawler is absolutely amazing. And man, I could go on and on about how this movie ROCKS, but I'm pretty sure everyone will agree with me after the movie ends.<BR>In short,this is the best superhero movie EVER made, and one of the few that are not directed toward teenagers. This movie is comic book fantasy with a very serious treatment, and any fan like me knows that the Uncanny X-Men more than deserve it.<BR>I can hardly wait for X3!!
0790729369|5.0|I CAN RELATE TO THE LIVE FOR THE MOMENT, THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE!!<br />A PERFECT CAST.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|From what sounds like a scratchy broadcast of a sermon about the Apocalypse from the book of Revelation, to covers of grunge rock and cowboy ballads, to a duet with Nick Cave (!) of a Hank Williams classic, Cash's fourth collaboration with Rick Rubin is  the most daring,and my favorite.  I get chills up my spine when I hear \\"The Man Comes Around\\", a Cash composition that foretells Jesus' return. The instrumentation....guitar and piano, primarily...is flawless.  At first some of the backups by Fiona Apple and June Carter seemed annoying; but the more I listened, the more the harmonies recalled Appalachian melodies that are more beautiful because of their simplicity.  Cash himself, however, hits each note just right.<br />Besides \\"The Man\\", the highlights include \\"Hurt\\", not just because it's a coup for Johnny Cash to record a 9 Inch Nails song but because the combination of the heartbreaking lyrics and Cash's weathered voice is perfect; \\"Give My Love to Rose\\", a very Cash-like ballad including all the typical Cash elements (prison, death, love); the aforementioned duet with Mr. Cave (who, by the way, Cash covers wonderfully with a version of \\"Mercy Seat\\" on American III, which is also worth buying); and Cash turning Depeche Mode's irreverence on its head by turning the \\"reach out & touch me\\" line in \\"Personal Jesus\\" into \\"reach out and touch faith\\", thereby turning it into a gospel song.<br />I grew up with Johnny Cash (which means when I wanted to listen to rock, dad made us listen to country) and have grown from tolerating him to remembering him as a cherished part of my childhood.  It's cool to realize that he's being played on the alternative stations that I would have listened to anyway...even if I hadn't decided that dad's music wasn't so bad, after all.
B000002ADT|5.0|If the fact that you are looking at this page means you do not yet own this recording, then do yourself a favor and get it, whoever you are. If you are a jazz fan and you somehow do not yet own Kind of Blue, get it. If you are not a jazz fan but are curious about the genre, get it. And even if you have never been interested in jazz, get it.<br />This may not be the best jazz album ever, but it is easily the most accessible of any that can lay claim to that honor. I don't know anyone who knows Kind of Blue and doesn't like it.<br />The album is the jazz equivalent of St. Pepper's or Beethoven's Fifth -- a recording that those who aren't enamored with the type of music appreciate and that true students of the genre admire. But don't take my word for it: look at Miles Davis' all-star cast that includes Bill Evans and John Coltrane, look at all the glowing reviews below from other Amazon users ... and get the CD.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Wachowski Brothers are surely brilliant. 'The Matrix' practically created the Bullet-Time genre, in which was spoofed by over 20 movies, yet this movie does it the best. The gut-pounding action is great, and the special effects are superb. The visuals are absolutely stunning. Though this is only their second directing ('Bound' being their first,) 'The Matrix' breaks so many boundaries, and is hands-down one of the greatest, no, IS the greatest Sci-Fi film of all time. I really do not see how this plot can be so 'confusing'. Begin Summary: A man, named Thomas A. Anderson leads another life as a hacker named Neo. He realizes that he has been living in an artificially created world known as 'The Matrix'. He meets the one and only Morpheus, who sends him to the real world. There, he finds out that when A.I. was invented, the machines needed solar energy to live because they were fighting with the humans, so this is how 'The Matrix' was created. Neo and other freed members must fight and destroy 'The Matrix' so the human race can be free. End Summary. Simple as that. Now if people just followed the story line and PAID ATTENTION, they would get the plot. I pretty much love this film from start to finish, and the soundtrack is great. If you're a Sci-Fi fan, make sure to pick this up on DVD with awesome features. And there's only two weeks left until 'Reloaded'...
B000002MZ9|3.0|On paper this looks like a great match up, the \\"Grandfather of Grunge\\" teaming with his disciples, Pearl Jam. The bad news is that it does not create the masterful one off project that it could of been.<br />It is hard to put a finger on why this album comes up short, but the most glaring is that the songs are not very consistant. DOWNTOWN, I'M THE OCEAN and FALLEN ANGEL are good songs, but the rest are pretty non-descript. To make matters worse, Pearl Jam tend to play at one pace throughout the album and tend to bulldoze any subtlety out of the material. Cray Horse is not as talented musically as PJ, but they know how to support the boss and bring out his best assets.<br />This is not a bad work, but I fail to see how it can get 5 stars from anyone. I don't really play this too often, but when I do I can seldom make it through the duration. This appears to have more in common with Neil's inconsistant 80's work than his more inspired 90's output.
0802130208|4.0|A satirical anecdote of the decay of lower-class New Orleans, John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces presents a 30 year old, overweight and highly educated ape of a man living at home with his poor, driven-to-drink mother.  The two make a pair of human beings (if one would consider the former a human being) operating at polar ends of the morality spectrum.  Neither understand the other, and as each day passes, the frustration and trapped feeling rises more and more in the mother of Ignatius J. Reilly: Blundering Fool.<BR>     The story begins with Ignatius and his mother running into a desperate patrolman, Mancuso, whose only aspiration in life is to bring down his first criminal.  When Mancuso targets Ignatius, all hell breaks loose and the 30 year old man becomes four, and screams for his mother's assistance.  Ignatius' outrageous attempt to remain unemployed and sunken into the depths of his bedroom with pen and notepad in hand, constantly scribbling ideas and random thoughts proves his laziness and carelessness of his mother's well being.  His mother, widowed Mrs. Reilly, is relentlessly struggling to get her inactive lump of a son out into the world to seek employment.  After a minor car accident, Mrs. Reilly finally convinces her son to get a job in order to pay for damages caused by the accident.  Levy Pants to the rescue!  Ignatius receives, to some degree, employment at an office, which manages a trouser-producing factory.

Myrna Minkoff randomly shows up at his house and takes him back to New York with her, rescuing him from the Psycho Ward before they arrive to carry him off.  <BR>     The novel is basically a cluster of characters, which are all troubled in some way.  The title is quite fitting.  I really enjoyed reading the book, because of the comedic content.  However, a plot was difficult to locate.  All of the characters wound together in a way that was quite fascinating and logical.  However, like I said, what is the point?  I can't say that I recommend this book to anyone, unless they are simply bored and are looking for an autobiography of an irrational, and sad man who has nothing to live for but himself.
0316666343|1.0|After seeing such high recommendations (and intriguing low ones), I borrowed this book from a friend. There are some lovely moments of poetic language and imagery, though others come off as forced and awkward. Many characters and situations seemed tacked on and are never fully developed. The characters, even Susie herself, failed to strike an emotional chord--that is, except for the killer. I felt the bile rise in my stomach with every mention of his name. His end left me cold and unsatisfied--I shudder to think what his heaven might be like, yet I am never told if he gets his just deserts in the afterlife. I also found myself annoyed at several errors. There were no 130 prismacolor sets in 1973! Nor are sarees worn with pants! For a truly fascinating account of a teen's journey to healing, read Laurie Halse Anderson's stunning award-winner, Speak. It will capture you to your very core.
0802130208|4.0|A satirical anecdote of the decay of lower-class New Orleans, John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces presents a 30 year old, overweight and highly educated ape of a man living at home with his poor, driven-to-drink mother.  The two make a pair of human beings (if one would consider the former a human being) operating at polar ends of the morality spectrum.  Neither understand the other, and as each day passes, the frustration and trapped feeling rises more and more in the mother of Ignatius J. Reilly: Blundering Fool.<BR>The story begins with Ignatius and his mother running into a desperate patrolman, Mancuso, whose only aspiration in life is to bring down his first criminal.  When Mancuso targets Ignatius, all hell breaks loose and the 30 year old man becomes four, and screams for his mother's assistance.  Ignatius' outrageous attempt to remain unemployed and sunken into the depths of his bedroom with pen and notepad in hand, constantly scribbling ideas and random thoughts proves his laziness and carelessness of his mother's well being.  His mother, widowed Mrs. Reilly, is relentlessly struggling to get her inactive lump of a son out into the world to seek employment.  After a minor car accident, Mrs. Reilly finally convinces her son to get a job in order to pay for damages caused by the accident.  Levy Pants to the rescue!  Ignatius receives, to some degree, employment at an office, which manages a trouser-producing factory.  After a few weeks working for the easily confusable, and deceived Mr. Gonzalez, Ignatius becomes reluctantly comfortable as a filer.

B00005OAIE|1.0|Wow,  I didn't realize anything this mediocre could get produced by a major label.  Obviously good intentions,  but there are no surprises anywhere in instrumentation, tonal changes, energy, or pace.  My strong bias is not to write negative reviews, but this sounds like music and lyrics for a very young person locked in a fetal position in their dorm bed, reminiscing about a life that has hardly begun.
B00008J2DQ|2.0|I bought the new Godsmack CD &quot;Faceless&quot; the day it came out and have yet to listen to it all the way through.  Why should I?  Halfway through it I realized that I already own a better version of it.  You might too.  It's called &quot;Awake&quot; and it was Godsmack's last CD before this one.  There's not a thing on here that I remember an hour after listening to it.  When Godsmack first came out, I loved their bare bones approach because &quot;back to basics&quot; hard rock was in the minority at that time.  Now it just seems like they're not even trying anymore.  To me it sounds like Godsmack are just riding their notoriety to the top of the charts and can't be bothered with writing catchy songs anymore.  Well being friends with the guys in Pantera will only get you so far, and after that you're on your own.  Here's to the most appropriately titled CD of the year...  &quot;Faceless&quot;.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This CD affirms my belief that Opeth are the best band in the world today. The synergy between these four musicians (+ Steven Wilson!) is pure magic. Before Opeth, I had little faith in modern rock music. Opeth has opened my eyes to some of the greatest music ever made. Before, I thought the best rock came out in the 70s. I think Opeth's sound is the next phase in the evolution of the great 70s bands. At first, I didn't like this CD as much as their heavier stuff, but with repeated listens, it is seeping into my consciousness. What I love about this music is the subtlety in textures and moods. The drumming is some of the most ingenious and precise that I've heard (at times, it reminds me of Bill Bruford's style in early Yes - Heart of the Sunrise). I could go on for days on this CD so I'll close with - BUY IT NOW! Let's get this band in the US music industry's radar so other US citizens can at least find their CD's in their local record store.
B000001EGA|5.0|All I can say is those other reviews are off base and those folks are nuts!  This is Elton's best album by far. It rocks and has the coolest quality about it.  You would have to hear it to understand. His most gorgeous and moving song he ever wrote is on this album - &quot;We all fall in love sometimes&quot;.  The music and creativity is amazing. DO YOURSELF a FAVOR and get this now!  One of my favorite albums ever recorded!!
B000003S0P|5.0|If you're new to Crimson, then let me say that Red is the best album to acquaint yourself with in regards to this recklessly endearing band. Unlike many of the other later albums produced by KC, Red adopts a powerful yet simpler sound with rockin' guitar riffs, pulsing percussion, and time signatures that aren't quite as complex as some of their other efforts (not to say that there isn't a good deal of abstractness in certain areas of this album, because there is).<br />This album is the last effort of the triumverate power core epoch (as I like to call it) of Crimson history, featuring Wetton on Bass and vocals, Bruford on drums (argueably the best KC drummer ever) and, of course, Mr. Fripp on guitar. This album grabs you by the throat at the getgo and doesn't really let up until the melancholy and turbulent \\"Starless\\" finale', the last track hailing from this legendary lineup of musicians. The opening title track gets straight to the point, opening with a wailing guitar solo backed by a powerful bass and percussion progression, along with your typical KC time signature and tempo changes throughout the song.<br />I'm not a music major and I'm not as devout a listener to Crimson as many are. Hell, I'm not even as old as this album is. Still, I can tell you that Red is a timeless little kicker of a gem that belongs in the library of any prog rock connessuier.  Bands like KC are the ancestors of many of the most important rock and metal bands of today, and it's definetely enjoyable and worthwhile to experience the raw and original creativity and musicianship that started the evolution to where we are today.
B00004XOWM|1.0|The old limp bizkit stuff is O.K. but this is just pathetic. No Musicianship, the rap has almost completely taken over, the profanity seems the only reason teenagers are still buying this. Fred Durst is not a good singer at all, why did he try to sing so much more on this album? He is at his best with his yells, in songs like Break Stuff. The Mission Impossible Cover was decent in the musical aspect, but I have grown to hate Fred Durst's vocals and this is no better. Why do they get paid to make this? Oh great he says the F word 50 some times in one song, that requires musical talent and deserves to make limp bizkit rich, well that is a bunch of *. Other then the profanity, fred keeps going on about is how ben stiller is his best friend, although the outro is amusing in a sense. This is an album with some high points, but they highs are not that great, and they are not many. I think a guitar solo or some heavy riffs or something would have been well appreciated to fans into it for the rock/metal side of it. Limp Bizkit was never THAT great, but like i said at first, this is pathetic. I havent listened to this is a LONG time, and I am ashamed to even have this album.-----I now listen to more heavy/death metal bands, and i cant believe limp bizkit sells more records than meshuggah.
B00000AFGM|5.0|this album is manson worst album , but still it has some of his best songs , and so of the most  amazing rock/hard rock songs ever. the king of the shock rock tried the glam rick system and it is work suprisely parfactly!<BR>coma white , the speed of pain , fundmentally lohtsome , great big white world and of curse , dissosative , are an amazing songs<BR>i didnt like the comarceil &quot;the dope show&quot; to much aprtizing<BR>this afine work , but not his best!
B00005JLR2|4.0|This was a very underrated animated gem of last year which didnt get the box office attention it deserved. All the elements of classic Disney are here, and the plot works well in context. The only place where it falls short is a robotic character named B.E.N., who can be classified as a poor mans Jar-Jar Binks. A definite must for a DVD collector, mainly for the excellent sound and visuals.
B000001Y2U|5.0|this album is so dark , powerfull and great , so i am not one of those fools that say that this is the havviest album ever , i lisen to some black /death metal , but this is still great album<BR>tracks 1,4,7,10,13,15,16 <BR>are amazing the best certnlyi<BR>the others are an okey songs , some good parts , and some are avrage , but its no disturb (at least for me) its not bother me to enjoy this album from the start to finis, hope this one helped peace out
0385504209|1.0|I never think of myself as a Christian until my Christian sensibilities are affronted.  You do not have to believe in Christian theology to feel as if this book is like a large, cold mackerel in the face of religious dignity and tolerance.  How dare this man suggest that Jesus Christ fathered a child with Mary Magdalene.  You don't have to be a biblical scholar to realize that this totally misses the point.  Christ wouldn't have clambered up on that cross as a man if he'd been fooling around in the dust like a man.  But that's only part of my objection to this amateurish, insulting book.  Less like a mackerel and more like a cold and pasty blancmange is the prose style.  Inept is a word that would come to mind if I had the slightest belief that the author was even attempting competence.  Instead, this is a machine driven book, a book with rubber stamp characters against a cardboard backdrop, a book where each fatuous, barely-conceived character is given a comic book name.  And then there's the plotting, which is like a yowling cat in the backyard for hundreds of pages.  As if you don't see what's going to happen way, way off.  As if you can't identify certain plot points without the author's importunate &quot;clues.&quot;  Don't buy this one for a vacation--you'll be done with it long before the trip is over.  Remember: mackerel, blancmange, yowling cat.  That says it all.
B00001U0DP|1.0|What a pile of *.  This guy should be ashamed of himself.  Makes it look like the holocaust wasn't so bad, you just had to keep your spirits up.  Yeah just keep your spirits up while they were killing people at a rate of 20,000 a day at Treblinka, moving people off the train to the gas chambers as if it were an assembly line.  Just make a game out of it as your face is beeing smashed in by rifle butts and shovels.  Laugh while jews are being tossed alive into pits of fire.  Hey maybe for Benigni's next movie he can make a funny movie about 9/11.
B00008S2VG|2.0|This CD is totally different. Broken rythms, different lyrics, no consistent good melodies. Bits and pieces thrown in together. If you liked solid tracks on the Ray of Light you will not like this album at all. Wait for nice remixes instead.
078062999X|4.0|It is a crime that this version of Hamlet is not available on DVD.  It is made for the medium.  It is shot in 70mm and deserves to be shown letterboxed with high definition.  On 2 videocassettes, and pan-and-scan, the film is unwieldy.  <br />As for the actual movie, it will always prove indispensable to the Shakespearean tradition.  Whatever problems you may have with the film, it is the only cinematic telling of the ENTIRE text.  Sure, Olivier's version was great, but it was about half the text (he cuts out Rosencranz & Gidenstern!).  I am also fond of the Mel Gibson version (Hamlet as action hero) but the text is SEVERELY edited in that film.  The television versions are, by nature, very limited.<br />Seeing the whole text is an experience unlike any other (although I don't recommend it at one sitting).  Plots and subplots that are lost in other versions are retained here.  Branagh does a great job of directing, although he is over fond of a circling camera.  He populates the film with moviestars, which is a hit-and-miss affair.  Charlton Heston is perfect as the Player King.  Robin Williams is able to convey the comedy of the fop Osric.  On the down side, Billy Crystal is cast in the only other witty part of the film - the Gravedigger.<br />As for the principal performances, Derek Jacobi may be the definitive screen Claudius.  Ironically, the performance people may have trouble with is Branagh's.  Branagh's virtue is that he correctly sees Shakespeare primarily as entertainment.  Hamlet the movie is an ambitious project that he intends to be enjoyed the same way people enjoy The Godfather.  As a side-effect of this, sometimes he overdoes it.  When Hamlet is being sardonic, he affects an obvious tone to make sure we GET the joke, where some subtlety might have been better.  However, that is but a trifle here.  When Hamlet goes into his soliloquies, I still get chills down my spine.  In the main, his Hamlet is about as good a one we could hope for in this day andage.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna has made plenty of songs in the past that weren't the deepest or most profound ditties written or recorded, such as \\"Lucky Star\\" or \\"True Blue\\".  But they were always fun, catchy, and full of the spunk and attitude that made her famous.  Even her previous album Music held on to those qualities.  But her eagerly anticipated and as always, much hyped new release American Life leaves one wondering what she was thinking when she made this album.  Was she still reeling from her box office disaster Swept Away?<br />It's not as much her latest message that is to blame.  By now the public has caught on to the fact everything this woman says is smart PR move.  Though it's more than a little aggravating having a woman worth hundreds of millions of dollars advising the public to reassess their priorities.  It almost sounds as though it's okay for Madonna to have her piece of the pie but shame on anyone else that share the similar desires.<br />It's just that the music itself sounds shoddily put together and lacks any of the infectious flair of she is known for.  \\"American Life\\" is filled with more electronic beeps than R2-D2 and C-3PO in every \\"Star Wars\\" film put together.    The title track comes complete with an embarrassing rap in the style of Debbie Harry's from \\"Rapture\\" but fails miserably.  The fact she is rapping about pilates and Mini-coppers proves how far removed her world is from the average working American she has been criticizing lately.  On top of it, she snidely repeats the words \\"f**k it\\" over and over again in a sneering tone of voice.  <br />The song \\"I'm Stupid\\" should have been the title of the album.  On this track her voice is ten times more contorted than fellow legend Cher's is on \\"Believe\\", but without any successful effect.  It includes a drawn out shriek of her singing \\"I\\" for at least ten agonizing seconds in the beginning.  \\"Love Profusion\\" is calmer and more likable than the other tracks, but is not nearly as good as anything on Ray ofLight, her first collaboration with producer Mirwais Ahmadzai, who she teamed up with on this disaster.  \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" sounds like a reject song from the soundtrack of \\"Battlestar Gallactica\\".  \\"Nothing Fails\\" is a competent, more laid back number, but fails to help the album.  \\"Static Process\\" is Madonna's stab at folk music, but Joni Mitchell she is not.  And on \\"Mother and Father\\" she sings about her favorite subject, herself.  And the album comes complete with her James Bond theme \\"Die Another Day\\", which Sir Elton John named as the worst Bond tune in history.<br />Perhaps the queen of media manipulation and overexposure needs a long overdue break.  Either that or she needs to get of her high horse.   She was much better as a provocative and sexually charged entertainer than she is as spiritual advisor of guru.  Let go of the Kabbalah for a bit Maddona, and make the fun, sexy, danceable music that made you an icon.
1573225517|4.0|I got scared reading this book.  I thought, \\"Holy cow, this guy is describing me!\\"  Considering Rob, the narrator of High Fidelity, that is not a good thing.  We even have two of the same books on our Top Five (Red Dragon, and The Big Sleep).  Rob is always making top five lists.  The book opens with his top five break-ups of all time.  Rob has just broken up with Laura and is doing the top five list to put his life in perspective and try to figure out how his life went so, so wrong.  Hornby hits the nail head-on as to what guys are like and how they think.  As such, Rob may not be a likeable character all of the time.  He is actually very reprehensible in some respects.<br />Rob's whole life is CD's.  He owns a CD store.  I have the feeling he would hate me if he ever saw my CD collection.  He would hate most of us if he saw our CD collections.  He runs the kind of store where customers are booted out for requesting a copy of Stevie Wonder's \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You.\\"<br />This is a very funny book.  Hornby is full of great observations about modern life and relationships.  The main fault of the novel however is that there is no plot.  I often found myself not being pulled along with the story, simply because there wasn't one.  When I put the book down I didn't feel a NEED to pick it up again.  However, when I did pick it up, I laughed.
B000002WPI|5.0|No need for any review. &quot;Enter The Wu Tang: 36 Chambers&quot;,  A Must Buy Hip Hop album.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|It would be very hard for a person to walk away from Donnie Darko thinking that there was not at least some interest in the film. It is relevant to school life and throws in the typical issues such as censorship, the American obsession with self help philosophy and dealing with mental illness in the family. However these subplots alone do not sum up the meaning behind Donnie Darko. The film is haunting and keeps you feeling like there is something deeper to peer upon hidden in the plot. Even without understanding the movie you must at least walk away feeling something about the movie.<br />Donnie Darko is a confusing movie. After watching it for the first time I found that there was not one point in the movie that made it all fall in to place. Like other contemporary films eg. David Lynch films such as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive it leaves you feeling extremely frustrated. It makes you feel like you have missed the point and that there was an immense philosophical truth running through the movie that is only reserved for geniuses such as Stephen Hawking.<br />After reading different theories on the net about the meaning behind the film one is left to conclude this is yet another film that forces you to make your own conclusions about the meaning. This seems to be becoming an increasingly popular trend among modern films. I rated it 4 because I for one am becoming more and more frustrated with films whose directors feel they have the right to tease the audience (possibly because of free publicity generated by internet users posting theories about the meanings of movies). I'm not a genius and I hate the feeling that I have missed something when I watch a film, even if I watch it over and over again. Besides this I think it is a copout. A director should be able to imply enough meaning for a movie to make sense. Furthermore it can be done without spelling everything out and and it can be done without making everything obvious upon the first viewing.<br />Apparently the DVD extra features do provide more information about the storyline but still don't explicitly give away the meaning of the film.<br />I think the director was dealing with cliche philosophical problems such as time travel in new exciting ways which would make it a perfect film if it weren't for the frustrating lack of resolution one gets at the end of the film.
B00006F7S4|5.0|What can I say? Absolutely one of the best albums to be released in recent memory. Sure, if you want something that will pick you up or get your feet moving, this is NOT the CD to buy. However, if you are in a dark place or going through some tough period in your life - this album will commiserate with you. And everyone knows, misery loves company. Why do people that are sad like to listen to sad music? I don't know, but this will certainly provide some catharsis for you. Also, this album has such a gentle feel that it can easily play in the background while you retire in you recliner in front of the fireplace (or snuggled on a couch). Just don't focus on the lyrics if you are trying to create a romantic mood! Ignore them and let Beck's ethereal acoustics lull you to a better place. I believe in music that provides an emotion, making this CD reference material.<br />   Love looks away <BR>   In the harsh light of the day <BR>   On the edge of nothing more <BR>   Days fade to black <BR>   In the light of what they lack <BR>   Nothing's measured by what it needs<br />Tough times, indeed. Thanks, Beck!
B00004RFCM|5.0|If you haven't seen Sex and the CIty Season one, I won't ask you what's wrong with you. I will ask, however, have you been living under a rock? I was. This past fall a girlfriend turned me onto Sex and the City. I had seen a few episodes here and there and had enjoyed them. It wasn't until I sat down and spent three hours watching Season 1 that I realized I love this show. Let's meet the cast<br />Carrie Bradshaw - Professional Writer. Is also known as a shoe shopping addict. The series revolves around her column and she narrates at times. <BR> And who better to help her with her columns? Her friends!<br />Miranda Hobbs - Attorney. She is the independent type. Doesn't need help from a man, nor does she want the help.<br />Samantha Jones - PR Executive. She owns her own PR firm and enjoys having sex like men. No feelings, no emotions, just sex. And she has a lot of it.<br />Charlotte York - Art Buyer. She is the traditionalist in the group. She wants to get married, have kids, the townhouse in the city, the country home in the hamptons. She is looking hard for Mr Right. <br />Together these four women bring you into their lives and share with you their dating ups and downs.<br />Season 1 Is also the introduction of one of my favorite reoccuring characters, Mr Big played by Chris Noth (Law and Order)<br />Sex and the City is a must have. Watch as Carrie and Mr Big try to have a drink \\"thing.\\" Watch as Miranda is mistaken for a lesbian because she choses to be single. Watch as Sam has sex like a man, and watch Charlotte keep looking for Mr right in what seems to be all the wrong places. <br />If you don't want to buy it, rent it. Then you'll in love with it, as I have, and buy it!
B00008O31H|5.0|Who would have thought two boys from the midwest had so much soul and gutbucket kick to them! This is a fantastic disc with the raunch turned up to max.  This and their freshman outing brings back a vital edge to blues rock.  The fact that two men can make such impressive noise ought to scare the hell out of most four/five peice bands hacking their way through the commercial haze of today's charts.  GET IT, DO A SHOT, AND PLAY IT LOUD!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Kiki's Delivery Service was good. My Neighbor Totoro was cute. Laputa, Castle In The Sky was great. Princess Mononoke is one of my favorite movies of all time--an absolute jaw-dropping achievement. Now, we come to Spirited Away.<br />This is without question the best anime movie I have ever seen. It made me laugh (the soot balls are adorable! I want one! I want all of them!); it made me cry; it made me giddy (whenever Sen and her friends triumphed over Yubaba); it surprised me (can't say anything without giving stuff away); and it just moved me like no other anime has ever done.<br />Sen is a real, believable character who acts like a ten-year-old WOULD act if put into this situation. She is lost, confused, sad, angry, sarcastic, beligerent, kind, innocent, and friendly, all at the same time. She doesn't flinch in front of Yubaba, but gives in to her emotions after seeing her parents in the pigpen. She deals with the Stink Spirit without having to be prodded, and faces the angry No Face knowing that he could attack. She is not particularly beautiful physically, but by the end of the movie she is beautiful in other ways, including that way. She is not brave or daring--she tries to stop her parents from exploring, and she doesn't partake of the food herself (which is a good thing).<br />Lin is one of my favorite characters. Like Toki from Princess Mononoke, Lin has an attitude and a sharp tongue and is not afraid to use it. She is sarcastic, insulting, and borderline cruel to most, but to Chihiro/Sen she is almost like a big sister. I love what she tells No Face! (Those of you who have seen the movie should know what I am talking about.)<br />Haku is too wonderful for words. And his other form is SO awesome! He's handsome, kind, and I love his voice!<br />Anyway, Get the movie! Watch it! You'll love it!

B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna is always my pop favorite artist of all time, I have been really in to her since her 1998 Ray of Light. Her new album American Life is, honestly, a good album, but lack of variety.<BR>1 - American Life: good new breakthrough, but the weakest single<BR>2 - Hollywood: catchiest song, very relaxing mood, new breakthrough for Madonna for new kind of sound.<BR>3 - I'm so stupid: Rhythm and lyrics are good, music are excellent, there's nothing wrong with it honestly.<BR>4 - Love Profusion: another pop hit accompanied by guitar, lyrics are good, deep.<BR>5 - Nobody Knows Me: Despite I don't like the special effects used over her voice, but honestly, without it this song would sound less good, anyway, this is also a very catchy song, I love it, the rhythm is great, especially the part: \\"i dont want no lies, i dont watch tv, i dont waste mytime, on reading magazines...\\", It just keeps you moving<BR>6 - Nothing fails : probably the best song in this album, (after Hollywood), I hope its going tobe a single, and can be edited more at the background music.<BR>7 - Intervention: I do really want this song to be a single, its beautiful with the lyrics, acoustic guitar, especially the chorus, makes you feel so emotional, the rhythm also keeps you moving, you'll llearnt to like it after a few times listening.<BR>I also hope this song can be edited shorter (skip the guitar part at the end).<BR>8 - X-Static Process: This song is just like a prayer, very warm whispering of herself to jesus, when all around is quite, a very good song! a good message: apprieciate the value of yourself.<BR>9 - Mother and Father: Good song, except I don't like the fake voice shes trying to show at the end, it really annoys me.<BR>10 - It seems out of place, shouldnt be here at all, but its okay, its nice to have her Bond's theme in your collection.<BR>11 - easy ride: A good ending.<br />Overall, This is a album that opens up chapter 3 of Madonna's career, to all Madonna's fan, this is a must - have,really<BR>to those who are casual fan: this is a good album, but if youre looking for any dance hit, you'll be disappointed, this album means to be emtional and personal...<BR>Madonna we love you, keep going ! your music sounds better than ever!
0451191153|1.0|The successful philosophical or political novel is a rarity.  Of the former, Sartre's \\"Nausea\\" is a modern masterpiece.  Of the latter, I would nominate Zola's \\"Germinal\\" and Steinbeck's \\"In Dubious Battle\\" as leading contenders.  Of course, \\"War and Peace\\" and \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" present philosophical ideas, but neither is a novel in the traditional sense.  The secret of success in these endeavors is to to present the ideas through the media of sympathetic characters and a compelling narrative.  \\"No sense in useless tub-thumping,\\" said Zola.  Ayn Rand should have heeded that advice.  Her characters are mere types, employed repeatedly (and I mean repeatedly) as mouthpieces for specific points of view.<br /><br />There are three telling omissions in \\"The Fountainhead\\":  the first is that, although this is an epic tale, covering several decades in the lives of many characters, there are no babies born, no children reared.  I'm afraid a philosophy of selfishness has to go the way of dirty diapers when Baby arrives.  The second omission is humor.  There are no laughs here.  Egoism is a serious business.  The third omission, perhaps arising from the first two, is emotional warmth.  Ironically, Rand's essentially Humanist (that is, atheistic and anthropocentric) view lacks humanity.  Her heroine can only achieve sexual fulfilment through being forcibly raped, her hero's heart and soul are centered on bricks and mortar.  This novel will oblige you to think, but will not move you to laugh or cry.<br /><br />\\"The Fountainhead\\" is thought provoking, but in addition to the points I mentioned above, I was left wondering what the problems were supposed to be in relation to the architecture of the time.  This was the age of Art Deco and of Frank Lloyd Wright, surely a golden age in American architecture.  And is the era of the the Wall Street Crash, the Great Depression and Roosevelt's New Deal really the best advertisement for laissez faire economics?s?
1558908382|5.0|I first saw this during it's initial VHS release. The story is of Martin Blank, a professional Los Angeles hit man who is drawn back to his rural hometown to both attend his high school reunion and take on a contract to whack a guy. <br />One of the most well-written scripts of the 90's, in my opinion, doesn't work without John Cusack being cast as Martin Blank. He sold the role perfectly, and shines throughout the film, alongside a witty, phenomenal supporting cast of Minnie Driver, Jeremy Piven, Dan Akroyd and Joan Cusack. <br />Often mistaken as completely morbid, the film takes on not only a tone of humor, but that of vengance and morality. You must see this film.<br />The DVD, on the other end, [stinks]. Yet another incredible film thrown out there on DVD with a poor transfer and a trailer for an extra. The film sounds fanastic though, and scenes such as the Akroyd/Cusack gunfight and the destruction of the mini-mart can be greatly enjoyed with a good surround sound setup.
0804102988|5.0|I loved this book. We had to read it for my English history class and I thought that it was a perfect novel for this class. It was great how it integrated important events in British history into the novel. I highly recomend it.

B000002IWQ|5.0|Counterparts mixes the 80's power-pop accessibility of Presto and Roll the Bones with the live amp balls and patented Alex Lifeson heavy guitar riffs of the 70's albums.  This is one of those turning point albums in Rush's career like Hemispheres and Signals that summed several years of development and presaged a new direction for their music.<br />I hesitate to characterize this as a \\"concept-album,\\" but the undercurrent of human relationships runs through many of the songs.  Lyrically, this is my favorite Rush album to date.  Musically, all three musicians play with confidence and swagger without ever compromising the songs.  Though the guitar is back out front where it belongs, the playing is never over the top - it's punchy and ballsy and in the pocket.  Production is excellent.  This album sounds good played loud. Standout tracks include:<br />Animate - First track and as usual, the boys come out swingin'.  The song appears to be in the nature of an homage to the gentler sex, then Neal turns it around by acknowledging that there's yang to a man's yin when he writes \\"My counterpart, my foolish heart, man must learn to rule his tender part.\\"<br />Cut to the Chase - A rocker.  The break blows your socks off.  Again, the lyrics are great.  Neal is writing about maturity in this song with all the bravado of an angst rocker writing of rebellion.  It's \\"Anarchy in the UK\\" for upwardly mobile 30-somethings.<br />Lake Between Sun and Moon - Great mid-tempo rocker.  They played this one in Columbus on the Vapor Trails tour last summer.  Geddy introduced it by saying \\"we just forgot how much fun this song is to play...\\"  It was everything live that it is on the album.<br />Alien Shore - an anti-prejudice diatribe with a heavy riff.  A classic.<br />Cold Fire - In my opinion, Neal's best songwriting effort.  The greatest love song for the post-sexual revolution on the planet.  The only reason you haven't heard this song is FM radio's bias against this band.  This should have been a hit.<br />Everyday Glory - Rush traditionally puts a real winner at the tale end of their albums, and Counterparts is no exception.  As a guitarist wannabe, I love Alex's work on this one, rhythm and lead.  The simple, melodic solo is among Alex's best and fits so logically into the song it's almost like a song within the song.  Lovely.<br />If you are new to this band, this may well be the best place to start.  This is one of Rush's most accessible albums and at the same time demonstrates why Rush fans fanatically insist that these guys are the best players on the planet.  If you're a Rush fan who hasn't caught on to this album, God, correct your error now!  Even my wife listens to this one!

B000002BE9|4.0|I never paid much attention Fiona Apple's MTV appearances or her so called controversial behaviour. Maybe thats a good thing for me as I had no idea what to expect before I heard this album.<br />This album took me a bit of time to digest and after 2 years of listening on and off, I can confidently say that Fiona Apple is very talented and this is a pretty good album. Even more remarkable is that she was still a teenager while recording this as the compositions, lyrics and vocal work suggest someone far older.<br />The music is a slow paced mix of R&amp;B, blues and jazz with some hints of early Tori Amos - just listen to &quot;Never is a promise&quot;. Apple's vocal work is strong, husky and slightly rough in places - setting her apart from a lot of artists in the fold. This album commands attention and doesn't sedate or fade to the background despite its slow pace.<br />Highlights are: Sullen girl, shadow boxer, slow like honey and never is a promise. <br />Recommended!
B00006JK1R|2.0|I am starting to believe the hype that all great movies get disappointing sequels. I loved the original Men in Black. I think it was one of the finer movies released in the latter part of the last millenium, with great acting, superb storyline, and a sense of humor that was present in many of Will Smith's earlier films.<br />So, it's no surprise Men in Black 2 turned out to be quite bad.<br />They completely forgot everything that made the first movie so great, taking out Tommy Lee Jones' character, Q, (for a while), giving J a love interest, etc. I don't see why this movie was made to begin with. it was probably for the sole purpose of trying to make some easy money, because very little time and effort was spent trying to make this film good or watchable.<br />The humor that was so present in the original has completely disappeared. About the only time I laughed out loud was when J and his group of bug friends go to a family's house and push a button which unveils a weapons lab behind the wall. Other than that, nothing. The dog was not funny, the characters were not funny, and J made very funny few lines (besides the racist lines, which could be offensive anyways.)<br />The storyline is that an alien is coming to earth to secure a precious diamond-type metal which is the key to earth's survival.. or something. It just gets so confusing later on when it turns out it might actually be better for J and Q to GIVE HER THE DAMN THING, when they actually don't.<br />About the only thing I liked about this movie was that they actually had some sort of continuity this time. As we all know, at the end of part 1, Q wiped out his memory of MIB, so J spends most of this movie helping Q remember who he really is. It's too bad it can't save this dull effort.<br />Like I've said before, there's no reason to see this. It's boring, brutally unfunny, and the story stinks. I hated the characters, and most of the special features are boring as well. The bloopers are okay, but who wantsto waste time hearing what the worms thought about the movie? <br />It's quite sad when the best thing on the DVD is a music video for a song called &quot;Nod Your Head.&quot;<br />Please don't watch this if you value your sanity.
B00005RHGK|5.0|What I liked about this movie was that the creature wasn't just killing for the heck of it. It had a purpose. While he killed people, he was doing it to survive.<br />There are instances in this movie that you get creeped out by just seeing the monster. An example is when the kids are leading the police back to where they found all of the bodies. The second view through the back window did it for me.<br />I've watched horror movies all my life. It wasn't always slash and dash, disembowelment and hacking up oversexed teens who are drinking and doing drugs. Boring! The \\"Lady in White\\" and \\"The Ring\\" demonstrate that good writing makes a better movie.<br />The best monsters I've seen in a long are: the Alien, the Predator, and the monster from this movie. While they all have gross scenes, it's the creature him or herself that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.
B00008I8IF|4.0|\\"Rainy Day Music\\" is a welcome return to the musical style from the earlier days of the Jayhawks, and is easily their best release since the departure of Mark Olson.  The album offers a collection of finely-crafted tunes, with honest, stripped-down instrumentation.  Acoustic guitar is featured prominently, along with healthy doses of banjo, pedal and lap steel, and harmonica on some tracks.  Best of all the vocal harmonies are top-notch and virtually omnipresent. Song highlights include: the opening track \\"Stumbling Through the Dark\\" a simply beautiful melody that should rank with past tunes like \\"Blue\\" as among their best work ever; and \\"Eyes of Sarahjane\\" a bittersweet remembrance of a past love, with electric guitars and Hammond B-3 reminiscent of their 1992 masterpiece \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\". Louris sings, \\"I see Philly in the snowy gloom / We could have laid there 'til the afternoon / ...in the eyes of Sarahjane / I see the happy times again.\\"  <br />Other high points include \\"Tailspin\\", a twangy, upbeat pop-country gem; and \\"Angelyne\\" a wonderfully catchy song that will make you want to get up and sing along.  Many reviewers have panned the two O'Reagan contributions \\"Don't Let the World Get in Your Way\\" and \\"Tampa to Tulsa\\", but I thought these were worthy additions (though not quite as good as most of the Louris songs), and fit in well overall while providing some of the album's darker moments.  There are really no obvious flops on this record.  As noted by others, production is sparse, maybe a little too sparse at times, but the songs are just so good that it doesn't matter much.<br />I had just about given up on this band after their last 2 lackluster releases, but this one seems to have put them firmly back on track.  If you liked the sound, songwriting, and overall high quality of \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" and \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\" then you are sure to like this one.  But if the drum machines, electronics, and production gimmicks of \\"Sound of Lies\\" and \\"Smile\\" were more your thing, well then shame on you.
B00005JKPF|5.0|X2: the X-men United was excellent. It is definitely one of the best movies of 2003! The special effects were cool and its really hard not to like this. This action packed sequel is one of the best sequels Ive ever seen. Itll probably top the long list of sequels that are being released this year. The special effects were the most fascinating thing in this movie. There is also more character development. The story is great, the cast ensemble is perfect, and the special effects are visually stunning. The movie is inspiring, thought-provoking, funny. Most of the cast from the 2000 box-office hit returned. This includes the Oscar-winning actresses Anne Paquin (Rogue) and Halle Berry (Storm). Mystique is chubbier, Storm got a haircut, Famke Janssen got a trim, and Wolverine has a female version of him so yes, a lot has changed. Night crawler (Alan Cumming) is quite annoying but I like Kelly Hu. She makes a great female Wolverine! There are several memorable scenes in this sequel and the movie has all the charm that great movies need. The X-men movie franchise is in my opinion the best comic book to movie franchise ever. The movie gets quite crazy but it remains on the topic. Its the most expensive movie ever made in Canada! Its the most rambling superhero saga to date! <br /> It has everything that an excellent movie needs. It has a story, a theme, cinematography, a good score, a great cast, and impressive special effects (something that big destruction movies really need). This time the movie is funnier and its as fictional as a movie can get. It really concentrated on its fantasy storyline. <br /> The story revolves around the X-men, the good mutant group that consists of mutants, each born with a distinctive genetic mutation, which manifested itself astonishing powers. They live in a world that fears them but the X-men protect the people. They are Magnetos enemies. Magneto is the leader of the evil mutant group but is in a plastic prison at the moment. He escapes. In the meantime Wolverine travels across Canada in search of his whereabouts and meets a female Wolverine (played by Kelly Hu) and this continues the tradition of the fascinating kung fu moves in the X-men movies (The Mystique-Wolverine fight in X-men marked the beginning of it). The X-men face their most dangerous mission yet. They have to combat against their enemies, Magnetos gang, that threatens people and mutants too. <br />Overall its a thunderous, explosive, dazzling sensory overload that takes us into its world for over two hours but leaves us rather unchanged by the experience. Bryan Singer is such a good director that it makes you see why its important to have a director who was once the comic-books fan, direct the movie (same thing happened with Spiderman). The frustrations are without difficulty overshadowed by the fine look of the motion picture.
B00006AW2J|5.0|After a year of infamous drug busts and a spotty psychedellic release, the Rolling Stones came back with a vengeance on Beggars Banquet (but vengeance was always their specialty)! It seems as if the Stones were influenced a lot by the American sounds (old country and western, acoustic blues, and current folk music) and it wouldn't be long until other rockers would be influenced by the sounds on this album (note that Glynn Johns, the engineer on this album would later work for the Eagles). Here, the original toilet design is restored as well as their performance.<br />The 1st track is the controversial \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" which started out as a folk song and worked its way into a samba beat. Here, Mick Jagger recalls the history of evil in the world with tongue firmly in cheek, starting with the crucifixion of Christ and recalling the Russian revolution, working its way to the then-recent assassination of Bobby Kennedy (\\"I shouted out 'Who killed the Kennedys?,' when after all, it was you and me.\\"). <br />\\"No Expectations\\" is a lamenting blues dirge featuring a lovely slide guitar by Brian Jones (Brian's work was supposedly limited on Beggars Banquet, probably due to health problems and drug busts) and some standout bass lines by Bill Wyman. <br />\\"Dear Doctor\\" is a country and western style song, with Mick having cold feet on his wedding (his imitation of his fiancee at the end of the song is a scream, complete with a falsettoed southern accent- \\"Darlin', I'm sorry if ah hurt yew!\\"). <br />\\"Parachute Woman\\" is a 12-bar blues, with some wicked acoustic and electric guitars duelling and a snare drum march by Charlie Watts. <br />\\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" has some of Mick's most poetic lyrics starting with a tramp with a \\"mentholated sandwhich\\", then leading to a gangster who's really a \\"family man,\\" adding himself and the Stones into the picture, the anger singer (himself), a shy but flirtacious bass player (Bill), a drummer just trying to keep on top (Charlie), and the guitar players (Keith and Brian), well, they've just been \\"outcasts all their lives!\\", then concluding with 20,000 grandmas protesting to the queen. <br />\\"Street Fighting Man,\\" one of the 1st songs recorded for this album, features Charlie on a toy drum kit, Brian on sitar and Nicky Hopkins playing a chaotic piano lick at the coda (with Vietnam currently going on in the States, this didn't do so well on the charts). <br />\\"Prodigal Son\\" is an old gospel number (based on the story in Luke 15), with Mick singing in baritone, Keith Richards strumming away on acoustic guitar and Charlie provides an interesting drumbeat (John Bonham was probably inspired by this one, if you listen closely to Led Zeppelin's \\"Poor Tom\\" on Coda and \\"Bron Y Aur Stomp\\" on LZIII). <br />\\"Stray Cat Blues\\" is one of the raunchiest songs here (lyrically and musically), with Mick singing to a minour \\"I can see you're 15 years old and I won't want your ID.\\" Bill adds some moody bass lines and Keith lets loose with some raunchy sounding electric guitar licks. <br />\\"Factory Girl\\" is almost a relief, with its downhome country sound, a fiddle, a mandolin and acoustic guitars (Mick wryly sings of a girl with \\"curls in her hair,\\" \\"stains all down her dress,\\" \\"she gets me into fights; we get drunk on Friday nights, she's a sight for sore eyes!\\"). <br />The closer is \\"Salt of the Earth.\\" Joan Baez supposedly did a cover version of this song and the chorus of Tina Turner's \\"What's Love Got to Do with It\\" sounds a little like the opening line. Keith sings the 1st verse, toasting the hard working people and the \\"lonely at birth.\\" Mick takes over, asking us to pray for the common foot soldiers and then comments on the \\"faceless crowd; a swirling mass of greys, blacks and whites. They don't look real to me!\\" Then a gospel chorus reprises the 1st verse. Then the tempo picks up near the coda and Nicky plays a honkey tonk piano lick.<br />All in all, this album is a classic and has earned its status as many Stones fans' personal favourite (it's up there on my list!).
B00004XOWM|4.0|Limp Bizkit's third album I would say was very high up in the standards of Nu-metal and Limp Bizkit themselves!!!This album has taken a lot of critisism from unhappy fans and from media atention. Yes I agree it's not as good as Significant Other, but it is better than Three Dollar bill. Now put those two awsome records together and you've brought yourself a great album. The differance from this album and the last two is, that on this album there is a lot more umf to it, if ya know what I mean. Songs such as 'My Generation', 'Boiler' and 'Chocolate Starfish' all have that edge which make you get on your feet and bang the head that does not bang. I insist you buy this!!!!
B00008DDRX|5.0|This DVD is a must if you are a Sports Car Racing fan. The Video and Audio is unreal. Blows the VHS format out of the water.
B000067CPX|5.0|It seems that i seem to be one of the only reviewers who prefer this album to their older funkier stuff, but i reckon this album had the most effort put into out of all their albums, and the lyrics are much better than their previous albums. I got this album when i went to Australia for holidays and when i caught the plane back to New York, i was feeling a bit nervous and unrelaxed, so i placed this cd in my disc man, and i find it helped me relax and enjoy my plain trip. This is truly a beautiful album. This album is magic, it makes me feel like im lying on the beach on a nice sunny day. This album also contains some very nice blues, and my mum usually hates my cd's, but this cd my mum loves. Its very hard to choose as a favourite track but i personally think &quot;throw away your television&quot; would be, because it has a very nice bassline and the drums are awesome. The red hot chili peppers really do have one of the best bassist. This album also contains very slow romantic songs like dosed, and the zephry song is a very smoothe, nice song, which makes you want to go to the beach. The only song i don't like is &quot;can't stop&quot; which has very bad vocals, and the bass and guitar riffs where a bit too punky funky for me, but any way if there had to be something that bothered me about this album, it would probably be the vocals, this cd has under average vocals, though the bass and wonderful lovely music makes up for that. This album also has very nice string arrangements in &quot;midnight&quot;. All in all go get this album if your into bass, like blues, or like nice smoothe rock or get if your a red hot chili pepper, though please note, it is totally different to their other albums, and really, get it if your a metal fan, because i like bands like pantera, system of a down and tool, though this album still pleased me. Im glad my 8th grade friends recomended me this. THANKYOU FOR READING-peace
6303160344|3.0|BLUE is one of a trilogy of films from France that also includes WHITE and RED. I suspect that the naming of the set is in some way related to the French tricolor flag rather than Old Glory.<br />The plot seems simple enough. Juliette Binoche plays Julie, the sole survivor of an auto accident that kills her famous, composer husband and her young daughter. After release from the hospital, she discards or sells everything from her previous life. With only a box containing a ceiling lamp comprised of cut pieces of BLUE glass on a multitude of hanging threads, she moves to the big city, presumably Paris, where, with the help of an apparently large personal bank account (because she doesn't work), she sets up house and begins the process of re-connecting to her emotional self.<br />The film director's vision is apparently that the viewer infer what is going on inside Julie by observing her face in close-up. (And what an exquisite face Binoche has - I could lose myself in her eyes!) Whether Julie is interacting with the her husband's composer friend who loves her, or the boy who found a necklace at the scene of the accident, or the promiscuous young woman who lives downstairs, or the family of mice in her closet, or the lawyer charged with selling her old home, her facial expressions are really all we have to deduce the turmoil of her inner space. Even when Julie discovers a surprising secret about her husband's life, her overt actions and speech are remarkably non-expressive of what she must truly be feeling. Somehow, what I perceived in Julie's countenance wasn't always enough, and I arrived at the ending credits vaguely dissatisfied.<br />I concede that BLUE is a classy production, but it must be too subtle for my proletarian tastes. But, if you're in love with Juliet Binoche, see it anyway.
0440237688|4.0|This is a book that is colorfully written by Lois Lowry. This is a science fiction book that has a lot of ambition of what a perfect community would be like. I think that this one of the best books that I have read in a long time. <BR>    This science fiction book is focus around the main character (Jonas). Jonas a t Age 12 gets the privilege of the receiver of Memory. His teacher is an elderly man by the name of The Giver. The Giver is the Receiver of Memory before him. During his training he is given the memories of the past world. He alone knows what is to feel pain, fear, hunger, and many other emotions. When he se's his father do some thing of complete horror to him he decides that he can't stay in the community much longer.  So he runs away with the help of The Giver. <BR>   This book is one book that you could read over and over again. It is even easy enough for a 10 year old to read. But in the end this is a good book.
B00008972S|5.0|Its hard to review a film like &quot;West Side Story, that has been cannonized as a film classic. All I can do is try to relate the joy, energy and wonder I feel everytime I view this movie. This is one of those rare instances in film history, where commerce/box office success intersects with great art to create an entertainment legacy, that is truely special. We all pretty much know the story. It is a modern, musical retelling of Shakesphere's Romeo and Juliet.Instead of aristocratic families, we have poor NYC youth gangs(Jets &amp; the Sharks), who battle for territory and respect.Two young lovers (Tony &amp; Maria) from the opposite sides try to end the violence, but ultimately their love cannot overcome hate and biogtry.Where do you start with what makes this movie great? Do you begin with the talented youthful cast? Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood both are wonderful as the young lovers, who make the ultimate sacrifice. Likewise Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno and George Chakiris give amazing performances as young people, who are caught up in a world that dosn't seem to understand their need to explode in violence. The entire cast is just fantastic and never gives us a false note of acting. Then there is the music. The Leonard Bernstein/ Stephen Sondheim songs such as&quot;Tonight&quot;, &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Somewhere&quot; and the rest of the score have become enshrined in our cultural consciousness. Everytime I watch this movie I unknowingly start singing along to those wonderful tunes, that just seem to stick in your brain and make your toes tap. Finally there is the brilliant Choreogaphy of Co-Director, Jerome Robbins. The only word that comes to mind is 'GENUIS', when I see the dancing at the gym or during the songs &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Cool&quot;.How did he get the actors to move like that? The story, music and dancing all comes together under the artistry of Robbins and his Co-Director Robert Wise, who both share the responsiblity for the creation of this filmmaking masterpiece.&quot;West Side Story&quot; has now been lovingly remastered in a 'Special Edition', two DVD set.If you are a fan of this movie, then you will be in heaven with the tons of extras included. Most prominent is a great one hour documentary called &quot;West Side Memories&quot;, which includes both home movies, original vocal soundtracks, and interviews from actors and production people. Also included along with the DVDs is a 150 page book, that has the script, publicity materials and reviews from the original film release.

This such misterious way is Music (Art).<br />Many
0385507755|4.0|I love the style.  The omission of quotation marks and use of capitals on certain letters (e.g. Parent, Addict, Criminal, Girlfriend) are both well employed techniques.  The story takes the reader in immediately.  I read this book almost straight-through, and I seldom do that.  There is a spot were it drags a bit around pages 250-300ish, but it is very much worth the read.<br />I find it interesting how, despite the author's objection to twelve-step programs, he still does a very thorough first, fourth, and fifth step.  Of course, the central problem of the book is doing the twelve steps if one is an atheist.  In other words, is recovery possible if there is no &quot;power greather than ourselves&quot; that can restore us to sanity?  Frey argues that if AA has only a 15 percent success rate, and so long as he himself has been successful maintaining his sobriety, then his method is just as good as AA.  I would stipulate to this fact on his behalf; lots of people quit drinking through weight lifting or spirituality or art without AA.  And I myself have grown tired of the arguments regarding genetics and disease.  There is a small, but significant, portion of the population that quit drinking without AA, which people in AA are loathe to admit.<br />Essentially, this is a coming-of-age book, and it is a very good one at that.  The protagonist wakes up at 23 not having had an adolescence, so he has his during the two months in rehab.  He rebels against his Parents, discovers love, and finally learns to be a man.  This is a touching, lyrical, violent, gut-wrenching, funny, and very accessible work on growing up and getting rid of the worst demons imaginable.
B00005JLXC|1.0|The commercials were better than the movie because most save 1 thing that was good was in the commercials. Jennifer Garner got hustled. All the kicking butt in the commercials, was just in the commercials. She didn't really do ANYTHING and was a waste of a good charachter. and the bossman...1 word. Why? Okay he's strong, how'd he get so strong?<br />DareDevil has developed other senses ok cool, but he's a regular guy so now he's suddenly a great gymnast with super-strength??? Now I know you're not supposed to look for much plot in these movies but you gotta have some better action than that to distract me. Last thing, Nobody's going to bother to explain why Bullseye has a Bullseye on his head huh?<br />More effort people,... Batman pulled it off.
B00008S2VH|3.0|I was initially surprised and impressed by the very different music on the CD.  The title track, \\"American Life\\" is enjoyable enough.  I think the rap just ruins it, but it's probably the best song on the CD.  I also particularly liked \\"Hollywood\\", \\"Love Profusion\\", \\"Nothing Fails\\", and \\"Die Another Day\\".  <BR>I was very disappointed, however, that many of the songs sounded very similar and the lyrics for all tracks are sickeningly repetitive.  The so-called Enhanced CD includes some icons and a downloadable audio file.  Save your money and buy the regular CD.
B000002NIW|5.0|Amazing album that grabs you into its sounds. Adrenaline boost for all whom listen. ...
B00003CXI0|5.0|The movie was a great take on the book!  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are extremely delightful!  To the reviewer that compared it to Star Wars:  you have obviously been stuck in your basement doing nothing but being depressed that you could not think of such a great idea!!  To the others reviewers that know when a great movie comes out:  treat yourself and see it again!
0671027344|5.0|Review The Perks Of Being A Wallflower\\"<br />The novel \\"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower\\" by Stephen Chbosky deals with the problems and feelings of an outsider. <BR>Charlie, who is a high school student, needs somebody to talk to, and starts writing letters to an anonymous person.<br />During the novel his life is filled with high ups and low downs.<BR>Incidents like the deaths of his friend Michael and his aunt Helen, or first experiences with drugs and girls influence him and his character development.<BR>The fact that he is highly intelligent and shy at the same time makes him become a \\"wallflower\\".<br />A great book, that gives you an insight into the life of a teenager and reminds you of your own childhood.
B00008DDXB|5.0|This movie is a delightful sequel to the first Harry Potter!  You do not need to read the book to watch the movie but it is a great bonus!  It contains more sports, adventure, and magic than the first!!!  If you have not seen it yet, treat yourself!!!!
B000002IOJ|5.0|This is the first Testament album I bought, way back in '89.  Let me say that I haven't gotten tired of listening to it for all these years!  It is absolutely amazing!  Chuck Billy is too cool for words.  And the lyrics say so much; especially check out &quot;Perilous Nation&quot; and &quot;Greenhouse Effect&quot; for some astute political comments that still hold true today (unfortunately).  And the music, well, I can't say enough good things about this album.  If you like metal, you will never regret buying this album, you will only regret that you hadn't gotten it sooner!
B00005JLKN|5.0|I read the book &quot;Red Dragon&quot; some years ago now and then promptly watched &quot;Manhunter&quot; on DVD which I thought was a very average film - and it really didn't do any of the characters justice.<BR>I saw &quot;Red Dragon&quot; on holiday last year and I wasn't really expecting much. Sequels &amp; prequels never really turn out to be as good or as inspired as the original do they? Well this one does!!<BR>Edward Norton gives an outstanding performance as does Anthony Hopkins in this superbly crafted thriller which finally does justice to Thomas Harris's book. If you were disappointed with the film &quot;Hannibal&quot; then beleive me...this film is much better, and slots in nicely as the prequel to &quot;Silence Of The Lambs&quot;. <br />Do yourself a favour, rent or buy this film now!
B000002ITM|5.0|I have been a Testament fan for 14 years, and this is definitely my favorite album!  Every single song on here is great.  If I am in a bad mood I pop this CD in and I always feel better.  Chuck's beautiful voice is amazing.  Even my kids ask me to play this album in the car, and they usually complain about any other metal I play (and we're talking the good stuff like Maiden and Anthrax!)  I say definitely buy this album, you will not be disappointed!  Testament rules!
B000067CPX|4.0|Seriously, every song is really, really good. The Chili peppers have slowed down the pace on this album, continuing on from \\"californication\\", the tunes are melodic and each in its own right is a masterpiece. <br />The worst song IMO is \\"cabron\\" and even that is not that bad. This album still has some funky-rock/rap songs such as \\"cant stop\\", \\"By the way\\", \\"Throw Away Your Television\\". \\"Tear\\", \\"Dosed\\", \\"This is The Place\\" are slower rock songs, all very nice. \\"zephyr song\\" and \\"universally speaking\\" are worth mentioning aswell. <br />I give it 4 stars because Californication is better (afterall it had \\"otherside\\", \\"road trippin\\" and \\"scar tissue\\"). This is not like Blood, Sugar. If you want classic chili peppers get that, but if you prefer slower melodic rock, get \\"By The Way\\" and \\"Californication\\".
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This is not the &quot;ear candy&quot; of Tango in the Night or Mirage.  It's much closer to Tusk, in that it's an often experimental, push-the-envelop effort.  As a result, witness the wildly divergent reviews posted here.  As for me, I'd follow Fleetwood Mac, and Stevie especially, anywhere, and I'm perfectly happy to follow them here.  Even more, I give the band members much credit for taking such artistic changes.  This is NOT Celine Dion or Shania Twain:  future-Muzac crafted to offend absolutely no one.  Not all tracks work (at least in my initial listenings), but my God, this album contains 18 songs!  Wouldn't you rather have all the songs in your collection, so you can decide for yourself which ones you like?
B00008DDRX|4.0|OK, how many of you are reading this review and will see this film because of its great dramatic reputation?  Not many, I suppose.  Le Mans is perhaps the truest film for pure racing, and racing fans.  Along with Grand Prix, its perhaps one of the best films about racing ever done.  There's very little dialog, and half of that is silly.  There's a small attempt to add some drama, and this is put into context by the fact that Steve McQueen walks out on the girl to go back to the race....<BR>McQueen plays an American driving for the Gulf Porsche team.  His great rival is a German who drives for Ferrari, and evidently there was some drama between the two at the Nurburgring during a previous race.  McQueen was also involved in a fatal accident the previous year, and its strongly implied he had a relationship with the driver's widow.  She hangs around the pits of Le Mans almost like the angel of death, actually, until some attempt is made to insert romance in her relationship with McQueen.<br />The dialog is sparse, which is probably just as well;  if you see this film, watch it for the racing.  No other film captures the speed and drama of real racing as well as Le Mans.  Much of the footage came directly from the race and was perfectly edited into the film:  it all plays smoothly.  The rest of the footage was shot with real cars and real drivers at real speed, and it shows.  The result is almost a documentary on Le Mans.<BR>There's a famous quote from former driver and sometime commentator Sam Posey.  He was asked what was the fastest he's ever driven, and he replied that it was around 235mph on the Mulsanne straight at Le Mans (formerly the longest straight in motorsports) driving a Porsche 917.  The person comments on the speed of the car, and Posey says that he really wasn't sure exactly how fast the car was - it was still accelerating at the end of the straight!  The point is that this film captures a good part of the awe and drama of the speed of the place.  For anybody who loves racing, its not to be missed.<BR>As to the DVD, the print has some small dirt specks and a little noise occasionally but is otherwise pretty good:  the picture is nice and sharp, and color is quite good.  The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is perhaps one of the best remastering jobs on a 70's era film I've seen.  Its not up to modern standards but its still really good.<BR>So...  3 stars for the silly drama, 4 stars for the print and 5 stars for the racing.  I'm guessing if your idea of racing is a bunch of loud cars going around in circles this isn't the film for you, but if you love it, this is an experience you'll enjoy and won't readily forget!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I recommend this CD to anybody who enjoys LP, Creed, Nickelback, or any band similar to those.  It is very similar in feel to Reanimation and Hybrid theory, but new lyrics and some new beats.  Great cd- 5 *****
6305252521|5.0|When you watch the first hour or so of this film, you get this feeling almost like you missed a part of the movie and don't quite understand what's taking place. By the time the last half hour arrives, you can clearly see what it was all leading up to... and that is one of the most inspirational endings you will ever see. If you like feel-good movies and original cinema as much as I do, then it is probably one of your favorite films too.     Such an outrage that this gem was largely overlooked at Oscar time... Didn't those unbelievable critics reviews (\\"the movie of the decade\\", etc.) mean anything to the academy???
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth: one of the most acclaimed bands in progressive metal, because of (despite?) their shifts between heavenly atmospheres and brutal heaviness and death growls -- a band that has won over metal fans, progressive metal fans & metal prog fans, and critics alike -- a band that continues to prevail over expectations and mature in various respects.<br />And so we turn the page to another chapter in the Opethian saga, _Damnation_. If Opeth has any doubters remaining, this album will reverse their opinion or at least dice their credibility. As almost everyone knows by now, _Damnation_ is the \\"mellow\\" counterpart to _Deliverance_, which was their heaviest album to date. Its songs therefore converge entirely in the softer side of Opeth's sound. However, I would like to emphasize that this is _not_ a collection of typical mellow Opeth songs, which most people were seemingly expecting. You should not assume this is an album of songs like \\"Credence\\" and \\"Harvest\\" -- _Damnation_ establishes a different sound but maintains their identity. This is still unmistakably Opeth, from the atmosphere to the production (Steven Wilson is a genius) to the pristine excellence that is Mikael Akerfeldt's voice.<br />Even though it is the shortest Opeth album (eight songs, 43 minutes), it is probably my favorite. My reaction actually surprises me, since my allure to Opeth is largely their dynamic of light and shade. The symbiosis of those roaring black slabs of surreally powerful metal fluidly merged with the warm embrace of their placid, elegiac side is no small part of what makes them so powerful. But despite leaning entirely to one end of the Opeth spectrum, _Damnation_ is just....perfect -- unspeakably well-crafted -- preternaturally beautiful -- enthrallingly poetic.<br />Of course, it _is_ a \\"mellow\\" album. There is no metal, no growling, not even any parts that would be considered heavy by anyone but Grandma. Even though most people associate \\"mellow Opeth\\" with \\"acoustic guitar Opeth\\", _Damnation_ is primarily an electric guitar album (with Steven Wilson's enchanting mellotrons and pianos appearing at times). The difference, obviously, is that the soul-withering crunch of _Deliverance_ is replaced with a distortion soft as falling leaves and chilling as a late summer rain. Akerfeldt's acoustic guitars still convey that sylvan atmosphere, but they usually supplement the electric guitars rather than replace them. Arrangements can be gorgeously transparent and light, sometimes little more than cellophane pulled over vocals. \\"Weakness\\" is a prime example of this crystalline sound in viscous minimalism.<br />\\"Mellow\\" it may be, but the music does not lack ntensity. \\"Death Whispered a Lullaby\\" has a tortured, silvery solo that sounds like a mix between Tool and old Norwegian black metal. \\"Closure\\" is in my opinion one of the heaviest sounding Opeth songs yet, even though it is far from metal. It is heavy because of the plodding, extreme density of whole arrangement. Even the first stanza, just acoustic guitar and voice, is nerve-racking on its own. The middle and closing instrumental sections involve a frightening, devilishly soundscape. The guitar figure remains mostly the same but galloping drums, crunchy bass, and pallid distortion build and shift according to some twisted orchestration. Since this is one of the heaviest Opeth songs, the transition into the gorgeous  \\"Hope Leaves\\" is all the more effective. This is probably the most beautiful Opeth song to date. A languished, frightened Akerfeldt sings over a simple funereal chord. It hits with an added sadness when you think the line \\"And I know you will never return to this place\\" is directed to \\"hope.\\"<br />\\"Windowpane\\" is one of the longer songs and phenomenally gorgeous. Spirit-melting guitar solo, complex yet beautiful chord harmonies -- with some measures more beautiful than any the finest Sigur Ros soundscape or the most enchanting King Crimson. Haunting lyrics and lush vocal harmonies a laPorcupine Tree. \\"Ending Credits\\" is an instrumental that sounds like the continuation of \\"Epilogue\\", from _My Arms, Your Hearse_. A harrowing melody possibly influenced by Eastern European folk, supplemented by keys from the shadows, with mellotron here instead of Hammond organ.<br />This is their third album produced by Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson. Wilson's talents as a musician are also used for in the ghostly keyboards throughout the album -- no synthesizers, however. They are organic, warm instruments: mellotron, grand piano, and Fender Rhodes. \\"In My Time of Need\\" is like dreamy symphonic rock due to its mellotron and slow harmonic rhythm. Wilson also wrote lyrics to one of the songs here, \\"Death Whispered a Lullaby\\". Wilson may as well be a member of Opeth, because I believe he has become essential to their music (those background vocals!). The Wilson/Porcupine Tree influences in Opeth's music have a lot to do with *sound* (the guitar tones, vocal harmonies, and vocal recording especially), but Akerfeldt himself is also adopting some of Wilson's singing characteristics. Otherwise, I'd say the influences -- like Camel and other Akerfeldt favorites -- and ideas are too well-assembled with ingenuity to reduce _Damnation_ to a mere homage. In the end, it can only be defined as Opeth.<br />The rhythm section shines like never before on _Damnation_. They have always an impressive rhythmic mainstay in this quartet (especially on _Deliverance_), but here they are given more breathing room and eloquently add to the music in more ways. The bass of (severely) underrated Martin Mendez remains deep and heavy despite the music's overall lighter tone, but he beautifully engages the low-end to beautifully enhance the sound rather than encumber or merely follow it. Martin Lopez understands the needs of the music perfectly, and his hammering death metal drumming is stripped down to something that enhances the music in a more subtly articulate way.<br />This masterpiece leaves me quivering like a post-coital concubine. This is ranked highly among my most beautiful music ever, but it is a unique beauty -- a silent lacuna between rock and metal -- the eye of the storm -- complex and haunting and unforgettable. Whether you are an Opeth fan or not, you MUST check this out. It is a special treasure. If it doesn't resonate immediately, continue exploring (it didn't do much for me on the first several spins). Like all of Opeth's albums, _Damnation_ reveals many secrets as its complexities unfold. I think _Damnation_ is probably the vastest of all their experiments, which is an exemplary feat. Opeth is a mythic band worlds beyond metal. Together with _Deliverance_, _Damnation_ reveals Opeth's finest work to date.<br />Note: The limited edition digipak is WAY nicer than the jewel case.a Porcupine Tree. \\"Ending Credits\\" is an instrumental that sounds like the continuation of \\"Epilogue\\", from _My Arms, Your Hearse_.

0385504209|5.0|once you start reading it you wont be able to put it down.  The only negative thing that this book has on its readers is that it interferes with your everyday life!! Im dead serious, i had dreams about the book thats how much I loved it.<br />  Brown is an amazing writer, he has a wealth of knowledge about everything under the sun (btw that was not a pegan refrence).  Unlike many writers of history, Brown actually creates a great mix of history and fiction, so much that you dont know when the lines are being crossed, and that i loved. I am trying to be very carefull in reviewing this book because it is filled with so many plot twist that any little hint thrown at you might reveal more than you wanted to know.<br />I found it puzzling that this book was an intellectual thriller with some some great and unexpected plot twists that involved a great mix of history, art, codes, religion, betrayals, and the list goes on and on, yet some twists that Brown wanted to make suprising were already figured out way before he revealed them to the reader. I felt that he failed to keep up with his own writing at times and got lost and didnt know how to recover. Even so my mind was stimulated to a great extent, i learned a wealth about ancient religion and rituals.<br /> All these groups throughout history are in search for the Holy Grail yet i dont find the significance in aquiering it, it seems kind of sad to me that these groups have spent their whole existence searching for the Grail not knowing if it exists or not, it just seems like a waist of time when their is so much more that could be done with the  money and time spent searching for it to help society. Im getting carried away here, but i was honestly moved by the book, like i said it stimulated my mind the way so many few books do, so for that reason amongst the hundreds of others i recommend this book to anyone with the slightest inkling of intelligence to read this book, you will not be disapointed!!!
0312265859|4.0|Probably all of the folks reading this review have read the other seven Stephanie Plum books by Janet Evanovich and are looking for word on whether the eighth ('Hard Eight') is worth the bother.  The answer: yes.  But it could have been better, and I recommend the author injecting something new and exciting in the next installment.<br />'Hard Eight' is the usual pastiche of bounty hunter babe Stephanie Plum working herself out of ridiculous situations.  In 'Hard Eight' the author presents a rather straightforward and fun story involving a missing mother/daughter and the baddies who are chasing them.  And of course we are delighted with the nutty behaviour of the criminals, Stephanie's friends and her co-workers.  And yes, in 'Hard Eight' Stephanie finally consumates her friendship with Ranger.  While this should have been a hilarious episode the author oddly doesn't milk it for all the laughs it's really worth.<br />Bottom line:  sort of a \\"been there, done that\\" Stephanie Plum novel.  Not a classic but well worth the bother.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love the sound of her voice and the soothing instruments that accompany her! Each song has a similar 'sound' but the lyrics are truly unique. (wish the songs were a bit longer though) It's definitely a cd to listen to while curled up in front of the fire with a glass of wine, or just to relax after a hard days work! Can't wait for her next album!
0316666343|5.0|I won't bother going into what the book is about since the other reviewers have already done so...but as someone who has lost my best friend to a brutal and sensless murder...reading this book comforted me in many ways.  It made me feel as though she really is up there in her own heaven, watching over what i am currently doing...and that just makes all I do all that more important and meaningful to me.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever experienced loss.  the loss of a friend, a family member, a spouse...it will make you wonder, cry, and smile...Wonderful Job!
B00005I44H|5.0|I have heard very positive things about Perahia's Mozart for many years. We have his recordings of the Schumann Fantasy and the Schubert Impromptus for a number of years and have enjoyed them both a great deal.<br />Recently I heard that Sony had reissued all 27 of the concerti in a box set at reduced cost. Sony has trimmed the cost with this set by issuing a box set without a booklet. Each cd comes in a laminated paper liner. The great news about this set is that you get 10 superlative performances of the greatest concerto literature ever written at a bargain price. <br />Perahia has an immaculate nimble athleticism in his fingers, which is a requirement for this repertoire. His use of articulation and tonal color is always tasteful, and his melodic lines always sing from deep within. An interesting feature about this set is that Perahia uses cadenzas by Mozart, Rudolf Serkin, and others, as well as ones Perahia composes himself. The only possible fly in the ointment is that the piano is a hair too bright of an instrument for my taste. But to have all this for Amazons list price is a bargain.<br />Don't be tempted by Naxos' offerings in this literature. At this price, you have no reason to go with an anonymous player when instead, you can have one of the greatest pianists alive playing literature which truly suits him. <br />We also have the Uchida/Tate box set also. I love that one as well. Both of these artists have given humanity a precious gift: incomparable Mozart!!
0375410341|5.0|I can definately say I was surprised to see a mountain of negative reviews for this book, when I came to this page.  Personally, I loved the book.  The concept is phenomenal!  The writing isn't shakespeare, but it never wanted to be!  It's something raw, something dark and painful.  It doesn't have the intricate plot of a Ludlum or Grisham book, but it has life and emotion, something lacking in most novels these days.  This book is definately an experience.  It's a poem, one that cannot be missed.
B00008J4P5|5.0|It's difficult to be objective about a piece of work after reading rave reviews by experienced and respected music critics. I fell in love with the White Stripes a year and a half ago when I bought &quot;De Stijl,&quot; their second CD. It knocked my socks off. Then I saw them live a year ago in Royal Oak, MI, and once again got blown away. Then I listened to &quot;Elephant.&quot;<br />What I'm amazed about is the creative and innovative music Jack White produces. On the one hand, there's nothing new in the way of a genre, yet every song is an individual gem. It goes beyond just the songwriting; the production is perfect.<br />I hear Nirvana (Little Acorns), Black Sabbath (Hypnotize), Led Zeppelin (Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine)and of course, Jack's love of blues underscores it all. And he does it all with such freshness.<br />One way I gauge the influence a piece of music has on me is: do different songs constantly go though my head? Do I wake up at night with them up there? &quot;Elephant&quot; has at least 7 songs that do that to me. I've had to leave the CD at home when I travel just to take a break; I play it over and over when it's with me, ignoring other music I have.<br />I'm 50 years old and have been listening to rock 'n roll for 40 of those years. I remember being amazed when I first heard the Beatles, and Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Al Green, Talking Heads and especially Springsteen (whom I was able to see in concert 4 times before 1980--best rock show(s) of all time). The White Stripes give me the same thrill as those and other bands; they have the same passion and intensity. And that wonderful, explosive excitement that grips me when I listen to them is priceless.
B00004S876|5.0|I really don't have that much to say but my family bought this album as an LP from a Thrift store for a dollar and it has become one of my favorite ablums. At first I only listened to side 2 (Afraid of Love-Africa) But a few months ago I flipped it and fell in love with that side too. I can't get enought of this album! I'm going to wear down the needle with how much I listen to it O_o So yeah, it's an awesome record and I'm glad it was in the bin so we could pick it up!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This movie has all 3 versions of the movie. more special features than you'll ever be able to appreciate and still retains the disney quality you expect from the last great disney movie.
B00005NWLO|4.0|First off, this is worth buying just because of the rarity of a live performance. This is one of the best live rock bands to ever pour whiskey on stage (more on that later). These guys were the warmup band for The Who until The Who noticed that people were leaving before they came on. Flat out, one of the alltime American rock bands. They cover some songs on this album that are not on any studio albums. What is disappointing is that this could have been even better. The sound mix sounds like the guy mixing it got far too loaded as the concert went on, and the mix gets worse as it goes along. In addition, the band got completely [drunk], and as the concert goes on, their playing suffers. At one point, Van Zant can't remember the words to a song, and you can hear one of the backup singers say \\"Whiskey, Baby\\". It's still a great album, but so disappointing that they were not at their best due to pouring down a few hundred gallons of booze.
0060537639|5.0|Years ago I heard that a child told a teacher, &quot;Columbus did not discover America.&quot;  &quot;Of course he did,&quot; said the teacher.  &quot;No, he did not,&quot; insisted the child, &quot;the Indians were already there.&quot;<BR>That is what came to mind when I read Menzies' amazing book 1421 The year China discovered America.  We may know that the history we have been teaching is, at times, prejudicial and wrong, but will we change it?  Will historians take a long hard look at Menzies' evidence and set about to prove whether or not it is indeed true, or will they just scoff at it and reject it out of hand?  To reject it is easy.  To take the time to verify it will take far more energy than some may have.  There is far too much in this book to just blandly say, &quot;It is not true.&quot;  Did the Portuguese have some prior knowledge of what lay across the Atlantic?  The facts are there.  Are our historians honest enough to take another look at our accepted history?  I think so, and I can't wait for them to do so.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This CD is probably either his best or second best to Until the End of time. If you like 2pac or the outlawz you gotta buy this album its one of the best cds ever out there. It's got a lot of variety on it.

The 1 hour docummentary has got to be best I've seen in a DVD yet and the reason is very simple: few filmakers have gone through such lenghts to bring their vision to the screen as James Cameron has with the Abyss. To think he went even further with Titanic ! It's a shame that DVD edition is so very plain.
B00001MXXH|5.0|This is one of the movies that reminds me most of the 80's when I too was a high school student thinking along similar lines &quot;I'm not European, I'm not going to be European, so why do I need to learn about European socialists?&quot;<br />I suppose you can say it's dated, most things take on the trappings of their time.  Ferris Bueller has almost become emblematic of them.  Still, dated lingo or not, the movie was and is, at it's heart, just pure fun.  Remember, life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and looka round once in awhile you'll miss it.
B00006J3T4|5.0|At 47, I am a long time fan of Mark Knopfler's work.  I like a good love song as much as anybody but I am always looking to MK for music which takes me to other times and places and introduces fascinating characters.  To me, his music often seems like a scene in a good movie.  His masterful and distinctive style is becoming nearly as fully realized as one of his own personal icons, Chet Atkins.
B000083E79|5.0|This is a terrific find--&quot;The Very Best of Cher&quot; cd single packs a punch.  This disc (it's regular size) doesn't contain any of the more recent very dance dance danceable trax the old gal's been putting out, but you do get treated to a very persuasive love song (#7), a song of inspiration (#1), a song about the wild wild west (my personal favorite, #4), and a great literary number about time travel (#2).  It's all a bit more than I expected for a cd-single and the price (unfortunately) reflects that.  I don't much care for the cover so I replaced it with a carefully drawn sketch of toad dressed as a washerwoman.  Recommended to one and all, without hesitation.
B00000K44W|1.0|I remember when this was originally released, and I remember how fast it went to the bargain bin with the other cutouts at the local record store. I remember because I BOUGHT it from the bargain bin (I'd been burned before with \\"War Child\\", and I'd heard the obnoxious single \\"Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young to Die\\", so I wasn't taking chances). And even though I only paid a buck or two for my copy, I still regretted the purchase. Nowadays the only song on it I ever, ever play is \\"Moths\\".<br />Enough about me, however. It's worth noting, that although Jethro Tull had been in artistic, critical, and popular decline since just after \\"A Passion Play\\", this album, \\"Heavy Horses\\", is the album that knocked it permanently off the top ten. Something to think about.
B00004TDW7|5.0|While it doesn't quite match his greatest, XO, Elliot Smith's most recent album, Figure 8, is absolutely amazing.  My particular favorites are &quot;Son of Sam&quot; and &quot;Junk Bond Trader,&quot; the latter being my absolute favorite of the album.  This album just flows perfectly, from beginning to end.  Songs like &quot;Everything Means Nothing to Me&quot; and &quot;Between the Bars&quot; give you that warm feeling inside and make your spine tingle and your face turn red (at least thats whay they did to me).  After you get XO, buy this album.
0790720434|5.0|I loved this story so much when I was younger.  Shortly after I had first had the story read to me, the movie of The Secret Garden came out.  It was just as enchanting as the book.  I immediately fell in love with it and watched it over and over again.  For my 9th birthday, I decided to have a Secret Garden theme.  This movie, along with The Little Princess, occupied many hours of my thought and many moments of my make-believe play time when I was younger.
B00005JM93|5.0|I have not seen a film this thoroughly gratifying for a long time. Every time I pay to see a film I feel as though I've been stripped of my money. Before this film, the last film that I enjoyed as much was Amelie, which is a completely different film, and I haven't seen anything satisfying since. <br />Irreversible takes the same chronologically reverse format as over-hyped and under performing \\"Memento\\", a movie that I did not enjoy because there was no reason for it to go in reverse. It was all a gimmick to cover up the fact that the story was weak. But Irreversible makes it work. In the first 10 minutes of this film about 10 people left the theater, which I consider a thinning of the herd. This film is definitely not for the squeamish. I pride myself for not being shocked by anything in films, and this film really got my attention. <br />In the opening scene of the film, which is the climax, the camera is all hand-held and seem seems never to cut, or move away from the action. It is amazingly violent and disturbing, but not gratuitously. Gaspar Noe, the director, does not shy away from showing the underground world of \\"The Rectum\\" in its true form. Watching the opening moments I felt as though this was my incarnation of hell. The scene ends with Marcus and Pierre (Vincent Cassel and Albert Dupontel) violently murder a man with a fire extinguisher. Usually in movies the camera pans away and we hear what's going on, but in this case, the camera catches everything. <br />As the movie progresses back in time to the momentous rape of Alex (the angelic Monica Bellucci), the camera sits on the floor and captures the entire rape in one take, one angle, without ever cutting away. It is by far the most honest and chilling rape scene I have ever seen. Alex (Monica) is a supremely seductive, powerful and independent woman, who is dually vulnerable and delicate. Her emotional transformation in this moment, the fear and apprehension of loss of life is apparent in Monica's facial expressions and her non-acting style of acting.<br />The camera seems to be a witness of Alex's bargaining with the rapist pimp, Le Tenia (Jo Prestia), to her beating, and the long-lasting rape. By the end of that scene, I felt as though I was rapped. The dialogue is as true as I can imagine it to be in such a situation, and throughout the entire film. <br />Towards the end of the film, or the chronological beginning, we see Alex and her boyfriend Marcus (Vincent) waking up in their apartment and having a very casual and intimate conversation, without rushing through it. And without saying anything about the plot of the film, it reveals so much about the two characters and their relationship together. <br />The film ends with a bird's eye view of Alex reading a book at a park with children playing around her. The camera spins in circles and gives a feeling of such tranquility, a major contrast from the start of the film. <br />This film stayed with me for an entire week and I dreamt about it that night. I recommend this film thoroughly to anyone who can stomach honesty in violence. There isn't a trace of Hollywood in this film and I think that says it all.
B000067J1H|5.0|When this movie first came out I had no real desire to see it. All of the publicity was about how violent the movie was and there was not much mention of anything else. I was a bit of a David Fincher fan after The Game and Seven and I really like Edward Norton, who in my opinion is the finest actor of his generation, but I still thought who really wants to see a movie about people knocking lumps out of each other for 133 minutes? I certainly didn't and so weeks went by until one of my favourite UK movie magazines published their top twenty movies of 1999. What was top? You guessed it, Fight Club. But I still wasn't convinced. However, I'd seen everything else that I'd wanted to see and Fight Club was about to leave the theatres and on the basis that every review of the movie in the UK had been five star I felt I had to see it. I didn't expect to enjoy it but I kind of felt that as a supposed film buff it was my duty to watch even if I was going to hate it.<br />I couldn't have been more wrong, I was blown away by this movie. It was nothing like I expected and nothing like the hype. And it's not just a guy movie either, I watched this with my wife and she loved this movie as much as I did and at the end she turned to me and said one word \\"wow\\"! Sure there is some very realistic and gorey fight scenes in this movie but to characterise it as a mindless bloodfest is to do it an enormous disservice. This is an incredibly powerful movie that pulls one surprise after another. It has an incredibly original script, excellent direction and wonderful acting. Not only is the ever fantastic Edward Norton better than he's ever been before (or perhaps ever will be) but he is ably supported by Brad Pitt (who I'm generally not a great fan of) as the charasmatic anarchist and soap salesmen Tyler Durden, the superb Helenah Bonham Carter totally cast against type as Marla (in what should have been a multi-award winning performance) and Meat Loaf. Yeah, Meat Loaf in good film, understated, funny, good acting shock!!! Who would have believed it? Not me but then Fight Club is that kind of movie, it is nothing like you'd imagine.<br />I don't want to give the plot of the movie away in case you haven't already seen it. To my mind the best way to watch a movie (and in particular this movie) is with no prior expectations and an open mind. This movie is a rollercoaster ride that will take you places and directions that no movie has taken you before. How good is it? Well, I read a magazine interview and Edward Norton stated that when he and Brad Pitt watched the movie for the first time, Brad Pitt turned to him and said \\"you know this is the best movie we will ever be in\\" and Edward Norton agreed. That's how good it is! Darkly comic, a visual and verbal assault on the senses, Fight Club is perhaps a movie before its time that has divided (and will continue to divide) audience opinions to the widest of extremes. Does it have a deep and meaningful message? Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't, who cares? Whatever, in my opinion Fight Club beats the hell out of most other movies and fully deserves five stars.ted, funny, good acting shock!!! Who would have believed it?

B0000691TJ|5.0|Too Tough To Die is a very exciting listen. The Ramones were in a slight rut by the time the mid 80's hit. But this album totally brings back the sound of their earlier work but it also delves into new territory by adding a few synthesizers.  It also is the first and only record to have an instrumental called \\"Durango 95\\".  Dee Dee and Joey turn in some great written songs with Dee Dee's \\"Wart Hog\\" which is one of the most hardcore punk songs ever, and Joey's \\"No Go\\" has one of the most lovable melodies to it.  There is no fresher or funner album in the Ramones 80's releases as Too Tough To Die.
B00005JHAB|5.0|This movie could not be any more perfect! Mathhew and Jennifer fit togther perfectly. I cried at the end of this movie!! I loved it. You have to see it. :)
B000002LHT|4.0|Brain Drain is a highly under rated album. It has alot of songs that could have been hits, but poor production made it a turn off. It has great songs like &quot;I Believe In Miricles&quot; which was a good opener for the album.  &quot;Zero Zero UFO&quot; and &quot;Don't Bust My Chops&quot; are great rock n rollers.  While &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; should have been a hit, so should have &quot;Can't Get You Outta My Mind&quot; and &quot;Ignorance Is Bliss&quot;.  The album ends with two sour notes, 1. &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; should have not been the last song<BR>2. Sadly this was Dee Dee's last album<BR>Brain Drain is a better album, but prolonged listening might drain you.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Damnation is probably the weakest album by Opeth but that doesn't mean it isn't still far better than 98% of the music out there waiting on the racks for some bubble-gum snapping airheaded teenage girl to snap up based soley on her aesthetic apreciation of the pre-fabricated soulless abominations on the waste of plastic.<br />*ahem*  </rant><br />Taking less from the Death Metal arena and more form very floaty psychadelic 70's progrock (you can really feel Steve Wilson's Pink Floyd-ish injections here more than ever before), Damnation is a brooding jazzy exercise in extremely odd timed progressive metal (rock?) that left me feeling unsatisfied after the first few listens, but has grown on me to the point where I can highly apreciate what Akerfeldt and the boys are trying to do here.<br />Dissatisfied becuase there's something missing here, and I'm talking of course about the death metal that we've all come to know and love from Opeth.  It wouldn't have been totally innappropriate to have an occasionally brutal riff or growling vocals on this album to offset the accoustic dronings, my freind katsudo summed it up best when he heard this album \\"It's awesome but it's too soft for too long\\"  Opeth breaks it up a bit with the end of \\"Closure\\" where the guitars build to a crescendo, but never realize their full potential as the song is literally cut short as if someone hit the \\"pause\\" button and just went to the next song.  Come on Opeth, finish your songs.<br />The strongest part of this album is ironically \\"Windowpane\\" which you'll hear first.  Perhaps this is why I was disillusioned at first, waiting for a song to conquer the first I found none to even live up to.  Ready to slather on a panning 3-star review I promised myself to give it a few more spins, it needed to grow on me.<br />And it did, after a fashion.  This album is wonderful in it's seemingly random complexity and jazzy progressions, but will probably get played less than Deliverance or even Blackwater Park.There are too many minor flaws for this album to ever achieve perfection, which is shocking coming from Opeth.  I thought they were perfectionists, as their previous music has shown.<br />The baselines are some of the best Opeth has done, and the twin guitars (one jazzy the other accoustic) lend a floaty prog feel to this album that brings up such names as Porcupine Tree, King Crimson or even Pink Floyd.  The use of mellotrone is very appreciated, as Opeth had previously gone mostly without using keyboarded instruments in their music for a long time.  The mellotrone drones in at seemingly pefect times, lending an air of fullness to songs.<br />Fullness, that's what Opeth needs here, their rougher songs are very full and as for softer ones just listen to the hearty \\"Harvest\\" on the Blackwater Park album.  But here the songs lack an essential fullness that the mellotrone thankfully steps in (too infrequently) to fix.<br />The drumwork is, as usual, brilliant.<br />The vocals are very soothing, Akerfeldt sounds downright depressed on this morbid sorrowfull album as his voice floats over soft progressions and sings of death (what else)<br />In closing if you are an Opeth fan, a fan of good music, or Progrock/mellow metal then you need to have this album.  Hopefully Opeth will do another one like this but won't be afraid to get gritty when the songs call for it, which they do often enough.
B000002L9O|3.0|This is unfortunantly, the Ramones weakest album. Animal Boy lacks alot of substance due to the growing bad relations between Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee.  They were not getting along so in turn they were not getting any good material. Not to say that there are absolutely no good songs here.  \\"Love Kills\\" is a good song written for Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen by Dee Dee.  \\"Somebody Put Something In My Drink\\" which was written by new drummer Richie is a great rocker, but the adding of synthesizers to a drinking song does not work in my opinion. \\"Freak Of Nature\\" is a good one, and so is \\"Bonzo Goes To Bitburg\\". As the rest of the album goes, its best if you leave Animal Boy locked in a cage.
B00005J6SZ|2.0|Madonna Like A Virgin turned Madonna from a hot dance and pop act to a huge superstar. the title track Like A Virgin was a instant hit and in 1985 Madonna was everywhere. She scored few hits from this album and three other hit singels from her box-office hit movie &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; Into The Groove and two songs from the movie &quot;Vision Quest&quot;  Gambler and Crazy For You. She was called the Material Girl and her Like A Virgin tour was a huge sucess. She married the actor Sean Penn in mid august and she became also a tabloids dream. <br />So what about the album itself Like A Virgin. Unlike the predecessor she has gotten rid of the dance and r&amp;b producers, struggling writers to make living and she has now hired the top pop producer Nile Rodgers to help her to make her dreams fufilled and sadly he fails. <br />The songs that I really liked were Like A Virgin, Material Girl,Dress You Up and Shoo Be Doo. Otherwise this album was a plaine bore. The songs were untiresting, poorly produced and flawed mess. Madonna´s voice is more annoying on this album then on her previous self titled debut.<br />Her self titled debut worked a lot better as a whole and had so much going for it. It was also well organised and produced. But just 4 songs out of 9 doesn´t work for me. I Am not sure wether Madonna still likes this album but in my opinion is her worst along with Music and American Life.
B00005NRO3|5.0|All I can say is that this could have been an Oscar nomination.  In all seriousness!  Naturally slasher movies give off a rather cheesy vibe... but noooooo!  Not the first two \\"Scream\\"s.  They have a certain spark.  The acting is absolutely fantastic, the plotline is phenomanal, and the  slasher costume is higly original.  I love this movie as much, if not more than the first.  Don't rent... BUY!!!
B000002MUW|3.0|In 1993 Madonna was a tabloids dream. She had released her sex book and the album Erotica as well as the terrible film Body Of Evidence. The girly show was a sucess however with all that it seemed that some people had gotten bit tired of Madonna and Erotica was a commercial disapointment. Also many critics and journalist panned the sex book and Everything seemed to be falling down. <br />in 1994 she decided to put her clothes back on and she wen´t into the studio to work on her next album. <br />Bedtime Stories is a R&B flavoured album. It contains some hip hop tracks, some ballads and a bit of dance and one electronic track<br />Bedtime Stories is musically great album however lyrically it can often be dull, self-indulgient and boring. Her voice is sometimes streched to much and it sounds sometimes that she is not having fun while making this album and Madonna is a bit shallow at times especially on Human Nature were she adresses critics and people for not not liking the whole sex book thing. Even though they have indeed right to have an opinion.<br />Bedtime Stories is also a bit dated. You just know while hearing it that it was made 1993-1995. <br />But as we come to the real deal and skip the flaws Bedtime Stories is enjoyable album. It is soulful, danceable and the production and the arrangements are good. Overall grade 7/10.stars
6305903182|1.0|Admittedly, I've seen worse sequels... but the originals were [bad] along with them.  Why would you ever do Scream 3 to such excellent movies like Scream and Scream 2?  This movie is flat out horrible!  Acting, gore, plotline, and ending.  It seems like the writer had no clue where it was going to end so he just threw in little bits and pieces of everything.  Its all just one big slap in the face to the end.  I do NOT recommend this.<br />P.S.  Scream 3 is not the final installment in the series.  Prepare for Scream 4 sometime in 2006.  Neve Campbell will be back along with david Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Patrick Dempsey.  Wes Craven will be back also.  The filming was just declared in April 2003.  Pray this will be the one to bring back the series's name.
B00005J6T1|3.0|In 1983 an unknown club singer and dancer named Madonna released her debut album. Her first single Everbody was a huge Dance Smash in the clubs and on R&amp;b chart. Originally Madonna was labeled as a black artist and the single was aimed for a black market. Nobody had seen Madonna on television or in interviews and bought the album. <br />Madonna´s debut album comes as a surprise because it is pretty good album when considering dance and pop albums. Her voice is a bit annoying and sounds very girlish and at the time when the album was beginning to sell some critics thought she used another singer or a machine to make her voice to sound like that (In those days people used to sing their own songs opposed today where a lot of pop stars don´t sing at all and they get away with it). Production wise the album is good. The songs are well producer,arranged and performed. It is very dancable and catcy. <br />Lyrically it is good considering that these are dance tracks. Madonna wrote 5 songs on this album alone. the tracks Borderline, Holiday and Physical Attraction were written by somebody else. <br />Although it is not exactly a perfect album it has a lot good qualities to it and is much better then Madonnas to newest albums and her follow-up to this album Like A Virgin which I have to say is Madonna´s most overrated work to date.<br />Overal grade 7/10.
630521610X|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 10 and it scared me so bad.  Now, watching it... I still feel afraid to be alone.  This is one of those movie that grabs you from the start and drags you through every bumpy road until the end.  You'll laugh, cry, and then walk away petrified that this could actually happen and that the characters are very true-to-life.  I still love this movie with and undying passion.  Buy it now if you haven't yet seen it.
0800177975|4.0|If there was ever any movie that celebrated Arnold Schwarzenegger movies it's \\"Last Action Hero.\\" Actually, this film celebrates action movies in general. Directed by action legend John McTiernan (Hunt for Red October, Die Hard), this fantasy film about a kid named Danny who goes inside a Schwarzenegger film is loaded with nonstop action, some good laughs, and tons of cameo appearences, including: Ian McKellan, Robert Patrick, Tina Turner, Chevy Chase, Jim Belushi, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Little Richard, and Danny DeVito as an animated cat! This film brings in loads of fun, and the casting of Charles Dance as the villain is genius. Sure, this film isn't perfect, but if you're an Arnold fan it's plenty fun. Sometimes, the movie even works as a spoof of action, like in the car chase scene where literally every single car explodes. This film really isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's actually one of my favorite Arnold films. I'd recommend this film to the child-at-heart; to the people who never really grew up. It's fun for the kid in all of us.
B00005LC1H|5.0|If you like classic British humour, then this is great!  I'd watched<BR>most of the episodes before, but it's nice to have all of them in one<BR>place.
B000000XCF|5.0|When asked about their favorite CCR album, most fans predictably respond in favor of &quot;Cosmo's Factory.&quot;  Although I generally agree with the populace on the quality that album, my favorite is definitely &quot;Willy and the Poorboys.&quot;  What appeals to me most about this album is that it seems a little quieter then  preceding ones. Two songs that have a strong influence on this mood include CCR's covers of the folk songs &quot;Cotton Fields,&quot; and &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, both of which are executed beautifully.  &quot;Don't Look Now&quot;, is a also a great, folk sounding tune, carrying a very profound message that takes many listens to even begin to understand.  Of course their are also the two widely popular and highly overplayed classics &quot;Fortunate Son,&quot; and &quot;Down On the Corner.&quot;  Although they are both great songs, I prefer the lesser played songs, because they are also wonderful, and I haven't heard them as much.  I think what makes this band so great is that they offer a place of solace and escape from the rigors of our daily lives.  This group of four musicians from Northern California created a whole musical mythology about the old world of the Bayou, digging deeper and deeper into the roots of the south, meanwhile creating a sound that is both historical and timeless.  All of this is pretty phenomenal considering they weren't even from the south.  For anyone with more then a passing interest in Creedence Clearwater Revival, &quot;Willy and the Poorboys&quot; is a definite buy.
0066214122|2.0|I've read virtually everything written by Crichton, because the<BR>technology is well presented, and the story is usually fun to read, at<BR>least.  But in 'Prey,' the technology, as described, is not even<BR>self-consistent, and the story reads like a screenplay.<BR>Disappointing.
B000089A07|4.0|well this DVD has excellent sound systems and provided if played with the right DVD system this can be quite a treat. I believe this DVD is the best of all the hannible series and is a movie that really makes you think
B00005JKPF|5.0|I am not a self-avowed comic-book junkie, but after having loved the original X-Men movie (2000) and being totally hooked by the trailers for the new film, I was first in line to see it opening day.<br />The underlying story for this movie is an extension of the first one, only we know most of the characters and don't spend nearly as much time on their back-stories this time around.  The mutants are in trouble again, and as in the first movie, Xavier and Magneto go head-to-head as to whether the mutants should try and resolve their issues peacefully or via war with non-mutants.<br />The effects are AMAZING.  This movie is almost non-stop action but also reveals more about Wolverine's past and furthers the development and screen time of more minor characters from the first film (like Iceman).  There's also a new enemy, Deathstrike, who is AWESOME.  The battle between Deathstrike and Wolverine is the best in the film.<br />Long story short, THIS MOVIE ROCKS!  Great story with a great (but non-preachy) message about tolerance, great effects, and the 2 hours+ flies by.  The first of the summer blockbusters is definitely here.
B00005JLEU|2.0|I watched &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, after reading so many reviews about how it was the greatest thing ever created. I saw so much creativity involved in the process, but the plot holes were so deep I couldn't pull myself into the movie. I'm glad so many people find this movie wonderful, and hopefully I will watch it again someday and see that I am wrong. But I doubt it.
B00006F2TV|5.0|Spider Man is a great movie. It encompasses all the great aspects of the real comic book hero (super strength, webs, alter-ego of Peter Parker, Spider Man's origin, Aunt May, Mary Jane, etc.), as well as Spider Man's most famous enemy, the Green Goblin.<br />The movie is flawlessly done, complete with stunning special effects, a good story (it's the complete story of the Green Goblin), and the romance between Spider Man and Mary Jane. The scenes of Spider Man swinging between skyscrapers are awesome.
B000025H0Q|5.0|How can a mortal man such as me describe the absolute perfection found with-in the immaculate album Bryter Layter? This album could very well be the soundtrack to life its self. From the song \\"Introduction\\" which sets the stage for allowing the rest of Bryter Layter to fall perfectly into harmony with your soul. The song \\"Northern Sky\\" is so much more than just a song. I think it is what heaven will sound like. I hope to have that song played at my funeral someday. When I listen to this album I imagine as each song plays through that those songs are the steps we take to get through each day. It blows me away to think that Nick Drake was only 26 when he died and yet his music makes us feel as though he lived a full life time. I hope that wherever Nick is now he knows how much his music means to us. His music is a rare gift that we are so very lucky and blessed to be listening to. It's seems like having an eternal state of communion with God. Thank you Nick for giving us a little bit of heaven on earth. You were one of God's own angelic messenger's.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Whether you enjoy classical music or not this is a great CD. You can envision the orcs marching across the fields of Rohan with the metalic beat of drums. A sign of a truly great movie is a fantastic soundtrack like this one. Buy it now you won't be sorry.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dylan blew my mind with this one!  I mean, the guy is already a living legend. He could have never released another album and no one would have questioned it. Instead, not only does he release a new album, but it just might be the best of his career!<br />Why? Well, Bob is in top lyrical form on Love and Theft from beginning to finish. He's full of sarcasm, wit, and humor (which was not displayed at all on 1997's Time Out Of Mind). <br />The music is timeless! And I mean that literally! Based mostly on the blues, Dylan seems to jump from delta blues rock to 40's crooning to turn of the century folk to countrified contemporary rock and sometimes all at once! It is simply amazing... and when it rocks, it really ROCKS! Leave it to the 60 year old to show us how rock n' roll is done in 2001. <br />Bob's voice is rough, but unlike Time Out Of Mind, he seems more comfortable with it and they actually fit very well with the style of these songs. <br />And most importantly, Love and Theft is fun. Haven't heard this much fun on a Dylan album since Bringing It All Back Home.<br />An amazing achievement from one of the greatest artists of our time.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|i'm just making my experiment with the movie i've rented i.e. just watch and turn off the sound and i find this movie's pretty boring people sit down talk talk stand up walk and talk it seems nothing's really happened and all of the roles look not so interesting so i don't have patience to watch it again...i mean formally. but all the things in it like Will's car and house and his friends' apartments, shops and the goods in them and the scenery of the city(which one is it? London?) are great.
B00004SCX6|3.0|When talking about Britney Spears, you need to remember a few things. Her voice is not very good, and her music becomes out dated in a year or so. When I first got this in 2000, it was all right, now it's worst. Britney likes to come up with stuff that will give her the #1 album, but then dissapoint you with the rest of the songs. \\"Oops...I did it again\\" is basicly like \\"Baby one more time\\" except now we learn that Britney likes to fool around and cheat on her men (is that really a message we want to give to young girls?) \\"Don't go Knockin' on my door', \\"When your eyes say it\\". and \\"Where are you know\\" are not memorale at all! I can barely remember what there like because there filler tracks, (which she does a lot of). \\"One Kiss From You\\", \\"Don't let me be the last to know\\", and Can't Make you love me\\". are just regular pop songs that sound like there from her first cd. And who can forget \\"Dear Diary\\" one of the worst songs on this album that Britney co-\\"wrote\\". It basicly says, I really like this boy, does he like me? through out the whole song, but it's written as if it was from a diary. I gave this cd 3 stars instead of the 2 I gave her first album, because some of th songs, did change Britney, and can be fun pieces of fluff to listen even now. \\"Stronger\\". Britney's version of \\"Satifaction\\", What U see\\", and \\"Lucky\\" are the ones I'm talking about. Although Britney will be forgotten by the time she is in her 30's, she is still ok... for Brit, that is. She can in no way be compared to Madonna, or even Christina (how no matter that you think of her, her voice is much better than Britney's). I hope someday Britney will start singing about men instead of boys. And write about peronal struggles instead of songs of wondering if a boy is as horny as she is.
B00006V9A0|5.0|To Kurt, Krist and Dave...From, Your loyal fan forever!!! Peace, Love, Empathy.<BR>I do wish we could have gotten more rarities on this one.The record company really knows how to \\"milk it\\".
B00006BTCA|4.0|'Turn on the Bright Lights' explores the same kind of urban and millenial tensions I hear on my old Joy Division albums.  No that doesn't qualify them as a \\"Joy Division rip-off.\\"  Where that band met their times with icy disconnectedness, Interpol revels in their age's boundless thirst for cheap drama.  \\"I'm sick of this town,\\" go the lyrics to \\"Say Hello To the Angels,\\" but these guys are married to New York the way Lou Reed was married to heroin.<br />This record caught me off guard; I picked it up knowing nothing more than it had generated significant buzz.  Expecting to hear a garage rock record, I was shocked to find a set of grand, sophisticated songs that manage to match their substance with style.  Frankly, I'm just happy, in the year 2003, to be listening to a band whose definition of \\"rock\\" is broader than Rhino's 'Nuggets' box set.
B000001A9P|5.0|Stevie Wonder, with a great band, live in Japan and Isreal. This is one of Stevie Wonder's best albums. A great start for new fans, and a 'must have' for Stevie veterans. Classic and familiar songs are performed in a new and fresh sound. The band is magnificant, the classical arrangements fit perfectly, and Stevie is clearly enjoying himself. <br />It's all there: previously unreleased songs (you won't ever get tired of listening to &quot;Dancing to the rhythm&quot;), his best-known stuff (no need to list those), and lesser known gems (&quot;if it's magic&quot;; &quot;overjoyed&quot;). Of course, every fan has his/her special favorite that's missing from the album (where is &quot;As&quot;?), but you can't get 40 year's of genius on 2 CD's.<br />If you only buy one Stevie album, buy this one - you won't regret it, ever!!
B00004W221|5.0|I have to admit I never really knew who Sean Astin was till after I saw his wonderfull turn as Sam in Lord of the Rings. And I didnt seek out this movie just because I enjoyed LOTR ,  I actually bought it cause the price was right (cheap), I needed something new for us all to watch and Im trying to build up our DVD collection. Well ...Did you ever go to a movie everyones saying great thing about and then afterwards think \\" I spent 8 dollars for THAT!\\" or go to a bargain movie and think afterwards \\"Wow! That movies worth 8 dollars to see again\\"<BR>Well \\"Rudy\\" is def worth FULL price!  And its one to see again and again. How many movies can you say that about these days?<BR>Great acting! Wonderfull story! Its the kind of movie you wish they would make more of..The kind your glad you invested your time and money in.
B000001EHS|4.0|Well I think the songs of the album are great, however, to be a hits collection for a band like Def Leppard, it are too few songs, I think, it should be a double disc, with 15 or 16 songs in each cd, with 2 new singles, but analizing the cd, I think they choose good songs, a lot of Hysteria (which is my favorite Def Leppard album), but there are not songs as Tonight, Action, Stand Up, I wanna touch you, woman, that were hits too, but it aren't too much the Def Leppard style, I think they should do another hits compilation in the 2003 or 2004, with song of their latest albums, which are not really great albums.
B00008H2LB|2.0|Wow. This was disappointing. I first bought Hybrid Theory two years ago, and loved it. It was just the right balance of scratch, rhymes, and heavy riffs. Meteora does this, but too much. So many people say \\"It's the heaviest thing I've ever heard!\\". Oh, please. It's all about the lyrics they say. Well, when the music blatantly [stinks] you can't stand to hear the words. Shinoda does his rapping thing with Chester wailing like a monkey in the background. He has two modes: scream, and sing softly. The bass and guitar riffs are plodding and the scratches are annoying. Buy Tool or System of a Down with your money, rather than waste it on 37 minutes of screaming, scratching, and bad riffs. Unless you like that kind of thing.
0385504209|1.0|I was at first very intrigued and taken by the book's cryptographic orientation and the writer's style, UNTIL I began to realize that it is really all about undermining one's Christian-oriented worldview and belief system and replacing it with today's move toward Mother Earth/Goddess worship and New Age attitudes and beliefs.  About halfway through the book, you'll discover that the author begins to have his characters discuss basic doctrines of Christianity and how the world has been deceived into believing them for the past 2000 years.  Then the reader is subtly introduced to pagan beliefs that have indeed been around for thousands of years and how they are present, all around us, even within the church.  The problem lies in that the reader is left with the impression that they should begin to doubt their own beliefs and take everything the writer says &quot;on faith&quot;, without doing any research for themselves to see if there is any merit to the new twist given to the Christian story.  The book's own storyline hinges on believing that Christians have been wildly deceived and that there is in fact no basis for that worldview.  If you read this book and begin to doubt if what you've been taught is true, please research for yourself just how much substantiation is available for the validity of the Bible--trust that it can stand up to scrutiny even worse than that proposed in this book.
B000065V1V|3.0|Bowie's best work is undoubtedly from the 1970s up to Scary Monsters(1980) or Let's Dance(1983). From there, he took a nose-dive in quality. Personally, I've greatly enjoyed his comeback albums- Outside(1995), Earthling(1997) and even Hours(1999). However, I think Heathen(2002) is a step back: musically, it's simply not as melodic or interesting as his 90s work; lyrically, it's a bit flat. (This is probably due to the departure of Reeves Gabrels, Bowie's long-time song-writing partner.) Overall, a solid effort, but hardly deserving of all of the exuberant praise here.
0440133688|5.0|To heck with this being for med students and interns anyone who deals with patients should read House of God.  I remember reading this for the first time in nursing school fifteen years ago.  I've read it several more times since then and always find myself laughing out loud.  In spite of it being a hilariously funny book it is also a cautionary tale and believe it or not one that I have used daily in my nursing practice.  Everytime I lower the bed of a disoriented patient I think of it as preventing a turf to ortho, or (God Forbid) a turf to neuro. When I work with new medical students I often watch them \\"hearing zebras\\" and it reminds me to be supportive and helpful. I will honestly say that this book is not for the lay man.  It can come across as brutal and unfeeling when in reality the point behind this book is to never stop feeling.  Just don't let it kill you and always remember it's probably better to hit 'em with some 'roids.  Great Book!
B000088E6D|2.0|It's amazing to me that so many people are ranting and raving about this album. What a bizarre creation it is. Not only is the choice of tunes competely erratic, but the band and singer are so stiff, that it makes you feel tense. Sure, the band is comprised of a bunch of hot shots and fantastic players, but put them all together, and you have a bunch of egos fighting to be heard. As for Mr. Buble, lighten up and swing, man...you and your band need to have a martini or two...
0375414053|5.0|This book is very funny. Kate Reddy is a pathetic mother and woman for the majority of the book, but her insights and observation are so dead on they might scare you.  After I was repulsed by her self obsessed behaviour, she manages to redeem herself and I found myself actually liking her by the end. If you're a working mother, please try to find time (ha, ha!) to treat yourself to this book.
B000088E6D|1.0|I just want to know why would anyone want to listen to a dude whom we know is faking sing like Frank Sinatra. Frank S was horrible and I would rather be beaten then to listen to this c.d.. My roommate had this c.d. and it made me want to drink bleach. I can't understand why people actually go out and buy this .... Michael Buble should be given herpes in his throat for this mess. Michael Buble--Boooooo
B00005BL2A|5.0|this review is a couple of years late...but.<br />I remember not liking this album when it first came out, but I decided to see them on tour as well, as I have never seen them live.<br />Hearing Freelove live was amazing, especially in Detroit, where it was held outdoors under the stars. Amazing.<br />And on first listen of this album, I felt..\\"slow\\"...but if you listen to it more...its a very mature DM, or you can sense the evolution of the band, lyrically, from Black Celebration to Blasphemous Rumors to In My Shoes to Freelove the slowness seemed a reflection of the maturity of the band now... and if you saw them live for the Exciter Tour, you saw how they seem happy performing and to really be taking in all the love of the fans. (Black Celebration was AMAZING live!)<br />DM is one of those few bands I will enjoy and be faithful till my [last] day.
B00005JL78|5.0|Minority Report is one of the best science fiction films that I have seen in a very long time. Combining science fiction, murder and brilliant special effects, Steven Speilburg has told one of his greatest tales to date. <BR>Set in the year 2054, Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, who heads a special police unit called Pre-Crime. Using a trio of precognitives, who have the ability to see the future, paticularly, murder victims, Anderton and his crew have been able to prevent every murder for six years in the Washington D.C. area. This success has gained the attention of the nation, and the program is about to go to a national level. Anderton's life is looking up. <BR>Then everything goes downhill. A federal agent, played by Colin Farrell, comes to inspect the so called 'Perfect' system that Anderton is in charge of. Anderton's superior, Lamar Burgess, played by Max von Sydow, warns Anderton to be wary of the agent. Then the unthinkable happens: the Precogs see Anderton murdering a man. Anderton has never met the man, but soon will in the next 36 hrs. Believing that he is inoccent, he goes on the run, eluding his own teams and perfect system. Also believing that he was framed, Anderton goes to the scientist who created the precogs to find out if the visions could be faked. Instead, he finds that he might have a Minority Report, where a suspect might have an alternate future. From there, he must go back to the lion's den and 'download' the report from the precog that saw it. All the time, he is hunted by his own men, and suspects that there is more to his problems than murder. <BR>This story excelled on every level. From Anderton's characterization to the gritty world of 2054, this film presents a story that not only looks good, but makes you think about it. From the story that this movie was based on, I saw a huge improvement. The story is more human, emotional and interesting. <BR>Anderton's and Agatha's characterizations were both well done. Speilburg takes the time to set up Cruise's life, little by little, as as the movie progresses, we see why he's the way he is. We first see that he's a drug addict, then that he obsesses over his son and wife. It is later that we find that his son was kidnapped and killed, and his wife divorced him. Agatha's transformation goes from an object and police tool to a human who is a lot more complex than thought of. <BR>Speilburg's team succeded with the future world that they created as well. From the drug use, transportation, advertising, it presents a frighteningly real and believable feel to the film. Agmented by special effects, and we have a very real world. Given the research that went into the film, it is very possible that some of this will see reality. <BR>Finally, the plot. This raises the film above most science fiction movies,  both by it's complexity and grandur. Anderton sees himself murdering someone, but it is much more complicated. To prove his innocence, he has to dive into his own past, his beliefs in the system and solve a murder that was never seen by the precogs, and finally ending up finding a coverup that put him in the problem in the first place. Science aside, one can debate the ethics and theory in the film for a long time, making this film even more memorable. <BR>This movie is one of the best films of modern times, and will not fail to amaze and delight it's audience.
B000002UAR|5.0|When I first bought REVOLVER, on vinyl in the 70's, I was astonished.  A Beatles album with more songs by George Harrison than John Lennon???  I didn't realize then I was getting a truncated American version of what the band had assembled in England. Three of John's songs -- &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;, &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; and &quot;Dr Robert&quot; -- were plucked from the album and put on a collection called YESTERDAY AND TODAY -- that's the album with the notorious butcher cover.  The release of the Bealtes' library on CD finally gave us North American Beatlemaniacs the &quot;real&quot; REVOLVER -- and what a magnificent, groundbreaking achievement it was!  George's music matured here, with &quot;Taxman&quot; being one of his best and &quot;Love You Too&quot; representing his first (and best) excursion into full Indian instrumentation (although he'd played sitar on John's &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; on RUBBER SOUL).   Paul McCartney offers some of his best-ever compositions on this album.   &quot;For No One&quot; and &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; were exquisite -- and &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; remains a classic of its kind.  The soul-tinged &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot; was also first rate.  But as usual, the best, and most groundbreaking, offerings were from John.  &quot;And Your Bird&quot;, &quot;Dr Robert&quot; and &quot;She Said She Said&quot; are further livened up by some great Harrison guitar work -- he shines throughout the album.  And Lennon's closing track -- the mind-bending &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; -- is the summit to which the entire CD ascends.  A great way to finish this album (and to hint at what would come next year -- SGT PEPPER).   Maybe the best pop/rock album of all time.
B00008PW3O|5.0|This is one of my favorite Fleetwood Mac Cds and I'm a fan from the seventies!  Some people think 18 songs is too long - with this cd it's not long enough!  I love that this cd is more guitar oriented.  Stevie sounds great and her songs are awesome as usual. Of course, the musicianship of Mick, John, and Lindsey is outstanding...they are soooo underrated! Favorite songs from the cd are Destiny Rules, Miranda, Running Through the Garden, Thrown Down, Come, Peacekeeper.  This is a definite must have for any fan of Stevie, Lindsey, or Fleetwood Mac.
B000003TB6|5.0|When visiting the University of Wisconsin, Madison, a friend of mine came across this CD laying on the street.  He picked it up, put it in his CD player, and proceded to have one of the best listening experiences of his life.<br />This album is off the hook.  Fly, rad, chill, whatever the kids are saying these days... or should it be dayz?  The lyrics are insteresing and thought provoking, and the style is smooth, and relaxing.  Real instruments, not synthesizers, provide the mellow background beats that accompany the beautiful vocals.  Do You Want More?!!!?! features musicians and rappers whose stylings complement one another and have incredible chemistry.  It is rare to find an album that flows so well from track to track.<br />My favorite song by the Roots is Distortion to Static, but every other song on this CD is excellent.  Although Phrenology and Come Alive are more popular, this is my favorite Roots Album.  (Not to say that the others aren't good.)<br />Ideally you should listen to this album driving down the highway with your windows down in a warm, sunny day.  Pick this one up, its \\"essential.\\"
B000083E79|1.0|YES-I have waited my whole life for the very best of cher c.d. and now I can die in happiness. Right CHER--cher is old and stinky. She sounds like a dude with a barry white voice. I really don't have anything to say about cher. I'm just glad that she is stopping this board screeching music for once. Thank you god for old age or she would probably never stop. If there is one person that needs to have their voice-box removed it is cher. CHER--booo
B00008S2VG|5.0|After the final track ended, i said &quot;what?&quot; This album is stunning.  It is probably the most self reflective recording ever made where you as the listener actually feel her sentiments.  I guess some critics have to be negative, but one after I heard Nothing Fails and just got chills or even Nobody Knows Me and realized how much of our personality we hide for the sake of other's judgment, I think this is the best thing she's ever done.  This album has attitude, it has a message, it is cohesive, it is singable, it is emotional, it is fun, it is jaw dropping and eye opening and it is life.  Ask youself what are the most important things in life  and then go listen to this cd....this type of modern life is not for me, this type of modern life is not for free.....
B000084T18|5.0|To everyone who has been saying this CD is not good, please at least try and back up your arguments.  This CD has everything from hard war songs to the gangster lean songs.  If this CD is &quot;ruining rap&quot;  then you tell that to the millions of people who have already bought it.  I would be willing to bet money that you are not in the position to give this CD one star.  Stop trying to post &quot;unique&quot; reviews and repsect game.
B000008FIR|3.0|Fastway is former Mot&ouml;rhead guitarist Fast Eddie Clarke's band. The name is a result from the plans Fast Eddie Clarke had together with UFO's Pete Way to form a band together - FAST Eddie Clarke and Pete WAY. Well, the plan didn't work out for some reason but the name stayed.<br />\\"Waiting for the roar\\" is a decent follow up to Fastway's surprisingly good debut. The album was released in 1986 and is more radio friendly, but still a rocking effort. The opening \\"The world waits for you\\" is a melodic number starting off rather slow with a recycling guitar riff and a keyboard background. When it's time for the chorus, the drums are brought in and they sure sound time typical with the reverb or echo. Even the vocals have a decent amount of echo which contributes to the time typical feeling. In the up tempo \\"Kill me with your heart\\" the keyboards play a major role and this song reminds a bit of Journey or Night Ranger. The same goes for \\"Tired of your love\\" - very melodic and catchy. Even if the overall approach on this album is melodic pop-metal, it's not cheesy all the way; \\"Rock on\\" gives a slight touch of Led Zeppelin (at least on the verse) while \\"Waiting for the roar\\", \\"Girl\\" and \\"Back door man\\" are straight ahead rockers without any keyboards. Fastway are also doing a good version of Janis Joplin's \\"Move over\\", and have included an emotional ballad in \\"Change\\".
0345440900|1.0|Why is everyone so eager to find a way to make the baby sleep without rocking or carrying or singing or nursing??? I always thought that was exacatly how to get a baby to sleep! Why else did they invent lullabies? We family bed and plan to do so until daughter decides she wants her own space. Whether that's at 2, 3, or 7 or whatever. I guarantee she will not sleep with us \\"forever.\\" As for those who think family bed wrecks your sex life, well, you just aren't very creative, now, are you? Anyway, we believe that rocking or singing or carrying or nursing our baby to sleep and then sleeping with her are NOT \\"bad habits\\" as the author suggests but in fact are teaching her that relaxing and going to sleep are enjoyable, good things. Getting to sleep has always been a pleasant experience for her and that will mean good sleep habits through her life. Babies are COMPLETELY dependent creatures, why do people expect a little person who can't walk or talk or feed herself or go to the bathroom herself to be expected, even forced, to put herself to sleep? They are only dependent for such a relatively short time. Rocking my baby to sleep has been one of the greatest joys of my life, why would you want to miss that? Oh yeah, our baby has been sleeping through the night beautifully since six months (goes to bed at eight, gets up at seven). Before that, she only woke up once twice and then only to eat (very easy to nurse and go back to sleep when she is right beside you.)
B00008S2VH|5.0|The CD is a complete pleasant departure from her past two projects.<br />The production level on this CD is greatly toned down from the previous projects yet her grooves remain strong. Imagine a meeting between JEWEL & REM discussing politics and the current state of the world in a faded discotheque and you will get the texture and tone of this CD.<br />Madonna is a master at creating musical art. Her recent CD will grow on you ~ even if you have never been a fan.<br />Vocally, Madonna takes some risks on this CD, she tries to vocally return to a simpler presentation and style. Her vocals may remind you of a time during the mid 1980s when she wanted to be considered as MATERIAL & CONTROVERSIAL !<br />All in all ~ This CD is a musical success ! AMERICAN LIFE will give you a BANG for your buck !
B00007KQA3|3.0|A small but rising chorus of concerned voices in the U.S. suggest that in an age when we are eagerly surrendering our freedom for the illusion of more security, Big Brother may not be so far off.<br />1984, Michael Radford's adaptation of George Orwell's depressing premonition stars John Hurt and Suzanna Hamilton as lovers who must keep their affair a secret. Richard Burton, in his final role, is a government agent who exposes Hurt to the concept of resistance.<br />Oceania is a country that outlaws sex, fabricates reality and reconstructs history so it can suppress the masses, who are brainwashed via TV.<br />Sound familiar? Orwell was off a little on his dates, but some of his ideas have been boldly mirrored ... An almost great film that deserves to be reconsidered because of it's timely and relevant ideas.
6300273199|5.0|Let There Be Rock is the 1979 concert in Paris put on by the legendary rock band AC/DC with their original lead singer Bon Scott. The concert was in support of the album Highway To Hell and a year later Bon would be dead and AC/DC would have the biggest seller of there carear with Back In Black, but this one's about Bon.<BR>     The video is a blend of concert fottage and interviews with the band. <BR>     The set list includes some of the bands hits like Highway To Hell, Rocker, Sin City, and Whole Lotta Rosie. Watching this vid really puts you up close with the band and gives you an insight as to the inner workings.<BR>     The interviews and back stage fottage is a double edge sword becouse as usual Bon and Lead guitarist Angus Young give the bulk of the interviews. Some of the questions borderline on inane like &quot;Are you waiting for the third world war?&quot;, seem very foolish and forced but the movie has its moments of fun. The on stage fottage is fantastic and Bon comes off as both charming and affable. Angus and Malcolm Young (Angus's brother and backing guitar) along with Drummer Phill Rudd and Bassist Cliff Williams work in such perfect harmony with each other that it's not hard to see why AC/DC has such staying power.<BR>     By the end of the movie however you can't help but feel a little sad becouse after watching the movie you really feel that you got to know Bon well and knowing that he passed away a short time latter makes you feel for the loss suffered by not only the family and friends of Bon but by the music world all togeather.
B000001FDQ|3.0|This is the best and most innovating album by Yngwie Malmsteen, and in fact the only one you need. When this album first was released, it was a thrill and it really added something to the heavy metal genre. Ever since, Malmsteen has been most interesting in showing off as the fastest guitar slinger in the world, paying little attention to the overall quality of his songs - just focusing on those (in the long run) boring guitar solo's.
B000002C2E|2.0|It takes a fair bit of critical contortionism to declare this any kind of masterwork, especially considering it comes from a man with a few genuine classics under his belt. Despite popular opinion, Dylan's lyrics here are uniformly horrid, travelling the short distance between trite and awkward with less flourish than your garden-variety Hallmark card. Melodically the songs are indistinguishable from one another, with Dylan's cracked honk blending into the thick soup of Daniel Lanois' ponderous soundscape until it sounds like one of Brian Eno's ambient albums as mewled by a goat. I'd actually prefer the goat. Do Dylan a favor and pick up a copy of &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; or &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; or even &quot;Love and Theft&quot; instead of this over-praised steamer.
B000002LQR|5.0|Fairly or unfairly every RHCP release gets compared to this beast of an album. This is the album where everything came together for the boys and they became a house hold name. The bass was sick, drums banging, John's guitar playing was great, and Anthony was on point. Each song on this album is good. Sure there are better songs than others, but this is one of those albums you can just put on and listen to from start to finish. If you're new to RHCP music get this album before any of the others.
B000002AH7|4.0|There are already more than 70 reviews posted for this famous production, so I'll be brief: it's the kind of album one has to listen to attentively and repeatedly to learn to love. This is not the Miles of &quot;Kind of Blue.&quot; The joys here are indeed quiet, because melancholy and somber beauty dominates just about every track. The white arranger/conductor/composer Gil Evans, older than the black, gifted, moody Davis, had already collaborated with the trumpeter on two earlier records, but this was to be the most challenging of all. Up to 20 musicians joined in, yet Evans has restrained almost all of them to brilliant, fleeting moments in the limelight or to hushed but superbly rendered accents. Only one woman was on the project, the harpist, but the orchestra was a good mixture of black and white men. Evans and Davis created a memorable Spanish feel to all the moments. Yes, I think it is jazz, but as a listener, it feels like a long, sad symphony. I did not give it a fifth star simply because I personally missed having at least one uptempo tune to give the listener a short break from loneliness. I think the concept deserves six or seven stars, and the execution musically at least five. Certainly this is not the ideal item to start a Miles Davis collection, but it can't be left out of any collection of more than about 10 CD's of his. One has to be in the mood for it, and submerge one's ears in it, to get the genius of it. Definitely Miles dominates everything with his trumpet, which at times is a bit shrill for me (I'm a sax man, mainly) but he plays with such depth of emotion that even the non-fan will grant his talent. No wonder it is a landmark, albeit a controversial one. For sure, it is a jazz record that classical music fans might appreciate more than anyone else.
B00008H2LE|1.0|Well, what can I say. They told MTV they knew rap rock is dead and yet they make another rap cd. I had high hopes for this because of what they had stated, but this CD is far worse then I ever thought. I never thought they would get rid of what made their songs good, the singer. Hes still there but he only handles the chours while that spikey haired reject raps out anything that could be meaningful if it was being sung. It's really sad when a band doesn't make music they want but instead follows a trend, or whats popular at the moment. These guys truly are Backstreet Boys with guitars. If they would just let the singer (his name escapes me)do all the voice work and actually sing, this this band would be amazing, but until they realize that this CD can't be thought of as a justifable purchace. Unless you like 50 cent :P
B00008J2DQ|5.0|You thought you'd never see the day when a rock/metal band fronted by Sully Erna would ever make it to the top.  Well, things have changed, their new release &quot;Faceless&quot; has proven to the world that they could do it.  Ever since  their first hit off the cd &quot;Straight Out of Line&quot; came out, people everywhere have been requesting Godsmack.  Also, with the help of having their song, &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; on the Scorpion King Soundtrack(also on Faceless), their faces have been everywhere.  With Sully's strong vocals, Robbie's intense bass playing, Tony's electrifying guitar riffs, and new comer Shannon as their awesome drummer, that's what makes this the best cd to hit stores in years.  The whole thing begins with Sully expressing himself with &quot;Straight Out of Line.&quot;  Lasting through out the whole thing, you can feel what the lyrics are saying.  Then ending with the rhythmic beating of the tribal drums in &quot;Serenity.&quot;  This has by far been their best release in years.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol... what can I say?<br />People are saying they are the new Joy Division - fair enough, they do sound like them.  I originally thought the guitars sounded like the original Joy Division guitars, but having seen them live - they actually use the exact same guitars as the Beatles (another of my fave bands who I haven't listened to for a while).  Anyway, years ago my mate told me that Joy Division were influenced by Lou Reed in a big way - I didn't hear it in them at all.  Interpol however, sound like Joy Divisions predocessors - as the singer sounds smack in-between Lou Reed and Ian Curtis.  Having listened to Interpol - I can hear the lou Reed in Ian's voice.  I advise anybody to listen to a Lou Reed track (viscious, or something), an Interpol track (Obstacle1, Say hello to the angels, or something), then something by Joy Division (Transmission, She's lost control), in that order,  then try them in different orders - you'll see what I mean! - they all follow on nicely in terms of style
B00005MKA1|5.0|I know thats a pretty big statement but this album is simply a joy to listen to. Time Will Tell is the highlight of the album for me but every song is really good. I don't think its possible to listen to this album and not feel a little bit better afterwards. To steal a quote I read once \\"While Bob Marley was signing the world was getting better\\" I truly believe that and this album shows it. Not as political as his other work, but the message of unity and love is still there.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Does anyone remember the good old days of Star Trek movies?  I mean the good ones 2,3,4,6, Generations, and First Contact.  Good movies.  Entertaining movies that would keep you in your seat for however long the movie was.  What the hell happend?  The last two movies have been disappointing to say the least.  But I'm only going to complain about this one.  Odds are if you are on line looking at this movie to see when it comes out, you have already seen it, so I wont go into the plot.  My question to people who saw this movie, and all the other Trek films is, did it seem like they were stealing ideas from other Trek films?  <BR>For example the dramatic battle at the end, where the Enterprise is fighting a cloaked ship.  Did that remind anyone of Star Trek 6?  Or when Riker kicks the guy off of the bridge because the bad guy has a hold of Riker's foot(Star Trek 3).  If you say, I have had enough of you (also Star Trek 3) while he is kicking, it fits perfectly.  Now the big one.  Data dies to save the crew of the Enterprise from a horrible death.  That should remind people of SPOCK!  And then, it looks like he could come back, because B-4 (the mentally ill robot) sings Blue Skies (which is the song Data sang at the wedding of Troy and Riker) it seems very similar to Star Trek 2, because it leaves you with hope.  Mr. Berman if you read this, please do something orriginal next time.  Oh by the way, I saw it three times.
B00006879E|5.0|I am very impressed with this album.  The album has a unique blend of genres (rock, pop, funk, R&amp;B) and the vocalists compliment each other very nicely.  I enjoyed hearing their drummer as one of their lead vocalists.  For an old-timer, enjoying some funky beats and a little soul, this album is one of my favorites.  All of the tracks on this album are excellent.  I hope to see and hear future work from this talented band.
B00005JLT5|1.0|I didn't enjoy it yes it was well made but it is very overhyped and isn't anything to rave about , Not really worth your time unless you love long dull films.
B00000J7JO|3.0|This is a pretty good album. Peppers came back and showed they still had it. John came back from his battles with addiction and showed everyone why he's considered a great guitar player. Overall though this album isn't up to BSSM, so it gets 3.5 stars. Its unfair but I can't help comparing the two.
