0691152640|3.0|This book was not what I expected it to be.  It read like an academic paper, although it was well written and very accessible.  Rather than being filled with profound insights and deep analyses of big financial problem, it regurgitated well know economic facts but backed them up with loads of empirical data.  Now, I don't know about you, but I am not interested in looking at 200+ pages of tables that detail every single piece of data on every single financial crisis ever recorded.  While this data is necessary to develop economic models and theories, it does not make for an interesting book for a general audience.  The insights (some of which were truly interesting) of this book could have been summarized in about 20 pages (indeed, there are only about 150 pages of actual text in the book, so despite it looking massive, I breezed through it).<br /><br />While the book discussed the common causes of financial crises, it did not examine specific crises in detail, save for the U.S. subprime crisis.  There are some financial crises that are considered watershed moments in history, and I was hoping those could be explored in depth.  Instead, we get absurdly tiny summaries for each crisis, such as \\"X country defaulted on XX% of its external debt in 19XX\\" without any additional context or analysis.  As there have been hundreds of such crises, we get hundreds of single sentence summaries of virtually every crisis in history that mean absolutely nothing to the reader.<br /><br />I did not appreciate this macro-macro analysis.  None of this would have been a problem if I didn't feel like the book was marketed as being a magnum opus tour through the history of financial crises, because then I wouldn't have bought it.  It is a boring, academic read that repeats itself, is unnecessarily protracted, and has few original insights considering its gargantuan size.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book!!! A beautiful love story with all the twists of a great thriller. Nicholas Sparks has written another masterpiece!
B008VBYN80|4.0|I wonder if you can get a diamond hack and get a lot but they got that for the android phone it's on youtube it's not fair
B00594MB2M|5.0|First off, I will admit right away I am totally obsessed with France in general and Paris in particular so I am partial that way.  However putting that aside, I still give this movie five stars.  Of course, I loved the atmosphere and seeing Paris, getting a feel of everyday life in Paris.  Beyond that though is the message.  The ending tied the whole movie together and at least to me I felt strongly about the importance of appreciating every precious moment of your life.  That being said the movie itself is not without flaws; it lags in parts a bit and the characters never truly develop so individually I never got into any of them.  As a whole though the main thrust of the movie rang true.  And the scenery and feel of Paris itself was already worth every cent to me.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I first saw this miniseries on the History Channel and I immediately fell in love. But now that I have the DVD box set I can watch it whenever I want, not to mention it's nice to have another addition to my collection. Best TV show ever.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Good graphic and definitely challenging but was over all too quickly. Wish it would have had more challenges or chapters.
0307719774|5.0|I love the idea of this book! The questions vary between being simple, like &#34;what is your hairstyle?&#34; to much deeper, more thoughtful questions that will have you thinking a little. It's going to be great looking back on this once I'm out of college! I'm going to buy one for my friend for her birthday, as well!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Well Fringe is my favorite show ever so you can imagine that it would get the highest rating from me. It combines sci-fi with character development and great plot with fine acting.I suspect that had it been on one of the big three networks it would have been a huge ratings hit.It was obviously well planned out from the beginning and the final season didn't disappoint.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Love this game but it almost feels like it forces you to buy star's and when you do get some it's way to easy to lose them on accident.I just want to play not pay.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|I have enjoyed this game.  I have never really enjoyed tilt control games in the past, but this one does it right.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games EVER!!! It is really, really, fun and addictive... so it is one of the best apps ever. Please get this if you love Temple Run. It is mainly just that with a world tour touch. Where you travel to different areas of the world. So, get it now.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found this book to be a great read....  The thought behind the main plot was really intriguing and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing.  Would make an awesome movie!!!
1451695195|5.0|interesting to prove it is not a brain phenomanon that occurs when near death does very well at pointing that out.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Fun to play when you're bored. Once you start you can't put it down. Graphics are simple but clear. Looks great on.my kindle fire hd. Easy for kids and adults.
0811870413|5.0|This book has way more than I could have ever imagined. such a great buy for any Baker, professional or hobby.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie is amazing. Every teenager should watch this and perhaps learn from this. One of the best films I have seen in my lifetime. Wonderful movie!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's hard to buy things because they are trying to make money off the app but over app really good graphics and everything. This might be my new addiction.
B0027MJU00|5.0|It is a dark novel, indeed.  Character development is thoughtful and consistent.  The mystery holds all through. The book.  Who done it.  Read this book. You will be surprised at the end.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Somehow I missed seeing this series when it originally appeared on television.  Thanks to Amazon Prime's instant video feature, I have been able to catch up on one of the most interesting series I have ever viewed.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game, I got it for my little girl and my older girl they are 4 years old and 9 years old. They are never of my kindle fire now they love this game!!!!!! They also love a game called my horse which I would recommend if your child likes this game. I would give it five stars because now I can watch football in price!!!!!!!!!
B003XKDEX4|5.0|If you love Vivaldi like I do, you won't be disappointed. The price is great! It works out about $1.10 per CD. Can't be beat. The music is great. The sound is great. I am not a musicologist like the other two reviewers here. I loved all the CDs - even the Recorder Concertos. There are really no bad music here. Vivaldi was and is a genius. He is a lot more than the 'Four Seasons' that everyone knows by him. There are great surprises here musically. The box is no frill with no liner notes/booklet or anything which is a bloody shame. I would have liked to learn a little bit more about all the pieces but hey for $50 you get 40 CDs! Relax and enjoy and be happy to be alive to hear this wonderful music from the heavens.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me drawn in from page one. I loved it! Definitely a new favorite, a must read! :)
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I love reading MURDER mysteries and this one combined romance and family with it which made it very enjoyable reading.  This is my first book by this author, however not my last.  Thank you.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Once I had read the previous book by Follett, I had to read this one. The continuance of the same characters made it even better.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not as good as some of her older books, just repeating the same old stuff about her and all the characters.  Thought is was boring.  Just didn't hold my interest.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved the history mixed with fiction. Once I was reading, I found it hard to put the book down. Loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played!!! You never get tired of it and its super fun to compete with your friends and compare scores!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I never saw this program before and was drawn by the mystique surrounding it.  I very much enjoyed season 1 and am continueing with season 2.  The series reminds me of the origninal Star Trek; some world saving along with quirky nuances.  Very entertaining!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I enjoyed the songs.  The Greatest Hits collection was relaxing.  This was the first time I had purchased Kelly Clarkson's music.
0307720950|5.0|Chris Anderson make with this book an amazing and inspirational must for anyone who is interested in the DIY and maker movements. The book takes you in a lot of examples were the 3D printer is going to be the next big thing ins this movements for the personal and small batches manufacture. The democratization of the manufacturing tools is going to be critical for the new industrial revolution and according to Anderson, that future is here.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It was an amazing game but then I assent on it for a few days and now it freezes when ever I die! Not happy about it either.....
B004UID2LC|5.0|FREE di You TUBE DOWNLOADER APP : Very easy to use, I can understand how to function with a good selection of videos,music, and much more.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this book. It was a great read well worth your time anyone who likes a good story that's well written will love it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a blast! I always have fun playing it! And I love it! You should really get it! There is always something to do!
0987300911|5.0|It is well explained and easy to understand.  Value for money and a good buy to enhance the knowledge about the language.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun and addicting. my favorite thing about it is that it has many levels from easy to hardest. I like that it has different size boards that you can play on. I like the Colorado of the balls.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Although I am not a baseball fan, I found the content of this movie to be interesting as it showed how the overly ambitious  of today's society will cast aside the veterans  to get themselves ahead to the demise of the organization they work for.
B00B769XB8|1.0|es mucho tiempo esperando sin respuesta adecuada, lamentable y totalmente falto de seriedad.<br />Si no tiene feche estimada, no lo pongan en venta anticipada.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game. It's fun and keeps me busy. My kids love it too. I'm very happy that I found it.
B0058YPILY|5.0|The same great cast, writing and action I expect from CM! Season 7 delivers with all the twists and turns fans have come to expect znd love over the years. Five stars!!!
B00A8KJN14|2.0|Great work went into making this movie, it looks great, but there is something missing...If you watch the live-action short from 1984 (included in the extras), it has heart, humor and a low-budget charm that is infectious. But the longer stop-motion version lacks the same appeal, and is strangely disturbing, mostly during all the animal deaths - at least to this viewer. I loved Corpse Bride and Ed Wood, two much better offerings.
1250006341|5.0|This was a gift for my mother. While it is very interesting and a beautiful book she was expecting it. to be a story. However, she is enjoying.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|very happy with the time that I received the movie as well as the quality.  I'm sure I'll be doing business with goHastings.
030758836X|2.0|Not overly impressed.... tends to drag things out... also kind of trashy that Nick has a mistress.  Why is 'amazing amy' giving him the cold shoulder as she is unaware of his infidelity?  Still in the middle of the book, so hoping it gets better, but tough trying to stay interested...taking way too long to build on the plot.  Wish they all wrote like John Grisham!!
B004S5C8WG|5.0|One can believe this story -  how easily it could happen.  Most of Jeffrey Archer's book are like that -  have always enjoyed them.
0446547573|5.0|Nicholas Sparks delivers again! Wonderful book with a great message! I would not recommend for younger readers, as the story line can be a little dark at times.
B0051GY0LS|5.0|Have read almost book Grisham has written -  always enjoy them.  Good characters - good story line, holds your interest
0756404746|5.0|The Name of the Wind is the story of a legendary man called Kvothe. He is many things, a wizard, a hero, an assassin of a King, for a while very deeply regarded, but for more time, hated.<br /><br />From the first pages of the book we learn that Kvothe is a man of legendary deeds. There are consequences of his action in the world, random people are talking about him and tell stories. But they talk about the world as well. Something went wrong in that world, and Kvothe tells with his own words that it's his fault.<br /><br />This is that story.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, He somewhat unwillingly agrees to tell the story of his life, and I mean his LIFE. We start from the very beginning, from his childhood and move forward. This is where the spell of this book lays. You get connected with Kvothe, how innocent and how pure he was, and then you go with him all the troubles of his life. The writing draws you inside the book, and I am sure you can not take it out of your head even when you put the book down. It's a long book, but very enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are looking for a new book to start, try this one. You won't regret it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|challenging enough to make it fun, but not so much that it kicks my butt!  I really enjoy this app.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|i chose this rating because the movie was entertaining and very funny and i would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I just bought the app and ot wont open. I could have easily bought a different app if I knew this was going to happen<br />_
B00BHMETKC|4.0|From start to finish, Argo has you at the edge of your seat, even if you know your history. The drama is intense, and the acting puts the viewer into the time and situation of the characters.  Had some buffering issues, but overall, a good movie experience.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Beautiful, heart wrenching story.  Jodi Picoult is fantastic.  The way she develops both the characters and the plot is masterful.
0792163710|5.0|Love this western. It is one of the first &#34;adult&#34; westerns. Does anyone else see the similarities between this and Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider?
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Actors were mis-cast in practically every role. The movie does bring forward challenging questions, but most plot elements are too unclear to follow, let alone understand.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Kept my attention for the entire 2 hours even though I knew the story. Very well done, I can see why this is winning awards.
B007EW9ISM|3.0|The stylus works well, but it almost seems as if I am writing with a giant sharpie marker. Same build, but at half the thickness and we would have a 5 star product.
B0099G3I96|5.0|You really can't go wrong with any No Doubt purchase and this album has been awesome from the first song, to the last.
B002APU580|4.0|While not perfect, it was a well-done adaptation.  I am a purist, so I am never pleased by having bits left out or changed.<br /><br />I did not like the foppish, stupid appearance of Bingly, but I did think that the choices for Elizabeth, Darcy and Wickham were excellent.  Mr and Mrs Bennett were entirely too old (as is so often the case in Pride and Prejudice adaptations) but were wonderful actors.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable movie, and I do recommend it, while I still found it flawed.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I get music fairly regularly from Amazon and my brother turned me on to Lana Del Rey. I must say, I've been really impressed with her music. I like the sultry-ness of her voice and the tame sounds. Very reminiscent of Adele.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This is a deceptively simple, yet clever game. It is hard to explain, but it mainly consists of trying to combine elements to create new things. It sounds silly and uninteresting but it is excellent. It requires some thought and becomes extremely engrossing. I liked it so much that I bought the full version.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This type of music is right up my alley and I get music from artists I've never heard of regularly on here just because I enjoy one song. This entire album is excellent!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|The show itself, stellar through seasons one and two were,  has declined in series three.  While the acting remains superb, the plots are less interesting and less well written.  I was impatient for series three to begin.  After watching it, I have no interest in whether or not there will be a fourth.<br /><br />The DVD itself is well designed and produced.  I have no fault to find with its quality.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This album surpassed my expectations. I listen to the entire thing on repeat in my car for weeks on end. The soul behind their voices really gets me going when I hear it. I love it!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Not much need to review the show, by now, I am sure.  It is an engaging family drama taking place on a fictional Yorkshire country estate, with seasons one and two covering the years 1912-1920.  The acting is excellent, and for the most part the episodes are excellently written.<br /><br />This particular set is well produced, with high quality discs and packaging.  I recommend it for those who enjoyed the show and would like to have a permanent copy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an amazing game, I have played since I bought it and never have stopped... it also does not a delay on running or jumping
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is by far the best FM Wireless Transmitter that I have ever owned.<br /><br />I use this product while driving around the NYC and so far, no static whatsoever in the tri-state area.<br /><br />I've used so many different products from other vendors such as Belkin, etc, but all of those products produced too much static. I even tried to open up one of such transmitters to extend the antenna, etc but I finally decided to buy slightly expensive FM transmitter based on the reviews from other Amazon.com members, and I am so glad that I pulled the trigger on this gem.<br /><br />1) Plug and play. No button to activate the transmission<br />2) Use it with AUX cable that comes with the product to play Pandora radio and MP3 from iPhone 4S. It works perfectly as it should<br />3) Device is smaller than I thought. I also use the USB drive slot to charge my iPhone while using the product<br /><br />Overall, I will buy this item again
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is the best game ever I am very addicted Awesome. My cousin and I love this game..........!!!!!!  :) I LOVE it
B0051MKMNC|1.0|I just tried to download the digital copy for my disc and it won't download.  I turned the disc over and sure enough there are manufacturing defects in the disc.  You can see where the burning process skipped in several areas.  Very embarrassing for Amazon and the company that they used to sell it.  Unfortunately it is past the time for me to exchange it.  Please help Amazon if you see this.
B00068TJM6|5.0|This a very good quality watch for the price. I guess watches are unfashionable with the advent of smart phones.<br /><br />It does not feel cheap. It's got good weight and the chrome loos awesome.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I absolutly loved this book. Well written, easy to read and wonderful characters. Tells another side to the horrible war and how honest to goodness people survived harrowing times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book series an the second one is one of my favorites. A must read book for all ages.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Engaging, realistic; I fell in love with this book. A definite must read for an insight on history and childhood abroad....
B0009PAVI2|5.0|Filters kept ending up in shirt pockets, or in ziplock bags, or wrapped in lens cleaner Cloths. None of those protected the glass. This does, and it allows me to keep both the 8 stop nd, and polarizer with me, and have a spare spot.<br /><br />The product is quality, and the partitions are strong enough that I don't have to worry about something in my trunk scratching or puncturing the glass. In addition to the padding, the way that the cloth folds, while making it a bit more bulky, the outer folds also further protect the optics from dropping.
B003M70O5O|4.0|Can't say that this series is not interesting. Keeps you guessing as to who really are the good guys and bad guys.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Thought the book was informative, inciteful and done very well.  Loved that it was written from the perspective of Alice who  is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer.  Truly shows how awful this disease is and how it affects everyone in the family.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Season 2 continues to be great story telling. However this series is not for everyone. Quite violent. Show walks a very fine line.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I originally started this series because I figured at about 5000 pages It would be a long while before I finished and had to say goodbye to the characters... how wrong I was. They  kill and introduce 20 new characters every 100 pages. Not super happy that the page count stops at 694 pages, maybe kindle can work on that. Wouldn't have gotten through it without the \\"x-ray\\" feature on my kindle, that shows where the character has been throughout the books. Helps to not miss those \\"aha moments\\" because you are so bogged down in details and other characters. The series on HBO also helps clear up the sea of bearded knights I can't keep straight...on to book 5!<br />I did really like it , but it certainly isn't a quick, lite read.  *spoiler*.  I have to say after the red wedding I was put off it for awhile, and read a few other books before going back to it. I do really enjoy the series, it just isn't something you can read without giving it your full attention.
B0010V4S2O|1.0|I was disappointed it did not make clear that it would not work on US DVD player.  Too expensive to send back.
0143119680|5.0|This book was shipped in great condition. So for a paperback, I must admit, I am surprised.  I am currently reading this now so I modify my review soon. So far its about this Scholarly (non magic using) witch named Diana. She discovers the Ashmole 782 buried in the library stacks.  This tome tells witches, daemons, and vampires all about their place in the magical universe.  It is said to be a powerful tome. Diana feels as much just touching the book.  And now she has drawn the constant attention of every magical being on campus.  Especially Professor Matthew Clairmont (vampire). As the two journey together, they fall deeper in love.  I am new to this genre so this should be fun. Usually I am a historical romance, or erotica woman. Here's to new and exciting territory.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the show......so sad it's over for this year.  If you enjoy period pieces, you'll really enjoy this series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game to pass the time on the plane or while waiting for an appointment<br />I would recommend it to anyone
B001CN2WXM|5.0|A well-deserved Oscar for best picture, and one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in the last 20 years.  If you like a movie that grabs you in the beginning, challenges your observation and interest throughout, and does't get stupid at the end, you'll enjoy this film.  Great acting across the board.  Read the book after you see the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much.  Me and my sisters think its the most awesome game in the world.Its just amazing.
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|A very nice collection for someone who appreciates her voice and interpretations, but doesn't need everything she ever recorded.  Good price as well.
B001B51B9M|5.0|not sure if this was shirley jones last musical, but she was outstanding.  It was a kick seeing Ron Howard at such a young age as well.  My father's family is from Mason City, and I visited the Music Man Museum there a couple of years ago.  The Music Man has always been a family favorite, and it is great to own the Blu Ray DVD.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|LONESIME DOVE IS THE BEST WESTERN I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT FOLLOWS THE BOOK VERY CLOSELY. ANYTHING WITH ROBERT DUVAL HAS TO BE REAL THE ENTIRE CAST IS GREAT.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app. I wanted to clean my Kindle Fire & this does a good job. It removed a couple app from my kindle, that was cool. But it doesn't do it now, so I need to see if there another version. Get it! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is quote from my 5 year old \\"it is a really fun game and I like to play it I am better than my daddy\\"
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun!  7 yr old daughter takes real riding lessons and loves this game.  the realism is great too.  the minigames keep the fun going.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hope there is more to come, what an awesome series! Loved the beautiful dresses and the amazing castle scenes.
0307341577|3.0|Dark Places was gripping and held my attention to the end despite the jumps back and forth between time and among characters, which at times was distracting.  However, the major problem I thought was how articulate the damaged heroine was.  Libby, who'd witnessed the brutal destruction of her family, suffered physical and emotional trauma, lived from hand to mouth with her behavior disorders as a result, spoke with unusually well educated language and seemed gifted and talently descriptive when it came to the English language.  Her apt similies and vocabulary did not strike me as credulous.  I think Ms. Flynn would have served the character better by using the third person.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been reading a lot of so so good to mediocre books on my kindle lately...and was really surprised to see how good this book is!!!!  If your on the fence about reading this book, thinking a silo story doesn't sound very entertaining, don't be!  This book is very good and you won't be able to put it down.  Out of about 30 books I've read on my kindle so far, this one is by far the best!  I've just bought the prequel omnibus....hoping the author writes some sequels a well.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I'm mostly a dog lover and I truly believe in the connection you feel to your dog. I loved how this story was told from the dogs perspective. This book made me laugh and cry and hug my own dogs while I wondered if they also wished they had opposable thumbs.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Every night the wind and rain. I'm out for the count. Wonderful timing setting available. Also great deep sleep setting.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Omg!it was so amazing!I love this book.I want to watch the movie now.other were time that I cried the Times I laughed so hard
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a terrific program full of people you love to love, people you love to hate, and the backdrop of the British aristocary that we Americans secretly enjoy seeing.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|This is one of our all time favorite Disney movies.<br />Great story, great soundtrack, and really funny.<br />Highly recommended for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg! My 3 year old loves this game !!!!! The music in background is so cute to ,!!! APPROVED in my book ;)
B0018QQQK8|2.0|This book made me throw up in my mouth a little bit several times. Don't we all wish we could be perfect like Logan and Beth? Yeah right.
0887431453|4.0|I bought this for my 3 year old because he wants to &#34;do school&#34; like his big brother.  He was able to do maybe a third of the book.  The other 2 thirds are perfect for my 5 year old pre-schooler, so he does those sections.
B009UZBLSG|2.0|Product would have been nice but it only worked with my computer monitor and not my mid 2000's Panasonic plasma regardless of what HDMI i paired with the TV and Slimport. Also there is next to 0 support or information that comes with the product or on the website. Again, would be a great product if it worked for me but it didn't.. returned
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Ha sa lot of the &#34;spyish&#34; feel of the original bond movies, good crazed villain, good balance of story background and action.  That said it seems a bit long, almost as if some of the final plot twists might have been added after the fact to celebrate the 50th anniversary and introduce new characters while saying farewell to old ones.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Good partner for financial professionals, I am satisfied, easy to operate, good leather case. worth for the money i spent
B003V1WTMM|4.0|The writer's style is outstanding, as always.  The story ending was really sad though.  Don't want to give away too much, but it is a good read!
B003QTUQGU|4.0|My wife didn't like it, but I found it entertaining and the special effects to create the underground world were great. Its worth watching, but is not an exceptional movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was an easy read and entertaining.  However, I thought there was too much change to the main character's personality almost to fit the plot.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|This movie rocks!!! I won't let any one touch this movie unless I am around, lol! Amazon made my weekend by shipping this and my soundtrack to it very fast...this movie has become a regular on my night as it is loved by my nephews and my niece :)
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Lucy Liu makes the show wonderful. She is wonderful and gives the show balance. She should have a stronger part
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My review is a lot briefer than usual because so much has already been covered in other reviews. Over 400 reviewers have given the 6 DVD set 5 stars count me in too. This a 9 hour DVD set on a scale with Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. It has won 8 Emmy awards including outstanding miniseries. For the history enthusiasts and the military aficionados out there this DVD set has your name on it just go out and purchase it.
B00004VVND|5.0|Another great great sci fi movie to have in your collecton. I love the action of this movie this is still a classic a must buy
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I watch horror movies all the time; they tend to run the gambit of good and bad.  Sometimes the bad can be funny enough that they become good.  This movie plays it pretty straight (as it is essentially a bigger budget mass market horror movie).  Not truly a horror movie but a thriller with horror elements would be a better definition.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a movie that relies on \\"found footage\\" to the extent that the main character is essentially discovering the truth by watching movies he found in the attic of the house.  The \\"bad guy\\" (baghuul) isn't really omnipresent throughout the movie, more or less this is a character driven horror movie with the bad guy being a \\"spectre\\" in the background (there but rarely shown or presence only shown through the aftermath of events).<br /><br />It's a great movie and fairly disturbing as far as these mass market movies go...not the movie itself but the home videos the guy is watching are very disturbing; I mean it basically shows murders and because of the way they're shot these murders look believable and real.  If they had cast the wife as a better actress (you know...one that doesn't have an unbelievably bad accent and can actually act) then the movie would've been far better.  Whenever she comes on screen she just hamm's up a movie that shouldn't have any hamm; overly dramatic bad acting from the woman that doesn't match the situation(s).<br /><br />Otherwise good movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a terrific read.  I love book where I don't have to figure out who the characters are, matching up names with personalities.  In this book, it's mainly two characters.  It was a great romance without the smut.  I will definitely seek out this author again!
B00APUTEBG|2.0|Usually it's \\"big dumb ugly\\" but obviously this crud fest jason bourne wannabe didn't have much of a budget and bruce willis couldn't be bothered to stick around for the whole movie.<br /><br />So...anyway you've got the standard \\"my father is a spy!\\" storyline and \\"eegads!  Double cross!\\" for some dumb reason.  Roving israeli death squads (that are incredibly incompetent and apparently immortal).  Hamfisted automotive product placement with fake physics.  Horrible editing (I believe the car chase repeated footage at least twice...this ain't a 70s B movie).  Snooze-tacular ending.  Oh and there's some bizarre sexual innuendo/chemistry going on between the two main characters even though they're essentially brother and sister (from another mother)...that's nasty.<br /><br />I mean if it were meant to be funny, I might've laughed but I just sat there watching it scratching my head.  Real bad but watchable if you can ignore the infuriating things, I suppose.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how easy it is to use. The numbers are big enough for older hands. And anything free is wonderful.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Fun time waster...and a challenge to improve your score each time in the puzzle mode. Wish you could see the results at the end of the game. But, the opaque overlay somewhat blurs the scores.

0061777269|4.0|Dr. Pim van Lommel's  Consciousness Beyond Life seemed to be two books in one. What seemed to me to be the first part, chapters 1 through 10, deals exclusively with Near Death Experiences (henceforth NDE).  Lommel does an excellent job of relating all the aspects of NDEs and demonstrates why many of them cannot be accounted for by any naturalistic hypothesis. What's most important and unique to Lommel's book is his own Dutch study of NDEs that spanned almost a decade. Lommel provides accounts of numerous NDEs that contained veridical evidence. In fact, this book is worth the money just to simply read some of these amazing stories. Also important is that Lommel's study was prospective and therefore had a control (patients who went into cardiac arrest and did not have a NDE). This prospective study demonstrates that neither physiological, psychological nor pharmacological explanations could have played a factor in the NDEs. Lommel also brings forth the statistics of his study and demonstrates that NDEs are found across people with varying beliefs, backgrounds, religions, social status etc. and shows that there is no difference between patients who experienced an NDE and ones who did not.<br /><br />Another important aspect of Lommel's book is his discussion of why no type of brain activity can account for an NDE. He demonstrates that consciousness is dependent on the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and communication between the hippocampus and thalamus and that these are the first parts of the brain to go during a cardiac arrest. Thus, many \\"skeptic\\" explanations such as oxygen deficiency, chemical reactions in the brain, and electrical activity in the brain are unwarranted and cannot account for experiences during an NDE.<br /><br />What I take to be the second part of this book, chapters 11 through 16, are quite scientifically advanced and, surprisingly, less concrete. Lommel utilizes current Quantum Theory (e.g, nonlocality, entanglement) to outline and defend a widely-known, but not widely-held, theory which he calls nonlocal consciousness. I will not expand the theory here since I have neither the space nor the nonlocal consciousness to do so (insert laughter here) but I will say that this theory entails that matter is contingent on a sort of other-dimensional omnipresent consciousness. The problem I had with this section is that it went a little over my head. However, what I did understand seemed fascinating and shocking (in a good fashion). Lommel's theory, unfortunately, is too conjectural for now anyway. But he should be commended for his unique theory and only time will tell if it's warranted.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic book. Even if one is not enlightened to all the science in it one will inevitably benefit from the first part on NDEs. I recommend this book to all interested in NDEs or the current debates regarding the genesis and nature of consciousness.y-known, but not widely-held, theory which he calls nonlocal consciousness.

B005IA9JZO|5.0|I already owned the DVD, and just bought this as part of my effort to upgrade my video library to Blu-ray quality.
B0050IY61G|5.0|Many people reading this book will be on pathway to self discovery, filled with epiphanies and profound moments of clarity recalling otherwise inexplicable moments in their life or the lives of their loved ones. It is fortunate that something which will be so deeply impactful is also so comprehensive and well written.<br />Dr. Attwood has struck the perfect balance between reference material and personal narrative of his patients' histories, touching upon every facet of life as an aspie. It has attained the well deserved reputation as the bible of the AS community.<br />My kindle edition is full of highlights and personal notes, I will return to this read numerous times throughout my life.
B00865P3AS|5.0|As if I couldn't love these 2 amazing cello players, this album came out and I love them even more. Sulic & Hauser are so entertaining you can feel their passion in the music.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|This was a gift for my husband, a longtime Zeppelin enthusiast who had no idea this had been released. The first package contained a broken CD. Amazon handled the exchange promptly, providing an intact set of discs the second time. My husband is loving the music and the videos.
B000I2J2WM|5.0|A classic Movie showing much older cars than Le Mans with Steve McQueen. Nice to see these old movies again
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozer – When I received my Kindle I loaded a bunch of free games.  I love this one.  It reminds me of the arcade game and it’s addicting.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Challenging enough on getting the three star level ratings, only wish there was some kind of an achievement or cut scene for getting three stars on every level. Hours of solid fun to get the perfect score but still  easy enough to complete on one star so you don't get too frustrated.  Progressively harder puzzles.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|For thirty years my favorite live album has been \\"Delaney and Bonnie On Tour With Eric Clapton\\" by Delaney and Bonnie.  Not anymore.<br /><br />I'm at a complete loss how to describe this album by Tedeschi Trucks Band.  If I lived for 200 years I would never find the words to say how incredible this is.<br /><br />Hours of fantastic music, by superb musicians.  Just outstanding.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I love that I am pulled into the story from the first paragraph. He is one of the best authors I have encountered.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Some answered, some remain.  I would love to have a one on one conversation with this author.  Many people have had near death experiences but the time and depth of his experience coupled with his background as a physician add authority to his story.  What does this say about when to remove someone from life support?
B007EE4XKI|3.0|good book, good writer... only one moment where he used some material from a movie I had already seen, which let me down because it was all pretty good = ).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I told my friends to read this very good book. I saw the movie as soon as I could with my friends.
B000WCDI64|4.0|I love Amy Winehouses sound and music. I just hated seeing the alcohol at work on this dvd.  Not the best performance from her.  But she still one of my favorite artist's.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love the game very well would highly recommend buying the grand daughter s love helping me play the game it's fantastic
B009P5K4HK|5.0|I just love this Dvd! Amy's music and voice just get to me.. in a good way.  This Dvds sound is awesome and clear and crisp.  I loved the interviews in between the songs and the one with Amy in a nonalcohol indused state is perfect.  And the fact that it was recorded in a smaller setting really makes a difference.  All of it.... perfect! For Amy Winehouse fans.. soooo worth the money spent.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|After the game of chess that was 'The Dark Knight', this bloated, corny, and plain idiotic movie slaps you in the face with how hard it sucks. While nothing could be as campy as Tim Burton's take on Batman, this movie certainly gives 'The Phantom Menace' a run for its money as the biggest franchise flop in recent memory. The 5-star reviews here can only be from teenage boys and/or franchise groupies who uncritically gobble down any output squeezed out by money-grubbing studios.<br /><br />The problems with this mess of a movie are endless. Mainly, it's just boring and completely unbelievable...and way too long. There's not nearly enough Batman and, when he is onscreen, he mostly gets his ass kicked. Meanwhile the villians are capable of doing everything successfully. As a result, Batman just comes off as tired and lame. The movie's war scenes smack more of Iron Man than Dark Knight. The movie desperately tries to prove how bad-ass Bane is, but he's just...not. Truly, I expected a scene with Bane loading cancer surviving, crippled grandmas into a bus and blowing them up. It was that silly. All the subplots slow things down: I could care less about the backstory of the chick with the accent, Robin (gee, I didn't see that coming two hours before it happened), the corporate stuff, Alfred's blubbering. Dull, dull, dull. Lastly, the sound is amateur. Everything is pushed up front, so it's often difficult to understand dialogue. Just a disorganized mess.<br /><br />And the plot holes! How any partially educated person could watch this film and not reject it outright is beyond me. We made a game out of coming up with things that made no sense:<br />- If the room with the nuke could be flooded, why didn't Morgan Freeman do so when Bane was in the room stealing it?<br />- Why's it hard for Bruce Wayne to prove he'd been set-up financially when all trades were shut down and he lost everything while a terrorist was controlling the stock exchange?<br />- Why did the creepy businessman want Wayne Enterprises if it was falling apart? Why work with Bane? Hmmmm....&#34;Plan A: Try to buy Wayne out. Plan B: Hire a terrorist with a freaky mask to help me out.&#34; LOL!<br />- In what universe is a fingerprint at the exchange enough ID to buy 5 shares of Microsoft stock, let alone lose billions?<br />- How does low-level theif Catwoman hop onto a high-tech Batcycle and instantly know how to operate it?<br />- If the chick with the accent wanted to kill Bruce Wayne or destroy Gotham, why not just do it? Why wait a month?<br />- If she hates Bruce Wayne so much, why sleep with him? She gained nothing by doing that.<br />- Liam 'League of Shadows' Neeson doesn't find out his babymama is sent to prison, nor that she was pregnant and had a kid. But he DOES hear that she was killed there? How? The only people who would have known she was killed...were in prison!<br />- I totally believe that Bane could protect a little girl from being gang raped and killed in an Arab prison full of crazies.<br />- Did anyone ever find this 'League of Shadows' nonsense anything less than inane and hilarious?<br />- Why would the cops attack Bane and his men with billy clubs? Why not wait to see if the bomb is disarmed? If it's not, everyone is dead anyway. If it is, the army will be moving in.<br />- How exactly does a nuke powered device provide endless clean energy for a whole city? Oh, don't ask that...we need a nuke in the city so Bane can use it to take control.<br />- Where did Commissioner Gordon learn to deactivate a high tech, unstable nuke?<br />- A technology that can wipe your record clean? Um...&#34;So, Miss Kyle, show me your work history for the last ten years? Oh you have any? Thank you for your interest, we'll let you know.&#34; Technology of this kind isn't possible.<br />- It's nice to know if you have a broken back, chest, and whatever that you can recover in a few weeks by being punched in the back, strung up with rope overnight, and eating nothingbut prison food while living in a hole in the desert. Pushups and situps work wonders too.<br />- A hole/prison wired for TV? And you can get channels from the US.<br />- After Batman is stabbed so that he is helpless, how does he suddenly recover enough to chase down the nuke?<br />- After the sewers were blown up, the football field just couldn't take it. But streets with skyscrapers are AOK.<br />- If you can just knock down sewer walls, you can access the most secret caches of technology held by rich corporations.<br />- If the autopilot was fixed, why did Batman lie and say it wasn't? And since he knew it had been fixed, why not just haul the bomb off thirty minutes earlier and get it somewhere really far away? Why waste time in a chase to reinstall it into the sci-fi, Morgan Freeman gadget?<br />- Exactly what medical condition related to Bane's mouth is controlled by a silly looking mask?<br />- Really? In a big city like Gotham, every cop in the city is sent into the sewers. Every single one?<br /><br />I don't want to give the impression with this list that we thought deeply about this at all. We didn't. This is just what we came up with while making fun of this stupid movie. I'm sure if we applied some considered thinking, this non-script would yield a dozen more idiotic gems. But I think I've made my point. 0 stars.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Love her music! Just what I expected! I like getting the cd and having it available on the cloud player also!!
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I had been hearing about this &#34;Game of thrones&#34; from friends and family alike. But i never ended up following through with watching it. It wasn't until a buddy of mine showed me a clip of this long haired savage (Drago) pour  kettle of boiling gold on this white haired skinny guy lol. That clip forced me to buy this gift set.<br /><br />I have to say that from start to finish, The Game of Thrones season 1 had me and my wife hooked! Between all the deceit, treachery, violence, gore, and yeah even sex, i was fully invested. I'm usually not big into fantasy but i am all in. We just bought season 2 yesterday and cant wait for the fun to resume.<br /><br />If you dont have this series in your collection, then your not a person i would ever want to meet..........seriously ;).

B000SEGUDE|4.0|A very interesting set of stories taking place over centuries, all related by the same, but changing, character. Incorporates philosophical ideas - in particular, reincarnation. I enjoyed it.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|The only other album I have from this band is their greatest hits.  I have never been much of a fan but love some of their older songs.  I saw they had come out with a new album and decided to pick it up.  For me the barometer for a good album is the top 25 playlist on my ipod.  What I listen to in the car, what I listen to in the gym.  With as new as this album is, I was very suprised the other day to find one song already at number 19 - quite a few plays on the workout playlist.  While I don't love every tune, there are some very good ones on this effort.  Highly recommended if you liked some of their older songs.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing book. Shows how love can be found through unexpected circumstances. The man up above is always looking down and watching out for you. Love it!
B008CLI4N4|3.0|Its put together well.  The acting is great for the most part and the sets are well done.  The problem I have with it is that its just not as good as the book.  I have read the series twice up to the fifth book, and while I have some issues with the story at times the books are very well done and the writing is exceptional.  The problem with the TV series is there is no way they can fit in all the goodness of the books into a TV show.  While I admire what the TV production team has done, I just think to myself 'Why am I watching this when I could read it again and its so much better??'  For a straight TV show its great, as an alternative to the book series I would have to say stick with the books.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I became a fan of Suits after seeing the advertisements in NYC subways and going home to see what that show as all about. I immediately got hooked on the first season. I own all the episodes and Season 2 was by far the greatest thus far. Highly recommended!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Have been wondering why this series has been more popular than Upstairs Downstairs. Better production values, of course. But Julian Fellows appears to be a master storyteller
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was a reading group suggestion, which upon finishing the book, I  wondered why it was chosen.  A fluff mystery did not lend itself to much substantive discussion.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|This movie disappointed me. I am a huge fan of sci-fi, and love films about exploring space, first contact, etc. I thought the cast was kind of wasted. The photography was very dark. The subject matter was dark. This movie was about searching for the origins of humanity in space. There was so much potential. I feel like an opportunity was missed to say something uplifting and profound. Instead it was the usual characters creeping around in the dark and encountering a lot of gore. There is obvious potential for a sequel. In the right hands, it could be much more interesting.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I've seen Lincoln, Argo, Django and Silver Linings Playbook, all great in their own ways and still wonder why this film went \\"under the radar\\". It's special in its own unique way and emotionally loaded. Now I need to go back and watch the documentary on Mark O'Brien's life. Thanks for introducing me to him and his world.<br />  Follow-up: As difficult as Mark O'Brien's life seemed in The Sessions, the documentary about him revealed that it was so much more difficult in actuality. Both movies provide a complete perspective on his life with his severe disability.

B009UZBLSG|5.0|I have an LG Nexus 4. The way Google intended Android to live. That being said, this SlimPort® adapter does what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />The difference between this and an MHL adapter is that you do not need a power cord to be plugged into it. SlimPort® just takes your phone's screen, and outputs it into HDMI.<br /><br />Why do I love this? Well, I purchased a JBL 5.1 surround sound system and an A/V receiver. I output everything onto a ViewSonic® projector. (All of these products were purchased on Amazon.com). Plugging my Nexus 4 into HDMI, I get my phone on a 100 inch display.<br /><br />Protip: If you're phone supports SlimPort® (which is definitely the Nexus 4), you can plug your phone into your TV, projector, etc. Then get a Bluetooth™ keyboard and mouse, which Android 3.0 and up supports, and use your phone as a computer! With a keyboard and mouse connected to an Android phone, you will get a mouse cursor, and the touch keyboard will be hidden while the Bluetooth® keyboard is connected. It's a great way to have a portable media center.

B0006L0LOS|1.0|Back in 2005 I saw this atrocity in theaters and left very unsatisfied. However, the other day I bought it for a quarter because sometimes when movies are so bad they become enjoyable just to laugh at. I hadn't seen it since the time at the theater but I figured for a quarter I couldn't really go wrong. Somehow now though, I still feel cheated.<br /><br />What can be said that hasn't been said before? This garbage which posed as a DC Comics movie is, as you've heard hundreds of times, nothing at all like actual Catwoman. The only matching point is the name. However, knowing that and going in a second time to watch it as a stand alone superhero movie it still falls flat on its face. Halle Barry is at her worst as she awkwardly struts around in some trashy torn up clothes and whips around a mostly CGI whip. The effects in this movie are playstation 1 if not worse level graphics and the plotline, written by three people, is worse than most that you would find on the Scyfy channel.<br /><br />There are absolutely no redeeming qualities in this movie; it isn't even a good one to make fun of with friends. The jokes that you could make would be too easy and after a while it'd be like beating a dead horse.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I bought this DVD for 25 cents and I feel ripped off.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I can always count on Preston and Child to deliver a superbly written engaging story. Couldn't put the book down! Once you start reading a novel of this calibre you can't put it down. Looking forward, as always, to the next book in this series.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|At first I did not want to see this movie, it looked very indie and very preachy and like every other movie ever made. I watched it on a whim during a boring overnight shift and expected it to be something to make fun of later.<br /><br />It's difficult to describe just how badly it was advertised. This movie is not a laugh out loud comedy though it is very funny in some parts. At points it's very serious and very sad but it makes this all the more realistic considering it's plot line. This is probably the first and only movie I've seen that actually has a realistic depiction of people with depression. Masterful acting all around gives you a perfect example as well as the outside parties who simply do not understand how depression works. Zach Galifianakis actually uses his acting abilities and plays one of his best roles he's ever been in. He's not a comedic lead as was advertised he is much better.<br /><br />This movie is just really well done and very well rounded. It's light hearted and uplifting but really packs an emotional punch. You should ignore the reviews, previews or whatever else and go see it for yourself. It was not like anything I had heard or expected.
B00005M91K|4.0|Interesting study of different places and events in the world that most people don't see, except some specials on TV.  Here, it's all together.  I especially want to show it to my grandson who thinks everybody lives in a large, beautiful city in the Bay Area--with excellent schools and a lot of intelligent people around!

B00B2QA646|3.0|I think the version of this that Amazon is streaming is missing several important scenes I saw in earlier trailers; just the same, even with them, I have the feeling the movie fails in some really important ways to deliver the plot that made the novel classic.<br /><br />At least one older movie (the one with Vivien Leigh) did a far better job of showing how Anna and Vronsky's affair was doomed from the start - neither one can keep the affair AND the things that make life satisfying for them. In the Leigh version, you see clearly how bored they both are after they run away to Italy and are completely severed from their life in Russia - Vronsky wilts without the military friendships that he lives and breathes; and Anna becomes desperate when, without her high-class family and society friends, Vronsky becomes her ONLY lifeline. Her desperation makes her manic, and though he truly loves her, her constant anger and jealousy in the face of his constant efforts to keep their relationship together, can only eventually make him want to escape. The clear deterioration of their relationship due to the pressures that were in it from the beginning is not so clear in this version.<br /><br />Anna's suicide seems very sudden and senseless. There is no searching of self or mourning for lost honour as in the Leigh version, where Leigh's Anna is revealed to herself to have been selfish and dishonorable... loving no one, not even her son, as much as herself.<br /><br />I disagree with other viewers who thought Vronsky was mis-cast. I thought he was excellent, though it was difficult to see how the affair kept momentum as long as it did, and the movie leaves his fate after Anna's suicide a blank. However, the movie starts off in such a choreographed, artificial manner that it is almost burlesque, with a synchronized army of paper-stampers weaving in and out of rouged accordion players... and it switches between a natural style and a burlesque style without any discernible reason. Alsothe theme of the train, which possibly represents fate either carrying us to a happy ending if we search for something other than gratification or running us down if we don't, is very strong in the beginning, but really lost by the time Anna's suicide at the end.<br /><br />Connecting with the characters was difficult. I could not respect Anna, who thought about no one's pain but her own throughout the movie. I really felt for Karenin, who's warning to Anna was so verbally emotionless and accurate although he was clearly feeling great emotion at every step of Anna's betrayal. He wasn't a perfect husband (and again, other versions show him neglecting his family in favor of his career) but Anna's subsequent obvious contempt and hatred was so unjustified and painful to watch.<br /><br />I think it is worth seeing, but seeing other versions too will give you the rest of the story that this one left out.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Actually, a good history lesson for those who were not born before 1970. It shows how and why we were involved in Iran, and how it all turned to poop. The side story, a very good one at that, shows how those who believed in the American Idea of exceptionalism prevailed. A good start for conversation regarding what American stands for.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|This movie has been really hyped.  I thought its really overrated. Slow moving, it just drags on.<br />It may win some awards but thats because of smart marketing, not content.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story was not easy to get into.The norm for Vegas's saying what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Except when you wake up married after a night of drinking and the guy doesn't want a divorce.<br /> The story is funny and touching at times. She struggles with wanting true love and he just wants a partner in life without love till he realizes he wants her after she leaves.
B007UXT6T6|5.0|Very good picture.... story line was incredibly irresistible... couldn't get enough of this movie..... yeah all should catch this... its the real deal
B002PMV9FG|4.0|As the HP movies evolve, I ask myself, where are the earlier innuendos of moving trees, flying owls, talking pictures, and roaming ghosts.  It's as if just because the leads are growing up, typical muggle romantic angles prevail. Gone are the days of cheery fantasy, and now we must deal with love affairs, growing up, and death. I don't read the books, therefore I miss nothing, but the lead actors are so captivating, they could eat a bowl of rice, & still make it seem worthwhile. Hard  handedness subject matter begin to make this HP a much more dark and sinister of the series. I miss the goblins & ghoulies.
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Story line seemed to follow my favorites... \\"Fifty Shades\\" ... Good read... i will get the next one too
B000HX4ZF6|1.0|This movie borders on the ridiculous.  Historically it takes too much license, and while the battle scenes were well done, the script was poor
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I cannot wait to reap the benefits of this book and experience. There is already a sense of piece that has come over me.
B0091REZMW|2.0|started the game everything was good except when i found the item i was supposed to find it would not pick it up.great graphics looks like it would be a good game but i could not get it to work right only got to the 2nd level after much frustration uninstalled it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you don't like this game you are dead to me it is a fun multiplayer game that you can play with.your friends in the same world.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This movie was not about the flight but the fact that the Pilot is held to such a high standard that we forget his human weaknesses. It also reveals how people with problems hide behind their problems rather than face them.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I rate this five stars. I can't describe the way I feel about this book, it's amazing and I am truly speechless. It took me a whole of 1 day to finish this. Truly fantastic.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This was a great episode.  Things are heating up between Alisha and will and I love it!! Can't wait to see the next episode
B0036G8IQS|5.0|This was so amazing and I love the way the whole thing was set up. I would recommend this book to anybody who has a desire to be amazed.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Like all Jack Reacher novels it was suspenseful right to the end. I would recommend it to anyone who likes drama and action.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|AMAZING book! It's a wonderful story and really makes you think about the beautiful things in life. I will definitely read again!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy continues to weave an intricate web of characters in an international plot which, unfortunately, is reflected in current revelations.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary is a very good learning tool for ages 14 and up. Having these dictionaries in your classroom is very good.

B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great show! A must see show! Themes are from today's headlines & you get to see how politics work in today's society!
1582701709|5.0|This book is a great encouragement especially for a Christian who has a foundation in Christ.  It's basically taking Bible principles and showing you how to live a successful life with examples of people who have adopted these principles.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Ayn Rand is still a good read after all these many decades!  I'm glad I waded all the way through this again!
0142423432|4.0|This book is a very quick read. I'm a slow reader but it didn't take me long to finish. It made a good vacation book. To me, Fantastic Mr. Fox is like a mother making up a story to her child at bedtime. It reads like a fairytale. This might have been one of the stories Dahl told his children and he later decided to make into a book. It wouldn't surprise me. It's not a complicated story, with characters that only have one goal but its fun.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to scores of people; any Dahl fan, anyone with young children, and people who are children at heart.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|What a great movie to celebrate 50 years of James Bond, 007. The tradition is improving with every Daniel Craig movie.
0316044938|4.0|Oh, The Lovely Bones. You probably know what you are getting into before you ever read it. You are fully aware that the book is about a teenage girl, Susie, who is raped (though the rape part is more of an undercurrent in the book) and murdered. The story is told through Susie, who is in heaven, watching the aftermath of her death. The audience gets to watch her family and friends through the healing process and her murderer get antsier. The novel goes through almost ten years after she passes away and it's interesting to see how the family progresses or declines. But I, like others apparently, were not too happy with how the story turns out. The book started getting bad when the miraculous event with Ray occurred and it goes downhill from there. If you are looking for justice for Susie's murder, you won't get it, which had me ranting to anyone who would listen. I can understand why Sebold ended the book the way she did. Cold cases don't always get solved or have happy endings. Susie was one of them. But her family grew from the tragedy anyway. I will also say though, the character development in this book disappointed me because there was little to none, which doesn't make sense for this subject matter. Despite this book's faults, I really did love it. I look forward to reading more books by this author.
1568363842|5.0|The speakers on the CD are accurate in the speed and flow of the Japanese language.  For some people it may seem too fast, but that is the natural way that people speak in Japan.
0316056898|4.0|When I first saw that Tina Fey was coming out with a book, I needed to own it. Come on, just look at the cover! The major plus of the audio book is that Fey reads it herself, and does voices, impressions, etc. I really can't imagine reading the hardback now because hearing Fey read her own story was so perfect, and reading it in my head would have made this story awful. If you get this book, please just get the audio book. You'll understand and thank me.<br /><br />Fey combines telling the audience about her personal experiences and issues in her life with comedy. When I say personal, I mean personal. Fey tells us about her first period, first pap-smear, how she was virgin all through college, her experience breast feeding her daughter, etc. She also discusses issues like blonde envy, gay rights, photoshopping, etc.<br /><br />There was a couple parts I didn't really enjoy, but that is really just my personal preference. But I did find that Fey is honest and says things that I completely agree with and I'd whoop and cheer because no one says these things. And I actually found myself listening for advice when she talked about having children and marriage.  It's just interesting how much variety this book has.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to Tina Fey fans (wow, really?), women who want to read about other women in careers, or if you want to read something personal yet funny.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game infact its probibly my faviorite game but its a complete copy of temple run for example the cop is a coppy of the mutant moody whale things. but I gotta hand it to them the moving trains were a good idea.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great app, there are so many different puzzles to choose from, lots of variety in subjects, some photographs, some artwork the choices are never ending.
B002RKRV4Y|5.0|The book lived up to the reputation it has, and more. I am not a fan of long winded philosophical novels, but this one, it is far from that. I expected some mystic mumbo jumbo but came away with the simplest of truths explained in a beautiful story.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|This is the second time I have watched this movie. I recommend it highly for lighthearted entertainment about a woman who was bold for her time .
B009EEFTMC|5.0|challenging game play, very addictive, purchased as free app of the day but is the only game I play now
B003EY7IUY|5.0|l loved all the shopaholic books. They were funny, and had a plot that kept me reading. i loved them
B004GTOKJS|4.0|These last 3 episodes move a lot faster and have more plot lines.  Young Harry is a darling and so is his benefactor.<br />I was sorry to say good-bye to the residents of Cranford.  I will miss them.  Dame Judi brought Miss Mattie full circle in her character development and the coming of the train will change Cranford forever.
B001F6TXME|5.0|It works just as you would predict it would, no fancy tricks or menus to dig through. I found that on my d3100 the cable was a bit tight in its socket, but on my d7000 this isn't the case. Either way, just dont yank on it. I wish it came with a case or some way of tying up the cable, but short of that this trigger works perfectly and I prefer it to the wireless wherever possible. I primarily use this when shooting macro work to eliminate camera shake at finer ISO's. Really, it's a well made product and worth every cent.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|As someone who relates to these characters on multiple levels, I found this book very inspiring. If you have been misunderstood and felt alone and traumatized you will love this book. Ultimately it is a story of survival. How friends can pick you up,, dust you off and set you on your feet. It is a profound look at the realities of high school life. It will leave you: in tears, laughing, empathizing, concerned and many other emotions.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This thing works out wonderfully with my d7000. in iTTL everything comes out clear and predictable, and the added accessories do a good job at making sure you're set for whatever situation you are shooting. I wish we could use the remote function without the built in commander, but I havent had trouble with it so I have to say Im in love with it. Great product, for basic enthusiast work, this flash is a better value than the SB-900/910.
B0011EVSGE|5.0|I enjoyed this very much. I watched it with my grand son and he loved dancing to the songs. Will share again.

B00B7PIRIE|3.0|Downton Abby has delighted and disappointed  me, all at the same time.  I had thought that BBC and Masterpiece Theatre produced insights into historical events for the purpose of enlightening the less educated American population who attended public school.<br />I truly enjoyed the DVD of the first season. There were bonus material that I enjoyed.  The production staff person commented that in the domestic scenes the household staff did not usually have hidden sexual activity either among themselves or with the family; and then, in Series 2, there it was.  I am tired of historical drama descending into to soap opera scandal.  The viewing audience misses all the real exciting life of running a huge estate.  Would it have been too inappropriate to include some of the wonderful actual events that happened at Highclere?<br />In season 3, I realized that Cora was Jewish!  The only Jewish girl who would have been acceptable among the English peerage would be a Rothschild.  Since Julian Fellows wished to show the Anti-Catholic attitude, he should have also showed the Anti-Jewish attitude, which was, at the time, just as vehement in both Britain and the United States.  Not only was the 5th Earl of Carnarvon wife Jewish, she was also Rothschild’s illegitimate daughter.  Truth is stranger and more interesting than fiction.<br />Also, in the Season 3, writer Julian Fellows, the dastard, kills off a major rising character.  Instead, why could he not include some of the actual events in the life of Highclere’s 5th Earl of Carnarvon from 1907 through 1923.  The real Earl was a horse enthusiast who owned and raced thoroughbred horses. He was a steward for the Newbery Racecourse.  He was also an automobile enthusiast and a very reckless driver.  After an almost fatal car accident [1901], he travelled to Egypt and became interested in archeology and financed Howard Carter for 15 years before he discovered Tutankhamen.  Why didn’t the film historian insist on including one of the greatest events of the 20th century. Can’t Masterpiece Theatre produce historical program with real insight into the running of a large estate and the varied interests of an extremely wealthy man?  The dinners would be filled with wonderful conversations on world events, racing and archeology.  The family dialog in the series would have been enhanced by archeologists citing events in Egypt, visits to and from Egypt, introducing a meeting between the Earl and Gaston Maspero, Carter and many others.  It would not, then, be necessary to make up tawdry affairs about the family and servants. It could have replaced the entire section on the predicament of Mr. Bates.<br />Julian Fellows has instead, degraded the series’ characters with smutty soap opera scenes.  Wasn’t this the same writer who had the servant spiting on the silver in “Godsford’s Park”, just because he was the writer and could put in what he wanted.<br /><br />I love the beautiful scenery but the story line and dinner dialog is uninteresting.  I really want to feel I have learned something about England, Wales and Scotland and have a small peak into British history without the soap opera drama.  It was almost as if Mr. Fellows, once he fell into the gutter couldn't get out of it.  The family has seen too much dead. You could have devised a good horse racing event or a trip to Egypt.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Pretty good series of books.Interesting concept on the future.I would like to see a continuation of the story line and see where it went.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This movie was a christmas gift that I got for my cousin for her grandchild. It has always been on of my favorites.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Quick, easy and amazing!  I found the movie fabulous and can see on all electronic equipment.  Good to know Amazon offers this service.
B00APAENUI|5.0|The author constantly surprised me with the emotional effort to wring the best of morals from this character.  Unfortunately, or fortunately it seems like the series of books continues to amaze me in the character development of the cast of characters and Honor.  I am enjoying re reading the series as I do not remember when the actions occurred because the series is so long.  Like a soap opera it continues on.  I would like to see a movie of Honor but then that is a horse of a different character.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot!  A talking teddy bear is clearly silly (sorry Ted) but it is one of the most fun comedies that I've seen.  I don't care for slap stick and this really isn't.  Ted grows on you as the movie develops.
B00914JWSW|5.0|OK - I'm a huge fan of Streisand and so I was so glad to get a new album with a few new songs.  Her voice is so clear and crisp and her diction is unmatched.

B00BHMF578|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in quite a while.  Based on a true story -- truth is better entertainment than fiction.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very realistic and a mixture of romance, love, violence, suspense and mystery.  Am looking forward to seeing the movie that just came out.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Incredible insights into the psychology of change, grounded in research and interesting real-life examples. This book should be read by every person responsible with leading a team or an organization.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this App is just like taking care of your own horse. i have always wanted a horse of my own and now i do.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I thought it was time I put in my two cents on this, the movie version of Les Miserables. I have seen the play four times.Once in LA, once in Seattle, and twice in Florida and I must say each time was a thrilling experience. Having said that, my wife and I were really looking forward to the movie version.To be honest after seeing the stage show ,which was consistant each time I don't think I would have ever considered Hugh Jackman for the part of Jean Valjean but I must say he suprised ,delighted, and hit it out of the park for both of us. Another stellar performance was Anne Hathaway's Fantine and her rendition of I dreamed a dream. It was a stunner. Of all the times I have seen the show , nothing came close to her heart breaking performance .She brought me to tears.<br /><br />There were some changes and omissions but all in all the spirit, grandur,and the incredible music was there. Of course some things were better than others for instance,Helena Bonham Carter & Sacha Baron Cohen's Master of the House was just adequate but was a highlight in the show for comic relief. Here is my one rub. Les Miserables is not a musical, it is an opera, the difference is ,a musical has both spoken words and singing where an opera is singing only. When you see an opera you expect to have all actors with great singing voices. That brings me to Russell Crowe who plays Javert a main figure in both the play and movie. In the play Javert was powerful in both stature and voice . however, in Crowe's performance ,the stature was there but the voice was not and that was a bit of a disappointment thus, removing one star from my rating .<br /><br /> Bottom line, it is a great movie experience.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I liked the adaptation t convert the children's fairy tale to a more adult version of a story. Can't say too much because that would give away the plot twists to those who wish to buy and view it.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|The book wanders too much and leaves you working to keep up with the plot. Also the ending really sucks. Finally there is no mention as to which book is the next one in the series if you do want to continu. That is a major issue.
0553801473|4.0|I had to reread all of the previous works to get the story back.  Almost 5000 pages, and I now believe we are only half way through the story, if that much.
0156027321|5.0|Oh how I love this story. I just saw the movie in 3D and had to get the book because I adored it on the big screen. It did not disappoint me. The price was good and I got it in time. I recommend this book to all ages.
140123769X|4.0|I think of Fables as the best comic book series I've read. While the peak of Fables happened a while ago, the story continues to be strong and interesting. In this volume we follow one of the daughters of Snow White and Bigby as she becomes the Queen of Toyland. The story, as many Fables stories are, is quite dark.<br />This volume could even be read without having read Fables before, as the story is completely self contained. This can be good and bad, good because it's different than the recent volumes, but bad in the sense that it doesn't feature much time with characters that could be one's favorites (i.e., Bigby).<br /><br />Overall, this is another strong volume in this excellent long-running series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great. Better than the previous one I was using.  I could do without all the pop ups.  I understand the advertising and the free apps though.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very well written and spectacular in his explanations. Gives hope and understanding to the unknown. A world at which I myself was skeptical. Thanks for sharing your experience and knowledge. Great read!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Hard to put down - humor, action, science, sarcasm - what's not to like?  Can't wait for Mr. Weir's next adventure
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There's nothing more to ask than to include everything in the movie. Five stars without a doubt. Can't wait to read the second.
0385738765|5.0|As a lot of others are saying, this book is better than the first.  I read all three books in the regular series (excited to read the prequel next!) and out of the three this 2nd one is by far my favorite because of the amount of action, jaw-dropping twists, and new developments in the characters.<br /><br />i just want to say that it was this series that made me very interested in dystopian and so right after finishing the three books i went ahead and read the uglies and lauren oliver's delirium.  first of all, i couldn't even FINISH the uglies.  (i won't go into detail about that though since this is not an uglies review). similarly, i was able to finish delirium, BUT it was a pain to finish.  both books cannot even COMPARE with the maze runner trilogy, and with the scorch trials being the best book in the trio I would dare say that it far trumps those two other series by a mile.<br /><br />besides the INCREDIBLY fast-paced plot, this series is made fantastic and above the rest because of its characters. i feel so connected with thomas (esp after this book) but i have to say that my favorite characters are newt and minho.  and i REALLY REALLY LOVE newt. it's rare that i feel so strongly for certain characters (to the point where i get emotional if things don't work out for them) but this book did it for me.  i loved every single second of this book and even if you didn't really like the first book, you definitely won't be disappointed with this one.
B007X4ECLO|5.0|Super cute movie with something for everyone.  Would recommend to families with kids or grandkids.  I didn't even mind too much the 6th viewing in one day, requested by the 2 year old. lol
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book,makes you grateful for what you have. When life gets difficult we have to remember their are people who have it worse than we do. I would recommend this book to anyone it was a great book.

B00003CXCD|5.0|This classic show is delightful (nominated for several Academy Awards) It was especially wonderful after my trip to Rome, where it was entirely filmed. Watching the Directors segment really added a lot and I highly recommend everyone include this part.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Have a little trouble in the mine cart and grabbing power -ups on hills.  Otherwise, really really enjoy this &quot;2&quot; more than any other.
1569242739|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book. Easy to read format and really good recipes. Nice size to work from.  Ingredients are in the kitchen already.
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|This is an amazing score for a Bond film. A lot of action movies these days are starting to sound alike, this one really has it's own identity. With Mr. Craig we have a new James Bond, with Mr. Newman we now have the new sound. I love the movie and this masterpiece score!!!!!
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This movie is well displayed, with good sound. This is a well known movie, with a harsh realization that our soldiers are facing brutal condition often. But its a great movie.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I've really like this app. Beautiful graphics correspond to the actual weather happening outside as well as sun or moonlight... Free version gives me two cities to keep in memory which works out fine. I like the options for display and the option that lets me see either an hourly forecast or daily forecast.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|Very good film. Helped me to understand the age of Alexandria. The plot was hard to follow as to who was killing the people but it made me study farther to get a grip on the story.  Very well done.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Best film ever! Beautiful in every way.  My favorite characters are Mathew and Mary, Mr. Bates and Mrs. Hughes.  All of them were great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|There is lots to do in this game. Very user friendly. My only beef is that it is hard to get gems and stuff.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very awesome app to play when you are bored and need something to do at night. thanks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great. I love to care for a virtual pet, plus my little cousin loves to pet it.<br />I love it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is great! My hubby and I love all the superheros movies , but some are not as exciting as this one. We have seen the other superheros (Captain America, Ironman,etc.) and couldn't wait for this one to come out in the theatre. This movie will be on our list to grab for when you want a movie that is only action. The blue-ray is amazing. Enjoy!!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a fun game.  I recommend it to anyone. The graphics<br />are good and you can get around the game easily.  It is nice to have the hint option.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Album contained some good songs for the most part.<br />I didn't love all the choices but I would recommend it.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Interesting play, kind of short. Graphics were a little lacking, and mouths didnt move correctly. The puzzles were fun but some were too easy.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|At first I thought the authors description of heaven was rather basic. But in the end, he got it right.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played this on my moms ipad and its awesome I love it its really better then the first one
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|As a fan of Rebus was sorry when it looked as though he would retire, this book is a good return novel and was a good read every night and opportunity till it was finished. The book seemed at several points was destined to conclusion but carried on until its final conclusion and the title invoked towards the end (nearly missed it!!) Another Author who obviously researches his locations. Rebus however seemed to be enjoying his new (consultant) status and able to a certain extent able to work his own agenda. A memorable scene for me was him waiting as it got dark in a rural location a little fed up waiting for the other members to conclude the day when he hears a shout. He tries to climb over a barbed wire fence, snags his trousers and then after getting one leg over finds it is boggy ground on the opposite side inot which he goes ankle deep. I enjoyed it and a very good read and hope more Rebus novels will follow
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Attention people of earth.  Please don't die until you listen to this at least once. Loud.<br />Now, listen to every Bowie album that preceded it.<br />O.K. you're good to go.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I like this game.<br />The game it's pretty simple but sometimes its hard to play because  you need to use the screen.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|A friend suggested this and I am really glad I took him up on it.  Love the tech and science fiction
B00A3K2PZA|4.0|didn't like the ending.would recomend to friends .otherwise it was good.you require too many words when reviewing your movies.think about it. more people would rate them if you required less words
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Love the message the song portrays, never doubting the choices you once made, becoming a greater person.  Beautiful, inspiring, perfect.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|This movie again gave Holmes' fans a good chance to explore the adventures of this most famous detective. However, there are too many slow-motion-scenes that destroy the pace and bore the audience.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|What is up with this game? It keeps freezing then I have to uninstall the game then reinstall it losing all of my coins which ducks when I have spent real money for coins or gems.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this season! I couldn't put it down, it only took me a couple days to watch it. It was so suspenseful and being a scaredy cat I'm not sure how I made it through but it was well worth it!! I recommend this for everyone!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Ok so I have this game and it is awesome but highly addictive and l love it so much I highly recommend this you will love it
B000000WJ2|5.0|Not as consistent as &#34;Talk Is Cheap&#34;, but still better than most Stones' albums since Tattoo You.  (I said most people.)What a great band!  Riffs galore!  And a laid back vibe that can't be beat.  I guess I have to thanks Mick Jagger for the solo career obsession he had, since that's what pushed Keith to make this and &#34;Talk is Cheap&#34;.  I just wish he'd make another record with these guys.  Buy this now!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I've read for many years, read lots of drivel & rubbish. This is worth your time. Hard to put down. Well written.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Ordered this one principally for my wife to enjoy, which she did.  There were some goofy spots and some dumb decisions made by the characters that were only necessary to extend the story line, but overall, I enjoyed it too.
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|Any reason why &#34;The Best of My Love&#34; is not on any of the Eagle's DVD/Blu Rays? For some reason this song is left off all of their releases
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game never gets old! I love it! got this game for my kid but ended up loving it! I hope there's more add ons
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|A very fun game with a lot of levels. Very engaging and the graphics are just beautiful. A great way to pass the time if you enjoy a puzzle game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is Awesome!!! I am definitely looking forward to book three! However I am sad that this one is over
B0049EN064|5.0|Wonderful dvd, great picture quality. Show is one of a few that actually refuses to dumb down everything. . .
B002ZG999U|4.0|This is a great movie. It was good to watch these old men still able to play action seens. It is well worth the money you spend.
0783240287|3.0|show was great, but seems like the dvd is just a copy from a vhs tape. still worth the viewing though.
B00BESIKWM|2.0|BIG fan of the games. Not a fan of the movies nor the cult aspect of the movies. Glad to see this one had more nods to some of the elements of the game.<br /><br />In the end I think that they just cannot get these creepy games adapted into good movies.
B000FCKC4C|1.0|Masquerades as profound, but actually exceptionally trite.<br /><br />Peddles a dangerous & confused stew of sappy mysticism.<br /><br />To be avoided at all costs.
B008476HBM|2.0|Guess I am giving this book an unfair report, as I didn't get to even get it read.  So Inshouldnt be a judge for the book.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I bouught this the week it came out... i can't tell you how many times i listened to it already!! RiRi out did herself again!!!!
1250006341|5.0|Downton Abbey is addictive but the reality of the period in which the story takes place is fascinating and this book gives the background to what we see on the telly.  it explains so many aspects of that culture - why the cook and housekeeper are &#34;Mrs&#34;, the gulf between servants and those they served, why so many people went into service, etc.  Highly recommended both for Abbey fans and amateur historians who want an insider look at this society.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|It's a fun and addictive game, lol. Just wish there were better decoration options. Downfall to this game is that everything that is a cool decoration cost real money! Dont spend the cash you get in the beginning, you'll need it later.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this book insightful and well presented.<br />My reason in picking it up was solely based on the authors medical background. I was not disappointed.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this was a very good game. fun and creepy. my favorite kind. yes you have to pay for the full version but its worth it. I couldnt put it down til I was finished. try it I bet you will like it too.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I'm very appreciative that Dr. Alexander chose to write his story, to be brave enough to open himself up to the deluge of doubter commentary.  If our hearts are so hardened that we choose not to believe in God, in His unending love, and Heaven, then even those who read this book will scoff, but if it opens the mind of the doubter to the possibility, and a relationship with the Divine ensues, then he has accomplished what he set out to do and the world is a better place for it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it!! Fun and addictive. Also quite challenging when you get to the harder levels. It's a must-have app. Beware the Flow Addiction!
0061692034|4.0|This book has an interesting premise. Two children find out that their parents robbed a bank and go to jail. The children are left on their own, they tell the family story and how they make their way in the world. Great descriptions of the places and people they meet on their journey.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|So awesome to consider the timeliness,  the talents, the beginnings of the greatest rock band ever!!! So glad I own this.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great little game, even when you have completed all levels you can still go back and try to beat your previous scores. Better on a larger tablet screen than phone but most bad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this free app download from Amazon's App Store. I LOVE solitaire. As with most free apps, there are ads that pop up between games; however, clicking on the changing method of skipping them has become an art. Withing a few seconds of them popping up, I have learned where to find the &#34;moving&#34; option to skip or cancel and return to the game button. Sometimes it is a &#34;Skip&#34; bar that appears on the bottom of the screen when you click the ad, sometimes it is a small &#34;x&#34; in the upper corner of the screen. Whichever, I can quickly stop the ad and return to the game. Not a bad game, if you can stand the ads.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Finally, a jigsaw app that isn't about speed and high scores and competition!! This app has a relaxing melody on a well-designed loop, meaning you don't notice a blip when the loop starts over.  The app itself gives you a few puzzles to start with, but you can download tons of other ones straight to the app itself.  Most of them are free, but some of them are pay packs.  Even so, the pay packs come with at least a dozen or more puzzles so I feel like it's a good value.  There is also a small box of ads on the side of the free app, which you can pay to have removed although it's not that intrusive at all.  Technically speaking, this app is flawless - it has never crashed, froze, or force closed once in the several months I've been using this app on my kindle fire.  Also something to note - you can cut the pieces into several different sizes for increased difficulty. I love the 200-ish cut which is the smallest and most challenging, but my 3 year-old son loves playing them too at the 35-piece setting with much larger pieces. So I'm getting twice the value for this app.  All in all, I must say this is the best and most well-thought-out jigsaw puzzle app I've ever seen.  Well done ximad Inc.  Edit: I had a question about this app's puzzle packs that I sent to the developers via email at the beginning of December.  It took them nearly THREE MONTHS (the end of February) to finally respond to my email, and when they did they didn't even answer the question I had asked.  I took away two stars for such poor customer service - one star for the length of time it took to respond to my query, and another for how unhelpful their reply was when they finally did respond.  How disappointing.
B00632HWOG|4.0|The app was free. I originally had trouble loading my Yahoo mail to my Kindle Fire HD for some reason; so, I downloaded this from the Amazon [Kindle] App Store. It works just fine. However, I later got my Yahoo to work in the Kindle Fire HD email service area. No complaints...it works like it says it should.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I wanted an alarm to take with me that didn't require a plug everywhere I went.  this app works great for that.  it asks for the upgrade each time I use it which is annoying but tolerable.  only minimal alarm sounds are available and your own music can not be used without the upgrade.  good app overall.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This book had lots of twists and turns, but getting to the final revelation, was a bore.  I never skip paragraphs of a book, but I found this story contrived and long winded.  Save your time and read something else.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|3 Great movies in one collection for $10? - You can't beat that and they look great.  While the video quality is not as great as movies released today they look great on BD (much better then any DVD).
B000002AGN|5.0|This is an incredible classic and should be in every music lover's library.  I have the vinyl and decided that I should have this on CD to listen during my commute.  I am so glad that Amazon.com made it available for purchase.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|FAST SHIPPNG, AND A GREAT CD. I LOVE ELLIE, I HAVE BOTH HER CD'S AND THEY'RE BOTH DECENTLY PRICED, WISH I COULD SEE HER LIVE IN CONCERT WHILE SHE'S TOURING WITH BRUNO MARS THIS YEAR!
0307742997|4.0|I listened to about half of this on an audio CD from the library, but thought it was too good to just listen to so I bought the book. Currently I am only about 3/4 of the way through the book because I only read it a little before bedtime, but it is a good book. I like the descriptions that Jo Nesbo uses and that is something I have always liked about books. Can the author paint a word picture that you can almost see.<br />Ray Shingler 2.25.2013 @4:53 p.m.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Very entertaining.  Can be played everywhere.  I play it while waiting for an appointment.  I would reccomend it to anyone that likes a challenge.
B00B01XDTI|3.0|Its lacks the cutting edge the original had, lame plot and bad acting inthe main roles. I wouldnt recommend it unless you really like horror movies..
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a good book. I enjoyed it so much and it deffiniatly lived up to the others. I couldnt put it down. I just wish i could write like this
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I can only back up what everyone else here is saying. this story is amazing and everyone should read it. Its just really really great. Hugh Howey has a winner with WOOL and I cant wait for the rest.
0062200909|5.0|I was a little wary of this after I read some reviews questioning the quality or authenticity; but my book was in perfect condition, and it is, of course, an excellent art book.
B004NELBPC|4.0|I love HUFF POST and this is a great app. Gives me just the right news content and allows me to get caught up on the important things.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Different more than expected. He is so complex. I cannot wait for the next book. I hope it is as hood.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and I rate this among the better ones. His characters are unusual and colourful and the twist at the end as machiavellian as in any of his other books. This is a good read and a welcome addition to the Grisham library.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Engrossing story, a real page turner, though it did get a bit tedious in the middle. Fairly well done, with a rich cast of characters. Mostly believable with several twists and turns. I liked Landay's style of writing, I liked the weaving of the courtroom testimony with the real-life events. But, in the end, he spent too much time on the genetic component of the story. I think the book would have been  more effective (and shorter!) had he left that out. I saw parts, but certainly not all, of the ending. Well worth the read just for the ending.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|We couldn't find one in our DVD Collection so we rented it from amazon and remembered how great of a movie it is
B009CPES4I|4.0|The story was believable, the hotel owner was charming.  As much as i liked the gay guy, I am saddened that so many films must promote the gay agenda.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie left a s*** ton of stuff out and added some parts that werent in the book a little dissapointed
B007PF7MGS|5.0|The level of detail and informatioin in this book is very helpful for people who viewed Forks Over Knives and want to practice plant-based eating. You may be surprised to learn how easy the transition is!
0439023513|5.0|Great series haven't read it yet but am on my way after the second one but the first was Phenomenal
B000YHG72E|5.0|Love this film.  It's funny, sweet, silly, odd and endearing.  I love Will Ferrell as Buddy the elf and you will too.
0439023491|5.0|Great series haven't read it all yet but am on my way after the second one but the first was Phenomenal
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love this Show.  It's great writing, intriguing characters and beautiful to look at.  I've enjoyed this season as much as the first and am looking forward to the next.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I now have all three seasons.  It is an ongoing story that fascinates me.<br />While I was saddened that a couple characters were killed off, it now makes me<br />more curious how the story will go on without them.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I am glad that I took the time to explore life through Brian Warner and Marilyn Manson. This offered many insights into the psyche of myself and into the mind of a great artist and author. Thank you for the read.
0765325950|1.0|The book has several pages that have spots on them and page 597 is almost unreadable because of the black ink all over the page.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is truly art. I can only think to say thank you to these artists that brought us a piece of Hip hop history. An amazing story awaits.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this series!!!!!  I watched the entire season on my Kindle Fire and the streaming was perfect.  It was like watching it on a tv.
B0064W65SO|5.0|A cult classic that delivers time and time again. I can't say how much I enjoy Batman from most others. I do know that this will shed some light into the darkness that is Gotham and her Protector.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book really quick! I love the in depth exploration of Pat, was realistic and exciting! A must read.
1616550414|5.0|Thank you to Miyamoto and the Legend of Zelda team for sharing this timeless gift with us. I gifted this to a great friend and he loves it. I can't wait to bring my own copy home.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Fits well in the Resident Evil story line.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Leon since RE4<br /><br />Great picture and sound.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. It's so fun and its not a dumb simple game. It requires thinking and treating it like it's a real live horse.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I never understood what the hoopla was all about, until I started playing it myself. There is something to be said for blowing things up to release the caged birds... :)
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is another example of how Bruce Springsteen has remained an amazing performer and songwriter. Every song on this CD is amazing and you will find yourself picking a couple favorites - Shacked and Drawn, Rocky Ground, Land of Hope and Dreams, American Land ...those are my repeat plays everytime I listen; which happens to be everyday. It's been many many years since he was the regular guy from Jersey, but he remains a friend to the regular guy/woman. His lyrics speak of the collective pain felt from the recession, the angry finger pointing of immigration reform and the redemption found in God. Lastly, he reminds us that we are all Americans and we don't or shouldn't leave each other behind.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|I look TI and the CD is the bomb.  Lots of hot tracks.  I waited a long time for the CD and it was worth it.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Never grow tired of watching this movie.  Always makes me long for a glass of delicious Pinot Noir or French Rose.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was a book that took me forever to read. It's definitely different and witty but not my style. I was disgusted and completely disappointed with the ending.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great read that is compelling and intricate in its detail. A coming of age story that is set in a fantasy world, but is presented in a manner that makes it feel less fictional. An excellent beginning to an epic that will certainly eclipse other stories by its sheer magnitude.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This movie was quirky and different but I found it very slow and really not that entertaining so I can't jump on the band wagon here with all the 4 & 5 star reviews. I feel like people think it's hip to love anything with Edward Norton and gave this movie a little too much credit because he was in it.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|This was a great game until I got to a level that had an item behind the menu tab.  Sent a notification to the developer hoping that an update would be done to fix it but heard nothing back before posting this review.  Disappointed because I don't purchase apps very often and this reminds me why I usually like to stick to the freebies.<br /><br />Bottom line: Do not purchase for Kindle Fire HD as you will not get to play the whole game.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love it got very quickly and a great price! I would recommend this site for future purchases. Very nice speed.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|You can't go wrong with it. It's facebook. I prefer my computer over my kindle app for more detailed things, but for just the basic wall and status updates this is great.
B002RI9PS6|5.0|Another perla of Lewycka's literary talent and a gift of storytelling in a hilarious laugh-your-head-off manner. This time it's a love story of an old Ukrainian widower living in England and madly falling in love with a much younger Ukrainian woman. His two grown up daughters each with kids of their own, one divorced, one married start a campaign against fraudulent bride which ends up well for everyone...? In between mostly funny bits we get more somber and heart-wrenching stories of what it was like to live in Ukraine during communist regime and what this family had to get through. All the characters are believable, well wrtitten, touchingly and down to earth human. The main hero Ukrainian widower half mad half a genius writes a history of tractors interwoven into the story hence the title.
B00A757EFW|3.0|The game is good, but I personally think it's a little hard to operate. However, I am technologically challenged, so it could just be me.
B0082FPIY8|3.0|I believe a story like this one have their place in literature - a cathartic journey of one desperate grieving soul after two major hardships  in life, her mother's premature death & her own divorce after struggles with marital fidelity and flirting with drugs. Another autobiography. Nowhere near as engaging, witty or brilliant as f.i. &#34;Scandalands&#34; yet worth reading. I must admit I struggled a bit with the long and boring at places narrative, with the fact that not much really happened on Cheryl's hiking trip on Pacific Trail Crest and lots of this book was perfect for a secret diary of one's personal journey yet not quite polished and attractive for wide reading audience. Def appealing to female not so much to male reader.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The twitter app is just as good as any facebook, fantasy football, pinterest, email, etc. apps. You can do whatever you need to for your twitter account, updates, and followings.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, I really think that I will check and see if the author has any other books out I was definately not dissapointed with this one
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app is a Killer! (In more ways than one) It was a bit tricky to figure out how to work at first, but it seems to have really helped my battery life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|THIS IS THE FIRST TIME i HAVE EVER READ A BOOK LIKE THIS, ALL i CAN SAY IS WOW, I HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED THE SECOND ONE, I am so excited to find out what happens next!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game! However, i only gave 3 stars bc the game does not sync info to more then 1 device even when using the same account. I had the game on my phone then recently got a kindle fire HD 8.9&quot;. After installing on my kindle and logging in with my FB only my high score was transferred but none of my hover boards, characters, coins, multiplier or upgrades...NOTHING! And I emailed support with NO response! Please fix for a 5 start.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS BOOK BEFOREI WAS DONE WITH THE FIRST, I FELL IN LOVE WITH CHRISTIAN AND ANNISTASIA, CANT WAIT FOR MORE
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game because it can do a awesome things like jumping with the boots and jump over trains and change your characters
B003YFIUW8|5.0|this story touched my heart, I really wasn't sure what to expect when I began reading but honestly this heartbreaking story turned out to be one of the best I have read in months!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am constantly reading, I go through at least four books a week. However this is my first time to review a book. It's not the first time I've been deeply touched by a book, but it is the first time I've felt the need to share how much a book affected me. I read a lot of YA books and find myself drawn to romances, this one is the first that kept me guessing almost the whole time. Usually I can figure out where the author is going with the novel but this one catches you off guard. It's a beautiful love story but there's much more to it. You feel an instant connection with the characters and feel their pain. It was really refreshing because it was different from most of the normal love stories. This book was very tastefully written. Loved this book and it definitely deserves 5 stars!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I special ordered early and had it on the day it was released, I definately was not dissapointed, I am a huge nicholas sparks fan and this book has just made me remember why!!!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Loved the book. Was a nicely done child fantasy.  I would recommend this to anyone. P.s. watch the movies too!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this book was amazing, I heard about it on the radio and I am so glad I did, I could not put it down!!!! AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I rated this book so high because I have read all these books over 30 times I love it it is so romantic
B00007E7K0|5.0|this product works on all my lenses, I am forever losing lens caps, this product was as described and works well
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the realistic goals to obtain free coins. A lot better than most games that make you take huge surveys to get extra coins for free.
B00AY9RV90|2.0|It sounds as if New Order are tired of being New Order but got together one more time just for the heck of it. Or for the check.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I like Bubble Mania , it too is great for passing time , while waiting at the airport or Dentist Office
B009AY04A8|4.0|Good game but some items are alittle hard ros see. You should not be pentalized for touching the screen to move the screen around to find objects. Did have difficulty with the last chapter but for the most it was worth the price &amp; fun.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This is one of the very few apps that continue updating in Amazon app store and keep it the same version as the other.<br /><br />And this is the best pool game in the market, good job
B005USZYDU|4.0|Nice to see J.G. move away from the tired formula or rut he wad in for a long time! Not only did he drop the theme of the lawyer managing to walk away with a huge pile of cash, but this story also flows straight through a chronological order, and follows one character, instead of constantly jumping around following a half dozen people:)
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It has a nice pace to it. Makes you think about what matters in life.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|Every time I want to make a video it won  let me, it just keeps on saying camera stopped!!! Ugh I'm not happy with this!
1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton is one of my favorite authors and she did not disappoint! I love her easy to read style and the way she develops the story. Just when you think you have everything figured out she throws in a new twist. This was a real page turner. A great read!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I liked this book. Because  Greg was uh uhh nice and uhh cool so uhh yeah I just finished the book and uhh yeah so yeah....
B005HEPIDS|4.0|My favorite characters were Harry, Seven, and the Doctor. I really liked all the episodes that featured them! Definitely worth watching.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My cousin had bought the game. So I was like this seems interesting. So I wen  to the app store and bought it. Now I play it everyday. I recommend it for every body. BEST GAME EVER.
B007ZXQNGA|4.0|It reinforced a lot and woke me up to the opportunities that are out there...and wonder why I spent so much previously developing other ideas..
B0034G4P4O|5.0|My introduction to the Tintin adventures was back in the 1960s when my father brought me back a copy of the Golden Press edition of &#34;Explorers on the Moon&#34; when he returned from a trip. Being very much a space fan I was thrilled and reread the book many times. &#34;Explorers&#34; was probably not the most representative Tintin adventure given the locale but it did have all the hallmarks of the Tintin adventures - great plotting, great characters, and wonderful touches of humor.<br /><br />I am pleased to report that the film version has all these hallmarks as well. After hundreds of reviews there is not much I can add but a few impressions.<br /><br />1. The feel of this film was exactly right. There was no attempt to bring it up to date and introduce 21st century technology, social issues, political concerns, strong female characters or the like. The setting looked just like its comic strip inspiration - the world of the 1930s.<br /><br />2. The animation was unbelievably realistic. If not for the cartoonish features of most of the characters one could almost think it was live action in places. One wonders how long it will be before there is no way to tell the difference.<br /><br />3. The action sequences were, as one might expect, well beyond what was depicted in the comics. This usually worked well (the crane fight was superb) but occasionally was over the top (the chase sequence in the North African city, and the sea battle between the Unicorn and the other ship where the latter goes over the former and both are afire). This was one area where modern sensibilities did intrude.<br /><br />4. The humor hit just the right note. Thomson and Thompson were great! Snowy was also well done. I regretted not seeing my favorite from &#34;Explorers on the Moon&#34;, Professor Calculus, but those are the breaks.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended. I worry that this film will be too dated looking to appeal to children but adults should definitely give it a look.k.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I didn't realize this was about addiction and alcoholism. I love Denzel, and he does an amazing job. It's not one I'll watch repeatedly, but it was a good movie.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this to attempt relaxation in this chaotic time period we are living in.  Combined with deep breathing I find it useful.  Life is not as it was intended to be.  Things are going to change really soon, read your Bible.  But as we endure the tough times now, a product like this is an asset.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Lots of my favorite stars, but I thought it was going to be funny...it's not. If anything, it's sad. I got more and more depressed watching it. The ending seemed like &#34;it's time to wrap this up,&#34; and didn't seem authentic. Oh, well!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|These are always good books.  Enticing, thought provoking, and exciting.  Of course, who doesn't love a good mystery?!  And, nice to see he's making a come back on the silver screen.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|Kept my attention until 3 or 4 in the morning. Reading the series for the third time. I love them all!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved The Rosie Project.  Don, with the social skills of a lamp post, becomes less annoying and more endearing as the story progresses.  Not a &#34;laugh out loud&#34; story but a series of smiles and chuckles.  Rosie and Don are totally improbable as a couple but they just seem to &#34;work&#34;.  I didn't want it to end!
B000089RV6|5.0|I love this album. It brings back many memories. I highly recommend to all those looking for past favorites or looking for new ones.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|additive, fun, better than the first, great new objectives and power ups! I'm definitely a fan! keep making fun games!
B00992CF6W|4.0|it alows my siblings my cousins and i to play together...the only problem is we have to be in the same wi fi zone..that really bugs us..because we dont live in the same house so we cant mine together!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very handy. I would like it to have more downloadable versions and the ability to highlight only what I want, not additional verses.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it works just fine on my kindle fire!! I can download music and videos...but in the beginning of 2012.. it started having errors constantly...but it hasnt acted up for awhile..with my luck it will screw up everything!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept my attention the whole time and was full of twists and turns. The characters have so many layers and it is extremely well written. Definitely worth it.
0810989956|4.0|My son is really into all the books of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. He can't seem to put down this book. I am very pleased with this purchase. It helps him to be creative & helps his writing skills.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|My kids are young and love any type of Disney movie. I remember watching this movie on our VHS over and over again and my wife and I jumped at the chance to see it in theaters when Disney played it at the local Cinemark. Our kids loved it so much I surprised them with this after we saw it.<br /><br />It looks great in Blu-ray and the behind the scenes provide hours of learning and fun on the making of this classic movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and hope to read more books about the mission(s) which were undertaken to eliminate Osama. I have enjoyed reading other books concerning US Military units (Force Recon Marines; SEALS; LRRPs; etc) and this book is definitely great!
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony Bennett, such a great singer,  But you have to be of a certain age to really enjoy his songs.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|I love the movie and the soundtrack only adds to the experience/feeling! Hoping to find more music created by Hans Zimmer in the future!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book was super exciting! Such an adventure! I can't wait to find out what happens in this series!! Love Lena and Ethan...
B0074AGVWK|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying Maeve Binchy books. Intending to buy more of them. They are interesting to read and quite descriptive of  the country
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|A friend got me hooked on Downton Abbey. It is about an English estate & the family who are the custodians of the it. The viewer follows the lives of the family members of the estate, as well as, the lives the staff who serve them. There are characters to love and those who are rather charm free trouble makers.
B005CMSDLE|1.0|\\"Hanna\\" is so immature it should be rated reverse \\"R\\":  Adult Guardian requires accompanying by 17 and under.  For example, the Eric Bana character sets out to hike the Arctic in only a business suit.<br /><br />The Previews cannot be skipped and go on and on - reason enough to boycott the movie.  Is \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" from 10 years ago a \\"Preview\\"?  Even worse, the \\"Preview\\" of \\"Scarface\\" is for a movie that's 30 years old !!!!!<br /><br />Isn't it nice to be manipulated and force fed studio ads, which add something that feels like 15 minutes of RT length,  Go get dinner, there's plenty of time!
B0043WDK2G|4.0|Murder mysteries are just not my genre, but I do like Castle. Nathan Fillion from Firefly is a hoot and Susan Sullivan, who plays his mother, give it a light-hearted edge.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Our family has seen every installment of this series since the original was so fresh and fantastic.  For the most part, this has been an animated anthology par excellence (if you forget some of the strong procreative/&#34;survival of the fittest&#34; tones of the 2nd). My family has sat down and watched them (the other 3) multiple times together and shared many laughs.<br /><br />This installment was great.  Perhaps as good as the original.  Characters are retained Ice Age era themes are maintained and it is a high soaring, vibrant adventure laced with layered humor (aka stuff that your kids will laugh at and stuff that mostly the parents will get).<br /><br />In relation to other animated anthologies of the last decade (or 2), Ice Age stands out as the most fresh, most original, and perhaps the best overall.
B00B935SUY|5.0|If you have ever been interested in analog recording or are a musician who records digitally, give this documentary a viewing.  Dave Grohl takes us on an interesting journey through the life of a specific music studio called Sound City located in the valley in LA. I really enjoyed the interviews conducted with various former studio engineers, assistants and previous owners. The documentary concludes with Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters recording with some very famous musicians including Macca himself (Sir Paul McCartney) at Dave's studio, now outfitted with the Neve mixing console that used to live and breathe life into some very classic music recorded at Sound City.  The documentary is as much about the Sound City studio as much as it is about the actual Neve console that used to live there.  Thumbs WAY up to Dave Grohl for a very interesting, engaging, and historical musical documentary.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Fir those if us who've known about the cruel orphanages throughout Ireland, it's nice to read a story with a happy ending.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|Gave it to my girlfriend as a present. She loved it as she is a big fan of Maynard's music (Tool, APC) she couldn't have been happier.
B0001NBMEE|5.0|DVD quality was excellent, movie was also. Husband has been looking for this one for years, one of his favorite classics.
B000002LJA|5.0|I remember hearing this when it came out on Cassette tape, I enjoyed it then, but when the tape warped I tossed it in the trash.<br />A song from this CD played a few months ago, so I bought it again. Wow the music on this CD is really good.<br />Yeah their are a few racial over tones, but the music is good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game! When I play and get really far then die, I have to play again and again to see how much further I can go!!! Love this game!!
B00009L1UP|5.0|Forgot what this gorup sounded like and how good their music really was, sometimes the old music is great to rediscover.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This show is TV that engages.  Love the concept, storyline, character development, EVERYTHING!  I love how the stories of the different fairy tales are interwoven to create a riveting tale.  You have to watch each episode in order and pay attention.  The DVD format has been a better format in which to watch the series; I missed too much watching it at its TV time.  Get this series!
B000000XB9|5.0|Got this for my wife, and she loves it. These guys had their time in the 70's but for me anyway CCR is a little bit out dated.<br />Their cool to hear on the radio from time to time, but I'm not ready to get a CD.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|More exciting then the first and a great stepping stone to the third! You definitely have me as a fan!
0788812807|5.0|When this movie first came out we went to the theatre to see it. It was precious and entertaining then it still is today.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Was a huge fan of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books but not so with this one.  Hard to keep track of the goings on and a slow read.  Put me to sleep.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Perfect watch for the price, runs very accurate. I've had it over a week and it hasn't lost a minute. The sweeping second hand is beautiful.  If anything turns sour with it, will update. Very Satisfied.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Great way to buy batteries -- Lot cheaper than in stores and in the comfort of your own home.  Will continue to buy batteries like this.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you've been wanting the H.P. collection, and you don't buy this package, you're nuts!  The movies came in a nice compact box set, and they arrived very quickly.  We've only watched 3 of the movies so far, but they play flawlessly... and did I mention the price was incredible?!?  Great seller, great price, great product!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is sucn a great sereies.  I was so sorry when seies 2 ended,  I now need to order series 3
140120841X|1.0|I do not like the comic book format. I am an adult and prefer text to pictures except where a picture is needed.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Great item, very pleased!! My Grandson loves it, He works on it as much as he can. Good solid parts and complete instructions.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|You damn right he's got the blues and this CD says it all. Just what I was looking for from Buddy, a live club scene with lots of blues and grooves to it. One of his best to date and well worth the time to listen, the intro's arent' bad either. Enjoy another romp in the club with MR. Buddy Guy!!
B008GANNIC|4.0|this is not their best, (Roots in Stereo), and it is not their worst (Angels and Serpents).  It is pretty good!
030746363X|4.0|It truly is remarkable that this actually worked for my dad and I. The only problem was continuing it. There are many solutions in this book for that too, but we did not follow them. After losing nearly 10kg's my dad relapsed and has since gained back 6. It's still a net loss of 4kgs over a whole year. His food intake choices are a lot stronger than they previously were. I have gained and lost nothing, but weight was not what I was trying to achieve (incredible sex and superhuman) of which I'm probably a little closer to than I ever was. It was an amazing trip while it lasted, and has changed the way I look at inefficiency forever.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This is still the best show on TV.  I would say this is on par with season two in terms of awesomeness but Season 1 is still the best.  Love this show and can't wait to watch more.  We need more great shows like this to make TV worth watching again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games so much<br />Because of peeta and yes I have not even read the second book but I know it's going to be good
1400052173|5.0|This is an amazing book.  My daughter's med school class had to read it.  She gave it to me.  I loved it!
B0053O89JM|5.0|A great ending to an even greater show.  I love House, and I will miss it, but this finale was the best way to say goodbye to a very great cast of characters, and a great show.
B002RVCD46|5.0|Who could say anything bad about Harry Potter?  This product was great, too.  I think we have the whole set now.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|It was a unique and interesting idea that is believable. Really good special effects, and acting. In the same category as- I Robot, or Minority report.
B005HSL626|2.0|It not a bad game but it does freeze up a lot so it makes me unsatisfied with this game
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is the altime fav. game..it challenges the mind and can be played anywhere...LOVE IT, the best games that can be plaid are the ones that require thought and use of MIND MUSCLE.
B0045DO8NI|5.0|I love this DVD and CD.  I am going to P!nk's concert and am so very excited to see her live in concert!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter is loving this game, and enjoying playing it.  She keeps working for more and more ponies with such glee.
B000Q8QHK8|4.0|excelente precio por una gran pel&iacute;cula, fue entregada en el tiempo indicado, totalmente recomendable, fue una increible oportunidad. buena compra.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie is badly paced, badly acted (a lot of over acting), badly scored (with pop songs from the era awkwardly placed)... Affleck clearly watched Scorcese's The Departed and Goodfellas as templates.  Also, there is a lot in this movie that was made-up for dramatic affect. It is watchable and there are some interesting scenes but, mostly, it is like some poorly planned history lesson that feels more off and apocryphal than anything else.  No idea why so many people a praising this movie.  Are our collective IQs and tastes dropping?
B004SIPA4G|5.0|excelente precio por una gran pel&iacute;cula, fue entregada en el tiempo indicado, totalmente recomendable, fue una increible oportunidad. buena compra.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|It's another Deadmau5 CD. As an entire album, I liked it better than 4x4=12 as a whole, but both have terrific one-off songs here and there.
B001RUXW48|5.0|Ridley Scott delivering another terrific film.  I do not not another 14 words, repeat, repeat, repeat. This is the minimum
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a story that i'm sure a lot of women can relate to, unfortunately. Nicholas Sparks does a great job incorporating suspense into this love story. Fast read. Enjoy!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|LOVE IT! It is my fave show and its even better on dvd when u can watch it on ur own time and have extras
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great book by Tom Clancy.  He has most of his actors included.  Thanks for the great reading and action.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|Too difficut for me-<br />It may be a great game, but not for me-<br />But,that is only my opinion-<br />Good luck-
B00B2166BS|4.0|Pogo chargers haven't even been released for the Nexus 7 and there won't be anything official for either the Nexus 7 or 10 for months. I'm glad that third party vendors can get out good products for new devices. Its a rare thing to find official accessories for anything other than the fashion-oriented Apple products...<br /><br />I did think this charger was pricey but its much faster than the standard charger and causes less wear and tear around the ports.<br /><br />The magnets work well; its very easy to connect and disconnect (I will say that you have to align it well for the magnets to click)<br /><br />Charge times are faster. Haven't run any tests but it definitely seems faster.<br /><br />Looks nice for a plastic charger and cool to show off.<br /><br />THANKS
0800177177|2.0|Well hmmm. You know? Yep. This movie does have some spectacularly cool moments. Don't get me wrong. I particularly liked Gary Oldman's portrayal of the infamous vampire. He made this role look almost as good as Bela Lugosi would have. I thought the cast was pretty good, although I found Lucy to be entirely annoying and was actually thrilled when she met her demise. (I don't think that's much of a spoiler, if you have read the book or seen the countless other movies, right?<br /><br />What got me about this movie and made me really rather dislike it, was that it was titled &#34;Bram Stoker's Dracula.&#34; Really? I was not aware that Bram Stoker took the liberty while writing his book of telling the forlorn tale of the Romanian Ruler Vlad Tepes. The combination of these two elements may have worked for me if the movie did not sound like it was going to be based on Bram Stoker's version. There is blood, boobs and silliness running rampant in this movie and although some may enjoy that, it just made me roll my eyes.<br /><br />In the end, I thought this was a half decent movie where the bloody love story took precedence over the actual comparison to the book it was supposedly based on.
0345803493|5.0|I was so thrilled when book 2 came. I called my daughter and told her it was here. (she bought the 1st one.) I bought the last 2
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|This is a very emotional and moving movie. I thought Russell Crowe did a fantastic job of portraying John Nash and he was very believable, especially during the institution scenes. Watching him struggle with his own demons throughout the movie was pretty amazing. This movie I wouldn't recommend for the highly adventuresome movie goer. A lot of the film is very quiet and there is a lot of dialogue. While the dialogue is interesting for those who appreciate very psychology-based plots, if you are looking for mile a minute action, this isn't it.<br /><br />I did notice that they left out a lot of important and rather commonly known elements of the real John Nash's life. I suppose this was to make the movie fit the script, but there were some things I would have liked to have seen in the film. Perhaps if the movie had gone on to describe his later years those gaps would have been filled.<br /><br />Either way, if you are interested in mathematics, mental illness or just appreciate a good movie, I think this fits the bill.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|The graphic novel definitely had a much darker &#34;look&#34; to it. The artwork of this cartoon is much more conventional. Still, this cartoon definitely captures the character of Batman at 55 YO, still crazy, and unable to sit still without violence as part of his life. The kids may be a little off-put by how dark the content is, so be warned.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I started and stopped this book several times before I was finally able to get past the first few pages. I enjoyed the story, but I absolutely hated the baby talk. An entire book told from a 5 year old's perspective drove me crazy. For that reason, I can't give it 5 stars.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|If you don't already know about this movie, know this: This cartoon (part one and two, but REALLY part two) is dark, violent, and bloody, and the politics are chilling. I think it counts as a horror movie. My kids were both troubled by it (I cured that by having them watch Adam West's Batman). Kids are going to have trouble understanding what it is that's making Superman one of the \\"bad guys\\" in this movie. I love horror movies, and I liked the graphic novel a lot, so I liked this a lot.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This one is a must for Michael Jackson fans. Very nice behind the scenes stories of his last tour. Includes his best songs too.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is so good, it was hard for me to put down. One of ny favorite nooks now!! <3
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This book was a little slow, but ended with a very unexpected twist.  Just know it is a little slow at the beginning.  Well worth the time to read!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Loved all the action, typically Clancy, however there was way too much technology info for my mind to comprehend. It was so detailed that it became easy to skip thru a lot of it.
B002TEKRQC|5.0|This is a great movie it is funny and sad at the same time. this movie is a tear jerker. one of the best dramas i've seen in a while. the story was great and so were the actors. whoopi goldberg is hilarious. she can turn a sad movie joyful and patrick swayze and demi moore were great together. this is one of the bes all time romantic movies. it it truely a classic. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B007HACDLK|5.0|Have now read all the Mitch Rapp novels by Flynn and have enjoyed each and every one. Too bad his character is fictional. Hope there are more Rapp novels to come in the near future.
B00AZ6DK10|5.0|This is a awesome movie. i love how they mixed history with myth. this was a really good movie. i especialy liked the chase between lincoln and the vampire who killed his mother. the horse scene was pretty cool. the action in this movie was awesome and so was the special effects. the actors were great and the story was cool. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I read a lot of reviews about transfer quality and things like that, but if the picture quality is good, that's usually good enough for me.  Maybe it's because I've seen these movies, especially the classic Alien, so many times that I noticed the difference, but the Blu-ray version of this film is like seeing it for the first time.  The film is shadowy, lots of darkness, and there are many shots that we've never seen clearly before.  I've never seen, or at least noticed, such a difference between a DVD and a Blu-ray disc.  That alone was worth the price of this anthology.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This is a awesome movie. i love how they mixed history with myth. this was a really good movie. i especialy liked the chase between lincoln and the vampire who killed his mother. the horse scene was pretty cool. the action in this movie was awesome and so was the special effects. the actors were great and the story was cool. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B003UESJJC|5.0|Apocalypse Now is based on a novel by Polish writer Joseph Conrad, who wrote a number of novels in English in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The film is based on Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness, which was about a river trip in West Africa to find a man named Kurtz. Both versions of Francis Ford Coppola's film, filmed in the Philippines, are based on a river trip in Vietnam to find an American soldier also named Kurtz.<br />The DVD and blu-ray both have a number of special features which explain the difficulties that occurred in the making of the film. The film went over budget and Coppola had to personally finance the continuing operation. Both versions were awarded top honors at Cannes and went on to make a profit.<br />On the blu-ray both versions are on disc one. Special features are on disc two and disc three contains a Feature-Length Documentary named Hearts of Darkness: A filmmaker's Apocalypse with commentary by Coppola's wife Eleanor.<br />Despite all the difficulties in producing the films, both rank, along with The Godfather Saga, among the greatest films of recent years.<br />For reviewers who would like to compare the film with Conrad's novel, the book Heart of Darkness is available here from Amazon vendors.

B00AGKH6D8|5.0|I just listened to the whole album.  Couldn't wait to start it over and listen again.  Awesome compilation of Jazz-Funk-Rock.  I've listened to everything Joe has been involved with, and I was wondering how this would turn out.  I am not disappointed.  In my opinion this is and will be a very successful undertaking by this group of top musicians.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Few books like this are a true picture of the person.  This book however is.  I feel as if I knew him.  We have both experienced evil in life and overcome it.  We have both experienced marriage and children.  We shared the same thoughts, fears and emotions.<br /><br />He tells the story honestly and his wife's views in the story just add to the whole book being honest.  What an amazing story.
B001C4CI8U|2.0|The hinges on the inside of the case were broken. I kept it anyway because I wanted to view the first season of Fringe immediately.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|it is a really good game with lots of puzzles and mini games to keep u busy and the story is really well thought of and executed so it is worth all of the time u put into it

0062127241|3.0|I was hoping for the definitive story of Pete's career, both Who and post-Who, but came away disappointed. I've read 3-4 Who books in the past but none from Pete's perspective. This book is more about his personal life, and frankly, Who cares? I don't. I wanted to learn in depth about the recording sessions, the tours, his relationships with the band members. Instead, those subjects are run through quickly {while he's away} while long passages drone on about his wife, his girlfriends, the bands managers, advisers etc. What did Pete think of the iconic Who's Next album cover? \\"I didn't like it\\". Keith Moon's death? Summed up in one sentence-\\"Roger called and said 'He's done it'. This from a guy that claims to have kept journals since he was a kid! These are the best recollections he can come up with? And if I read one more word about the long-unrealised Lighthouse project I'll puke. Pete and the Who are my #2 all-time behind the Beatles, and I rate him as #1 among songwriters, better than Lennon or McCartney together or separate. Too bad his book writing skills don't measure up. And Pete, I still don't buy the kiddie porn explanation.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|This article is very nice for the price I pay is very worth, is a product made of plastic is not a first quaity but for the price is fear.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Interesting subject matter and the style is engaging and literary.  Some vivid stuff of clergy abuse (but not sexual).  Positive and hopeful though. Good character development
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent book! I did not want to put It down. Couldn't wait for the movie either AND I've already seen it twice
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is a digital jigsaw puzzle. It gives many different pictures to choose from. Some are free and some you need to purchase. It is ok but doing an actual jigsaw puzzle from a box is much more satisfying.
1845761502|5.0|This is a tribute to the ingenuity of Stan Winston and his studio. Actually, I prefer the mechanical effects, they seemed to ADD something to the movies. Now, it's CGI afer CGI, there's not even a storyline...
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this game is scary as heck!!!! it is really worth the money plz make a chapter2 also love the update

B000ATQYT2|5.0|A family including, Grandmother, Mother, Children, and Grandchildren have watched this DVD so often that we fear we may wear it out.  Therefore, this is my 2nd DVD purchase of the Muppet Christmas Carol.  What  I like most about the DVD is the music.  The story, of course, is familiar, but the muppet caracters bring in a new twist.  Is it worth the money?  Definitely, YES!

B008JFUTT0|5.0|\\"To Whom it May Concern\\"-Coming from reality. 1972.<br /><br />America lost a poet when they ignored Rodriguez. It is a \\"Cold Fact\\".<br /><br />My question is why? Why could they not see this great artist and man.<br /><br />We in South Africa thought he was a superstar.<br /><br />Then he disappeared. The Oscar nominated documentary 'searching for Sugarman' opened my eyes to why.<br /><br />People thought he had killed himself after being humiliated in the USA. Why was he ignored? \\"I wonder?

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|My husband purchased this set for me for Christmas.. it is awesome, just awesome!!! I particularly liked inserting the screwdriver into the &#34;walker's&#34; eyeball ;) He has a special place on my mantle and is quite a conversation piece. A MUST for any Walking Dead fan, this was by far my favorite gift of the year!!
1419705849|5.0|My daughter owns all the books in this series.  She has read them all aloud to me and as usual, this one is good.  There are lots of laugh out loud moments and it's a quick and easy read.  If you like other Wimpy Kid books, you'll like this one too.
B000ME5B30|5.0|This was a great, honest, humble presentation done by Al Gore. It's unfortunate that so many are willing to throw all of the scientific evidence out of the window in blind allegiance to a skewed political party.
B004E0Z4W6|5.0|The cd is better than Cannival. I thought it was just another live remake of the Cannival. The music really moves and it has a flair to it. Excellent CD !!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It has amazing graphics and never freezes up on me. Although it is hard to earn gems, i would save all your gems don`t waste them on the asignments.

034580404X|5.0|good books to have in your book collection
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Well developed characters. The plot struck me as something so real and terrifying.  Women who end up in abusive relationships probably shouldn't read this. Nor should anyone who doesn't like negative real life situations.  The book held my attention and I hope I learned to spot the sociopaths and there victims; if ever the victim should need help.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game very addicting can't put it down can spend hours playing I would recommend it to everyone out thete

B000001GPX|4.0|These are certainly solid performances of the Beethoven Fifth and Seventh Symphonies, particularly the former. Whether I'd go so far as to dub them the finest available for each is another matter. Certainly that's been the dominant take on the pair for a number of years, but in repertoire that's been recorded as often as these two works have, the term \\"best\\" is itself best thought of in perhaps group rather than individual terms. I'd certainly rate the rendition of the Fifth to be among the best I've heard on record, others being Solti's Vienna Philharmonic version from the late 1950s and Karajan's with the Berlin Philharmonic from the early 1960s. Kleiber's Seventh, on the other hand, is good but still rather farther down on my list, which is headed by the likes of Kubelik's with Vienna Philharmonic, the late 50s Solti with the same orchestra and Karajan, once again from his early 60s cycle. Again, both performances are very good, but the Fifth is the real star of this duo.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|\\"Mama\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Five years ago, sisters Victoria and Lilly vanished from their suburban neighborhood without a trace. Since then, their Uncle Lucas and his girlfriend, Annabel have been madly searching for them. But when, incredibly, the kids are found alive in a decrepit cabin, the couple wonders if the girls are the only guests they have welcomed into their home. As Annabel tries to introduce the children to a normal life, she grows convinced of an evil presence in their house. Are the sisters experiencing traumatic stress, or is a ghost coming to visit them? How did the broken girls survive those years all alone? As she answers these disturbing questions, the new mother will find that the whispers she hears at bedtime are coming from the lips of a deadly presence.<br /><br />The cast led by Jessica Chastain (as Annabel) & Nikolaj Coster-Wadlau (as Lucas / Jeffrey) is great. The directing by Andres Muschietti (who also wrote the story & screenplay) is great. The story by Andres Muschietti & Barbara Muschietti (who also produced and co-wrote the screenplay) & the screenplay by Andres Muschietti & Barbara Muschietti & Neil Cross is great.<br /><br />The music by Fernando Velazquez is great. The cinematography by Antonio Riestra is great. The film editing by Michele Conroy is great. The casting by Robin D. Cook is great. The production design by Anastasia Masaro is great. The art direction by Elis Lam is great. The set decoration by Patricia Cuccia, set designs by Aleksandra Marinkovich is great. The costume design by Luis Sequeira is great. The special effects coordinated by Warren Appleby, supervised by John MacGillivray is great. The visual effects coordinated by Nick Colangelo & Naomi Foakes, supervised by Joan Amer, David Heras, Edward Taylor IV & Aaron Weintraub is great. The special make-up effects by David Marti, Montse Ribe, Jordi Morera, Raquel Munuera & Pablo Perona Navarro is great.<br /><br />This is a great horror movie thatis different and entertaining. It is also a well-made and well-crafted chiller, as well. Jessica Chastain is great and nearly unrecognizable as Annabel. This is also an interesting supernatural thriller that was executive produced by Guillermo del Toro, a filmmaker known for his supernatural roots in film.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|It's always interesting to learn about the life of a famous and unique director such as Alfred Hitchcock. His movies were so ahead of their time and so original. I still remember seeing Psycho for the first time. It was on late night TV and I was still a kid. Without showing any gore, it scarred the hell out of me. It was also very interesting to me how big of role his wife played in all of his films. You know the old saying. Behind every great man there is a woman. In this case it is true. I think it's very hard for somebody to play Hitchcock but Anthony Hopkins did a good job and got Hitchcock's mannerisms down and Helen Mirren was brilliant as usual. The rest of the cast did a good job too. I really enjoyed the movie but I think that you need to be interested in Hitchcock to really enjoy this film.

B000002HPT|4.0|Falling Into Infinity is a good CD but not as good as the older Dream Theater material. I'd like to give this a 3.5 star but I will give DT the benefit of the doubt as they are one of my favorite bands.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|I gave this to my brother for a gift. He love's it...the quality is super and the price was great. He is not left handed but did not mind the buttons on the other side. He has a large wrist and it still fit perfect.

B008X6N1OA|4.0|If you are a fan of the Ice Age movie series, then you probably know what to expect here. I held off on purchasing this movie, based on negative reviews. After renting the movie and watching it myself, I find this to be a perfectly good sequel. - Is it as good as the 1st or even 2nd film? No. I don't think so; however, it is still very entertaining and fun to watch. If you have kids, I am certain they will enjoy it. There are a few cheesy moments and some not so surprising plot turns, the whole pirate theme thing and a few small annoyances with the dialogue, yet I still felt 4 stars, to say &#34;I like it&#34; is a more fair rating than 3 stars, for just &#34;okay&#34; for this 4th installment to the franchise. Worth a look and even  purchase, in my opinion.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Very original movie. Exciting premise that explores what our minds could be capable of. Interesting mix of thriller, sci-fi, and some comedy. Good sound track.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very well-written script, perfect casting, impeccable costumes.  All the different storylines keep you anxious to watch more.  The writing, the actors, the settings all make it seem so real.  I watched the entire series (all three) in 2 week-ends and can't wait for the next one!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is a must read for all those in leadership positions.  There is always that one person that you just don't get. Extroverts must know these things about the  very small minority of staff members who don't want to lead, but are the best kept secret of many successful leaders, including that many of them are introverts.  Introverts need to understand just how different they are and why extroverts may not &#34;get&#34; you.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I really didn't like the game, first off when you run out of coins or diamonds you have to pay for more with real money!!! Then before I realised I had to pay, ads keep popping up asking to rate the game. I do like the graphics in this game, the quests are reasonable too. But this game was just annoying after some time.

B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|Very solid album by Helloween. Title track and 'Burning Sun' have great energy and fabulous dual lead guitar work. Andy Deris vocals really fit the music. It's German power metal by a band that is still on their game.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Bad ending, filthy language adequate writing.  I think that the only reason this one is on the best seller list is due to the money the publisher poured into the advertising.
B006VRDZ44|4.0|This is a top notch series with each character having a complex personality.  The costumes and sets are wonderful as well.  My only problem is with some pretty graphic violence, but otherwise this is one of the best series I've ever watched.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|These sound really good. Good warm tones with just the right amount of bass. Sounds very well balanced in all respects. They are comfortable. They seem a little big for me because they dont fit snug on my adult head. They are no longer made in Austria as the picture would lead you to believe. That might not mean much but these phones were in the running with a few other great phones and where they were made was the tie breaker for me. Finding a made in china sticker on them was dissapointing. But so far so good.
B008DK3QBY|5.0|Barenboim was at his best when he recorded for EMI early in his career.  His renditions of the Mozart and Beethoven Piano Concertos, as well as his chamber-music collaborations with du Pr&eacute; and Zukerman, from that time (1965-1970) have always struck me as among the finest ever accounts of standard pianistic repertoire.  So, too, are his renditions of Beethoven's 32 Sonatas--the so-called &#34;New Testament&#34; of piano literature (the OT being Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier).  This is feisty, youthful Beethoven, and none the worse for that.  I appreciate this approach even in the more exalted, late works, which receive appropriately thoughtful, if somewhat romanticized accounts here, with plenty of *Sturm und Drang* to leaven the mysticism.  At times in the later works I was reminded of past masters such as Egon Petri or Myra Hess (to implicate two very unlikely suspects).  In the early and middle-period works, Barenboim's spontaneous combustion keeps the music from ever sounding routine; no phrase is taken for granted, and each is lovingly and creatively sculpted.  Throughout, Barenboim's rich tone and sparkling treble register  (beautifully captured by EMI's engineers) make this one of the most ear-pleasing, indeed sensuously beautiful Beethoven cycles of the stereo era.  The occasional smudged passagework or uneven trill reminds the listener not of any technical liabilities on Barenboim's part, but of the long takes -- perhaps even entire movements -- that afford a simulacrum of live performance throughout the cycle. Some listeners may resist some of Barenboim's controversial interpretive choices, some of which may well have been decided on the spur of the moment, such as the application of noticeable rubato and other tempo modifications within a movement, or occasional extremes of tempo (at both ends of the spectrum).  Despite these minor caveats, however, this could conceivably be a first choice for neophyte collectors on the lookout for an inexpensive Beethoven cycle. One could  then go on to obtain more historically significant cycles by the likes of Schnabel, Kempff, Backhaus or Brendel (Vox is best) for comparison and contrast.  My only criticism of this latest reissue of Barenboim's first (and better) Beethoven cycle is that the booklet has omitted the superb and detailed annotations of the previous edition in favor of skimpy and generalized comments.  No matter; this one is a winner!cycle.

I cut the recipe in half and baked just the one loaf and it was so good out of the oven - mouth watering.  After years of toiling away with a dough hook and mixer and coming up with mediocre bread, this book and Ken's instructions really did the trick. Can't wait to try the foccacia and pizza dough. I like good hearty breads so next time I will experiment with some seeds and whole wheat flour.

B004L35GAQ|1.0|This is by far the worst cd that I have EVER purchased. There is only one song on here even worth listening to, Sail. The rest of the album is mediocre at best. What came to my mind after suffering through the rest of the album is; &#34;Are they attempting to channel Freddy Mercury?&#34;
B009Z5BPZK|3.0|It's like that old joke, two women are at dinner at a restaurant and one says to the other, &#34;This food is terrible!&#34; The other woman wrinkles her nose and replies, &#34;I know! And the portions are so small!&#34;<br /><br />Unfortunately, in the case of season six of Gossip Girl, the episodes are bad and few. Ten episodes could have been sufficient to wrap everything up quite nicely. Everything, for the most part, is wrapped up, but NOT nicely.<br /><br />***Here There Be Spoilers***<br /><br />I am a Chuck and Blair fan, have been all the way from the first season. Yes, they've done heinous things to each other. (that whole bit about Chuck setting up Blair to prostitute herself for his hotel in the third season was hard to stomach) Even at their worst, though, these two are compelling. They set the screen on fire when they're together. This season finds them involved in a pact to succeed in their respective business fields...Chuck by ousting his father from Bass Industries and Blair by making a name for herself as the new head of Waldorf Designs. Once they accomplish these goals, they will be together. Their chemistry appears briefly at the beginning of season but is almost non existent by the end, and even though they end up married (yay!) with a darling little mini-Chuck in the last episode, I couldn't help but feel dissatisfied with it.<br /><br />Part of it could be how anti climactic the resolution for the pact was, on both sides. Blair creates a line of couture uniforms for high school girls that becomes wildly popular after a series of missteps, caused mostly by her childish scheming. Chuck is at odds with his evil father, who threatens the people Chuck cares about and even makes an attempt on Chuck's life. All of this culminates in Chuck's father doing a nosedive off the top of a building after trying to take a swing at his son and Chuck stepping out of the way. There's a fracas with the police that ultimately ends up with Bart's death being declared an accident.<br /><br />After all that fuss, it seems a ridiculous death, akin to Bart choking to death on a Big Mac or being run over by a bus. Vendettas deserve truly dramatic endings, like Chuck finishing his father off mobster style or Bart getting stabbed by say, Lily.<br /><br />The identity of Gossip Girl is revealed and she's...Dan! That sound you hear is a thousand Gossip Girl fans scratching their heads in confusion. In what I consider an ironic twist, once the cat is out of the bag, some of the characters offer up who they thought GG was and every guess...Dorota, Eric, Jenny and Georgina...seems a way better choice than Dan. Dan talks about how he didn't just want to be on the outside looking in and how he thought he could &#34;write&#34; himself into the Upper East Side by becoming GG. And then there's some frustrating crap about how GG was always &#34;moral&#34;...Yeah, right. The most enjoyable aspect of the GG reveal is a delightful cameo by Kristen Bell, who has narrated Gossip Girl for all six seasons.<br /><br />Dan and Serina end up married by the end of the series too but their union feels as dissatisfying as Chuck and Blair's. After all, Dan has spent most of season six by being a perfect arse to deserving and undeserving alike. It's hard to sympathize with his plight, especially as he systematically sells out the people he spends most of the season freeloading off of. Personally, I would've liked to see Serina end up with Nate. (Poor Nate! Dreadfully underutilized and always given the worst storylines)<br /><br />For those that were waiting with baited breath for the return of Eric, Jenny and Vanessa, they all get less than 30 seconds of screen time between them. Lily ends up with William, which in a weird way kind of works because, let's face it, Lily's so dumb she deserves him, and Rufus ends up with Lisa Loeb.<br /><br />***Spoilers End***<br /><br />Gossip Girl used to be a good show that you watched for the drama and intrigue, and because it's so darn pretty to look at. Somewhere along the way, the drama became a bit stale and certain things really were noticeably bothersome. As another reviewer pointed out, how ridiculous is it that none of the main characters saw fit to graduate from college yet they all have high-income occupations? Preposterous! They could've had at least one of them graduate. Also, how many times can characters keep making the same mistakes? (I know, I know...in the millions but you have to make SOME effort to keep it fresh. Why make Serina look terrible by always having her choose the worst possible man at any given time to sleep with?)<br /><br />Why did I give it three stars? At the end of the day, there was still enough in the sixth season to hold my attention, even if I did roll my eyes more than a few times. And the show is still pretty to look at. And even if I quibble about the execution, they did wrap things up. Recommended for Gossip Girl fans who want things wrapped up.

B0018QCXGY|1.0|When my city is attacked by a giant monster, and the way out is destroyed I don't think I'm going to waste my time carrying around a video camera!!  Then again, this camera is apparently the most advanced thing ever made.  Consider,<br /><br />* The battery lasted at least 12 hours (it was a party at the start and daylight at the end) of constant taping with no problem.<br />* This camera can survive numerous attacks by mean things, take boulders collapsing and never gets scratched!<br />* This camera is so important that the yuppies don't dare part with it.<br /><br />And yet, with all the advanced power of the camera it doesn't have video stabilization!!<br /><br />Beyond the remarkable camera, there are the characters.  Rob is really, really stupid deciding that he can dodge a giant monster to find his girlfriend.  The women characters just scream and bleed.  The dude holding the camera is well...just there to hold the camera.<br /><br />The reality is this is a really bad movie.  The blair-witch camera ruins the film because you spend the entire time wondering why these idiots would continue hold and record while their city is being stepped on.

B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book is such a dragger. The two main characters are truly Hopeless!<br />Need to read more than 70% of the book to get into the actual story line.!
B000H305U0|5.0|I had originally purchased Justin Timberland's CD - in 2007 and a person who I let live with me, took the CD plus other CD's were missing.  So Glad, I found this CD.  Plus the Price was Great.
1594487154|5.0|My Review<br /><br />Before I begin I will state that this is an overview of my thoughts. I have been blogging and dissecting the book in greater detail on my blog by infusing my thoughts, questions, and ideas. You can access these blog posts in the sidebar of my blog - [...]<br /><br />This review is to go over the general thoughts of the book. When I started reading the book I found it slow and not real intriguing. However, I have read all of his other works and think he is groundbreaking with his research and concepts. Once I got about 40-50 pages into the book I was hooked.<br /><br />I read this book right after reading Susan Cain's book Quiet. IT was a good mix as Dan Pink discussed ambiverts so I was able to connect with what I had just read. Like previous books by Pink he creates a very intriguing look at an idea(in this case we are all salesmen) and breaks it down into research and stories. He structure is easy to understand, but enough facts to keep the heavy hitters happy.<br /><br />Once gain Dan Pink has written a book that I will reference and utilize in my daily work as a teacher, parent, and spouse. I have several pages bookmarked, highlighted, and locked into my brain to think about and investigate further.<br /><br />Dan Pink does not let us down with his latest book and should be another MUST READ of the year!
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Does not follow the book AT ALL!!!! I felt like it RUSHED through and skipped so many amazing and important pieces of the book. I will definitely read the book's author's other books and I hope that if they turn another on into a movie, it does better justice than this movie did!
0307352153|5.0|My Review<br /><br />I have been blogging about this book by breaking down all my highlights and underlines to really discuss this book in greater detail. All of these insights are on my blog -<br />[...]<br /><br />This post is just a review. I am not going to go into my thoughts and the specific facts and ideas of the book. Rather I am reviewing it as a whole.<br /><br />Overall, this is a MUST READ! It is important for people to understand introverts. It is beyond being shy or socially awkward. There are many misconceptions about being an introvert as is there are many misconceptions about many things in our world today. This book helps to break down the information and explain the world of introverts and how they fit into our American society that strives on being an extrovert.<br /><br />This book was an important read for me personally as it helped me to understand myself a bit more clearly. It was vital for me as an educator to remember how different people respond and react to situations in life. It was important that as an educator I meet their needs as well. It was vital for me as a parent as I have children at both ends of the verts - introvert and extravert.<br /><br />The book flows very well. There are a ton of research studies shared and discussed. There were a few spots that I glossed over as I just did not see the need to spend time on the issues being discussed. However, 90% of the book was very solid and I marked my book up with so many notes, thoughts, and highlights.<br /><br />This is probably one of the most important reads I have read in the past 5 years. If you have not read it, please do and let it lead to some reflecting and discussions with others.

0316069434|4.0|I read my first Harry Bosch book by Michael Connelly with the reading of the latest novel in the series, Black Box.<br /><br />And I really enjoyed the book.<br /><br />Here is quick overview from Amazon.com<br /><br />In a case that spans 20 years, Harry Bosch links the bullet from a recent crime to a file from 1992, the killing of a young female photographer during the L.A. riots. Harry originally investigated the murder, but it was then handed off to the Riot Crimes Task Force and never solved.<br /><br />Now Bosch's ballistics match indicates that her death was not random violence, but something more personal, and connected to a deeper intrigue. Like an investigator combing through the wreckage after a plane crash, Bosch searches for the \\"black box,\\" the one piece of evidence that will pull the case together.<br /><br />Riveting and relentlessly paced, THE BLACK BOX leads Harry Bosch, \\"one of the greats of crime fiction\\" (New York Daily News), into one of his most fraught and perilous cases.<br /><br />This is the 19th book in the Harry Bosch series. What I like about this series is that it is real time. Michael Connelly has aged and created this world in real time where each book ages one year at a time. I had the privilege of meeting Michael Connelly as part of the Sony VIP Book Club and it was very interesting to hear him speak about his writing and these characters. You can read about my thoughts on my personal blog.<br /><br />Back to the book. This book held my interest. There was an interesting case. Along with the case I felt compelled to learn more about the characters. I wanted to know more about the story of their lives. Despite jumping into the series very late I did not feel left out. I was able to connect with Harry right away. The two plots were interesting and I read this book very quickly. I have not read a book this quick in quite some time. I am not a crime book reader. This is not my genre. However, I would like to go back and read the rest of the books in the series.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good crime story with a cop with a flawed past, then this is for you. He does not bring in unnecessary facts. He writes about what is needed to know and takes you on a journey with a character that you can't help but like despite the flaws.f the books in the series.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good crime story with a cop with a flawed past, then this is for you.

B00B2DSK06|5.0|I remembered the days playing 8-bit video games. Very nostalgic. The characters are well played and the cameos of different video game characters is so awesome! I wished Super Mario had a cameo though.
B005PK56TA|5.0|One of my favorite shows. A great way to catch up on past episodes. I can't wait to see how the story continues next year.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game, its a stress reliever for me when  I need quiet time.<br />I would  recommend this game to all of my facebook friends.

0374275637|4.0|Enough here have echoed the gist of Kahneman's noteworthy book.<br /><br />I will restrict my remarks to the field of behaviorism and its limits. In a word, when a behaviorist - and Kahneman is the behaviorist's behaviorist - gets through with humanity, there's no human left.<br /><br />The value that behaviorists have to offer - and it shouldn't be discounted - is in understanding how the herd moves. For those of us who address large audiences through various media, the behaviorists have much to offer. Everyday, we are confronted with people who behave in the ways that Kahneman describes, whether it's expressing a biased, making a bad bet based on a flawed prediction, or letting their emotions lead them like an ox with a ring through its nose.<br /><br />But what really gets me about the behaviorists is that by the time they're through with all their tests on improbable scenarios built on false choices, there's not an ounce of human left in humanity. Kahneman does recognize \\"caring for people often takes the form of concern for the quality of their story, not for their feelings,\\" but it seems to me it was said a lot better by the poet who wrote to the effect that aside from the stories we create to define ourselves, we eat, sleep, and procreate.<br /><br />But where behaviorism fails - and it's a fundamental shortcoming - is exploring root causes of our behavior and  how our mind works. Behavior patterns are manifestations of root causes. There are other disciplines that explore root causes of our behavior and, for one, I find them far more rewarding.<br /><br />Behaviorism also fails - or so it seems to me - when it tries to impose its macro findings on individual behavior. Thankfully, Kahneman only does this in the last few chapters, in which I found little value.<br /><br />That said, the slog through Kahneman's book was worthwhile. I took copious notes and will revisit it sometime  after I renew my relationship with fellow man.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great book...keeps me entertained!!!recommending it to all bookworms out there! now i really wanted to see the movie,and oh,i need to read the rest of the trilogy as well!
B003YUQ9L2|4.0|I bought my first pair of Crocs a year ago and loved them. This is my second pair, and they have been great too.  Crocs may be my new go-to brand for shoes.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|This a favorite!  The love story is amazing and the history fascinating -- even if the story may be a composite of actual or possible events -- in addition to a story with great writing including an UNFORGETTABLE final courtroom scene!... FABULOUS!  Jody Foster and Richard Gere -- perfect together in this.  If only more movies had stories and acting and settings like this one! It is one of the few endings of its kind I can tolerate because it is based on strength of character.  A must see.
0552152145|5.0|Listening to this book being read by the author adds an additional dimension to the enjoyment.  You can hear undertones in Mr. Bryson's voice where he clearly finds certain parts very funny or quite serious.  I have read the book several times and always find it enjoyable.  Listening to the book in the author's own words is an added treat.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book kept me captivated. I had heard about it from a friend and she was right, I couldn't put the book down!
B004TL3R24|5.0|fits my tripod perfectly and certainly makes it much easier to carry the tripod around on photo shoots with me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season! LOVE IT!!!! Always great video quality on our favorite shows when we watch them on Amazon :) Highly recommend this show!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I was disappointed to realize that I knew exactly what would happen from the get-go.  It's not terrible, but if you're a fan of this kind of movie then there are no surprises.
1616550414|5.0|The book is exactly as describes, it looks great, the price is fair, and it will keep any Zelda fan occupied for hours reading and looking through all of the material
B008M7JODC|4.0|I was a fan of X-Files, so I was a bit skeptical to start watching this.  It's fun and quirky and definitely fills the void.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This series was amazing and very well written with a surprise in every chapter! I really enjoyed this series and recommend it to any one who is okay with mild violence and cursing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing!! This is an amazing app I would highly suggest you download this app if you liked the first one!!!
1607066017|5.0|I had read links to glowing reviews on reddit, and on a whim picked it up.  The reviews did not do this title justice.  The artwork is impeccable, the story is wholy original and captivating, and I just couldn't put it down till I read it cover to cover.
B000067FP8|4.0|Movie was in good shape, but the part that holds the dvd in the box was cracked. The dvd has a scratch on it from that, but still works. Thank you.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|At this point you can bank on AMC original series being fantastically well done.  Solid writing, excellent acting, great directing are all hallmarks of shows like Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and Hell on Wheels.  Season Five is no exception.<br /><br />If buying this I would suggest you get three day delivery so you can take your suit to the dry cleaners and go stock up on bourbon.  Then suit up, make an old fashion (there are tutorials online if you don't know how) and sit back and enjoy.  Alternatively, if you are buying the new season of Breaking Bad along with this one - I would suggest getting in a bright yellow jump suit and cooking something.  Preferably not drugs.  'Cause drugs are bad.  Maybe brownies.  Brownies aren't bad.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I received my movie exactly how it was stated. Movie was in good shape. Box was a little worn out, but stated that in the description. Thank you!
B009YQJ322|5.0|Karl Urban does a fantastic job capturing the gritty, unrelenting paragon of tyrannic justice that we have all loved from the pages of 2000AD for 35 some years.<br /><br />If you want a good grim & gritty sci-fi cop movie then you should love Dredd, even if you aren't familiar with the comic book.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I'm not fond of this type of book.  I thought it would be a fun read but couldn't get past the first part of the story and the graphic descriptions of gross hangovers.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|A fun application for children and adults alike.  Various levels and goals to achieve...then you get to enhance your restaurant to make it easier to achieve said levels and goals.  I believe it cost $0.99.  It is worth that...would I pay more?...Probably not.  Still as I said before it is fun and mindless.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and thought the story was well written and very touching.  It was a very sad story with a good ending.

B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This epic film recounts one family's struggle to survive the massive tsunami coming out of the Indian Ocean in 2004, striking the luxurious beach front resorts of Thailand and into the inland areas. A Spanish production under the direction of Juan Antonio Bayona with a script from Sergio G. Sanchez, the real-life Spanish family is replaced by one from Britain headed by Henry (Ewan McGregor) and Maria (Naomi Watts).<br /><br />They and their 3 boys, ranging in age from about 4 to 13, are swept up in the giant waves that hit the country the day after Christmas. Maria and the oldest boy Lucas (Tom Holland) are literally thrown together as the water takes them deep into the interior. The film follows them after the impact of the wave.<br /><br />Speaking of the wave. This is one of the most dramatic and authentic disaster scenes I can remember. Yes, the thunderous wave hitting the resort is a marvelous example of what talented filmmakers can do, but the underwater shots of Lucas and his mother being tossed about along with bicycles, cars and furniture is indeed frightening and realistic. The story essentially shows the survival skills of an injured Maria (a non-practicing M.D.) and Lucas. Another follows Henry and the 2 younger boys (Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast) as they look for the rest of their family.<br /><br />The performances are wonderful from everyone involved. McGregor has never been better as the rational but determined husband and father. I would hope Oscar would give some attention to Ms. Watts. In a performance that reminded me of John Hawkes in \\"The Sessions,\\" Watts must perform for the most part, laid out on a gurney or hospital bed. Her emotions and despair come from her facial expressions and her eyes. In a year filled with great performances from young actors, I would include Holland as the kid about to make a big leap toward manhood. I think most people will identify with Lucas while watching this film, hoping you would act like him or hope to have a child with his courage and conviction.<br /><br />While impossible to keep tears at bay (even without some of the swelling violins), I found the film to be ultimately uplifting and enormously spellbinding. While I wouldn't expect a commercial film like this to necessarily focus on the more than a quarter million citizens killed, I did think a footnote at the end of the film would have been appropriate to highlight the severity of this tragedy.<br /><br />The Blu ray version has a 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Audio options include a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  Subtitles are available for English (SDH) and Spanish.have a child with his courage and conviction.<br /><br />While impossible to keep tears at bay (even without some of the swelling violins), I found the film to be ultimately uplifting and enormously spellbinding.

0446580848|3.0|I am a long-time DeMille fan, having read just about all of his novels and shorts.  As such, I was looking forward to his latest novel, The Panther.  In general, the Panther was disappointing.  It had a threadbare plot and it seriously lacked any action.  The commentary went on and on, seeming to build up to crises, but they just never happened.  The wit of DeMille (as John Corey)came through loud and clear, and I thoroughly enjoyed that, but that is pretty much all that kept me reading.  The book's characters rested on stereotypes.  There was little character development.  And, it was grindingly predictable.  All in all, a so-so book that was, in general, disappointing. Very funny, though.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I love this game! It's a fun way to pass time if your bored. I think you should probaly get it :D
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Just watched episodes IV & V.  Love it.  Going to watch VI this weekend.  Good quality blu-ray and sound.  (Even though Spielberg mixed the orchestra loud for effect)  Buy it you will.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is o.k..it's not ALWAYS spot on, but it gives me a general idea as to how to dress my kids for the school day and I don't have to watch everyone else's weather on tv to get MY local on the 8's. I just reach over and get my Kindle and my weather for the day.
B007NG93CK|5.0|A good book. Typical of Kathy Reichs, but a little different to her earlier books. It is more modern day happenings then in the past.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game over & over again.  I really get a kick out of it.  I like the fast moving cards & its really cool when you win you never which will fancy automated display of moving cards will appear.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I heard this CD while I was working and absolutely loved the songs and the singers who have beautiful voices. Service was fast. Highly recommended.
030758836X|5.0|This was a very twist and turn kind of read and I liked it. Took me quite a few chapters for it to grab me so my advice is to not give up on it because it gets good-really good! The only bummer I had about it was I already knew the ending because I accidentally overheard a conversation about it. I think if I hadn't known the ending I would have had more surprises throughout the book but regardless it was still a fantastic psychological read. Look forward to reading more by this author.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it fooled me to I liv its.<br />its. so relaxing to play. no stress. more coins are needed.try it and see.
B000005HFH|5.0|baker's playing was recommended to me by friends. glad i made the purchase. am still looking for the thad jones mel lewis quartet cd.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I hate to watch him sing but I really do like his voice. I think this album was a really good choice to buy.
B008B37CB8|5.0|I owned this album in the late '60's when I thought it seemed extremely outrageous.  I hadn't heard it for decades and decided to replace it with this.  I'm surprised how toned-down it seems today but good from the nostalgia point of view.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love Lindsey Stirlings music! absolotely electric! and is amazing I would recommend to anyone this album is definetely worth the price!!
0316069434|5.0|I read this book in two days to the novice reader, give connelly's books a good 3 chapter read through before you give up, this book took a lot of thought to get the specifics down in writing, from the wars of desert storm, kuwait,  etc., what the war did to our solders thinking and behavior, the r and r on this ship mentioned in the book was a  hyprocity i hope  the ship was a fantasy, the princess ship i hope does not exist,  the ultimate corruption in our law enforcement, at it's best, better than that the reminder of the street riots in California, how some of the guns may have gotten to the  states, became very real to the reader, read this book the library has it on loan, it is a 7 day book I read it in two days, I could not put it down, then our friend, Harry Bosch at his best, the book should  be made into a movie, lots of angles to put on the screen, he detective could be Tommy Lee Jones
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This is a fun game to play when you're in the doctor's off ice waiting for an hour.  I wouldn't buy it, but it's fun.
0966638328|4.0|as an average Desktop publisher i use the built in schemes<br />in my software more often that consulting a book like this.<br /><br />i was impressed that it is excellent for what i says it is and does however!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I started reading this book the same week he was killed in Glen Rose. I cannot put into words my respect for this man and his fellow warriors of all service branches<br />This book is very well written and gives the reader an excellent view of what these men went through. It also gives his widow 's perspective of his deployments and her struggles at home with their children.<br />I felt almost an obligation to him to complete this book, I will see that both my children read it as well.<br />God bless his family
1863514260|2.0|Pretty book. Well made. Nice paper. Too bad the editing errors didn't get fixed.<br /><br />Color wheels stitched in the thread color range in the form of flower petals, 6 petals per range, 6 colors per petal with corresponding DMC skein numbers. The very first color wheel-Coral Red-(page 62) is in error. The thread key numbers are a match for the petals called \\"Shades from the DMC chart to use for light and shadow\\" on page 53. Might as well buy a DMC thread chart and make your own color wheels since these won't help you.<br /><br />I did get a laugh on page 148 where one of the iris petals didn't get numbered and the proofreader's comment was printed--no directions for the unnumbered petal.<br /><br />The best piece of advice the book offers is to use 2 light colors, 2 mid tones, 2 shade colors. If you can't get all 6 into a space, start with a mid tone, then highlight, and then a smidgen of dark so you get the value contrast. But then, we all learned that in elementary school.<br /><br />Confidence level for the accuracy of the text=0.
B001OGPTZ0|5.0|Love Stone Temple Pilots, and LOVE this album! Of course, if you're a fan you already know how amazing it is.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was kinda over this book in the beginning. It was really slow until about a third of the way through. After that I thought it was hilarious and I now love Tina fey.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Simple, clear, easy to read.  Reading this before starting to type will save you some work/revision and help you produce a better product.  It is also free so that is very cool.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE THE SHOW!  AMAZON PRIME STREAMING IS FLAWLESS! Now to only have to wait a year for the release of Downtown Abbey Season 4.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|A musical delight...<br />I loved the music and hearing Adele talk about why the songs were written.  It brought a total different feeling to the music.  I ended up watching the concert two times within a week and listen to the CD with a different feeling than I had before watching the DVD.  The concert was FAB-U-LOUS and made me more of a fan of Adele's than I was before.
B0096YJDNQ|4.0|Love th  app, I have several other planetarium apps, this I  good one, not the best, but good.<br />Night vision mode and related pointing circles would get it a higher review

0062101897|5.0|A wonderful 'walk' back through the creation of Harry's world. Even the family member who was not a \\"harry addict\\" enjoyed it.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|You look at her, you remember her on the set of Ally McBeal.  You think of her as lucky, probably vain and egotistical, everything she ever wanted she got.  What you learn is the high price she had to pay, of years of loneliness, of no sense of self, or self- worth.  Her struggles, her fears, her nightmares are made plain.  She takes you into a world of denial, of obsession, and she brings you out to the other side, where love and self worth is all that matters.  The book was beautiful, and sad.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Once again, excellent product and service from Amazon! I had lost my USB cable in a move, and so needed to buy a new one,<br />Super fast delovery. Thanks Amazon
B0083WLKBA|2.0|I bought series 1 and 2.  I had to get season 2 replaced because all the discs were messed up.  Then I discovered that the<br />last disc of season1 is messed up as well.  The DVDs came from &#34;Melbourne-Sidney&#34;, whatever that is.  Apparently they<br />don't know how to record onto discs.  Amazon was great in helping to replace season 2.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I laughed so hard at times because the main character Cat is crazy. She loves her job but also her man, Bones. These two are great together. I'm definitely a fan after only two books.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|My favorite listening during my younger years; still have the album, but decided it was time to bring one of the greatest bands of all time on the road.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|This book is one you don't want to put down until you know what happened to Pamela Werner.  It is all the more fascinating because it is a true story.  Very well written also.

B003WE9TU8|3.0|not a bad book overall but felt the plot line dragged out a little more but then again im more of a brian keene type of zombie reader than this. will wait and see what the movie does although i heard the zombies will all be CGI  a bold risk. did the studios  not learn from I Am Legend????

I since have received a new Laptop that had temps that surpassed 100c. I remembered that I still had AS5 so I applied some and right now under full load my CPU has yet to reach 50c. Please keep in mind I did a full clean so results will very.
B005LAII12|1.0|This movie falls flat on all accounts.  There are a few good setups/one-liners in the beginning as the story is laid out.  The story line is pathetic and every bit of dialogue along the way is just empty cliche.  Girl dumps boyfriend because he's carousing with his friends, boy realizes love is more important than booze, tries to get girl back.  Not even well acted, I felt no chemistry whatsoever.  The narrator concept (nice family narrator who &#34;surprises&#34; us with an occasional f-bomb or s-pile) is alright but poorly executed.  The story is not strong enough even to carry a comedy, and the jokes aren't good enough to overcome the lack of a story.  The entire value of this movie was a 10-minute standup routine.  Mark Walhberg is an honest, versitile actor but in this movie he is just another one-dimensional hollywood &#34;star&#34; not Mark Walhberg the actor.  This has to be Seth M's worst effort.

B008476HBM|5.0|If you have not read this since high school, you may find yourself quite delighted, as I did myself .
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved it. I have read all his books and they all leave you with a feeling, that changes you in a little way.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Starts slow but becomes interesting. Wonderful material on religion. If only we all could feel the way Pi does about God and stop being so possessive.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|my 2year old loves it. I would recommend it to everyone that's has a small one at home.  it is great.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris does a great job of describing the challenges of serving in the U.S.Military during the War On Terror. He aptly describes the desire to be part of the fight, the difficulty and guilt of priorities between duty, family and self. He shares the difficult decision to give up that which defines a Warrior and leaving the service. As I am currently in at process, it is comforting to know that eventually one's self identity can change in life after the Service. It is tragic that his life was seemingly cut short, but during his time he gave to everyone around him, perhaps not in the way or priority those individuals would always prefer, but in the final accounting, he gave to all of us: Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines, Wounded Veterans and his Family. Thank you, Chris!<br />MSG M.W. Corkrum, USAR

B005COO1X6|5.0|Edge of your seat suspense. I didn't put this down until I had read the whole thing. What a freak (the good kind) Mr. King is. Love all his books.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game but I kinda feel there should be motion controls on this game like on temple run but it's easy to pick up and play and I love the friend challenge!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I highly recommend this game to horse lovers! Fun and realistic tasks and lots of ways to customize your horses keep this game interesting!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Godfather was an excellent movie. Godfather 2 was an excellent movie. I haven't seen Godfather 3 because the popular opinion is that it tarnishes the series.<br /><br />While some call The Godfather a pivitol and finely executed film masterpiece, I have to disagree. THIS is the masterpiece of Don Corleone and his family; where the movie should be considered the companion piece to the novel (which makes sense since the novel was first!).  Nothing much else to say. If you know how great the movie(s) were, and you're curious about the books, expect better.
B0042816YK|1.0|The first dvd I received had problems with the picture. Pixels swarmed all over. I returned the copy for a replacement,  no big deal.. but when I received my new copy it was doing the exact same thing! I would think these copies would be better tested before sent out especially on a second go around. Disapointed.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|i love it  i love minecraft so i got it but it only gives you like 15 min thats long but not super long so yah...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was good. I liked it a lot. I need 11 more words, so I hope you like it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Alexander's comparison of his NDE with authentic physical characteristics and functions of the brain is just awesome!  His list of other resources has been very valuable, as well.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love this app with all of these new features that I couldn't do before. I also use it as a cheat because you could build something awesome in creative mode or put like a bunch of diamond down and just switch it to creative mode! Also you can just put blocks in your inventory by a few clicks of buttons. I also like all the new blocks but the clock an  the compass don't work for me. I would also like to see rope added. I highly recommend this for all those minecraft pe users out there!
1416987118|5.0|My twin grandchildren live in Brooklyn, I live in Texas. I bought a copy for them and one for me. I plan to read it to them on Skype. I was just there for their second birthday and read it several times. They loved it and listened intently through the whole story.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's a very good book I was a little confuse at first but I got it at the end of the day
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Being a 17 year old in a mainstream, rap and techno music world is kind of tough. Despite that, I am a lover of 40s-80s music and Rush is one of my favorites. I personally like every one of their albums with their debut being my favorite. Clockwork Angles was one of my reasons to live two years ago when it was announced. When I bought the album (Vinyl to be exact), I put it on my turntable and listened. Caravan is one of my favorite songs by far. The song is heavy and clear. After Caravan, I noticed that Geddy's voice is much too reverbed and it sometimes becomes unclear what instrument is playing what. If you listen to it enough times, though, you will be able to hear it and it will sound much clearer. Overall, this album is great for the amount of albums Rush has released over their 38 years of playing. Keep rocking!<br /><br />Album: 4 out of 5 stars. -1 star due to the reverby effects of Geddy's voice and the sometimes unclear roles of the instruments (Hard to hear what's playing what).<br /><br />P.S: When these songs are played live, it sounds absolutely amazing. There is no reverb at all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a wonderful game to play and keeps you happy as you earn gems, coins, win competitions, and buy new horses like unicorns and zebras.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|This is one of those few movies that I have to watch every few years because it makes me think and disturbs me to the marrow. There is really nothing else like it. It is as profound as the Matrix, just as stylish in a different way and creepier. I have a hard time figuring out which is the more important movie.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I think it's bull carp that she wasn't found sooner! And to the Carridos: Burn in the firey depths of HELL
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I love Wes Anderson. This is a great movie just like all of his works. I am continually impressed with Wes and the actors in his films.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Tremendous detail, gripping stories of interwoven lives--makes one appreciate the present when viewed from the trials and traumas of the past

B003TXSF5C|5.0|Written for the average person to enjoy and understand. Enjoyed this book.<br /><br />I plan to purchase some of his other work.
B00004CXMW|5.0|I used to LOVE this movie as a kid! Now that I am 23 I still put it in my DVD player ever once in a while. MJ was one of the reasons I started playing basketball in the first place. This movie is still super cute and funny!
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I was so disappointed and upset with the ending.  Poor Matthew, finally with the one woman he loved for so long........and once again Mary must face heartache.Unless Julian changes his mind and brings this kindhearted gentleman back to Mary and to us.  PBS - thanks to you, I have something great in the viewing arena to look forward to each week.
031603441X|5.0|I am not a contemporary of the Rolling Stones but have always loved their music (Beatles or Stones?  Stones for me far and away).  I was very excited about this book and boy did it deliver.  Heading into it I held Keith Richards in high esteem, even though I &#34;knew&#34; about his drug fueled past.  I went through an entire emotional gammit with Keith in this book.  I loved him for being strong enough at a young age to pursue what he wanted  and not give a damn about what he or anyone was supposed to do.  I hated him for being a degenerate drug addict that pushed away friends and family.  Then I loved him again for finding his balance between his life and his loved ones.  From an outsider's perspective, Keith doesn't pull any punches and has an incredible story to tell.  He doesn't want you to feel sorry for him, or even feel anything for him, he just tells a story and let's the reader interpret it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I can not stop playing it. It's so adicting. I recommend this game to anybody. So yeah!!
0765325950|5.0|For those of us that have stuck through this series from it's beginning, this was as good as an ending we could have hoped for.  This entire book is one tense battle of wills that had me turning pages and thinking about calling in sick to work just to keep reading.  I definitely got little sleep the week it took me to finish this.  I feel contented now that the series is over, and I will miss all of the characters and the joy they brought me for over a decade.  If you made it this far, you have to read this.  Sanderson did a masterful job finishing an epic world.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm doing this review. for fun if in Polly oxes j n n h g g f fvgvh h.  h h h f
0143034901|5.0|My girlfriend let me borrow her copy of this book and I had no expectations going in, but I fell in love with this book.  I ended up buying copies for both my mom and sister.  The characters were easy to care for and the author does a great job of describing Barcelona at the beginning of Franco's rise to power in Spain.  Anyone that has wandered the streets of Barcelona will appreciate Zafron's depictions of the city, from its luster to its underbelly.  The city itself is one of the best characters in this engaging story.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Love it so much it is easy and fast, kik me: Juliana1717 I really think u should get its BC it's amazing and I love it
B007ZYABW6|1.0|1) How probable or improbable is it that Rawicz, in addition to his other ordeals, took part in the famous<br />  Last Cavalry Charge of the Polish army?<br /><br />2) In discussing their escape plans, did the internees of a gulag in the Russian taiga hide behind a<br />  a \\"giant tree?'  There are no giant trees in the Russian taiga.<br /><br />3) Did the escapees crossing the Gobi Desert take shelter in a palm oasis?  Ridiculous --- winter<br />  temperatures in the Gobi can reach minus 40 degrees (F or C).<br /><br />4) Were the escapees saved from starvation by catching and eating snakes (\\"big blacks) which they caught<br />  with a forked stick?  There's no such thing as a \\"big black\\" snake in the Gobi.  Check it out.  No<br />  desert snakes are abundant enough to feed several people.  You can't catch a snake with a forked stick<br />  --- old wives' tale.<br /><br />5) Can one realistically cross the Himilaya on foot from China to India?<br /><br />6) Is it possible that in crossing the Himalaya on foot one might run into some Yetis?  Impossible.<br />  No such thing as a Yeti.  Mythical creature like Bigfoot.<br /><br />7) Can a bedraggled bunch of hippies waltz into India or any country with out any papers and be succored<br />  and be given free, prolonged hospital treatment?<br /><br />How did Rawicz get away with this and why are there so many gullible fools that believe it?<br /><br />Mark Newton, Skeptic Curmudgeon
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This was recommended by my sister.  She was right!  Riveting from start to finish.  Can't wait to view the rest of the season.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|its awesome.<br /><br />yeah any one who don't like it sucks. best kindle game I played<br />you must like it or yew die
B00AU2B0DE|4.0|I liked the music and the fact that someone is using a guitar to make music. The sound has some digital hash and sounded like there was a lot of post recording processing.
B000002AGN|4.0|I am not a huge jazz fan, but this CD is worth it.  You will recognize some of the songs on there as you hear them when you are out shopping.<br /><br />If you need a pick-me-up - this is a great CD to do it.
B003ONNWO6|5.0|If you have not seen this special -- I highly recommend it.  David Foster has introduced me to so many talented singers and performers over the years that they are too numerous to count. Adrea Bocelli duet of &#34;The Prayer&#34; sung with Katherine McPhee alone was worth the price of the disc.  I saw this special on PBS several years back and wanted a copy of the performance the instant the show ended, but I could not find it out in the stores.  I got a Christmas gift card from a sister and I re-checked the avaiability of this performance, and there it was on Amazon.  This is an evening of joy on a disc.  The songs are all solid hits, and a parade of superstars in the music industry.  If some of your favorite performers show up on the song listing -- buy this disc -- you won't be disappointed.
B009RH9J7W|2.0|This case is ok . . . a little thicker than I expected.  The leather has a very strong, chemical like odor to it.  I have to put the case outside often to air it out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The Downton Abbey series has been great to watch.  This is a wonderful story and it is very well done.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|A keeper. Will watch this movie over and over. Great story and cast. Jennifer Lawrence is awesome as Katniss. Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson are great as well.
B009329Y30|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie, a little bit out there on some things, but I enjoyed it.  Really liked the actors.
8866130915|5.0|Be sure to double check the sizing on the planner. I accidentally ordered the wrong one, thinking it was the normal notebook, but was actually the pocket-sized calendar. Otherwise, this was perfect. Just needs better labeling in the title of the product.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Fun game that is well thought out.  Always a challenge to keep the hostages alive. I also like the random splash effects.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|The story of Sixto Rodriguez is amazing.  Almost too fantastic to believe, but it's true.  Mr. Rodriguez also seems to be a very humble and content man with great qualities.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 7 year old day dreams about horses.  This is her favorite, she will sit there as long as I will allow her to play, lol.  It has great graphics it runs well on both my kindle fire original and my new kindle fire HD
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. its a challenge to beat the mini games to unlock more games. the games are simple but take a second to learn how to beat it. I give it a 5 out of 5.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|LOVE it!  Who knew another version of angry birds could be so much fun!  I love the creative new birds and gravity effecting levels.  They really made Star Wars and Angry Birds one amazing game!
B000CNFC76|5.0|Love this movie, and it is a true story.  This shows how someone who believes in himself can rise above what his current station and become a bigger and better man.  Determenation and perservience!
B008HK3S04|4.0|Construction is excellent.  Color is more blue than the teal in the picture, but close.  I bought because of the description and the 360 degree protection.  I wish it had a bit stiffer protection on the front and back to protect the item.  I also wish it had 3 strips of velcro to keep it closed.  But overall it works well and fits the Kindle Fire HD perfect.
B0098JJYZQ|5.0|Breathtaking thoroughly enjoyed both books....... Can't wait for the next book.....<br /> Just love Gabriel and Julia....... Don't like the idea of Gabriel wearing a bow tie makes him seem old....<br />  Little bit of humour in it...
1475143389|5.0|I really enjoyed Mike's book, and its the best read on the topic I have come across yet. Starts with the basics of nutrition and muscle building and gives a good platform for anyone looking to get in the gym and take it seriously. Refreshingly free of gimmicks and cliches. Give it a try, I doubt you will be disappointed.
B0095XPZBC|3.0|This collection gives you enough behind the scenes stuff, that is not the problem.  The problem is the price.  It's priced 3 times higher than other well respected TV shows on bluray with not really any more content.  Infact even less content.  They don't even offer digital copies.  I love star trek, and it looks better than you've ever seen it on TV, but at some point Paramount has to come back down to earth and price Star Trek atleast close to what other TV seasons are going for on bluray.  With lack of digital copy and insanely high price, I have to just call this a lazy milking instead of a passionate release.  For the price I am paying I expect to be able to watch these on my ipod touch so I can bring them with me wherever I go.
B00881VLCE|2.0|I enjoy the app but it closes on it's own. Puzzles are lost mid play. It's hit or miss somethings.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I buy a lot of my music from Amazon, so this app is perfect for downloading and syncing that music without any fuss. I don't use it as a player, because I don't play it off the &#34;cloud&#34; and I have a much better program for playing the music on my device.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I loved this game as a kid and it is still as much fun now as it was then. Nice to play a game you know.
0547260695|5.0|The quality is astonishing. I am a big fan of The Little Prince and have been since 6th grade. I have many editions and give the book as a gift often. This edition was purchased as a gift for the young granddaughter of a dear friend; after receiving it and examining it closely I decided to keep this copy and order a second as the gift. The quality of the art and the engineering of the pop-ups are extraordinary. The translation is different than the 2 other english versions but quite good. This book is something that you will want to save and show as art. Buy 2; one to read and one to put away.  I have no complaints at all w/ this product only praise.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Another fun game. Beem awhile since I played but it all came back to me. Enjoyed all the games I played
B00A85EMVK|1.0|The quality of the transfer on the blue ray disc I have was awful-one of the worst I have seen for grain. I use a sony PS3 blue ray player and a sharp elite 70\\" led tv which is basically a referance tv set.  To get the ascpect ration the film was cropped top and bottom from original but its the grain that is plain awful.  The sound track rocks however and makes up for the picture quality somewhat. As a comparision I put in my original DVD and let my new set up convert the quality and it looked just as good as the blur ray version.  The 3d is very nice and its a real shame that this picture did not get the treatment it deserves. Hopefully with a new top gun in the works in a few years maybe we will see a new release with the original up to snuff but until then avoid this disc if you have a quality set.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is great except that when you get to the collect 500,000 coins it gets stuck.  I have been stuck on that objectives for a very long time and passed that number a while back.  also if you do really well early those objectives are met and you don't get credit for them when it comes to leveling which punishes you for doing well early.  but on the other side the graphics are great the addition of gems and saves are so much better then the wings of the old game.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|A horrifyingly descriptive story with a triumphant finish. Takes you into the mind of the killer, the victim, and the survivors.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Megan picks up a guy at a bar drunk and they get married.  The morning after, she can't remember him (can't<br />even say his name right), dioesn't remember their marriage and is very hungover.  She wants a divorce, but<br />can her new husband Connor change her mind.  Will they stay married?<br /><br />Cute read and the characters are enjoyable.  If you want somewhat belivable characters and enjoy the highs<br />and lows of the relationship, this is the book for you.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Great book,.... not just the opinion of someone,... this is based on Facts adn data,... shall be read.<br />great concepts for implementing long term success....
145470246X|5.0|The Beaded fantasies book is a great book, i would definitely recommend it.<br />The patterns are very well explained and it's very addictive.
B00464F19Q|4.0|While gory and dramatic this story really bring's to life each individual sin in a new way that has never been done before this movie, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman's acting is really inovating for the time this movie was done.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wallflower broke my heart, in a way I'll love and cherish forever. I bough  this book expecting a coming of age story, and instead stepped into a dark world in which a boy discovered how to be happy. And I loved it.
B009LRE040|5.0|We all waited for so long for this sequal to come out and it didn't disappoint at all, loved to see this on Amazon Instant Prime and it was so much less than in the stores too.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|Best game ever very challenging and very fun whoever invented this game is a total genius and should make other games like this when I first played this game<br />My exact words where wow and this is fun I LOVE it!!!!!!!!
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|This movie as that was promised, more action than the Origonal, and it was really cool to see  Kate Beckinsale play a bad guy (or girl I should say) and the CGI was really cool, but if you think about it the Origonal was really rather quite inovative for the 90's that movie did thing's that no one had even thought of at that time. I really wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be, the acting really wasn't all that great, well that's not fair the acting from these actor's is always awesome but the screen play just wasn't what I thought it would be. While it wasn't regergated of the 90's verson it really could have been better, although it is on Amazon Instant Prime it can be watched anywhere which as my family travels is quite nice so all in all yea I give it 4 stars.
0525953728|3.0|Sorry, the book didn't do much for me. I raced through it in 7 days, only because my library had a 7 day check-out restriction, but I rarely found myself anxious to read my quota of 45 page per night. The book lacked flavor and paled in comparison to other military operation accounts such as [[ASIN:B0035YDM4Y Lone Survivor]] and \\"House to House\\" by David Bellavia.<br /><br />No disrespect to the author, as I'm sure he's a highly credentialed SEAL and has given much to this country than most. His August 2012 interview on \\"60 Minutes\\" available on YouTube in its entirety was a sufficient and quite intriguing account of the raid that killed UBL. The book was a nice touch in chronicling the event.
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|I was extremely disappointed in this move, I know I know what more can you expect from the 5th installment of a series that really should be done?!?! But I guess I really did expect something more from this, the acting was great but the story line just really.... well lack of a better word was SUCKED!!! Really hope this series is done now cuze we just can't handle another one like this. We did get this Amazon Instant Prime which is awesome and for cheaper than at the store or any other online digital download site on our XBox.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is a great game but there is no replay value once you beat it. The mini games are limited and as of February 24, 2013 there is no Zen Garden.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I laughed so hard at this movie!! I really was better than the first one and I thought the first was great and to see so many great actor's in one movie was awesome!! The only movie I can compare this to is RED. And on Amazon Instant Prime it makes it much much better too, we can take it anywhere and laugh anytime we want too.
B00004WL7O|5.0|I have over 300 CDs, I vaguely Remember this band name, I don't know why. But I'm glad I do. This is my best album.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great book! Gives many other books to reference to and to read them.  I hope he keeps writing these books with the character Robert Langdon.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|The acting, action, and special effects are wonderful. Entertaining start to finish, sometimes so good I forget to breathe. Five stars all the way.
0807208523|5.0|I used this as a read aloud in my classroom & it was great for the author to be reading the story to the children.
B0060LYM34|5.0|This is a great movie and I would love to see it available for streaming for Prime Members. Just thought I'd add a blurb.
B000J103YI|5.0|when I first saw this movie, I said to myself that I had to have it when released.  And now I have and enjoy watching it.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Kids love this movie....a must to add to your collection...but today and watch over and over...kids love it....great movie...nuff said
B004D9FLJE|5.0|I was very impressed with everything about this season.  I heard that the other seasons were not as good as the first, but I LOVED the first season.
0425252868|5.0|This is one of the best accounts of WW11 I have read.  I purchased it for my Kindle and am buying it for my husband, a WW11 veteran and for our grandson, a flight instructor in Florida.  I liked the story for several reasons; I was a teenager during the 1940's and remember the news accounts of that war, my father was an Air Corps Chaplain, I've made four trips to Germany between 1980 and the year 2000, and finally my maternal ancestry includes a Mennonite minister who came from the Rhineland via Holland to Philadelphia in the late 1600's.
B000O174CM|5.0|I never found anything more spectatular than how all of the actors/actresses vibed.  Great movie and it's a must have!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a James Bond fan and I had to have th latest 007 Skyfall on Blu-ray.  It is about as close as you can get to the big screen.<br />Happy to have this classic in my library!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is so fun. Some of it is hard, but the rest is easy and fun.But the cool part is that the game has other types of Where's My Water.
0470901071|5.0|Note: If you are taking the test in two parts, ICND1 and ICND2, reading this book in it's entirety may be too much to take in for the first test. Personally I used this book to study for ICND2 only. For ICND1 I would recommend a lighter load of materials based solely on the ICND1 objectives. Overall this book is well written, easily understandable, and well formatted to follow objectives in a logical order. I would recommend this book for anyone that is going for their CCNA.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I would like this alot better if it was not such a task to get to my channel where my favorites are. The list of suggested videos seem out in left field to me.
B00BESM14U|5.0|A Great Movie!!!<br /><br />Bought the DVD after seeing it online.<br /><br />Goes in my all time classics collection.<br /><br />A Must see!
B0063IH60K|3.0|We all know what's going on when you're playing solitaire: utter boredom. It's a good game. The player just has to control where the cards go: don't allow the game to make all the choices for you.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a very entertaining game... if you are a my little pony fan you will love this game. highly recommended! the voices from the show are an added bonus.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was so thought provoking and inspiring. It truly gives one a clear message that wasting time is a waste of time.
B000093BDX|4.0|I saw this and had to have it.  brings out memories of the sixties, a pleasant time for me.  Good album for anyone that likes the Beach Boys.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|One of those books that draws you in more and more the longer you read. Combining different worlds and stories and then slowly bringing them together without it feeling forced. Cannot wait to start the 3rd part.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoyable download for our Kindle.  Gives us an enjoyable pastime especially when the weather is foul, and outdoor activities are restricted.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I had never heard of Adele until I saw her on &#34;60 Minutes&#34; and decided to buy her CD.  She has such talent and feeling in her voice that I predict she'll be a perennial favorite.  I'm 70 - I like her almost as much as my old Rock 'n Roll records!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Downloaded into my wife's Kindle,  Used to occupy my Grand daughters time when she visits.  She enjoys playing it, and helps occupy her time.
B00AHEDXXA|5.0|I was very impressed with how quickly my purchase was shipped. It was still in the original package as specified. I was very happy to receive this movie so quickly. It's a good movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! It is so addictive! I recommend  this game to everyone... it's great!!! So come and play!!
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Works well, takes some getting used to with other devices buy over all its cool. Very accurate and quick when identifying music
0811877485|1.0|Fall off wall over night!  Spent almost as much as the 2 products for speedy delivery so we could do it with our two grandsons over our 1 week visit to see them,  Thomas train was great, Eric Carles caused extreme disappointment to our 2 year old.  Every night his hungry caterpillar stickers fell off wall.  Yet his brothers was still hung up.  Same paint as in his brother's room. Just an inferior product. Then to have to take the dots and everything off and send his room decor back was awful for him. Was a nightmare for us with our grandsons whom we have so little time to be with because of long distance.  Amazon, don't sell things from vendors like this.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a good book and makes u laugh from time to time<br />I just like it really good book really
1250027624|4.0|This is a great read for Downton Abbey fanatics (like me). I have one 'quibble' with Julien though - why he says he 'loves Ms. O'Brien' is beyond me.  She is the epitome of all the Irish 'biddies' I have come across throughout my long life, taken to the extreme. She is not only mean and spiteful, she is a murderess. I would have to pity her in real life, as she doesn't even seem repentant. I have to say that her character does add to the story content, but can't abide that the author considers her his favorite one.
B00846REIS|4.0|I found this book to exciting and hard to put down, kept wanting to read more and more.  keeps you pulled in for the whole ride.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|One of t<br />he best halo books I've read yet I cannot wait until I can buy another one : )
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Ha ha, made you look! This classic is so worth reading, again and again. Bram Stoker is a genius. He invents many of the characteristics of the vampire that we take as traditional lore today. Spectacular.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a fun game although I would like it more if it was more teen ager friendly but it is still a very good game
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I got this (free) book for my kindle because it was recommended by Preston and Child, the writers of the Pendergast series. They based one of their characters on a character in this book (Count Fosco), and he is a similar, chilling man. There are lots of unexpected twists and turns, there is romance, there are tense scenes and scary scenes. It is well-written, not too old-fashioned. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Though I got it for free, I would pay for it.
0385341008|4.0|i wasn't too keen on the idea of an entire novel only in letters, but soon enough i loved it.  any auhtor who can take the immediate post WW2 trauma, and somehow make it a light hearted, funny read while not minimizing the evil, is pure genious!
B003L77GRO|5.0|got it fast and for a great price. It was wrapped great and worked perfectly. no problems or issues at all.
B003CP72QK|5.0|Good story and action. Also, great actors throughout. If you like a good story that doesn't put you to sleep, then watch this.
B005FISBTO|5.0|love the show and loved how cheat and fast i was able to get this. i am addicted and was mad that i did not have the season and got it fast in mail so i could watch it.
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|I played online and it rocks, but it says j don't own it so I removed it and now it wont download
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Damn i love this game so much what I'm talking with Amy rose to make a tnt minecraft pocket edition survival how to make a subway sufers
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|I find the overall production of great quality.  The music is chosen from the best of an era.  The reason I did not give this movie/musical 5 starts is because it just never seems to amaze me that such wonderful works of art are ruined due to a few inappropriate words or immoral (and VERY UNNECESSARY) additions of such things as references to homosexuality and other inappropriate items making it unsuitable for people who strive to rise above the everyday rustics of society.  Although it is a brief addition at the end, for me it spoils the entire movie.  As a YHWH fearing soul,  I believe SIN is define through the TORAH.  It is NOT subject to discussion.  Either you believe in YHWH (God) or you don't.  The Messiah, YahuShua (or Jesus for those that know Him by His english nick name)  said, &#34;If you love me, you will follow my commands&#34;.)  Those Commands are all from Torah.  Therefore, although this production has the potential to be one of the BEST musicals in modern day, for me it is ruined by unnecessary reference to sins.  Perhaps there is some idea that it will encourage more viewing, but I do not agree.
B005HSL626|5.0|I have played this game before it is addicting. Can't wait to play again. taking to spain with me yea!!!
0446547573|2.0|SOAP OPERA NOT TO MUCH IN THE WAY OF COMPENSATION TO QUALIFY FOR MORE THAN A SOAP OPERA DIDNT LIKE IT THE STORY IS ALSO OLD, REPEATED MANY TIMES IN MANY BOOKS, TV STORIES AND MOVIES
B005DOKIYG|5.0|I really like the cover no worry about breaking kindle and no scratches. im really happy . everyone should have one.
B00006RAKP|5.0|MY HUSBAND IS IN NURSING HOME, I PLAY MUSIC FOR HIM ALL DAY THIS 2 DISC OF ELTON JOHN HITS IS MUCH BELOVED BY BOTH OF US
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this series.  It's been a long since I read my last book and I read all 3 in less the 15  days!!!!<br /><br />Great writing!!!!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Good read, great look into addiction and fame. I was a big fan of the music of M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e as a child and it was interesting to read about the men behind it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is an awsome app you can even use ur own music... yayy for us so if u need a good alarm for the kindle this is the app that is worth your time
B00701L5XS|5.0|I love knots, but never learned how to tie much more then my shoes until I started sailing.  Now that it is a matter of safety I find myself with plenty of incentive.  This app show in clear graphics and easy steps just how to tie a selection of the most important knots.  Being able to watch them being tied, and turning the image  360 degrees at will allows anyone to become proficient; and quickly builds confidence in any type of knot tying situation.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is a BEAST.  Made in the USA (oh yea!).  Great for chopping and just about anything else you need it for in its knife class.  What makes this knife even better is its price point.  Cheaper than a RAT or ESEE and can do just as much work for you.  High quality, kick @ss knife.<br /><br />I believe I have the &#34;new and improved&#34; sheath.  It still sucks.  I put it in the sheath for the first time, I heard the *snap* to tell me it's secure... and it took me 10 minutes to get it out again.  Let's face it, most sheaths that come with knives are horrible - but I think this one is at the top of the list.  Nothing about it I like.  Despite this, the knife is totally worth it.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I thought Skyfall was an OK action movie but it certainly wasn't up to the James Bond franchise standards. I just didn't get that Bond feeling when watching the movie.
B00386EZJU|5.0|My daughter received the DVD as a gift and I immediately knew I needed to purchase the soundtrack - something that has never happened before.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I've read this wonderful classic several times. Love the Bronte books. Also just read Jane Eyre. Can't beat the classics.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This is a fast moving fun game. I am 79 years old and have arthritis in my hands pretty bad and this is one of the games that seems to help loosen them up and help the pain. also it is a very fun game with lots of challenges.
B00478CFAE|5.0|The lyrics of this Australian brother and sister are very soothing, yet haunting when vocalizing. The folk style of instrumentation is fantastic! It works great for foreplay and seduction as well as feeling as if the songs were wrote for you, especially about a situation of your past, present, and future.  Great music and a good purchase!
630542845X|5.0|Great movie.  Shows how human beings should be if we were really all non violent creatures as a lot of us claim to be.  Loved the paranormal aspect (which could happen maybe someday with genetic engineering).  Definitely a movie for Sci-Fi and Fantasy movie fans.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|I own all three of their c.d.s and really like how they write. Just good music written by great musicians
B007REV4YI|5.0|Action packed, great acting. Javier Baden is a fascinating villain. Can't believe that there have been 50 years of Bond movies! Have enjoyed many of them over the years.
B00992CF6W|4.0|OK on survival since the new update came I went on that world and my house was a floating house so I went on everything fell and crashed it was a gold house it took me forever to make it and it fell down:( but everything else is looking good
0307943232|5.0|The plot took lots of twists and turns. It was hard to stop listening to.<br />The reader was great. I've listened to it twice now and it was better the second time.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the most moving books I've ever read! I actually have to reread it again because I couldn't' put the darn thing down! The stories of both men doing their best for country they loved! Details were unbelievable and if you can read this book without wiping tears from your eyes,you're one tough person!Dan H
1400063736|5.0|I read a paperback copy of this book a couple of years ago. I loved it so much that I had to buy the hardcover as a keepsake.
B0086213XW|3.0|This movie has some real positives. Michelle Williams is a wonderful actress with a wide range, both emotionally and in her looks (some scenes she looks gorgeous, others a bit frumpy). The extended foreplay of the budding adulterous relationship, however, was too stagey. I also stopped watching a few times, but did make it through. Also, while Seth Rogen is lovable, he couldn't really pull off the emotional expression his role really needed.
B00867GHS8|5.0|I dont have a 3D player, but this was cheaper than the Blu ray combo. Shipped on time, and disc play fine.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it. It has great graphics and I love the logic of it.<br />I recommend this app to anyone who likes horses and has time to spare.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|Bought this for my friend who is a collector of Monopoly games. He loved it. Loved the pieces, and loved the properties. Very happy with my purchase.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I READ THIS BECAUSE I SEEN A PREVIEW OF THE MOVIE ON TV. MY BUDDY SAID I SHOULD READ IT ON MY KINDLE. I'VE NEVER READ A BOOK ON A KINDLE BEFORE. IT WAS DIFFERENT. HOWEVER I ENJOYED READING IT ON THE KINDLE.<br />THE BOOK WAS EXCELLENT. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO HAS AN OPEN MIND AND LIKES TO READ.<br /><br />IT'S NOT LONG. READ IT IN A FEW HOURS.<br />FIVE STARS.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|schrade schf9...this is my favorite survival knife of all. it's tough as old leather, sharp, heavy in a good way and fits my hand like a glove. i can baton firewood in no time at all and it stays sharp. i love the length and the great handle, it's easy to wittle firesticks and i'm sure it would slice a nice side of venison or beef..all in all it's another great knife from schrade. of all my various knives this is a real keeper and goes to the top of my list.
B00A6F9YFQ|5.0|PSB making more hits, love the lyrics and melody, song composed in classic PSB with progressive trends in the mix
B000P0J09W|4.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie as a kid. i ordered it for my sister for Christmas.  it arrived on time and in perfect condition
B00B2JOJIM|3.0|Kind of a let down, need some more power in the song musically, lyrics are awesome. I'm sure they are holding the A+ quality songs in the forthcoming full length album. A &#34;B&#34; side would have been nice on this MAXI single.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I have been struggling with a difficult baby for the past two years and no longer expect any book to provide the answers. I enjoyed this book probably because I wasn't hoping it would solve all my parenting problems. It is well written and gives you something to think about.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the first one. The arena setting was creative and challenging. I`m looking forward to the last book in the trilogy to see what happens to Katniss and the people of Label
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Very creative. Game play is intuitive and smooth.<br />Most of all it is fun to play.<br />Ready for that next update!!!
075669812X|5.0|took forever to get as Ninjago anything is so popular but worth the wait as my 5 and 6 year old grandsons sat right down to read right through the book and discuss every detail.  well done and fun.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Though this book was very good - chuck full of history - I liked Fall of Giants better.  Good character development.
1609611543|4.0|Book arrived as expected.  Still reading this one, very interesting topic, but now  book you read from cover to cover.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book started out slow but got better as it went along.  I particularly liked the vernacular.  I was interested to read that the orphen situation in Ireland had some basis in truth.
B00004U5SC|5.0|My husband loves this movie.  He would watch it every day if I let him.  Was in great shape, just as advertised.
1608871045|5.0|My grandson, who loves everything Batman, couldn't take his eyes from the book.  The photos and information contained in the book made Batman feel like a real person.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like visiting an old friend. But none of my friends have houses quite like this. But end of season 3...what a cliffhanger!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  It was truly an inside look at the Navy Seals and how they train for a mission.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone curious about how we find ourselves. There are many paths to self awarness and Cheryl's is one of the ost interesting. Great read.
B006M4F67A|5.0|and this game keeps me busy.  I don't need to sit with my friends for an afternoon or evening to play the game.  I can play anywhere and at any time particularly because you don't need a wifi signal as you do with Words with Friends.  I also like the different mah jong game screens that can be selected.
B0001ZMWQY|5.0|A great addition to my collection. Truly great sound. If you are even remotely a fan of franz Ferdinand an own a turntable then this is a wise purchase.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Basic, good solitaire game. Easy to play. I like that you can see stats for your games. Good way to pass the time.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was very good because it was funny! I think lots of kids will like this book a lot!
B00318CV28|1.0|Bad business! So disappointed and I hope that this will be rectified because my granddaughter is extremely disappointed. Will not work in ANY DVD player
B008220C38|2.0|Didn't care much for the story line; the costumes in this movie were wonderful.  The story line kept jumping all around.  Not worth the money to buy, but probably rent.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|This app is enjoyable and challenging.  I would've like to have had a bit of direction at the home screen, but you eventually figure out what you're supposed to do.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a great series to watch; I hope it continues for years to come.  This purchase is worth every penny.
030746363X|5.0|Just don't try and read it from cover to cover ;)<br />The diet is so easy to follow and is working... I've never felt healthier!<br />Buy his new cook book for some great slow carb ideas.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|From a neurosurgeon/non believer this testament is astounding.  He provides clinical evidence from collegues and very discriptively provides the reader with insight into his experience beyond this world.  Although I struggled with his medical terminology I felt it was necessary to prove his experience from a medical professional's point of view.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This book is perfect for those who are thinking about starting their own business or who have already started one.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is entertaining for adults and children.  There is good silliness for children and a great story of learning what's important in life (your loved ones) that appeals to all ages.<br /><br />The characters are very fun, as are the &#34;inventions&#34; and the Minions provide good giggles.  I really enjoyed Steve Carell's performance.<br /><br />Grown-ups, don't shun this one because it's animated!  It's just a good story.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I have enjoyed watching Games of Thrones Season 2, but I must say I was quite surprised to have finished the entire 2nd season in one Sunday afternoon sitting and watching each blu-ray disc back to back (5 disk (10 episodes)).  All episodes are just too short and so many intrigues, actions, plots, schemes are omitted from many episodes of season 2, A Clash of Kings, that I was/am just sorely unhappy about this HBO Game of Thrones 2nd season.<br /><br />Because HBO/GRRM casted Renly Baratheon as a gay king romantically involved with Loras Tyrell there really was no room for the episode to depict Brianne the Beauty's extreme secret love for King Renly Baretheon to the point that she disguised herself as Renly during Stannis' ground attack against Casterly Rock, and exacted vengeance on Stannis while he fought Tyrion & the Lannisters aptly dealing a great blow to Stannis and contributing to his losing the land battle to overtake the castle.  That the men who'd left Renly to fight for Stannis after Renly's death thought he (Renly) had returned from the dead (it was Brianne) to lead them and they turned on Stannis and slew many of his bannermen.<br /><br />Why was the part when Tyrion used massive chains to close up the outer harbor (from beneath the sea) that lead into and out of castle waters, and trapped Stannis' ships in that harbor at castle during the sea battle with no way to escape the wildfire, left out?  There was no need to omit this important battle strategy that revealed Tyrion as superior battle tactician (planning and bravery).<br /><br />The episode that depicted Jon and the Qhorin Halfhand was so short and choppy that it would be hard for anyone who had not read the novels to know that it was their (Jon and Qhori'sn) plan to have Halfhand and Jon intentionally fallout and fight and that Jon was to kill the Halfhand in combat to get closer to Mance and his free people beyond the Wall and learn their plans.<br /><br />Daenery's trip to the House of the Undying was just too short and omitted her search through many doors having many experiences before she finally happened upon her dragons having them burn the entire House of the Undying down.<br /><br />Don't get me started on Sansa's, Arya's, (Gentry's) Rob's, Bran/Richon's stories and how much is just left out from what's given us of them in A Clash of Kings novel.<br /><br />HBO & GRRM stop lessening/shorting stories of ASOIAF episodes because you can and still achieve thrilling stories that are good, but not great as is all stories as they are depicted in the novels!
B0060CXAHC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's full of funny and sweet moments and tells a great story that is as enjoyable and touching for adults as it is for children.  The animation is beautiful!<br />I do not have children and enjoy watching this movie at least 4 times a year.
0790729709|5.0|Enjoy my new dvd very please with the product.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|great app!! definitely recommend it !love how it shows the weather and I love how u can add a note to ur alarm
6305657947|5.0|Enjoy my new dvd very please with the product.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 was just as good as the first one. Looking forward to Season 3. Can't wait to see what happens next!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|A favorite book since I was a child.  So happy to share with my children. They are always excited to read this story.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It's one of the best book ever! I love the percy Jackson series so much!! I wish there were more books!!
B006POGWB6|1.0|This says it's region free, yet won't play in any Blu-Ray player I own.  Not pleased at all.  And since I can't return it, I'm stuck with a movie I can't watch.
030759565X|4.0|Beautiful visuals and so far have loved every recipe I have tried.  I prefer steps listed instead of picking them out of a paragraph but I can deal with this.  Book could be more organized (photo of dish should actually be on the same page as the recipe) but the recipes have been excellent .  The only thing my family hasn't liked is the bitter chocolate in the raspberry rugelach recipe.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Hands down the best Amazon purchase i've ever made. This was ridiculously low priced for the 3 movies plus bonus commentary and artwork. Awesome is too poor a word to describe this.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Can't wait to read the next one!! It left so much unanswered, but I couldn't put it down. I am recommending this book to my son!
B005G4TJUC|4.0|I mean, this was never the greatest movie ever, but I own the other two so logically i had to have this one. Came quickly, shipped well, no problems...except the film itself...just....bad.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical prior to beginning this book.  However, this book captured my intense interest from chapter one. This is one of the few books that I couldn't put down. I'm excited to read the remaining books in the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked it better than the movie. I think the second one might be better than this though. Second is always better
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I just started but I find it fun and addicting. There are cute monsters and a simple battle system. It's great.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The only thing that bugs me is that there really isn't that many sounds to pick , however there was one day it didn't go off. Otherwise it is nice and simple and hasn't failed to wake me up with the exception of that one time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|That was a great read. I felt scared and falling in love right along side of Katie. I hated Kevin and loved Alex.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a great book. One of my favorite books. I would recommend this book to anyone
B007MDB6L0|2.0|I ordered this DVD and the case was shattered when I received the package.  I haven't yet played the DVD- I am hoping that the disk is not scratched.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book but let a few hints that I found easy to figure out but still very good second book.
B004SBULWE|5.0|ICS and JB don't seem to need it but Froyo and GB were not as good at memory management. This was a big help on those OS's.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|love it got new kindle fire for christmas started watching almost everyday couldn't wait to watch it daliy when is season 4 going to start ???
B0081BU42O|5.0|Certainly not my choice for where to start if you've never read the Culture books before but if you are well versed in the Culture then this is a winner. And it seems to be Banks' second in a row with a Patrick McGoohan homage.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i'm always on facebook to see family and friends pictures to be updated about things happening in my area and voice my own  opinoin's
B005R32L66|3.0|It's skype, what else can I say? It works most of the time although the video is slow and loses resolution frequently.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Your kindle fire HD camera is just a s good. Don't waste your money. The only good features  is the timer,and even that is a struggle.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Great app for working with MS Office files. I especially like the sync to Google documents. Let's me access documents anywhere, on any device running the app. Well worth the purchase price for the full version.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|Feel-good chick flick. One of my favorite go to movies of all time. Makes me tear up every time. YES
1881273377|5.0|This should be a mandatory read. I am so happy to be able to pass it on the friends and family. Looking forward to reading the children's edition
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Tried to watch only a couple of episodes at a time but I could not. Plan to have a Homeland marathon if you get this. Great series.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|The movie was very moving, but the music made it even more so. John Williams is the best sound track composer today, and he doesn't disappoint here. The only thing he could have done to make it even better would have been to use more period pieces. As it is, &#34;Battle cry for freedom&#34; is one of the most stirring songs on the list.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|it reliably synchronize the to do list on all devices and my PC.  it all lists all the items that is due today and this week on my PC.  I've not found any issue after 6 months of usage - solid and useful - like a dream app.
B008OE05IG|5.0|This documentary is truly amazing, Jiro's story, his family and the dedication to their cragt are truly remarkable!<br />the music is amazing and the way they develop the whole story is great!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|When your brain is tired and you just want to read something light, this is the book for you. Great read after a fast-paced business trip, on the plane ride home. Funny, well-written. Good observations without being preachy.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Great product.  I purchased a Logitech Performance MX mouse and returned it because it was uncomfortable especially the button above the scroll wheel which gets in the way when scrolling.  The Anker mouse is designed better to fit my hand and the customizable buttons are very useful.
B0036O0ELM|5.0|I can only echo what Gramapphone Magazine and other critics have commented upon over the years:  Gobi, DeStefano and Callas in a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This case works fine, however a stylus holder would have been a great addition, especially since the price was higher than it should have been for the product.  I now see just a month later its on sale at what it should be.  For almost $50, one should get a little more for the money than the product offers.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|If you saw the movie and are confused, this will help bring things into perspective.  It is work to read. but worth it.  Just keep going, don't worry about pronouncing every single word correctly in your mind.  Just read it.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Some reviews said there were issues with the time keeping accuracy of this watch but so far mine is keeping great time! Love the look and feel of this watch. Sometimes I for get that I'm wearing it. Its very comfortable.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I only recently watch this show and my brother told me the six season would just keep getting darker and darker but it would have my favorite episode and he was right!  The musical episode is amazingly clever, fun, and yet still important to the storyline.  So if you haven't seen the episode avoid the music, spoilers!  However if you want to jam out with the Scoobys (and know what happens) then I highly recommend the CD.  There is a bonus with Joss Whedon singing so that's was cool to hear.  And I have friends who have seen Merlin but not Buffy so I've had them listen to Uther (Giles) sing and it blows their minds :)  I have enjoyed this soundtrack very much and highly recommend it for Buffy fans.

B000B6CODO|5.0|you must see it if fantasy is your game.  The acting of the kids and adults with Crier are fun
1400052181|4.0|Not only was it a good story, but it gave a fairly uncomplicated history of the HeLa story, which I feel was left out of my science classes. The fact that these cells still exist and their importance in the history of science since their discovery is amazing.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I felt the book left us hanging. The first half was excellent, the second half could have been better.
0425252868|5.0|A tearful true story of honor among warriors. A movie by Spielberg would do the book justice. The film should cover all battles of the book from both perspectives. Victories for the Knight's Cross should be further investigated to truly authenticate the points awarded. Anti NAZI resistance should be brought out and added to the movie. I don't know if I really go along with the Vogel Flight. I think that rules, gun camera verification and self discipline would not have let phony points accumulate. An example was, using up ones ammo for the shadow target shoot in order to substantiate phony victories. What senior officer would belive that fib.
0060254920|5.0|This is a classic book.  Bought it for a friends baby shower.  You just can't go wrong with this!  Big hit.
0765325950|5.0|It was a well-written, almost blow by blow telling of the final battle between the forces of Light and the Dark One and his minions. As such it was a slow read; it was a bit too intense. I read it over many short sitting rather than long stretches. In the end, it was not bad; but it could have been better. It was almost worth the wait, definitely better than the final volume in the Riverworld series.
0060775858|5.0|Very sweet classic bedtime story.  Bought it for a friends baby shower (I have to say, I wasn't the only one).

0345529057|5.0|bought this after seeing the first season of GoT on HBO, and it is just as amazing, i stopped reading a long time ago but this series made me rediscover the art. if you are a fan of the show, get this. it is significantly different enough yet still capturing the same element that it is so great.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really love this book because it was very good and happy except the part when Dasie died that was very sad.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|very gritty and real. opens your eyes to the opening days of the conflict from a soldiers perspectives. its not an all out rambo action flick. it is a real life paced POV type storyline while still maintaining entertainment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book!  I didn't realize it was going to be a movie and to tell the truth, I'm kind of afraid to see it for fear it might not live up to the book!  This truly identified the crazy mind of an abuser and made me proud that the abused was able to get away and find a new life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good I really love how it's realistic one of my cable<br />Favourite game :) seriously get it!!! My horses name is milkshake
B00797MB0O|2.0|by suggesting it is a dark comedy, suggesting those that didn't like it as simpletons incapable of understanding the depths of the cinematic writing genius at work. Those people are the sister of the cripple who got beat up in high school and if you watch this movie you'll understand what I mean. Plainly, this movie is rewarding only in the last 12-22 minutes which you can safely skip right too and watch and you will not have missed a thing. That's all I would recommend you do. Otherwise, the only other reason to watch is because Theron is actually so damn hot just like you want her to be, but she's mine.. one day she'll see.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|i bought this case for my girlfriend for valentines day. This case may be waterproof, snowproof, and mudproof but she dropped it a week later on her carpet no less and a crack resulted on the top of the screen. there really is nothing protecting the screen just a thin layer. The other stuff might be great but the main purpose of a screen is so it doesn't crack or break. Do not buy because of the other so called &#34;Proofs&#34;.

B0016JBCJW|4.0|After seeing Moonrise Kingdom - Wes Anderson's best film in our opinion - we have been trying to watch his earlier films of which this is one. A sweet and quirky family adventure story based on three somewhat estranged brothers who are on a somewhat undefined mission. Anderson fans will like it.

B0063IH60K|2.0|I hate the ads that pop up every time you hit &#34;play.&#34;  It seems almost impossible to win, not as good as the solitaire game I have on my computer.
B009WJ44KC|5.0|Much of this music sounds like it was written by Rachel Portman. It is very lyrical and much more simply orchestrated than Williams' usualy style. The inclusion of banjo and fiddle music is perfectly appropriate for this genre, but not something you would expect from John WIlliams.
0307949486|5.0|Due to the length of the book, I was afraid it would take me a while to finish reading it. However, after the first chapter, I was hooked and completed it in two weeks. The trilogy is well written, suspenseful, and left me wanting to read more about Lisbeth. Very sad that there will be no more books from this author.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book.  Katniss finds herself as the unwilling and unsure Mocking Jay.  The living walking breathing symbol of the Rebellion of Panem.  Through this book she learns more than she ever thought was possible and she grows and changes as she does it.  I can't give a lot of detail because I don't want to spoil this book for those who haven't read it.<br /><br />BUT if you liked the previous two books (the Hunger Games and Catching Fire) you will no doubt enjoy this.  Yourquestions will be answered.  Will it be Gail or Peeta?  Will Panem Fall? Will President Snow win?  Who is trust worthy and who is not?  Who exactly is on the sides of the Rebels?<br /><br />All will be answered you just have to pick up this captivating Compelling book to find out!
0307949508|5.0|Great second book-kept my interest through the very end of the book. If you like suspense and intrique, this series is for you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|You find Katniss at home and facing more danger.  Despite being a victor you discover that the road of the victor is perilous.  I Don't want to give to much away because honestly it is a fabulous Read.  ANd if you enjoyed the Hunger Games then you will love this book too.  If you haven't read the Hunger Games.  Go back and read it first.  You will miss a lot if you don't!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so fun you should get it NOW! I love it a lot you can get different. people you can get a girl or a boy.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|fantastic series and absolutely great way to watch it using Amazon.  I will continue to watch certain TV series using Amazon when they are not available on Netflix.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It started out like a Harlequin Romance but soon caught my interest with the twists and turns it took along the way.<br />Well written, giving the perspective of both the main characters.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I just love this app. It has many beautiful sounds and I sometimes play them at bed time. I love the water ones best. I do wish they could be made louder, my hearing isn't to good.  Over-all I would give this app 10 stars.

0765325950|1.0|I wanted to get this in Kindle format.  I caved and bought in hardcover--and it was missing pages 763-801!!!!!!  (Approximately.)  WTF!!!!  All the copies I've found have the same flaw.  So now I'm going to find a used copy instead.  If this had been available in Kindle, Harriet would've had a sale the day it came out.  Great job, Team Jordan.  Way to shoot yourselves in the foot.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Good reading, if you can make it through nearly the first half of the book. The author spends a great deal of time developing the main character and the characters background prior to the main thrust of the book. It was a good book overall and I'm glad I stayed with it to the end.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I really was torn, I loved the first book, The two of them had so much chemistry and love. This book however it was back and forth, love , hate, off and on, the fact he was with his ex and she was aware and he still did it regardless of the reasons was unbearabl, to see her heart breaking. By the end of the book I was disgusted and angry at him, and that he lied and killed. I was not happy and almost felt down, I don't know if I can read the next one. I couldn't even start reading another book for days after the end of this one. Too much whiplash...
B0063M22QO|4.0|wish there were some more complex screens.  most of these are quite easy to finish.  This is a good time filler, but not too challenging.  We still like it.

B007ACAJB6|5.0|If you like raw, simple blues then this is the album for you! ZZ Top has evolved with the times and their music today is not very close to the music they produced during their early years. I like this side of ZZ Top rather that the commercialized band they now have forced to be. Straightforward blues both slow and fast, great album!
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|How many quarters did you waste on playing this old favorite? How many times did your bases get destroyed? Now, you can recapture the endless nights of your misspent youth in those late-night arcades, plunking quarter after quarter into classics like Missile Command, Zaxxon, Centipede, Donkey Kong, etc.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book has generally been described as a &#34;chick&#34; book and one that emphasizes sexual behavior in lurid detail. Some women may like the book and it does contain a lot of detailed descriptions of sexual behavior. But I found the overall plot to be about a struggle between two strong personalities to shape a relationship on terms acceptable to each party. And it is fascinating to watch this plot unfold. The sex is there because it is central to the relationship and because each party has a different approach to it. It is not an end in itself. Ana sees sex in a more romantic way than does Christian, who is used to being a sexual dominant to fulfill his psychological needs created by his early upbringing. She wants &#34;more&#34;; he does not see the need for &#34;more&#34;. I just finished the second book in the trilogy and cannot wait to get started on the third one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Like Pigment, you need to get your colors from one point to another in as few moves as possible. It isn't easy, but it definitely entertaining.
B008JC9ZYS|5.0|Skeletons & Majesties Live, released in 2013, is a concert Blu-Ray from the legendary German Power Metal band Gamma Ray, taken from their 2012 performance in Pratteln, Switzerland. Like fellow Power Metal band Stratovarius' recent Blu-Ray, this concert captures the last time the band would play with their longest serving drummer, in this case the superb Dan Zimmerman.<br /><br />It's a brilliant looking and sounding concert that clocks in at 2hrs 12min. The mix and sound in general are absolutely spot-on and really suits the band's style. Everything is perfectly clear and balanced and it's a real joy to listen to. For example, the keys are neither too overpowering or indeed inaudible, the vocals are just the right volume, the kick drum is loud and punchy and overall it all just has a nice powerful sound as a whole. The only nitpick is that the audience aren't audible often, so when the band gets them to sing along it looks a bit like the audience don't know the words, but with such a brilliant product overall that's scarcely a problem.<br /><br />The whole thing looks great too. They even put a lot of effort into the stage design, lighting and dry ice, this is no cheap affair. The picture for the most part is absolutely crystal clear (unless the stage lighting is interfering with the cameras).<br /><br />The best thing about the whole affair is the tasteful and clean editing style. It isn't bogged down in fancy effects or screen overlays too much, the shots don't change so frequently you get motion sickness and miss all the guitar solos, and it never seems like the visuals just serve the director's artistic vision rather than giving the fans what they want. Best of all the video and audio are perfectly synced. Sometimes concert films can get a little spoiled by the editing, but this one was handled just perfectly.<br /><br />The performance from the band is absolutely brilliant and the band seem to be absolutely loving every minute, it's a really fun performance, with a great atmosphere. Kai is a good front-man and gets the crowd involved as well as making little fun comments here and there about his bandmates. Dan hammers away at the drum kit energetically and the guitarists pull of some amazing solos and complex riffs and time shifts masterfully. Henjo even breaks out some high quality lead vocals briefly.<br /><br />Kai's former Helloween bandmate Michael Kiske comes onstage for three songs, adding his distinctive singing to 'Time To Break Free' 'A While In Dreamland' and a cover of Heloween's 'Future World.'<br /><br />The rest of the 20-track setlist (19 and an intro) is a mixture of stuff from all eras of the band's career, including the piano driven ballad 'Farewell,' and characterful acoustic reworkings of 'Rebellion In Dreamland' and 'Send Me A Sign.' The band mix fan-favourite tracks and some more obscure material, serious stuff and quirky stuff, fast stuff and slow stuff and it's a real treat to watch altogether.<br /><br />The bonus features include 22-minute of behind the scenes interviews with the roadcrew (in German), a 32-minute collection of archive footage from the early days, a six track additional concert from Zeche Bochum Germany (Tracklist: The Spirit, Wings Of Destiny, Farewell, Gamma Ray, Time To Break Free, Insurrection) and the Skeletons & Majesties EP as audio.<br /><br />As to the Blu-Ray specifics, this version is Region 0, Single Layer Blu-Ray, English Subtitles are available, the sound options are Dolby Stereo 2.0 or Dolby Surround 5.1, its standard is PAL and the aspect ratio is 16:9. My copy came in one of the slimmer Blu-Ray cases.<br /><br />Overall, this is a superb and hugely enjoyable Blu-Ray concert with a fantastic main feature and some nice bonus features. If you are a fan of the band I absolutely recommend it. To be perfectly honest I highly recommend this even if you aren't a fan of the band yet. If you find that you like Metal concert films in general, this is a worthwhile investment. It drips with effort and conviction and you couldn't realistically ask for a higher quality release.. It drips with effort and conviction and you couldn't realistically ask for a higher quality release.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|It seems possible that Eban's vision of heaven in its entirety occured upon reentry into consiousness on the seventh day, thus, contradicting the theory that it occurred during unconscious non brainstem activity, or what we are lead to beleive as the spirit.  Wish it were true but highly skeptical, even coming from a neuro surgeon.  Would be a must read if Dr Alexander could come back and address this.<br />griffkw@comcast.net

B009NPA3Y6|5.0|I bought this for my Grandmother who is an Avid Rolling Stones fan!  She loved the album and immediately through it in her car to listen to constantly!  When I received mine though, the case was slightly cracked.  Not a biggie, but packaging could have been a little better (no damage was done to the CD so I was happy).
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Wish I had played with this more but was put off by what looked like it requiring net access all the time unless you bought the subscription monthly/annually. I have to switch my access off at work and wanted to be able to review/ makes notes/checklists in folders. Been a long-term user of ColorNotes but always wished for a folder system to group items together. Found Evernote then dismissed it thinking it wouldn't work offline. But it does...and it rocks. And Evernote suggested Skitch app too, which is fun and useful. 6  yr old daughter loves that for<br /> drawing over photos and WHAM, Evernote loads them up to cloud, makes it easy to share them via email, social network etc. It may take me a little playing around to work out all of Evernote's features but now I know it will work offline, I am totally game to try...
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is a great book!!! I will definitely read it again to learn and pick up on the little things I might have missed.
B004JMSIRC|4.0|I'm not sure why Amazon no longer carries the two-disc version, because this is very clearly just disc 1 of that.  It says so right on the disc.  It's a good copy of the movie and does have a few sparse extras (like a 3D armor viewer, though the models therein are notably lower quality than those in the actual film) so if that's all you're looking for, you'll find it here.
B004LQI1PA|5.0|This film is a live recording of a concert version of the play, not the full production of the musical, so don't expect any acting. That's apparently due to the fact that full rights to the play are very expensive because of the recent movie. So the singers perform at microphones at the front of the stage.<br /><br />The singing is terrific and this format allows you to appreciate the music more. Especially after the singing of the actors in the movie, which was mostly mediocre but ranged from extremely good (especially the beautiful Samantha Barks as Eponine, who plays the same role in this concert version) to the truly awful off-tune attempts of Russel Crowe, a fine actor who should never sing outside the shower.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|it is no the best in the world but it is definitely in the upper ranks. great for people who want a farmville like game but not farmville.

B0058VW36U|3.0|My 3 year old was asking me for this game, it's fun for both of us but even though it claims to be ad-free there are annoying ads that pop up throughout the game. Since I paid for a game claining to be ad-free, the ads are a disappointment. I would have been willing to pay more for a truly ad-free game.

1936891026|5.0|I loved this book - so did my husband. It will be read more than once... or is that just me, finding another way to resist getting down to my work??<br /><br />So much of what Steven Pressfield describes in the first section on Resistance is recognizable - we all use these tricks at one time or another to avoid getting to work, whether it be writing, painting, or whatever our 'art' is. Recognizing the problem is the first step in finding the solution.<br /><br />If you're having trouble communing with your muse, you need this book.

0061124958|5.0|I read this book when I was in elementary school and have always enjoyed it. I have probably read this book over a hundred times. The book teaches children about friendship as well as love and compassion. The book is about a little girl who lives on a farm and adores animals. Wilbur was the runt of the pigs and ferns father wanted to shoot him. Fern was not going to let that happen. She raised Wilbur and fell in love with him. Wilbur was extremely talented and got along very well with all the animals. I loved how in the book it shows the relationship Wilbur has with all of the animals. It teaches children to adore animals. Not many chapter books have illustrations in them and this one does! It gives the children something to picture as well as something to keep their attention at! 5 stars for this book for sure!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A game to forget about the hussle and bussle of everyday life.<br />WARNING... PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. Can't pull away from it.
1591396190|2.0|Readers will find that 'Blue Ocean Strategy' by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne is an inspiring text. With several brief case studies, the single idea propagated throughout the book is that if you as a company delve into an \\"uncontested\\" product space and deliver to customers that highly sought after value (maybe in features or price), then you can somehow make the competition irrelevant. This notion seems so basic as to be obvious in today's competitive business world but I give the authors credit for expanding on the topic.<br /><br />The issue I have with this book is that business strategies/success stories of successful companies are used in a retrospective analysis to substantiate their ideas. This can be an easy fallacy to fall into. I would have liked to see the authors explore companies that did try to create those uncontested markets but miserably failed. It would have lent a bit more credibility to the book. A case in point - a decade ago, LEGO tried to do some novel things with their business by expanding into new territory, you know away from plastic building blocks to other kids' merchandise. The result? Revenues declined sharply by 25% and the CEO was fired.<br /><br />The point is that for an equal number of books that advice that companies stick to their core business, books like Blue Ocean will support creating uncontested spaces and new markets and so on. I think readers should judiciously read such books without getting deluded by fluff. Find out if it'll work for you first.
B008S4FZHI|2.0|Cornwell's Scarpetta character has become so negative that reading this novel was difficult. Alternatively Scarpetta is not answering Benton, or ignoring her niece, or harping on about Marino. The negativity makes the flow of the book difficult and not an enjoyable read.

B000FA675C|3.0|I had such high expectations for this book........after all, I am only 10 years late to the party and the movie (did not see it....I am not a fan of Tom Hanks and Ron Howard.....media darlings but boring and predictable in my eyes) was produced with a huge amount of fanfare, so I expected an enjoyable read.  After reading &#34;Angels & Demons&#34; and not finding it even moderately believable ( I loved the historical aspect of it though), I now looked at this book with a bit of a weary eye.........and it turns out for good reason.  Talk about flimsy characters and faulty plot lines............please, I found the twists and turns of the characters much too unacceptable.<br /><br />Without going through this page by page, I found that it suffers from much of the same ailments of the previous &#34;Angels & Demons&#34; with long winded explanations of unnecessary details that I found myself skipping through and unbelievable twists that just don't happen ever.  But the biggest complaint and most egregious sin that I have with this book is that it is basically a carbon copy of the last book.<br /><br />Come on, substitute the Louvre for the Vatican, substitute Vittoria for Sophie, Substitute Ventresca for Teabring....and so on........sure Dan Brown is not the first author to find a winning formula and stick to it......but in my eyes this was not a copy of just the formula, this was a copy of the exact plot line............I was very disappointed............I had high expectations for these two books and found them over written, redundant and in many places down-right unbelievable.  I will not call them a huge waste of time mainly because I enjoyed the historical aspect of the books, but without that angle, I would have been seriously upset with my choice of reading material.<br /><br />Be warned.......I think these books, like the movies, don't warrant the kind of excitement that the media threw at them.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I rated this book with four stars because it was a tad bit confusing in the first half of the book, but was great overall.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a book I couldn't put down. Pat is wonderfully written character. I hope the movie is as brilliant as this book. Recommendation, you must read!
B009YQJ322|4.0|Karl Urban, known for his role as Éomer in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" saga, is Judge Dredd, the ultimate law enforcement officer of the dystopian society of Mega-City One. Directed by Pete Travis (\\"Vantage Point\\") and written by Alex Garland (\\"28 Days Later...\\"), the new version is fast-paced, stylish and very violent. And it's very entertaining.<br /><br />The simple story of \\"Dredd\\" about a veteran-/rookie-cop duo is told with a slight touch of Dirty Harry thrown in. Karl Urban's Judge Dredd has to team up with a recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) in order to evaluate her competence as a Judge. This is virtually her first job, but Dredd and Anderson, trapped inside a 200-storey building ruled by a ruthless drug lord called \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headey), have to fight for survival, surrounded by gun-toting thugs.<br /><br />The premise may be a bit similar to that of \\"The Raid: Redemption,\\" but what is impressive about \\"Dredd\\" is its bloody gun fight scenes and stylized slow motion images. In fact, the sci-fi action is sort of a western set in futuristic post-apocalyptic America (actually shot in South Africa), and it works.<br /><br />Karl Urban is spot on as Judge Dredd and he clearly knows what fans would expect from the character (this time Dredd does not remove his helmet). Based on the graphic novel series (which was once made into a film about 17 years ago starring Sylvester Stallone and ... Diane Lane and Max von Sydow!), the 2012 version \\"Dredd\\" is an entertaining movie with more fights and more action.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game. I would recommend it to anyone who loves horses but doesn't have one of their own.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks, you will like this novel.  It is a love story with a few twists and turns.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is entertaining, exciting, and truthful. It kept me interested for hours, and it has a lot of memorable quotes. The letter form is new and original, especially since it is unknown who Charlie is writing to. There are some parts where nothing much is happening, but they're still interesting simply because of the way Charlie tells it. I'd recommend this book to anyone who asked.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I'm trying to think of something to compare this movie to, but all I can come up with is that it's kind of like Mean Girls, Glee, The House Bunny, and the Bring It On movies all rolled into one.  The story is one we've probably all seen before: girl meets boy while on the way to figuring out who she really is.  But what's different about this is that it's actually funny and there is some real musical talent here.  I'm not lying when I say that not only did I literally laugh out loud many times while watching it, but I also downloaded some of the songs from the soundtrack when I finished it.  This isn't the greatest movie of all time, but it is one I will definitely watch again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a great finish to the trio. Too bad there wasn't more love in the end. I was going for more life after the games
1451673442|5.0|This is a great read to lift the spirit and bring change to your world. A truly magic book to read
0810993139|5.0|This book is great for kids on the edge of Chapter books. Some pictures but actually alot of content. Very funny and written like a kid thinks.  The next step after Captain Underpants which I wasn't crazy about. I will probably get the entire series.
1439181780|5.0|Another book that leaves you feeling good and ready for more positive to keep you going. Thank you Rhonda Byrne you are fantastic.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|You will watch this one over and over !  Intelligent and very well done !  AND watch for the homage to Kirk Douglas's 'The Vikings'.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Entertaining  and easy to play.  I like passing the time in my little cafe.  I think children may enjoy this more as I'm probably too old for it lol.
0812974611|5.0|Love this book !  Very insightful look at the Roman lifestyle and the water systems that gave the Romans such a resplendent life. I highly recommend this book.
B000031XCR|5.0|I am a great big fan so you know how I must feel having her cd within my hands! Super fast delivery I love it thanks!
B009POCG0Y|5.0|If you identify with any of these characters you need to draw a warm bath, get in, and make good use of a razor blade !  Great movie but disturbing !  McConaughey brings it to table !  I gain more respect for him with every movie he makes.  Be prepared - Gina Gershon like you have never seen her (and more of her than you dreamed).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really love this great game it keeps me occupied wen I got nothing else to do like at 12:00 at night
B001675YQ6|5.0|Loved this movie, partly because of Brittany Murphy but the characters were really great.... she had some crazy friends... movie was satirical but very enjoyable... I would recommend this film to anyone...
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This is my favorite show anyway but this not was magical.  What a fabulous cast and superbly done.  An extra thrill at the end with all the stars that made this show so superb. Not to be missed.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Definitely a 5-star production in its first season.  I intended to not watch this series - Watson, a woman? Give me a break! - but I broke down and watched it because I am Holmes fan and I had to see what all the full was about.  The show gives us a 21st century take on Holmes - a self-absorbed genius with obsessive behaviors who's on the brink of self-destruction.  And Watson, a female surgeon who's lost her nerve after a tragic death on her operating table.  Watson is Holmes' sober companion, and they find in each other the strength to keep going and a fresh start.  There are nods to the classic stories.  (Could Holmes exist without Sebastian Moran or Moriarty?)  But the new look at Holmes' extreme behavior, and Watson's faithful friendship and refusal to be pushed around by the on-edge genius, are well worth watching.  The crime scenes are true-to-life gory (which I could do without sometimes), but it's a real-world story that brings our beloved character very much to life. Bravo to the crew who put this series together.  Stay true to Season One and I'll continue to be a fan.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|If you like Andrea Bocelli (and who doesn't), you will want to have this one in your collection.  Once again he is terrific.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I gave 4 because at first it had the wrong time. It was weird but still a great app. I really like it. :)
0865478007|1.0|Another author that is out to 'expose' a problem that will change the world. Wait, I mean line their pockets. Biased research, biased writing and likely to be the first one to extend a hand to drug companies when knocking on the door of chronic illness. Polar views and little real world balance make this book a serious disappointment.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Never able to get this to work on my android tablet...first had to download Amazon app market but it still wouldn't install...couldn't you make it easier?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story.  It was very well written and entertaining. I have recommended this to all my friends who enjoyed Hunger Games, Divergent, etc... Great book!!!!
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|Exciting movie. A little confusing at times. Wish the ending was a little more detailed. Good movie and shows a love that many people don't find in marriage any more. No objectionable scenes or language.
B0000072TX|2.0|Hi, sorry. I don't hate or dislike the product you sent, me, you just sent me the wrong product. You have shown, and listed Pearl Jam Ten, the Japanese import. I received a two disc reissue that is not the correct product. Would you please send me the product advertised instead?
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee does a great job remembering the horiffic events of her kidnapping as a your child.  It was very heart wrenching at times but wonderful to hear how she has healed.
B001IF252M|5.0|I bought this adapter, it came in the mail.<br />I attached it to an old LCD monitor, it works fine.<br />All is well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn has twists and turns at every chapter which makes this book hard to put down.  Wonderful book for vacation!
