B0086700CM|5.0|it was sooooooooo much fun I couldn't take my eyes of it. get it get it get it get it!!!!!!!!!!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I read the critics and almost didn't watch this movie. The current trend of bashing and trolling everything as being less than perfect realLy effects the comments here unfortunatly.  They are crying about the movie not being \\"perfect\\" or up to their \\"fanboy imagination\\" \\"standards\\"...weak. GRAB SOME POPCORN AND DIM THE LIGHTS... this movie is worth your time. And just like in life, ignore the obnoxious comments from the loud and the few.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|First off a disclaimer, my favorite band of all time is Deep Purple. However, as a longtime KISS fan, first I would say this is not thier worst effort as the 1 star people have said, nor is it a classic like the early\mid seventies releases. What you get with Monster is effort, they were trying to make a good album-not the best tunes\not the worst. What KISS really needs at this stage of thier career is to find a producer other than Paul-he sucks!! Paul may know the the sound he wants, but he can't get it to gel with the line up he is working with. I liked Sonic Boom as well! I have often wondered what a Mutt Lange produced album with the original KISS line up would sound like-probaly awesome!!!
B008R9N7CO|4.0|This was a very funny movie.  It's not as funny as Borat, but that was a classic.  From the trailers, people should have an idea of what type of movie this is.  The complaints about the low jokes is ridiculous.  I dare you to watch the extended Nadal scene and not laugh.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|A fascinating, lucid and horrific account of the out-of-control greed that brought disaster to our society in 2008. Lewis' ability to explain arcane financial \\"instruments\\" is excellent, but his ability to highlight the depth of the moral corruption in the world of high finance is unparalleled. An excellent book that should be read and understood by everyone.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I like all the videos at your fingertips from Top 40 to 80s and also like that it continues playing videos in the genre after the selected video. Seems to have an unlimited supply of artists and videos but constant Force Close issues on all videos other than those found in the stock categories. With some fixes this could be a big winner.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and cannot wait until December 31st when the trilogy finale releases. This series is as good if not better than 50 Shades. Don't get me wrong I loved 50 too!! ***sigh*** I am a hopeless romantic!!<br /><br />Ps...if you read this book make sure to read Reflected in You!!!
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|I apologize in advance this isn't really a review of the movie. I just can't believe how frequently older reviews ...
B004I744AS|5.0|it is a great and convienient reference to have on hand, I really did not expect much of it, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried it out.  I recommend it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Works well on my kindle but will not link up with facebook so I can't find new friends to pin off of. Lots of great ideas. Wish I could do them all.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Really crap. Poor storyline. So not worth the hype. Do not waste your time. One wondoers why all this money was wasted on this screenplay.
B00003CWTI|4.0|I loved reading the reviews on this one. Some really loved it, others really hated it. Some in between, too. I would not call it great, but I really did like it. It's hard to believe it was over 3 hours long. I thought EVERY actor was VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. And I was never bored. I do think it was kinda' strange. I would only recommend this one selectively. The word PRETENTIOUS came up often in the negative reviews. I do not agree with that. Different yes, pretentious no. Not for everyone on a number of levels. Die Hard it's not.<br />It is difficult for me to understand how anyone could find Tom Cruise' performance anything other than stellar. I really liked John C Reilly in this, and I normally don't. Macy was fabulous and so was Moore. Robards was really good and so was Hoffman. A really great cast, and EVERYONE was at the top of their acting game. BRAVO.
1401234542|4.0|I'm new to the Green Lantern series, so I figured the New 52 Vol 1 would be a great place to start, and it is!  I had a basic understanding of Green Lantern before reading the book (saw the 2011 movie with Ryan Reynolds, and have a basic understanding of Hal Jordan, Sinestro, the Green and Yellow Lanterns).  The story seems to pick up at the end of a previous arc, but with that being said, I never really felt lost...it was pretty easy to figure out what was going on.  The artwork is very well-done (with one exception, which I will touch on in a moment) and the story was well-written.  My only complaint is that I liked about 83% of the whole book, which means I liked issues #1-5, but not issue #6.  (Vol 1 is a collection of issues #1-6.)  Issues #1-5 had the same artist, but in issue #6 a new artist took over, and the characters looked different enough for me to be confused on what was happening.  Hal looked about 15 years younger in issue #6, but it didn't go back in time.  Sinestro looked like he put on about 30 lbs between issues #1-5, but issue #6 took place right after issue #5.  So, with the exception of issue #6, which didn't seem to fit in the book, or the story arc, for that matter, I still enjoyed Vol 1.  If you're on the fence about it, go to your local library and see if they have it instead of buying it.  Hope this helps!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I've had issues with off brand playstation controllers in the past but sony is a great product and outdoes them all!
B001D0DQUC|3.0|I ordered the \\"classic movie\\" that I remember from my childhood and that's why I ordered it...LOVE THE MOVIE !! BUT, I paid more in shipping than I did for the movie...I got the movie within 2 days (which I don't remember clicking, I think it automatically choose THAT option) but I didn't NEED TO HAVE THE MOVIE THAT QUICKLY !! I would have rather waited 2 weeks and paid less in shipping, so would I buy from this seller again...probably not !! Movie was in excellent condition.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book so much!!!! i read it 2 times!!!! i would also read the first to books of the series the hunger games and catching fire  i read the hunger games 4 times and catching fire twice!!!! this is the best series ever!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am surprised that I found this book so captivating.  The characters are despicable and the writing not particularly skillful.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game, its easier to play than to play at the fair. the only difference is that they don't have walls..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A definite page-turner! excited for the other books and to see what else is in store for katniss and peeta
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun and entertaining from the get go. fun for all ages but addictive. cant wait to get my coins and prizes to level up. very fun to play. keeps the kids busy too.
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|Pre-ordered the movie after seeing it in theaters. Movie is excellent. The discs however are not.<br /><br />1. Digital Copy Cannot Play in windows media player!<br />2. They don't give a phone number for support, if you already have this it is 1-800-723-4763<br />3. you can forget the digital copy of the sound track, there is no way to download it or get the music files<br /><br />So all in all, if you want this movie, just buy the dvd & blu ray and forget the disney digital bull. I might be returning this bundle myself shortly.
B0013YPEMG|5.0|When I bot the movie I was glade that I bot it.<br />I got admit the joke in this movie was true about himself<br />Even my mother like the original joke in the origin batman.<br />I know I like the movie!!:)
B00589AYWW|5.0|Tuchman is renowned for her history books, which shed light on historical subjects, but in this book, in my opinion, she outdoes the rest of her books. Someone has written in one of the coments on her book that this book is \\"not for those that have no real experience with intellectual historical study\\". Well, I think quite the contrary. I read it in my twenties, with no such experience, and felt it was insightful and extremely interesting. Tuchman demonstrates how time and again throught hitory, governments of whatever type of regime, act against their own interests, although they have a real better alternative. How insightful and relevent, and how interesting it has ben for me to learn! The examples are detailed and well presented, in a way that has kept me anxiously reading throughout the book. Tuchman doesn't state anywhere in the book (like somone wrote in his review) that they acted like that 'becuase they were stupid'. She merely demonstrates a symptom she calls 'folly' of governmnets, and its devastating results that could eesily have been avoided. That reader, who has rebuked Tuchman for not trying to understand the motives of those governments, has in my opinion missed the point: there is not reason, their behaviour is irrational, since human behavior is in many cases irrational (and prof. Daniel Kahneman has won Nobel prize for proving that). Governments are made of people, and therefore are perfectly capable of acting irrationally. The observation on Tuchman's behalf is, in my opinion, brilliant, and for me this book was an excellent and unique read.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I haven't read Philippa Gregory in a long time but I picked up this book and was reminded how much I love her.  I loved this book right up until the very end.  The only part I didn't like was the end because I literally turned the page expecting more but it was over.  It didn't seem like an \\"end\\" to me.  I found this book to be a quick read but maybe that is because I couldn't put it down.
067144901X|5.0|My toddler and 4 year old both love this story! It is simple and fun. Of course, like all Boynton books it rhymes!

PEOPLE KEPT SAYING IT IS A SEX BOOK - NO IT'S NOT IF YOU REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ARE READING - YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE IS A GREAT STORY BEHIND IT.

ALL THE OBSTACLES THAT HE WENT THRU - IT WAS GREAT.<br /><br />THERE ARE ALOT OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR THE NEXT ONE.

0316056863|3.0|Instead of an essay, let's just highlight the main points here.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Tina's sharing of her experiences growing up, at Second City and some of her stories about SNL. It is a truly fascinating look Fey's life through her eyes at each stage of her personal evolution and why she holds the public opinions she voices.<br /><br />- The book is funny as often it is written in a tone very similar to Tina's not-so-different screen persona, Liz Lemon. Contrary to some reviews here, however, it is not laugh 'till you hurt funny. It's smile at the \\"isn't that clever\\" wordplay and humor. Those finding it side splitting are either much too easily entertained or simply trying too hard to make Fey's charmingly snarky remarks far more humorous than they really are. Don't be disappointed if you buy the book banking on it being the best laugh you've ever had -- it likely won't be and would be sad if it was.<br /><br />- Tina does a wonderful job of painting the portrait of her family growing up -- and how they are today. Especially impressive is her presentation of her father -- a type we all know and can't help but respect. Much too often memoirs are used to bellyache about the minutia and minor differences that \\"scarred\\" an upbringing. Tina does not do this and makes the book more personal and engaging for taking the high road.<br /><br />- Interesting stories about the actual making of SNL and 30 Rock episodes. Also a Fey gives a solid feel of just how demanding and chaotic putting together the pieces of a show can be behind the scenes. Her retelling of the Oprah-Pailin-Birthday Party stress storm gives a real glimpse into what a near-impossible juggling act it all can be.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- The meandering nature of some of the anecdotes she shares. Tales from a cruise ship, photo shoots and a rambling chapter of indecision about having second child particularly stand out as mostly filler.<br /><br />- Tina's incessant and nauseating butt-kissing of Lorne Michaels and Alec Baldwin. Yes, at the time she wrote the book her tenure at 30 Rock was uncertain, so little groveling might have felt in order -- but c'mon. Also, her particularly ponderous reverence given to the \\"craft\\" of Amy Pohler. Yes, they are longtime friends so that can be expected to some degree -- but she makes Amy seem like modern day legend. Pohler's writing and gross-out attempts with the boy's club at SNL seem only to contradict Fey's \\"conquering the plight of the empowered female writer\\" sermon.<br /><br />- Fey's \\"who, me?\\" approach to the whole Sarah Pailin stint at SNL. Pretending as if she was merely pushed into the part and any controversy that arose from that role was entirely misinterpretation of good intention. C'mon Tina -- we've seen what you've written for years at SNL and 30 Rock and you choose to hang out with Alec Baldwin at work all day. We have a pretty good idea of where you sit politically and that a chance to sway voters had to be in the back of your beloved little head. Just admit you loved it.<br /><br />- Tina's halfhearted run down of her co-workers at 30 Rock. We're treated to so much as a sentence or two that predictably tell us what we pretty much already know (or think we know) about her current cast. Yes, we understand you can't really tell us how crazy Tracy Morgan is or what a nice-guy act Jack McBreyer has mastered at the moment -- so don't. Save that for Bossypants 2 -- when you've moved on from beneath the thumb of NBC and can really vent.<br /><br />All in all, Bossypants is an entertaining and interesting read, though the rave reviews do seem pointedly overzealous for a book so disjointed and underwhelming at times. Still, it's definitely worth a look if you're embarking on a cross-country flight or just have some time to kill during the kids' soccer practice.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|was very nice keep's kindle fire safe and clean use it all the time thanks so much .It was A gift to me from my neice
B0063IH60K|1.0|There first thing I saw was an ad. I know nothing is free but I'm tired of too many ads.So...Uninstall  finished
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This was a great video.The acting was superbe and the subject matter was important in that it addresses the issue of death in a very real and mature fashion. Since we are spiritual beings, it is vitally important that we understand our spiritual doimensions, in addition to the Physical and Mental aspects. There can be no inner growth unless this subject is dealt with in a comprehensive fashion. I'd recommend that it be part of the general library educational system in every city and every state. Thank you.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game. its fun to not only create but also run your own town. great to pass the time.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This app is just like having the standard edition in hardback. This is truly an asset to any electronic application. It has all the bells and whistles just as the one you would have on a pc.
0525953728|5.0|An easy read that is a great tribute to the unnamed heros of this country. Worth the purchase because half the proceeds go toward charity.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Not up to Reacher standards. Predictable. The one man attack at the end was confusing in that the description of the quonset fortress was muddled. The attack scenario was totally unbelievable.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Just got the E6 5hrs ago, and I was really excited until I NOTICED THAT THIS THING IS CRAPPY AS HELL! After unboxing it, i tried to turn it on but i couldn't. I thought maybe the battery was all the way dead, so i plugged it in to charge it. Red light was blinking rapidly when it was charging. I could turn it on and use it while charging. I was happy. After 3 hrs, still blinking red light. I unplugged it to use it. BUT I CANT TURN IT ON. I CHARGED IT LIKE 3 TO 4 HRS BUT CAN\\"T EVEN TURN IT ON! ALL I WATEND TO SEE WAS SHINY BLUE LIGHT FROM THE LED AND YOU SENT ME THE BROKEN PIECE?!?!  How could you do that to me :( Later, I read on a website, saying that blinking red light means bad battery....you don't even know how I was excited when i got this from UPS and now it's..sigh...Imma return this this
0811877485|5.0|So colourful! Loved them, Great to colour up a room or play area! And remove without damage to the walls!
B008XG1X18|5.0|i really enjoy all of the fun things i can find on here! i get so many good ideas for things to do with my daughter!
B004GGTAQE|5.0|This book is highly detailed with a first hand accounting of major battles fought by a top notch tank ace and a true gentleman against the Russians on the North-Eastern Front and Americans at toward the end of the war. Otto Carius espouses the attributes of a trustworthy, competent and caring leader. Excellent book!
B008KZVNLC|4.0|Watch out - this is a REGION 2 DVD! I did not see this particular DVD - but know this great series from watching it on TV.  I recommend the series, but you must be aware that a Region 2 DVD cannot be viewed in the United States.  This DVD is not yet available in the United States.  So if you live here beware.<br />  Also, it is not a \\"collectible\\" and it is overpriced.  You can go to BBCShop.com and get the same DVD (though it will be Region 2) for £17.00 which is about $22.05 USD.
034580404X|4.0|I was throughly pleased with my purchase of the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  I could not put these books down!! I went through all three within two weeks!<br /><br />I did enjoy the first and second book the best. I felt like the third book rushed to the end.  The erotic parts were a bit \\"cheesey\\" but the rest of the plot was surprisingly intriguing.  I would recommend buying for sure!
0345803507|5.0|i am not a romance reader , but these came with a referral from some ones MOTHER .lol. and could not pass up on at least a read , and what can i say , read ALL THREE from start to finish without a break. lol. took them every where i went and make you want to ead the next page , even after your eyes are bleeding .lol. could not put them down and only thing i would add BOOK FOUR .lol.
B0000541AM|5.0|i dont know which copy i got, but there are no \\"comic\\" partitions or whatever on mine. this is cl;early not high brow.  this is basically batman  without the \\"pow\\" and \\"bam\\"  stuff.  its v. dated and the beginning is a bit slow for my taste. this is a puzzling movie to ponder over...or write about.  i didnt check the ratings or reviews before i watched this. i graduated in '80 and i dont remember this movie AT ALL....just the poster which i thought was pretty  f n cool. i wont reveal anything relevent about the plot to spoil it for others...but i give this director credit for this movie. of course its idiotic.  but the formula tends to work. i just dont see how you could make the original dictation work in a scary...bizzare way as it was intended to do. rather this becomes more of a escape/fighting movie. it works. its interesting watching each scene come together. also dont forget that there are no major stars in this movie. ( the black dude from the warriors is remembered as  prium) from the fabulous NORTH SOUTH epic.  mike becks face is familiar...but i dont remember him too much. this film gets a big thumbs up for very limited graphic gore....almost non existent. i would let my young ones watch this with some supervision. as a final compliment to the powers that be in the writing...a really nice job in  NOT inciting RACIAL tension....opting rather for \\"interesting styles\\" rather than inflaming racism......good job folks!

B009FO908A|1.0|This song and video is clearly unoriginal taken from BTRs Windows Down. I advise never buy any of 1Ds terrible music
0525953728|5.0|This book was far greater than I expected. It was so detailed and descriptive, I couldn't put it down. Great job to Matt for writing it; there will probably never be anything like it again!
B006OITIQE|1.0|One direction are terrible singers I advise never buy a song or album of theirs. If any boy band is good, its Big Time Rush not 1D
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Yet another great album from Mumford and Sons. It provides the right combination of upbeat songs and more relaxed songs. Now I just need to see these guys live!
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|This album has music you would never have expected from BTR and has infectious beats everyone will love! Cant wait for their 3rd album!!!
B004LQEYAG|4.0|This movie was funny, cool, and the ending was absolutly epic.  There were some parts that were kinda wierd (romantic bike rides for instance), but, when the movie got serious, it was very good.  That said, if you are looking to watch a traditional western movie, this is not it.  It just lacked the rugged wild west feel.  Still I would reccomend it.
B007G5K066|5.0|While the high-action spy movies keeps us all entertained, this is one of the best movies (story written by a real-life spy) to reveal the real color and feel of the British intelligence on the 1970's Cold War. I was completely amazed at the twist of plot. Great movie.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|A little repetitive, less variety than Sigh No More, but hey, if you're doing it right, why not keep doing it? Love it.
0785152458|5.0|I'm a fan of the first Kick-Ass, the movie, and now this. It is very entertaining and has great characters, plot, and artwork. It's sort of a meta-comic, and that adds a layer of satire to it, but it also holds it's own as a story. It's obviously not for the very conservative folk, though. Basically, if you think swearing, violence (towards both adults and children), blood, murder, and rape are too much for you to handle, this isn't for you. There were parts when even I audibly said \\"Holy sh*t\\". But, if you can understand that it's just a comic book, and everything that's done isn't simply done for \\"shock value\\", you're in for a treat. An incredibly dark yet entertaining original graphic novel, Kick-Ass 2 holds up to it's predecessor, and leaves you wanting more.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie. However, I felt that DiNero didn't fit the character, since he's been type casted in so many other movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|They should put herobrine on a update cause I want to see him on my kindle fire also it should be just like the Pc I have it for kindle fire of.course and I have it for xbox and it will be cool if it had all Pc stuff on pocket edition do you know how cool it will be
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Being a former Marine I looked forward to reading this book.  Then, I ran into a problem - I couldn't stop reading it.  The wife yelled it was dinner time and I missed dinner.  The wife said our favorite TV show was on and I missed it.  Outstanding read and highly recommended.  Oh yeah, then the wife starting reading it!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I am always looking for new books to read, and paranormal romances that do not have a strong story line tend to have me putting down the books after the first couple of chapters. This books story line, with its clockwork world of vamps, had me hanging on to every word and every chapter. I did not want it to end. I feel that alot of people will really like this books twists,turns and surprises. It is well worth the ride :)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I find it really hard to find sci fi stories that I like and can get into.  This story is totally believable, with likable characters that you root for.  I hope that the author continues to write stories of the same type, and I look forward to reading more of his current works.  This is a really good bargain for a great book that will capture your imagination.<br />The only critical thing I can say about it is that I found myself skipping over some pages in a hurry to find out what happens next.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I love season 1 of Smash, it is very easy to go to my video library and watch whatever episode I want whenever I want.<br />Definetly recomend.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved reading this book! It grabbed me from the beginning and I just wanted to keep reading. Never a dull moment with Pigeon and Travis around!
B005WGBOZM|5.0|Great sound and picture. no stops stalls. Thinking about getting the whole season. I watched it in HD and it was amazing. Thanks Amazon!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|OK, all my female co-workers went on and on. \\"You've got to read these books!\\", \\"You've never read anything so sexy in your life!\\", \\"Can't put it down!\\". Sounded like tripe to me, so I still didn't read it. Finally my friend lent me the books making me promise to read all 3.<br /><br />Well........I'm going to have to break that promise, sorry friend. I made it half way through the second book (medal please), and I simply can't read on. I was right, it is badly written tripe.  E.L. James, you are no writer. Anyone who's a fan of good literature, do not bother with these books. Unless you've run out of sleeping pills.<br /><br />The characters are unbelievable, corny, and seemed to have no depth. If it was written about cardboard cut-outs, I would've understood why they were so bland.<br /><br />The writer treats you like you're stupid, always telling you what they're thinking after every sentence. Get this, we can tell what they're thinking from the diaglogue, you don't have to write their thoughts every 5 seconds.<br /><br />The sex was laughable. Honestly, they last about a minute each time, and it is exactly the same each time. The point of a good erotic read is that the hero should be a better lover than men in real life, not worse. YAWN.<br /><br />I didn't spend any money on this book, but I'm still ticked off i wasted my time.<br /><br />I could have plenty more to say, but I'll leave you with this one thought to ponder = WHAT THE HELL IS WITH ALL THE 'MY SUBCONCIOUS DID THIS WHILE MY INNER GODDESS DID THAT' CRAP. It was completely irritating, juvenile, and.......just......why the hell would you do that?!
B009OYT4FU|1.0|I bought the video but can't watch it?  Sorry for the 1 star because Amazon has a problem, but since I paid for something I can't watch (without downloading.  Want to stream), I guess that's what we're going with.  I can, of course, spend ANOTHER $3 and get HD.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|It had great potentail.  All the funny parts are in the previews.  Watched 45 mins but it was SOOO boring I just turned it off.  I don't know how it ended and it wasn't even worth looking up the ending.
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Love this show. As always, acting and storyline are excellent.  Five stars hands down.  I can't wait to start Season 5.  This is my favorite show of all time.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|What a horrible movie!  Couldn't connect with any characters.  They go looking for a planet because of same cave scribbles.  They find it and are attacked by aliens.  Lead woman is impregnated by said aliens.  Everyone dies but her.  END.
B005D63ICI|5.0|I love this show. As always, the acting and storyline are excellent.  Five stars hands down.  I can't wait to start Season 6.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I love Mitch's books, they always given me such food for thought. This was boring and hard to follow. I finished the book, but it was a chore.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|This was a thoroughly enjoyable and interesting book filled with brilliant moments of insight into human nature. It was one of the best books I have read in a while and such a pleasure to read after the poor \\"Gone Girl\\" that everyone was raving about. Jennifer Egan managed to have you rooting for all the numerous flawed characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is my favorite game and ive been playing for 2 years including Pc version but one flaw I have foundbis that the green wool dye when its in ur hand it looks like bone meal :P but over all thebbest game u could own totally worth the $7
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Very well designed and written. I couldn't leave the game and played for 3 hours straight.<br />I like the physics, changing gravity and types of birds.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Absolutely love this movie! My step daughter has never seen it before,so purchased two! Timing of delivery was awesome,thank you so very much
B008MM9630|5.0|I have this game on Mac and when I found it on the kindle fire I was so happy. Do not listen to other reiwers who say they can't get it load or it keeps freezing. It is an awesome game and it works fine for me. Good to have a lot of patience with these kind of games though, as you will need to wait awhile to harvest things. Gems are an optional purchase. You can still play the game fine without them. Do get this game as it is quite enjoyable!
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I realize that no film could ever compare with the book, but that being said, this film left out significant moments from the book. For one thing, there isn't enought foreshadowing of the madwoman in the attic. In fact, in the book the madwoman creeps into Jane's room the night before the wedding, rips her wedding veil, and holds a candle to Jane's face and blows it out. This is one of the most frightening moments in this gothic/romantic novel, and it is left out in the film. Grace Poole as a character is practically absent, and her presence is important bc Rochester tells Jane that Grace is responsible for the mysterious happenings at night. The courtship between Mr. R and Jane is too rushed and comes across as unbelievable. I showed this film to my students and they were completely shocked when Mr. R proposed, which demonstrates the lack of romantic chemistry the actors had in the film. If you had no knowledge of JE before seeing the film, then the characters' relationship would not be convincing. I liked the flashback technique and the film was visually beautiful, but other than that it does not measure up the the book. The best version I've seen is the Masterpiece Theatre mini-series. Even then, they always make the madwoman beautiful with messed up hair when in reality she is horrifying. Unfortunately this film also strayed from the book in this regard.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've been a faithful follower of RUSH since Fly By Night Album. This Album, although somewhat similar to Snakes and Arrows, is the pure sound that everyone loves. It's a reflection of life and what we need to learn by it. They have such a wide range of rock to ballad that leaves you wanting more. The lyrics are typical RUSH that adds depth and makes you think about what your listening to.  Awesome album that has it all, a must have!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I'd forgotten just how much of this takes place in two countries at once and how Jonathan being alone made the whole thing creepier. A really good read, not jump up scary, but also not a great idea right before bed.

B003O86FMW|5.0|It is the second book of three and very well written. It is hard to put down once you start. I would recommend this book also after reading the first book which was as well written.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I bought this CD with some trepidation, I have been a bit disappointed lately with Barbra's choice of material. Don't get me wrong, the woman can still sing and I love to hear her but buying an album of 12 or so songs and all of them sounding alike was a bit much for me.  All the slow tempos and strings, heavy orchestrations just get a bit boring to me.  I sit there wondering why someone didn't inject a bit of spark or  excitement into the records.  THIS new batch of songs is just that.  They sparkle with the old Streisand sparkle.  They sound alive and luscious.  I must admit I think we have gotten a bit spoiled with Ms. Streisand's work, I mean really, who can even cut an album like her on her worst day.  NO ONE.  Barbra is in a class by herself.<br />Some of the recordings have included the patter between Barbara and her engineer or musician, I love it.  It gives just a glimpse into what went on in that sacred recording booth. The songs are an eclectic mix.  They range in differences in color, mood and texture,  as of now I do not have a favorite.  I do like the studio version of \\"With One More Look At You\\" and the one on \\"Mother\\" both are very nice and I played them over after hearing the first time.<br />This CD is a treasure, it is difficult to believe these were not going to see the light of day until now. Thanks Barbra for letting us in the vault.  As is lead to in the notes, lets her volume two, three, four, five and ...........

B008RTE09S|1.0|This review is for the song content only. This is for those who will purchase this 2012 release for the 5.1 Surround treatment of the 5 songs in this film. This is also for those who thought that this would be as great as 1999's Yellow Submarine 5.1 mixes. REAL BAD NEWS HERE! 99% of the rear channel content is mostly reverb. There is almost nothing in the rear channels that is not in the front. The producer for this restoration was none other than Giles Martin (who created the fantastic 5.1 Love soundtrack in 2006). This 5.1 mix is just terrible and a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. However, I will give this 1 star because of the clarity of the mixes and the resulting bits of voices and instruments that you may not have heard in these songs before now.

B008Y2IU12|3.0|The original Snow White was a story told to relate the difference between innate and physical beauty in a woman. Kristen Stewart, though fairly good as the princess avenging her family and her kingdom from evil, misses one important element that makes Snow White who she is and that's joy. The whole weight of Snow White's beauty doesn't rest with her innocence or pretty face but with her inner joy, love of life and compassion. Stewart doesn't bring these elements to the role but remains dour through the entire film. The strength of a Snow White is that she can inspire love from all around her because she carries that happy lightness of being within, the fairy tale itself rests on the idea that a woman's beauty is in her innate qualities and attitude not her physical beauty; in short women cannot command love just because they are physically attractive. By contrast the performance of Charlize Theron as the queen is awesome. Theron balances everything perfectly and subtly portrays what drives the queens character. The queen symbolizes a woman who cannot love and so cannot be loved because of some grave hurt that has twisted her heart and her character, she's supposed to hate Snow White not just because she's pretty but because she's happy and loved. Theron shows a woman who is dependent on the power of physical beauty because she cannot exude it from inside. She feels used, hurt, lonely, angry and vengeful the opposite qualities that makes Snow White snow white which is why she's told by her magic mirror that if she takes the princesses heart she will live and remain beautiful forever. I would have given this four stars, maybe even five if the story was properly portrayed but it wasn't and I cannot tell if its the fault of the director or lack of emotional in Stewart herself.  As for those who felt the triangle between Snow White, the huntsman and William was left unresolved you are all mistaken. The idea is that the Queen's power over Snow White can only be broken through true love, when Prince william kisses her she remains dead, when the Huntsman kisses her she is restored, so we know from this that Snow White's heart rests with the huntsman and not William.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Love, love, love this movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|From the beginning I was hooked and couldn't stop reading!  I loved the author's storyline and the characters clicked with me right away.  I finished it the day the sequel came out... you will want to get the next book right away too, you won't want to quit after this first book!
B00866H7SS|5.0|Just loved the characters in the book. Gideon Cross sounds so strong and yet so vunerable. Loved the passion and the strength of Eva. Enjoyed their developing relationship and also knowing there was more to come in the next novel. Highly recommend this book.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|What can I say?  Ken  Follett does it again.  I will never tire of his writing style, his detailed and accurate historical references, or his wide array of authentic, powerful characters.  Bravo.
B00821PCJS|5.0|At first I was a little disappointed that the series didn't start from day 1 of the invasion but soon got over it; the visual effects are very well done and I love the character development/plot lines. I watched all of season 2 as the episodes aired and was curious to see it from the beginning. Can't wait for season 3!

3836527286|5.0|The beautiful photograph book captures some iconic rock stars in intimate moments. Linda McCartney, wife of Paul McCartney and accomplish photographer takes you on a journey behind the veil of stardom and her family.<br />With texts from Annie Leibovitz, Paul McCartney, and the author to name a few, you are able to understand the composition of this work.  The British invasion changed the musical landscape of America, but what McCartney photographs do is capture the moments when the world was in a whirl.<br />I enjoyed the private moments of her daughter and the funny gestures that Paul made at the camera.  She notes in the opening passage \\"Shadows in light and shade seeing all things common or obscure I click.\\"<br />This colorful book of larger than life photographs should be an ideal part of any diverse personal library.
0525953728|5.0|I wish there were more people to write books like this.  Very informant about what the SEALS do for this<br />country.  It reminds me of the pride we had when I was growing up.  I would reccomend this to anyone that<br />like to read.
B002NJWHHA|2.0|If you have never read the book, then this is a pretty good movie. But, having read the book, I was sooo disappointed!! Nothing they did was hardly accurate. And they killed off the Ra'zac...and by doing that, there is no way that they could make a second movie if they wanted to because the Ra'zac are part of the second book! This was a waste of movie for me..

0316228532|1.0|Do you want to get depressed? Then read this book. It has it all: child abuse, child molestation, rape, prostitution, heroin, self-mutilation, cyber-bullying, domestic violence, ample swearing, etc. etc. etc. I guess Rowling was attempting to showcase her versatility by veering as far from the Harry Potter books as possible. This book is depressing from beginning to end. Don't waste your money.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I bought this book on a whim...I had certainly heard of Jaycee Dugard and the case and even remember when she was found.  I just decided to read her words.  As a mother of two girls I took to heart her story and cried...even small things like the little ring on her finger that she had.  As a mother I am sure I disappoint my kids when I forget or let them down (not kissing them in the morning as I rush off to work)  I could not stop crying.  Every moment is important and you need to stop and see what the priority is.  The horrific abuse that Jaycee edured and to become the person she is today is to be applauded...she and her family never gave up hope and she is a beautiful soul who should be admired by all.  I was definately changed by her words and life.  Thank you.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I enjoyed this \\"feel good, laugh out loud\\" movie.  It was light hearted and fun. Better than Valentine's Day. Fun to see all the different stars.
B0053O8AQE|1.0|I never write reviews, and it is a shame that my first one has to be negative, but I can't keep quiet..this show is awful. The writing is as lazy as it gets, extremely simple, and will always take the path of least resistance (hey, another Asian stereotype joke, sex innuendo, ect..). I watched most of the first season and tuned in to catch a little bit of the newer episodes..nothing has change.<br /><br />The overwhelming positive reviews on here baffle me, maybe that's what possessed me to provide my opinion. This is what passes as good TV? I don't understand how CBS continues to dominate the ratings. I would think that the quote \\"older generation viewers\\" they have would be turned off by a show like this.<br /><br />I think the thing that irks me the most is that actual good shows on that are on other networks struggle to get viewers and get cancelled or put on the chopping block every other week.<br /><br />In the brief time I did watch it, I could tell, there are scenes/stories where it would try to show heart, but again, it's simply too lazy.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|The fourth installment of the \\"Mission Impossible\\" series has got to be the best. The script was excellent, The speciaL effects were superb! This is a must see!
B005I4JG80|5.0|I read this book as an American mother raising a 4 year old in France.  I am so glad I did.  It explained so much to me about how and why French mothers act.  The book is really well written, insightful and entertaining.  My only complaint is that she doesn't go into more detail about the later years in the school system.  Things change dramatically and I would love to get her input.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|if you liked their first album you will not be let down by this one. i got the deluxe edition and im glad i did, the 3 extra songs are well worth it. not one of their songs have let me down yet. they have become one of my all time favs. so do your ears a favor and make them happy by getting this album. enjoy!!!

B0087YP862|5.0|There are in the market lots of recordings featuring Mozart's Piano Concertos K 595 & K 466. All the great pianists of the last century felt entitled themselves to approach these famous works for piano and orchestra and committed to disc their vision, their commentary, their improvisatory inspiration and sense of melody.  Far from being accessible works, the two concertos demand a high quality craftsmanship, not only a perfect technique.<br /><br />Maria Joao Pires is one of those special musicians who can convey a whole world by most austere means. In other words, maximum of effect with modicum of effort. The Portuguese pianist is ranked for decades among the most refined musicians of our age. Her repertory preferences go to Mozart, Schubert, Chopin and very few other composers. But how charming she knows make their work touch our souls and minds! How profound - and at the same time sensible, full of delicacy - her vision could be!<br /><br />Here she is paired in Mozart's gems by a super-class conductor - Claudio Abbado - and a seemingly predestined orchestra \\"Mozart\\" from Bologna, an ensemble raised up and strengthened by the Italian maestro during the last years.  As one who had the chance to listen to Maria Joao Pires performing live another Mozart famous concerto (K 488) - in Bucharest, during \\"George Enescu\\" Festival in September 2009 - I can testify that she actually \\"lives\\" the music she performs. There is no stridency in her touch, a stunning naturalness flows throughout the proceedings, the music itself takes the stage from the first note to the last. I am fond therefore to discover on her recent recording all those charming qualities that make a great moment of musical communion. All the great artists are striving to touch such moments of grace. Even the greatest artists reach such climaxes seldom and are not able to explain how they got there.<br /><br />This performance of Maria Joao Pires could be safely considered one of those rare moments of grace who singles out an interpretation and consecrate it as a landmark achievement.
B000001DVD|4.0|I know this album has prob sold over 2 million by now but I still reckon it hasn't been heard by enough rock fans. GnR Appetite's overall feel reminded me of this.<br />I must admit, the 1st thing I bought by DL was Hysteria. & it is still 1 of my favourite all time albums, since I was a schoolboy, over 20 years ago. You don't even need to be a hard rock fan to love that album. So Hysteria being so good I knew I had to delve into their past. Pryo obviously sold a lot more than HnD however song for song they are literally very hard to split. HnD definitely had potentional for hit singles like the title track 1 of my Def Lep favs \\"you got me runnin\\".<br /><br />Bottom Line. This is an album by probably the best hard rock band of the 80's. If you wanna argue with that, put it to the sales of the albums Pyromania & Hysteria. On Def Leps 1st 4 albums, this was their 2nd, they were great in combining melody (pop), hooks, riffs and sometimes reasonably complex instrumentation or arrangements.
0810993139|5.0|This series is WONDERFUL.  I bought the entire series since it's publication for my youngest child.  He loves these books to the point that he would sit down with one and I'd have to make him put it down to do something else.  Perfect for my 7 year old.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The fifth of five fantastic books by George R.R. Martin. I could not put it down and was very sad when it was finished. I love this saga and can't wait until the next one is available.
B001FB5634|4.0|I'm a fan of McCarthy's but I found the novel on which this film is based a little disappointing. For me, it was a tad too distant for it to fully work. And so this is one of those very rare occasions where, for me at least, the film surpasses the novel. It's bleak stuff for sure, and it won't be to everyone's taste, but as a study of humanity and parenthood under the most extreme conditions imaginable it's a powerful piece of cinema. There's no plot to speak of, but that doesn't matter. The film is about people not events: A father and son clinging onto each other and onto life, as they search for hope in a destroyed world. The performances are convincing as is the recreation of a post-apocalyptic world. It's difficult to describe such material as enjoyable, but it is certainly engrossing and thought-provoking.
B007TBCTRK|5.0|Like the film, this soundtrack is getting unfair hatred due to misguided expectations. If you're a fan of Goldsmiths original score this should not disappoint you. It's at times ethereal, mysterious, grand, and scary. It's a great companion piece to the Alien soundtrack. It has enough of it's own DNA to set itself apart while also feeling like it belongs the Alien mythos.
B005J4TLN4|3.0|I've always enjoyed the humour of Joe Cornish and Adam Buxton, and so looked forward to watching this movie. To say I was disappointed would be an exaggeration but I wasn't bowled over either. The film isn't especially funny, and it certainly isn't scary, but it is charming and heart-warming (in a grisly sort of way). Cornish's love of Hollywood creature movies is evident and transposes nicely to the decidedly un-glamourous setting of a south London tower block. The largely unknown cast perform well and are utterly convincing (the patois is the funniest aspect of the film) and the low-budget effects mesh with the overall tone of the piece. It's fun but I can't help thinking it's an unfulfilled work. I'm sure Cornish will do better. 3.5/5.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|My grandma showed me this movie because my mom watched this as a little kid. Awesome, I watched it three more times.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|My Dad and I have read all of the Reacher books and almost didn't buy this one after the last book was a let down. Put that with the negative reviews for this book and I thought the author may have lost his edge, so we would wait until the price dropped to under $10. I bought the book for my Dad anyway, then read it myself on a trip and it was a huge surprise. It was in no way boring and I enjoyed it more than most of the other books I have read lately! Reacher shouldn't have to be constantly pummeling someone for the book to have tension and this book in no way was a disappointment.
B008133DO8|5.0|This is the premier of another brilliant season of \\"Sherlock.\\"  First, I'm biased because I love the British.  Very civil.  This is also the country from where the best detectives arise; or genre writers.  The mystery is my favorite.  Beautiful script and production.  The producers go to length to make it look original.  I know it will not take a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that I've been . . .

B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters in this fascinating look at WWI British life are so real yo want to look them up in Wikipedia or somewhere to read more about them. The acting is British Best. Buying this set is like coming home with a dozen fresh donuts and trying not to eat them all in one night.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Loved this game and got pretty far into it and then it stop ped opening. The opening screen will come on and then it crashes.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Without Stephen King and It, I would never have written [[ASIN:B0098LA1Q0 Dead Religion]]. I've read this book twice and listened to it once. There is virtually no other horror book that can compare to this.<br /><br />Briefly, the story takes place in two different times, with a group of friends trying stop an ancient monster who masquerades as a clown.<br /><br />That's like trying to describe the ocean to someone by saying it's wet. The book is, at its heart, a love story between a group of friends. King weaves this tail through two different eras, showing how children eventually grow up and become something that perhaps a part of them wishes they weren't. He shows what courage looks like when actual mortals, and not the heroes we normally encounter in books and movies, have to face terror. Some can't handle it and shy away, while others rise even though horror of what they must do possesses them completely.<br /><br />The worst part about this book is it's length. Perhaps King could have cut two hundreds pages from it. Other than though, this is a must read book, not only for horror fans but because of its standing in American culture.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|These movies are golden and should be in anyone's collection that wants the movies and hasn't gotten them yet or that just likes superhero movies in general. All of the movies are at least pretty good but the highlights are Spider-Man 3 and then 2. In that way from the original Spider-Man on, the movies just got better and better. The stories touch on plenty of action, romance and contain good character development. In this specific package Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 come with 2 DVDs each one being for the main movie and the other most likely extras (I don't examine the extra DVDs much). All 3 movies are in Widescreen format. This set is worth it for Spider-Man 2 and 3 alone. Get this.<br /><br />5 stars.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|Disconcerting narrative that challenges the reader. Protagonist can time travel and has to make decisions about changing events in the past. Of course this involves having to second guess the ramifications in the future. Interesting take on the butterfly effect.
0385340990|5.0|I loved this book, despite what I thought was a stupid title.<br /><br />It's written simply (but not in a way that makes you feel like you're losing brain cells).<br /><br />The story is told via correspondences between a woman and her friends (both old and new).  She is a writer looking for something to write about and finds herself introduced to a man with a story that intrigues her.  Through their letters she learns of a secret/illegal book club that held meetings during WWII in Guernsey.  Intrigued, she begins writing to some of the people from the bookclub, some of them quite eccentric.  Over time she falls in love with not only the people but the place she's heard so much about.  Through the letters, there is a slow buildup of love that the reader themself (or me anyway) feels for all the characters.  As Juliet begins to feel like they are family, so does the reader.<br /><br />It's interesting because of how quirky and authentic the letters feel, instead of long drawn-out stories like some letter-stories can create.  It works because the reader is given just enough to leave them wanting more from the letters.  You want to know what happens between the letters, but part of you likes that you don't/won't know.
B009A3NGF4|3.0|Sounds basically the same as their last album. It's great, though. If you like Mumford and sons sound you'll enjoy this album.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|I don't like reviewing music, because I think everyone's taste is different, so I don't really see the point.<br /><br />But... I love this album.  So much.  The individual songs are great and the album as a whole works well.  The sound is different than what you'll find on the radio but the songs are both upbeat and sad at the same time.  Earnest.<br /><br />This album is refreshingly good.  I don't often like entire albums, but this one is in my list of top bands/albums.  One of the best to come out in recent years, in my opinion.<br /><br />(Sidenote: I've seen them live and the band is excellent.)
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Great AMZ.COM purchase. Heavy hacker, seems indestructible. Fairly sharp, will need some honing to slice paper. The sheath is way too tight, I finally removed one rivet to loosen it up, now is easy to draw.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|As a avid fan of Follett, I could hardly wait for this book to become available.  I was a fan of his when his genre was spy/mystery novels but his venture into new worlds with his trilogies, the first being Pillars of the Earth and Now his Century Trilogy has captivated a new audience.  His ability to encompass such a global scale of characters and countries during the second world war era is enthralling.  For any reader looking for a story that spans a decade and world wide involvement, it is a story that will have you laughing, crying, and feeling the pain and joy of those participants.  His book are quite long, but even at close to 1000 pages, you'll be both pleased and sad that you finished it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie and really liked it.  One of my friends said she didn't enjoy it because she had read the books and they were so much better.  I bought the Kindle Trilogy and am really enjoying it.  Glad I saw the movie first so now I can still enjoy the greater detail/plot of the stories.  So easy to read on my Kindle.  Always pleased with my Amazon purchases!

B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this one not too long ago. I didn't love it. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever read either.  None of the characters have any redeeming value or likeability

1449410243|5.0|I pre-ordered 3 of these books about 1 week before it was released. Matthew Inman is a pure genius when it comes to writing comics and telling it like it is. He is not afraid to speak his mind. I love how politically incorrect he is.<br /><br />I got 2 extras so I can provide offensive gifts to friends... (Am I a good friend or what??)<br /><br />We seem to live in a world that whipped and everyone seems to get offended at one thing or another. This book is filled with wonderful offensive material that will be sure to ruffle the feathers of the sensitive types out there. So if you are weak minded and get offended by comics that talk about cat poop, animals that lick their testicles, gay cats, and howitzers... this book is not for you.<br /><br />Better yet when I pre-ordered the books they were $8.98 each, but the price went down 18 cents so I was refunded 54 cents, how awesome is that?<br /><br />The pull out poster is hanging in my kitties room above their litter box, so they can study it for future attack methods.

I wish he would explain why he commuted the prison sentence for a political ally's son (who pleaded guilty in the stabbing death of a college student) shortly before his term as California governor ended.  Maybe he did explain.  Never got that far in the book before returning it to the person who lent it to me.  What a scumbag.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book helped me to understand why the people of North Korea have allowed their dictators to remain in power.<br />By literally starving their people, preventing them from hearing the truth, claiming to be gods or benevolent fathers - even as they murdered their critics -  they/fear controlled the hearts and minds of their citizens.  Silencing the people who knew and told the truth about life before the Korean War, they were able to indoctrinate and brainwash the rest.  Hopefully, Kim Jong Un, the young successor to Kim Jong Il will use his education and exposure to prosperity throughout the region, to stop the starvation, illiteracy, and hopelessness of his people.  He'd better, because the numbers of defectors are growing and they are getting news and truth and food into this failed Communist country.<br />The book also validated my fears of news that is controlled by a single source, be it the government or Murdock...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I loved this book! For those of you who haven't read it, what are you waiting for? This book was everything I hoped for and more! There were lots of laugh out loud moments. Annabeth- \\"Don't worry, I only attack my boyfriend like that.\\" I love how Riordan is able to mix humor and wit to make one heck of a story. His characters are well done, although I personally do not like Piper. She says she isn't like her siblings at Camp Half-Blood yet all she cares about is her relationship with Jason. Oh! And when she said that Percy looked unimpressive next to Jason, I was so mad! Percy is 1,000 time better than Jason and everyone knows it! And the ending! I would have cried if I wasn't in the middle of Biology reading under my desk. :)Anyway, if you love action, humor, suspense, and a hint of romance, I would definitely recommended this book to you. My only regret, I have to wait one whole year for the next book! Sigh. Happy Reading!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading Bared to You, the first book in the Crossfire series, it was no-brainer that I would pick this one up too. I love that this one picked up right where book 1 left off. I would have hated to miss a moment of Mr. -Make Me Have To Change My Panties At Least 2 Times Just From The Sound of His Name- Cross. Yea. He's just that good. Complete Swoon Status. Actually, I think we need a new word - because when it comes to him - \\"swoon\\" just seems a little too innocent.. Let's go with.. Sex on a Stick.. or Hot Sex Walking.. You pick (:<br /><br />Eva & Gideon have a relationship that is completely one of a kind. A relationship only the two of them could ever really understand. Without each other they are lost & with each other they are sometimes more of a mess than if they were alone. Then again, love does some strange things to you.<br /><br />Both are so deeply scared from their past that neither of them really knows how to move forward. Which in turn leads to the insane amount of trust and commitment issues between the two of them. On one hand you have Eva - an open book who wants nothing more than to give herself to Gideon & just about wears her heart on her sleeves. On the other hand you have Gideon - who loves Eva beyond belief, but his book is closed and pretty much has a padlock on it. Though he continues to tell Eva to \\"Just Trust Him\\" - that can only get him so far before she just loses it and decides to take matters into her own hands. Which, she does - in the form of an Ex. Then again; we all know Gideon has his own Ex issues; so score a point for Eva.<br /><br />This book def took me on a never ending emotional.. hurricane. (I felt roller coaster was too nice of a word) Gideon is such an Alpha Male that you can't help but to be drawn to him. On the other hand, he is also (in his own way) a lover of EXTREME proportions. His love for Eva knows no bounds and even though he might not always be good with words, where Gideon is concerned, actions speak louder than words. HOT; SWEATY - THROW YOU UP AGAINST EVERY SURFACE OF THE HOUSE AND COMPLETELY SCREW YOU SENSELESS - type of actions. && let me tell you Sylvia Day knows JUST how to bring that side of Gideon to life.<br /><br />The back and forth between the two sometimes seemed never ending. I just wanted to smack them both on the head and be like \\"GET IT TOGETHER ALREADY!\\" Then again, with the way Day wrote the story, I completely saw where it was headed. After all, life has a way of telling you things have to get worse before they get better. Case & Point: Evan & Gideon. Another thing I completely loved about this book was Cary. I honestly don't think these books would be the same without him. As Eva's best friend - he is around quite a bit && he is freaking HILARIOUS.<br /><br />Yup. Dude is classic. If you haven't read Bared to You yet - you should! & then you need to pick up Reflected in You - because it's just so epically awesome, that you HAVE to read it! &lt;3er than words.

B0050R0XPA|5.0|Not sure it's worth the $69.99 MSRP - but I got it on sale here at Amazon so my rating is based on the cheaper price.  The set is divided into numbered bags and has a very easy to follow manual.  It took about two hours to put it together and I enjoyed every minute of it.  I wouldn't recommend this set for children under 13 - this is a more complicated build with lots of small pieces.<br /><br />It's a must have if you are collecting sets of the holiday buildings.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day blows away the filth of political pandering and maneuvering that has pervaded the public story of Osama Bin Laden's death by simply telling it like it was.  It does far more than that, however.  Perhaps because I am a high school teacher and spend hours every day with young- and all too frequently demoralized, ambition-less teen boys, this book impacted me hugely.  It is the story of remarkable American men who have decided to live for something bigger than themselves.  I took this book to class one day and put it on my desk.  Sure enough, within minutes every boy in my class was drooling over the cover...but its the story inside that I want them to get in their heads.  The story inside tells of men who set high individual goals and strive to achieve them.  It tells of men who take personal responsibility for failure, even while they refuse to consider failure an option.  No Easy Day is the story of men who have consciously decided to make great personal sacrifice for the good of others.  The world could use more men like this, and the boys I spend my days with need to hear the personal stories of men like Mark Owen to inspire them to become such men.  I extend my deep appreciation to all the men and women of the armed forces, and to the writer.  I've got boys lined up to borrow this book from me, and I'm glad for it.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|I have been a fan since the 70's and nothing they have done beyoynd the 80's touches the early stuff.  Enough said.  They seem they have been looking for their identity for years and just when it seemed they may have found it in Revenge and Carnival then came the reunion and the band cohesiveness was lost again.  I really don't know what you would expect from a band whose main songwriters are in their 60's.  I think it's better than mediocre but as many have said there are no classics here.  I do find myself liking it more with each listen which is a pleasant surprise. Lyrically it's pretty 'not good' but if you are looking to KISS for lyrical content you are looking in the wrong place.  Is it just me or are Gene's lyrics just exceptionally bad?  I see NO effort from him lyrically.  On a positive note it rocks harder (read another review about the drums standing out - I agree) than the last two releases which I like and also like the fact they let Tommy contribute and left out the attempts at ballad type hits.  That time has long since past. I would love to see them go dark and heavy for an album with the help of an A list producer.  I think it would breathe life into them.  It's never too late!

B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This book started off great! I flew through the first 6-7 chapters in a matter of hours. I thought it was so adorable, sexy and funny. But then Abby's and Travis's relationship grew to be so melodramatic and dysfunctional I had a hard time believing the story line. Maybe this is a book for younger readers; 25 years old MAX. Maybe the younger readers can relate better to the extreme drama of the main characters. To me the relationship was completely unhealthy.<br />Travis went from being a cool, confident, some-what womanizing person to a complete softy/psycho, to include random acts of violence due to the fact that he's so screwed up and jealous and possessive. Honestly he should have been arrested for assault charges AT LEAST 6 times in the book.<br />Overall it wasn't too bad, but near the end I was just trying to get it over with. There is a surprising and dramatic event that happens near the end of the book and the event was very gripping. However afterwards the characters didn't seem to be affected too much, which doesn't make sense because if that was real life they would need some kind of therapy.<br />Read it if you like, just don't expect a normal relationship with the main characters.
B008RTE066|3.0|I've seen this probably a hundred times and so have all my Beatle friends over the years.  It was a midnight movie favorite back in the 70's and 80's and then when it came out on videotape.  It's not that great, but it has its moments, in particular 'I Am the Walrus' and 'Your Mother Should Know.'  I guess what's best about it is seeing the Beatles at a time when they weren't otherwise seen as much as in the early days.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I found this book to be interesting - it kept my attention from beginning to end.  It was very eye opening to the life these men live, without giving away trade secrets that put them in danger.  I had heard most all of this story in bits and peieces from the media - but I appreciate the time put into telling the story from beginning to end.  The added bonus is the $$ being donated to the military from the sale of the book - made this book a great choice.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|This album has a new twist. The guys added some Linkin park electronic sound effect to the album. Only on a few songs such as \\"still swingin\\" \\"As far as i remember\\" \\"wont let up\\" and about 2 others. But it is a good change. It adds to the album and gives it more tangibility. Overall the best Papa roach album i have ever purchased. It has songs about real situations in life and a great vibe. The soft and hard songs are spaced out well and the vocals are amazing. Well worth the buy

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This isn't a review of the show but a complaint with Amazon. I gave it 5 stars because the show deserves it and I don't want to lower its rating with my Amazon complaint.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the show and loved season 2. I just bought it last Friday so I could watch it again before season 3 starts up. I normally don't have problems with Amazon but they let me down this time. I was up to episode 5 on disc 2 when it froze up and skipped to the next episode. I tried a few times to get it to play but it kept freezing. When I looked at the back of the disc, it had a rather large circular scratch. I looked at the other discs and number 3 had this same scratch. This was brand new so it was a factory defect, not Amazon's fault. The problem I have is that Amazon will not replace it. Sure, they will send me a refund which is nice and all, but I wanted a replacement. They told me that since it came from a 3rd party seller, the best I could do was get my money back. Well, when I made the purchase, it clearly said sold and shipped by Amazon. There was no mention of a third party. My problem with all this is that I bought it for a lower price than  what is now listed. So, if I want to get another copy, I have to pay the current price. Sure, this show is worth what it is selling for but it's still not right to make me send mine back, get a refund and then buy at a higher price. Amazon has been good to me in the past but this recent incident leaves me a bit jaded.<br /><br />All that being said, I can't wait till Sunday an the start of season 3. Best show on TV.
030758836X|3.0|This book is only 2.5 stars for me.<br /><br />It sure took me a long time and much determination to finish this book. This book is good with the unexpected twist in the personalities of the characters but the story is just too slow at times and it is so hard to keep up with the content.<br /><br />I didn't like the ending much. It just didn't gave justice to the whole story. Both Nick & Amy are so unlikable.<br /><br />The first part of the book is all about Amy having gone missing and the entries she had wrote in her diary leading up the event that caused Nick to became the only suspect in her 'murder' case. It is really slow in this first part of the book as it made up almost 50% of the story. This caused many others to drop this book not knowing that there is a great twist in the beginning of Part 2.<br /><br />The second part of the book began with a BANG! Amy confessing that all those diary entries are fake. She had known about Nick's affair and wanted her revenge by either killing herself and frame Nick on it. But she was too much of a coward to do so. She actually used a year of careful planning to create the perfect 'murder' for her husband.<br /><br />The last part of this book is when she came home to Nick after murdering Desi, a guy who had been mad over her for years and was more than pleased to help her out during her escape. However when she got tricked over Nick's sweet words over the internet videos to lure her back and she realized that she couldn't control Desi any longer, she made the whole story of him kidnapping her and raping her and finally she killing him in defense.<br /><br />What I couldn't understand is that Amy is practically crazy and yet nobody is sending her to some mental institution. She murdered someone to make up a lie for herself to come back and no justice was done to her. Throughout her life she had been lying and acting like a psychopath and no one managed to pin her down? This is just so unbelievable.<br /><br />And Nick, knowing that she is crazy and all her sins, yet he could bring himself to forgive her? Just because she is carrying his baby not made out of love? (She used his semen externally!) Why would he want that crazy bitch as a mother of his child?<br /><br />I did enjoyed the twist in the book but I can't say I loved the story because both characters disgust me. I am not sure if I would want to recommend this book to my friends.owing that she is crazy and all her sins, yet he could bring himself to forgive her?

0316228532|5.0|I must confess that when I was reading the book, I wanted to write a review that would bury it. Like many others, I felt that the adult characters in the book were intolerably mean, cruel, and selfish. However, now that I have finished the book, I am propelled to praise it. Simply put, I miss it. Unbelievably, I want to be in Pagford again, with its unsavory characters and heart-breaking victims. Why? Because the book is vivid and powerful, and its ending packs a punch.<br />But there is more. Each portrayal of the nasty adult characters is limned with his of her anguish; they are cruel or stupid, but they are also suffering. Thus they become more complex characters that many reviewers thought them to be. Of course, some of them do not earn any of our sympathies, but many do, in their disappointments and loneliness. The view of Pagford is dismal, but it is bound to arouse not only our indignation, but also our compassionate reflection.<br />So many reviews have already been written on this book that I knew I'd have to present a new insight, or point of view. So I went back to the 18th-century French philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who put forth the belief in childhood innocence, threatened by corrupt adult society. Rousseau's views influenced 19th century writers--Dickens, Mark Twain, Lewis Carroll, and many others. Even Dostoevsky often entertained the Rousseaistic belief in childhood innocence, but he was more ambivalent about it. Before I go back to Dostoevsky, here's the Rousseaistic quandary: if only children are innocent, and the  adults are unworthy, what do we do? We must grow up! Must we inevitably fall into the corrupt net the grown-ups before us have set for us? Is there no other direction--for growth and redemption--for the adults? That's the question that Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, in its entirety, poses for us. And the ultimate answer is no, the adults are also capable of growth.<br />In the chapter \\"Rebellion,\\" preceding his famous fable, \\"The Grand Inquisitor,\\" Ivan asserts that only children are innocent. Children can be loved, he says, \\"even when they are ugly (I fancy, though, children are never ugly).\\" Adults, on the other hand, are \\"disgusting\\" and \\"unworthy of love.\\" He further says, \\"the devil take them all.\\"<br />And yet, Dostoyevsky himself doesn't agree. Dmitri Karamazov, Ivan's brother, swears up and down that he is going to kill his father. As he says to his brother Alyosha: \\"I can stop it or carry it through...Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through...I shall carry out my base plan...Darkness and destruction!\\" But Dmitri doesn't carry it through! He does not kill his father! He triumphs over his most destructive impulses and is even ready to renounce Grushenka to her rightful fiance,  a Polish guy who had all but disappeared from the scene. So Dmitri gets his punishment for wishing to kill his father, and he also gets his lover, Grushenka, now a fitting mate (rather than an object of obsessive lust). Dmitri has grown and earned his moral freedom.<br />My only problem with The Casual Vacancy is that I couldn't find adults to identify with. Unike Rousseau, Rowling doesn't present the young characters as innocent, but, like Rousseau, she puts her faith in them; they are the only ones capable of growth, heroism, and even a measure of contrition and nobility. Where are the grown-ups who are capable of growth and introspection? They are nowhere to be found!<br />If Rowling wants to go back to Pagford, I have a suggestion for her: create adult characters who are capable of growth and change, who have consciences, and who are not so selfish and distracted.  Perhaps adults who are in love, or who love their children, because those adults do exist (for example, you do). Now that you have taken out all the anger on the adults, perhaps it is time to find their redemptive possibilities.
0062060562|5.0|I first saw this book at my local bookstore and I was captivated by the description at the back of the book. However I went online to did a research on the review of this book on Amazon and I found lots of negative reviews, hence I dropped the idea of ever picking this book up.<br /><br />However, I joined a book club and this book was one of the read recommended for August and Goodreads do have quite a number of positive review on it. Hence I decided to give it a try. Gosh, I am so glad I gave this book another chance.<br /><br />Once I started reading it, I was drew into Christine's life. I could feel her anxiety, her loss of not knowing who she is and what had happened to her.<br /><br />One third though the book, I had already guessed that Ben was not the man whom she had married because of her memory recap where he had to leave her house after they had sex. Why would her own husband need to leave the house at such late hours?<br /><br />I knew that he must be the one who had hurt her (as most story would have been which many hints dropped throughout the book) and caused her accident but never did I thought that is was NOT a car accident that had her ended up this way.<br /><br />I was convinced that her son was dead so the twist at the end where it was revealed that he was alive and well came as a surprise to me.<br /><br />What had me confused was that why did nobody at the Wharfing House knew that the man (Mike) who picked her up was not the real Ben? If Ben had been visiting her daily before he left, they should know his real look.<br /><br />Overall I am still happy with the ending of the book where she returned to her family and love ones. The burning of her journal that led her to the truth is actually meaningful as she could forget all about the bad memories between she and Mike and start a new journal where she could recorded all the great memories with her real husband, Ben, and her son. Although it was not mentioned if she could made new memories in future, I hope that she could and her condition would get better.<br />The book really had been me holding on and reading non-stop except for when I had to go to work, lesson and sleep. I even ate my meals with it. That's how mesmerized I was with ituture, I hope that she could and her condition would get better.<br />The book really had been me holding on and reading non-stop except for when I had to go to work, lesson and sleep.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|So I normally don't enjoy movies based on books that I've read, but this movie is definitely an exception.  I've read the entire Hunger Games series, more than once (Yes, I'm a total dork) and loved them, so I had to at least check out the movie.<br /><br />If I hadn't read the books, I'm actually not sure I would have enjoyed the movie as well as I did.  There was a lot of internal dialogue in the book that was left up to the imagination in the movie, which is par for the course when translating a book to film.  Also, having read the books, I was already emotionally invested in the characters.  The movie didn't really make me more invested, but seemed to rely on the assumption that I already was.  That's actually why I only gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5...because it seemed like the filmmakers were working on the assumption that viewers had read the books.<br /><br />That said, even if you haven't read the books, this movie is still worth watching.  The acting was pretty good, the cast was awesome (seriously, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna?! Love!)and it's a moving story.  Definitely worth checking out.  Oh, and read the books.  Seriously :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|In all honesty, I haven't read it---yet.  I started but then quickly realized I had forgotten a lot of the details from the first book.  So I decided to re-read \\"Fall of Giants\\" before reading \\"Winter of the World\\".  It almost feels decadent to be indulging myself in this way.  The best time I spend is with any book by Ken Follett and these two (and the third) do not disappoint.  It's like visiting a favorite vacation spot over and over again.  It's always beautiful, uplifting and provocative.  Thank you, Mr. Follett, for continuing to pump out these fantastic stories.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I love it! They are always so different from everyone else, I love this cd!! Theynwver disappoint me! Great cd!
1451627297|2.0|I watched the enhanced e-version video and was completely disappointed to hear Stephen King weave a narrative straight from the debunked Warren Commission. Does the author not know that even the Congressional Select Committee on Assassinations determined in the 1970s that the Kennedy Assassination was the result of a CONSPIRACY? And that Lee Harvey Oswald did NOT act alone? Could NOT have acted alone? Even though King is a novelist, a fiction writer, he should have based his story on REAL HISTORICAL FACTS. The absolute indisputable truth is that Lee Harvey did not act alone. Period. Shame on Stephen King. And I am a fan.
B008OJ291W|1.0|Ok after what it seems like dozens of compilations why would a artist want to redo his songs?? the originals are always the best.Jeff you have enough<br />money leave your legacy alone for crying out loud!
B0087ZG7NO|5.0|I've always enjoyed the jurassic park movies. I say they are one of the best movies Steven has ever done. I Think the lost world personally is the best cause it all in the jungle most of the time it's dark and rainy. Don't forget that now they have 2 T-rex in this movie and they are ten times bigger then the first one in Jurassic Park. I will agree that it was kinda weird that they had to have a T-rex go through a city like it was Godzilla the (1998 Film). If You ask Me the 3rd one was not as good as the first 2. it's not the same without the T-rex but, the Spino. wasn't that bad of an idea. The T-rex will always be the best. I really hope that the 4th one brings it back. Jurassic Park is not as good with out it.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I love KISS. Always have. This album has spark. More musically than vocally. Gene's bass playing is better than ever. Drums, guitar riffs, solos, all of those are really good. The album is pretty decent and there's not one song that I would skip. They are not great songs but they are ALL good songs. I have found myself in some albums to skip songs because some I can't stand. I prefer an album like this one. You can listen to any song and enjoy it. I really like \\"All for the love of Rock and Roll\\", \\"Outta this World\\", \\"Eat your heart out\\" and \\"Long way down\\". Though I like more the verse than the chorus of the latter. It's a solid album.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|I haven't read the book...but I am guessing it was good, and I bet the author was pissed when he/she saw the movie. Great actors, great idea for a story, and yet it was RUINED by the worst directing imaginable!!! This director pushed foreshadowing to a laughable extreme, and I as a viewer am frankly insulted. SERIOUSLY, how many times are you going to show your audience Tilda washing red paint off her skin!!!!! Of all the ways you could have opened the film, and you choose Tilda in a sea of TOMATOES!!! Well, if you're going to hit your audience over the head with that kind of heavy handed symbolism...I think this was supposed to represent... um... blood...than for the love of christ is it really necessary to continue the whole red thing after that??? We get it, she is partly responsible and therefore has blood on her hands. So given that obvious fact from the opening scene is it really necessary to SHOW HER WASHING, SCRUBBING, WIPING, ETC... red substances (including hamster blood) off her hands throughout the entire film!?! We get it already!!! And the red stuffed animals, the red outfits, the red lights every five seconds...AND my god how many Christmas scenes can one movie have...this felt like the polar express. AND I loved the music, but it made no sense within the context of the scenes in which it was placed. I'm sure the director thought \\"oh let's put some folk music in here, cause isn't it a brilliant idea to work against the mood of the scene?\\"...well that could have worked once...maybe even three times, but after that you are simply showing your hand. Seriously!!! I can't believe I watched the entire movie...Grrrrr....
B008PE9GSA|1.0|I was hoping for something much better, I'll go back to Mescalero, a far superior CD for the more recent ZZ Top stuff.

0316228532|2.0|Before I started reading the novel, I scanned reviews and was amazed at the number of one star reviews. After finishing the novel, I think, I know why  there are so many. I think, people expected JKR to come up with something as original as Harry Potter series.  Alas, Harry Potter happens only once, and we all are thankful that it did happen :-))<br /><br />This novel is gloomy to the point of being depressing. As much as I tried I did not see any trace of \\"dry British humor\\", as one review mentioned. Well, try to write about modern high school, and I don't think anything cheerful can come out of it. Little town with big ambitions, some openly dysfunctional families with substance abuse or physical abuse; some middle class families, which on the facade seem successful and loving, in reality - every family is unhappy in their own way (c) and there are a couple of skeletons in every closet. Three generations - grandparents, parents and teenagers. Lost communication between teenagers and parents. Domination of grandparents. Sandwich generation parents are drifting away from each other.<br /><br />Where is the line that you draw in helping others? What about your own family, how much time and efforts go into the closest people to you? Can you do more for your kids before you go and fight for less fortunate ones? And as much as you empathize with less fortunate kids and understand that this is not their fault they behave the way they do - are you ready and wiling to have them in your daughters' class?<br /><br />The first one hundred pages I found a bit slow, but as you make mental connections and start following all the characters, it is very addicting. In my opinion it can be less graphic in some parts and have less references to body part, sex, etc. - but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />Overall - good writing, real characters, makes you think about your values as a parent and about your family.<br /><br />Update - about two months after I read the book. I decided to change the review, after my friend asked me if I recommend the book for her to read. And my first impulse was - No, I do not. I did not like any of the characters and there are many more novels written about \\"little town\\" ambitions, intrigues and values. Nothing original.
0385333846|5.0|No many words are needed to describe how much I enjoyed this book. Vonnegut's writing style is literary genius and the reoccurring themes, examples of human nature and deja vu will leave you lost for words in a bliss of awe. I only wished that there was such a thing as a 6 star rating. So it goes.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I love all the Ken Follet books I have read.  My only reservation about Fall of Giants is the lengthy descriptions of the lead into war can be a bit long.  I had to resist the temtation to gloss over those passages.  All in all its another good read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett at his best. History of WWII in the eyes of people who were living in Germany, England, Russia and United States of America during 1933-1945.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Story line conception holds great potential for sequels. As many other reviewers have said, the story and the scale are epic. This is beautifully shot and rendered. The 7.1 audio is very well done.  Unfortunately, the character development falls short and the plot line is handled with unconvincing choppiness. Much of the story and plot feels forced rather than letting it unfold. Many of the reveals are obvious and lacking suspense  while others never come.<br /><br />I suspect that there was a great deal of content left on the editing floor in order to get the final release out the door. If true, maybe a future director's cut would allow for much needed continuity and fill in some of the glaring holes in the plot. That would be quite welcome and allow this film to go from pretty good to great.<br /><br />Overall, it is definitely worth seeing and owning, given the extremely high production quality and strong sci-fi concept. But it is a shame the actual characters (with the exception of the two key characters) feel like placeholders. The storyline does very little to engender much empathy or engagement of most of the crew.<br /><br />Visuals aside, the most redeeming aspect to this movie is the thought provocation it evokes. High marks for exercising gray matter. While clearly more in the open question camp than clever answer, it does foster one to consider some very interesting concepts.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Preferred the first two but it was a great trilogy. Waiting for more reads from the great E. L. James.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I've seen the Bella Lugosi, Dracula probably 60 times, ( at least, so as not to exaggerate). These old scary movies were marvelous. I have even transcribed some of the script dialog to paper from the movie. This movie may be the reason why people are afraid of spiders and bats. Imagine, scaring the film audience with a rubber bat that you can see the strings.<br /><br />The book is fantastic. You'll want to read it more than once. If you like the Dracula movies it would be a shame not to read the book.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|As with the first 2 books by the same author, can't put it down & made me want to go to Sweden to check out the locations named!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|What a great story with a lesson to learn that is even more improtant today then when Dr. Seuss first wrote the Lorax.  This movie is enough to keep the kids attention with its' colorful characters, but the story will hold the attention of the adults. I would recommend this a great family night movie sure to join the classics.
B00866JL96|5.0|This was an awesome movie. I read the book first and then watched it. The movie didn't really follow the book, but it was still a great movie. Zac looked all grown up (so different from Troy who he played in High School Musical movies). Taylor was great. I only know her from the TV show Mercy. I loved her in this movie. The producers couldn't have picked a better cast to play all the parts.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Will sharpen a dull blade, but don't expect a razors edge. This is a great field knife sharpener, it has a carbide and ceramic stone sharpener and a small flip out serration sharpener. This is a handy little device and no doubt does it do what it is designed to do.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is really good. I mean, really good.I just cant stop playing it. Its a great game, I mean it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love the entire series. It was well thought out, insightful, and the characters were all very well explored. It's hard to believe this is a first time author.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|If you order from Amazon Instant Video you can download it to your computer and watch it now, you dont have to wait until the 23rd<br /><br />Dont get me wrong, its nice seeing Tatum Channing's chest and behind, and Im glad the movie has a story behind it, but it is NOT near as good as the previews make it out to be.  Rent it before you buy it.  Or you may end up severely disappointment and out of $15 just like me.
B008OJ291W|2.0|I love ELO, I love Jeff Lynne music.  I have everything in multiple versions from The Idle Race and The Move to all of Jeff's solo material including \\"All This And World War II\\" soundtrack LP/CD and the vinyl disco tune \\"Doin' That Crazy Thing.\\"  Love it all.<br /><br />While this is a crisp updating of the hits, they are very sterile sounding and what's missing tremendously is the bottom end muscle of the originals.  The drums are flat and back in the mix with no over all punch.  The dynamics are sorely missing....it's great songs without the excitement.  Jeff's voice is in super form.  The one ending new cut \\"Point of No Return\\" is great.  At least it's fresh without the old dynamos to compare against.<br /><br />Someone else here mentioned that this could be to retain rights/royalties to the tunes....but, I don't think that's it. If he owns the publishing, he would still get the royalties.  Hearing the old bandmates on his songs may bring up bad memories for him too. My thoughts are to maintain the registered trademark of ELO every so many years, he probably has to provide \\"usage\\" proof.  I do this with a registration mark I own.  Or/and it could have been part of the deal with the label.  He could release his solo piece, but doing a \\"Greatest Hits\\" would almost guarantee higher revenue for the label.  This is only guesswork and I don't claim to be an insider or know-it-all.  Just presenting possibilities.<br /><br />At any rate, if you just want super clean sounding versions of these great songs, but missing a bit of the exuberance of the originals, this can be for you.  If you're a staunch fan, like me, the new cut makes it worth while.<br /><br />One thing it does do for sure, is make you want more original material.  While he still has a strong voice and incredible musicianship...I'd love to hear at least one more original album.<br /><br />If you don't have it, and these hits reminded you of ELO, try something you may have missed - I do recommend \\"Zoom,\\" Jeff Lynne's last ELO Project highly.
B002SAUCBC|2.0|This was one of the saddest books that I have read in a long time.  Young boys are selected to walk, and walk and walk.  They cannot stop for anything.  I did not enjoy this book at all.
B0000844M8|5.0|Great true story that I can view many times with the same response! I enjoy it each time I see it!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book is the kind I could not put down. Silly as it might sound, I own it hardcover, but the book is so big it became a problem to read in bed. (I told you it might sound silly) so I purchased it for my kindle. If you want a \\"read\\" that grabs you from the very first page, this is it. I loved it and now that the second book is out, I ordered that one for my kindle as well.<br />Thank you whoever created the kindle and thank you Amazon for both all the books I can read and the device to read it on!<br />Lois A

B0098VXE50|5.0|Intriguing rendition and the acting was well done.  The graphics were pretty cool and showed slick imagination from the Enchanted Forest to the Queens Mirror.  Ms. Charlize Theron was very convincing and dove into her character, which showed us both Evil and Betrayal.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am such a big fan of the Mahjong games and this is another game I enjoy. For each timed game I do my best to complete faster and it's a awesome challenge for myself. I wish the tiles could be a bit larger but overall anyone would love this game.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|\\"The Martian' is a story about the struggle for survival of a single individual inadvertently stranded on Mars by his crew. It is literally the classic Robinson Crusoe story cast in the near future with current space technology. It is hard science fiction at its best and an exciting adventure tale as well. I am a great fan of Arthur Clarke and of classic space opera and have seen very little writing lately to match the quality of his books. This story is completely on par with Clarke's \\"Fall of Moondust\\" with the addition that Weir's character must rescue himself, rather than be rescued. The main character comes across as a real and believable person who displays considerable courage and determination throughout his ordeal.<br /><br />Having said that, there is a reason that I gave this story a 4 instead of a 5: Excessive use of profanity - especially f-bombs - throughout the story, sometimes multiple times on one page. I am not normally bothered by profanity and to some degree it is plausible considering the trials and tribulations of the main character. In this case, however, it seems to be grossly overused to add zest to a story that did not need it.<br /><br />I hope that the author writes more great stories like this one, but with toned-down profanity.
0425220931|2.0|Let me start off by saying Victor Wooten is an amazing bassist and if I even achieve a fraction of his mastery I'll die feeling accomplished.  That said, I'd also gathered from watching some of his interviews that he was, well, a little flaky, and I knew going into this book that it wouldn't be a traditional technique guide by any means.  But I still bought this book off the strength of the reviews and respect for Victor's musicianship, hoping at least for a new perspective and some inspiration.<br /><br />What I got was...regrettable.  If you go into this book looking for any insight into how to play music better, it has very little to offer you.  Some, but not much.  The book provides the fictional account of Victor hitting a rough spot in his musical career and not being sure where to go next, when suddenly a magical Native American, free-spirited skateboard-riding \\"music teacher\\" appears in front of him and drops all kind of mental gems he'd never thought possible.  At first, he resists the advice of this strange being, but more and more it starts to make sense and revolutionizes how he feels about music.  Sorry, Music with a capital M.  This cliche is already old by the end of the first chapter, and it doesn't change or get any better from there.<br /><br />Just to give you an idea of what's in this book (spoilers, though I don't feel like there's much to spoil): on top of learning to play music better you'll also learn how to find a specific CD out of a collection of hundreds just by following the CD's energy, heal a recent car crash victim (also with your energy), talk to animals, and a whole lot of other stuff that I don't care to remember.  This can best be described as surreal fiction but doesn't even succeed on that level, as it reads as if it were written by an 8th grader and follows the same stale, repetitive format from the first page to the last.<br /><br />The extra star is because despite these complaints, there were a few thoughts sprinkled throughout the book that I do actually find useful and applicable to my playing.  \\"Never lose the groove to find a note,\\" for example.  Unfortunately they were few and far between, I can't remember them all, and would never subject myself to reading through this again to find them.  If he just took the useful bits out and published them in a pamphlet, I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />But who am I to complain?  Obviously most of the other reviewers got something out of this, maybe you will too.  If you're annoyed by my review and like the others, this might be a good read.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's Game is well written and an interesting story about the younger years of a gifted boy. The boy struggles with his gift and the journey he must complete in order to save mankind.<br />Once his mission is complete the story ends shortly thereafter, leaving me with a sense of loss. I had become very empathetic to Enders pain.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|This is a great movie.  I think Ridley Scott did a great job with this prequel.  The answers you are looking for are right there in the movie.  They are subtle, but they are there.  Where did the original aliens come from?  He answers it. He does leave it open for more movies and deeper meaning, but the basic answers are in this one.  If you are a Sci-fi fan, then this is for you.

B008JFC6F0|5.0|With their 2nd album, this Australian band has risen to the forefront of emerging bands ushering<br />  in a new age of genuinely psychedelic pop.  They've created a place where bubbling harmonies<br />  flow like ocean froth in a rainbow splatter of shimmering love caverns.  Like all the best<br />  psychedelia, the threat of chaos is ever imminent, but always held in check by melody.  Imagine<br />  if the Beach Boys took just a little too much acid.  This is beautiful, cinematic, kaleidoscopic pop<br />  with an oscillating 60s vibration; high caliber conceptual tomfoolery for black light cloud-float pop<br />  dancing.  Recalls bands like the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, Dreamies, Small Faces, Bubble<br />  Puppy, the Beatles, the Nazz, Pond, MGMT, Baby Woodrose.  Excellent happy merry-go-round<br />  tripping music for the brain-smile of eternal youth.  Cool, yummy acid bliss-pop.
0385344333|2.0|I have always been a great fan of Lee Child and Jack Reacher.  In this book, however, I was  disappointed by the lack of real plot.  It seemed more of an early exercise rather than a finished book.  The \\"blink\\" code used by one of the characters is ridiculous, as is the plot itself.  There is no real sense to it; it certainly is not evenly paced.  At first it moves very slowly with several twists that serve no reason except to take up pages.  Then at the end everything is played out and \\"explained\\" in a very slipshod manner, leaving many unanswered questions.<br />Lee Child has written much better stories than this.  I can only hope this one is a temporary aberration, and he returns to his old form quickly.
B008K7WCJM|4.0|16th? studio album from New York band led by Michael Gira:  It's primal, conceptual dark-rock<br />  pulled from the most forbidden, dangerous areas of the human soul--a place where Gothic folk,<br />  rumbling experimental down-melody and post-industrial demon-breath noise mix with<br />  provocative intent and dramatic flourish. There is a power here that can be beautiful, but is not<br />  always nice.  Gira can be the bringer of a gigantic, enveloping darkness, with all the mayhem<br />  and intense depth of terror that indicates; or he can caress with a portentous paw, strumming<br />  chant-like tales of alluringly apocalyptic folk mysticism.  His permeating baritone voice,<br />  fascination with the genuinely macabre and unflinching artistic willingness to reach into unknown<br />  realms gives an unusual weight to the band's creations and colors the often dense atmosphere<br />  with a foggy grey allure.  Band members on this epic double cd/lp have played with Circus Mort,<br />  the Heroine Sheiks, Shearwater, Ministry/KMFDM.  Guest artists include members of Low, Big<br />  Blood, Fire on Fire, Angels Of Light, Mercury Rev, Spacehog, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Akron/Family<br />  and former Swans member Jarboe.  \\"The Seer\\", like much of life, is not easy, but it can be rewarding
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Amazing book! Ton of action beginning not so much, but its great. Katniss adventure is a little more risky, read to find out more!
B008966SIU|5.0|4th studio album from these experimental Brooklyn artists--a gently haunting roar of innovative,<br />  fresh-sounding, melodic art-pop/rock with vocal harmonies & ringing guitars/synthesizers amidst<br />  a swirling m&eacute;lange of stimulating progressive sonic radiance that's both accessible and inspiring.<br />  It's a perfectly congruent, fluid fusion of experimentation and the gracefully grand side of melody.<br />  Includes members from Earl Greyhound, Department Of Eagles, CANT.  Comparisons could be<br />  made to bands such as Radiohead, Deerhoof, Animal Collective, Neutral Milk Hotel, the High<br />  Llamas, Brian Eno, City Center.  \\"Shields\\" carries a subtle, but significant, sense of addictive<br />  beauty.  Quietly stunning.
B009IQ1HBI|5.0|Ellie Goulding gives me chills up and down my spine and so does this CD.  When \\"Lights\\" came out I was estatic but when I heard \\"My Blood\\" I was a fan forever.  That song sends me to a world where there is peace.  Her voice is mesmerizing and cant get enough of her.  Looks like a bright future for this british goddess.<br /><br />MusicManDave
B008B11R1Q|3.0|2nd release from British band--soothing, minimalist snippets of gentle electronic guitar beat-pop<br />  with an elegantly soulful aura.  I thought their self-titled 2009 release was fascinating,<br />  mesmerizing.  \\"Coexist\\" is haunting, quiet and a bit too subtly nondescript/predictable/<br />  pretentious to consistently hold my attention, though there are some nice moments.  Sometimes<br />  recalls Young Marble Giants, Belle & Sebastian, Everything But the Girl, Portishead, Depeche<br />  Mode.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Great fun, received it much sooner than expected. Makes the same noises as the Doctor's and the UV ink and light is pretty nifty.

0316077046|3.0|I read Beautiful Creatures and loved it! I read this sequel. It was good but I think it should have been a shorter book. Because at first it started off great. Then you had a big chunk of pages where within those pages not much is happening except Lena was hanging out with Ridley and John Breed this mysterious Incubus that can walk in the day light. Also Lena is grieving for the death of her Uncle Macon and Ethan is sad cause shes avoiding him and Lena blames herself. Its like okay we understand that it doesn't need to be a big 250 chunk first part of a book. The second half of the book was more exciting though. A lot of shocking secrets come out and there are mysterious twists and turns and it leaves you open mouthed like I never thought that was going to happen. So what I would do if I were you is read the very very beginning of the book then skip more of the beginning and read the second half. You'd be fine skipping a lot of it and going to the second half. This book was good but not fantastic. Like it could have done without all of that beginning stuff.
B002361MLA|5.0|Reading the words of this book instantly triggers an almost trancelike sense of presence. Powerful and easy to read. The exercise are very helpful tools to become more skillfully at presence. This book is life changing. Thank you Eckhart Tolle.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Wow. Terrific. Better than the first one. A bit more polished, the harmonies are even a bit better. Honorable mention to Winnie's banjo picking on Hopeless Wanderer. Have to disagree with another reviewer who found the banjo parts repetitive. On the contrary, he always changes things up a little. The vocals on the bonus track For Those Below give me a suggestion to offer the band. Nothing against Marcus' vocals, but on this track the other lads voices are more prominent, and it would add some variety if on future albums they got to shine a bit more, since they can all obviously sing well.  Even the Beatles let Ringo sing once in a while. I'll enjoy this album for a long long time.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie!<br />Movie is about a group of policemen who decide they don't want to be just \\"good enough\\" fathers anymore.  They make a pact and agree to become better fathers and examples to their families.<br />Such an emotional roller coaster!  Really really funny moments, but also very very sad moments.  Very gospel-based. Great message for families, esp. for fathers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|while i do admit its still a little buggy its about a hundred times better than the xperia play version. which though you had actual psp like controls lagged drastically when ever you got to close to any mob. not saying the kindle fire version is flawless but its an enormous improvement over the xperia play. none the less i rate 5 stars because mojang is still releasing updates for every offical version and i see them working the bugs out eventually. i do play the pc version and the pocket edition is ever so nice to have when your riding the bus or out at the beach.

B0017APPSE|3.0|Loved the movie the first time I saw it. Then I read the book which was great, and watched the movie again. Now I realize how much it leaves out, and I ended up explaining everything to to my family who didn't read the book.

0316228532|1.0|Couldn't bring myself to continue reading after the first seven pages.  Somehow I expected a charming, well-written story with interesting characters and intriguing background.  What I got was the British version of a Danielle Steele novel.  For those who are looking for a charming, gentle read, this is NOT it.  Lesson to self: never assume that a great writer will continue to be a great writer when changing genres.

B00884GR0W|5.0|I truly love it! Runs great and way better than outdated minecraft.Even if you don't like fighting monsters (150 different mobs) you can still build your house and simply live. You still have to find materials to craft so have fun searching. map is truly endless. Go too far from home and you get lost. Really not fun when that happens. You can either build a mansion or castle or the biggest and baddest monsters you have ever seen. Enjoy,I know you will!!!

B008OJ291W|5.0|I've been an ELO fan since the beginning, so I've heard all of these songs hundreds (at least) of times. I've never purchased an ELO \\"greatest hits\\" disc or albumn and was skeptical about this one. When I saw Jeff was re-recording all of the songs, and not just re-mastering, I was curious enough to buy. I've had the CD for two days now and all I can say is that I cannot stop listening to it!! While there are no drastic changes to the originals, all of the instruments and vocals sound much cleaner and better paced.<br /><br />I know many of the posters have said they like the originals better. I'm the opposite. I LOVE these new versions. They sound fresh and like they could be hits on the radio today. I was particularly happy with Showdown and 10538 Overture which always sounded muddy to me even though I liked the songs. I also really love the intro to Evil Woman. The piano sounds incredible.<br /><br />And last, but not least, the new release, Point of No Return. This song is truely new and not an unreleased re-tread from an older albumn/CD. If this song ever gets any type of airplay, it could be a hit. I played it for my 10 and 12 year old kids and they were bopping along loving it!<br /><br />This is a must buy for ELO fans, and I would strongly suggest that non-ELO fans give it a listen as well.

0316212377|5.0|The Gzilt are about to transition from the Real to the Sublime, where they will live a blissful existence in dimensions seven through eleven.  In most instances, an entire civilization must enter the Sublime at the same time to retain individual identities, and this is what the Gzilt are preparing to do in 24 days.  When a ship from the Zihdren-Remnanter attempts to deliver a message to the Gzilt -- a message that could undercut the very foundation of Gzilt society and possibly affect the civilization's readiness to join the Sublime -- a Gzilt ship blows it to bits.  Ever watchful, the Culture dispatches Caconym, one of its Mind ships, to join an advisory group that is responding to the incident.  Caconym is a logical choice since it shares its structure with another Mind that has actually been to, and returned from, the Sublime.<br /><br />Other than various Minds, the central character in Iain Banks' latest Culture novel is a Gzilt named Vyr Cossant, who added two arms to her body so she could play The Hydrogen Sonata on the elevenstring.  Because she once met an entity (sometimes humanoid, sometimes not) named Ngaroe QuRia who has lived for thousands of years, Cossant is recommissioned as a lieutenant commander and ordered to find QuRia.  QuRia is thought to possess the information that the Zihdren-Remnanter were attempting to deliver to the Gzilt.  Also making an attempt to find QuRia is his former lover, Scolliera Tefwe, whose consciousness has been stored on a Culture ship for the last four hundred years.  As the Gzilt countdown to the Sublime continues, Cossant and Tefwe and a number of Culture Minds race to uncover the truth about the Gzilt before the civilization makes its collective journey, a task that is impeded by some Gzilt political/military folk who would prefer that the information remain buried.<br /><br />There is, of course, quite a bit more going on:  political scheming to determine which race will become the rightful heir to the worlds and possessions the Gzilt leave behind; political quarrels among the Culture Minds; military maneuverings leading to explosive confrontations between the Gzilt, the Culture, and others.  All of this adds up to a fun, intelligent, fast-moving story.<br /><br />The best thing about The Hydrogen Sonata is that it is wildly imaginative without becoming too silly.  From the descriptions of alien beings to the wonders offered by other planets, Banks creates a fully realized environment.  He effectively conveys a sense of the age and vastness of the universe, plays with theories about other universes/dimensions that might exist, and peppers the story with a wonderful array of gadgetry.  Not all of this is original, of course, but Banks often uses technology and theory in original ways.<br /><br />I particularly like Banks' playfulness:  the amusing names the Culture gives its ships; the banter between ships' Minds; the quirky personalities the Minds develop; the nettlesome nature of inter-species politics; a dirigible that hosts a five-year-long going-away party prior to the Sublime; an avatar whose head is made of alphabet soup; the fact that audiences other than academics and Culture Minds regard The Hydrogen Sonata (which may or may not be a musical representation of the periodic table) as unlistenable; the snarky pet Cossant wears around her neck; an android that mistakenly believes it's in a simulation as mayhem surrounds it; some truly bizarre sexual escapades ...  and more.<br /><br />The novel concludes with an intriguing moral equation.  Members of the Culture learn that a shared belief critical to Gzilt civilization is false.  Should the Culture reveal the truth on the ground that it is always best for the truth to be known?  Or should the Culture keep quiet to protect the Gzilt from the social disruption that the truth might cause?  An interesting quandary, but this isn't the kind of science fiction that lends itself to deep thought.  It's meant to be fun and exciting,and it achieves that goal admirably.  If I could, I would give The Hydrogen Sonata 4 1/2 stars.and it achieves that goal admirably.  If I could, I would give The Hydrogen Sonata 4 1/2 stars.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|After reading the three book series at the recommendation of my four grandchildren, and enjoying the books tremendously, I looked forward to the release of this DVD.  What a let down!!  The film was just awful!  Very poor adaptation of a wonderful book!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very interesting story out of a genre that has gotten a bit worn out over the years.  A great value for the price, and probably a must buy for fans of the SciFi apocalypse future type stories.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Like most people going to watch a movie based on a board game, I went into this with low expectations.  What I came out with was an experience that was so much fun I'm writing a review!  Yes, there were plot holes.  Yes, some of it was unrealistic, but honestly, what is it about invading aliens that anyone can say is realistic?  My advice is much like so many others:  Don't worry about it and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />This is a great movie full of eye candy, quotable one liners, likable characters, and happy fun time explosions.<br /><br />P.S. No, the aliens are not like transformers, except that they have moving parts and are made of metal.

I am not really sure what the point is supposed to be. I felt better when I read the other amazon reviews and saw that many others felt the same way. It's just kinda boring and not funny at all. And I think Ellen is a pretty funny person. Anyway, I'd like to get an hour of my life and my 15 bucks back!

B007I2BZIE|3.0|When I first heard the first two singles from this album before it came out I was psyched Rush was doing an album this heavy but when I bought the album it leaves a lot to be desired. it starts off with a band with Caravan, BU2B, and Clockwork Angels but after that it took a confusing left turn for me. Some of Geddy's vocals are a little too shreaky and turns me off from the songs and some of their string arrangments on this album dosen't help either. I have to say i like 7 out of the 12 songs on here. I recommend their earlier records though.
B0053O89WY|3.0|This was a good season with the addition of the rest of the girls to the regular cast., especially the  characther of Amy (malyk). But i don't think is a good idea story wise the weeding of Howard and Bernadette. They starting to run out of ideas.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|\\"The 100-Year Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared\\" is one of the most delightful books I have read in a long time.  I has a compelling hero, idiotic villains and presents a whimsical, alternative version of 20th century history. If you associate Swedish literature with dark, morose characters; this will alter that perception. If I provide any more details it will spoil the fun of reading this.

B008I3R2VG|5.0|I have to admit that I'm a huge Killers fan. Yes, I even liked Day & Age, even though it was a big leap forward from Sam's Town and Hot Fuss. So, I splurged and bought the Deluxe edition of Battle Born, which has the additional songs on it.<br /><br />I loved this disc. Overall, I thought that Battle Born was a great blend of the style and rhythms from Sam's Town and Day & Age, definitely providing for a segue way into the Day & Age album. As Flowers said in an interview, perhaps they should have made Battle Born before Day & Age, but hindsight is always 20/20.<br /><br />Even loving the overall album, there are a couple of songs that just don't resonate as well with me, but typically, you should encounter that with every album you listen to... after all, the artists don't have a direct lead into your heart/mind over their own or anyone elses'...<br /><br />#4 - Here with Me - definitely didn't enjoy it the first time I heard the song, but it's definitely grown on me. I think it's probably the only song that I kinda like/kinda not like.<br /><br />#9 - Heart of a Girl - I just can't identify with this song. Musically, it's a gorgeous song, but I just can't get into it. Maybe this is another one that needs many more listens... I think it's the odd song out, meaning it just doesn't quite fit musically with the rest of the album.<br /><br />#14 - Flesh and Bone, the Jacques Lu Cont remix - I hate this remix. I've never hated a song as vehemently as I do this one. It's taking Flesh and Bone, which is the #1 track on the album, and a great track on its own, and remixing it to a dance-funk beat. Five plus minutes of dance-pop, with the last minute and a half a repeat of the same club beat and lyrics. Really? That's what the producers remixed it to? I hate, hate, hate this song. It's taking typical Killers rhythms and lyrics and turning it into some kind of dance-pop remix. I don't know if they're trying to lure in a new crowd (the pop crowd, whose musical taste is non-existent) with this remix or if it was a spur of the moment thing. Either way, this remix is terrible. I'm hoping that it was just an experiment, and that it'll never happen again... please?<br /><br />Other than these, which stand out as ... interesting and terrible... Battle Born is a great album. I'm impressed with how the Killers are growing musically, and I can't wait to see where they take us next!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Couldn't get enough of this series, Christian Grey is strange but amazing, it brought out all the emotions in one read. Highly recommend....

B007SGM084|5.0|Great trilogy. Liked how Kindle did it with the table of contents and chapters. This book is different than I thought it would be. Heard about what it was supposed to be about and did not go into it with an open mind. It is a love story! Ended up liking it, although it is VERY much like the Twilight Series. It is far from realistic but what fictional book isn't? That's why we read them right?
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I ordered the Kindle version of BLS and read through it in one evening. It's well written and very informative.
030758836X|3.0|Generally I shy away from fiction on the best seller list but I made an exception here after reading the jacket information. With Kindle I find that I often read something without any clue as to the content. I love certain authors, certain subject matter and almost anything which appears on the long or short lists by the folks who compile these for the Booker Prize. This little prejudice stems from the pure crap which often parades as literature these days. This is not to say that just because it is a best seller it isn't literature because in some cases the writing and story line are exceptional. And I have read the Hunger Trilogy, Twilight and the Millennium Trilogy. The latter I consider extremely well written, cleverly laid out and properly paced. I'm not sure how much of that was due to translation. What bothers me is the idea that since sex sells there must an abundance of it and the more graphic the better. Some of the best authors of all times were able to get across the same idea without ever mentioning a body part or actual conduct. But I digress. And this one has a bit more gratuitous bed play and language than I thought necessary. I almost expect the publisher sent it back for a rewrite to put some of that in.<br /><br />The author is a Missouri native but lives in Chicago. The first of her three novels, Sharp Objects, won much critical acclaim but was not as successful as this one.<br /><br />What made me consider this one was the similarity of the description to a disappearance and murder in the Chicago area which without finding the body put the husband on trial in the case of a previous wife who drowned in a bath tub. His latest wife has been gone without a clue for over a year. I would suspect the author might have considered this and wondered how that could happen. The action starts in New York City and then takes us to small town Missouri. The female lead, Amy Elliot (Angelina Jolie as she was in Mr. & Mrs. Smith) is a 30 something writer who wasthe subject matter of a series of very successful kiddy lit from the time of her youth. Her parents are college professors from the east coast who fictionalized their daughter's life and parlayed it into a fortune. The male lead, Nick Dunne (picture a younger Jeff Daniels) is a writer as well from the Midwest who is a laid back type who just happens to be a good writer and landed a dream job in the Big Apple. When their idyllic world begins to crumble they make a move back to the land of his childhood still peopled with his twin sister, who after all these years is still single, his mom dying of cancer, and his father slipping further and further into fiery Alzheimer's.<br /><br />The culture shock which they initially seek to overcome slips into the background when on their fifth anniversary The Amazing Amy disappears. The crime scene begins to suggest the perp was someone very close to her. When the police run out of clues and ideas it appears they begin to receive help from the other side of the grave. Public reaction is manipulated by both sides with a big assist from the \\"Media\\". I could predict some aspects but not the ending. It should be a felony to reveal the outcome of the disappearance of Gone Girl, the Amazing Amy. 2.75* GIBO
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Shot on super 16mm film. Beautifully directed, acted, and edited. The pacing is excellent throughout. Yet for all that it shows the restraint of mastery. It tells its story with one beautifully composed shot after another, using the simplest cinematic techniques and executing them brilliantly. The story is touching and is told with a great deal of both humor and sensitivity, and it's acted by some of the best in the business. But the kids still steal the show. In this film a wonderful story is paired with great storytelling, and the result is powerful and haunting.
0307956350|3.0|There aren't many novels where I discover one of the most important aspects until more than a day after finishing the book. In this case it hit me while driving to a restaurant after church.<br /><br />This one is a spy story of sorts involving the CIA, the FBI and Interpol, as well as a few other organizations private and otherwise who are not named. Those of you familiar with the baseline genre know that the best laid plans are merely the framework and your better authors build in the double and triple cross. All the clues are there either as innocuous little asides or clear foreshadowing. Straight-line narrative will never be found in this world and typically there is the narrator who will remain unidentified plus the protagonist from whose point of view the scenario devolves.<br /><br />Kate Moore might be living a life of quiet desperation in D.C. with her quiet, studious, unglamorous husband whose main function in life is to sit in front of a computer and make sure the bad guys don't rob everyone else blind. Bur her back story is considerable. She is a mother of two small children working for the State Dept as a paper pusher and file analyst. Right? Well one day Dexter (I know) comes home and says pack your bags we're moving to Luxemburg. The rest of the story folds and unfolds on the Continent with side trips to Paris, Barcelona, Munich, Strasburg, etc, etc. While settling into hubby's new job, God knows where, they meet a lovely couple who are clearly too damn perfect. Bill is a bon vivant and the kind of guy every man and woman wishes they knew and were best friends with. Julia is a bit more frau and a good, caring coffee mate for Kate. You know better and so does Kate but Dex, well he is working too hard somewhere and apparently oblivious. Kate makes a decision to fill herself in on everyone's information and her training is exactly what is necessary to out the rest.<br /><br />The author, Chris Pavone, is a book writer and ghost writer and has been in thebook business for 25 years. He is a former editor at Clarkson Potter (really) and this is his first novel. He of course lives in New York City and environs.<br /><br />This one is a fast read if not a little complicated due to the unfamiliarity most of us have with international banking, cyberspace and computer hacknology. There are very few characters and how they fit in generally is obvious. The nature of the core transaction is what might be a tad hard to follow except you don't need to understand the basics. You might have to examine your moral compass here and there to decide how to cut up the knot but if you find that you don't know what really major fact was left out then give me a call and I'll give you  a clue. 2.5* GIBO

1455502758|4.0|You may recall my discussion of Christopher Hitchens in my review of Hitch 22 on July 21, 2010. He famously debated his brother Peter at GVSU in April 2008 and parts of that may still be available on youtube. Part of my description follows towit- \\"He began his political career while a student as a demonstrator, activist, reactionary, almost revolutionist, Marxist, atheist (secular humanist), protest whore and rabble rouser; and that is his description. He prefers the term Trotskyite. Others have described him as pompous, over blown, narcissistic, grandiose, overly analytical- unwilling to grant any point even for the sake of the argument, and egotistical. Hey nobody's perfect. He is also considered elegant, classy, charismatic, speaks the upper British vernacular, has an almost unequaled intellect (uses words like apotropaically & Brobdingnagian) and a razor sharp edge in debating able mentally to cross reference everything he has ever read, seen or heard. He was a frequent guest on Firing Line and many other debate formats. He noted that the problem with Marx was that he failed to grasp the revolutionary nature of capitalist innovation. He also left the Left which he felt lost its moral advantage when it became credential to be Black, gay, female, handicapped, etc rather than being on the ground in the struggle or at least down for it\\".<br /><br />You will recall at that time I also noted he was suffering from Esophageal cancer. He has in the interim died, without I might add, a deathbed conversion from his avowed Atheism. Well he, or rather his survivor, has published a book which was to be his final book, entitled Mortality (as opposed apparently to immortality). It is not nearly as long as he had hoped and towards the end is simply snippets. Notwithstanding its brevity it nevertheless sparkles with his wit, wisdom and intellect.<br /><br />His bent was to write the way one speaks and not many were his speaking equal. His favorite things on earth were cigarettes,Scotch, good writing, company & conversation. He wrote books, essays, papers and book reviews. He was the consummate raconteur. He passed away December 15,2011 at age 62. To his dismay and amusement there was an \\"Everybody Pray for Hitchens\\" day proclaimed by some of his friends and acquaintances September 20, 2010. I purchased this small volume on the anniversary of that date. 2.75* GIBO

055380684X|5.0|Great book with some flaws but buy it and study it well.<br /><br />Flaw on 'short term memory' - in fact it IS like a shoe size. That was a totally distorted portion of the book. The fact that people can remember 80 digits or more still boiled down to the 80digits being chunked in groups (of 7 or so).<br /><br />Flaw on Carol Dweik's experiment: indeed she trains one group with study skills and fluid mindset. But this fluid mindset teaching is not exclusively about neurons, but rather it is about the concept of fluid and fixed mindset. The books implies that the key difference is one group is taught exclusively about neurons (myelination, etc.)<br /><br />Those were two flaws I was instantly able to detect. I don't like flaws, not since Jonah Lehrer was fired recently.<br /><br />But overall a 5 star book. Wish there was more practicable advice on ignition.
2070643026|4.0|Jean-François Ménard does an exceptional job with the translation. All the major character conflicts that captivated me in English are equally conveyed within the French edition. I was pleased to note that all of Hagrid's foibles; every moment of quippy banter curtsey of the Weasely twins; and every heartfelt anxiety experienced by the young Gryffindor students translates fluently across languages. I would certainly recommend the Harry Potter series as an introduction into reading French for the French intermediate student. Overall, a very enjoyable read!
B0070NSPCU|4.0|WOW! As near as I can tell this is self published as an E book only, If so that makes it even more impressive. This is a really good fantasy novel.

Low magic, gritty realism without descending into flat out gore, the world Ryan has built thus far is simple and logical and just enough different from ours. The main and supporting characters a memorable and realistic, The mark of a good book, I can't wait to see what happens next. Also, Just saying... what did it cost 2.99? how can you go wrong?

B000EWBKK8|4.0|I'll get to the point (I'm not a fan of 2-page Essay reviews) and I don't like ruining movies for fellow watchers.<br /><br />I thought this film had a great/complex story line. It definitively keeps you hooked, it is well narrated and character driven. The story-line plays out decently, taking you through an emotional roller coaster from love & hate to action, betrayal, cold-blooded murder, loyalty, courage etc. . The cast is rich with well seasoned actors, Ethan Hawke was awesome but Nicholas Cage was impervious.<br /><br />Overall in the end the movie had a great message and it actually opens your eyes to what's really going on in the world...
B0095VP8D4|5.0|The title says it all. Eyefinity without a dedicated graphics card. Great for multimedia users that want to get the biggest bang for their buck. AMD has pulled no punches in the competition to compete with Intels mid-tier CPUs. If you are considering an APU for your new build i would highly recommend this one. It is a great deal, and with a dedicated graphics card it becomes a great budget gaming rig.
B003IDMUWM|5.0|Couldn't dare put my kindle down.  Worth every dime. Check it out. Grisham is a great writer.Real thriller indeed. Thanks
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The book has gotten boring and predictable.  There are pages and pages of childish emails sent back and forth between the characters.  The author could have written one book and captured an  interesting story line.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was not your normal war story book.  It was a very spiritual book about someone that had a connection to a higher power and found the true light to what living up to your values was all about and was able to channel his energy into the job of being a Navy Seal. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be motivated in their ivies
B000067QMD|1.0|These really dont do anything special. I cant find a use for them. The AVENT bottles are a great way to waste your money. Shame on Philips for guilting people into buying AVENT products. There are many many many more products that will do the same thing for 1/5 the price
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Too long and boring.  I was looking forward to seeing this and it was not what I expected.  My son and I are into fantasy and sci-fi movies.  He fell asleep !
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I chop, slice, dice, and down right murder fruit. It all must die. I kill it all day long without the mess that Gallager faces everytime he meets a watermellon.
030758836X|3.0|So, a lot of reviews here making the same complaint and I agree.  Ending really wrecks it, and it's too bad.  The characters were well developed and there were times when I was saying some pretty nasty things out loud in response to the plot....BUT, let's just say that it was a good story that made me feel used and a little stupid in the end.  I really wish she hadn't done that.  It could have been so much better.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is the most amazing thing about ebay, thier app is better than thier site.They should be proud and disappointed in thierselfs!

B001AU8ZLK|5.0|I've been a Coldplay fan for over 8 years, and next to A Rush of Blood, this album resonates with flowing melodies and anthem choruses.  Favorites of mine include \\"Cemeteries of London\\", \\"42\\", \\"Lovers in Japan\\", a cool almost country acoustic love song \\"Strawberry Swing\\", and \\"Death and all of his friends\\".  Of course, there's the anthem \\"Viva La Vida\\", but the other songs sing deeper into the soul of the album, with Chris Martin's piano backed by Jonny's soaring and echoing guitar on \\"Death...\\", Will's pounding drums, and Guy's rhythmic bass.<br /><br />A true favorite album that I continue to play over and over on my iPod that makes my commutes much more enjoyable.
B00004YRQA|5.0|I ordered an 8 MB Play Station 2 Memory Card, but got a 16 MB instead, idk if it was a mistake or not, but it works perfectly and worth the 8 dollars.
B009JBZH54|5.0|So I absolutely loved all these movies...very well done, especially Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises!  I already own Batman Begins and The Dark Knight on Blu-Ray, but I am trading them up and getting this collector's set, simply because it's awesome and I am a big fan of boxed sets!  Too cool!  :-)
B00335EQ0E|4.0|I loved the story of Alice from the first time I read it as a child.  It is the 3rd most quoted literature in English after the Bible and Shakespeare.  The surrealism does a better job of portraying the absurdity of our modern world than any other piece.<br /><br />I have yet to see a film that does justice to Alice, but Disney comes closest, and is therefore the best way to introduce children and uninitiated adults to Wonderland.  Salvador Dali praised Disney as America's only real surrealist, and the surrealism is adeptly employed in this wonderful film.<br /><br />This may be my favorite of all the animated Disney films.
B000002GB6|5.0|I bought the album thirty five years ago. While looking through my album collection I'd stumbled across this album and decided to get the Cd. Of course the Cd sounds a lot better than the Lp.
B008DVJO8C|1.0|this and the HELLYEAH-turd are easily the two worst 'metal' (haha, yeah, right) albums of the years. an incoherent bloodless collection of cookie-cutter riffs that no good band with self-respect would recycle for their mediocre songs. but not so the lads and gals from ITM. interviews confirm that they entered the studio with a handful of riffs and seemingly no ideas and hoped a produced would do his magic. whoever tried... he failed. miserably. an unbelievable letdown for me, and I loved the debut and at least thought the other releases were decent genre-products. pass on this on and buy/listen (to) something else /good (but NOT Hellyeah!).
B0093LFXIG|5.0|I just finished reading Unsaid Things, and it took me less than a day to finish the whole book (even going to classes) because I was so hooked. I've been a McFly fan for a while, and I fell in love with every single member of mcfly all over again. I started out laughing, and I then cried, and smiled. I now understand so many things, and I am so happy I read this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app - works great on my Kindle Fire. Also use on my computer and iphone.  Fast loading - works great!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I remember being so amped to see this flick in theaters. I let my son miss school so we could see it ASAP on opening day! It was awesome!!! Needless to say, we we're looking forward to getting this on Blu-ray. I just ordered & recieved this Blu-ray(2 disc version)off of amazon. I'm not going to go into details about the film...Cause I would say a vast majority of people reading this has seen this. What I will bring up is things about the Blu-ray. The product comes with a slip cover to put over the case. The slip is well designed, with sharp imagery,vibrant color,and has a texture to it so you can feel the outline of the characters,ect.. on the slip. This set comes with both a Blu-ray & DVD disc. You also get instructions on how to sync the movie to your ipad,ipod,ect...to play on it, while it's playing in your Blu-ray player. You'll need to get an app to do that (go figure). This feature in my opinion isn't really necessary. But some people may like that....The quality of the DVD is good (especially on LCD's,Plasma,& LED). The sound is good and will be awesome if you have a surround sound set up! It's really sharp picture and crisp sound if you play the DVD in a Blu-ray player with HDMI hook-up 7 surround sound. The Blu-ray disc is of course better quality. But in all honesty, if you have a newer TV w/ Blu-ray player.HDMI, and surround sound, it's great either way (and damn near identical). I had seen this film in 3D upon it's theatrical opening day. And so I was looking forward to watching it in 2D too! I was great!!!! I've been a big fan of super heroes, their comics,toys,cartoons,ect...since I was a kid. So because of that reason I won't say this flick is for everyone. However, I know many people which haven't been into any type of comic book/super heroes. And they have really enjoyed some of the Marvel films that have been released (especially this)!!! I do definetly recommend this Blu-ray set to anyone that does follow comic book characters on all levels (comics,TV,film,ect..).s,TV,film,ect..).
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wasn't sure what this book was about but i knew a movie was coming out based on it.  surprisingly good book

B002G1YPH0|4.0|I bought this CPU fan thinking the boxed i7 ivy bridge CPU wouldn't include a fan.  I was wrong and now I realize the fan boxed with the CPU might have sufficed.  A review of this CPU fan compared with the included Intel fan stated similar.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007SZ0EOW Intel Core i7-3770K Quad-Core Processor 3.5 GHz 8 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80637I73770K]]<br />[[ASIN:B007G51UWY ASUS P8Z77-V LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard]]<br />[[ASIN:B0026FCI2U Cooler Master HAF 922 Mid Tower Computer Case with USB 3.0 Ports (RC-922M-KKN3-GP)]]<br /><br />The fan takes up quite a bit of room on top of the motherboard as well as case space, but it does fit fine including with all memory slots filled.  As to whether it does a better job then the generic fan, I'm not too sure.<br /><br />Compiled a Gentoo system and see absolutely no overheating with this fan.  I think the HD4000 (Intel CPU graphics incl. in CPU) is running at 82F.  Much much cooler then a NVidia chip. As I tinker, I think the reason why I have such a low temperature is because of my very well ventilated case with three large fans.  A review on phoronix.com performing a comparison against AMD's chips using apparently stock fans and those tiny mini cases,reported 100-122F temperatures when rendering high frame rate games and benchmarking.<br /><br />Looking back at my boring non-overclocking past history with chips and hard drives failing every now and then, this fan definitely adds a little extra insurance.  I also believe it's likely more quieter then the default Intel fan.
B005S9ELM6|5.0|Despite knowing the outcome, the viewer can feel the tension ratchet up. All the actors hit the real notes. No foolish acting, just real scared people, in deadly situations. And when the real photos flash at the end, those without knowledge of the events will marvel at the recreations. Ben is not afraid to treat his audience with intelligence. He deserves any awards available.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I have seen all four seasons now. I loved every episode, but one needs to see the entire series to appreciate the overall story in this \\"Small Town\\" life with each of these individual characters and the trials they go through. I was able to relate to so much of this and I loved the way it ended.
B004TTHLBE|3.0|I really enjoy Neil Gaiman. I even enjoyed this book. Unfortunately, I found no reason to complete it - I abandoned about two-thirds of the way through. How to reconcile those? Well, the situation in the book and Neil's imagination are fascinating. The main character is mildly interesting. But the story is not compelling. I knew we were heading somewhere, but I just didn't care. Glad I read what I read, didn't feel need to find out how things resolved.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Fast as can be.  Great box for the cool user.  Can't wait to show my friends. Super affordable and user friendly.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|First of all, this lens in often paired with a similar 18-55 mm lens in a \\"kit\\" with a camera body and sometimes a few other \\"doo-dads\\".  That means it is going to be an average lens for an average user.  A professional photographer might dismiss it, but keep in mind that one of his or her lens can easily cost more that the above mentioned \\"kit\\", including a bag, two lenses, and the camera body.<br /><br />On the other hand, if want a functional, budgetary lens that will do most of what you might reasonable want, this one is worth considering.<br /><br />Pro<br />- good zoom range<br />- image stabilization - can really make the difference in whether you get the shot you want or not.<br />- 55mm picks right up where the 18-55 leaves off and is very close (in range) to the 50mm lens often used for portrait type photography<br />- zooming up to 250mm will let you sit on one end of the deck and capture a hummingbird flitting around the feeder on the other end.<br />- zooming from 55mm to 250mm is smooth with no tight or jerky spots<br />- I already mentioned cost.  If, on the other hand, you've got money to burn and want bragging rights on top of that, you can spend as much as $35,000 on a single lens with a wider range and lower f-stop.<br /><br />Con<br />- If you plan on printing wall size posters, you may see some optical and chromatic aberration (in non-geek, not totally perfect image)For viewing on your typical computer monitor or printing 8x10's, it's really nothing to worry about unless you being paid to photograph a wedding and dealing with momzilla or bridezilla.<br />- It does require a reasonable amount of light for a good shot but much of that is offset by the built in image stabilization.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I read this book thinking it was from a different series of books and boy, what a happy mistake.  It starts off a little slow but still got me involved trying to figure out who is a good guy and who is not.  I'm thrilled to say that all does not seem to be cut and dry.  For a story filled with preternatural beings, the characters are very human.  I was thrilled with the different aspects of witch and vampire and how the author manages the contrast of the two main characters. I was lucky that the second book was just out when I finished this one because I don't think I could stand the wait twice.(already finished the 2nd, waiting for the 3rd) this is a must read!
0891349553|4.0|I love animals and I love miniatures. Thus, when I saw this book I bought it. It is a creative, useful and informative book and I can't wait to begin making some of the ten (10) animals in it: the deer mouse, the young cottontail, the harp seal, the black bear, the basset hound, the white-tailed fawn, the red fox, the bull frog, the bledgling bluebird and the siamese kitten. This is my only qualm. I understand a book is limited, but at just 128 pages, I feel the author could have added more creatures to make in added pages. All are adorable and realistic looking, except for the black bear. In my opinion, the bear looks a little too cute, not realistic at all. The bear looks more as if he belongs at Disney World as a character at the Country Bear Jamboree. The book is in full color with illustrations and step by step instructions. All in all, I feel this was a worthy purchase, though I didn't pay full price from Amazon and instead went with a market place seller. If you love animals, miniatures, or clay making, I recommend this book to purchase for yourself or for someone else.
B005SAJRV0|5.0|Best show ever! I've never laughed so hard! The characters each have a quality that make this such an enjoyable show. Gotta love Sheldon!
B00914JWSW|2.0|How many more \\"Best of\\" albums and re-released material does she have to push??.<br /><br />Yes, these are unreleased, but they are not of her today, she is making money off the public but simply re-engineering stuff that was left over.<br /><br />Like going to a restaurant and them making you pay for old stuff they had in the cupboard they wanted to get rid of.<br /><br />You can get these songs for free from YouTube and download them to your player.<br /><br />Again there will be another Release Me version 2, which will be pushed at top $$ soon.<br /><br />The photos in the booklet can be found on various fan sites, so basically you are paying for stuff you can get for free. Sounds a rip off to me !.<br /><br />She did have a great voice,and I do enjoy her music, but to charge big money during a tight economy to hear a 70 year old in concert singing the same old songs and same self adsorbed talk about her early career...I guess if you wanna add to her millions, then do so...<br /><br />Support up and coming singers like Lea from Glee.<br /><br />Spend you hard earned or saved cash on something nice for yourself or donate to a charity.
B003L77GH4|5.0|It was a great second season. I love all the characters especially Stefan. I love having it on DVD so that I can watch it whenever I like!
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|The incompetent writing and (therefore) appalling acting aside --Michael Fassbender's performance is lauded as the exception but an android surrounded by implausible humans would stand out, wouldn't it?-- this prequel --yes, it is most certainly a prequel-- is --to an Alien nerd/ardent cinema-goer like myself-- totally incoherent (much like this sentence with its various anacoluthons).<br /><br />If you don't wish to be (possibly) spoiled then don't read on.<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />Given that Prometheus is set before the time when the alien to which we are accustomed actually exists it is indeed puzzling why a certain scene early in the movie --at 39:52-- contains a certain mural which depicts, inexplicably, the alien to which we are accustomed. I watched over and over again to be certain I wasn't hallucinating. Alas, there 'twas in vivid detail, thus rendering Prometheus chronologically incomprehensible.<br /><br />This along with the film's other faults has disappointed me terribly. What has happened to the Riddler who made the original Alien, and Legend, and Hannibal (I know, but I love it so.)? He has frighted me with false fire. He promised me a gem with Prometheus and instead threw a pot of paste in my face.<br /><br />And don't bother listening to his audio commentary.  It is a truly disturbing experience.  When the Riddler isn't narrating the film like an audio track for the visually-impaired he's indulging in the most contemptible, the most vulgar self-congratulation.
1594203334|1.0|I wanted to finish the book and stay open minded. Midway through, I just couldn't take it any more. My free time is too precious to spend reading a book that depicts a total fantasy land. As someone who was raised in France of French parents and moved to America at age 22 to marry an American, I can assure you that the French way is by no stretch of the imagination the ideal parenting way. Oh for the parent maybe. If you read this book, you realize that's what it's about: making the parent feel better; making the parent's life easier. No where does it prove that the French kids are actually happier.  I also can't stand it, that she makes American women who quit their job(or French imports like me) who choose to be home with their child, who play with them at the playground (gasp!) and breastfeed them long term look like nut jobs who need to learn the \\"better way\\" from the French. Pelease!<br />I spend more time with my child than hired help. I breastfeed my toddler. I have a child who says please, thank you, sits quietly at the dinner table at a restaurant and gobbles down her spinach salad. I didn't need the creche to parent my child. I am the parent. I also work out and fit in my pre-pregnancy ideal weight jeans. The author seems to think that most American parents are clueless slobs like her.<br /><br />Oh and all that free stuff she refers to (creche, public preschool, healthcare, etc...) is NOT free. It's paid for by the enormous taxes that working people pay in France. So give me a break.<br /><br />America is so much better than France. Americans are by and large a much more generous inspiring people. America is such an awesome country. I may like croissants and I'll concede that I haven't found a baguette here that tastes as good as in France. But I'll take the USA over France any day. I'm glad Americans like her, do live abroad.<br /><br />A much better book to actually learn something about the French is [[ASIN:0062103296 French Kids Eat Everything: How Our Family Moved to France, Cured Picky Eating, Banned Snacking, and Discovered 10 Simple Rules for Raising Happy, Healthy Eaters]]. This book really does paint a pretty good picture of the french philosophy on how they feed their children and indeed it works pretty well.r Family Moved to France, Cured Picky Eating, Banned Snacking, and Discovered 10 Simple Rules for Raising Happy, Healthy Eaters]].

B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Marcus Mumford and his band did not radically re-invent themselves with this album, and (as some of the other reviews have noted) it's easy to draw parallels in the structure and themes between songs and even across their two albums.  It's still fun to listen to, though, and if you liked the style of 'Sigh No More,' 'Babel' is easy to recommend.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book kept my interest all the way through and the story line was intriging, but the ending was a total disappointment.  All of my friends agreed with me.  I was going to order all of the author's other books as I was reading, but changed my mind because of the ending.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a heart warming taken on a teenage love story. I definitely recommend this book. It's filled with quick witted humor. This should be on every ones reading list.
B006MPKAOI|4.0|Very well written.  I like the way it referenced both parts of her life at the same time.  Some of the information was very graphic and a little disturbing. Had a 'real life situation' feel to it.  Gives me a new perspective on what some women have/are going through.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read all of John Green's books and this is by far the best.  I didn't love Looking for Alaska or An Abundance of Katherines- but The Fault in Our Stars was brilliant.  Well-written and witty. I recommend it to any age!

B009CPES4I|5.0|Meant to see this in theater but couldn't. Felt like a child waiting waiting waiting until it finally became available. It was exactly as good as imagined it would be. The actors and actresses are superb. Most are long time favorites but the young man lead actor was very gifted & talented. The writing, acting, production, the entire package is just a great movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Amazingly informational application outlining almost every aspect of your battery usage. Once calibrated to your device, which admittingly takes quite some time, the app goes to work. You can see just how long you have left to use your device based on numerous factors such as what you're using it for, if you have wifi enabled, screen brightness, etc.<br /><br />There were a handful of reviews that stated issues with over heating, freezing, or other similar issues and seemed to think this application was to blame. I can honestly say that I was cautious because of such potentially serious issues and have closely watched the performance of my system since I began using this application. As of now nothing alarming has occurred nor do I feel that the problems stated are common.<br /><br />Great application. My Kindle Fire is better for having this as part of its core applications.

1449410243|5.0|This book saved my life!<br /><br />How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You gave me the information I needed to find out that my cat was, in fact, plotting to kill me!  This realization happened none to soon as well, as there was an ambush attack from the three of them not seconds after reading.  Thankfully through the other parts of the book outlying the interests of cat-assassins, I was able to distract them and get away.<br /><br />In all seriousness, this is the best book published in the history of publishing.  I considered eating it with sriracha to gain its awesomeness, but have instead opted to put it on my bookshelf for later reference.  It could come in handy for later attacks, after all, and it makes a great showpiece with my Wookie Jesus print.<br /><br />Thanks, Oatmeal!

B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game doesn't trap you! you simply have to go to stuff then click options then there is a door click exit. it takes like 2 seconds to get out of the game! also I'm to level 29 and haven't spent a dime. as for being marketed for kids my 6 and 4 year olds were bored in a day!
B00932AA5G|5.0|Very pleasantly surprised by this movie. The plot is amazingly well written, the actors are really talented.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|BUYER BEWARE!!!  I love this game, but the android version is not that great.  It doesn't have the same content as for the iOS version, yet it costs the same.  Do not buy if you are looking for the full version. If android users unite and stop buying ALL POPCAP games, maybe they will treat us with some respect and give us the same content as the iOS users.
0449012751|5.0|When I started this book I kept thinking about EAT PRAY LOVE and WILD, two recent books about taking off on a long excursion to learn about yourself.  I thought this might be just a rehash but from the point of view of a man instead of a woman and a man near the end of his life.  I was still thinking that for a little while into it but it really proved to be new and unique and beautiful.  Not only that but there were unexpected plot turns that made it compelling.  More \\"What is going to happen next?\\" than \\"What is he going to learn about himself next?\\"  I strongly recommend it.
B0087HT36U|5.0|many apps are throwaway garbage, that there is clearly no work or love put into it but I must say this game certainly didn't fall into that category. it is Fun, enjoyable, and provides quite a good time whether you are only killing time or in for a casual gaming mood.

B009B51K9U|5.0|Great CD every song on this CD is great.  I listen to it from beginning to end over and over and I love it. Love \\"Trouble Maker\\" \\"Let yourself go\\" \\"Kill the DJ\\" and of course \\"Oh Love\\".  This is a must have CD!!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I really liked this book and its a great ending to the series. this book was really enjoyable and funny to read.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|The artistry in this album is amazing. Their lyrics are heartfelt, their sound so original and lush, rarely have I heard such an album that stays true through all of the songs. It's hard to believe that they could improve upon their last album, but they did and in spades.
B0083GPDBO|2.0|Man it looked like my neighbor did a home video .  There was only a short period of good footage to it and I thought the acting was only fair at best
B008X8QCTO|5.0|Great game! Nice visuals and scenes. Storyline is creative with a freaky, disgruntled clown and Loki, God of Mischief. Liked the two worlds and theme park scenario. Crashed my kindle a few times. Boo! But overall would buy again.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I thought the movie moved to slow and there was a very weak storyline.  Effects where good but i need more than that.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|We had seen this film in the theater with our grandchildren and knew that we would purchase it when it came out on DVD. I bought the Blu-ray/Dvd. The quality was great and we enjoyed the movie as much as we did the first time we saw it. The grandchildren will ask to watch it when they are over and spending the night. They are between 7 and 14 years of age. We have a 37 inch television, so I found the quality of sound and picture to be very good. Could not comment on seeing it on larger televisions. At the end of the movie, they left you with the idea that they could make a sequel. I would be glad if they did so, very entertaining and well done.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This story made me stop and realize I'm always in too much of a hurry. I did slow down when I felt I was running late this week and it prevented me from a bad situation (bomb scare) at work.
B003UYUP58|4.0|Great review of modern history of cancer research, author enters the mind of the people of the times and really makes us understand their enthusiasm and folly. The only weakness is a lack of reflection and analysis, on why those enthusiasms turn to folly. As a narrative history, however, it is outstanding in its liveliness, intensity, and profound empathy.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I just bought this product (at a local store for the same price) and I'm in love! I'm more of a \\"budget\\" audiophile and my [[ASIN:B00001P4ZH Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case]] are my go-to headphones for work and home listening, either from my laptop or iPod/iPhone. PortaPros sound great as is, but this little Fiio E6 makes them sound AWESOME. This is great even with 128 kbps files, which I normally use (for space-saving). I don't hear any distortion with PortaPros + E6 with 128kbps files, but your ears may be more attuned than mine.<br />I don't love having to deal with extra cords, but the device is tiny and the included short audio cord works perfectly. All the included cords are thick and have gold connectors, so props to Fiio for providing decent, quality cords with their product.<br />The included instructions are pretty terrible, but the device is pretty straight forward. Side switch with +/- adjusts volume. Opposite side switch pushed UP for 3 secs turns the device on/off. When on, pushing up lets you scroll through the EQ settings. No LED = flat, Red LED = bass boost, Blue LED = mid boost, Purple LED = dB reduction for high level input. Personally, I like the \\"Blue\\" for a warm, rich sound with just the right amount of bass.<br />Pushing the on/off/EQ switch DOWN exposes an orange stripe and locks the device.<br />I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a little more from their music. Works great even with inexpensive headphones! Thanks Fiio for an affordable, quality product!<br /><br />NOTE: to those who said their device is DOA, you might have to charge it first. Mine had no charge out of the box. Just a note!
0525953728|5.0|Great book! One of the best I've ever read. Really puts you into the action and mindset. Very easy read as well, didn't take me long at all to finish. I didn't want to put it down

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I bought this book simply because a lot of people said it was good, or their favorite.But i really did like this book once I started reading it. I tend to love the book that center around collage because that's where a lot of good love stories begin.<br /><br />some people tend not to like this book but i believe anyone would be happy with it. you just have to connect with the characters.<br /><br />so if your 50/50 about buying it. Just buy it i dont think you'll regret this book. Plus who doesnt love a hot bad boy falling in love??;)

B007SGM084|4.0|It took me an entire weekend, but I couldn't put it down. An excellent read ...<br />If only life were so simple.
B00573YVVY|5.0|I found Obama's memoir completely engrossing. It is a challenging, and sometimes confronting, account of a young man's struggle to define himself and find purpose in a complex world. While the protagonist undertakes a personal journey of discovery, he raises questions for all of us to ponder and poignantly explores the difficulties faced by young men growing to maturity as well as what it means to be an African-American in a post-colonial present. The book is well written and engaging and I recommend it whole-heartedly.
0385344333|3.0|Lee Child has written some really interesting novels in his Jack Reacher series...this is not one of them. Although the author has had a rather long and successful run with the Reacher character, it appears that there are limits to what he can wring out of one that is a wanderer with no long-term relationships, who has only temporary possessions, including his wardrobe. He wears new clothes for about three days and then discards them after purchasing another set. Hitchhiking is his means of transportation around the country, which somehow works for him. As anyone knows who has sampled this series, Jack Reacher is a very large man at 6'5'' and about 210-220 pounds. So, one might wonder who would give a ride to a guy that imposing. Nonetheless, in A Wanted Man, Reacher is in a really dull part of the country, the Great Corn Desert (as I term it) of Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas. I ought to know, being from central Illinois, another terminally boring area. What's even worse, the story unfolds during the winter when even the corn and bean fields are fallow. So, the land is featureless, the roads are built on a grid, including the Interstate highways that are traveled again and again as the focus of the story...what story there is...shifts from one uninteresting place to another. Reacher becomes a part of the plot when he is picked up along the Interstate by three people who are ostensibly on their way to Chicago. Jack is trying to make it to Virginia to check out a person of the female persuasion who, however, he has not met, only having spoken to her on the phone in a couple of novels back. I wish he would arrive there, since Virgina is a lot more interesting than is the heartland of the nation. Just read one of David Baldacci's novels that are placed there (for example, one of his King-Maxwell efforts). So, somehow, Reacher is stuck riding in whitebread vehicles, such as one or another Ford Crown Victoria that are apparently de rigueur for law enforcement types, along arrow-straight roads along which apparently the most exciting thing one can see is a set of roadside signs announcing another crossroads where one can find gas, grub, and/or generic lodging. There is not a lot of action in this novel until about three-quarters of the way through, so it was hard slogging to arrive at that point. That some action does occur is due to the seemingly improbable consequence of Reacher, as a retired MP and now civilian, being put to service by a pair of female FBI agents. This is not the first time he has become a sidekick to a law enforcement official, but it always seems to me to strain credulity that such is the case. I suppose, however, that if this did not occur, there would be not much of a story for Lee Child to tell. Although I have read every one of Lee Child's novels, I am having a difficult time remaining a fan. I am not really sure what the author can do to reclaim his mojo, but since he doesn't have much of a means to develop characters about which we can care and that we can follow from entry to entry in the series, then he had best get Reacher out of the Midwest and to some place where there is a bit of geographical variety. Perhaps it is just me, so it is possible that I just spent too many years growing up in this part of the country, before I got smart and moved to the southeast. So, I think, all things said, that I am going to give this novel 2.5 stars rounded up to 3. Oh, and by the way, I see some other reviewers are not happy with the plans for filmization of the series, so I can put my proverbial two cents worth in as well. Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher? Really? Seriously? Come on, Lee, do you really need the money that badly?
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was a nice, easy read.  Very fun, much like the show, Castle.  I recommend it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS, as always, has excellent story lines, which take the story in many directions, while keeping the same basic premise that each episode is generally about.
0525953728|4.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" was a easy read.  I enjoyed reading about what it takes to be a Navy SeAL without it exposing many details to our enemies.  I didn't feel there was anything classified in this book (so I don't know why some people think it is exposing too much information).  I feel that we need to know about the brave men that put their life on the line every day to protect our country (and don't ask for any recognition).  It is clear in this book that the dangerous missions that these men do all the time is just job to them.<br /><br />I am going to donote money to the Navy SEAL foundation because these men and the sacifices their families ensure deserve help from every American.  God Bless our troops!
B004T9R218|5.0|The concepts here are simple:  people don't earn money--money earns more money. Don't spend it, invest it!  DO YOUR HOMEWORK and educate yourself about investing, financing and bookkeeping.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|One of the greatest, twisted black comedies ever made. Absolute genius. Enjoy the master auteur at his finest and funniest.
B004EI2NM2|1.0|Written and directed by men, gee I'm shocked! Medem has made some interesting and sexy films, this film is neither. This movie wreaks of male fantasy. They seem to be under the impression that because two women are naked for the entire film and engaging in some creative sexual positioning, it's going to make a quality film. There are some scenes that pushed that aspect so much, you know Medem was saying right before they were shot \\"these women doing this will make me happy\\" when in fact it was two women going through the motions and making noises. I can say, as a lesbian, that it did nothing for me. I think I can speak for a lot of people when I say the movie is boring enough with two women, but if it was a straight couple in there, it wouldn't even have made it onto the IFC or any other channel for that matter. The music is atrocious by the way.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not my favorite in the series, but still a great read. i was satisfied with the ending  i think the author went in the right direction.
B009AQOZIS|4.0|I don't understand what the really bad reviews are all about. This album is actually really good. Its not quite Maiden or metal at all but still is really good. Instrumentation is quality as well as the vocals. THE BASS sounds awesome of course and the singer CAN sing very well. A few people wrote reviews complaining about the vocals which doesn't make since. He can sing better than a plethora of new and old vocalist. Also the album does have a few songs that could be mild maiden tracks like \\"the choosen ones\\". Great track and has heavy maiden type of structure. Without knowing Steve was on this I could guess there was heavy maiden influence mainly cause the bass line. THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM, WORTHY OF PURCHASE. In my opinion it has a very high re-listening value.
B007TML4EI|5.0|I've really enjoyed playing dummy defense - building a cheap structure to protect the dummy from myriad dangers provides a great challenge and often requires thinking outside of the box.  I've been well pleased with the game's ability to cope with creative solutions!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i could play this for hours. I'm always a sucker for this game at arcades so this is a much cheaper alternative!  :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I want to go to sleep. It is 2:25 in the morning and i have to get up at seven. Yet, here I am writing a review for this book instead of letting my weary bones rest. You may ask why am I putting myself in such a sleepless predicament. It certainly is not because I am masochist (though a little rough play never hurt anyone). I write this because I want to let you know that this book was so amazing that it caused my health to deteriorate slighly due to said lack of sleep.If you fear you might suffer similar health problems then I don't recommend you read this book because you won't be able to control your reading intake (trust me on this, I tried pacing myself but then gave up on my stict reading diet once I reached chapter five). The choice is simple, if you like sleep then do not buy this book. If you are an insomniac or have recently acquired a small infant containing half of your genetic material and it won't let you sleep at night so you end up staying up at night due to its excess crying yet you still want to enjoy reading a good book for those precious in between minutes of sweet silence, then go ahead and buy this book. Whatever you choose, I'm going to sleep so bye.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|cam gigandet what a great actor played as good as he did in twilight and never back down really like all of his movies
0345803485|1.0|I read this book, and I almost didn't get page 30.  I only kept reading because people told me I had to get further in the book to get to the good part.  If a book doesn't draw me in from the beginning, that's when my interest flies out of the winder, however, there is an Erotica Fiction novel titled Tempted by author Qiana Rae that is great.  You will be drawn in from the very 1st page!
1451629192|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I began reading this memoir. I imagined it would be too much to handle. I didn't really want to read about a diabolical degenerate who kept a girl as his sex slave, but I wanted to know how Jaycee Dugard was able to cope and survive. Despite having to endure so much suffering and torture, Dugard writes about her ordeals in a way that is surprising. Rather than shying away from her traumatic experiences, or glossing them over, she faces them directly. She bravely revisits these painful moments and admits no hatred for her tormentor, Phillip Garrido. In the book, Dugard admits to being shy and nearly equates her shyness with being &quot;weak&quot;. She repeatedly questions her constitution, wishing that she could have handled things better and wonders if she could have escaped when she had the opportunity. The only thing Dugard is guilty of is not giving herself enough credit. She is a remarkable person and as a writer, she's humble, honest, and comprehensive. Once she gets your attention, she'll keep it.
B007THA4FI|5.0|An enjoyable book. JK Rowling confirms that she is an entertaining story teller, this time telling a tale about a council in a small town.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Better than angry birds by far! I would definitely recommend this one since even my 4 year old loves it.

B008XG1X18|3.0|I live the app however every time I use it it locks up and I have to force close then when I try it again it sometimes still can't load.  Once that's fixed i'd totally adjust my rating.
B0072OFM28|5.0|We really enjoyed the second season once we adjusted to the new actor playing Spartacus and the emtreme blood and guts.  ( Actually I'll never adjust to that; I close my eyes when it looks really bad.)  The episodes were captivating, very well-written and produced.  The plays did a commendable job.  Looking forward to season iii.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This new app is a lot of fun and also very challenging, and my husband also very much likes to play it.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|I needed this special movie edition for the extras that provided additional historical background on the Apollo 13 incident.  It didn't have every thing I was looking for, but it did contribute towards the near-perfect score that I received on my final exam.
B002P77OZ0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Big Bang Theory episodes...watching how Sheldon tries to learn to be happy about his friend's success.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book that describe the SEAL career in the last 15 years.<br />No politic,just the best of the best of US Army and how committed are with their work.<br />Highly recommended.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Let me start by saying I consider Frank Miller's various works on Batman (including All-Star Batman & Robin) to be among the most definitive in the character's rich history. This is an excellent adaptation. Overall, the traumatized, angry, pissed-off aristocrat Batman is my favorite take on the character. But know what you're getting - this is Batman 10 years in the future, as an old man. Though the action sequences are great, this is not the Batman many are accustomed to.
B00933TZ4M|1.0|What a disappointment that what was a potentially intriguing plot was so x rated.  Why do so many private activities have to be included in this show?!<br />Not only that, it was very slow moving.  Homeland is horrible.
0525953728|5.0|wow. a great read. hated to put it down 'till it was finished. the inside workings of our military & our government was enlightening. the Seals did one hell of a job, as they always do.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this CD through Amazon.  Was I hoping to recapture the magic that was the Talking Head?  What I found was that David Byrne in this collaboration with St. Vincent has taken us on a journey that only he could lead.  Yes, there is a touch of the Talking Heads quirky magic here, but there is so much more.  I don't know a lot about how music gets put together, but it is worth a purchase and a listen to hear someone who really does.  You can enjoy this CD on a variety of levels and I feel that you will come away with an appreciation for just how clever and talented David Byrne is and continues to be.  I understand that he also has a book being publish about music, the music industry, and his part in it.  Sounds like two good companions to spend a little time with.
B007THA4FI|1.0|If this had been J.K. Rowling's first book, it probably would be the last to find a publisher.  The overall impression of the story is one of dismal hope, diminished opportunity, and downright mean people.  It doesn't help that the most likable person in the story is killed over in chapter one.<br /><br />Save your money.  Don't wait for the movie.  Go do something pleasant with those you love and make the world a better place.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|This movie simply had too many holes in the plot and was far too drawn out to earn the title of best movie in the current Batman series. Batman Begins was a much more compelling, well written, and far better film in my opinion.
B0011BDPXQ|5.0|Stargate rules!  I left a review for this episode because some people felt the need to give this episode 1 star.  I abhor the thought of a star being alone, it is my mission to uplift these starts to buddydom.
1401322786|4.0|I'm a fan of Mitch Albom and when I heard that he has release his new book. Of course, I order ASAP. The book in the beginning is a bit confusing of what is happening, but be patient and keep reading. It's  different in how he wrote this book but at the end of the novel Mitch Albom sums up how time is important to us and he explains even though we live our own life's we are still some how connected but we just don't know that.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Branagh's 'Hamlet' is the best among contemporary film versions. By producing the play unedited, with a brilliant cast of actors, Branagh presents the text with a clarity other directors often stifle, seemingly in attempts to somehow 'out do' Mr Shakespeare. But Branagh respects and understands the need for the entire play to evolve as it was written. His bravery in producing the full text reveals it is truly a flawless piece of writing that should not be edited for the sake of reducing its length. Edited versions do not have the same power or clarity. The relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia particularly, Hamlet's sense of humour, the fragility of his psyche and his intelligence are brought to life with renewed vigour - fully justified. If you love well produced and performed Shakespeare or if you are a teacher seeking a clear version of the play for young English text students and/or university students this film version cannot be beaten. I am grateful AMAZON stocks this DVD because for some reason, it is unavailable for hire in Australia. I've seen it many times but I decided to buy it for my DVD library. I will cherish it among my collection of favourite films.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|this is an amazing book filled with fantastic characters and a great plot. i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy.
0142000655|5.0|This is Steinbeck's unrecognized masterpiece. I've read some of Steinbeck's most celebrated novels and none of them even came close to this one.<br /><br />I have been in the sciences for some years now and have neglected reading novels. I was convinced to pick up this one by a friend who swore on his life that I would never regret reading every single page of this tome. He was definitely right. Despite my impatience and my harsh criticisms of most the novels I read, I found this one to be engrossing due to each character's fantastic description and roles they play in the story. Despite the fact that the copy I had was over 900 pages long, I found myself wishing it had never ended. The book stayed in my mind for weeks after I finished it. I have never had a novel impact me so much in my life and I will never forget it. Everything else I've read since then has just seemed like complete garbage.<br /><br />I look forward to the day when I have a copy on my bookshelf and my future child gets old enough to pull it down and read it. What a reward, what a gem.

B005LLSLPE|5.0|After watching the first 3 seasons on Netflix I had to continue my journey. I like all the characters on the show- they all bring something different. Clay want's to expand and make big money with the cartel. The originals are against drug dealing and makes way for an interesting season. Don't want to spoil too much, but my favorite season so far. Im new to Anarchy, but have watched 3 seasons in about a week. That's how good this show is.

1423165691|2.0|After such a long wait, this came as quite a letdown.<br /><br />The talent on display is incredible, that's a given with mostly any Disney behind-the-scenes art book, but the selection is so brief and indiscriminate for such a long history that it feels more like a sampler than the showcase book this should have been. That, combined with the lack of any artist's credit and no apparent criteria behind the selection, makes for a very weak effort.<br /><br />Certainly there are a few pages here and there that really stand out, but mostly is just of the 'meh' variety that makes you wonder why they chose that particular sketch instead of another one.<br /><br />Even at the $30 Amazon's price, this is a whim purchase that I can not justify or afford, so back to Amazon it goes.

I look forward to see what happens next to Katniss and if Peeta survies.
B0096RUN5A|5.0|I don't buy much music like this. I mostly listen to hard rock but this one had a catchy sound so I grabbed it. I'm not gonna go on and on here.  If you like call me maybe then buy it.

0307352145|5.0|A very interesting book about the power of introversion. You'll be surprised of how many introverts you know. I'm an introvert myself. Cain explains, in nontechnical terms, the difference between introversion and extroversion supported by studies done by psychologists, behaviorists, psychiatrists and others in the field. Cain also sheds light on why intro and extroverts behave they way they do such as why introverts need to recharge after a social gathering while extroverts need those gatherings to recharge? The studies cited in the book are very interesting and thought provoking conducted by well known scientists. It's not a self-help book ( I'm not big fan of this genre myself) but it provides some tips to what to expect when interacting with extros and intros. Nicely written and organized and very informative. I can't recommend it enough for people who have the slightest interest in the subject. Lots of \\"Aha!\\" moments too. Enjoy!

B0058Z4NR8|4.0|I've read almost all of this book at this point, and overall it's a fascinating, well-argued book.  As others have mentioned, it shows conclusively the importance of \\"inclusive\\" political and economic institutions, rather than \\"extractive\\" institutions, in fostering prosperity, and also demonstrates the critical relationship between political and economic institutions.<br /><br />However, there are some clear weaknesses.<br /><br />For one, their explanation of why particular nations adopt and sustain inclusive institutions and others don't is based on turning points and contingencies -- essentially, a \\"butterfly effect\\" theory with no predictive power, particularly in the long run.<br /><br />Also, their theories tend to fail when applied to the pre-modern era.  The last few hundred years have witnessed rapid technological developments and the global diffusion of technology, creating an extraordinary number of turning points and leveling out inherited technological disparities.  In the past, however, these inherited disparities often overwhelmed other factors, making it much harder to apply the inclusive vs. extractive theories.  As an example, the lagging behind of the US South vs. the North is said to be closely related to the slave-based (hence more extractive) economy of the South, which makes a good deal of sense -- yet Ancient Rome had a highly slave-based economy at all times.  As a result, the authors resort to saying that Rome had \\"relatively inclusive\\" institutions during the Republic, and it was the \\"more extractive\\" institutions of the Empire (e.g. the shift of power from Senate to Emperor) that caused its downfall.  It is true that Roman technological development seems to have peaked more or less around the time of the start of the Empire (44 BC), but inferring causation is far from obvious.  For example, the peak of Roman prosperity is often said to have been around 90 - 150 AD -- well after the start of the Empire -- and the authors also demonstratethat many of the problems that later became acute began already by 100 BC or so, and the change to an Empire was an *effect* of these problems, not their cause.  The end of large-scale expansion also occurred by about 0 AD.  The ultimate downfall of Rome may simply have been that its economic system was designed from the beginning to transfer wealth from the periphery to the center, which required continual expansion, which in turn could not be sustained beyond a certain size due to technological limitations that made it too difficult to manage such a large empire.<br /><br />Nonetheless, they don't seem to recognize these limitations, and spend a great deal of effort maligning alternative theories (e.g. Diamond's geographic theory) that may do a much better job explaining long-term and pre-modern disparities.  For example, I find completely laughable their claim that things \\"might have different\\" in the New World if the Incas had resisted the \\"threat\\" of the Spaniards and managed to \\"reform their institutions\\", supposedly like the Japanese did in the 1850's when confronted by the US.  They even hypothesized that the different outcomes might be due to the \\"more extractive institutions\\" of the Incas vs. the Japanese!  In reality, (a) as demonstrated by Diamond, the Incas had no prayer whatsoever of resisting the Spaniards, which had nothing to do with their institutions and everything to do with their enormous comparative technological inferiority; (b) the Japanese did *not* resist the US in the 1850's (the US got exactly what it wanted, which was favorable trade concessions), but merely survived -- which again had a lot to do with the fact that they already had enough development, esp. of military technology, to make invading a relatively unappealing prospect.  Diamond's geographic theory seems to me a strong explanation for why these technological disparities came about (and contrarily, is at its weakest trying to explain the history of the last 500 years).<br /><br />It is likewise the case that something like cultural explanations have a clear place in explaining certain facts.  E.g. if you take Acemoglu and Robinson (A+R)'s theory literally, it would essentially be a coincidence that not only Britain but also the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand all ended up with inclusive institutions and strong development.  But does anyone really believe this?  In this case it's obvious that the influence of Britain -- essentially a cultural influence -- led to these parallel developments exactly in the places that felt culturally most connected to Britain due to settlement patterns, but not anywhere else colonized by Britain (India, South Africa, etc.).  Cultural influences are even clearer when immigrant patterns are examined.  For example, some immigrants (e.g. Chinese and Jewish) seem to do well almost everywhere they go (e.g., in the U.S. better than the average American).  This is unlikely to be a coincidence.  A+R's closest attempt at discussing this issue is w.r.t. Israel vs. other Middle East countries, where they vaguely assert that Israel's success is due to the \\"increased educational opportunities and greater access to technology\\" of the Ashkenazi immigrants from Europe -- but this explicitly contradicts A+R's repudiation of the \\"ignorance theory\\", i.e. that the problems of poor countries are due to lack of access to knowledge about better institutions and technologies. Furthermore, it's far from obvious that typical Chinese immigrants, esp. pre-1978, had any sort of \\"increased educational opportunities and greater access to technology\\".  It seems far more likely that the success is really due to cultural norms stressing the importance of education, of group coherence for mutual betterment, etc.  It is certainly possible to argue that stable institutions tend to lead to cultural norms favoring cooperation and group coherence, and vice-versa -- but this is an indirect argument, and there are plenty of counterexamples in both directions.

B009HXG9UQ|3.0|More abstract and more reserved than Anderson's other films, which are usually accessible and which usually contain elements of pop culture.  This one just aspires to be art, and in particular aspires to be Godard's \\"Pierrot Le Fou\\".  It imitates that film heavily, but with kids as the fatalistic couple rather than adults.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Listening to lost but found gems throughout \\"Release Me\\", many will once again realize why they first fell in love with the incomparable voice of Barbra Streisand, the ultimate Diva who can turn any song inside out in her own unique and completely thrilling way...down to the depths then soaring off to exhilarating heights, this full of variety collection is an instant classic!  Great opener \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\" is the perfect passionately sung opener for this great mix of tremendous performances, originally slated as lead song for \\"The Broadway Album\\" more than two decades ago, message of being best works all these years later to open this peerless collection of mesmerizing performances...standouts abound, each and every brilliant song is developed with loving care to its fullest potential, tender songs like \\"Willow Weep For Me\\", \\"Try To Win A Friend\\", \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" and \\"Mother And Child\\" are soulfully sung with depth and sensitivity that is rare, ultimately deeply moving to experience with that special touch of magic, then on to raise the roof to the rafters \\"Home\\" that for certain is a fantastic finale to a satisfying collection of stellar performances! Sadly with current state of superficiality today in the world of music, looks like greatness like this might never happen again so enjoy, happily Barbra Streisand is still in glorious form as newly recorded \\"If It's Meant To Be\\" show, it is meant to be this wondrous talented lady is still out there singing her heart & soul out for those who still care & want the magical musical journey going on as long as possible, long live Barbra & thank you for this timeless musical treasure!

B009GEBBNQ|1.0|Unfortunately, Marvel may have been robbed with the production of this film. Much like the X-Men trilogy, this movie did not follow the comics at all, other than the names. They went with popularity of the names instead of story and covered it up with the \\"Yawn, I have seen this a thousand times\\" eye-popping special effects. I was not impressed.

It's an awesome effin movie that's \\"so what!\\" It's great. And by great I mean \\"pretty good\\" SRSLY dough, it's excellent. We needs SPF's (i'm doin my own abbreviations and ackronyms like Tom on \\"Parks and Rec\\") and a commentary, dat cagy old man Beatty needs to pick up his wrinkly-we need a special edition. \\"Steel\\" is a Warner Direct dvd.

B0089BSM70|5.0|Like Joe Pesci says (paraphrase) in Lethal Weapon 2: \\"they eff you with the deluxe edition, they eff you with the retrospective documentaries on movies that nobody really holds in high regard!\\" They do, ya know. They really do. This one is particularly cringe worthy as only an idiot actor and the director's wife (who actually gives a succinct appreciation) defend it in the end. wtf? It's an excellent studio sequel. And Halloween, as great as it is, as much as i really love it-isn't The Rules of The Game people, it's a freakin movie about a force of evil that stabs hot young babysitters? There's a shameless nude scene and the only reason there's so little gore is because they didn't have the budget for it (that's not the only reason but it was still a real one). It's not perfect. Get over it. All the other features are excellent, the commentaries are good and the image quality is superb. Buy it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Disclaimer...everything I write concerns the first three movies, not Crystal Skull.<br />This is one the best action/adventure series ever filmed and there can't be many people who disagree with me. It's adrenaline pumped, wall to wall action and had been on my blu-ray bucket list for some time now. I am so glad there weren't any \\"alterations\\" ala Star Wars because they were perfect as they were.<br />Hariison Ford in his heyday was unstoppable and even as most trilogies suffer by the last one, The Last Crusade was the best of the group. Sean Connery;s interplay with Indy was classic. The storyline merged both historical scenery with mythological/religious undertones without stuffing it down your throat.<br />Even if you own this on DVD, get the blu-ray anyway. Support good movies.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Anybody holding back from reading this book based on the \\"Harry Potter\\" books should rest easy. They are NOTHING alike!<br />Rowling sure displayed her writing chops with this new book, well worth the wait. You will start reading and find yourself immersed in a small English town, where seemingly un-related events are more related than you realize.<br />Rowling gave an interview in which she stated that she wouldn't want to talk with anyone who hadn't cried at the end of the book. I did...and you will too. I wouldn't have anything to talk about with the person who wasn't so moved by this book either.
034552554X|2.0|The book started out as a can't put it down type of read, really enjoyable quick moving story of overcoming a difficult background, finding love and starting a new successful life. The utilization of flowers was fascinating. Suddenly, about the middle of the book (about the time she has a child), the author drops the ball. It becomes slow moving, boring and not believable, a force myself to finish it, \\"oh come on now, there is no way that would happen\\" type of story. I would give 4 stars for the first half and one star for the last half of the book.

0132350882|5.0|What is clean code you might ask? One of the definitions that most resonated with me is that of Grady Booch, author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications: \\"Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer's intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.\\"<br /><br />The main premise of the book, as stated by the author, is: \\"learning code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those decisions the wrong way.\\"<br /><br />The book is made up of three sections: The first one outlines the \\"principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code\\". This includes topics such as naming, functions, comments, formatting etc. The second one, includes several working examples of code cleanup using the tools from the first section. The last section, includes a number of heuristics and smells that help identify the need for cleaning code. These smells are divided by area, such as environment, names, comments etc.<br /><br />What sets this book apart is the applicability, practicality and breadth of the concepts discussed. The last section of the book is of particular relevance as a starting point for identifying weaknesses or deficiencies in code. These then serve as a testing ground for applying the concepts introduced in the book. What the author stresses throughout his work, is the need to continuous practice and to clean the code in an iterative manner.<br /><br />A recommended read for anyone involved with the software development lifecycle regardless of experience. From a critical standpoint, the choice of some of the case study code bases was at times questionable given its abstraction. This made them hard to follow at times.able given its abstraction. This made them hard to follow at times.

0316228532|5.0|Full disclosure: I adore J. K. Rowling. I worship her as a literary goddess, as a muse nonpareil. I think she is one of the greatest storytellers in human history and a superb writer to boot (not the greatest writer, though: in my estimation, that honor belongs to both William Shakespeare and Fyodor Dostoevsky). Thus, my review of The Casual Vacancy may not be completely unbiased.<br /><br />Now, having heaped such great praise upon Rowling, I was still, I must admit, a bit unsure about her venture into a totally different genre. I was quite certain that I would like her new book, for I am fully acquainted with her skill at spinning tales, but I was afraid that there would be something--some of the glorious enchantment--from the Harry Potter novels that would not translate into The Casual Vacancy. I was wrong: The Casual Vacancy is, in its own way, on par with the Harry Potter novels in terms of plot and narrative; a direct comparison, though, cannot really be made as it would be like comparing apples to oranges.<br /><br />For the fan of great fiction, regardless of the genre, The Casual Vacancy, will not disappoint. As the novel progressed, I grew more and more engrossed, more and more captured by Rowling's marvelous ability to create genuine characters, which is ability all too rare. The characters in The Casual Vacancy are not perfect (and even Harry Potter and Dumbledore had their failings); they all have their own respective strengths and personal shortcomings. At times, we love them, and at times, we are reviled by them. There are no simplistic characters who are either heroes or villains, saints or sinners. And, of course, this is life as we encounter it.<br /><br />Beyond her fabulous portrayal of the characters are the intertwining stories that link them all together. In the first chapter, we meet Barry Fairbrother, who promptly suffers an aneurysm and dies. Barry had been a member of the Pagford Parish Council, where he had made some friends and some enemies. Barry was also very well liked in the community, where he had many friends outside the Council. Barry's friends and foes and their children are the focus of the story: this is a story of small-town politics, unhappy marriages and relationships, class conflict, parents and children, self discovery, coming of age, and teenage angst. Rowling weaves many tiny yet significant threads of interdependent narratives all together into a beautiful tapestry of love and hate, lust and jealousy, violence and drug addiction, bullying and friendship, loss and redemption.<br /><br />For the first 100 pages of this novel (which comes in at 503 pages total), Rowling sets the table, and these first 100 pages are great but possibly might seem a bit slow to some; however, thereafter, the novel launches and becomes completely riveting. I could not turn the pages quickly enough. Rowling is a master at plotting and pace, and she is even more brilliant building suspense and springing surprise.<br /><br />One caveat: this not Rowling writing for young adults. The Casual Vacancy is an adult novel with adult language and adult themes (domestic violence, drug abuse, death, cutting, bullying, sex). Many readers might be a bit shocked at the language or the portrayals of the grimness, griminess, and darkness of real life in this novel, but Rowling is giving us a story about real people living real lives, and so she is honest to her characters.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully told story with characters that you will love and hate and an ending that, though not entirely unforeseeable, is still surprising yet appropriate and satisfying. I very highly recommend The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />Bravo, Jo! Bravo!<br /><br />* * * * * * * * *<br /><br />****MINOR SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />I have seen The Casual Vacancy described in some reviews as a dark comedy. While it is definitely dark, it is in no sense a comedy, not even a dark comedy. Though it does not rise to the level of Shakespearean tragedy, it most definitely is a tragedy.agedy, it most definitely is a tragedy.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very disappointing...after enjoying all the Harry Potter series and the wonderful imagination that went into her writing, Casual Vacancy was hard to get into, had characters that were so uninteresting and all worried by SO many issues, there was hardly a likable one in the book.

B00000JLWW|5.0|The greatist movies of all time are, The Godfather, Raging Bull, and The Shawshank Redemption, but this is the one that made me feel the most sad depressed and above all loved, sure there have been TONS of titanic movies before this one, but this is the first one where everything that's true about the story is put into full effect, and the fictional side to the story is what keep's the movie from getting board for 3 hours, Lionardo Dicaprio is very captivating in the role as jack, and Kate Winslet is also very charming and loveable, the music by james honer is what holds the movie together, it's haunting, amussing, and emotionly painfull, and this version of the movie is by far the best one beacuse we dont need to flip/go to a 2cd disc to watch the whole movie, unlike every other dvd realese which just does it for specile feature's, that's fine to have them, but just put them all on there own disc's, the only feature on this one is just the trailer, but to me, that's the only feature required on a dvd, which most newer movies lack very much, unless you bought the Blu-Ray of this already, i say stick with the original realese, it's the better version overall

B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Halfbrick studio created an awesome game, but it's a little glitchy. I bought a lot of gadgets, then it said I didn't by it and then it would speed up. It made it a lot harder and not as fun. Good game though. I just think this should be fixed. I love a good bargain, but this should be fixed.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It loads quickly.  Fast searching.  The format is very user friendly.  The photos of the items up for bid are clear, details can be seen :)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game, much longer than I expected.  Probably got about 6 hours of game play and only had to use the hint a few times.  If you like the Mystery Case Files games you will like this game.  Lots of hidden object scenes and a fair amount of puzzles.  Graphics are great, easy to zoom in.  Looking forward to the next game.
0446547646|3.0|I have read most of what Nicholas has written.  Despite the predictability of the books (i.e. geography, romantic conflict and tragic endings) I find myself looking forward to each new effort.  I also follow the author on Facebook.<br /><br />'The Best of Me' does not journey far from the aforementioned predictability, yet, too, I found the story engaging and enjoyable.  However, I did not read this book.  Rather, I listened to it on audio CD.  Herein lies the minor disconnect with this reviewer.<br /><br />When one reads, the way information is processed is kind of like listening to a well scripted commercial on the radio.  The 'theater of the mind' takes over and one's imagination simply fills in the interpretive blanks.  The narrator Sean Pratt did a fine job voicing both first and third person dialogue.  However, I imagined myself reading the story instead of listening to it.  With the former I felt that the relationship between well-to-do main character Amanda Collier and gas station owner Tuck was a stretch, but plausible. Again, it's my mind interpreting the written word. As an audio CD the vocal characterization of Tuck seemed too far removed from the world in which Amanda lived to resonate true to me.  There was nothing for my imagination around which to wrap itself.<br /><br />Briefly, this disconnect made be feel removed from the developing story line between Amanda and her paramour Dawson Cole - someone from the 'wrong' side of the tracks.  Nevertheless, the writer does an admirable job of connecting the touch points of these two principal characters.  In time, even the role of Tuck reveals a more realistic pivot point on which the story turns.

B0035G04TI|5.0|After hearing the author's counsel  about this book, I was so impressed I determined it would make a perfect wedding gift. The binding appears very expensive.  The lucky couple will be pleased I am sure, and it should be an asset in beginning their lives together.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a very compelling novel with a new twist every chapter.  It keeps you guessing right up until the end.  I couldn't put it down or stop trying to figure out what would happen next!  The characters are complex and interesting.  I would recommend this book for a good escape read.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Looking at Mikes Physic I was interested in reading his Book. What makes this book an excellent read. Well to start off with Mike covers all the necessary Scientific stuff about Body Building and Nutrition which is easy to read and not to long winded. Let's face it, it's good to know but I wanted the Workouts, as we all do. The Ah Ah moment in the Book was to realise that utilising more Compound exercises will also help develop your other Muscles, so once you understand that you don't have to do every conceivable exercise in the book, plus you spend less time at the Gym. Since implementing Mike workouts I have experienced a greater overload to my body which has certainly hardened me up. Mikes workout is simpler and works your body harder for less time, now all I got to do is concentrate on the diet. Well worth the money.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|The sophomore album from M&S is entertaining and a good listen. Not as entertaining as their original album but quality none the less.
B007USWCXS|4.0|This is another excellent offering from filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki. \\"Le Havre\\" from 2011, is Kaurismaki's second French-language feature, and it's a rare treat in this day and age. With an excellent cast: Andre Wilms, Kati Outinen, the great Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Elina Salo, Blondin Miguel, Evelyne Didi, etc. 'Marcel Marx' (Andre Wilms) is an ex-bohemian artist, who now makes a living as a shoe-shiner in the central-station and byways of the Atlantic port of Le Havre. When his wife 'Arletty' (Kati Outinen) falls ill, she is taken to the hospital where her diagnosis is feared for the worse. Then 'Marcel' while on his usual route and during a lunch-break, comes across 'Idrissa', a poor but intelligent runaway immigrant-boy from Africa. Who was smuggled: along with others on a cargo vessel. From this moment on 'Marcel's' life will never be the same!<br /><br />This film is once again proof that there are still truly humanitarian-artists around, making profound statements about the social conditions in the world today. Mr. Kaurismaki and his fellow artists are such people! I don't want to give anything away, but this film is a perfect example of the very Christic meaning of \\"do unto others, as you would have them do unto you\\". Simply superb and heartwarming, done in the unique style of this marvelous auteur! Please, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. French (English subtitles), NTSC, NR 93 mins. (BTW: Please ignore the comments of the reviewers who missed the point here!)<br /><br />Love and Peace,<br />Carlos Romero
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I honestly couldn't believe why people would give this movie such a bad score. Yea, it could have been better. But as every Sci-Fi fan knows, you get what you get. The visuals were awesome. The story could have been better as to why they were there in the first place. Something not funded by a major corporation by someone who was looking for his own personal fountain of youth. Oh this may contain **spoilers** by the way, but if you're reading this, then you may have already watched it.<br /><br />The movie is good, above average in my opinion from having watched Alien and Aliens. I know that this story ties into that same universe, albeit something new. The bottom line is, it could have been better; but it's Sci-Fi. As I said earlier, you get what you get! I gave it 3-stars for a couple reasons. 1) It was entertaining. 2) It deserved it. As plain as that.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Without doubt one of the very best games available! Hours of fun pick up and play, using ball boosts in different ways gives total replay value even after a huge choice of courses.
B000NQRE1E|3.0|the only issue i had was the digital copy was only in iTunes,  and I do not like that I was forced to using Apple services instead of either Windows copy ir iTunes.  Major letdown!! Wish they had an Ultraviolet copy of the film,  but I read that they don't have rights to this particular movie from Paramount, even though I heard that Paramount recently acquired rights for their films.. Really? What with 2 parts to the DVD. When I got the original DVD when it came out, it was only one disc. What gives? Other than those gripes, the film was really good quality for a Blu-Ray disc. Would give it 4 stars if it had Ultraviolet, but I guess you can't have everything you want...
B005LZW8FO|1.0|The premise of the trailer is that this is another \\"Contact\\" but not to be, just a wasted premise. The movie would be fine if it had nothing to do with a duplicate earth because as you watch it (or at least in my opinion) the twin earth has absolutely nothing to do with the story. What a waste of a great premise. If you wonder why this flopped at the box office it is because the movie is  bait and switch.
0525953728|5.0|The book reads like a movie. Opening with the approach to the compound and the possible blawk hawk crash. Then flashing back to the author's training days, which I found very interesting. The story then builds to the eventual mission, and picks up where it left off in the beginning. What I found interesting was his focus on the female analyst who had hounded Bin Ladin for 6 years, and her actual emotional response to seeing his body in the aircraft hangar. Based on what this book describes - these guys don't miss. I'm glad they're on our side. It will be interesting to see how Kathryn Bigelow's upcoming ZERO DARK THIRTY compares to this book.
B0000A2I1B|5.0|The line-up of musicians was about to undergo broad, important changes. This record encapsulates the \\"classic\\" line-up of the Santana Band taking it as far as they could go together. It is true, as someone else posted, that this record requires some effort by the listener, to be fully appreciated. But this record gives a lot in return. It provides the transition from the original, hard-rockin' Santana, and the more jazz-influenced version that prevailed for many years.
B008RYN44U|2.0|I get that bands evolve, I'm more than fine with that.  But as others have said, this sounds more like Gwen Stefani's solo work than it does other No Doubt albums.  I know it's not 1995 anymore, the fact that 1999 was 13 years ago is something I'm struggling to come to terms with, but that doesn't mean I can't/shouldn't expect a No Doubt album to have a similar sound to their past albums.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The Avenger's Four Disc Combo Pack came in a small amazon brown box. I preordered it for $20 and it was too good of a deal to pass up. This would normally cost around $40-$50. The box came alittle beat up. But everything inside worked fine so I cant complain. I see now that the price now is around $35 for the combo pack. Im so glad that I preordered it. This is a must have for any Marvel fan.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I was very pleased with the quality of the videos. Great app! Would highly recommend this download for both content and features.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|I'm glad Joe finally put out another solo endeavor.  Like many other musicians his age there is lot of introspection but I think that is a good thing.  There may be a little too much Jeff Lynn influence for my taste but overall I think it's good music and it has found a place in my music collection.  I would recommend this to any Walsh fan.
B001NLKT60|5.0|If you read the first book: The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo, you know that sometimes the story goes to different characters without a mention of the change.  This book does the same.  After I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  I just couldn't put it down.  I would use up all of the battery on my KINDLE reading.  Then I would charge my battery overnite and start reading again in the morning.

B0098WWEH8|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album. I purchased Veckatimest when it came out, and I thought it was decent - fairly experimental and adventurous in its way. Shields is a different thing entirely. It is much more listenable, and you can tell the band has worked these songs over with great attention to detail. The sound is very layered with different instruments weaving in and out. Song composition is complex, and holds up to repeated listening.<br /><br />Clearly, I don't write a review like a music critic. But I count myself a discerning listener. The only thing that I think could have used some work is the engineering on the album - the sound is a little muddy for my taste, and sounds like it was done on tape (maybe it was). In any case, this thing deserves 5 stars, and walks away with album of the year in my book.
1451662432|4.0|What an autobiography! There is so much in this book that on the face of it is admirable and interesting.  Young boy in post WWII Austria dreams big while enduring the devastation left by the war. The big dreams take him to the world of body building and then America. The man has innate sense of how to reach the dream through accumulating real estate holdings while promoting his greatest asset namely himself. He becomes an action hero movie star of huge proportion, cashes in on the movies and all those promotional deals that sound a resounding CA-CHING, marries into an American dynasty, and even gets to play governor of one of the most populated states in the country, The guy with the slightly odd sounding name has arrived and continues to ride the crest of the wave known as success. This story will appeal to anyone who believes in the American dream or any dream. There is a lot to admire about this man and I say that honestly. He is also painfully honest, to the extent that he is infuriating.<br />In TOTAL RECALL: MY UNBELIEVABLY TRUE LIFE STORY, Arnie really tells everything. If he has squirreled away anything not to be seen by the book reading public it may very well be a humdinger. However, on the face of it he has enough in this book to get people to buy this book. There is a ton of sex in this book. He admits he's been a bad boy when it comes to fidelity pre and post marrying his wife Maria. He gives meaning to his post love child scandal nickname The Sperminator. With all the action going on you can't help wondering how many gapped toothed kids are waiting to be discovered as an Arnie love child.<br />Still, despite the less than admirable revelations in this book that might indicate that the sensitivity gene is lacking, Arnie continues to praise his now estranged wife and continues to believe there will someday be a reconciliation. As for the Kennedys, he is effusive in his praise for his in-laws and the huge extended family. If you are hoping to get some less than flattering insights don't expect them in this book. Arnie gives it up when it comes to himself, but is downright respectful when it comes down to the Shrivers and Kennedys.<br />That he loves his children is a given. Never once did I get the idea that he wasn't a good father despite the fact that he wasn't always the best husband.<br />I don't live in California so I have no idea if he was an effective governor, but I don't think anyone can doubt that he is one heck of an entrepreneur and business.<br />This is an interesting story that moves quickly and has plenty of  OMG moments. It delivers what it has promised, but with all of his money it does beg the question why anyone would do this least of all Arnold.ss than flattering insights don't expect them in this book.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|MIDNIGHT IN PARIS is not for dummies. It's a pleasure to watch a film that's written with the assumption that the audience is intelligent enough to understand the references and get the jokes without having to dumb it down to the lowest common denominator. Mind you, I did have to look up a couple of the featured characters, but when is the last time a movie challenged your curiosity enough to bother? Owen Wilson is great in the traditional role of Woody's surrogate and the supporting cast is spot on. Watch the crowds in the party scenes for characters you'll recognize. My favorite Woody Allen film. My single complaint is that there's no director's commentary.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Better than the first book. I could not put it down, there was so much more action and secrets that were brought up. Cannot wait to start book three! <br /><br />.

B0001ZWN4K|4.0|Frankenstein, 1931 film<br /><br />This 'Revised Version' film begins with a burial. The grave is filled in. Two men dig up the coffin in the now empty graveyard. Then they cut down a hanged man; but this body is useless. A medical school compares the brains of an intelligent man to a foul criminal. Will the servant pick the right brain for Dr. Henry Frankenstein? Is he testing the boundaries of science and sanity? Frankenstein's fiancee worries about Henry. His teacher Dr. Waldman explains the problem with Henry - he wants to experiment on humans! Is this excessive optimism of megalomania? [There is no explanation why a new brain is needed for a body. Unless its for dramatic purposes.] The visitors arrive unexpectedly. \\"Crazy am I? We'll see tonight.\\" Frankenstein discovered a new ray that gives life! The storm will generate enough electricity to power the experiment. \\"Its alive!\\"<br /><br />Herr Vogel the Burgomeister visits Baron Frankenstein to ask about the scheduled marriage. Why is Henry waiting? The teacher warns Henry about what can happen. The monster makes a dramatic entrance. [They used short sleeves to suggest extra long arms.] The monster has a fear of flames. Fritz teases the monster one time too many. The plan to kill the monster fails. Dr. Waldman's plan to terminate the monster fails. So now the monster runs loose! Meanwhile the preparations for the marriage creates happiness in the village. Young Maria meets the monster, things go terribly wrong! Henry's bride has a premonition that something will go wrong. The monster is near. Maria's father asks for justice. The villagers go out to search for the monster. [They are not armed! How will they stop the monster?] Herr Frankenstein finds the monster. Will the villagers get there in time? The monster seeks refuge in an old windmill. The villagers add lighting. [The unnamed actor gives life to the monster's death.] There seems to be a happy ending for the Frankensteins.<br /><br />The story of a man-made monster terrorizing the country must have resonated with people during the Great Depression. A number of sequels were filmed with other monsters: vampires and werewolves. These filme ended by 1945. Future horror films would use other creatures.<br /><br />Bride of Frankenstein, 1935 film<br /><br />It was a dark and stormy night. Inside the castle two men and a woman watch the storm. They discuss the novel \\"Frankenstein\\", and Mary continues the story after the death of Frankenstein and his monster. [Those Mittel-Europeans all speak with an Englischer accent.] The monster survived the fire in the water beneath the mill. And so did Henry Frankenstein, along with his strange ideas. Dr. Pretorius arrives at night to see Henry with important news about his creations. He has created tiny humans from seeds (trick photography). Can they produce a brave new world of manufactured beings? The monster roams the hills and scares a shepherdess. Two men shoot to scare him away. The villagers gather to capture the monster alive, and chain him in the old dungeon. But the monster can't be held in prison, he escaped to the forest.<br /><br />The monster meets a blind hermit in a cabin. He learns to smoke. \\"Smoking is good!\\" Music charms the monster. But two visitors upset things. Grave robbers find a likely subject for Dr. Pretorius, who now wants Frankenstein to work on his next project. The monster carries off the Baroness Frankenstein, the Baron must cooperate with Pretorius. They ask Karl to find a young woman who died in an accident. The monster learns to drink. A rising storm will provide the electric power to raise the dead. The test subject is raised towards the heavens and lightning. \\"She's alive!\\" But things don't go as planned, there is a glitch in human nature. The Frankensteins survive the destruction of the tower. Will this be the end of these monster films?
B007STBUIW|4.0|I saw Jaws when it first came out in the 70s. I was but a schoolboy, and after that day, I never stopped drawing sharks on every piece of paper I could find. It's great to see one of my most loved films restored beautifully on Blu-ray. I can finally see the patterns and the textures on Mayor Larry's jacket, the sun-beaten craggly features on Quint's face, and all the details on Bruce the shark. I wonder how the young generation today, those who grew up with only CGI, will take to Bruce and this film.

I would recommend this book to anyone, who likes thrillers. I read it so fast, I couldn't put it down. It was that exciting!!! There was only one moment in the book, a crime scene, that may seem too \\"real or vivid\\" to some readers. I think Jo Nesbo is a very talented, focused, and elaborate constructor of plots!

B008MZPVP4|5.0|Down IV Part 1: The Purple EP is the upcoming EP to be released by metal supergroup Down, and is the first material to surface in five years since the release of Down III: Over The Under. Down IV Part 1 will be released on September 17, 2012 via Roadrunner Records. It is 6 tracks long and clocks in at 33 minutes in total length.<br /><br />Down IV Part 1: The Purple EP is the first release to feature new bassist Pat Bruders (who also plays in Crowbar), following Rex Brown's departure in 2011, to focus on his new project Kill Devil Hill. Other than the changing of members of the low-end, the Down line-up remains the same.<br /><br />Considering that we have had no new Down material within 5 years, this EP has been a long time coming. Estimated to for the new material to be spread out over four EPs, eventually making up Down IV as a whole, The Purple EP is the first of four expected EPs to be released over the year. We can only wait.<br /><br />Over these 6 six songs, there is an intensity that only Down can put out with any release, and it feels to me as if I'm greeting a long-time friend who I've not seen for a while. Pat Bruders seems to slot in just perfectly, having already played in Crowbar for a number of years alongside Kirk Windstein, and here mainly thanks to the production work his bass can be heard perfectly on the song. Speaking of production here it seems that Down have tried to go a bit 'old-school' in terms of production by giving it a more sludgier sound, instead of a clean and polished album, and it has been said that they tried to go back to the days of their first album, NOLA, of how they did things.<br /><br />These 6 songs only represents a fraction of the new material that is heading our way, but we obviously don't know when. The EP begins with 'Levitation' which has a short intro of the instruments jamming along and it seems like they are all having a good time, obviously Phil's vocals have not made their appearance yet. After a minute or so ofjamming, the instruments colliding and fusing to make up the new sound of Down which sounds no different to the sound heard on 2007's Down III, Phil's vocal cut through like a knife and bring the song to its full potential, everyone here standing out (even the newest member Pat) and Phil here is sound better than he has done for years, though not as good as his Pantera days.<br /><br />Next up is the lead single 'Witchtripper' which you've probably heard by now, and it begins with a short pinched guitar note before the song really kicks in.Down here seem to have really been working on the material a long time, going as far back as October 2011. It's sludgy, groovy and the guitar work is technically sound, though you'd least expect that when you have axemen like Pepper and Kirk on guitars -- or at least, what did you expect!? Thanks to the Billboard.com exclusive first listen I heard the EP in its full glory and I don't know about you, but I couldn't go and download the single -- for me, I needed to hear the EP fully, one track after another. Phil's voice again here is unique but also sounding a little different, he uses different timbres to enhance certain parts throughout the song -- his voice going down to a deeper tone; whilst Jimmy on the drums is as tight as ever.<br /><br />Next up, the EP's third track -- and my favourite so far, because of its meaning -- is 'Open Coffins'. It begins with Phil counting it before the song fully kicks in, with a sort of laid-back beat to this song but still it remains wholly Down. Whilst Phil's voice remains only Phil's, here it sounds as if he is trying to utilize his voice in a different way, though I'm not sure how -- singing differently, maybe using a higher/lower toning, but to me it sounds fantastic. Halfway through the song breakdowns which leaves more room for improvisation and interpretation, and here you hear some faint shredding from the guitars, both Pepper and Kirk, whilst this is more rhythmic patterns from Jimmy. Also, something I just noticed, just before the chorus kicks you can hear Phil singing: \\"We wear our heart on our sleeve.\\" Which I really like as it's saying: \\"We are who are, take us for that or go away!\\"<br /><br />The fourth track, 'The Curse is a Lie', didn't really stand out to me at first meaning that I didn't pay much attention to it, so that's my bad. Revisiting the EP on my second listen this is definitely a track that is standing out more, which starts off with some really spooky sounding guitar notes, building tension. I really like how this starts off with just the guitar, as it's not just 'in your face' but also demonstrates that these guys can play. This song is not as sludgier as the rest of the EP, but it's more laid back and groovier song, and it's more somber than anything, and there is a utilization of space within this song -- what I mean is that the guitars are not just playing rhythms, but rather come in here and there with a strong power chord with a few notes before exiting out again. The drums are right, the bass is thunderous, and most of all Phil's voice is right in your face. Again this floats by without me noticing so it will probably take a few more listens, other than that a good song.<br /><br />The fifth track, 'This Work is Timeless' mainly speaks about leaving a legacy behind after they die, work such as Pantera, Crowbar, Kingdom of Sorrow Corrosion of Conformity, EyeHateGod and not least of all: Down. This starts off with a count-in from Jimmy and then song fully kicks in, but has a little interplay between the band as they jam the song out. Again, Phil is trying out new things with his voice in this EP it seems as his voice kicks in and is sounding very different from the previous song, and perhaps it's trying to make the songs sound different and unique. The song's lyrics go like this at the beginning: \\"When You Return / Expect Concern / Live Through The High / And The Lower\\". This song is sludy, groovy and heavy - it has everything Down about it, but halfway through breaks down for some duo guitar work -- fantastic!<br /><br />The sixth and last song, 'Misfortune Teller', could be found on YouTube when Down debuted it in their live set. Here it differs to the live performance, and starts off with a pinched guitar note before the sludgy groove kicks in. This is my second favourite off of the EP purely because it's what I call a 'head-nodder' -- it makes you nod your head, just listen to it! A little deceptive with the length of 9 minutes, whereas the song only lasts 7 minutes and then the rest of the song is silence only until the song fades in again at 8:38 to introduce perhaps the start of Down IV Part 2 perhaps? Anyways, 'Misfortune Teller' is a groovy, sludgy song and it ends the EP on on a high note, though there is a guitar solo halfway through as well.<br /><br />Overall, Down IV Part 1 is only a taste of the new Down that will be coming our way (though obviously uncertain of when), but here only positive signs can be taken -- Pat Bruders, the newest member, slots in perfectly and it feels as Rex left on amicable terms, rather than leave in hostile terms. The 6 songs featured here are slices of sludginess from the New Orleans supergroup and I'm sure that fans of Down, or just metal fans in general, with soak this up with aplomb; only added to the fact Down being signed to Roadrunner Records/Warner, so it will distribute well. If you know Down and what they're about -- then you'll surely get this. If not when September 17 (or 18) comes, then pick it up.<br /><br />Rating: 5 / 5

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I have no interest in ever watching the theatrical cut of this movie again.  For me this is a huge statement.  I've been a fan of the film since I first watched it in 1998.  In Dark City, Proyas creates something special and memorable.  Dark City manages to simultaneously cultivate feelings of film noir, science fiction, horror, and thriller.<br /><br />Dark City's cast is amazing: performances by Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt are dry, depressing, and spot on.  Dark City is also one of the best written science fiction movies from the late 90's.  Every evening the city is reconfigured from below, and the pale men send out Dr. Daniel Schreber (Sutherland) to modify the thoughts and actions of its inhabitants--experimenting on the population by turning them into different people daily.  John Murdoch (Sewell) breaks the cycle by waking up mid cycle and remaining awake every evening.  Proyas leaves the viewer with questions regarding the location and purpose of the city, the strange nature of the machinery below the city, the terrible machinations of the ghoulish pale men who haunt the city at night, and the role that Murdoch will inevitably play.<br /><br />In many instances I've watched \\"directors cuts\\" of movies only to be disappointed.  In many instances these expanded cuts add additional scenes that were worthy of being cut, or simply substitute more violent cuts of action sequences that didn't make the theatrical version.  In some of those rare instances ([[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner]]), a proper choice of cut can absolutely make the movie.<br /><br />What's so special about the director's cut of Dark City?  Everything.  In the theatrical version Sutherland's character lays all of the cards on the table, providing a narration that simultaneously setting up the plot for the film and treating the viewer as if they were to stupid to figure things out as the movie progresses.  Where the narration once weighed heavily on the feelingof the intro, the movie starts out with a much more ominous feel.  Sutherland's doctor now trudges silently down the street after performing his terrible work.  Most of the additional 10-15 minutes added back to the film doesn't constitute new scenes, but expands upon what was already there.  The differences are subtle--you may need a side by side comparison to notice them, however you don't need to locate exactly what was extended in order to appreciate the difference.  As for the blu-ray version, the transfer is spectacular.  The picture and sound are absolutely crystal clear and stunning.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the original I would highly recommend that you pick up the Director's cut on blu-ray.
B007TK77QE|2.0|In her iconic Harry Potter series, Rowling had even hard core, no-nonsense, no- fantasy readers in awe of her wit and wizardry with the written word; many who didn't  believe in magic  became fully enchanted.  By contrast, The Casual Vacancy is a regular novel, with a reasonably interesting but not extraordinary plot.  Some of the sex scenes are really quite superfluous- even amateurish, as if a highschool student were trying to shock his Creative Writing teacher.  There were too many forgettable characters doing unremarkable things.  Try again, JK, but maybe don't try so hard.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Voxel Invaders is a game inspired by the classical Space Invaders where the goal is to destroy waves of aliens invading our solar system. Voxel Invaders is the sequel to Retrocosmos, the game released in 2011 by the same team of two French developers. It is based on the same concept: a retro-style arcade game with a fun gameplay and ultra simplified single-finger controls. However in Voxel Invaders all the graphics have been created based on 3D models constructed from hundreds of voxels (the 3D equivalent of a pixel), which gives the game a really unique visual style that oscillate between classical 2D retro and modern 3D.<br /><br />I really enjoyed playing this one, especially the last levels get completely crazy with retro style effects simulating buggy screen, noisy pixels and tetris/arkanoid levels.<br /><br />A must have!
B000XQXD9G|5.0|Ooooh yes. First abaout myself.<br /><br />I wrote more than 900 reviews on the German amazon page. I am also a big fan of horror trash movies of the 70s, I just say: Tenebre, Maneater, and that movie where the time runs backwards.<br /><br />Just saw that classic horror movie. In faist germany its forbidden to watch the movie. so i had to drive to italy to my beloved friend to watch it. Fortunately my Italian os very good so i could understand everything. the only critical point is that every actor looks the same: they all have brown curls and they are going bald at the temples. So it took me 45 minutes to differenciate that grumpy dude from that Franco dude, who is by the way the murder *winkwink*. Why is Simone a man - I didnt understand that either. Here in goold old Germany it is clearly a mans name. Ok Soldi Doro is ringing at the door - See Ya fellas.<br /><br />PS: Hmmja, Hmjja. Take care of the dollar!

0345803485|1.0|I don't know what I find more stunning: the childish writing and the simple plot or the fact that this book is number one. Are you people kidding me? This book reminds me of the Harlequin romances I used to read as a child, same style, same themes. I'm only on page 50 and it's making me sick. First of all, the main character \\"Anastasia\\" blushes all the time, every single friggin page as a matter of fact. The author must have went nuts trying to think of all the ways she could use to describe a blush. That got real old, real fast.<br /><br />Secondly the way they address each other is completely unreal and silly. They go from last names to first names to whole names to nicknames. Choose one!<br /><br />Overall lousy story.

The book's real world astronomy, with technology not overly exaggerated, will appeal to readers of all ages. If you're an avid amateur astronomer, like me, you must read this classic. Endings are always the toughest part to write (I struggle in my own books), and Sagan has stepped up to the challenge, with a firmer ending than in the movie-version of this book.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I'm admittedly an Apple fanboy, but it's pretty frustrating that I have to keep buying adapters for adapters... literally.  With my new retina MacBook Pro, there are no FireWire ports.  That's okay with me since the computer is thinner than the port itself, but I feel like the computer should come with a few adapters for FireWire and Ethernet.  In any case, this connects the Thunderbolt port directly to FireWire 800 devices, but if you have a FireWire 400 device, you have to get a FireWire 800 to 400 adapter or cable.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|Mr. Follett must be a fan of Marshall McLuhan, or at least a firm believer in the concept of the world as a global village. As in the previous book of this trilogy, most of his characters belong to only four families, yet they keep bumping into each other, flirting, marrying, fighting among themselves all around the world, up and down the century, as if the planet were a dozen-house, single-pub country village. Notwithstanding, they and their masters are mysteriously able to ignore links that scream to be noticed. A young US lieutenant is sent to check on security risks -chiefly Communists- among the staff of Manhattan Project (the nuclear bomb makers), but neither he nor his superiors seem to be aware that his father's brother is a senior Soviet general, and his first cousin an officer in Red Army's intelligence.<br />That said, Mr. Follett is still a master storyteller, more than capable of keeping the reader locked to his pages. I have read all his books and will read all the following ones, starting with the trilogy's third book.

B008I3QZKU|4.0|There have been some great albums released this year, yet Battle Born was my most anticipated and it's been a long time coming. To put it simply: this album is different from what I was expecting, yet that's not a bad thing. Like many fans, I was hoping for a harder sound and a bit more teeth, similar to the meatier sound of previous efforts like [[ASIN:B000GY729M Sam's Town]]. However, The Killers have never been a band to repeat themselves and that's part of what makes them a favorite of mine. They've grown and continued to carve their own path, even if that means losing some fans along the way. Battle Born isn't the monster rock album I was craving but that doesn't make it any less compelling.<br /><br />There's a lot to like here. Songs like \\"Flesh and Bone\\", \\"A Matter of Time\\", \\"Runaways\\", and the album's title track are exactly what you'd expect from the group at this point. They're hard-hitting, energetic, and destined to become staples of their catalogue. Brandon's voice sounds better than ever and his vocal performance is truly incredible, delivering the passion and energy necessary to really carry these songs. For those of you who enjoyed his solo album (as I did) then the tracks \\"Heart of a Girl\\" and \\"Here With Me\\" will sound instantly familiar. The country and gospel influence of [[ASIN:B003NX6ZDC Flamingo]] is definitely present, yet it never overtakes the record and only seeps in on a few tracks. The biggest surprise is the country-flavored \\"From Here on Out\\", which works brilliantly. It's completely different from anything the band has done but it suits them surprisingly well. I also want to give special mention to \\"Be Still\\". It's haunting, beautiful, and arguably the album's best track. It floored me the first time I heard it and after a dozen listens it still gives me chills.<br /><br />Battle Born has obviously thrown many fans for a loop. The mixed reviews here prove that everyone had different expectation for this album and after four years I can certainly understand why some fans are feeling let down. This is another direction for The Killers and I'll admit that it takes some patience and repeated listens to fully embrace. It wasn't what I expected but it's a welcome surprise and it's great to have them back. It doesn't reach the heights of their previous work but it doesn't need to. It's fantastic and well worth exploring for yourself.n certainly understand why some fans are feeling let down.

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The much-hyped and much debated Prometheus finally makes its way to DVD & Blue-Ray with enough versions to satisfy even those grumpy Engineers! For those wanting the film with no filler, you can get it on DVD or Blue Ray. For slightly more or for the same price you can get the DVD/Blue Ray Combo Pack, or if you're like me and you \\"gotta have it all\\", the four-disc collectors edition is the best choice.<br /><br />Prometheus was the very-much anticipated prequel to the cinematic and visual powerhouse that was Alien. When the trailer hit the big screen almost a year prior to its release, I was one of many Alien fans eagerly waiting for the film's release. This one wasn't worth the wait.<br /><br />What you got were two movies in one. A story centering around the \\"Who created us & why are we here\\" question, with the Alien story arguably used as a bait-and-switch tactic to extend the franchise's sequel potential. Numerous plot holes and rediculous character senarios turned \\"smart science fiction\\" into an ultra stylized B-movie that would make Ed Wood proud.<br /><br />The film delivers on two fronts. Director Ridley Scott's brillant visual mastery and Michael Fassbender's equally brillant performance as David. Like any truley great visonary, Scott demonstrates how 3-D movies(if you saw the 3-D version in theaters)can shine when the technique is used by a master of cinema visuals. The 3-D version of the film, like James Cameron's Avitar, pales in comparison to the big-screen version.<br /><br />Prometheus is worth the view & purchase, it just fails to live up to its hype. I personally suggest the four-disc version so you can enjoy the total experience. The film unfortunatley, is an unworthy follow up to a classic science fiction film that terrifies to this day. The events leading up to how the famous \\"Space Jockey\\" was left in the chair with his chest exploded open was all myself and every Alien fan wanted to know. This film leaves die-hard Alien fans feeling cheated more than satisfied. I also suggest you take the great Arthur J Bullock Jr. Scientist Survival Pop Quiz in the Amazon customer review section before you watch the movie. A sticker on the DVD/Blue-Ray box says questions will be answered. Hope the answers are somehwere in the DVD/Blu-Ray extras. Visually brillant film, but horrifically flawed story telling.

B0009HLD0K|4.0|This film has survived, although grainy at times as far as film quality -but what can you expect from a 70's flick that has not been digitally restored to the quality of some of the more popular movies of that time (i.e. Star Wars). Still, the film quality is good. This film captures the cycling climate of the day and features many great training and racing scenes -love the tractor trailer drafting scene! This is more than a cycling movie though. The struggle of coming of age, finding your identity, family dynamics -love and support; father and son, competition, love story, and campy comedy -it's all there. This is a film you will love, and feel comfortable sharing with your family.

B007THA4FI|4.0|After Harry Potter, we all know that JKR is a good storyteller, but who knew she could write as well!<br /><br />I bought this book mainly on the strength of the bad reviews, most of which struck me as ill-informed or foolish.  This book is exactly what it was marketed as - a bleak, adult novel about a real world small town.  Yes, the bulk of characters are unlikeable, but the majority of them also have some redeeming quality.  That's how it is in life as well.  The grasp JKR has on human nature is astounding, she absolutely nails all the petty motivations people have for acting as they do.  Anyone who has ever lived in a small town will recognise people they know in this book, and will see both the humour and the pathos in the writing.  I agree with the reviews that said the first 100 or so pages are a bit slow, but after that it really takes off and I sat up all night until I finished it.<br /><br />I wanted to stay away from Harry Potter comparisons, because let's face it, HP was a freak phenomenon and I think comparisons are neither fair nor valid, but I think that the biting tone is similar, though more adult in this book.  In HP, it was the way JKR humanised the characters and their relationships that was a large part of the appeal, and she does the same thing in The Casual Vacancy.  The difference is that HP was a fantasy, so things could afford to be a bit idealised and rosy, whereas this book is about reality.<br /><br />At any rate, I liked it and I hope it will jolt some people out of their middle-class stupors, which I think is the intended effect.

B0040YR546|5.0|I love this film!  I bought several copies of the dvd (1 for myself & the others to give to my family & friends) ~2 years ago but bought this Blu-ray bc I've finally stepped into the new tech age ;)<br /><br />Gonna keep this very brief, others can give u a synopsis from beginning to end; I'm gonna tell u in general what makes this show good & sets it apart from most films (ASIDE from the VERY good & ORIGINAL plot!).<br /><br />Sometimes we have movies that we like but don't know/analyze why we like them; pace is really 1 of these things that we often consciously never think about (when pace is off, sometimes an otherwise decent movie, just doesn't \\"sit right\\" w/ us, w/ Kick-Ass, we don't have this problem ;) that makes or breaks a film.  Kick-Ass has unparalleled pace throughout; I've found that this seems to b the hardest thing for films to achieve (based on my empirical evidence ;), even most of my other favs don't have this down.  The filming of this movie (i.e. ESPECIALLY the camera angles, all that went into shot composition, casting, & usage of colors) was VERY well planned/thought out; all of this shows & that's why the pace is so exceptional.<br /><br />You can pause ANYWHERE during movie & you've got a work of art!  There's so much visual interest in this Kick-Ass; the city, buildings, & rooms are all given good character & have personalities.<br /><br />I love the story of Kick-Ass & I love the characters/their acting (I actually LOVE EVERYTHING about Kick-Ass;).  Superficially, this is A LOT of fun & great to look @ but on the less conscious level, this movie engages/keeps you there bc of how much you r seeing but also what u don't ;) aka BUY THIS, YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO!

B005LAIHRC|4.0|\\"Rock of Ages\\" is a film adaptation of the classic Broadway musical.  It's got some feel good moments in the movie, that will have you singing along with some old rock and roll numbers.  It's a blast from the past that made me feel like you've stepped back through time.  Rock and roll will never die, it lives on in this musical movie.  I love Broadway musicals, because they tell a story that we can all remember them by.  And this one, will certainly be kept in my heart, even though it does contain some strong sexual content, it doesn't go too over the top.  But the music is what keeps the characters alive and strong as they sing all throughout the movie.  Adam Shankman (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's \\"Once More, With Feeling,\\" and \\"Hairspray,\\") directed another memorable movie that could be watched a numerous of times.  Tom Cruise really sings really well and as with the other cast members.  You never know who's gonna be the next Broadway star, in the movie business.  The songs touched the story in a way that could be remembered that in the age of rock of roll, does not change a person's personality for the turn of the worst, but for another generation of music.  You either gotta love or hate this movie, I simply love it for the genre.  I can't wait for more.

B0083F5J7S|4.0|I like every single cut on this cd.  The music is top notch if you are a Maroon 5 enthusiast.  My only complaint is the cheap cardboard cover.  The cd is a few bucks more expensive than the other cds I purchased but the others all arrived in crystal protective cases. This is my expectation.  Not Overexposed.  After opening the package, the cd constantly falls out unless you store it flat or make sure the open side points up.  For the money - they can afford a hard case that closes securely. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars.

B004J4WKTW|2.0|For the longest time I was obsessed about finding this book. It was always such a disappointment when I couldn't get it, either because of the price (which was originally 17$ for Kindle or because the stores I looked for it at, didn't have it. I assumed it was that great of a story if I couldn't find the book, which only lead to more disappointment. . .<br /><br />Having finally (Thank God!) Finished this book, I cant help but feel robbed. Not of the time and energy that was put into reading the book but of the endless of possibilities of what the story could have been but wasn't.<br /><br />There were simply so many places that the plot line could have taken me to. I did enjoyed the read, but I kept waiting to be swept away by the magic of the circus and that simply never happened. . . =(<br /><br />You reach the end with more questions than answers. Its not that the book was an open ended, its that there were GAPS in the plot line. You never get a solid answer on what happens to Marco & Celia, what exactly became of them and their life together. The competition was never as fierce as they made it sound, the love not as magical and deep as described. And the same goes for Bailey and Poppet, whom personally I would have love to have more of instead of these worthless 2 page chapter on random circus acts and descriptions which in my personal opinion added absolutely nothing to the plot line.<br /><br />I enjoy a good descriptive storytelling as much as the next person. It sets the atmosphere for the world/place that the author is taking you to, but to focus solely on every detail of the circus, and so blatantly ignore the many wonderful opportunities for the story line to take off to and take the reader with it. . . I just kept thinking to myself that the story line was getting better, that at any moment it would take off and take me with it... It never did.<br /><br />The book is called The Night Circus, and that is the main focus of the book. The Circus, the people with in it and around it are more of a need than a focus. She touches on all subjects but never really goes in deep about anything BUT The Circus.with in it and around it are more of a need than a focus.

B008AT71WI|5.0|Knowing that Frank Oz was behind and endorsed this particular home release I decided to buy the Blu-Ray. And I was NOT disappointed.<br /><br />Last night I sat through both the Theatrical Version and the Director's Cut and was amazed at the digital clarity of the picture in both cases. I was even more amazed by the 5.1 re-master of the sound. This is what home movie viewing should be. The music comes from all around you, and the voices stay on the screen.<br /><br />Although not in HD, there's also a good number of bonus extras for this release and I do love me a good \\"behind the scenes/Making of\\" feature!<br /><br />I DO have a few minor issues regarding this release:<br /><br />1) I hate the packaging. I understand the need to go green by using less plastic.... and to have this product stand out as something special with it's packaging design, but this packaging does nothing to keep the blu-ray safe. There's also a liner note from Frank Oz in the packaging, but it's a loose piece of paper that can slip out and be lost because the packaging doesn't seal shut. Rather, it's a 36 page BOOK with the inside back cover holding the disc.  I also feel that after a good amount of reading through the book that this product will fall apart. The same could have been done with a standard blu-ray clam shell.<br /><br />2) The Blu-Ray menu is bland and your choices aren't easily seen since all the icons look very similar.<br /><br />BUT... that's the physical aspects of the merchandise.  The meat and potatoes is the great work that's on the blu-ray.  THANK YOU, FRANK!!!!
B0056FMNYA|4.0|Hi<br />Was not sure about the B-Grip at first but now i have tryed it i can highly recommend this product. it does has it claims and holds the camrea firm and secure on your waist, the camera is then easy to remove and replace from the belt and its great being hands free when not using your camera knowing that it is safe and secure on your waist. the B-Grip works well and removes the need for a camera neck strap.<br />you just need to be aware of were your camera is when walking through door ways and in small tight spaces since it is easy to forget its there.<br />Herbs

B007UEJEO2|4.0|We all know the first is a groundbreaking classic but it is easy to forget how good the 3rd is considdering how poor the second was.<br />as much as i love Speilberg I do believe he destroyed what was a great book in the Lost World deciding to go with improved special effects due to upgrades in technology hence bringing TRex to San Diego wich never happened in Micheal Crichton's lost world<br /><br />Sam Neil returns for the 3rd as Dr Allen Grant to lead an expedition he never knew he was going to lead to find a lost boy and the story is back where it belongs, a story of survival on an island of deadly monsters.<br />The big monster T-rex from the previous movies is nothing compared to the new Spinosaurus and this statement is made very early on when it kills the T-rex.<br /> Some of the behavior from the people in this movie is a little weird and stupid and most likely a result of the original script being torn up 5 weeks before they commenced filming, though i don't think that is a great excuse to have everyone running around yelling out for others.<br /> The action comes quick and regually and that is the strengh of this chapter and is pretty suspenseful and believable(if there was an island full of dinosaurs).<br />The bluray tranfer is spectacular and this is easily the most visually stunning and believable of all 3 movies, the only scene that looked fake was the opening parasailing scene wich is obviously a green screen.<br /><br />I watched this with 3D conversion and really felt immersed in the movie and the 7.1 soundtrack is awesome.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I just happen to preview this CD because the name sounded interesting.<br />I had never heard of this cat.<br /><br />WOW!

B007TK77QE|4.0|I'll give the naysayers one thing - it is kind of a slow burn and you probably won't be racing through the first few chapters with your heart pounding.  I can even understand why someone without a lot of time to read could put it down and forget to put it back up, but when it gets going this is a cracking domestic melodrama that will have you grabbing a few pages whenever you can.  I was also pleasantly surprised that it's much less preachy than I've been led to believe, I suspect J. K. Rowling and I don't see eye to eye on matters of social security and public housing, but not once does this book veer into progaganda, and if it didn't change my opinion about anything, it also didn't make me feel angry or even particularly challenged.  Yes, it's a tad expensive and I'm the first to admit that I bought it so I wasn't left behind when people were discussing it, but if it's not worth paying for right this minute, it's still one you want to bookmark and not forget about.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|This movie is a good visual sci-fi movie with good acting by some really good actors . It ends there. It was intended as a prequel to the Alien Franchise and failed horribly. I had hopes for this movie being under the original director, but it failed. James Cameron set the ALIEN franchise out of everyone else's reach apparently, since every Alien film since has utterly failed. Mainly because the fans want more of what James Cameron gave us in ALIENS. Hollywood can't seem to grasp that notion. I do not recommend paying over 5 bucks for this movie.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I enjoyed the similarities to the Castle TV show. It is a good light read, the same as two others that I have read in this series.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Wow. It's rare for a film to live up to or surpass the hype given to it. The big examples are Avatar and The Avengers. The films didn't live up to or deserve the endless praise given to them, while on the other end The Hunger Games and The Dark Knight Rises lived up to and surpassed the praise given to them. I hadn't heard much about Looper except for that Bruce Willis was in it along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and it involved time travel. For months and in recent days just like The Master has been seemingly getting endless praise from critics, and some time I do question the professional critics out there. They many times seem to heap heavy praise on films that absolutely don't deserve it and ignore films that do. Maybe they think to highly of themselves I don't know, but I never trust critics entirely. That's why I went into the film not setting the bar to high. Of course I was going to see the film it had Bruce Willis in it. I can't think of the last film he stared in that I hadn't seen. No the Expendables 2 doesn't count. It wasn't his film and he has basically a cameo in it. Bruce Willis is the man and I'll see virtually anything he stars in.<br /><br />Does the film live up to the hype and praise give to it? Yes it does, but does it surpass it that's what I'll get to in my review. First off Looper isn't original it isn't the first to do time travel. It has been done many times from Star Trek, the Terminator films, Frequency, Returner and all the way back to the 1960 classic The Time Machine, so don't expect something truly original. What you do get is something unique well thought out and nearly perfectly executed. The story follows Joe (Levitt/Willis) who is a killer for the mob in Kansas run by Abe (Jeff Daniels) in 2044. The catch is he's a special kind of killer called a Looper. These killers are assigned one task to kill men sent from the future year of 2074 where time travel has been invented and outlawed by the government, and only criminal organizations use it to get rid of people they want dead, because it is virtually impossible to completely get rid of the body in the future. These Loopers lead a good life earning large sums of silver with each kill. There is only one catch to the job and that is in the contract they sign. The catch is they will at one point have to kill their future selves. It quiet the self-cleaning process the mob has devised. The use these killers in the past to get rid of certain elements in the future and to keep the Loopers from talking in the future they send them back to be killed. You can see how a Looper might hesitate to kill his future self and it happens on occasion and the mob has a pretty easy system to deal with that in torturing and killing the present man. That leads us to past Joe meeting his future self-played by the one and only Bruce Willis. Things get out of hand when past Joe hesitates and his future self knocks him out. I can see how that might be confusing to read so I'll stick to their names. Bruce leaves Joseph a note to run and heads to the city. Things get complicated when Joseph doesn't run and heads back to the city to clean up the mess. Only Abe is having none of it deciding to wipe them both out. I won't go into too much more detail about the plot except that Bruce has a plan to change the future to save himself and his wife. That leads Joseph to a farm and Sara (Emily Blunt). The plot is pretty unique. The closest time travel film I could compare it to is Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1994 Time Cop. The decent Time Travel film has kind of the same premise except in reverse. The film just doesn't go as far as it could deciding to just be an action film and nothing more. Looper goes beyond the simple theme and asks questions about Time Travel and what would you do. Like would you kill children if it meant fixing your future and saving your loved ones? How far would you go to change things and can you actually change anything or are you living an endless loop. Looperis a Noir Sci-fi Thriller that blends elements from great films like Blade Runner, China Town, Witness and Bruce Willis's other great Time Travel film Twelve Monkeys. The only flaws in plot were small ones like how did Sara know Joseph was a Looper. Does everyone know about Loopers? The second thing was the parts of the second have faltered a little when they delved into telekinesis. This is me essentially nit picking so people reading this can't complain that I'm saying the film is perfect.<br /><br />The chemistry by Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was brilliant. These two worked great together mimicking each other well. Bruce is primarily known for being an action star, but the man can act. He's shown it in Twelve Monkeys, Sin City, Unbreakable and other films and Joseph is really becoming one of the best actors of this age. He's proved that in the films I've seen him in which include The Lookout, Inception and the Dark Knight Rises. I haven't seen Jeff Daniels in a lot of films recently, but he worked with Joseph in The Lookout and he was in the fun spider film Arachnophobia and the good civil war film Gettysburg. He is a capable actor and shows it here in Abe mob boss from the future who isn't truly a bad guy. There really isn't a bad guy in the film, but if there were Abe would be the closest thing to it. Then there is Emily Blunt as Sara. She has a limited role in the film only being it from about the half-way point, but what she does with it is heart breaking. I've only seen her in two films but she is brilliant. I loved her in The Adjustment Bureau and she again does a great job. All the characters are flawed looking for redemption and a better life. From saving wife's life to trying to get to Paris, France, or save their child these characters are striving to make a live for themselves even if it is futile.<br /><br />Does Joseph Gordon-Levitt look like Bruce Willis? Yes, but not perfectly. The makeup people did a brilliant job trying to make Josephlook like a younger Bruce and they partially get there. I'd say they are around 75 percent of the way there. If with the slight flaws the actors acting covers it up easily. The effects weren't anything special, because like Dredd 3D this film had a tiny budget. I believe it has a budget between 30 to 40 million which again tiny compared to modern Hollywood. Still the effects people did a good keeping the future possible. What I mean not going overboard with flying cars, teleporters and the such. The effects and writers kept things in the reals of possible. To be honest though I enjoy special effects and CGI I think when you go overboard with them you take away from the story and characters. The writers and directors know when and when not to use them in the film and it works. I don't think anyone will have any complaints about them. The action is also well done with again nothing truly over the top and Bruce Willis is perhaps the action king. Though I'm sure others would argue that point. To be perfectly honest I've never heard of the director Rian Johnson before. Looking him up I see he's directed Brick and The Brothers Bloom, and again to be honest I haven't seen or heard of these films, but from his job as director of Looper I can tell he has a chance of a very bright future.<br /><br />Did this for me surpass the praise given to it? Yes without question it did. This film beautifully blends genre's including thriller, noir, action and sci-fi, and inspired by great films like Blade Runner, Chinatown and Twelve Monkey's. Though nothing truly original or ground breaking the film as unique and wonderfully written story along with excellent acting by the great cast. The effects were good, but nothing out of this world along with great action. This is a thinking man's well executed Sci-fi film and I beyond highly recommend seeing this film, and even more than once. I will be seeing it again this weekend. Looper: A truly great film.
0525952616|3.0|I completely loved Daemon and Freedom. I had kill decision on my wishlist right from the start. Its not nearly as good as the first two. If you really liked Daemon, then skip Kill Decision and read \\"Ready Player One\\" by Ernest Cline instead.  You'll thank me.
B005LAII80|5.0|I had a great night at the movies. I got to see a Dredd for free thanks to a friend from college who is an assistant manager at a Regal Cinemas nearby and I got to see a great film. First before I go on to my review of the film I need to tell you two things. First I'm not as big of a hater of Stallone's Dredd as others. I believe I gave the film 2.5 stars if I remember correctly. Stallone was not good as Dredd unless you use his acting performance as comedy. Armand Assante who I think is a really good, but not great actor does a decent job as the bad guy, but he wasn't the right actor for it. The plot was overblown and ridiculous. The action and special effects were good, and Rob Schneider was good as the comedic side kick. He's funnier as a sidekick then staring in his own films. I know people bash it because it wasn't like the comics which leads me to my second thing I need to tell you. I have never read the comics, so I can only judge this film on the cinematic quality or simply how much I liked it or not. I don't know why I haven't read the comics. I just never got around to it. There are hundreds if not thousands of different comics out there. I can't read them all. Though hopefully after seeing this film I'll find the time download them or read them online, so again this is only a review of the film. I'll leave that kind of review for the people who've read the comics.<br /><br />As for Dredd is an awesome film, but not perfect. It has its limitations with its budget and story, but again it's a great action film. The story like I said is pretty simplistic. Anyone who's seen the recent film The Raid: Redemption will find similarities with their plot, though this film is much better. It is sometime in the future after some kind of nuclear war and one of the few places that remains is Mega-City One that encompasses the range of Boston to Baltimore. There in this hell hole of survivors fighting for survival the only organization that keeps order are the Judges. Two judges Dredd (Karl Urban) and the rookie physic judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) who's failed her training tests and the Hall of Justice only gives her another chance with Dredd for her physic abilities. These two judges head to the Peach Trees Tower where three men have been murdered. The two judges investigate and capture a small time drug leader who deals in the new drug called Slo-Mo, which slows the brain down and everything seems to go in slow motion. The drug kingpin of the entire 200 story building Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) can't let the man testify and seals down the building from there the action and fun truly begin. On a side not I can see this possibly happening sometime in the not too distant future where the US is a police state. I'm sure some would say were already there. As I said a pretty simple plot, but as I said it works for this film. From what I hear and read this film had a budget 45 million. I could be wrong, but even if I am by today's standard of action/Sci-fi films it isn't much and not even have the budget of Stallone's film. The writers of this film knew the constraints they had and kept things simple focusing mainly on three characters. The partner/mentor relationship between Anderson and Dredd, and Ma-Ma and it works really well.<br /><br />It's a risk having your main character head covered the entire film, but it works in this film and that is thanks to Karl Urban who blows Stallone's performance away. Even with the helmet on Urban is still able to give a human element to Dredd. Over the last handful of years I've come too really like the actor. He was one of if the only bright spot in Doom and of course his great role as Dr. Leonard McCoy. This is an actor who needs to be given more chances to shine. The gorgeous Olivia Thirlby also did a superb job as Judge Anderson. She really shows the scared and damaged emotions of the mutant physic who wants to become a judge and her growth in the film. I had never heard of the beautiful actress before this film, but she can act and I hope to see her in more films. The chemistry between the partners was great, and if there is a sequel which I truly hope this film makes enough money for then I would really like to see them as maybe partners. How many cop action films have a man and woman as partners? I can't think of any off the top of my head. The two did a really good job and I think it can work again in sequel. Lena Headey is another actress I haven't really heard of. I was surprised to see that she played Sarah Conner in the Terminator TV series and Queen Gorgo. I did not remember that. Anyway she did a good job playing the ex-hooker turned ruthless drug kingpin. Oh I also forgot to mention Wood Harris who plays Kay the guy the judges arrest and Ma-Ma doesn't want to testify. Yeah the film has a tiny cast with one or two minor roles and tones of extras, but like I said the writers new their limitations with the budget they had.<br /><br />The slow motion worked in this film. I was a little nervous like I think others were about the slow motion scenes in the film, but it worked great enhancing the action. I also think it worked because they didn't go overboard with it. The action in the film was raw and gritty, and great. This is definitely an R-rated action film and to be honest this is more of an action film then Sci-fi film. Though there is a lot of blood I don't think the effects people went overboard with it keeping it believable. The effects were just decent. You could tell that the director and effects people had a limited budget, but I think it was a good thing. For a first film of a possible franchise you need to keep things simple. That was one of the problems with Stallone's Dredd. I think they tried to do this overblown action Sci-fi film with at the time a limited fan base. That was before comic film skyrocketed. This Dredd on the other hand doesn't try to do too much with the effects and it works.<br /><br />Pete Travis the director along with Reliance and DNA films did a good job with the making of Dredd. The other film I saw that Travis directed was Endgame staring William Hurt, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Johnny Lee Miller is a good film and shows how good a job Travis can do with a limited budget. I think he perhaps even does a better job with this film as it is his first time doing a comic action/sci-fi film. I also need to give credit to Reliance, DNA the production companies along with the distributor Lionsgate for taking a chance with the film after the total bomb of the previous Dredd film. Lionsgate is turning into one of my favorite production/distributing film studios. Sure like every studio they've made some bad films, but in recent years the quality of their films have gone way up and they've been making better films all around.<br /><br />Don't go into Dredd expecting a Sci-fi film or out of this world special effects because you won't get them. Overall Dredd is a great action film with a limited to mid-range budget with a good story, great acting, great action, decent special effects, and good directing. This film makes Stallone's Dredd look like a pile of sh*t. The film doesn't have to have a sequel, but I hope it earns enough for one. I haven't read the comics, but I think people who have will enjoy this film as well along with everyone else. Give Dredd a chance and remember to keep your eyes open for Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby two good actors who need to be recognized.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its not great but at least its fun. don't mind those bad reviews there crazy its fun. get it and see for your self.
B0006VIE4C|3.0|Over the past week and a half I have re-watched the two Star Wars trilogy's, and decided to review the films because I have taken issue with the blind defense of the original films and hate for the prequels. There's the childhood version and the adult version of Star Wars IV: A New Hope. I think many people blindly hold to the vision of the film they had as a child. As a child growing up in the 1980's I loved the film and films. I would usually watch them once a week playing with the action figures pretending to be the characters with my cousin and friends. I loved my Boba Fett action figure I had. As you can tell he was my favorite character in the first Star Wars series followed by Han Solo and Chewbacca. Sadly I lost those toys along with the my original Transformer toys like Megatron, Jazz, Grimlock, Star Scream and my others that were more likely were thrown out by my mother. Damn I wish I still had them they had good memories and I could sell them for a lot of money. Anyway back to A New Hope. As a child I loved the film never noticing the flaws or problems, and there are quite a few. I think people need to be realistic and wake up from the childhood haze of the old Star War Series<br /><br />The plot everyone should know by now. It follows a young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill who lives with his aunt and uncle on a farm on the planet Tatooine. He lives a boring live wishing to leave the farm for adventure. Things change when his aunt and uncle buy C-3PO and R2-D2 from Jawa traders. R2-D2 shows Luke a message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) asking for help from Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The adventure takes off from there as all of you surely know. The story was written by George Lucas and is generally good. There are a few problems like the main character in Luke Skywalker. As a kid I didn't really pay attention to how unlikeable and annoying the character was, but as an adult you can see it. Then there is the Death Star. I don't understand why the Empire was building it. Talk about a waste of money. They could have just used the money to build enough star ships to overwhelm the resistance. Then there is the flaw in the design. Really they left a little hole in the ship that could take down the entire death star. Finally Darth Vader, Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and the other commanders didn't bother putting more starships around The Death Star for defense.<br /><br />Even with the flaws I had with the story the acting was really good. The great actors Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness did an excellent job, and so did the now legendary Harrison Ford (Han Solo). He imbued his great charisma and good acting into the best character of the original Star Wars saga. James Earl Jones was magnificent as Vader's voice. Carrie Fisher did a decent job, but like Luke, Leia wasn't a very likeable character. Then there is Mark Hamill who I think did his best as Luke in the first A New Hope. Trying to show his naivety and slowing to come terms with his fate. Still either the way he acted or the way Lucas wrote the character Luke Skywalker comes out as unlikeable and annoying. I also much mention Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca) who brilliantly brought life the Wookiee.<br /><br />What was and is astounding are the special effects. George Lucas did manage to put in amazing special effects for the time with a tiny budget, and more importantly what Lucas did with little help from Fox, which was to his advantage as he kept many of the rights including merchandizing ones. Lucas nearly perfectly blended genres and elements from movies and films like The Hidden Fortress, Flash Gordon, The Guns of Navarone to name a few. It is remarkable what George Lucas achieved with A New Hope. He wrote the story for the film and his drive to see it created and brought to live in theaters is a testament to him. I'm sure many filmmakers would have given up after being turned down by many movie studios and the limited budget and time he had to work on the film, but he persevered. In doing so he created a universe that through him has brought on a life of its own through the sequels, pop culture references, spinoffs in the form of books and television shows and he inspired would inspire filmmakers, actors, and movie goers for generations to come. I will talk more about Lucas later in my reviews for the other five films.<br /><br />As a child I think I would have given Star Wars IV: A New Hope 5 stars. Does it live up to my childhood memories? No it doesn't. It has plot holes in the story and flaws with the characters. That being said A New Hope is a great starting point with for a fun adventure with a unique story, interesting characters and great action special effects. I know it's hard to ruin your childhood memories, but I think people need to stop blindly defending the original films over the prequels. I know it's hard to see the flaws in things you loved as a child. It was hard for me. As a kid I loved the old GI. JOE cartoon, but as an adult you see the many flaws in the story, characters and the lack of bloodshed and death in a cartoon about solders who are trying to kill each other. It's the same for a film like Independence Day as a young teenager I loved the film I think I would have given it 4.5 out of 5 stars, but as an adult I saw the flaws in the film and I now have only given it 3 stars. Overall Star Wars is my 5th favorite out of the six Star Wars films and a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Free and works as advertised.  Works great for tablets with weak batteries like this eLocity A7+ 004. Helps to get the best performance possible out of your battery.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|As someone who travels for a living this is a wonderful way to maintain some consistency in many sleep habits. The gentle and relaxing sounds help to signal my slumber even though I may be in a drastically different time zone. The best feature of this white noise generater is the ability to combine sounds. You can truly create almost any scene with the sounds provided. For me this is a must have app.

B00846REIS|1.0|This book follows 50 shades of grey way too closely. It even uses so many of the same words, i actually checked to see the copywrite on each. easy reading but disappointing.
1423140605|3.0|Both Piper and Jason piss me off so much, they think they're so much better than everyone else in the book and all they do is talk about how hot one another is, and how everyone else is ugly, I have seen the pictures that Rick Riordan drew of both of them and they said that Jason looked tough, R U KIDDING ME??? I don't care if he's the son of Jupiter, I could still knock him out with one punch.

0525953728|2.0|Just finished this book. Interesting read for sure. Takes you there and back. My main complaint is the lack of respect this author has for his commander-in-chief. They were antsy to go on a mission they'd trained for and the president's the guy who gave the order and gave it fairly quickly, yet the author doesn't give him or any other civilian involved much credit, even though they are the ones with the intelligence. He says he's \\"not an arrogant warmonger\\" and yet his words say otherwise. I'm still trying to understand how he ends up being one of the shooters of bin Laden (there were three I think) when his team was given the guest house to clear first. He does that by killing a bin Laden aid and shoving the guy's wife and kids back into the house and then works his way up to the real action through several other guys. Anyway, a good read if you can get past the anti-Washington tone. I actually bipassed some of the stuff leading up to the mission.  It got boring for me.<br />Some reviews bring up the fact that Owen (pseudonym) takes shots at others than just Obama/Biden that got past me since I'm just an old woman and not military.  Speaking of women, Owen seems to have a condescending attitude towards us, which is not uncommon in arrogant men.  It also seems odd that the author was upset at the \\"leaks\\" he blames on Washington (he does give Obama credit for not \\"outing\\" the SEALS in his speech announcing the killing.), and then he proceeds to write a book.  Anyway, if you want to read a first hand account of the killing, buy the book and ignore the pot shots at people Owen dislikes, including the president.

B007THA4FI|1.0|JKRowling is a fantastic author. However she tries to hard in this book to prove that she can write an adult novel. I couldn't get past the pre story. Just lost interest in so many unsavory characters. Hope to see something more refreshing in the future.
B008LA7RMK|4.0|The Beach Boys Today! is absolutely among Brian Wilson's strongest productions and clearly, production-wise, points the way to the masterpiece Pet Sounds. The album is full of great tunes, with a lead vocal from every Beach Boy except Carl Wilson. In terms of Beach Boys canon - or rock canon in general - The Beach Boys Today! is a MUST.<br /><br />Now, for the 2012 mono/stereo review...first off, it appears that Capitol is doing with The Beach Boys what Apple/EMI did with The Beatles -- small digi-paks with the white band on the spine. There are no liner notes other than track listings and notations of which tracks are new stereo mixes. If you own the 1990 or 2001 \\"twofer\\" CD with Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!), this and the 2012 reissue of Summer Days... won't REPLACE the twofer, as you don't have the David Leaf liner notes or the bonus tracks. And for some reason, Capitol found it necessary to list each song twice on the back of the cover - once each for mono and stereo, instead of just listing them once and saying \\"Tracks 1-12 and 24 are mono, 13-23 are stereo\\" like it's written on the CD itself. (\\"Bull Session...\\" is in mono in both instances.)<br /><br />It's nice to finally hear this landmark album in stereo, but...well, the stereo mixes aren't the end-all be-all. As with Summer Days..., the stereo mix on this album seems to introduce a lot of distracting reverb that's not so audible on the mono version. Some of them are good, but some aren't...particularly \\"Please Let Me Wonder,\\" which has terrible equalization. Due to situations with original session tapes (i.e. missing vocal tracks), Dennis Wilson's lead vocal on the stereo mix of \\"In The Back Of My Mind\\" is only single-tracked, which in my opinion really takes away from the feel of the double-tracked mono. On the other hand, hearing just one Dennis vocal really shows what a great singer he could be when he put his heart and soul into it, and is an interesting hint as to the Dennis we'd hear on the Sunflower album five years later. The same session tape situation exists for \\"She Knows Me Too Well,\\" which previously was released once with a stereo mix and a single-tracked Brian vocal; however, the vocal on this version is double-tracked, but I have a feeling it was just the single-tracked vocal artificially doubled -- but it still sounds pretty good, to be honest.<br /><br />As with Summer Days..., the real star on this CD is...the mono mix of the album. Generally I'm a guy who prefers stereo over mono, but the new mastering on the mono mix is incredible! I've never heard this album so lively before! The equalization is really good. The only thing that some people might not like is that you can hear some tape hiss during quieter moments, but I'd rather hear that than the NoNoise destruction used on the 1990 reissue.<br /><br />But YOU NEED TO BUY THIS. The only reason this isn't a five-star review is that some of the stereo mixes leave much to be desired. Also, there's a problem with the mono version of \\"Please Let Me Wonder,\\" as the mix is off-balance and is heavy on the left. But the rest of the mono mixes are simply fantastic.

B007MB5OCE|1.0|Thinking that the premise  of this sounded interesting, I downloaded the Kindle sample. I'm glad I did, rather than buying the book outright, as I gave up after only a few pages due to the style, which I found irritating. There was too much detailed description of things that  didn't need it, and nothing that drew me in, despite my natural curiosity as to what would happen to the old man.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I'm not sure if I ever would've purchased it had it not been available with my Prime membership, but nonetheless I'm glad I watched it.  It was acted well enough to not have been corny, and Mindy McCrady was super memorable.
B000ASATYO|1.0|This is a great movie, it's not the movie I am having problems with, it's the distributer. I would like watch it at least once from my orders because I ordered the DVD twice and both didn't work and I tried on several DVD players. I am going to try one more time, hoping, maybe for the best, but, probably will get worst, if you get my meaning.
B007THA4FI|2.0|What a disappointment.  Who would have thought the same mind that made up the world of Harry Potter could create this mess.  I just didn't get it from the very beginning.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book was terrible.  Poorly written, pointless plot, and an Extremly unessisary dirty storie line.  I am shocked this is the same person that wrote Harry Potter.  Thank you so much Amazon for giving me a refund, I would hate to own this book!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Whenever a Streisand album is released, that day becomes Christmas day. This event is no exception.<br />As with every Streisand album, there are always a few tunes that instantly become owned by Streisand.  This album is no exception. Once you hear her version of \\"Didn't We\\"; \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\"; \\"How are Things in Glocca Morra\\" and 'Home\\", you will never ever appreciate any other artist singing those songs.<br />Streisand even out does Streisand with the other version of \\"With One More Look At You\\".<br />She is an American Entertainment Institution, with no peers.  This album just solidifies her status.<br /><br />BUY this album, and MERRY CHRISTMAS.
B0086449YA|5.0|Lovely album. Masterful songwriting and musicianship! Gorgeous pipes and acoustic guitars. In the vein of Knopfler's recent work, this album of Scottish folk inspired music is beautifully recorded. When it gets heavy, it's bluesy, different from the \\"Telegraph Road\\" sound.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|The album is basically just different variations of the same thing- like you've heard it all before even though they're new songs. That's pretty sad if you think about it. There's only so much you can do with the same song formula before it gets boring really fast.
1423140605|5.0|REVIEW BY: Arianna, age 9 years, 10 months<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />Annebeth, Percy, Jason, Piper, Hazel, Leo and Frank go on a quest to make sure there is not another war that starts with the Romans and the Greeks. Then a bad spirit who is one of Gaea's forces takes over Leo and makes the Romans want to destroy them so they flee and the Romans go after them. They go half-way around the world. When they go into The Pillars of Hercules, it becomes more and more dangerous. When they get to Rome they rescue Nico, Hazel's brother, while Annebeth is following the mark of Athena. When Annebeth succeeds following the mark of Athena, her and Percy fall into the underworld and the crew must close the doors of death.<br /><br />My favorite part was when they beat the giants because they completed their quest. I recommend this book for ages 7 and up and I give it 5 out of 5 stars.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|after reading so much negative about this cd,I just don't get it.the songs are performed well,bouncy.and easy on the ear.very enjoyable cd.I think it is one of her best.

B007THA4FI|4.0|If you are looking for a light , sunny read this is not the book for you.  If you can't handle seeing what really goes on in the lives of many sad souls this is not the book for you.  It is a look at the seamier side of life.  Rowling paints an accurate picture of what life is for many teens and adults in a small, rural town.  She captures their emotions brilliantly.  Is it depressing?  Yes.  Is it hard to read at times? Yes.  Is it a well constructed, deep piece of literature? Yes.  It is human emotion and raw need at its worst.  And it is very much like her Harry Potter books. They are dark and disturbing not light, sunny books either.  J K Rowling makes you feel strong emotions with her writing. She makes you think.  You need to look behind the story to see the real story she is telling. I had to come back and add to this review after continuing to read so many negative reviews. First- if you have not bothered to read the entire book please don't write a review - its not fair to the author. Second, if you bought this expecting Harry Potter that was your mistake not the author's. This book is clearly advertised as an adult fiction book. And finally, she did not write  a book about all of the inhabitants of a small town. She choose to write about a group that was bound together by a common  event /cause. That these people all had serious life issues they were dealing with was the setting of the book. Life is not always pretty. In fact I recognized many of the same issues I see  people I know dealing with- people you would never expect to have these kinds of issues/ problems. Someone commented that there was no clear character to root for.I disagree. I was rooting for all of them.
1593078684|5.0|I first discovered Yoshitaka Amano`s artwork when Final Fantasy VI was released, but also in a guidebook for this game, which was filled with many characters or scenes from the game. The designs were unlike anything that I imagined. To me, the paintings were wild, unique, excentric, and much more adult than the conventional character designs I found in 1990`s video games.<br /><br />Though there is of course a sense of caricature in his artwork, I felt Yoshitaka Amano's penstroke was dramatic and told a story about each character, whether it was Celes, Locke, Terra or the devilish Kefka. In fact, each drawing clearly defined the context and personality of the characters that were there. But I was disappointed that the only drawings I could find were in this guidebook or on the Web.<br /><br />But when I found out that Amano had released some of his character designs, sketches, and paintings for the first four Final Fantasy in this volume, I had to purchase a copy and relished each page. In each of them, I managed to spot and catch characters that I had found or played in the first four Final Fantasy. And I was marveled by the large sumi-ee painting called Dawn or Reimei in Japanese. To me, this painting was a visual presentation of Yoshitaka's imagination bubbling up before getting to work and bringing down the visual designs of the characters, monsters and architecture of the Final Fantasy worlds.<br /><br />Then again, I still wish that all the illustrations had been separated together into chapters identified by the games they were involved. It would have make it a little easier in identifying who went for what game, especially for some of the monsters. But then again. That is just a little detail that hasn't ruined my pleasure of reading this book, which I will soon accompany with the latest and richer book that Amano will release in October 2012, which means this month.<br /><br />So for me, this volume is an appetizer before the main dish.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Absolutely loved the book, but if you are looking for it to be like the movie, you will be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is way to much fun....for me.... I loose track of time...my frinds tell me I need to get a life.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I play it at every day. I can't wait to get all the stuff unlocked.
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best stories I've read. I highly recommend this Trilogy. Can't wait for the next book, I've read it twice already and I might read it a third time.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very thoughtful work. Reveals another level to the author, connects well to his other works. Like his approach to spirituality. Very engaging. Hope to see more.

B005ES11YW|5.0|These Crocs solved my problem with this type of shoe in the deserts of Arizona. I have a small ranch and a lot of cactus, so thorns are a problem with every walk outdoors. Not a problem any more but I do wish the hard part of the sole was a bit harder as they still pick up the thorns but because of the thickness they seldom penetrate. This is a great comfortable shoe to wear indoors or out. I found that if you order a size larger then you normally wear they will be too large. I wear a 10 - 10 ½ shoe and a size 10 in this shoe was perfect, the size 11 was way to large.
B007THA4FI|3.0|In her first attempt at \\"adult\\" fiction Ms. Rowling holds nothing back, using language and very graphic images that only very wel grounded adults should read.  All of her characters are seriously flawed, as are most of us; but they have made some very fateful decisions that affect those around them in very negative ways.  It is a very dark story, and the ending brings no relief from the sadness, only relief that the book has finally ended.
B00004SU5J|5.0|This excellent piece of work by St. Germain was long sought after. After hearing several songs, couldn't figure out the artist. Searched and searched and found it. Greatful Amazon had it for sale for a reasonable price. I'm a happy listener. Thanks!
B00006FM77|4.0|I think i saw a review that was titled somethng like worth it for the bonus disc alone. I agree a lot of the songs on the regular three discs stick close to the studio versions. Some are just as good and some are not Chicago toured hard back in the day and at this point in their tour were tired. As far as the fourth disc is concerned there are three songs that are better than the studio versions.<br /><br />1. Listen<br />2. Sing A Mean Tune Kid<br />3. South California Purples<br /><br />I urge everyone to listen to South California Purples it gets stretched out here to an amazing 12 minutes. Listening to this will have you realize why Jimi Hendrix said that Terry Kath was better than himself. Terry plays some of his best and most intense playng on this song he absolutely shreds. Robert Lamm gives a great vocal along with lots of Hammond B3. The rest of the band is great as well, you will not be bored during the 12 minutes!!!!!
B0021L9MJG|1.0|Hi, In this review I'm not going to be reviewing the film Creepshow itself because I'm biased, it's my favorite horror film of all time! I'm instead going to be going over the 2009 Blu-Ray release of Creepshow and how it really measures up!! In my opinion I was really, really disappointed with the 2009 Creepshow Blu-Ray and I think it is one of if not the worst old horror film to Blu-Ray conversions that I have ever seen!!!  And here's why -<br /><br />First - lets look at the Blu-Ray packaging/case itself. The cover of the Blu-Ray case has the same image as the front of Warner Home Video's 1999 bare-bones DVD snapecase release of Creepshow. Then you'll notice that the image on the Blu-Ray disc itself is just a closeup of the same image that's on the front of the Blu-Ray case!!! The overall packaging and design of the Blu-Ray sucks, it's basically the same as the 1999 snapcase!!!<br /><br />Secondly - lets look at the picture quality of the Creepshow Blu-Ray. The picture quality according to the information on the back of the Blu-Ray case says it's supposed to be 1080p High Definition 16x9 1.85:1. That's crap!!! I played the the Creepshow Blu-Ray on my PC(HD ViewSonic Monitor) and the 1999 Creepshow snapcase DVD on my Samsung HD flat screen TV at the same time. I put the computer monitor and TV side by side and watched them both to compare picture quality/see any differences. The 2009 Blu-Ray and the 1999 DVD are virtually the same, it's like they just ripped the film from the Warner's 1999 Creepshow snapecse DVD and burned that DVD image file straight to a Blu-Ray disc!!!<br /><br />Thirdly - let's take a look at the special features on the 2009 Creepshow Blu-Ray. I really could not believe that there was only one special feature on this Creepshow Blu-Ray disc!! That single special feature is just an original theatrical trailer from 1982. It's also the same trailer from the 1999 snapecase DVD. Also the picture quality of the trailer according to the info on the back of the Blu-Ray case is just 480i or 480p standard definition. Really, they give you only one frickin special feature a trailer and could not even convert the trailer to high definition!!! I also watched the trailers from the Blu-Ray and snapecase DVD side by side and they are both the same trailer with the same low definition quality!!!<br /><br />What's really pissing me off about the Creepshow Blu-Ray is this. In 2007 the company called Universal Pictures UK released a Creepshow (2 Disc Special Edition)DVD which was mind-blowingly amazing!!! That DVD set has the following special features - making-of documentary running 90 minutes (titled Just Desserts: The Making of Creepshow), behind-the-scenes footage, rare deleted scenes, galleries, a commentary track with director George A. Romero and make-up effects artist Tom Savini, just to name a few.  Unfortunately this amazing Creepshow 2 Disc Special Edition DVD set was only released in the UK and UK only, and is PAL/Region 2 DVD format!! How Can this amazing Creepshow 2 disc DVD set be only available in the UK and not the U.S., I mean it's a cult classic American horror film!! Also how can a U.S. released Blu-Ray of an American film be worse than a UK non-high definition DVD.<br /><br />In conclusion - The 2009 Blu-Ray release of Creepshow from Warner Home Video sucks, on a scale from 0-10 it gets a 1. If you already have he 1999 snapecase DVD of Creepshow stay with that, don't get the Blu-Ray because they are the exact same. DONT GET THE CREEPSHOW BLU-RAY!!!! By the way I recommend ordering if you can the Creepshow (2 Disc Special Edition)DVD from the UK.  It cost me about 13.08Pounds that's $21.00 US dollars, Get that 2 disc UK set if you can, it's amazing!!!!!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|One can enjoy this second of a three part trilogy even without the knowledge of book one, although it helps.  The history of world world one was covered in book one, this book takes the descendants of book one and follows them through world war two.  I sometimes confuse those with Russian names, but other than that, I thoroughly enjoy this book.

B002MQYOFW|2.0|It's an interesting concept, but feel that the vast differences in life style between district 1 and district 12 were too vast.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I don't get much down time but pinterest gives me things to think about. its a great way to get some awesome ideas!
B000K4WLXA|4.0|Aside from the outside box looking tattered, like it was used, the inside contents were all mint. It was all well.

B006BDHAX0|4.0|I'm new to playing Mahjong so I have had to really learn the game and go a lot slower than the average joe. I am starting to get through the first few levels in faster times now. I really feel that Mahjong can retrain your brain after injuries and lack of use due to laziness.  If you have any short-term memory issues you want to think about playing some of these games to exercise your brain.  I have and my memory is improving.  A year ago I couldn't play Mahjong at all. Now I can get through 3 levels without frustration.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have tried many similar app but after two months i settle with this one for good. it does every I wished for and more. I removed all other apps only to keep this one.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I play games on my phone and Kindle Fire HD to improve my memory and brain function. Angry Birds is one of my favorite. It also helps with eye-hand coordination.  If you have tremors like I do it can be difficult to play these type of games.  I have learned to slow down the tremors and actually enjoy the games.  A year ago my tremors were so bad that I couldn't play the games at all without really low scores. Now I am starting to get through many of the levels with 3 stars.  Fun game and I like the background music too  :)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Inspiring account of Navy Seal training, lifestyle and commitment to their group and their country.  Very well written with a lot of detail, but always interesting or exciting.  After reading this book, I have incredible respect for the Seals.  They provides examples of heroism and patriotism at a time when most of our leaders seem so shallow in comparison.  I'll wail a couple of weeks---then I'll read it again.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|My favorite album in years. SOOOOOO good.<br />Every song is a nice mix of mellow and ferocity.<br />I would recommend this album to anyone who appreciates good music.<br />The banjo or whatever little guitar work is outlandish.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love this game. it is a lot like diablo so if u like that u will like this. deff worth it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I really enjoy playing the game but it made my phone glitchy.  After the phone started shutting down on it's own I removed the app.  Now the phone is off and will not come back to life.  BEWARE!
B009P0K7JU|5.0|If the series and the season of Supernatural stays as strong as the first two episodes than viewers are in for a treat. Last week Supernatural put its pieces on the board with Dean returning from Purgatory, Cas missing and unaccounted for, Sam deserting a relationship in much the same way he deserted his responsibilities and Kevin, much stronger and more competent but angered and grieved at the murder of his girlfriend at the hands of Crowley, who is seeking to regain the new prophecy tablet that details how to close the gates of hell forever.<br /><br />Sam, Dean and Keving need to recover the tablet too and set off to do so after a brief detour to find Kevin's mother and put her someplace safe. But both Keven and Kevin's mother have other ideas and this leads the entire group to a very strange auction of magical artifacts. This auction is a great set-piece and has some Easter eggs in it from other favorites of the fantastic including Raiders of the Lost Ark and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br /><br />I won't give any more details of a wonderful episode except to say that we end with more complications than we started with but in a believeable and organic way. The viewer is also treated to more flashbacks of Dean's time in Purgatory, a storyline that is shaping up to be one of the most interesting ever, especially in light of the fact that we saw only the results of Dean's trip to hell. Highly recommended and I am more excited for a season of SPN than I have been since the apocalypse was coming. Highly recommended.<br /><br />As a final aside there is a great joke about Pluto being the God of Greed - a comment on the word plutocrat that has been so much a part of our political scene lately.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I am currently half way through this book and it is wonderful so far.  The writing is on par with her Harry Potter books.  I am enjoying this new topic and village she is taking me to.  I am certainly going to finish this novel and hopefully see many more from her.
B009LHWFLU|5.0|Review contains light spoilers.<br /><br />After some of the missteps of the last couple of season of Supernatural, I had my worries about what a new season would bring, but if the rest of Season 8 lives up to the premier, my worries will have been in vain. I loved the opening and the set-up of the season long arcs and the introduction of new characters.<br /><br />When we left Sam and Dean at the end of Season 7, Dean was in Purgatory and Cas had just disappeared, Kevin, the new prophet had been kidnapped by the always delightful Crowley, Bobby's soul had been set free in death and Sam was left all alone to find Dean, save Kevin and fight the Leviathons. It turns out that Sam did none of those things, a character choice that is sure to be controversial but that has some roots in past behavior and plots. Dean it seems may have been a very bad boy in Purgatory, a place he nicknamed Pure, no doubt because of the purity of the intent to survive that is necessary. It seems that in Purgatory, upon the disappearance of Cas, Dean teamed with a sexy, Southern vampire named Benny. Cas is dead or close enough to it to make no difference according to Dean and this forms the first mystery. Just what did happen to Cas and how did Dean get out of Pure? The viewer gets tantalizing glimpses of Dean and Benny's time in Purgatory via flashback.<br /><br />Kevin has grown a lot in the last year mostly because necessity is the mother of invention and desperation is the father of survival. Kevin was kidnapped by Crowley and shown another tablet to translate. How he escaped Crowley and begged Sam for help is also shown in flashback.<br /><br />Women, as always fare badly in the Supernatural universe with one death and one desertion in the first episode alone, but this seems to be the norm for Supernatural. Geekboys have no idea how to write realistic women or realistic relationships with women whether romantic or platonic, they can only do fantasy wish fulfillment (Dean's overwhemlming number of notches on his belt) or idealization of dead women (mom, Jessica, Meg, Jo, etc. etc. etc, the list is far too long) but idealization of dead women was good enough for Edgar Allen Poe, arguably one of the first nerd writers of the supernatural and fantastic so I suppose the writers are in good company here.<br /><br />All in all a great set-up to the season, including the character controversy and I look forward to see where the writers are going to take it.<br /><br />One last footnote, the Leviathan, those monsters whose weakness is a Victorian bug killer, are around but don't seem like they will be a focus for the season. Supernatural fans should check this out with no worries and newbies should start with the first season and catch-up. Recommended to fans of sci-fi and urban fantasy.umber of notches on his belt) or idealization of dead women (mom, Jessica, Meg, Jo, etc. etc. etc, the list is far too long) but idealization of dead women was good enough for Edgar Allen Poe, arguably one of the first nerd writers of the supernatural and fantastic so I suppose the writers are in good company here.<br /><br />All in all a great set-up to the season, including the character controversy and I look forward to see where the writers are going to take it.<br /><br />One last footnote, the Leviathan, those monsters whose weakness is a Victorian bug killer, are around but don't seem like they will be a focus for the season.

B0028NSE3M|3.0|I live in the san francisco bay area. but, I was in los angeles in 1973 when he featured this album in a stadium with approx. 30,000 people attending...when the \\"lock\\" dancers were the fad. their break dancing and their colorful clothes were the opening act for this man....A-N-D, when this HE came out on the stage OMG he was wrapped in chains.....OH BOY!!!!  fine!! strong mandingo!!!...\\"f-ing grand...man!\\"<br /><br />when I bought this CD recenty, I just expected more. along with this, I had bought 5 other  cds, to enjoy with all the other stuff I have already.<br /><br />I was driving to arizona to visit my dad. this CD lasted....12-15 mins, then repeated? seems like I had heard everything on the cd. sooo I paid attention....and listened....sorry..I was right...it just repeated. I needed more songs!<br /><br />I have gospel cd's that have 25 songs, james brown that has 12 and repeats 2-3, but that's okay. they still play 30-45 mins. I don't want to buy 3-4 cd's by this guy to get 30 mins. of music.<br /><br />again, what I heard was wonderful..just NOT what I wanted....OR...NOT enough of what I wanted!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is a page turner.  Wild  caused me to take a deeper look at my own life.  I am looking forward to my own hike along the Pacific Crest Trail.  A must read.

B008TMA1LY|4.0|Love this game but buying additional hearts is expensive. Very cute though. Just be prepared to shell out some cash if you want the best experience. 3,000 hearts will cost you twenty bucks!
B0027MJU00|5.0|A great mystery that keeps you guessing the whole time. Great characters, I loved the way she told the story from different characters point of view.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a good mind game for my grandchildren. it keeps the mind alert and moving. my grandchild grades has improved since he has been playing this game. I also have been hooked on this game. its fun for the whole family.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I was not impressed with the latest by Mitch Albom.  I have read his other books and thoroughly enjoyed them.  This was a strange book.  It was really different.  I don't think anyone else has come up with where time counting began.  You definately have to give him credit, he does have a vivid imagination.<br />The book did make me think about how much time I waste and how much I look at the clock during the day.  Don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Starting with a title sequence that would make Saul Bass proud, this film expertly weaves a tale involving characters that are so unusual and engaging that it just sets up a sense of mystery and anticipation that is not satisfied by one viewing. The soundtrack adds to the experience by being not a sound overlay but a sound texture that adds to the film experience in an almost subliminal manner. We only hope that Fincher will complete the trilogy.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Humans send out a space bound hello and welcome. Aliens send a crew to mop up humans and send a message home when it is done. The Navy is running games in the ocean near where the aliens land. Some of the ships are caught in an alien perimeter. One of the Navy men is a bit of a non-conformist which usually causes him problems. He gets extremely angry when the aliens kill his brother. He and the remaining Navy people, along with his g/f and a man who is learning to use artificial legs set about to make this raid on Earth as difficult, read here impossible, for the aliens as they can. There is a lot more to this movie than I have put here. This is just bare bones. It is an entertaining movie.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was curious to see how Rowling would make the jump to writing adult literature.<br />I loved the Harry Potter series, but The Casual Vacancy was a huge disappointment.<br />I had to force myself to stick with it to the end.  Characters were boring.  The story line was confusing.<br />Rowling struggled to make the plot of a \\"casual vacancy\\" worthy of a story.<br />Overall, not a fan.
B0098VXE50|4.0|and it should be. No light romp here. Serious, the queen wants her heart and will stop at nothing to get it. Snow wants to keep her heart where it is and will have to learn to fight for it. I enjoyed this movie even if it did have good fairies.  : )

0307346617|5.0|One of the best books i've read in a while. I think people of all ages will enjoy this, especially if you are interested in history or zombies.
B009B50QOU|3.0|I've been a huge fan of Green Day since the early 90's. You just can't go wrong with all the albums before \\"Warning\\". \\"Warning\\" was decent but \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"21st Century Breakdown\\" weren't too good, so I wasn't too excited for this. But I checked it out and was pleasantly surprised. It had somewhat of an old Green Day feel to it, so that made me happy. I liked all but \\"Kill the DJ\\" and \\"Troublemaker\\" which I thought were absolutely awful songs. \\"Nuclear Family\\" being the best. Overall, it was alright but give me \\"Dookie\\", \\"Insomniac\\", \\"Kerplunk\\", \\"39 Smooth\\" and \\"Nimrod\\" over this anyday.<br />I'm not too thrilled for \\"Dos\\" because from what I've heard so far, it's pretty bad.
B007PFDJH4|2.0|I ordered this book on reading the many glowing reviews and since McEwan's books were new to me I thought I'd give him a try.  Unfortunately after the first few chapters I was totally bored.  The novel moves along at a very slow pace, the characters are unsympathetic and the plot is weak to put it mildly.  Nothing much of interest happens.  It feels like the author is so impressed by his own intelligence that his writing comes across as a literary lecture devoid of emotion.  I must admit the plot twist at the end is clever but comes too late to make up for the previous 300 or so pages.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love books like this.  I love that feeling of giving in to my addiction and delving into a story headfirst with utter abandon.  Losing all sense of time and place.  Knowing that I must keep reading, must keep going, must know how this story ends and I don't care to eat, sleep or converse until it's finished.  Appointments for the day cancelled or forgotten.  It's like getting lost in a portal of some sort and so rare to find those books that do that for me.<br /><br />In this second installment of the trilogy, Christian and Ana continue their relationship, though without signing 'the document' that will spell out her complete submission to him--mind, body and soul.  Ana seems willing to but wants to haggle over the details.  Christian just can't seem to wait.<br /><br />This book was darker than the first one, as the title suggest--the darker side of addiction, the darker side of lust and a realization, for Ana, that loving Christian will mean accepting his past as their present reality.  Is Christian too damaged for redemption, too broken for repair?<br /><br />I truly liked this one even better than the first.  It was filled with more delicious surprises.  I can hardly wait to inhale that last book!
B007THA4FI|2.0|The writing was wonderful. The story was not. I found it to be dull and could not care about the characters. I had to force myself to finish it.
B007R6X9IK|4.0|It is very difficult to write an album that is inspirational, spiritual and religious. Bob \\"Dylan\\" Zimmerman has said it is ten times harder than creating an album about life as we see it. I can understand his point and it's clear when you listen to this marvelous recording by the Soulsavers. It's difficult because some times it comes off as preaching.....not on this album, however. Soulsavers pull it off,but it's not easy. I have many of their albums and this one is the first that really could be labeled \\"religious\\" or totally spiritual. This is also the first album with Dave Gahan as lead singer and songwriter. The other albums used the great Mark Lanegan as lead singer. Gahan has a clear, powerful and at times soaring vocal style. The background vocals are superb.<br /><br />This is a well produced, well sung and played, inspirational album that strives to connect with the life force beyond mankind to a higher plateau of awareness and appreciation of just exactly what we are. It strives to create a mood of humbleness and thankfulness for our very lives. We're on this planet spinning and traveling through space among the stars and we know only one thing for certain....we will die, everyone of us. What is the meaning of that? What is the meaning of this existence. The realization of these questions and facts should make us better people.....that's what Soulsavers are trying to convey, I believe.<br /><br />That's the light that Hank was singing about and the \\"light the dead can see.....\\"
B009LZH5AI|5.0|I did not start watching the series until the end of the second season...then my Thursday nights changed for our entire household and friends! I had to catch up with the complete history of the show. Then I shared with my husband and daughter. I had to buy 3 copies of the previous seasons and sent them  my sons who were both outside of the US working in Iraq and Afghanistan (plus complete series for my niece). Thank you to a show that makes intelligence a good thing! I hate shows that make women under appreciated and makes farting something to laugh about. I have never found the humor in that! Thanks to math, science, history and HUMOR Big Bang Style!!!!!!!!!!!!
030758836X|4.0|As I read this book - I literally kept thinking 'wow, my five year anniversary is right around the corner....'<br /><br />You want to root for Amy, you want to root for Nick - and then everything starts.  One reason I liked this book - you get the perspective from both main characters - a day to day from Nick, and one from Amy.  We get to see the progression they didn't see.<br /><br />I found this to be an entertaining story - I do agree with some reviewers that the end felt odd - I had to re-read the last page to make sure I didn't miss something-it just ended without some big and grand - which I had come to expect after reading.<br /><br />I would recommend this book - if nothing else, go hug your spouse today.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun! It is kind of annoying that you have to earn points to open new levels.....but its def a fun app!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was really excited to read this book. I love the Harry potter series and JK Rowling is by far my favorite author. I downloaded it and at midnight I checked to see if I had received it. Had to wait til morning. Part of me likes the book. The plot of the book was hard to grasp, I know her writing style is to describe everything and in certain genres it works. I plan to reread this book at a later date so I can hopefully understand it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Just change the date manually-presto!! time to level up.  The limit would keep me from wasting my day, but it is oddly entertaining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book was full off fire and excitement, this book is a little less so, but still a great read. it really develops the story further and gets you ready for the next book. cant wait to see what happens next!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I had never been one to jump on the new trilogy bandwagon, but i was convinced by a good  friend. Just Awedome!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I like the app for wasting time when I am bored...but it likes to stop working and then I need to force it closed. Not annoying enough to make me stop using it though.

B007THA4FI|4.0|... an array of characters with a multitude of conflicts... it boils down to the story of Krystal Weeden. It is plain to see Rowling's keen interest in needy children. The ending of this novel ... the funeral ... is perhaps the best I have ever read. What a tribute to a courageous girl!!!
B000002KGT|5.0|If you truly loved rock music and fairly graded the top albums of ALL time RUMOURS should be at the top of everyones list. I had the pleasure of seeing this legendary band perform a few times and they absolutely did not disappoint. My favorite was their performance at The World Series of Rock at the old Cleveland Stadium. This album is an artwork, a true masterpiece of rock n' roll history buy it and cherish it.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am not even going to try to describe it. Just read it. It is the best book in the series so far. It is.....I dont KNOW. Just read it. You have to. You are obligated to read this book.
B00009V8XX|1.0|I like this fun romp and saw a reasonably priced copy, so thought I'd add it to my dvd library.  Unfortunately I misread or was misled into buying a version that I think will only play in Europe.  It certainly won't play in the USA.  I'll throw it in with a relative's Xmas gift as a bonus.  Maybe they'll get some use out of it. I certainly won't.  Too bad.  It's a rather sweet take on the genre if I remember correctly.  Not as perfect as 'The Professional', but fun none-the-less as the middle-aged protagonist tries to balance his tricky crime connections with instant fatherhood.
0061537969|5.0|This is a great book from beginning to end, written in \\"First person Dog\\", it's very believable as it is well written. I have purchased and sent out 6 different copies of this book to dog lover friends of mine and they all loved it as well.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Game play is easy to understand, and controls are easy to use.  Graphics aren't amazing, but they give the game a fun look.  The game is one of the best I have played.
B007THA4FI|5.0|A former 5th grade teacher, I always enjoyed sharing the newest Potter books informally with my students and loved watching them use what they'd read about in the Potter repertoire; as one student (who'd been reluctant to read the books just because everyone else was reading them) said when she dropped her pencil on the floor,\\"Levioso!\\"<br /><br />Knowing fully well that this is a novel for adults, I selected it because of the way Rowling uses language. Her descriptions, dialogue, and characterizations fulfill the \\"Ah!\\" that is missing reading books by authors less facile with the art of putting words together.  Rowling has the magic of language that propels her storyline beautifully.  There are so many instances where I stop and reread a section just because of the way she worded it and the way it flows so gently to the next thought.<br /><br />I will preorder and read her next offering as well, no matter what the subject matter.  She's a gifted wordsmith with an unlimited imagination.
B000FC1HQY|5.0|This memoir, Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, is a heart-wrenching account of Alexandra Fuller's childhood in Africa.  Shortly after her birth in England, Alexandra's family moves to Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe.)  Her family lives a life in constant motion, moving from farm to farm in order to keep their living as tobacco farmers.  They live a life of constant hardships, attempting to fit in while Africa is filled with conflict and facing discrimination due to their European heritage.  Alexandra struggles with her identity, for even though she identifies herself as an African, her technical ethnicity prevents her from ever blending in in the very land where she spends the majority of her life.<br />  Reading this memoir was a very moving experience, and I loved Alexandra Fuller's writing style.  Her story is very emotional, and she perfectly conveyed these deep emotions.  I was able to step into Alexandra's shoes, and as a result the story became even more heartbreaking.  She uses amazing details, and the whole thing feels so real, such as one of the tumultuous scenes when Alexandra says that her everything is \\"a terrifying, unhinged blur and I cannot determine whether it is me, or the world that is of its axis.\\"  Her world spins out of control during the story, and throughout its entirety I felt like I was spiraling down along with her.  I would like to be able to recommend this book to everyone, however, it is slightly intense and would be best read by high schoolers and up.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Oh Mumford, you always know how to speak to the soul, and you sound fantastic doing it. The more you listen to Mumford & Sons, the more you love them. Their lyrics are always phenomenal, and their musical talent is incredible. I just saw them live in Aspen, and the band frequently rotates who is on what instrument. Such an impressive group, and an amazing contribution to modern music.
B008XG1X18|5.0|its just as good as the full website. I am using this constantly.  maybe even too much :) love it
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love being able to use my kindle fire to play on Pinterest. However, the app repeatedly force closes and that is very irksome! Get that fixed and this could be 5 stars.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|I have used this knife to baton, chop and strip bark from seasoned hardwood, slice an apple, etc. - works great for everything. I think the laminated structure would make the knife extremely difficult to break - the slightly different matrices of the different pieces of steels against each other would I think (not an engineer) dampen harmonic (?) vibration and would probably prevent a crack from propagating if one were to develop. I also have a Fallkniven A1 but don't like it any better. I have a lot of other knives, too (ESEE, Busse, kabar) and I like most of them but for what it is worth, i seem to be carrying the San Mai srk the most lately.  I think this is a great knife for the money.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett is a master story teller. His ability to weave historical facts into the lives of families from such different backgrounds never fails to amaze me.Once I started the book I couldn't put it down. I love the way he brings the different characters together and how much you care about what happens to them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing. It is easier than the version on the iphone since the bigger screen. This game is 10000000 times better than block story and way worth the money.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|As a Michael Connelly fan I was pleased to see a new title available.  In Mulholland Drive there are three short stories which are inventive and worth reading.  The three take about 1/2 of the book, the other half is a teaser for a new, not yet released book by Connelly.  I wish that was clear in the Amazon blurb about the book but alas it wasn't.  I don't like to read teasers preferring to wait until I can get immediate satisfaction by reading the whole work at one time.  In other words I enjoyed the 3 short stories and then felt disappointed that the balance of the book was essentially an ad.
B0091THRCU|3.0|I've been putting this case through its paces the past few weeks. Here are my impressions:<br /><br />Snugg is an apt name as this case holds the phone well. The card slot is not as useful as I thought, as it can be nigh impossible to get a card out when your phone is in the case too. I usually have to take my phone out before I can take the card out, which is annoying.<br /><br />The case looks good and has that black leathery look, even though it's not really genuine leather. The stitching around the edges has held up well. The pull-tab you use to get the phone out is well-made, and I like the little hidden magnet used to hold it in place (though the \\"click\\" noise it makes when the tab hits the magnet can sound awfully loud when you're in place you have to be quiet, like a class or library).<br /><br />A few cons--The leather around the edges of the hole where the pull-tab goes into the case has begun to fray and peel back a little. Also, the chemical smell has lessened significantly from when I first took it out of its packaging, but it's still there if I take a whiff.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad case. It's affordable and you get what you pay for. But if you can afford a better upmarket real leather case, I say go for it. Sena makes some nice cases.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|This book is advertised as being about the mission that killed Bin Laden. It does finally get around to that after spending most of the book describing the life of a Navy Seal. Don't get me wrong- that was interesting, but not what I expected.
B007WA10IW|5.0|even today never mind the bollocks has too be one of the greatest cds ever.  the only thing that could top it is the 2012 re-mastered version. the anger,the passion,and the powerful lyrics now are alot clearer and louder.  the original yellow uk cover is used instead of the usa pink. even if you have the original on cd or album, a fan of the pistols or punk rock this is a must for your collection

B009NQKPUW|5.0|I didn't get a chance to go see this at the movies, so, when I had the chance to see it on amazon I jumped on it. I already have all the Alien movies on my terabyte so I just wanted to make sure this was up to \\"Alien\\" par and I would put this as better than all the movies after \\"Aliens.\\" Maybe this should have been the sequel to \\"Aliens\\" if they didn't blow up the planet or a side adventure that goes on while the Nostromo is having its problems...I'm not sure.<br /> I think this movie is an awesome peek into \\"Chariots of the Gods\\". This movie is very well put together, from its ancient writing (Klaus Dona) to the Engineers attitude, and even how the engineers look is on the money. I research the Annunaki and I will say that I am glad it was eaten by the octopus-alien thing.<br /> Overall I had a great time and even felt nostalgic seeing the dirt bag android doing the same thing.<br /> Have fun watching this if you do its great.
0345803485|1.0|Whiny protaganist, juvenile writing, redundant descriptions of inane details, no chemistry between characters, with nauseating acts trying come across as intimate or romantic.

B003CN4R74|5.0|This album by Evanescence is full of energy. Amy Lee's voice is fantastic. I can't wait for her next album.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Let's admit it: I was a bit sceptic and anxious (as another reviewer was) after hearing the samples on Amazon. Having been a Kiss fan for 34 years now, I am glad that my first impression did not stand the test. This album is just awesome!! From the very first listen, \\"Monster\\" offered me about the same shock as the latest studio effort by Motörhead (\\"The World is Yours\\"). And the new Kiss release continues to grow on me with time. Pure music, raw sound, just heavy rock' n' roll.<br /><br />Is \\"Monster\\" a mix of \\"Destroyer\\" and \\"Revenge\\"?<br /><br />I don't bother anyway. But OK. Let's play the game... even if it's always difficult to compare Kiss with other Kiss material, given the changes in musicians, producers and fashions over time. This is no \\"Creatures\\" (my all times' favorite), no \\"Lick It Up\\", no \\"Destroyer\\" (except perhaps for the catchy choruses here and there). This new album is very close in sound and design to \\"Revenge\\" certainly... On the other hand, \\"Monster\\" is no \\"Sonic Boom\\" and this IS good news: although \\"Sonic Boom\\" was -say- a fair album, it never managed to move or thrill me. I think I hardly listened to it more than four or five times (still tried once recently and was not impressed yet). Don't know why... Probably too much of a pre-conceived (would I dare to say: \\"concept\\"?) album (\\"Let's do 'Rock' n' Roll Over' again!\\" - What for? I own the original and it's not the best piece in my Kiss collection). Too polished, too tame. Not as spontaneous and fresh as this one... Yes, \\"Monster\\" is way better: it's an energizer. This album is probably what \\"Animalize\\" or \\"Asylum\\" would have been like, had they fully succeeded. What's this then? Well it could be that \\"Monster\\" is finally ... just \\"Monster\\"! A new and fresh approach to (very) good music. Next time, be sure, \\"Monster\\" will be a point of reference and lots of us will moan and groan because the next album is... something else (which looks as a good thing to me, since repeating the same old tricks over and over again is useless).<br /><br />What about the players?<br /><br />Has Gene ever sounded better than on this album (I mean: both the voice and the bass)? Not sure... Where have we heard so clearly Eric's drum pulse (hear \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" and learn)? Tommy? Well, this is probably Tommy's album as stated by another reviewer. His guitar really shines and delivers on this one, and he manages to part from Ace's gimmicks and trademark (only a few lookalikes for those who like them, mostly on \\"Take Me Down below\\"). There are also one or two echoes of... Vinnie Vincent, which (yes!) IS good news to me. In the end, it's just Tommy sounding like... Tommy! And Paul? He probably never produced a record as brilliantly as this one, and he still proves to be able to sing his heart out (on \\"Freak\\" or \\"Long Way Down\\", amongst others).<br /><br />The songs?<br /><br />There are only two of them that I could consider as fillers. Although I'm not 100% sure yet, since they might grow on me with time and listens: \\"Shout Mercy\\" and -sadly- the final one \\"Last Chance\\". I very much regret that \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" is not on the CD. From what I heard, it could have been a better ending for this great album. As for the rest, everything is brilliant, each song from \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" to \\"Take Me Down Below\\" fighting in its own category (this album is NOT at all boring, whereas \\"Sonic Boom\\" was repetitive). My personal favorites -to name only four- are \\"Freak\\" (ever noticed the echo from \\"Thief in the Night\\"?), \\"The Devil is Me\\" (Gene's chant at its best), \\"Outta This World\\" (sounds as \\"Into the Void\\" but is definitely another animal), and \\"Long Way Down\\" (the only true newborn of \\"Creatures\\" and \\"Lick It Up\\": remember \\"Keep Me Coming\\" and -maybe- \\"All Hell's Breakin' Loose\\"). I also very much enjoy \\"All For The Love Of Rock & Roll\\", which I do not find too similar to the Tuff Darts song of the same title (see reference in Mr Blackwell's review on Amazon.uk, which ismuch revelant anyway, as always). What I hear is son of Status Quo and Creedence: there could be a worse legacy!!<br /><br />Thanks Kiss for offering this to your fans, thanks for staying incredible musicians, and thanks Paul for the excellent job on the production.<br /><br />Now, forget the samples (by the way: AND the cover...), get the album and let it blow your speakers out!!

B00005JNJV|5.0|Ha! I am the 1500th review of this movie! Me: 1, Rest of the World: 0<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy. I enjoyed all three films immensely, but this was my favorite. I think I am probably in a minority there. It is always difficult to compare films even when they are by the same director and have the same subject. There are certainly things that I liked better about [[ASIN:B001GZ6QDS The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B004LWZWGK The Dark Knight Rises (Blu-ray/DVD Combo+UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] (I intend, eventually, to write reviews of both). Both of The Dark Knight films had more interesting villains.<br /><br />The reason I still consider this my favorite of the three is because there is literally nothing I would change about this film. That is extremely rare for me. I tend to nitpick even my favorite films, and I almost always find little things I do not like, or that I wish were different. I can honestly say, with this film, that even if Christopher Nolan had come to me with an advanced screening and asked me if I had any suggestions for changes to be made (and frankly I am somewhat put out that he did not) I would have had no suggestions to offer.<br /><br />The movie, of course, charts the rise of Batman. It has been said many times already, by many other people, but I think it is an important point so I will say it again, what separates this movie from most super hero movies, as well as all the Batman movies made before Nolan's trilogy, is that Christopher Nolan has attempted to create a realistic world, as opposed to a cartoonish world, and he has succeeded brilliantly. It is amazing to me that so few super hero movies are able to achieve this degree of realism (most do not even try). It is always necessary in any super hero movie (or any other movie actually) to suspend disbelief to some degree, but this movie gets about as close as possible to a genuinely realistic super hero movie.<br /><br />The acting is superb throughout, and there is a whole host of supporting characters that each add their particular flavor to the whole movie. This is one of Christopher Nolan's genuine talents it seems to me. All of these Batman movies are filled with genuinely interesting, well drawn, and superbly acted, supporting characters. I said that the two Dark Knight movies had better villains, but the villains in this movie are actually very well played, and interesting. The addition of The Scarecrow was one of the highlights of this film for me. And, of course, Alfred (Michael Caine), Sergeant Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are all spectacular. I also think Katie Holmes did a very good job as Rachel Dawes. All of the pieces of the jigsaw really came together on this one.<br /><br />It is easy to look down on super hero movies. I think they generally play into our human-all-too-human desires for perfect justice, or our desire to feel empowered in the face of things that we feel powerless about, but this movie has some substance. The movie analyzes, to some degree, the role that fear plays in perpetuating conditions that people find undesirable. This is a genuine insight into the way the world works. Batman is not out, in this movie, to single-handedly end all crime, or stop some cartoonish super villain. Batman's goal is to empower the citizens of Gotham, who are paralyzed by fear, and to turn that fear around on those doing the terrorizing (to make sure his enemies \\"share his dread\\").<br /><br />The movie also has somewhat of a social conscience in the form of Rachel Dawes and Bruce Wayne's father, as well as Bruce Wayne himself. There are a group of people who are willing to take advantage of people's fear, and the social problems of Gotham, for the sake of profit (like Carmine Falcone and The Scarecrow), but there is also a sense that many of the criminals of Gotham are being forced into crime through desperation. The movie has, therefore, some moralcomplexity, and is not quite the standard good guy/bad guy super hero film that we are used to, particularly when one takes into account the fact that the main villain, Ra's al Ghul, is acting on \\"good intentions\\". In fact, one could argue, that Ra's al Ghul adopts the position adopted by most super hero movies: that criminals are criminals because they are evil, and cannot be reformed, so the only thing to do is simply wipe them out. Batman represents a more subtle, and more complex, moral standpoint since he believes in reforming conditions as opposed to simply getting the \\"bad guys\\".<br /><br />Those are just a few of the reasons this is one of my all time favorite movies. I think you should watch it.complexity, and is not quite the standard good guy/bad guy super hero film that we are used to, particularly when one takes into account the fact that the main villain, Ra's al Ghul, is acting on \\"good intentions\\".

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Tough's book provides an accessible and enjoyable run through some of the latest research on why children succeed, or, more importantly, why some (usually poor kids) don't. As someone who studies this area professionally, I was impressed by the breadth of research covered and the nuance with which Tough handles it (with a few exceptions). Mixing journalistic profiles and coverage with scientific research, Tough does an excellent job weaving together themes and patterns in the field of child development. If you're a fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books, I would recommend this highly as it moves past airport-popular press to a deliver some real stories about what's happening with American kids.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I believe Ms. Rowling should stick with Harry Potter. Her plot line in the new book seems contrived and rather provincial. I had trouble maintaining interest and could only read a few pages at a sitting, whereas with a book that interests me I can read about 100 pages at a sitting. I also had trouble empathizing with her characters.
B008G12EUY|4.0|This Album is definitely a change for Muse, about half of it is upbeat and the other half is slower paced and melodic with some electronic and dubstep inspiration. That said, I loved it and in my opinion it's a natural evolution from The Resistance.<br /><br />Here's my review of each track:<br /><br />1. Supremacy - This is my personal favorite on the album, it's got that classic Muse sound and in an unprofessional term, \\"Dat riff\\". It has a tough sounds similar to something you would hear off of Black Holes and Revelations and is comparable to Uprising from The Resistance with a James Bond twist. 10/10<br /><br />2. Madness - The second single from the album, this features an electronic \\"dubstep-esque\\" bass line and a killer Queen-like solo. The first time I heard it on the radio I wasn't a huge fan but it's grown on me since and now that I've heard it with the rest of the album it fits well. 8.5/10<br /><br />3. Panic Station - This features a bass line similar to Another One Bites the Dust by Queen, it also contains a couple Queen-like vocal parts. This song is a funk/rock masterpiece that I love through and through. Did I mention this is Matt's first F-bomb on any Muse album? 9/10<br /><br />4. Prelude - You may have heard this along with Survival at a couple Muse shows, I think they played this at the Olympics this year. It's basically what it says in the title, a prelude to Survival. Very symphonic and fits nicely with the next track. 8.5/10<br /><br />5. Survival - Muse's first single from this album. Not my favorite, not my least favorite. I do love the build and it features yet another Queen-sounding solo. It's a different yet somewhat familiar sound for Muse. 8/10<br /><br />6. Follow Me - The first slowish song on the album. Focused primarily on vocals at the beginning until the synth comes in and then Dom's drumming which, in my opinion, steals the song. Dom is a great drummer and the open sound to his drumming in this is great, the song is awesome andI dig the '80s meets modern sound it bears. 8/10<br /><br />7. Animals - Yet another slowish song. Opens with some organ and bluesy George Harrison/Eric Clapton inspired guitar improvisations. It's a cool song and one of my favorites on the album, you can really hear the Stratocaster Matt uses shine. Guitar focused and nicely written. It definitely has a cool build at the end with some more classic Muse sounding riffs. 9/10<br /><br />8. Explorers - Very much like something Freddie Mercury would write. Lots of keys, orchestra, and some nice Beatles-sounding guitar. 8.5/10<br /><br />9. This is very much like a U2 song. Kind of goofy sounding at parts but not necessarily a bad song. It's a fun listen but for sure is my least favorite on the album. It has a lot of cool little things that I love about it though, the triplet hits on the drums, the upbeat picking on guitar, a solo that reminds me of what The Edge would sound like if he were good, and some cool harmonies. Worth a listen and not something that I skip when listening to this album which is good considering it's my least favorite. 8/10<br /><br />10. Save Me - A Chris-written song led by none other than Chris. Another slower song that has this crazy atmospheric and epic sound to it. It's got an eerie yet beautiful sound and I absolutely love it. Chris's vocals remind me of Brian Bell's (Weezer) and I absolutely love the Muse/Weezer/Dream Theater sound. 9/10<br /><br />11. Liquid State - Holy Crap. Liquid State is another Chris-written/performed song that is quite epic. This is a great semi-closer with more of that \\"Classic Muse\\" Riffing and writing style. It's a rough-sounding song that can simply be called a Muse song. 9.5/10<br /><br />12. The 2nd Law: Unsustainable - This song is awesome. (Keep in mind I'm in no way a dubstep fan). It's like taking a scientific law, throwing in some Elfman Spider-man music, and a nice electronic/dubstepish breakdown with some killer guitar technique. Muse shine as diverseartists on this track. 9/10<br /><br />13. The 2nd Law: Isolated System - Take the recently stated elements of Unsustainable, remove the Spidey music, throw in some creepy sounding instrumentation, and take out a little bit of the dubstep. A cool outro song that definitely leaves a good taste in your mouth. 8.5/10<br /><br />DVD: Fun to watch, lots of footage, great length, and some funny parts. This was in no way disappointing and exceeded my expectations. Well done Muse. 9.5/10<br /><br />Overall this album is great. It's a Muse album for sure but has elements of Queen, U2, Dream Theatre, Dubstep in general, and a little Red Album. Even with the inspirations from other bands this is a Muse album for sure. Starts epic and ends satisfyingly. A natural progression form The Resistance.<br /><br />Over all rating: 9/10

B004132I4S|5.0|The first time I listened to this I was a bit disappointed with Sufjan.  This was premature.  As is the case with most of his work, listening to this album multiple times will mold the listener into liking it, which is the sign of true genius.
0062202081|5.0|Justin's new book was absolutely breathtaking & I loved every word of it. It was everything & more than I expected!!! OHH! & I loved all of the photos too & I felt even closer to him then I already did(: I will be a belieber forever & always<3 Obviously, this journey has just began!!!<3
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book has very little relation the Harry Potter ones.  It is very good on its own.  Clearly this was a story she felt she had to tell and I am glad that I read it.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This was an interesting game, but it didn't \\"addict\\" me like it did others. It ran well on the fire and it was fairly enjoyable.
B006OAB3ME|3.0|I bought \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" after seeing a PBS program about how it was made.  While I enjoyed the songs, which were old favorites, I thought the presentation was lacking in diversity.  They all sounded the same.
0307346617|5.0|Brilliant book.  Terrifically researched.  An absolutely genius collection of snapshot stories taken from the history of the \\"Zombie War\\".  Not a collection of how people managed to hack and slash \\"Zack\\" to bloody bits.  Instead, it's an inspired anthology of character studies and a social statement on the human condition in the real life here and now.  Turns out, it's not really a book about zombies; but a book about you uncle Jim, and about the pharmacological industrialist, and the pampered celebrity, and the amoral transplant doctor operating in South America, and the suburban housewife and mother, and every other everyday, flawed human being caught in bizarre circumstances which either temper or break them.  One of the most thoughtful and considered \\"what ifs\\" I've ever read.
B005D67OLE|5.0|excellent as usual, Dexter is always a sight for sore eyes. Dexter will rule the airs and bring joy to the masses
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Second time I have seen this movie.  It is heartwarming, sensitive,and a movie<br />I believe all should watch.  The true meaning of love and loyalty, between<br />a dog and his owner.  Good lesson for all.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Very challenging, engrossing game. A little slow at first, but if you can't get the right numbers to add up to the AWEsum, the blocks can stack up before you know it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was very unsure about purchasing these books, because most of the ratings were not good. The whole story line is great, I found myself not able to put the books down. They are well worth the money and read...enjoy!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Game is entertaining, but frequent advertising which requires interaction to close is a constant distraction.  I would recommend this game to try
B004YM6JP0|4.0|If you like teen drama and suspense, this is a great show to watch. It's got it all: Forbidden love, love triangles, etc. It also has a lot of supernatural suspense with creatures like werewolves, witches, ghost, etc. And have I mentioned that the show has vampires that don't glow in the sunlight? Yeah. Real vampires. Make sure to pick a copy if you haven't already.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I am totally in love with Ms Katniss Everdeen.  While the movie was showing in Malaysia, I saw it a total of 5x at the cinema! While it may not be the same as the book version ( hunger games by Suzanne Collins) I think it's just as good. Definitely a keeper for fans of strong independent ladies! Go girl power!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|For a jack reacher novel i could put the book down and pick up when i had nothing  better  to do l give a rating of three stars.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|A pretty bland interpretation of the source material sans the inner monologue that really MADE Batman a character. Alot of the staging was flat and coincidentally so were the majority of vocal performances. I feel like Peter Weller went in to the booth and they just used his first take on every line.<br /><br />In a cartoon you expect things to be amped up just a little bit, this felt more like a storyboard with how little things actually moved and how flat every composition was. I think the \\"Legends of the Dark Knight\\" episode of Batman: TAS did a much better job of interpreting the source material.<br /><br />That said, if you've never read the comic, this is probably going to be at least mildly enjoyable. I'm glad I rented and didn't buy. I'd suggest you do the same. Enjoy!
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I bought this DVD because of all the amazingly positive reviews and was mightily disappointed. Well, the show IS grand, it is very expensive, too. The voices are excellent. Incredible cast. But the music seems to be same old, same old, no sense of novelty or invention. The only two pieces that were truly amazing is the opening scene - the Phantom solo and the theme title song - Love Never Dies. This is actually the climax everything leads to. After that there is nothing to anticipate any more.<br /><br />The plot is absolutely lame. It in many ways feels like Mamma Mia - a musical, where the creators had to add some kind of subject line, however corny, to pull together brilliant pieces of music. Well, just like I said - there is not much music brilliancy in Love Never Dies and the plot is totally worthless. Besides, it robs the original musical of its meaning if you take this new creation as a sequel. Some people say that one should't view it this way, but then why did not the authors simply make a musical about another Phantom at another place rather than including old familiar characters into the story line making good people villains and so on. I am not sure.<br /><br />I believe it is the actual production - that is so well done - that made the show a success Down Under. All the money poured into it, the overwhelming costumes and scenery would not leave anyone unimpressed if seen live.<br /><br />Well, I might be the only one so disappointed that I even had to fast forward through some boring and monotonous music pieces. But there is this opinion, and I am the official collector of this DVD. So I guess this opinion has the right to exist. So maybe it will be helpful for some hesitant buyers. I would advise - try to borrow and see it first and then decide what you think and whether this is worth owning.
B0074V33MK|5.0|When I saw the recent news that the author of this book had passed away there was of course a bio of Mr. Lomax. I was compelled to buy his book. There are several stories of his torture, and the torture of the other POW's around him that are difficult to read, let alone imagine...e incomprehensible suffering of the victims of war needs to be remembered over and over again in order to AVOID conflict at all costs. May he rest in peace.
0525953728|5.0|This book gives an incredibly moving account of what it's like to be a Navy Seal and the reader cannot help but be amazed at how lucky we are to have them fighting for us.  It was clear how devastating it is to lose even one Seal, let alone 28 at one time, because they are such a unique breed.<br /><br />As the writer states, this is not a political book; however, he does explain the difficulty of cutting through the bureaucratic red tape to get approval for this mission.  And, it's VERY clear that the Seals were responsible for the success of this mission and NOT the President.  Credit needs to be given where credit's due, because once the reader sees what these Seals go through on a daily basis, he/she will totally understand why no one else should take credit for anything they do.  Every American owes a huge debt of gratitude to the Seals, and it's heartbreaking to know we have a government that would prosecute any of them for anything ever, because I suspect our life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness would have been greatly diminished without the work of the Seals.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I am definitely not a musical type of girl, but I saw this movie last night and was SO surprised at how much I loved it! I didn't want it to end. It was hilarious on so many levels, from so many different characters. Every character made a funny at multiple points, haha. I don't think it was the typical corny kind of musical. It's just a feel good movie and the songs that were chosen were great. I decided just a few minutes after it ended that I'm going to buy it on DVD. It's definitely good for a good laugh!
0316228532|3.0|After reading a number of the early reviews on this, I approached it with trepidation.<br /><br />Most of the reviewers seemed to have hit the novel's weak points on the head: overlong, some meandering passages, not a lot going on for most of its length and a lot of characters to keep track of, all of them unlikeable. However, the reviewers also said that the book picks up in the second half and they were correct about that as well. I hung in there and at about the 60% mark the novel finally became engrossing as the characters began to act out on their previously internalized hostilities toward one another. Payback is always fun and interesting. The ending was satisfying if not wonderful, and did tie up loose ends.<br /><br />If you're a devoted fan of the author, you may want to give this a try. It is well written, though some stricter editing was in order, which is the same way I felt about the last three Potter novels. Just keep in mind that you are going to have to get through 300 pages to get to the \\"good part\\" and you will be in the company of some really terrible people during that time.
0240815807|5.0|This book will change the way you listen to and understand what you're hearing. The book is easily understood, and audio examples are given to help you distinguish what you hear from what you shouldn't. It clearly explains what you'll need (from before getting equipment, to what to do with it once you have it) to get your productions to sound commercially competitive at an affordable budget. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone looking to learn this as a passion or even just a hobby. It's informative, easily explained, and backed up by industry elite producers and engineers. Great buy!
B0053O8ARI|5.0|This is my absolutely favorite show from the last season, and was over the moon when it was announced for dvd AND BluRay. I have received my copy and can happily report the BluRay is region free so you can play it in Europe as well. Thank you WB!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|its a really cool game if you like violent killing games and don't mind weapons and some blood with a little tiny bit of Gore
B007THA4FI|1.0|I may not be fair to the author by rating this book so soon.  I am 45 pages into the book and am quickly losing interest.  If it doesn't pick up soon I will be extremely disappointed in the authors writings on this book.  I shall continue on and hopefully it will get more interesting.
B0083VP2KQ|4.0|Planet Dinosaur is a very good documentary, in a six episode format a la Walking With Dinosaurs, covering some of the most important finds of the last 20 or so years.<br /><br />The first episode covers the three superpredators of Mid Cretaceous Africa - Spinosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus and the crocodilian Sarcosuchus (a/k/a SuperCroc), which remarkably coexisted together.  The second episode covers some of the more important feathered dinosaurs of Asia which have changed the way we look at dinosaurs.  The third episode profiles Daspletosaurus and Majungasaurus as representatives of the two major predator groups that dominated the Late Cretaceous worldwide.  Episode four takes a look at two Jurassic predators - the sea monster Predator X and the domination of Allosaurus by it's less prolific but larger relative Saurophaganax (stay tuned for further scientific news regarding whether or not it's actually not a separate species but rather an oversized Allosaurus).  Episode 5 profiles the sauropods Argentinosaurus and Paralititan, two contenders for the largest dinosaur ever found.  The series wraps up jumping around to examine several lesser known dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous.<br /><br />There are a few instances where the CGI seemed evident to me, but all in all there were alot of quite memorable images.  A few of the dinosaurs have already been covered in other documentaries, but there are also a few long overdue debuts.  Camptosaurus, a mid-sized herbivore which appeared in almost every kid's dino book back in the day but is probably not quite as well known by today's kids, finally shows up after having been inexplicably omitted from Walking With's Jurassic episode and Allosaurus spinoff.  Chasmosaurus, my choice for the most beautiful horned dinosaur, makes a full appearance after having only shown up, to my knowledge, in a brief section of the Bizarre Dinosaurs special covering Ceratopsian headgear.  The highlight of the set might be the elegant potential death race (flight?) between China's Microraptor and Sinornithosaurus, a surprisingly creepy and nasty little predator.<br /><br />A must have for any dino fan.

B0068THAGY|2.0|This movie started off good, it was really interesting and engaging for at least the first half or more! Then it started to show a very typical pattern of predictability and although the actors did a good job the story I lost interest with and I was not a fan of the ending.  Some may like it, I watched because it had good reviews but I was not impressed and can now say I've seen it but will probably never watch it again.
0525953728|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  Personally, I think the author had the backing of every member of seal team six.  They wanted their story told with no left or right twist on the facts.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I am so mad that I spent $12.99 on this book. I have had to re read the first 20 pages several times and still can't get into it. Save your money and frustration and go buy two or three enjoyable books.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found this book to be a very good reference for anyone who would like to publish for the first time on Kindle.<br />Good step by step instructions.  Made publishing on Kindle very easy.

B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I absolutely love Mumford; however, I was expecting their 2nd album to be not as \\"epic\\" as the 1st. I am very pleased to report that my expectations were 100% wrong. This is an amazing album and I can't stop listening to it!
1401322786|4.0|I was excited to read The Time Keeper, Mitch Albom's latest novel, because I've enjoyed his previous novels. It's a quirky book, based on the life of the man who became Father Time -- the first man to mark the passage of time. I'd never thought of time as a \\"discovery\\" before. I knew, of course, that there had been a time before proper tracking. Cavemen certainly didn't have clocks. But I didn't realize how much we rely on marking time now, and I hadn't given any thought to how people viewed their days, their lives, when something as basic as the days and seasons went unmeasured. No wonder people prayed to their gods for the return of summer, the sun, etc. They had no notion of patterns to predict its return.<br /><br />As with all of Albom's work, he tends to narrate above the story, rarely descending into the emotional, visceral guts of the characters' experience. At times The Time Keeper reads like a gloss, and though there are moments of great feeling and sympathy, these are broken up by sections that alienate the reader with a cool, almost flippant style of writing.<br /><br />It begins with Dor, the man who first measured time, and his family living in the shadow of the Tower of Babel. The book ends with two other lost souls finding their way home: Sarah Lemon, nerdy girl in the midst of her first (unrequited) love, and Victor Delamonte, a wealthy man at the end of his very successful life. Each of these characters has a very different relationship with time, and it is up to Dor to show them the value of their days. In teaching them, Dor too learns what it means to value time. He measured it, but it is only at the end of the novel that he understands what it is truly worth.<br /><br />The Time Keeper is a thought-provoking read, and short enough to be consumed in a day. It's a great conversation starter, good for book clubs, and will make you think long after you've finished reading.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|In a review for a different Gilliam Flynn novel, I made the comment that she did not write sympathetic characters, but I really liked and understood Camille from Sharp Objects. I know other reviewers found Camille passive and self-destructive, and thought the events in the book were too unrealistic, but I have a very different opinion. I loved Gone Girl and Dark Places, but think this novel is my favorite of the three and I can't wait for her next book.<br /><br />There are lots of reviews with summaries, so I won't repeat one here. While I had guessed at the killer, the ending was still a surprise. There are lots of secrets, and lots of despicable characters in this novel, yet there is much to pity. The motivation is apparent throughout the plot, and I felt that everything in it (with the possible exception of Camille getting the story in the first place) made sense.<br /><br />Characters were multi-dimensional, and most were at least slightly likable. The town of Wind Gap seemed like a real place. Flynn's novels will not appeal to all readers -- they are dark and full of violence -- but she is a great writer and I am looking forward to reading more.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I really, really don't understand how this has been a best seller. I liked the beginning but then it went down hill quickly. Just shook my head at the ending.<br /><br />BF read it, she is a very prolific reader. I wanted her opinion. She hated it. As did another friend when I gave her the book.<br /><br />I feel the same way about Fifty Shades of Grey....could only handle the first 100 pages then had to quit. Such poor writing. Ugh!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Not my favorite of the series, however it must be read since its part of the series.  There were a couple of good twists, but it is missing lots of main characters.  The author explains that at the end of the book, which should have been at the front of the book.  Overall, definitely not a regretful read.  Now...on to book 5!!!  Can't wait!

B0053KWDES|5.0|I bought four of these from Amazon, fast and responsive service.  I used each for my ipad, kindle fire HD, laptop and computer.  Most of these portable devices are lacking in audio quality becuase of the small speakers they come with.  This little wonder improves the audio quality and brings life to the music you listen.  It is esential addition I highly recomend. You can boost base and add mellow sound that is usually absent in portable devices when you can couple this amplifier with a good set of ear phone.  I strongly recommed Sennheisser 600 earphone. They are true audiophile earphones. The price of these little wonders are very reasonble.  I especially highly recommend them to all portable devices owners that are missing the audio performance that rob their enjoyment from enjoying good music.  I rate this little audio amplifier five stars plus.

0062513346|4.0|This is a thin book, written for adults.  Nevertheless my children and I sat each night and read each chapter dissecting it to discover the true meaning which led to indepth discussions.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.  I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but I was convinced by the facts, the research, and the testimonial reports in this well-researched book.  We've been trying it now for two weeks and can already see amazing results.  I've highly, unreservedly recommended it to friends with problems I am confident it will help.<br /><br />Update:  It's been ten months now and we're happier and healthier than ever.  The list of friends I've recommended this to has grown and those who tried it are delighted with the results--not just weight loss, but arthritis that has disappeared (me) and so many other health-related improvements.  I recommend it very highly.  Just read it!

I understand that they need to try different things...it's one of the things that I appreciate about them. every album sounds a little different but with Muse we always expect innovation. what happened to the muse of absolution and black holes? I thought they were starting to slip a little on resistance but at least there, exogenesis was wildly experimental. this album just fizzles...

0525953728|4.0|The book \\"No Easy Day\\" is a fascinating look at the training and missions of Navy Seals as seen through the eyes and experienced of Matt Bissonnette a Navy Seal involved in the Bin Laden raid. Bissonnete and the team selected for the raid were considered the best of the best and his description of the actual assault on the Bin Laden compound in Parkistan is chilling. Bissonette's account of how Bin Laden was killed contradict the White House description. Bisonette indicates he took great care in writing the book NOT to divulge any classified information unlike the White House which immediately identified Seal Team Six and how the raid was conducted. The book had legal review prior to publication for classified information and Bissonette's attorney has written the Pentagon indicating the book was not subject to Pentagon review (see [...]). Proceeds from the book go to help our wounded warriors.

Over the last 4 years I have been working early in the morning and late at night on my internet idea. I was starting to think that I was crazy for losing all my sleep time chasing my passion which is training hockey players of all age and skill levels all around the world. In his book Crush It!, Gary Vaynerchuk explains that if you are not working harder than ever before, then you are not going to be the best. The best part of the book is that he gives you a blueprint on how to spend your time moving your idea forward. Gary has me very excited about the future of my online training company, HockeyOT.com.

B00371QQ2U|5.0|I have seen where others have had some problems with loading and the menu.  I didn't have any issues at all.  Perhaps the loading was a touch slower than normal but I have seen much worse.  This is a great movie that really stands up to the test of time; it has legs.  I prefer to focus on the quality of the remastered release rather than plot summary and my opinions on acting(which was great all around).<br /><br />The video transfer to Blu Ray on this release shows just what can be done if those in charge of the transfers put their minds to it.  The picture quality couldn't get any better with beautiful colors and deep details throughout the entire movie.  At no point did I see any grain, aliasing or artifacts of any kind.  The video is completely demo disc worthy for those who have the system that can show it.  I think that sometimes people complain about a disc simply because they are using cheapo blu ray players or who have sound systems that are simply not up to par.  For me, it was like seeing the movie on a brand new master shown for the very first time in the theater. Never the less, the video quality of the Blu Ray is a huge jump from my previously owned Standard Def DVD.<br /><br />The audio transfer, DTSHD 5.1 MA,  also shows what a good transfer and proper audio editing can achieve.  Hope you have a good sound system as it will certainly get a strong workout in many parts of film.  Your subwoofer will have its boundaries explored both during the early music score as well as in many areas of foley effects.  There is great use of the discreet channels with, when appropriate, marvelous directionality and panning around the front and rear sound stages.  Even small foley fx are clearly delineated to their correct audio channels.  All audio is precise, properly leveled and enveloping when you should be enveloped.<br /><br />While I haven't watched them all, there are some very interesting and historical extras and footage in addition to the Standard Def extra DVD for your tablet or computer and the regular commentary which accompanies most movies on disc.  Thank god there weren't a dozen previews of upcoming movies and advertisements that we see on so many discs taking up room on the DVD.<br /><br />For my part, this is one transfer to blu ray that makes having a hi end system worth having.  A great addition.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />ThanksDVD for your tablet or computer and the regular commentary which accompanies most movies on disc.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|i LOVE this album. no filler, ALL killer!! its easy to listen to this whole album and not skip a single track. by the end you're going \\"wait, i want more!!\\" great album! DO NOT pass this up!!!
0345803485|3.0|Ok first, I have the good fortune of working in a small bookstore part-time. What books do you read when you work in a bookstore? I usually read books recommended by customers and books I personally want to read. Sometimes however books come along that everyone is reading such as Hunger Games & Harry Potter. 'That' book now is 50 Shades. We can't keep the book in the store and its the top book requested. A few of my customers said it was their favorite book. So I finally decided to read it to see what all of the fuss is about this fad book. I was expecting a BDSM type of book from the descriptions I was receiving from customers. However, its very light, and I mean light BDSM. Ladies and some gents if you're out there and suddenly interested in BDSM because of 50 shades, put down the ice cubes and whips because this book isn't 'true' BDSM. It more of a book about control than kink. Ana Steele the submissive, is painted as an innocent, that never eats. She invokes her inner goddess quite a bit and likes to bit her lip. She says the word crap a lot and is every bit her age of 22. She's young & inexperienced in the book. The dominant, Christian Grey is rich, well endowed and just as Ana, not very gifted in words. He comes off more controlling than dominant and often gives into Ana and allows her to make the rules. He's a weak dom. If you're truly interested in the BDSM experiences or lifestyle, this book is perhaps the appetizer before you dive into real BDSM erotica. Its possible James, didn't want to go full-on BDSM and wanted to keep it vanilla BDSM. Its a decent vanilla book. there are over 13,000 reviews and lot of them have already went into detail about the bad writing. Yes, the writing is bad, really bad. Some parts of it were so bad I actually found myself laughing out aloud and repeating the sentence because its ridiculousness. Giving Miss James some credit she didn't intend to write a Pulitzer prize winning book. Actually saw an interview with her and she wasactually a little cheeky about the bad writing. She knows she hasn't wrote a masterpiece. Even with all of the bad writing and the 'craps' 'oh sh**' 'eat Ana' 'stop biting your lip Ana', it's a fun book. I can understand why so many women do like it. Don't we all want a billionaire gorgeous boyfriend that takes care of us? Women by these books because a part of us, if we admit it or not like successful dominant Alpha men. Especially when its a good-looking billionaire. Every generation a dom-sub book comes along and it becomes a hit from Marques de Sade to the Story of O, and now its 50 shades. As much as I laughed and mocked it, need to admit it was for me an unfortunate page turner. I was more frustrated with myself not being able to put the book down than the book itself. The whole time I was telling myself this book is 'crap' but why am I still turning the page! Felt like i was in junior-high again, hiding those other unfortunate romances from Harlequin and Zebra romances (remember those steamy romances with the holograms on the cover). I knew they were poorly written but why oh why were they so fun to read. It was wrong and tasteless for me to read them then and its tasteless for me to read 50 Shades now. Once again I secretly read 50 Shades, blinds drawn and hiding in my house, while pretending it's awful & a poorly written book. Only admitting to my inner goddess I secretly enjoyed 50 Shades despite it being truly be awful. Now on to the next two in the trilogy and I'm sure I'll equally have a love/hate relationship with them as well:)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Even though I'm older, I very much enjoyed the \\"Hunger Games\\" Series.  The books are well written and move along nicely.  Maybe not the best choice for the very young reader.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I bought the book with great expectancy, but I was very disappointed and could not finish reading it. None of the characters were likable and the plot uninteresting.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie was very realistic. I like how it explains about Batman's absences in Gotham City and what was very hilarious was how Bruce Wayne was losing his fortune. Tom Hardy did a great job playing as Bane which was ten times better than what the late Jeep Swensen did in that terrible 1997 Batman & Robin. The ending was brilliant how Wayne was still alive and moved to Italy  with Catwoman and the rookie becoming the next Batman. Very enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The story line keeps you entertained, but the writing is horrible.  An easy read for the basic reader.  Maybe a page turner, for some.
1935670913|1.0|I heard so much about this book I decided to buy it.  I was not impress.  When I want to learn about something I buy all the books and if I can afford them, the products associated with my interest.  I'm happy to say  most of those items have meat.  They get to the point and I feel as if they have taken my hand and given me personal training.  Not this book.  I feel as if the writer gave me an introduction but held the real info back to up-sell me on another product.  I can't think of the name they call this sale tactic but in summary, the salesman gives you information which is incomplete.  They tell you just enough to say they deliver what they promise. But, you walk away asking, where's the rest?  That's how I felt.<br /><br />I have to consider this is a short book.  However, I read dozen of short books that shared more information.  This book is really a pitch fest, the writer is pitching his other books to you over and over and over and over again.  If you want to buy a book where someone give you commercial after commercial, buy the book.  This book had no real value to me.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|I tend to read these Ken Follett volumes for the historical insights they yield rather than the interwoven life stories of the characters.  I believe that the first volume gave much greater insight into the early 20th century and the first World War than the present volume does about post WWI up to post WWII.  The volume is excellent, but there is not much in it that I didn't know before hand about the rise of fascism and World War II.  Having said that, it's a great read.  Couldn't put it down.

B004A8ZWWY|3.0|We rented this movie and watched the Blu-ray version last night. The movie is well acted and did a fairly good job of holding our attention all the way through. The story is timely and reminds one of some things that have been going on recently in several places.<br /><br />When it becomes evident one of the wealthy tenants in the tower has engaged in fraud and stolen the pension money from the tower employees pension fund some of the victims decide to take matters into their own hands by stealing back what is rightfully theirs and determine that they need the help of an expert in crime if they are to pull this one off. This is where the Eddie Murphy character comes into the story and proceeds to steal the show as well.<br /><br />Although we did enjoy watching the movie once we will probably not watch it again.
B0029P3II0|5.0|I have to count their version of \\"I Wish I Knew How it Would Feel to be Free\\" as one of my favorites, and I am nuts about almost every kind of music available.

0811870413|4.0|This book is a very inspirational baking book. It is full of beautiful pictures of people and food. The first chapter about their \\"journey\\" to Tartine is very nice reading. I really got the impression of how much they love bread and baking in general.<br /><br />Its difficult for me to write about what I think of this book because I´m norwegian. I will write some in norwegian as well in case some scandinavian people are considering this book.<br /><br />Jeg kom tilfeldigvis over denne boka når jeg satt på youtube. Den anbefales for dere som ønsker å lære mer og få en litt annen bakefilosofi. For det er nesten på det nivået syns jeg, man blir veldig truffet av Chad som er så utrolig opptatt av brød og framgangsmåte. Hans ønske om å bake det \\"perfekte\\" brødet kommer godt fram, og man vil bare gjøre det samme selv. Det er ikke bare enkelt å bake med disse oppskriftene, veldig høy hydrasjon på deigene krever trening. Men boka er verdt å kjøpe om man er interessert i brød og baking, det er god lesning :)
B009CGYO0K|1.0|i've tried to open this e-book on two separate devices and neither of them worked. was really excited to read this book on my holiday, so quite disappointed :(
B0053O8ARI|5.0|While the show does have its stale moments, over all the show does not have a dull episode. Love it and loving the new season already.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is solitaire with commercials. I give it 4 stars instead of 5, not because of the adds, but because of the nature of the ads. They crop up after every deal and are often a video. It isn't hard to exit them, and after you play for WAY too long they will sometimes stop altogether.  I was wary after reading other reviews about the ads popping up outside of the app, but that hasn't happened.<br />Overall I love the game. I love that it offers Vegas scoring, and that you can use pictures for the background and card backs.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am 3/4 way through this book, and it is finally getting interesting.  Tedious reading at best.  The character development was laborious.  The \\"English\\" verbiage took a while to comprehend.  I would not purchase another novel of hers.  Did not read \\"Harry Potter\\" and now I won't.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am presently almost half way through this book, and still asking myself why I keep reading it.  The opening chapter sets up a multitude of plot lines that that could have been followed but none were.  After her excellent series of young adult books I have been disappointed by the lack of structure.  It is an easy read.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Vert exciting and sensual I didn't know a story like this could not be true. I am on book three. Can't wait to find how it all ends.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is an awesome weather app. and I have tried a few. Contains almost everything you would want to know, radar, maps, earthquake info, local and world wide temps, and much more. Easy to use and a must for those of us outdoors and traveling.

Have found my self skipping through the sex in the hope of finding a  decent story line, but i must have missed it!!!<br />I  am trying to finish 3rd book in the hope I will some how be proved wrong but 2 chapters in and it aint looking good ...i feel like a lemming heading towards a cliff.

B009LZH5AI|3.0|I own all five seasons of the Big Bang Theory.  I was really looking forward to the 6th season due to how much I liked  Season 5.  The first episode of season 6 was just o.k., as was this one.  A couple funny moments, but also some serious moments.<br /><br />I watch Big Bang theory for the comedy; not the drama. This is not one of the better episodes overall.  Its OK.  Episode 3 was better so Im still hopeful.
0345803485|1.0|Holy cow, holy crap, holy shit, this book stunk. A silly, annoying heroine. A creepy, make that extra creepy, hero. Shallow and stupid.

0547995660|5.0|Compelling post-apocalyptic novel. An interesting take on the burden of memories. Is innocence better than awareness?

B0091REZMW|5.0|I like the game but find it bit confusing on how to play but I guess that is part of the mystery.
B007RI56NY|4.0|This is a great album. I know lots of people want the deeper, more angst ridden Train from theat but honestly, the current version is more fun. I love the album. I will probably get bored with it eventually, and it may not be one I pull out very often in five years, but you never know
1610660242|1.0|This book is not as it appears. It is a cartoon version and it said this no where in the description. Dissatisfied :(
0393327345|5.0|I love love love this book insanely much. I bought it as a birthday gift for my husband, so in about a month, we'll know if he loves it to. I am very happy with it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I've always liked these games at the arcade.  works just like those but I can take it wherever I go.  love it.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|there has been a lot of hype about this book, giving away U.S.secrets about secret ops conducted by special ops people, and the code of silence Navy Seals are sworn to.  Nothing in this book revealed any of that kind of information, and the book was a bit of a drag in that it didn't really say much about the operation that succeeded in killing Osama bin Laden.  It as more of a narrative on how tough it is to be a SEAL and that being a SEAL isn't just for everybody.  I thought the book was only fair, and was disappointed in it, and myself for believing the pre-published hype.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have had this app like forever and it so fun! all of u haters u know u do HAVE to buy gems ya dummies!!! add kataangforever on Restaurant Story. I will gift and tips every day! :) Thx!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As I read through the series I am becoming more and more in love with this series. It has absolutely everything you would expect from an epic fantasy series and then some. I'm going to be depressed when I finish these books.
B002MGGM9I|5.0|You will need to watch it more than once. You pick up more each time.  Absolutely entertaining.  Also great sound track.  The music in the directors cut kills the movie.  This is not the directors cut.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I find that after watching the movie some years ago, it's nice that John Williams combined all the music from each of the Indiana Jones movies 1-4 on CD. As best movie composer, John Williams brings the listener along for the musical emotional ride. I'd recommend this soundtrack as a companion. Never a dull moment, unlike the last movie in places. Still fun for fans of Indiana Jones!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|Being able to sync my FB with the Kindle was a great thing!  Highly recommend to everyone as a basic must have app.
1451627297|5.0|I found this to be one of the best works I've ever read of Mr. King's; a combination of a time-travel story, a suspenseful thriller, a travelogue of an American era I didn't witness firsthand, and a bittersweet romance. As with most of King's stories, it has some moments of shocking violence. But it has some of his most heartfelt scenes as well: one of them, involving Jacqueline Kennedy, is about as emotional as anything I've read from him. I liked THE STAND very much, but this one ranks up there with THE MIST and THE GREEN MILE as my favorites of his books. It is extremely well-written.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|This book is great. I've read similar biographies of Rock/Heavy Metal musicians and this is one of the best. It is packed with funny stories that made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />This book spends a lot of time on Black Sabbath, with was awesome. But I wish it would have included a bit more on Ozzy's relationship with Randy and that time period.<br /><br />Last note, this book has language which makes it really funny and easy to read. Be prepared to hear \\"Bollocks\\", \\"Bloke\\", and other British terms which are entertaining to people like me not used to them.
0316228532|1.0|I'm sure it's a mixed blessing being J.K. Rowling.  Your books are all expected to be magical and are held to impossibly high standards.  On the other hand, you're richer than the queen and get to live in a castle, or could if you wanted to.  But this book is a long, dull slog by any standard.  With one exception, the characters are smaller than life, boring, and unlikeable.  And the one exception, well--SPOILER ALERT--she goes the way of Dumbledore.  A completely unsatisfying waste of time, money, and shelf space.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|If u only like books that are plausible, don 't read this book.  If you like books with lots of excitement and those where the good guys win most of the time, read Rainbow 6.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Anyone else have issues with disc playback hanging up freezes for 1-2 seconds every 3-5 mins. This is for Blu ray version played back on Sony blu ray player, thx!
B000021Y7X|5.0|My title says it all. This is one of the most original pieces of filmmaking you will ever see. David Byrne is definitely one of the most unorthodox front men in music history but he can bring it. They absolutely smash Life During Wartime and Take Me To The River. Multiple viewings of this movie is highly recommended.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome game! I love it because if you like being sneeky and flying on obsticles then this is the game for you!

B007THA4FI|3.0|I'll admit that I was curious as to what J.K. Rowling would do to try and follow up after Harry Potter. And I find myself not really making time to read it. I believe that I am just now starting chapter 5 and I purchased it the day after it was released. It certainly isn't the same caliber of Harry Potter (and, truthfully, was hoping for the encyclopedia she said she would write) and so far isn't as interesting as the last book that I purchased. I'll eventually finish it, considering I paid $18 for the Kindle version.

0307960471|1.0|I've read every one of the Harry Hole novels that have been translated into English.  In order.  They have devolved.  All I can say about Phantom is \\"Dear God, please release Harry and let him die.\\"
B0078N2MTE|5.0|great story, great actors - you get sucked in (pun intended) at the beginning and the story doesn't let you go -
B005LAII8A|4.0|OK, the time-travel premise is pretty thin. The script invites you to stop thinking about it and get on with the plot. Which itself is pretty thin: Gordon-Levitt's character Joe, without knowing it, is assigned to kill his future self (Willis as Old Joe). Willis thinks this is a bad idea. He's already gotten rid of the team sending him back to be killed, and isn't about to put up with any fuss from a puppy half his age - not even himself.<br /><br />From there, the chase is on. Joe is in deep poo with the criminal organization for failing to complete the assignment. The criminal organization is in deep poo with Old Joe for messing up his future life. Needless to say, the criminal organization fares badly against a massively peeved Willis.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable action flick with a few surprises, including the final one. A good script and great performances save it from the basic inanity of its premises. Still, it's commodity entertainment and utterly forgettable.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B007IXWKUK|5.0|good story, good characters, well written, some people may think that its 'over the top' but it works well within the story - give it a try.
6305511055|4.0|OK, this one works for me at many levels. For me, there's nostalgia: back then, the OCR A font looked modern and techie, phones had dials, bell-bottom sideburns ruled, computers had tape drives, and PDP-11 front panels came in candy colors. Faye Dunaway stood as one of the under-rated beauties of the 70s, and Max von Sydow added class to any role he touched.<br /><br />Then, compared to current spy thrillers, this one comes across more like [[ASIN:B001MVYUQG The Librarian]] minus the humor, only with fewer chase scenes and explosions. Our bookish hero doesn't suddenly morph into a super athlete and unbeatable fighter. The genre certainly has evolved in the near-forty years since this hit the screens, and seeing the genre's earlier members shows that evolution.<br /><br />But, for all that, it's a good story, too - real tension, complex loyalties, and an ending that, in a crasser movie, would have turned into sequel-bait. I'm not running out to get one of my own, but I'll happily watch this again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena is an excellent addition to the  of Olympus series. I understand why we find Percy so endearing; it's because we were Percy when we got his POV in the first five books. Let me say that again, we were Percy, reading and experiencing his life the same way we were Harry Potter for 7 years. So, we got to experience being Jason, Piper and Leo in Lost Hero and got to know a new band of heroes. In the Son of Neptune we get to meet a whole different scene /setting and \\"be\\" Frank, Hazel and Percy. I liked Frank and Hazel's POV of Percy, that was new. The Mark of Athena brings all of these characters together and the main points of the story is told from Annabeth's POV, someone we've known from the beginning and I thought that was special. She is truly a tactician and I liked her moment with the villain. In fact I liked all her moments when she is with the rest of the seven heroes.<br />*****spoilers******<br /><br />The laugh out loud moment was Leo with the Narcissus/Echo story. I liked the clever way Echo's repetitive dialogue bounces off of Leo's and Hazel's speech but still manages to communicate her needs/character from the repetition. The entire scene with the narcissus fan club had me rolling.<br /><br />There were other moments that were also noteworthy - Bacchus/Dionysus appearance, Piper with Hercules/Cornucopia effect, the eidolons,  Aphrodite and the references to Nico. Fun stuff. The ending was hair pulling - what the heck happens next?<br /><br />So, yes, I highly recommend this book.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher - what needs to be said?  If you're looking for an everyman hero, look no futher.  Lee Child - maybe the best at putting together a story that keeps you interested from the first page.  He can't write them fast enough for me.  If you have something planned, don't open a Jack Reacher novel, people will wonder where you are, just like avid Jack Reacher fans wonder where he'll show up next.

However, I could still use it the way I needed it. I wanted to transfer new videos to the SD card in my tablet (ASUS TF101). I saw that I can easily upload the files using WiFi File Explorer PRO and a web browser. That's all I needed it for and it did a great job. I guess people that are worried about security have a point though.

B007TK77QE|4.0|JK Rowling writes in nice clear prose, and you don't catch her trying to be clever - she just is clever. The Casual Vacancy is true to form. I have never understood the HP bashing, and I don't understand the criticism leveled at this new novel. If it isn't to one's taste, then that's not the same thing as it being a 'bad' book. Bad writing is always obvious, but good writing can be both obvious and innocuous. JK Rowling is certainly a successful writer, but I also believe her to be a good writer.<br /><br />I don't believe that this is, thematically, groundbreaking stuff - But who says it must be? It's a character-driven story with contemporary themes.  What I have most enjoyed about 'The Casual Vacancy' is the construction of these characters through realistic conversational dialogue, and unique and discrete inner dialogues. Most of them I have ended up loathing, but it's been fun learning to do so.

B00112C4EG|3.0|I was initially surprised at the low cost of this Schleich Holstein.  My wonderment only continued when the package containing my cow arrived.  The cow was amazingly docile as I released it from the packaging.  After putting it out to pasture I watched to see how it would react to its new home.  It sat there...  and literally did nothing for weeks.  Whatever this strange, small cow breed is, one thing is for sure: It is LOWW maintenance.  If you ever plan on getting milk, I suggest trying something else (like going to the corner store) (If you have corners).
0525952926|5.0|This is an excellent source for a general overview of the events leading up to  WW ll, some of what went on during the conflict, and what occurred after the war ended.<br />There are so many characters that you can easily get confused but there is a guide at the beginning you can refer to for help. The story's characters lead you through the war from the points of view of the USA, Great Britain, Russia and Germany and what went on in those countries pre-war, war-time and post-war.<br />It is fascinating to follow the inter-relationships of the characters who are citizens of the different nations involved in the war and yet personally known to each other. I marvel at Follett's ability to create such an intricate plot based on so many different personalities.<br />I found this novel to be far more engaging than the first novel of the Trilogy, \\"Fall of Giants\\".

B006VREN86|5.0|[[ASIN:B003Y5HWJU Boardwalk Empire: The Complete First Season]]<br /><br />Starts off a tad slow, and overwhelms with gore at first, but you quickly start to love the characters, especially the bad guys. Steve Buscemi is a maestro that has a very dark side but at the same time is his trademark witty and funny self.  Lots of unexpected plot twists and you constantly change sides when identifying with the different characters.  After the first episode you get extremely drawn into the story and characters. Almost as good as the Sopranos thought not quite there. Still a great series that you shouldn't miss.  Another HBO gem.
