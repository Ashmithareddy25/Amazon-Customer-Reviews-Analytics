630587493X|5.0|Clever idea and warm presentation.  Was expecting &#34;Robin Williams.&#34;  Surprised - not too much &#34;Robin&#34; but well acted and heart warming story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is so realistic you can almost smell the stalls. lol. I am so reliving some of my childhood summers. It is a really great app. I never did the competition aspect and it is fun to pretend.
B000I3SYEI|4.0|After Star Trek the Motion Picture, the movie going public was ready for a Star Trek that really brought it.  I think Star Trek fans are going to enjoy all of the action.  This movie is also going to appeal to all ages.  It will become a classic, since they are still playing it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderfully portrayed characters lives are interwoven in a complex but believable plot in which one person's deception has cruel consequences for many.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Jason is a remarkable singer, solid song writer.<br />Great love ballads all over this CD.<br />Mraz will always amaze with his voice.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the story, it kept me at the edge of my seat with every sentence! Awesome book. Awesome read! I highly recommend.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is really pretty good.  I quite enjoyed it as a sequel to the original two, but still very unique on its own.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I have been a Marvel fan since I was a small child so I fully enjoyed this movie.  Nice story and special effects.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I just got it.. I start playing it and wow!! Is so hard... But not impossible .. My little cousins love it.. That's why I got three of them... The original, rookie and the epic!! I love them! Highly recommend!
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|I enjoyed the story line, but I've become so used to HD that the picture clarity really stood out to me and of course the special effects are older and not as real looking to me this time around.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you buy this game your cool the only thing is that it's seven dollars but other than that this game is a masterpiece good job notch
B006OCM0G0|3.0|When will this be on Windows Phone???? I love my windows phone but am tired of watching everyone else play this fun game!! Windows phone is so superior but the game makers need to get on board!
B008MM9630|4.0|I love this app it's a good game and has responsibility it's pretty fun especially with the animations. This game is a must buy.
B00AZQGZVM|5.0|Product comes exactly as described. Cute, lovable and extremely pleasing to have if you're an Animal Crossing fan!<br />Sits well on the firm beanbag it comes with, stands up by itself.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|It is my daily driver.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the quality of this watch.  I wear it every day and the case has yet to get scratched.  The crystal has one small, hardly noticeable scratch on it but I smashed it into a rock while rafting so I give it a pass on that one.  Otherwise it is a great watch. Just the right size, comfortable and unobtrusive.  If I could give it six stars I would.  I also have a black leather band I sometimes put on if I'm getting dressed up and this watch plays the part just fine.  Looks great with my suit and my work clothes.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I enjoyed reading Man 's search for meaning,I will recommend it to my 5 children ,their wives  and 11 grandchildren!I lost a son of 56 years old recently and this book is helping me a lot ,his Logotherapy is helping me!
B006YTTVHO|3.0|This is a very basic book. Very repetitive. Offering very little tangible advice. Tho the author does say in the beginning that this is only for the socially challenged, I think it is even far to basic to be of any use. It's really not much of a book at all, very little substance with a lot of filler and repetitive talk.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|When I was handed the book for my Summer Reading List I didn't want to read it at all. I thought it looked stupid. But I started to read the book and it kept my attention. That hardly ever happens. This is one of the best books I've ever read!!!
B0010OMXKA|5.0|I think this is Andrea Bocelli's one of best live pop concert. Enjoy the concert. The Blu Ray version is better.
B003EYVXVY|3.0|Supposed to be 3D - wasnt  :(  Very disappointed...... I don't know what else I can say about it but was disappointed
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game.. once I got started I really got into.  now I cant put it down....  like the fishing in the ponds and building up my land.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I am a &#34;Hobbit&#34; fan and I have read all the books - looking forward to Hobbit 2 in December 2013.
0062255657|5.0|A beautifully written, magical little tale that is filled with wisdom. I hated that I didn't have the time to read it all in one sitting.  It's a book I want to keep on my Kindle and bookshelf. That said, I didn't buy it.  I got it from the library.  It's too expensive right now.  I'll have to wait for more affordable copies to become available in the used section.  But the story is wonderful.  It's something I want to share with young people in particular.  Not too young, though!  Opportunities abound for book club discussions. My club doesn't tend to do these kinds of books, but this time I'm really hoping to talk the members into reading it
B008AIGWVA|5.0|In this app u can slap Ben punch Ben use his lab and u can also use his phone and have a conversation with him. THIS APP IS AWESOME!!!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I haven't got to use this much, but it's exactly what I wanted for a great price!!!  I have looked at some LowPro bags, but the price is crazy.  I know this is going to make picture taking on the go so much easier.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator for just everyday things, like bills or balancing bank account and it works great! I haven't had any problems with it and I use it everyday!
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This documentary is a must see for everyone! Big Corporations are not going to tell you the truth about the dangers of fracking, this is a very real problem. There is also another film, Gasland II. After this when you see their commercials promoting fracking, it will anger you! Pass this film onto others and share the truth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for all ages. I love to play because it's funny and challenging, my 3 year old loves to play because she loves the minions and their antics are really well duplicated in the game.
B005USZYDU|4.0|I'm not sure which of the Theodore Boone books was first but in The Accused it says that Pete Duffy went AWOL, and now he's on trial in Kid Lawyer, so I'm a little confused as to what happened. Did Pete Duffy show back up to face the music?  Aren't these books suppose to go in an order or are they just stories about Theodore Boone?  This is also a very eventful eight grade school year.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is the first book in a long time that I found myself dragging my feet to finish. I didn't want it to end!  Sci-fi geeks, gamers, and children of the 80's will LOVE this book!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Love the Godfather Trilogy anyway, but the restoration made it even better.  The films were always on the dark side but after the restoration, they are much lighter and with a richer color...it's like watching them for the first time again.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|My father spoke often about our complicated relationship with China, and China's unique history and political complexity.This book by Dr. Kissenger repeated a lot of what my father said, but filled in the historical and geopolitical background that gave me a better understanding of why China is such a unique society. This is a must read for anyone trying to understand our current and future world view.<br /><br />John Fisher
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids LOVE this and can't put my kindle down!  They love despicable me and who doesn't love a FREE game! :)
B0015DROBO|5.0|I hadn't seen the movies, and the book never crossed my mind until my brother gave me a Kindle for Christmas. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was the book advertised on the front of the Kindle, and at a price that made it my first Amazon/Kindle purchase. A fantastic read, interesting and unique characters, unexpected twists and turns, what more can you ask for? I read the other two books in the series, and (as you may know) the author died unexpectedly with the saga unresolved. Hopefully his companion will finish the forth book and resolve at least to some extent the relationship between the two main characters.<br /><br />John Fisher
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|Joe never disappoints, and this album is yet another work of art! I love the grown and sexy vibe, the live band feel, and his amazing lyrics. Great job!!
B009UZBLSG|1.0|I just got my slimport and hooked it up to my new nexus 7 but it does not work with three different tvs and 2 different hdmi cables grr i just hope i got a defective unit.

B00BB8SKPW|3.0|A growing number of actors seem to believe that a crackle in the voice is cool ... maybe so, but it makes dialogue difficult to understand.  When they combine &#34;crackle talk&#34; with &#34;low talking&#34; it is impossible to follow ... I might as well be watching a foreign film with subtitling.  In real life I ask for a repeat.  In a movie or TV show I'm likely to loose the flow of things.  I understand that a drunk might not be understood in real life.  But in a movie, play or TV show understanding the spoken word is required.  So speaking in a manor in which your audience can know what you are saying is part of being a good actor (IMHO).  Dean Martin and Foster Brooks and other great portrayers of drunkenness would not have been funny if their audiences could not have understood the dialogue.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Love the historic ties and reality of this show. Funny how issues of the early 1900s are similar to today's issues.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Non stop action, great movie much better than 1st installment<br />Great scenes<br />Great martial art sequences with snake eyes and storm shadow
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Ico and Shadow of Colossus are quite exceptional.  They’re concurrently beautiful and minimalistic.  There’s not a whole lot of music, but when there is it is quite becoming.  Not to mention, they’re poster children for the argument of video-games-are-art movement.  They have also paved the way for other games, like Journey, to be accepted by the masses.  And that’s quite a feat in a day where Call of Duty is the norm.<br /><br />I won’t go into too much detail here because chances are you already are familiar with these games or have heard about them.<br /><br />In Ico you take control of a little boy with horns cast away into a labyrinthine castle.  You must escape this castle with a female, Yorda, who’s stuck in the same boat as you.  All the while fending off shadow monsters who attempt to abduct Yorda.  It’s an escort mission at its core.<br /><br />Shadow of the Colossus throws your character in a large beautiful but desolate land in an attempt to awaken an unconscious woman.  (Love interest?  Friend?)  It’s just you, your horse and sixteen giant colossi.  Beat all the bosses and you win.<br /><br />Minimalistic in concept, stunning in execution.<br /><br />Frankly, the games are better on this collection than their PS2 originals.  These games were built for HD before HD was even a standard!  I mean that in the sense of the scope and presentation of the visuals lend themselves quite well to large format TVs that have become more and more the norm than, say, a 32 inch tube TV that I originally played Ico on back in 2001.<br /><br />The remastering is Bluepoint Games’ typical standard of excellence.  (They did, after all, work on the God of War Collection and Metal Gear Solid upgrades)  And stereoscopic 3D is thrown in the mix for those of you who may be into that.  (I’m not…but hey, it’s a great bonus.)  Notably, via the game’s latest update, is off-TV remote play via the Playstation Vita.  This is a fantastic feature for those of us who have our systems in the living room and don’t want to hog up the TV.<br /><br />Going rate for this collection is about $20.  There is absolutely no reason you should not get these games at this price.ho have our systems in the living room and don’t want to hog up the TV.<br /><br />Going rate for this collection is about $20.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Every episode is full of quick, fun dialog and satisfying comeuppance. Love it. Can't wait to catch up on all the seasons.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Won't show the bottom of the pin. Gets stuck and goes all the way back to the home screen do you lose where you were. Stops all the time!!! I stop using it on kindle and just do it on my phone which sucks since it's smaller.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This was a very captivating book that held my interest. Read it in 2 nights. I love time travel! A really different read from this author.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The Chromecast will not turn my TV on, that is very minor thing.The problem is the Chromecast is now it is so limited in what it can do, basically watch Netflix and You Tube and get into The Google play (music and movies) on a pay basis. Yes, you can watch it on your TV without a wired adapter and this is nice. My Roku XS  Console can get 10X more internet contents plus Netflix and You Tube also (I paid $59 for this at Costco) yes with the Roku player I must use their included remote. Google needs to get a hundred good solid company's to make players that work with Chromecast to make it a must have product. If this happens buy Chromcast if not this prouduct will die on the vine. Wait Wait Wait before you buy.
B00E193TM2|5.0|It's almost not fair for me to review this release since I pretty much was gonna love it no matter what, almost not fair. Despite me being a huge fan of the band and Ivan, I know it's a great album despite my bias. One thing I have to say is that the songs are freakin catchy on here. I literally can't get them out of my head. I enjoy all their music and my actual favorite songs by the band are not even on this album (not yet anyway, I need to spend more time with it and I'm sure that will change.) but these tunes are sticking with me more so than any of the other albums. I'm not much of a sing along kinda guy, I prefer to listen and listen well. But I've been breaking my own self imposed rule over and over since I downloaded this. I practically have me Lift Me Up memorized from when I got the single, that's how much I listened to it. I don't usually have the time to do a song by song breakdown, but I'll make a small exception this time.<br /><br />Lift Me Up - one of my favorite songs on here, good to hear Rob Halford joining in, great way to start things off, actually is kinda uplifting<br /><br />Watch You Bleed - it's a good song, similar to stuff they have done in the past, but fun to listen to all the same<br /><br />You - this is an interesting song, I kinda love it, maybe because it fits alot of people I can think of that fit that \\"you\\" role but I repeat this one alot<br /><br />Wrong Side of Heaven - the titular track and again similar to stuff they have done before, it's very good, I personally prefer the heavier and angrier tracks (in general, not just by 5FDP) so it's not one of my favorites on here but I still like it<br /><br />Burn MF - I love this song and I'm not afraid to admit it, it is a really fun song and definitely one of my favorites on here<br /><br />I.M Sin - might as well just read what I wrote for the last song, exact same feeling<br /><br />Anywhere But Here- this is the song it took me longest to adjust to, I had to listen to it a few times before I got into it, but I did and I enjoy it now<br /><br />Dot Your Eyes -  this is my favorite song one this album hands down, I love it, repeat it over and over and sing along as well, if I had a theme song this would be it<br /><br />MINE - this one falls under the \\"I like it but it's not going to be a favorite of mine\\" category<br /><br />Mama Said Knock You Our - ok so IMO this one should not be on here, I don't like this song at all, maybe it's because I never liked the original version or maybe it's because it feels really out of place here or maybe it's both, I almost took off a star but I couldn't do it for just one song<br /><br />Diary of a Deadman - another interesting one, starts off like a little story then instrumental than Ivan interjects at the end, not one of my favorites but not bad either<br /><br />I.M Sin 2 - no change in my opinion for the collaboration, still love it<br /><br />Anywhere But Here 2 - this one is odd because it seems to feature more Maria Brink than the version that says it features Maria Brink (unless I'm wrong on who I'm hearing here but I definitely don't think so) and IMO this version as a duet sounds better than the other one and hearing this version a few times made me appreciate the song more<br /><br />Dot Your Eyes 2 - this version is too much for me to handle LOL it's already my favorite song on the album snd then it has to go and feature Jamey Jasta (who I think is freakin awesome btw) and now I love the song even more, if I could have had one request it would have been to equalize Ivan and Jamey's parts but not gonna complain<br /><br />All in all, many of the songs on here do feel similar to their past works but is that really a bad thing? Not to me. Yet at the same time the album somehow manages to give off a slightly different vibe than their other albums. Is that a bad thing? Not to me. The album is quite good overall, very catchy, nice and heavy in your face ass kickin style you expect from 5FDP. You know it is them, still doing what they do and doing it well. I highly recommend this to all fans out there and if you are not a fan yet, get this album and their older ones and become a knucklehead for goodness sake. I cannot wait for volume 2 and hope it exceeds this one. Any trash talkers about this album can come see me and I'll dot their eyes and ..... LOL!!!!!ow it is them, still doing what they do and doing it well.

8866135909|4.0|This is a great planner, but the pages are a little thin. I would recommend using a pencil, or a light pen so that it doesn't bleed through. The strap on the outside that keeps the planner closed is a little flimsy, but overall this is a good product, and I'm not disappointed.
030758836X|4.0|I really liked this book, once I got to the middle, I didn't want to put it down.  I loved the fact that there was a twist I wasn't expecting.  I would definitely recommend it, however, I HATED the ending.
0061122416|5.0|This book is a must read! The week before purchasing I had seen several references to this book (perhaps this was a sign for me to read). Simply, the story is based around a boy on a journey whom through out the process of his journey/self discovery really discovers himself & his purpose. The text really resonated with me as at this point in my life I have times when I feel stuck and unclear as to where my life is heading. When I tell you this story is amazing wow. If you only read one book this year, please read The Alchemist.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very fun. Keeps you busy/entertained and has been good on my battery! I would recommend this for any age group especially if you need some downtime and want a simple addictive game.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I love this game.  It gets challenging, but just keep working on the solutions.  To developer: an undo button would make this game 5 stars. I know some people would abuse it to cheat, but for those of us who are actually working through the solution and accidentally paint the whole ball black by forgetting the hard hat, an undo button would be fabulous.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this app, it appeals to the puzzle lover in me, and it has unending games. its even a challenge to go back and try to redo puzzles that you have completed before.
B000FP2OPY|3.0|The box was pretty beaten up with a ring around, indicating that someone put a glass on top of it. The discs are scracthed, some more so than others. I haven't played all of them yet to check for skips.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I was told about this app at my orthopedic surgeons office. Like the office, every time I go there I get what I need. This is a great app and it frees up a lot of space on my phone and computer.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|1) set up took forever to recognize my network<br />2) Google help# the guy could care less if it worked, he was too distracted to help me. Help told me this will not work on IOS devices. REALLY!!! So i had to get my windows laptop to make connections<br />I had to hang up and do this myself.<br />3) my connection finally got connected but the play rate is too slow to be able to watch TV<br />4) I'll keep this only cuz of the 3 months free Netflix value of $24 ( I think Google was genius in setting this up to keep returns minimal)<br /><br />Just like 1/2 of all of googles products, they ship it out before all the bugs are worked out. I know better but got caught up in the hype<br />My suggestion is to wait until more content become available and they do a few software updates.
B0018QXL1K|5.0|This is my favorite TLC CD. Love the songs; singing; and music. I really miss TLC.  RIP Lisa &#34;Left-Eye&#34; Lopes.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Mouse is way better than I thought it would be. best deal on a mouse ive seen in a long time,
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Okay first of all good job Gameloft. I play gta and this is the closest thing I can find to gta besides Gangstar Vegas. I heard that Vegas is really good and I wanna get it soon. This game has realistic scenes of Rio and the stuff you really love about gta. The helicopters are kinda hard to drive but that might just be my opinion :p. And don't listen to the guys that say it doesn't work on kindle: it works great they are just paid by another company to say so. But if you really wanna go big get Gangstar Vegas.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read, I Cant wait to see the movie!! I am hoping they keep the same actors from Hunger games.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This is the best book  I have read this month I'm going to get a another one !!!!! Ok ok
B0073PPNE8|4.0|Can't decide if I loved it or hated it. I watched it because a friend recommended it, but I was mad at him after because it was SO SAD! I wept for every character in this movie. On the other hand, it was beautiful. The camera work, the dialogue, the costumes, everything was awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book so much. I seriously exhort every teenager to read this book, you will learn so much. Thanks John Green.
B003SI3URQ|4.0|I am a teacher and I used this at the end of a unit on Greek Mythology, after our standardized tests. It was a nice break for the students, but still gave them a review of characters we learned about. It definitely kept their attention better than listening to their boring old teacher!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Very addictive, challenging and definitely keeps you thinking, especially for someone with ADHD, lol. I also love the &quot;100 Floors&quot; games.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Terrible book - long and drawn out, took forever before anything happens, just about one of the most depressing  books ever. She was definitely trying to do a 180 from Potter, but , my God, this was too much! Don't read!!!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Fun story. Good humans. Bad giants. Bad humans. Good humans win. Jack marries the princess and i think they live happily ever after.
B0086700CM|5.0|Super game, very addictive, once you start you will want to continue to see how far you can get., before you fall or those mummies get you. I use it on a Galaxy smart phone, as it works very well, tilting the screen as you run make the whole game even more enjoyable.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|Weak opening built around Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Great characterizations. Fun to recognize that congress was almost as dysfunctional then as now. I'll watch it again.
B00BJZJXWG|5.0|This album is so beautiful and well done. The voice is sensual and smooth. The arrangements are just lovely. My fave.
B00A285OOW|3.0|Seems like the whole book was spent waiting for disaster to happen. No joy in that book at all. I was disappointed.
B001ENS0BI|5.0|A combination of creative ideas with a reasonable amount of unpredictability and excitement. I am so sad it is over. Better than Lost.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Lot's of twists and turns with an unexpected surprise at the end. Keeps your attention and most people will like it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had some trouble with loading and buffering bit other than that it was great. So thank you for the wonderful experience
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|While most everyone still loves the 1938 Errol Flynn film, this is a gritty, imaginative, and compelling story that differs substantially from most of the earlier versions. I thought the realistic sets, the moody lighting, and the terrific performances (Russell Crowe, Cate Blanchett, and Oscar Isaac stand out), all combine to make this film thoroughly engaging and enjoyable. The Blu-Ray is top-notch, with some interesting extras.
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|One of the classic albums alongside their early days!!! Back to the roots of the founders of real hr-hm power sound!!! The real masters for everyone in the world!!! Rock-forever! Problems-never! Cheers!!! Thank you very much!!!
B0037EAJAC|5.0|I've always appreciated Akira Kurosawa, and this is my favorite movie of his.  The updated picture is good, and the bonus extras aren't so bad either.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! If you like the game subway surfer you will love minion rush, it's mostly the same except it's with the minions. It  has bananas instead of coins and battles with various enemies, so it's not exactly the same. The different obstacles have varying difficulty levels. If you don't know what subway surfer is, in this game you run as a minion through multiple courses inspired by the movie .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We love this show. We cannot wait until the next season comes out. It can't be quick enough!! Recommended to adults, my 14 year old thinks it is boring lol.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Some action, some cliché - its ok but not a must see by any means. If &#34;he&#34; wants to see it, you will survive.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie really puts you into the mindset of what really happened to so many people during the 2004 tsunami. I would recommend it. Warning though, it is a chick flick and made me cry!
B00632HWOG|5.0|It's so convenient when traveling with my Kindle to get notified when I have new mail and so easy to retrieve it.  I now leave the laptop at home.
0062255657|5.0|This latest Neil Gaiman novel exceeded my expectations. Much shorter than some of his other novels, this one is as delightful, delicious, surprising, and satisfying as anything I've ever read.
B00D6QUJ6U|2.0|Eagle Rock should know better;releasing a &#34;blu ray&#34; disc that is standard definition and just re-mastering the audio. Picture quality does not look like it was remastered and up-scaled and should not be advertised as a blu ray disc. I would not waste your time on this disc or any other of Eagle Rock's &#34;SD Up-converted&#34; disc if you are expecting to see a picture upgrade.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I listened to part of it on Audio book, but then read the whole book over again.  I really enjoyed it.  It was hard to put down.  You really had to pay attention to the headings as it went back and forth from years gone by to the current time.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This is such a cute movie. I have a wonderful LG 3D television and my boyfriend and I go to the theater to watch all the 3D movies we can just to see if it's something we like enough to buy. This one has really good 3D and we enjoyed it both at the theater and on my tv. The storyline is really cute and if you love animals like I do it's something you won't want to miss.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Any fan of rock must do themselves a favor and see this.  Extremely well done.  Dave should be proud!  Sad to see the 'in memory of Brian Hauge' bit.  Anyone know what happened to him?
B00BCSBU4E|5.0|...this is the set to get. 50 cds in the box with replicas of album artwork. It is tightly packed in the box so no shifting of CDs. Every CD in the set was in perfect playing condition. And the price can't be beat.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Our son read this book and recommended that we read it. My husband and I are hooked on Lee Child's books. We read mystery, history and westerns. In the past my husband read only westerns and now he is a Lee Child fan.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is the best camera case I've ever owned. It holds all my gear and is very easy to carry over a shoulder or on my back.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|My husband and son are reading Lee's books. In fact, our son hooked us on these books. I recommend Lee's books to everyone that loves a great mystery.
B00821OX98|5.0|I didn't watch this show when it came out but saw that it was free to watch on Amazon Prime and I just kept putting it off on watching it. I finally caved in to watch and now I am a fan. This show is addicting. Luckily I was able to get through the first 10 episodes in a day. I just kinda wished they would have a few more episode per season.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this show to anyone that likes aliens and action and good story. Now I can see myself anticipating more seasons to come!
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I bought this book, because I enjoy Vince Flynn books and my son asked me to try his Lee Child books.<br /><br />Lee Child keeps you on your toes!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Timeless tale, with the technology described in this novel, it is hard to believe that this was originally written in 1977. The author wonderfully captures the lengths that humans will go to to protect the world as they know it, including raising children in the direction they want them to go.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a pretty neat little device.  It's got a few quirks and hiccups, but that's what you get with a device that's still in beta.  Sounds like more apps are headed down the pipe soon so this will only get better.  Got it early enough to get the Netflix credit too!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I truly do enjoy this app and how can you go wrong when it comes to the weather channel which I watch often and now I have it on the go. So thanks weather channel for creating a wonderful app.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love Bingo Blitz, great game. I keep on playing, can't put it down. It's fun and exciting. I play Bingo Blitz on my smartphone and tablet.
B0006HJEMC|5.0|Revell makes a rare series of 1:1200 Cruiseship/Liners. Hard to find them all. Excellent detail on all I've collected so far. Thinking of creating diorama of sinking! Simple to build.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My first Stephen King book since reading his earliest classics...he is back on track with terrific characters and a captivating story!
B0078QYI1G|5.0|It's hard to describe how good this CD is - great musicianship, knockout tunes, super variety.  If you listen to this CD and don't start at least tapping your toes, there is something seriously wrong.  Unbelievably good!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I listen to this often it is a lovely cd with all of my favorites. I expect to listen for years to come with pleasure.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|no matter how many apps /I get they all sick asa this app is complete whit n crape Crap. I hats it
B0061S0A64|5.0|Very cool app with awesome visuals<br /><br />Pros: Visuals are great, sounds are cool, unique and fun way of making music!<br /><br />Cons: Control are slightly confusing, needs an insruction guide
B008M0NDOK|3.0|Duo Gamer works great with some games but not as well with other games. If the Duo Gamer worked well with all games I'd like it better.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Perfect level of complexity and simplicity. Puzzles were difficult enough to take some time to solve, but not so much I wanted to throw my Kindle across the room. Loved it and I look forward to the next one!!
B00003CXA6|4.0|Reasonably accurate portrayal, it was fun to see on the event's sesquicentennial. Beard wig person should be drawn and quartered, though.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The game was fun to play and the only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that the placing was hard to get correct
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Once you start playing this game you'll never stop. It is a lot of fun, because there are minions. You will love it as soon as you start playing it.
B00136JPB0|5.0|This is an amazing CD/MP3 or whatever you would like to call it. Brilliant musician who should still be around, this is a great piece of work.
0061537969|2.0|the book had too much racing in it for me, if you like car racing you probably will love this book
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Every song from start to finish on this 3 hour DVD is just perfect. The Cohen band is a blend of expert musicians and vocalists. Treat yourself to this concert. Better yet, go to a Live Leonard Cohen Concert. But this is the next best thing. The best seats for this concert are in your home.<br />G LeBlanc<br />Southwestern NH
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was amazing! If you liked his other books you'll love this one, I'd have to say this one was my favorite, it had emotion, love, thriller, powering. Everything I want to read in a book..
006178480X|5.0|A great edge of your seat thriller. James Rollins always provides a good story , but over and beyond that he provides situations that not only open your eyes to the world around you, but also to the science, and history that effects you daily. He gives you something to think about. He also alway backs up his story with honestly separating the fact from fiction. After the story has been enjoyed, he writes author's note giving the reader a perspective of where he got his ideas and how much of what he used is fact.<br /> This book is a great quest- in four days or less Sigma Force must follow a trail of artifacts which may or may not lead to the grave of Attilla the Hun, a site rumored to hold all the riches of all the kingdoms Attila conquered, to find an artifact that was supposedly given to him by the Pope to ward off Attila's planned invasion of Rome. The artifact is said to be made of metal from a meteorite that had fallen during the passing of a comet near earth during Attila's time.<br />  The book begins in a NASA flight control room with Painter Crowe observing the flights of two sattelites IoG-1 and IoG-2 (IoG is an acronym for Interpolation of Geodetic Effect) intended to analyse the space-time curvature around the earth to aid in missile and satelite trajectory, but the satelites were also going to measure the energy signature of a passing comet. As the satelite is measuring the energy something goes wrong and the satelite crashes to earth in remote Mongolia.The last fleeting image the satelite sends is a view of the East Coast destroyed and in flames. Dr. Jada Shaw, astrophysicist, beleives this is an image from the future and that it shows the destruction that the comet's passing is going to cause. Painter must get the team together to retrieve the satelite before it falls into enemy hands. However the members of the team are already working on projects - Gray and Seichan are following a lead to find her mother who she was separated from in Vietnam when she was nine as the soldiers arested her mother. In Rome, Monsignor Vigor Verona has received a mysterious package from a priest who was thought long dead. The package contains a skull with aramaic writing and a date carved in the center of it and a book bound in human skin containing a copy of the gospel of Thomas the apostle. He has a sample of the skin sent to the lab and calls his niece to come to see the artifacts. A bomb goes off and they narrowly escape with the artifacts. They request help from Sigma and Monk is sent to help them along with Duncan, the newest member of Sigma force, and Dr. Jada Shaw, the astrophysicist who was conducting the satelite experiment, as the team makes its way to retreive the satelite.<br />  With heart-pounding edge of the seat thrills the men and women of Sigma force must overcome overwhelming odds and foes to find the key to saving the world.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I watched this season on amazon prime and was in for the long haul.  It is current, smart, fun and the cases are really interesting.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I like this game but it gets boring before long.  I grow tired of it pretty fast and am looking for something else.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Not a racing fan, but a dog lover. A very sweet story that's painful at times, but worth sticking with to the end. Makes you want to love on your pets!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This dictionary is much better than the one that came with my Kindle. Very easy to use. Great addition to my Kindle.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|This was great listening as usual. This gal is a very favorite of mine,<br />She plays a terrific piano, has that sexy quality to her voice and<br />I'd like to come back someday playing and singing just like her!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|To boil it down to its essentials but expand on my WTF? reaction, I always have to remember that these books weren't meant for me- an adult. Katniss's strength got lost but I guess she gained what many a teenage idealist wishes for. Kids dig it. Just not me. Kind of like the end of the Dark Materials trilogy. Too bad.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|We all think our food comes from large green farms where cows happily moo and chew grass in the fields and pigs and chickens forage in the high grass. WRONG. This documentary shows how our food is really mass produced and has become a mechanized industry based on profit, not nutrition. Animals are kept in horrible conditions, fed rbgh growth hormone and antibiotics in their GMO corn, milk cows are forced to produce more milk causing mastitis which puts pus in the milk (which is allowed at &#34;acceptable levels&#34;) and how animals are turned into food. It also shows how crops are genetically modified (GMO) and sold to us to eat when there have been studies that show that they cause cancer, birth defects, disease, etc. This is a very eye opening documentary. Watch and learn and become proactive. Tell Monsanto and the food industry that we don't want GMOs in our meat or produce. Know what you are eating. Cancer rates and autism cases have skyrocketed in the last 10 years. Why? Could it be all the unsafe, unhealthy additives (chemicals) they are putting in our food? The food we are feeding our children? Knowledge is power people!
B00001OH7P|5.0|nothing else to say really. groundbreaking when it was released and still amazing to the ear. many times over WOW
B0054JZC6E|5.0|we have really enjoyed this app... has something for everyone! good for kids and adults - can spend couple minutes or hours
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I love, love, love everything Michael Connelly writes.  I especially love the Harry Bosch series.  I hope Michael never stops writing
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|this book just rips apart Christianity and makes Jesus what He clearly said he was not, a man who would overthrow the government. I was fooled into thinking I would learn something but I didn't,.<br />It was clear Aslan was a surface Christian for a few minutes then sought to destroy and insulted millions of us!
B000HZGNEU|5.0|This was classic Star Trek. Loved Bill Shatner. The storyline was great being set in present day. What was the deal with that ratty old truck!!
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I have only a few of his adventures, but the character portrayed is much like the TV version in terms of personality.  For that alone, I find the book interesting, but obviously it is a classic, and is a classically good read.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|So glad I got these DVDs. Great series starring two masters of comic timing. Plan to watch it again and again, then share it with friends.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|When I saw this advertised I knew I needed it for my collection. What a sweet, sweet movie. All the characters were wonderful. When I finished watching the movie I felt so moved by the story line.
0802473156|4.0|This is one we always come back to because the advice is classic and valuable. People understand &#34;gifts&#34; from their own experience, not necessarily what their partner sees as appropriate. This is about learning to communicate in your SPOUSE's language. We often give it as a wedding gift.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|If you are looking for a stirring plot and character development, this is not your movie.  If you are looking for a fun movie, with good action and special effects then rent this one.  I can't believe critics try to rate every movie based on skill of acting, plot, and character developmetn.  C'mon folks, it's G.I. Joe.... what do you expect?
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie started out crazy. Then when Samuel L. Jackson entered the picture it became certifiably insane. Whats next for Quentin? A remake of West Side Story, less the dancing.
B007C8MK2Y|5.0|When the dvd of this show first came out, I was bummed as there was no blu-ray release slated that I could see. Luckily,  one day while online I checked and it was available on blu-ray. I promptly placed my order and had the disc a couple days later.<br /><br />The picture and sound are amazing on this release. We put this on often. I have been wanting to hear the newest songs done live and this release does not dissapoint. If you enjoy Yanni's music, you will enjoy this show.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Very good read.  Interesting dynamic. Characters were well developed and storyline was easy to follow. Great vacation read!  Great mystery.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|I have really been enjoying this album. I can't think of one song I don't like. Most of the songs make me want to dance and sing along.
B000JMKO3C|5.0|Too good to put aside even for one minute. I was swallowed by the story and regurgitated it many lessons. Tender and strong. Thank you Paulo for such an insightful book with this very different take on dieing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As an occasional Masterpiece Theatre fan, this to be one of those presentations that really stand out. I started watching it predominantly because of Maggie Smith (an outstanding actress) but found myself enjoying many of the characters in Downton Abbey.<br />As a somewhat &#34;particular&#34; fan of military history, I found the second season to be right up my alley. The ugliness of war was presented with intrigue. The apparent lack of aristocratic barriers during wartime then the attempt to restore those barriers after the war was handled &#34;politely&#34;.<br />As an American I found the different levels of social standards in a single household to be interesting. I wonder how other societies and cultures interacted with that style of living. Especially those societies that were not part of the British Empire.
B000W9179M|5.0|Being a Paulo fan and having read almost all his books doesn't make this dull- another masterful book of spiritual quidance with a storybook appeal. I can't wait for anothe book to read.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I don't normally go for fantasy or magical realism, but this book is stunning.  Totally engrossing.  Definitely read it - the sooner the better
B000W94FIW|5.0|Spell binding throughout. Paulo is deep and emotional with a great storyline. He once again holds you spellbound with his vision. Could't put the book down. Wonderful.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|IT MAKES ME THINK. IT HELPS KEEP MY BRAIN FIT. I WOULD LIKE MORE LEVELS.<br />if you like puzzels games give this a try.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|He write more as a narrative with each chapter a new lesson by a wise person who gives simple yet profound life lessons. Well done. As always a joy to read and I thrive on what is being taught in this humble fashion. Very inspirational.
B005544V6A|5.0|This has easily become my new favorite TV show. I don't know how I missed it before. BEST SHOW EVER!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very  good writing - will keep one anxious to read the next chapter. Anyone who do not believe in heaven should read this book - it convinced me.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|We all in my bookclub liked this book a lot.  The twists and turns in the plot.  The sadness of the story etc.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|i feel as though the case is a great access to have. it eliminates placing your headset on a table or counter top.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I saw the special PBS had of this concert - Wow !. Yet, this two DVD concert is an order of magnitude better. Not only are there no commercials, the video and audio quality are excellent !. The DVD has mini interviews of these artists, detailing what was going on during the writing of these songs. I highly recommend it !
B007SYWFRM|4.0|The little girl that I visit plays this a lot and she loves it.  She won't put it down when she is playing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it has world tours, and during the world tour you go to a lot of fun places:) <3
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is on my kindle for the little girl I watch, she plays it a lot and keeps her mind busy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game I think so because it gives me skill and it is just a fun game to play. This game is also fun to play with my friends and family. We have a lot of fun playing this game with them.
1596354208|4.0|I was looking at this book when I got it, which it arrived very quickly, and I think I will be able to do these.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great time killer and fun to challenge your friends to.I've wasted plenty of time trying to beat the high scores and will waste plenty more.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is on my kindle for the little girl I watch, she plays it a lot and keeps her mind busy
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Okay, just to level set things. Prior to owning this product I criticized Plantronics for using a proprietary charger. I have own the previous model (Voyager Pro+) that has a standard microUSB port for charging. I have had it for a couple years.  Worked great until a few weeks ago when the USB port failed.  When I pushed the microUSB plug into it, to my dismay the port on the unit gave way and recessed into the unit making it unuseable.<br /><br />So now we know why Plantronics decided to do away with a standard microUSB port.  That said, the small desktop charger is really nice.  The headset magnetically snaps into place. Effortless.  I also purchased the protective charging case. I strongly recommend it.  It DOES use a standard microUSB cable, protects the unit when traveling and has a built-in battery providing 2 additional charges without having to plug it in. Its designed really well.<br /><br />I like the Legend better than the Pro+.  The sound quality on the Pro+ is really good and so is this one.  The big difference between the 2 products are the controls - power switch, audio feedback on time remaining and whether or not it is connected to your phone, volume controls are much better, the mic is thinner. In addition, they moved the call answer/end button. Instead of it being a big button on the face side of the ear piece, its smaller on the end of it - smaller but less likely to accidentally hang up on someone by touching it.  I also like the feature where it knows when you are answering a call simply by turning the mic in talk position - it took a little getting used to because I was so used to touching the call answer button on the previous model. I also like that you can still answer the call via your phone if the Legend is in your pocket and you can't grab it quick enough.<br /><br />So why 4 stars instead of 5.  The only reason is that after all these years why couldn't they have made it a bit slimmer behind the ear. Not that its bad but wearing readingglasses, it kind of gets in the way.  Otherwise, its a great unit.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is a very good thing to have on kindles for a child that has nothing to do.  Keeps her out of trouble
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It was ok not the best but it was kind of fun. Can't think of anything else to say so I am righting this
B008XG1X18|1.0|It was much better when you could just pull up pinterest and not be logged on.  I could care less if I have a board. I just like to see how creative others are.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I was expecting a lot for an Oz movie.  I found the characters stupid with no depth to them.  (Unlike the original Wizard of Oz which is the greatest movie ever)!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Was not what I wanted @ all.... I want the acutal game for kindle!!!! Who cares about the levels if you can't download the game on your Kindle????
B004G6009U|5.0|Arrived in good time and undamaged. Bought it for granddaughters who love it and use it also in driving distances in car. One of their favorites!
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is just...awesome. Create music and beats however you want,save them,share them! Really entertaining and interesting just to watch them float around your screen.don't even get me started on all the cool settings there is for the nodes. I'm glad I came across this jewel while it was free app of the day. Whether your a music lover,are creative,or both,this app is for you. Definitely worth it...and c'mon.It's free today.
B009R659L8|5.0|She did it again. Another terrific story. Cannot put the book down! Can hardly wait for the next MHC book to come out!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This is supposed to be an app aimed at children, but to complete goals you are forced to spend money & add friends. I wouldn't mind if there was a way to add people who already play the game, but it wants your Facebook info? My kid is 6, she has no Facebook page or email address.  Also one of the main characters cost over a hundred dollars to purchase??!!!! Crazy!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I find that the game is very addictive. very easy to play. I play this game on a daily basis.
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|the game glitched out and shut down if I touched the screen at all on the first level. tried shutting it down and re-opening several times before giving up. From what I did see while I just watched the game happen, I was not impressed with that either. Graphically, it looked good...that's about it.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino does it again! Such a great movie. I loved Christopher Waltz in Inglourious Basterds and seeing him transition from a cruel nazi savvy detective into a soft hearted bounty hunter was awesome to see. Plus the soundtrack is great! Though I could do without the Rick Ross song, I enjoyed John Legend's \\"Who Did That To You\\" and the classic Richie Havens \\"Freedom\\" reminding me of footage from his 1969 Woodstock performance. All in all, this movie is moving, witty, hilarious and has a great story line. Q.T. never fails to make fantastic films!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is my new favorite book! I have heard it described as geek-tastic and I agree! I read it 2 times in a row! Everyone I have recommended it to loved it just as much!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton is so entertaining and one of my favorite shows. My husband and I never miss an episode. We can't wait for the new season!
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|a very well done album, you can feel the details in every song, it has a very personal, acoustic sound, with beautiful lyrics, amazing voices,  without leaving aside the usual Backstreet sound that we all love, i don't have it yet, but it doesn't mean i haven't heard it and i know when i get it i'm gonna be able too see some pretty artistic photographs, BEST ALBUM YET RECORDED BY MY BELOVED BACKSTREET BOYS.
B00DMM3WVM|1.0|I have tried to play it but the game lags a lot,  each time I play it I end up shutting down my kindle.
B00CW665VI|5.0|10 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />I love love love this story and could not put this book down. I was laughing and sighing and rooting for all of the characters. The characters are so distinct. It's told from Drew's POV with a refreshing, clear voice which I loved. I fell in love with all of them.<br /><br />The writing was clean, concise. And the language was beautiful. The images were so original and clear; the whole book really was like reading poetry. ;)<br /><br />Exceptional story and storytelling. :)<br /><br />[I can't wait to read more of Ms. Chase's books. I'd recommend 'Tangled' in a heartbeat.]
B00AREIAI8|4.0|one of the best free apps ive come across. keeps you interested by always offering new things as you level up and has things you can buy if you save your money!
030746363X|3.0|The auther is kind of all over the place in the book. It's a lot of reading to get through.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abby is probably one of the best series on TV. I have to give credit for the compelling story lines and the drama that the show has created. If you haven't watched this series I would suggest that start with season 1 and you will be hooked. This has to be one of the best shows on TV. I can't wait for season 4.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great grand kids watch this movie over and over. They are 6, 7, and 8. Fast moving beautiful color. Appealing characters, Catchy music.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Don't waste your money. Purchased this ad-free version thinking I wouldn't have to worry about my 3-year-old being bombarded with ads and micro-transactions. I was wrong. This is dispicable and should be illegal. IMO, Its like selling cigarettes to a minor. Shameful.
0345803507|5.0|book more than met my expectations.loved all three books wishing there was more to the series i would definitely buy them if there were more
B0061S0A64|5.0|Got this app when it was free over a year ago. Glad to see it back for free again so I can have my wife and friends DL it. Thanks devs, some of the finest work I have ever seen.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|From the beginning to the end I was captivated. Great actors bringing history alive!  I would watch it again and again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good honest time waster, lots of fun working your way through and very addictive! A few bits got me thinking but not too hard that I got bored and gave up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like temple run and other games but I like this one the best because it is based on the movies and it feels like you are a minion yourself. Thank you created a for creating this game! Also this game is fun for all ages young and old. Hope you enjoy
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|Apparently part 2 doesn't have really sync up with the first movie. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT. Let's kill Duke right away and then have storm shadow join the joes. That's like have vadar join the rebels because he realized wrinkly face plotted to have his wife killed. GI Joe 3 is going to be cobra commander is actually Dukes other personality and never died. I could have drank a case of beer and slurred out a better script consisting of gibberish and random shouts
0345803485|5.0|This booked lived up to all I expected! I could no put it down. It is a great love story
B008XKSW7M|2.0|It was listed as a comedy but there wasn't comedy in it.  Pretty boring!  I would not recommend this movie.
B00021R7CG|5.0|Action from beginning to end . I recommend you should check it out . It is worth buying thIs video .
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A bit hard to read at times. Good book, but truly a classic with the old English, etc. read when you have time to read slowly and retread to get meanings.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It's exciting and fun. I want to keep playing but I can't pay... I really wish it was free<br />Please
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is the perfect place to start watching for new fans, & old fans, like myself, who have been watching for years.  Christopher & Bobbi are perfect!! Couldn't have asked for a more heart felt pair! Love it all, can't get enough!!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I love the multiplayer on this game by far the best ive ever played! And the graphics are amazing with no lag. Even on multiplayer! Get this app!
B00DHNB5CY|2.0|I don't really hate it because it's entertaining to watch but too much nonsense going on (does that make any sense to you?).
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|This DVD is bringing back memories from before my husband and I were married. Thanks for bringing this into our living room.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I loved the song Blood but didn't expect to enjoy the whole album. Slow songs aren't my style but I don't feel the need to skip them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I started reading this book, at first, I never thought it would've played the way it did or in the direction it did. It defiantly took me by surprise, and I couldn't stop by wanting to know more! My mother-in-law told me it was a good book to read and my husband has told me the same thing or so everyone has told him. As a result, now I can't help but want to keep reading next book to see what's next for Anastasia and this handsome, mind-bottled Christian. Just wish I would've read it sooner!
B007RV5T1U|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring and stunning documentaries I have ever watched, not to mention transfixing! As an artist (violinist), I was blown away by the beauty and the devotion, the expression and the sincerity of feeling portrayed at every moment in this masterpiece. 10 stars if I could!<br /><br />~Aviva, 19 U of M
1400069289|5.0|Written much in the style of Malcom Gladwell, with interesting stories followed by a scientific explanation, this is an great read.  I was interested in starting new habits, but the book was more slanted toward changing old habits (Duhigg's website has some additional resources that are useful.  Be sure and look there).  All in all a wonderful and educational book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS APP IS A MIRACLE SO GLAD I GOT IT!!!!!!!<br />IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!<br />GET THIS APP!!!<br />YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!!!
B0093LINVK|5.0|After trying various ARM based Linux boxes for running XBMC which were either too slow or couldn't handle all the variations in my XBMC library, the NUC was a dream.  Not only is it lightning fast at navigating the XBMC library it also perfectly decodes and streams everything I have thrown at it.  It will handle all various audio formats to the receiver for audio bitstreaming, etc. that the ARM based boxes just cannot do.  The integrated video chipset is also fast enough for many games and so it's nice to access my Steam collection on this tiny little box.  I have tested it with about 5 different wireless HTPC keyboards all of which work well including Logitech, Microsoft, IoMega keyboards.  The only downside is the current video driver has some rendering flaws, so you need to install the prior edition if you see visual artifacts in Windows 7 with XBMC.  It makes a great Hulu or Netflix streaming device as well and has no problem with keeping it.  It is super silent and runs pretty cool too.  Combined with a fast SSD drive like Mushkin, it will boot Windows 7 in less than 10 seconds.  The only other thing wrong with it is that it does not ship with a power cord.  I am sure some genius at Intel thought it was a good idea to do this since different demographics use different cords, but what this means is that you get your new toy for Christmas and can't use it.  That will certainly piss you off.  Also, the box has a really neat Intel sounding chime when you open it which probably cost more than including a power cord.  That part is pretty darn dumb by Intel.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|A sterling cast, a great story line. Location is perfect. very enjoyable, Alec Guinness character is a study for psychiatrists.
140006922X|1.0|Look at the feedback on this book over the last two days alone.  Reviews praising the work have a few \\"helpful\\" and a few \\"non-helpful\\" numbers.  Reviews challenging the legitimacy or possible underlying intent of the author are hammered with hugely disproportionate \\"non-helpful\\" numbers, and anyone offering statements critical of the author in follow-up comments to feedback are dog-piled with negative numbers to the point the comments become hidden.  Either someone with an ulterior agenda is spoofing account names on Amazon in an attempt to discredit detractors of the author with bogus numbers, or there's something bigger afoot.  Either way, it stinks.  Christianity is once again under attack, and once again the Christians sit idly by and let it happen.  Ridiculous.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Although this app lack of major options like other ones, this app is yet simple and fun to spend hours making all kind of beats, which later you can actually record and listn on your private MP3 player. (The files format is .ogg)
B008220BLG|3.0|A step or two above others in the genera. A sweet essay on tolerance and acceptance with some Shakespearen underpinnings.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I love this game. Sometimes you finish a level in 10 seconds and sometimes you cant finish it at all! let you burn free time, i recommend this app
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Former Google Reader user here. Very happy with Feedly and its GUI, in particular on my Kindle Fire. I do not miss Google Reader at all.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|For Kakuro, but yet the UI isnt comfortable like doing it on the back of a newspaper.<br />But as far as it come to apps for android, this one take the first place
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Just started it and am amazed! It is working - am on the looking for cars and chose purple colored cars because I never see any - well today I saw so many I couldn't believe it.  LOL  Great!
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Nice app for making PDF files our of your camera. Great for students (like me) or for anyone. This is still need some improvment, but yet its really good one!
B002BVOYBW|4.0|Although I had seen Depp in other TV and movies before this, this shows the spark of comical genius (and homage to silent films with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin) that would gain him other roles like the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\".  Great movie about a family struggling to get by and the ray of sunshine a young oddball man brings to them.<br /><br />Reccommendations: [[ASIN:B00009AOAZ The Dream Team]], [[ASIN:B00005BKZJ Bagdad Cafe]], and [[ASIN:B000SW4E02 Raising Arizona]]<br /><br />CA Luster
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What an addictive game.  Good graphics, challenging courses, fun special perks.  One of my favorite apps.  Very kid friendly as well.  Bravo!!!
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|This film excels as an action flick but was a little to much for me, jumping from one blow-em-up scene to another with little chance to catch your breath between.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|As usual, Google gets it right.  This allows me to access the multitude of google apps and almost the full functionality I have on my pc.
1439170916|2.0|Required reading for college. OK to get thru because of the short chapters, but felt like reading a text book.
0553801473|2.0|I got this book and it's huge!!<br />As in height and width, not depth.<br />It's very hard to hold and carry with you on the train or bus.<br /><br />I returned it because I found it in paperback somewhere else.
B0047TB09K|2.0|My HS jr had this as required summer reading. had difficulty getting thru book because it was redundant and boring.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|On my ipad I use a few news apps and this is one of them but on my kindle fire hd I mainly just use this one I find it very kindle fire hd friendly.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is the cutest movie ever, the minions are so adorable, my kids love it too. I'm going to buy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft rocks! It's hard to get away from the game when your really into it. I am not a Lego geek at all but I love this game so much!!!!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|New backgrounds for space and the crazy birds do different things.  It's a nice challenge!  It's a great change of pace.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child is at the top of his game with Jack Reacher. His stories are varied, but they all have an element of authenticity. If you are looking for adventure, mystery, good plots and good character development, then this book is for you.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This is very difficult to use, no instructions and no points or stars.  I'm really not sure what the point is and I haven't really enjoyed playing the game.  I have enjoyed the layouts, but nothing else.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I wish I could play this game, looks cute - but it won't finish loading for me.  I have a Kindle Fire HD 7 inch that isn't a year old yet and have tried loading it at several spots, in case it was my wifi at home (which I've never had trouble loading anything else from) .. anyway, just reporting, so if it happens to you - you will not think you are alone!
B00479SVBU|5.0|Tired of RADIO??? No tape player, no CD player, no AUX-IN? NO PROBLEM!!! Get this transmitter and you will not be disappointed! (this product is officially approved by Yoshi Gish)
0061537969|5.0|This is a funny but sad book. It warms your heart. Very worth reading! I could imagine myself in the story. After I got done with it I gave it to my sister. She loved it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great book for kids in fourth grade and on up.  A very touching story.  Can't wait to read it to my kids.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie!  What great scenes of Alaska - with a totally unexpected storyline and results.  A must watch!
B0036G1T78|5.0|One of the great espionage thrillers of all time. (Redford, Faye Dunaway, Max Von Sydow, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman!) Try watching &#34;Condor&#34; back-2-back with Redford's more recent &#34;Spy Game&#34;—a great double feature. &#34;Condor&#34; is a thriller with no car chases and only a few shots fired. Lots of surpirses and twists right up to last frame.
0375422307|5.0|This book was needed for a summer reading assignment - a very interesting story presented in a very interesting way.
0062238868|5.0|this book tells the story of many vailant heroes that have fought and died in the defenseof this country. It is raw and cruel yet vailant abd brave.  i loved it.
1451695195|3.0|The authori provides an interesting life-after-death experience.  Much more unusual than others I've read, probably due to fact (as he say) of his brain being in an extended period of days of total shut-down mode.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had a hard time watching only one episode a night.  In fact, some nights I watched 3 in one night.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is one of the great books on WWII in the Pacific.  It tells the story like it was and presents both the horror of the war as well as the heroism of those brave Marines who fought in the war.  Everyone should read this account to see just what we owe those who sacrificed so much so we could be free.  Just consider what we might have today if they had not been successful?
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|I purchased this amazing book somewhat reluctantly as the sample reading did not appeal to me.  But the reviews were so good that I pressed the \\"purchase button\\" and read it in five hours, giggling and rereading sentences over and over!!  I echo every good review that has been posted.  A GREAT READ
B005ZUR724|1.0|Great game, but terrible customer service and game moderation/maintenance. Maybe when the team grows up you should b u y a game from them, but not now.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I love this app. You can listen to the best music and you can listen to the music on Kindle fire HD
B0091X2K0A|5.0|This is a great movie by one of the most original filmmakers of all time. I most highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app makes me feel like I have a real horse like I have always wanted<br />I love this app
B0046ECJBY|5.0|It is usually an intellectual challenge to read Dr. Kissinger's books and this one is not an exception. It is a formidable text about an extraordinary topic based on historical events, interpretation thereof (mostly through personal experience), concepts of governance and leadership (mostly through personal perspective). On the top of that you get Dr. Kissinger's own ideas about world order and about its likely evolution in the future. If you disagree with Dr. Kissinger's concepts and your analysis differs from that of the author, you should still accept the challenge offered by the book. Actually, it is very likely that whatever your opinion was \\"on China\\" before reading the book, you will end up with a better understanding and with a better set of arguments on the topic.
0061336459|2.0|I did like some of the ideas but in reality we've heard it all before....But here we are a month after I read it and I really cant remember it much. Must not have left much of an impression...
B002PEP4U0|4.0|Okay it started getting good at chapter  14 really?!  So i giv  it 4 stars but it was nice .
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I had been searching for a portable tcg that was as equally enjoyable as playing Magic. Now I don't have to settle for something LIKE Magic, I can just play it! I haven't explored multiplayer quite yet but I'm sure I'm in for some epic battles in the near future.
B009YU9J0E|4.0|I listened to Crystal Castles for a while before (III) came out, I liked their sound but I wasn't a huge fan of how harsh and attacking their music can be. I really enjoyed being able to experience a mellower and softer Crystal Castles, especially vocally, Alice seems not to scream and yell as much. It's not really 8-bit sounding like some of their older stuff, which I appreciated. If you enjoy listening to their other stuff, give (III) a try, it'll grow on you!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|The copy and paste functions could be improved so that like comments can be entered into multiple days.<br />The calendar is easy to use as are the note pages.<br />Better than some other notepads I've used.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I first heard a couple of alt-J's songs through an indie artist website and I was intrigued by their unique and interesting sound. I had to have more, when their album was finally released I bought it immediately! Give it a listen and see if you like it too!
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked it. Never really got bored, worth the time for sure. If you have some free time I highly recommend watching.
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|This book was very entertaining. I had no idea what to expect and I was surprised at the ending. I am looking forward to book #2!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have a masters degree in religious studies, so I've read a lot of books about this subject. And I think this is by far the best. It's an easy read, very good story telling, but based on good evidence. If you want the details of that evidence, read on beyond the last chapter. There is a lot of detail about how he arrives at his views.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this book is about the historical Jesus, not the Jesus of faith. But I really didn't find that much conflict between the two in this book. The familiar nativity stories are not historical, but that's old news. Scholars wrote about that decades ago. I was surprised by how he dealt with the resurrection. But the historical Jesus who sided with the poor? Is that really incompatible with the Jesus of faith? I hope not! Pope Francis doesn't seem to think so.<br /><br />If you are interested in the Jesus of history, what it was like when he lived, you can't do better than to read this book.
006112429X|5.0|Reading this book was like a punch in the gut. When you have a baby there are all of these emotions and feelings and those are brought out beautifully and sensitively when the \\"normal\\" feelings aren't what happens.<br />You feel that his mother yearns for freedom but she stays because of her baby. She tries and that is what makes the father hard to connect with because he doesn't see the effort.<br />The character that touched me the most was Kevin's little sister. She never had a chance with Kevin and the father. She was a mommy's girl.<br />You hope for the best but know in your heart that it will not end that way.
1781162646|3.0|This is Stephen King at his most boring.  I really expected a thriller, especially with the setting and the story.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's bad, but it certainly isn't good, and well below King's usually standards.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A page turner for sure, a good pick for a book club because when you finish you'll need to process it with someone.  Look up discussion questions online.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you have played minecraft on the pc and xbox360 like me you probably want to get it on your kindle fire hd device i reccomend you try it its a really fun game to build things i say if you like it on pc and xbox why not try it on the kindle fire hd and kindle fire
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|They need an &#34;Easy&#34; version to get use to the game and it's options, then once you know how the game is played, you can step it up....cute though!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The only thing I would change in this app is make the costumes less expensive and make more places available to run. I am getting bored with only only 2 places available to run and with my regular MINION suit until I can afford a costume I also wish It was easier to get the tokens and a way to personalize the way your MINION looks Weight, height and number of eyes- wise.
B006UV8DJS|5.0|This app is extremely easy to use and incredibly cool.  Make pictures look professional.  I would highly recommend.<br />I would definitely buy again.
B005OZE9SA|2.0|when i conect the headphones into the interface and give a test, i cant hear a suitable volume, i hear it very low; and if i increase the volume, this saturated..
B003XVYLDU|2.0|I had a suspicion that I didn't like Vonnegut's writing style and I was right after reading this book. I've read Cat's Cradle before and that book is all sorts of crazy. So that was my intro to Vonnegut, but I thought I'd give him another chance. Tons people love him, but he's not for me. I had never read this book before, but it's a classic so I gave it a try. At least I can say I've read the book though and can give me honest opinion about it. I'd much rather read more Fitzgerald or Hemingway.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I would like to know if this DVD is official, because I didn't find out nothing about it in Madonna's web site<br /><br />Thank you to everybody who took some minutes for write some words and provide me the information about the MDNA DVD. I modify my review and for all I'm not a little Monster LOL ;)
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It's a pretty good game; however, I have a question:  When friends send you extra lives, how to you &#34;get&#34; them once you're done with your regular 5 lives??
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag. I took on vacation and I love it. Carries all my equipment. I'm a photo enthusiast and it fits my needs perfectly. Amazing price.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|ok you can Wright story's in it and then the game reads it. u can chang the Color of the paper. this can help me a bunch when school starts I can right homework in it its great!&lt;3 this app
B008DKBO8G|5.0|This fits great and feels stiff enough to offer protection.  Most of the time Kindle is in my computer bag but sometimes in my cargo pocket and it feels very safe in the sleeve.  Fit is good and look is quality.  Bought mine used from Amazon and got a better deal but it would probably be worth it even at full price.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas sparks has done it again! I absolutely have loved all his books! But this one had the most surprising ending!!
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Very informative.  Enjoyable reading & challenging as to how this applies to business in general.  The book is not only baseball, but how to think outside of the box.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I really doing enjoy watching this show.  I mean you get to watch these two really good looking guys and the show's not bad either.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Nice running game would be nice if it were tilt screen activated but still a fun game all these same highly recommended
0061692042|5.0|Most finance books leave you with a feeling of \\" Need to learn More\\" as the lingo is so complex;not this one. It leaves you feeling empowered and that you can get started on the right track immediately. Thanks for the clear read Brian, it was refreshing!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game I have it on everything I own I have even purchased the full version<br />Absolutely can't get enuff
B00003CXCT|5.0|These DVDs were replacements of the videos I had.  Got a good deal on them.  I am a fan!  Right, Jar Jar Binks?
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|This movie is so well done and perfectly plotted.  It hints at every Aha! moment of Shakespeare's making of R & J, and is just a lovely written and acted film.  I could see it over and over and over..... and over!!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The race is exciting.  The politics familiar.  The war unusual.  Good stuff....  8 more words! What can I say?  Become a Star Wars Fan!
B000HL2J0G|5.0|My daughter was brought up by MacGyver to be noble, generous, and brave.  MacGyver has never failed us, and never will.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Not a surfer fan, but hearing others speak up about this got me out and finding it to watch on the silver screen.  Really enjoyed it....
1582701709|5.0|I keep this book by my bed & reread it over & over.  Go on to something new, then always come back to refresh & keep my energy the best I can be and attract all the wonderful things, people, money, jobs, etc. I deserve.  One of my core books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So amazing!!! I don't know how the universe survived without it! I love the characters each month is a new crazy character. BEST APP EVER!!!!!
1451648537|5.0|Best book I've read about Steve Jobs and Apple so far. Many interesting stories you won't hear anywhere else. Excellent.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Really good but kind of slow. It needs to show more of the family and it has me waiting for the next season
B000VZFYDC|4.0|A great overall album with several singles being the highlights. The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is that it seemed to be a continuation of the previous release which means no new innovations with the music. Worth the download if you're a NIN fan.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Pretty good.  Drug on a bit in some parts, but I kept with it.  LOOKING forward to reading Losing Hope.
159463176X|5.0|wonderful heart warming story of family love, devotion, and conncetion.  can't wait for it to be in paperback to recommend to bookclub
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I chose five stars because North and South is an amazing mini-series! Richard Armitage is an amazing actor, and Daniela Denby-Ashe was a fantastic (the best) pick for Margarete Hale. It is captivating. I recommend! I love this mini-series.
B00A25NLOU|4.0|This novel has it all : a secret society, mysteries, old computers, new computers, programming, Google, Hadoop ! Great read for all geeks.
B005SAP45I|5.0|Great movie!!!! They Pixar creators nailed it again when it comes to Cars 2. Very good details when it comes down to Even the smallest  things.
1416549447|1.0|Open the book, and all the text is printed upside down from the cover's orientation.  Flawed product with no discount for defect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game can be addicting and awesome at the same time because you play forever and the game can glitches and mess you up but I still love the game
B005TVYVI2|5.0|I have only been swimming for 18 months now and I am always looking for ways to improve my stroke.  Almost immediately after getting the Tempo Trainer I was able to zero in on my &#34;ideal&#34; stroke rate.  I wear it all the time while I swim, even in races (triathlon).  It's also great for pacing in the pool.  I set it for an agressive lap time and try to constantly get to the end of the lane before it beeps on longer sets.<br /><br />I was swimming in the ocean recently and unfortuately, I lost the TT when I got hit by a big wave.  I am ordering a replacement now.<br /><br />The only negative I see is that the TT sits inside a holder with a clip (that can attach to your goggle strap).  The unit can pop out of that holder pretty easily.  This isn't how I lost mine though, the wave knocked the whole unit (with holder) off of my goggle.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|I think this is a great game for star wars lovers and pinball players. It has really great graphics and its sound is terrific. May the force be with you!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|It is really just I imagined it would be and can see why I love Castle on TV so much - the characters are so interesting and somewhat similar.  Would recommend the series to all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game to play. I really like all the different characters you can choose from. Now the jump stick to jump high and collect coins in the air is cool. I love this game.enjoy playing when the kids start to work my nerves.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|One of my favorite films, a true classic. Showed this film to my girlfriend for the first time and she loved it. If you love the music in this film, be sure to buy the soundtrack. You won't be disappointed!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The feels that I got. Oh my gosh. I recommend to everyone. Never have I cried that hard. Good gosh.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I enjoy a quick view of the weather. And watching the radar shot. It is about as accurate as most weather forecasts.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|love the game but for some reason i try to download a new virus type like the zombies but the app store force closes and shuts down
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book was fascinating. It could have been plucked from my own childhood nightmares or adult wakeful dreams.  Filled with fairy tale possibilities, it still made perfect and utter sense as do all dreams.  I was in awe that the story played with the notion that we all are connected and do indeed know everything underneath it all and have somehow forgotten. Great read!
B00594XOZU|3.0|If you want to look at a video or sum u can't or a kik sticker u can't u gotta download a another app which Amazon didn't have like it need to be updated for real that's so annoying but other than dat it's kool
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the one touch auto placement. You don't have to drag &amp; drop. Good time killer if you like solitaire.
141659521X|1.0|This is just disgusting. All of Flynn's novels advocate torture (as if it worked), glorify violence and pander to all our worst fantasies.  The novels are also filled with prejudice against other cultures, mainly Moslem. Add to this that Flynn is a formula writer with no ability to develop character in any credible way and you make me wonder why he is a best seller.
140006922X|4.0|I read the book because I was curious after hearing it was 'anti-Christian'.  It isn't.  It gives a very interesting and useful context to Christ's life that I haven't seen elsewhere.  It is not exactly a bombshell that Christ was both a revolutionary and spiritual.  Christ, after all, was complex and he lived in times that would make a person revolutionary.  The Romans were oppressive and brutal to all they conquered, including Jews in the holy land.  Not surprisingly, anyone concerned for the welfare of the Jewish people would feel compelled to do something.  Christ is depicted as courageous and fearless -- as a Christian, I don't really see the problem.  His times are fascinating to read about since it provides a better understanding of what he had to deal with and why his words and work had such a huge affect on people in his time.  I very much enjoyed the book and recommend it highly.  And for the record, as an educated Christian, I have no problem with someone of Aslan's academic experience writing discussing Christ, since the point is to do a good job; which he did.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|This is a great  game . I love how you can Chang the worlds to space and Easter and the jungle . This is the best game.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This is a very fun little app! It's creative and unique. I don't often get involved in music apps, but this one is different. It involves dragging little dots that make different sounds to create your own music. It also puts in a little piano scale from top to bottom. You can also save any sound combinations you like. Overall a great app, although it's best to watch the battery as this drains it pretty quickly. 5 stars!
B00CKOQC9C|5.0|I had just finished re-reading Fahrenheit 451 and needed more Bradbury.  I ordered the kindle version and ran through it as a fun summer read.  I remember it took weeks to read when I was in high school.
1599218011|5.0|Written in  a fun easy to read style.<br />BEST BOOK! great information<br />BEST BOOK! great information<br />BEST BOOK! great information
B00296A4F4|4.0|Love the music and the pilot episode was outstanding, as we all can relate to trying to &#34;belong&#34; and be accepted in high school.  Episodes that followed the pilot were less and less interesting as politically correct issues became the primary focus - this is not necessary and detracts from what could be an outstanding human experience series.  Regardless, the series is still worth watching and is entertaining.  The music rocks!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It's rare that we are allowed to truly share the most private thoughts of anyone, let alone the mentally ill.  This book  gives the reader a fascinating and enlightening glimpse into one man's mind, his world as he sees it and his struggle to return to a normal existence.<br /><br />We see how our own lives can be influenced by family, friends and our experiences.  What would it take to cause us to retreat into our own shell.  The most gratifying part of this story is knowing that one man, through love and Therapy, is on his way to a good life again.  Mental health issues can be treated with great success and this book reaffirms that.  Who doesn't love a happy ending!
B000SOYEQY|5.0|great story great cast well done a movie for all ages very very excelent production peter o'toole the most actor that could have done it
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I finally got the stealth class better then call of duty in a lot of ways get this game I recommended it for every one thinking to get it
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Back to Black Sabbath.  Clever lyrics with a interesting twist. Eight great numbers, Thirteen ends where Black Sabbath began.  Great effort.
0525476881|3.0|It's hard not to compare this to John Green's other novels, but I can't help it. This one doesn't have the same left over effect that I got from reading The Fault in Our Stars or Paper Towns. It was funny at some parts, but it wasn't a book that I had a problem putting down.
B005B19UPE|4.0|I had already read the book that was borrowed from a friend and wanted to purchase my own copy.<br /><br />The issue was in great condition with little to no wear and tear, no highlighting or dog-earred pages.
B007SGM084|3.0|Need more time to read - seems like a good book.  Delivery was immediate so shipping is not an issue here.  Price was good for a trilogy.  Thanks!
1476727910|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first page. It's science fiction, of course, but wrapped in philosophy and poetry. I was amazed by the creative story line - why hadn't anyone thought of this before in quite this way? - and how various themes fit together so perfectly. While its premise is serious, there's enough comedy to lighten the load. I stopped a number of times as I read this book and marveled at Haig's incredible insights into humanity. I don't think I've ever spent better time reading a book. This is sure to become a classic; it's surely destined for the movie screen as well.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This is a fun and entertaining game. I had a ball making each one. The only real problem I had was it was to short. With just 44 levels I beat it in about an hour, I wish it had more levels.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Same old cowboy plot...the bad guys get their comeuppance and the good guy rides off into the sunset with the prettiest<br /><br />girl. Different characters and different actors don't make much difference..<br /><br />Overall, wasted time and money/.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is amazing but the guy should be a little faster like in temple run so u don't waste so much time being slow
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I actually have 3 of these (I couldn't wait) I ordered one form Google first, then I ordered one from Amazon and finally the anticipation got to me and I picked one up at best buy so I could immediately try it out (I don't have cable so all my tv is viewed online)<br /><br />Got the one home from best buy; here has been my experience<br /><br />1.)  Netflix and youtube work FLAWLESSLY in high definition and perfectly synced audio, at least for me not matter what device or computer I used.<br /><br />2.)  All of my (previously) current laptops from the most powerful (don't make fun I'm not a gamer) Samsung with a B950 Intel Processor to my lesser internet only pc's had problems with either audio or video quality when casting a tab.  The B950 could cast a tab if I turned the quality down to the lowest.  However some sites would still not work.<br /><br />3.)  Today I picked up a Samsung laptop with and 2.4ghz i3 open box from bestbuy for $214.00 HOLYCOW  I now can stream with perfect audio and in the highest resolution supported for casting a tab while I write this review in another!  It's AMAZING :)  That being said if you have the requirements they want you WON'T be disappointed, this is a night and day difference!  And I realize I had to spend the extra money on the higher performance laptop, but I will sell one of the older ones and recoup at least 1/2 my money, get to enjoy a faster laptop, and still be ahead over having cable with their none stop commercials and outrageous monthly fees :)
B00BBW15R8|5.0|The movie is based on a true story. It was well done - but I thought a bit pricey. Was willing to pay the price though.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|Whew! Just got the CD and haven't stopped listening. There's so much energy in this record!! Thanks, Peter Asher and thanks, Kenny, Georgia and Gary, for the passion you've put into this collaboration. Sounds like you have been playing together for years, as Kenny notes, referring to Mr. Burr as his musical \\"brother.\\" And Georgia, you DO make a 4th voice through your three soaring, beautiful harmonies! The songwriting is just so great. The whole record dances and sounds as if you have been positively itching to work together; these tunes just overflow with lyrical and musical magic.<br /><br />I've seen Mr. Loggins multiple times in NE Ohio, including Blossom Music Center last century and his gig supporting the Cleveland Clinic HeartThrob Ball a couple years ago. I almost can't get my mind around his multiple personalities, from his brilliant vinyl folkish days \\"Sittin' In\\" with Jim Messina to his mega-volt electric Danger Zone, Don't Fight It and Caddyshack successes. But they all WORK and in total he's got one of the richest catalogs in music. This CD belongs right up near the top, too.<br /><br />Kenny's powerful voice, shining out acoustically and electrically through the decades of his music, has never changed. Now, it's amplified through Blue Sky Riders - make no mistake, Georgia and Gary are supremely talented singers and players - and I am certain he takes pride in this new experience, as he has in his previous musical journeys. What a career, and we are so blessed to have the opportunity to enjoy fresh songs through this new incarnation. Gushing?? You bet! The CD is simply spectacular. Last thing. This new trio reminds me very much of Art Garfunkel's trio CD from several years ago, Everything Waits to be Noticed, with the fantastic Maia Sharp and Buddy Mondlock. It is 5+stars as well. Three voices making music that sounds like a whole choir! Please consider that record as well, if you like a familiar, unforgettable voice such as Kenny's and Art's, paired with dynamic new voices. Now for comment about BSR's performance in Kent, OH, at the Kent Stage recently. FUN was the operative term. In addition to the beautiful music from this CD, supercharged with the energy the trio and the fine band had in the live setting, I am thrilled to say that Kenny Loggins STILL has it!! At 65, doing the fourth of four shows in a row, with strong voice and so much energy! Then, after the sweaty BSR set, he goes out and gives 90 more minutes of brilliance, showcasing his spectacular career and featuring sweet new arrangements of his best-known songs. And Kenny seems so humble while talking about Grammy awards and co-writing experiences with other superstars. Gary and Georgia are also multi-award winners, of course, and I was so struck by the shared enthusiasm on the stage while singing the songs. GREAT CD, even better live, if you can see them!!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|This DVD rivals &#34;The Last Waltz&#34; in historical relevance.  The back up artist are reason enough to watch--the &#34;Man With the Golden Voice&#34; and his wonderful poetry just make it irresistible!
B00A0SO4S6|4.0|This is an old movie that I like to rewatch.  It's such a smart thief movie and those always appeal to me.  I think Pierce Brosnan is great in this and Rene Russo as well - sometimes this type of movie involves no growth or change for the characters and I think you get to see each of these characters grow and change as the plot progresses.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game reminds me of my childhood when I would play mansion games that were solitary like this one and you had to open doors and such. Fun gameplay and good memories.
1401938906|3.0|The minute I heard about \\"E-Squared: Nine Do-It-Yourself Energy Experiments That Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality,\\" I wanted to read it. I'm not only a big fan of The Law of Attraction (I've been studying the teachings for years and have had some truly amazing manifestations), I'm also a big fan of approaching new concepts with curiosity, an open mind, a sense of adventure, and a willingness to experiment. Whether you're considering a principle or practice, the most direct and powerful way to get a sense of what something is about, and whether it might be right for you, is to actually apply it in your life and see what happens.<br /><br />So I love the fact that Pam Grout teaches the Law of Attraction by proposing thought experiments for people to play with. Unfortunately, most of the book's experiments didn't work for me. I suspect this is because I'm so used to working with the power of my mind in an emotionally based, creative, and very open-ended way that suddenly becoming super specific about what I wanted to manifest and then applying time limits to it, simply didn't resonate with me. But different approaches work for different people, and these experiments might be the perfect vehicle for someone who has a more left-brained or scientific approach to life, who is new to the idea that \\"our thoughts create our reality,\\" or who appreciates Grout's sense of humor.<br /><br />While I laughed out loud in a number of places, Grout's humor often got in the way of the book's message for me, especially when applied to what I was supposed to be telling myself, or the universe, as part of an experiment. Of course, Grout encourages readers to personalize the wording used in the experiments, and I highly recommend you take the time to do this--to make it your own.<br /><br />Although I'm quite well versed in this subject, there were some ideas in E-Squared that I found absolutely liberating. This one is my favorite: \\"We have to retrain ourselves to think of this energy force the same way we think of electricity. We don't wonder, `Am I good enough to plug my toaster oven into the outlet?' or `Have I prayed long enough or deep enough to deserve the right to flick on the kitchen lights?'\\"<br /><br />Essentially, E-Squared attempts to get us to prove to ourselves, through experimentation and personal experience, that the Law of Attraction is real. That it's a universal law at work in our lives, which we can learn to harness (using our thoughts and feelings) to create happier, healthier, and more abundant lives. The electricity analogy supports this so perfectly by showing us that it's not worthiness we need to obtain in order to consciously apply the Law of Attraction to positive effect in our lives, but knowledge, clarity, and a willingness to focus more on what we want (to do, be, or have), than on what we don't want.<br /><br />Although I found the book disappointing in some ways, I agree with its basic premise and think newcomers to the Law of Attraction will find it worth the read. Taken together, Grout's explanations, examples, and experiments are a well thought out introduction to the Law of Attraction, approached from a unique perspective. So get E-Squared, start experimenting, and see what happens.<br /><br />Note: I received this book for free from Hay House Publishing for review purposes.gy force the same way we think of electricity.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper were very good in their roles. This was the second time I had seen this movie.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Take good actors, put them in great costumes, mix well with superpowers and super villains, and what do you get? An enjoyable movie!
B0087EVHVW|5.0|If you aren't planning on overclocking and you want to play modern games, this processor is more than enough to get the job done and done well.
B0061S0A64|4.0|I have about 5 hours into this application. Over the course of a year that is. My big annoyance last year was that you couldn't work on more than one song. My big annoyance this year is that this thing is not really good for much of anything beyond novelty. Seriously, hear me out. It's not really a random music generator or an ambient tone generator or something and it is not a real music sequencer either. Its just like a sound maker, I guess. That's all well and good and its fun and all, for a bit anyway, but after a short amount of time, that \\"fun\\"  did wear off for me when I discovered that the noises and tunes that I could make are rather limited at best. Maybe it's me, but I doubt it.<br /><br />I give this application four stars in the hopes that it will continue to get better over time (and decide what it's actually going to be).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Epic<br /><br />Best book I have ever read<br />Skydoesminecraft<br /><br />Scmows<br />A real man's business epic awesome a dest book ever man
B00000D9TQ|5.0|The CD arrived in mint condition and the delivery time was speedy! Now we can dance to our soon to be wedding song (Groovy kinda love) every night of the week (in preparation-woohoo)<br />Thank you!
B00004OCQ2|4.0|Wow,<br />Most bands would love to have a fully planned, released album be as good as this.<br />The fact that this music was created amid all the turmoil is amazing.<br />I have just recently been introduced to the music of Jake E. Lee and Badlands.<br />At the time this music was out, I had moved on to alt/grunge scene.  Too bad for me.<br />IMHO this release is better than their debut by a bit.  The maturation here is amazing.<br />Buy a copy before they disappear.
B005544V6A|5.0|I like the characters in this show. Harvey is a fantastic manipulator, and Mike has one of those minds that keep you in awe throughout the show. Throw in Donna and Lewis, and a few others, and you have a great courtroom drama/comedy that doesn't really focus too much on the courtroom.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a big horror movie fan so I have been following &#34;The walking dead!&#34; since day one!  If you like Horror movies and Zombies this is a good show to watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is great!I play it all the time and the update is so cool u get buckets and cake it's just great it's worth every single cent and I would recommend it greatly I would give billions of stars so in conclusion .... BUY THE FREAKIN APP ALREADY!!!!!
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I bought this album as a last chance for this band because of all the bad records released over the last few years.  To be honest, I don't care whose to blame for the breakup or whose to blame for all of those worthless records.  I just wanted to hear great music and they delivered!  Although they add a few extra live songs at the end, the album is noticibly short.  Other than that, I'm glad I stuck around for one more time.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The restoration is superb and once again we get to see these classics as they were intended.<br />The value made this a must buy for me.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Had great variety with puzzles. A good puzzle game that kept me playing at least. The room searches were my favorite
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This would have probably been better for me if I had not already listened the book, and almost all of James lee Burkes other novels. As it was, it was good but left out a lot of nuance that the book kept you guessing with. I can listen to Will Patton read soup label's all day, but with Burkes books it is a wonderful experience.
B007MDB71O|5.0|With the almost non-existent publicity at the time of the launch, I almost missed what is now one of my favourite movies. Sadly I missed it on the big screen....I had the impression it was a kiddie movie. It's a great story that any fan of sci fi should not miss.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, but it is still a great actions/adventure flick. Some parts of it are a little dated -what was state of the art special effects 20 years ago isn't quite up to today's standards, but that being said its still definitely a must-see. Spielberg at his best and awesome soundtrack as well
B005HED08I|4.0|Just good classic sci-fi, well made with solid writing & an attempt to establish characters. Have to remember made in the 1960's, but good non-the-less.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This DVD captures the MJ in his prime. Before the white skin,before the soap opera life.  He is pure mesmerizing.  I saw the same concert tour in Denver in March 1988, so it brought back a lot of memories.  Memories of him being &#34;The Man&#34; at the top of his game.  He was pure magical.  The DVD is a must have for any fan!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|We bought this game for my husband for Father's Day, after playing it a few times with friends.  The game itself is intensely fun to play with a group of friends, with a different ending every time.  I love that, even as a newbie, I have a chance at staying competitive with the guys.<br /><br />Our game came completely shrink wrapped and new, however, it was missing one of the outer edges of the board, the &#34;water&#34; with a port.  My husband was too eager to play to bother with returning it, but it does make it a little annoying, as the board shifts a little easier without that one piece.  I have not figured out a way to rectify the situation.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|great chemistry between the team members, and some incredible plot lines.  This show keeps evolving - just great if you like this kind of stuff.  Not for the faint of heart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's an awesome game but compared to the Xbox version it does not have a lot of blocks there are zombies creeper enderman spider zombie pigmen and skeletons but in a mod you can get blazes
B008M34INW|5.0|Well written, well acted, well thought out non-stop action movie.  Buy or rent this movie today you will not be sorry.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|New Review<br /><br />The Problem is fixed. And I again will say this is a fun, cute game with terrific graphics. Remember it can be addicting, but not harmful to your health.<br /><br />I have enjoyed Bunny Mania immensely since I got it a few days ago as the faotd for my Kindle fire. But now I too receive the stopped message. I will upgrade the rating and give a great review if this problem is resolved. The game has great graphics and is very addicting and cute.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I've always eaten lots of wheat products but after reading this book I cut way back and have noticed a weight loss and that tire around the middle is getting thinner after just one month.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! It is very easy to play! Fun for all ages! I really enjoy playing!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great to have all of the films in a collection--not 8 separate cases. It's a nice set. Received as described in good condition.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME SOO MUCH GRAPHICS ARE GREAT EVERYONE SHOULD GET THIS! ADORABLE! I LOVE THIS GAME SOO MUCH AHHHHH!
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Its a okay game I enjoy playing games like this. There is so many cool games like these to play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome you should get it they have many new features like a pipeline and a minecart it is a great sequel to the first one.
B00CLZ48FA|1.0|A horrible mess of a story. At no point was movie even remotely enjoyable. Just a bad movie all around.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Highly recommended!!! I watched Despicable Me 2 first with my kids and I actually loved it and decided to watch this one too. Love it!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time now. Just a greqt game. Beats Subway Surf and Temple Run any day.
B00AVFO41K|5.0|This game is a fun distraction on the easy level.  The medium and hard levels require some concentration and game-planning, so I'm happy using the easy level during the boring parts of watching baseball games.<br /><br />The instructions are obviously written by someone for whom English is not their first language, so basically, this is how you play:<br /><br />The gameboard is a grid and, at the start, a few of the grid cells have a colored ball in them [most of the colors are shown in the graphic above for the game].  You click on a ball and an empty space and the ball will move to that space if it has a clear path [cells without balls in them].  The object is to get 5 balls of the same color in a line, horizontally or vertically.  When you do, the line of balls will disappear.  If the ball that you move isn't the one that completes the five-in-a-row line, two new balls of random colors will appear in a random grid cell.  [It's 2 balls in the easy level, more in the harder levels].<br /><br />One of the ball colors is like the one in the center of the game graphic - it is multi-colored and is like a wild card; you can use it to complete any color line.  Some of the balls have arrows in them.  Use them in the color line of the same background color of the ball and when the line disappears, the arrow takes out all balls in its way to shoot off the grid.  Some have bombs that will take out balls in the grid around it.<br /><br />According to the instructions [I think this is what it was trying to say], you can never clear the board [beat the computer].  You get points for clearing the balls and all you can do is try for a better score in subsequent games.  The game ends with you losing once all the grid is filled with balls that you couldn't connect.  I don't see this ever happening on easy mode, but it can on the harder ones.<br /><br />I think this is a fun game that can be played on different levels:  easy for a little fun distraction or medium/hard for those thatwant to really think about the moves ahead, like a chess match.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Its a fun game I wenjoy playing games like this. There is so many cool games like thes to play.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|You have played angry bird then the same fits. I mean how else can you do the same thing but different names
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|The second season they were still getting their feet wet and made tons if mistakes and worked great as a team
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Downloaded this for my neice and she loves it. It is easy to use and a lot of fun.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I did not start watching Castle until season three. I finally decided to get the early seasons on DVD. What a treat. The Castle/Beckett relationship is so much fun to watch. The scripts are consistently good and the cast and scripts make it never boring. I am enjoying seeing the early episodes and getting to know how it all came about.
B000AY74OG|5.0|My one 18 months son love it very funny and fun to wach with the family and friends I'm enjoyed
B008478VE8|5.0|Don't believe what others say about Darwin. Instead, read it for yourself. It's a tough read but well worth the effort.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. I would read the series again. I would recommend this book and series to everyone. Read it. Now
B009KEN87O|5.0|old time fun.  no glitches or hidden fees. just great game play.  you won't be disappointed.  very refreshing and nostalgic.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I bought this as a gift but got to download it, too....great deal.  Van sounds as great as ever.  If you are a fan then buy this!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I'm a book worm. I even have a bachelor's degree in English so I've read a lot. I can confidently say this to be my favorite book now when people ask me. Why? Mostly because it's morals and values align with mine but also the literary genius of it. The characters are phenomenal, the voice, just everything. I'm buying a hard copy and will be sure that my daughter's read this one day.
0857208748|5.0|As usual, Vince Flynn captivates you with the story of Mitch Rapp.  These stories will be treasured and re-read.  With sadness, I acknowledge the recent passing of author Vince Flynn.  One of the best authors and a great man.  He will be missed!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once you start reading these three books you can't put them down. The books were great and  I think the books told a<br />beautiful love story. No real love story is with out its ups and downs.  They both were very strong willed and each made<br />there own choice.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|in one of the latest installments of the sigma force series. &#34;the eye of god&#34; is another thriller that questions what we know and what we think we know. you won't be disappointed
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Great story and setting. Sometimes I laugh so hard and other times, it's like Really??<br />Wonderful period show. Glad to get it on Amazon Prime.
B003U4UOP4|5.0|Just getting to finish all these seasons after 6 years haha.<br /><br />Great shows! Can't beat it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Must watch!
B0061S0A64|3.0|April 2012 showing by the reviews.<br /><br />This is getting sad now.<br /><br />Amazon are you running out of apps to use?
B00E193TM2|5.0|Perfect blend of heavy hitting music with good harmony in the songs. The combination of Ivan and Marie Brink's voice in &#34;Anywhere But Here&#34; is just fantastic.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love it , this game makes you think and really pay attention to what you are doing.I think<br />it really challenges me for a while then I get good at it, I play this one a lot.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Wonderful book.  Great characters and great story.  Loved it again.  And again.  Very good cast.  Especially Alan Alda.  He was perfect for this story.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a great game but on the kindle some updates don't even come out.  Name tags came out at the beginning of this summer . It's the end of summer and it still hasn't come out yet.

B00CWY76CC|3.0|Lots of puzzles, brain teasers and deductive reasoning.  Enjoy playing with my husband.  Harder than it looks.  Yep yep yep
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Wool Omnibus Edition. It is a highly imaginative and intelligent world filled with vivid prose which creates a sense of urgency to unravel the story. The characters are engaging and their struggles gripping in this post apocalyptic saga of survival, good vs evil, and truth vs ignorance. I can't wait to read more!<br /><br />It sparks the same ponderings that books like \\"Alas Babylon\\" set into motion. Job well done!
B008PZ69T8|4.0|Nice CD for classical music.  Not over the top with drama, so not disruptive either for quiet listening.  My favorite Shades of Grey album of the series.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|Fantastic DVD, kept the toddlers enthralled for days and days. And great to get the little LEGO figure, Lego and Batman never grow old.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great movie, enjoyed the acting as well as the plot. Worth watching again. I would even consider buying this movie
B0090SI4LU|1.0|I dont think i can put into words just how bad this movie is. If i could give it a half star i would. I am an avid Sci Fi fan, i still read real books, and i usually only asked to be if not entertained, at least subjected to something thought provoking.<br /><br />This movie had great potential, started to be entertaining AND thought provoking, and then gurgled, belched something foul smelling and died a horrible death.<br /><br />The feel good, cant we all get along, only by being hollywoods definition of \\"enlightened\\" do we rise to full human potential was disturbing, disgusting, and made this movie bad. The aliens invaded our planet, and our populace, yet the sum of this movie tells you that it doesnt matter how many lives were lost, and how much suffering humanity endured, because in the end, we can hold (proverbial) hands with them, and end up singing Kuumbaya.<br /><br />Dont waste your money, if you have to see it rent it from Redbox, or search your neighbors trash can, where this waste is sure to be.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|mY FIVE YEAR OLD SON AND i WERE LAUGHING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE. wHEN THE CREDITS CAME ON i REALIZED THE DAD VAMPIRE WAS aDAM sANDLER, NO WONDER WE WERE IN TEARS. tHE STORY WAS VERY CLEVER AND THE CHARACTERS WERE GREAT!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Many episodic series programs degrade over time because the quality of the writing doesn't seem to continue through the years. But, that's not the case with Downton Abbey. The subtle humor and contrast of characters in this series is what keeps me and my husband returning each season. We were disappointed, however, (spoiler beware) that two of the beloved characters decided to call it quits! Let's hope the writing and quality of acting in season 4 keeps up with seasons past and will help us forget the losses.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I had seen this in the theatre but wanted to have a copy at hand. I favor many of the movies with British actor as they are able to go on & not judged strictly by age.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|It was great to see Macgyver again. I will be watching more of season 1 and then on to season 2.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was an absolutely captivating book I couldn't put it down. I was hoping for a better ending but it was also well suited.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app.It's so much fun. I love that it goes to different places every month.I have so much fun playing this.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Good movie; moral point. Would recommend; heartwarming, entertaining...all that kinda' stuff...watched it without children in the room and I still liked it
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book was wonderful. This was on the school book list, and I decided to give it a try. Each character has something that anyone can relate to, and it is beautifully written. This book has many twists and turns, but it all flows smoothly. This book is fabulous for all ages.
B00A09VWVW|4.0|given the author's fame, many might rightly want to sample his writing, and this was, for me, a good read, as the edition was nicely priced by amazon for kindle.
B002XXNSF6|2.0|Pointless story; lousy acting.  I wasted my time and money watching this.  I was really disappointed.  Two drifting souls tried to find some anchor in their lives.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Sensational! This book is a must read. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it brought back a few memories of World war 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game. I got the game on my kindle fire HD and I could not stop playing it. You should really get it to!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game it's just like mario but almost even better me and my little brother are addicted to the Leps world 1 and 2. Leps world 2 is so better than 1.
B00CTERB2A|5.0|This show is terrific! One epsiode could be all comedy, another is a murder mystery, the third could be a drama. Its great to see a show with such flexibility! Each character is believable and someone you want to know more about. I hope that in later seasons there is more development of the side characters. i cant wait to watch the next episode!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Where to start, the setting- magnificent, the acting- outstanding, the various plot lines- intriguing, everything you could want from a mini-series. We want more!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Hilarious and very moving movie. It will make you feel all good inside! and it is based on a true story! What else could I say but Watch IT!
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Probably one of the most intriguing, gripping and readable science fiction books I have ever read. If one had enough time, this book could easily captivate readers enough to have them read it back-to-back. It however still shows enough depth, character development and darkness to deserve a more contemplated reading.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this was a most enjoyable game. makes you really think about what you observe. could keep you busy for hours or just a few minutes while waiting somewhere.  looking forward to more levels.
B0058RCVYS|4.0|Excellent movie, well-acted with real character depth. definitely a quality drama The plot is unusual with many twists and turns and the ending was a complete surprise. The opening sequences in India were done with a hand-held camera so expect some camera - shake, but overall even cinematography was good. Definitely a chick-flick but highly enjoyable.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|If Richard Pryor made a film with Eddie Murphy I suspect it would be a movie like Ted. Where Richard is on voice over duties and Eddie is the actor played by Mark Wahlberg. Ted is the most fowl mouthed teddy bear you can imagine. The amazing thing is what he says is so over the top you are dying with laughter!!! This is a crazy smart movie- just brilliant!!!
0486274268|5.0|An excellent collection of a wide variety of animals, a great starting place for any artist trying to draw animals.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Easy to use.  I do not like complicated applications so this works out great for me.  I have used it many times since I downloaded.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is literally the best game you can get on the kindle. its so addicting that you'll be playing for hours!!! Don't get any of the copy-offs get the real game. its worth the 7 bucks
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|Best StS album yet, IMHO.  I actually discovered this band when they released a track or two from it before the release date, and I immediately preordered their previous two albums, &#34;Collective&#34; and &#34;Carving Desert Canyons.&#34;  I listened to those first two albums while I waited for &#34;The Migration,&#34; and while they're both GREAT instrumental progressive rock/metal albums, &#34;The Migration&#34; is another accomplishment in and of itself.  Well done, StS.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Great film if you are into psych thrillers! Streamed very well through Amazon.  I would def. recommend this film to others
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This is how a story with a weird plot twist should be made!!! Great visuals, great performances by the actors and even greater storytelling. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is for anyone from 8 to 100 years old. I dare you to not love this book! An easy, engrossing and magical read that left me smiling and crying and just happy to be alive.
B00DCX08MW|2.0|This game is confusing and hard. There is only three levels,and the instructions are not clear. Please do not waste your time. Good luck enjoying it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you ever wanted to know what it is like to be in a battle or how  a Navy SEAL sniper operates this is an awesome read!  What an incredible talent and American hero. This book will not disapoint.
B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|Reminds me of the &#34;good 'ol days&#34; of prog rock.  They use synth, jazz influences, etc.  Reminds me of Yes and similar bands, but has harder metal influences as well reminiscent of more modern prog rock bands.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Such a  funny and fabulous book about a horrible disease.  Green manages to show the reader the utterly human story behind the terminal cancer diagnoses of 2 teenagers and their friends.
B001O6W9QC|2.0|I heard Tom cruise does this bit in the film where he plays this nasty character- something Grossman. So I watched the movie hoping to be entertained by some decent actors doing something different and out of character from typecasting. Well- this film supports the argument for typecasting having value in keeping an actors career alive. You never want to see any of these actors perform the roles they have in this film again!!!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|As a soldier, your sworn duty is to go and neutralize the enemy of your country.  Most of the time that means killing them and sometimes capturaing them.  There are times on the battlefield however when your indiviual conscience must take over.  It's a fine line and some will always critisize and/or have a differant point of view.  The soldier has to live with himself.  This one illustrated in the story seems to have worked out.
B002RN2S62|4.0|my 8 yr old daughter loved it!  great message for kids.  Simple humor and lots of adventures, overall good movie
B00AB7HESI|5.0|You have to get this game please its fun if you beat ever level you can get a pack thats fun also it kinda hard but get i now i know its a dollar but get it
B008FVZHKO|5.0|Not as good as In Absentia, IMHO, but pretty good.  A must-have for Porcupine Tree fans I think.  The first song however, the eponymous track... I don't like it.  At. All.  Not sure why it got so much praise.  It's VERY cliche, not very original, frantic, and sloppy in comparison to the rest of the album.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|X-men has always great stories, and this one is no different.  I'd highly recommend adding this to any ones collection.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I grew up a Sherlocke Holmes fan and have seen so many variations on this story. This is a welcome addition.
B00062RCBW|5.0|One of the great things about star trek is that its a view of the future of humanity that is mostly optimistic and noble. Kind of a nice relief from all the dark, dis-topia and apocalyptic movies/TV series...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wonderful in every respect!  Every bit as riveting as the first book in the trilogy, &#34;The Fall of Giants&#34;.  Can't wait for book three to be published!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Watchnthe movie at the local cenima and now I owned this blu-ray. This is my 111th blu-ray collection. When it comes to Bruce Willis' movies .... It is always smashing and this particular one is packed with action.
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|I only have 2 Riverside albums so far, so my sample size is pretty small.  Still, the first album I purchased, &#34;Anno Domini High Definition,&#34; is a much better representation of what I want from prog rock and metal.  I'm not saying this album is bad- I'm not even saying it isn't great.  Don't get me wrong.  The lack of an extra star in my review score is simply because the particular style of this album didn't impress me as much as &#34;Anno Domini High Definition&#34; did.  In the latter album, there was greater use of synths and other effects that harken back to the earlier days of prog, when the greats like Yes and King Crimson were... well... king.
B008Y5UADK|2.0|I just couldn't get into this movie so I didn't watch the whole movie maybe the movie got better but if it doesn't grab me in the first very mins. of the story line not for me
B00A7CI82I|4.0|The thrill is gone. This is a nice movie and Jeremy Renner does a competent job, but the plot has reached the end of its useful life. Plus, as a Bourne fan since my adolescent days I prefer Matt Damon's portrayal of the character.
B003UESJJC|5.0|Love this nicely packaged Blu Ray edition, about time we saw the original aspect ratio that people like me have been waiting for. Another movie to my worthy collection, the sound formats are well mixed. Visually stunning cinematography and incredible direction from Coppola himself.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|The first movie was amazing and the other two were not better than the first.This collection provides a good extra material that you could understand and reflect this wonderful movie.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This was a nice relief from what currently masquerades as Sci Fi these days. Great story, thin characters that allowed the story to shine thru and CGI that added to the story, rather than taking over from it.<br /><br />I mention the CGI because when CGI is done right, it makes you want to have the device, be in the story and believe in the future tech. Too many movies these days have a story that falls flat on it's face, Then tries to make up for that with CGI.<br /><br />Oblivion is CGI done just right, adding to this complex, but yet simply told story that will never fail to surprise you too. Watching it for the second time tonight!<br /><br />From a writer's point of view, this is the retelling of the Moses story. When you watch this. look for the shapes that we know well from Egypt, the idea of Moses stopping the abuse of a slave by an over-seer and some other images that will tell you more. Won't spoil this for you, but there is more than meets the eye, in Oblivion's imagery.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I love this album.  Don't hear a lot of oldschool-sounding doom metal anymore.  I was worried this would be like Ozzy's solo work (which I like), but with the remaining members of Sabbath backing him up instead of his usual band.  NOPE.  This is Black Sabbath, baby.  They're back.
B004RLEBTY|4.0|If you're a fan of Mastodon you really need this album, I saw them on tour a while back and they are absolutely amazing. I cannot wait for their new CD in October!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Nothing heady about his movie, it means no harm and just aims to entertain. It delivers on what it was meant to do.
3899554698|5.0|This book is an amazing coffee table book, and will leave people flipping back and forth through it, and earnestly looking at it. It offer a series of maps of various destinations, but from different artists and map makers perspectives. It's fun to see the difference between two maps of the exact same area, for what parts each person chose to highlight in their making of them.
B009P0U7H2|1.0|Ostensibly written for the layman, this book has no logical structure, does not explain its terms and only serves to confuse the issues with which it attempts to deal. I question whether even a theoretical physicist could follow its tortuous path.<br /><br />Whether or not the Higgs boson, or field, provides mass, it is not until 38% through the Kindle version that the concept of mass is even mentioned. Prior to that the author merely lays one confusion on another, giving names of individual particles and families of particles without adequately discussing any of them. Similarly their properties are stated with no explanation of what these statements mean e.g. What is mean by spin, eV and if a particle is really an aberration in a field how can that disturbance in the field have any spin at all?<br /><br />Within this confusing muddle, the author pads out his material with personal references, anecdotes of his childhood activities, stories of clowns of whom one is unlikely to have heard and, in one such story, replaces a reference to Mrs. Thatcher, former British Prime Minister, with reference to a pop singer!<br /><br />I struggled through more of this book than I should have liked, only to see if it improved as it progressed. It did not.<br /><br />I could not recommend this book to anyone, novice or expert in the field alike. Whatever his qualifications, the author gives the impression of not having mastered his subject well enough to be able to communicate it to others. The book fails on every count and is not worth what it costs.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Funny - Hopefully I will get to finish the movie now that Amazon has helped me with my instant video
B00C70FH7M|4.0|Just discovered this band.  Not bad.  not my favorite, but it's pretty good.  I feel like there is too much fusion of different sounds, and that the band is still learning how to better meld these different influences and styles.  I look forward to seeing what they can do as they progress as musicians.
B00847VY92|5.0|I really enjoyed this sequel to Pollyanna. Pollyanna is one of the most memorable characters in children's literature. Highly recommended for fans of the first book.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Visual effects and amazing action sequences are what this film is about and it surely does not disappoint. Skip the acting, storyline and other stuff- just enjoy the roller coaster of visual effects.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|What a waste of my money and time. I want my money back.<br />Why are these kind of moves made?
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I read the Infernal Devices series first and fell in love. Now I'm getting in deeper with the Mortal Instruments series. City of Bones was a great kick off with a great set of characters and a much anticipated story line. I can't wait to see where this series leads! Thank you Cassandra Clare for sharing these characters with us!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game.it's on every device I have every new upgrade makes this game better.. very excited it's available for kindle
B00B1OWEVC|2.0|Not very good.  Muddy, sloppy, slow, and... just &#34;tired&#34; feeling.<br /><br />Like many, I bought this because of Reznor's attachment to the project.  It's my understanding now that this is more of his wife's project, and he's just following along, which if true makes more sense.  I was so worried we'd lost Reznor at first, but now that NIN has a new album coming out -the first single for which sounds good- I'm anxiously awaiting to hear whether or not the work on this album inspires him to stray too far from the journey he's been on with NIN for so long.<br /><br />Lady, whoever you are, DON'T YOKO MY REZNOR.  That is all.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love this game. Its a real challenge., and its a lot of fun. It keeps you going. You got to try it if you think you can handle it.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|As far as the story goes I do not know what to make about this movie. However, the film is so well made and the production value is to tight one can forgive the crazy story. For me, the story is one of those that gets too complicated for its own good. In an attempt to be clever, the plot becomes to smart for its own good and leaves me more confused than entertained. The visual effects and cinematography save this movie, not the story.
B00003CXA2|5.0|It was a very well done movie. I liked the ways that they did the stunts. It is really hard to understand why people treat other people that have special needs. It proves that they can overcome.
1594204217|4.0|A Natural History of Transformation, the subtitle of Michael Pollan's new book, COOKED, suggests that his message is about transformation of both the food to be cooked and the one who cooks as well. Pollan wants to promote the notion of people being not only consumers of food but producers as well. As an organizing principle he makes use of the four basic elements of ancient philosophers, fire, water, air and earth, to discuss food and its preparation.<br /><br />Pollan suggests that an important transformation takes place when one catches, plucks and guts a chicken compared to microwaving a frozen chicken breast. A sense of community with the earth and other people is lost when a family gathers around the microwave: only one dish can be \\"cooked\\" at a time and individual choice does not promote sharing according to the author.<br /><br />Pollan relates cooking to natural history by frequent references to anthropology and evolution as factors in determining what humans have eaten during our long history.  Control of fire and the development of pots and other containers all allowed humans to eat a greater and greater variety of food and helped in the development of larger brains. Humans are animals that cook; no others do! For environmental, social, community and economic sustainability, cooking is the most important thing one can do for earth according to Pollan.<br /><br />To research the four elements and their relationship to cooking Pollen sought expert tutors to guide him in discussing the role of each element. For fire he related to the chefs of whole pigs in North Carolina and other places; for the other elements he teamed up with artisan bakers, cheese makes and brewers to learn how water and air and fungi and microbes all contribute to the preparation of food. It is a fascinating journey.<br /><br />At times Pollan dabbles in speculation about ideas such as the relationship between whole hog cooking and animal sacrifices of ancient times, the choice of bread as Eucharist (why not cheese?) and cultural and physiological aspects of alcohol consumption and the relationship between stinky foods and death, but he really needs to write another book to explore those ideas.<br /><br />The book ends with recipes for each of the four sections including how to make a sourdough culture and an extensive bibliography. Reading will give you a renewed interest in food and cooking. Whether that interest turns to real cooking may depend on how tied you are to microwaving as cooking!as Eucharist (why not cheese?) and cultural and physiological aspects of alcohol consumption and the relationship between stinky foods and death, but he really needs to write another book to explore those ideas.<br /><br />The book ends with recipes for each of the four sections including how to make a sourdough culture and an extensive bibliography.

B001FB55I0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this movie and think it's pretty underrated.  This version looks and sounds great.  It arrived on time and in perfect condition.  I would definitely recommend for all Terminator fans.
B00007KWHP|5.0|One of Yes' best albums, hands-down.  I can't really speak for the remastering, since I don't have an older CD to compare it to.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Easy read and interesting to see what happens to society when zombie apocalypse comes. Too bad the movie is not even close to what the book is.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|This film  was so well made and the story was so gripping, I fell in love with this movie. I consider this movie the Forrest Gump of the decade it was made in, and they do share many similarities. It is a very heartwarming story, and I cannot take away from all the accolades this movie has received.
B005LAJ212|5.0|excellent product, quick delivery, amazing price and I am enjoying every bit of each episode each time I have the chance to see it
B009MYARIK|4.0|Humorous and spirited.  The characters were well developed and it was a fun twist to have the story told from multiple views.  Highly recommend for an easy, quick read.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Before the last update this was easily a 5 star app. This is a daily use app for me even after the update but that is more because there is not a suitable alternative.  The old version was incredibly easy to use and had simple straight forward functionality; nothing flashy.  The new version looks good, it has a slick modern &#34;shell&#34; but it's buggier and less user friendly.  It also has a focus on building pointless reward points for using the app which is just ridiculous.  I want to use the app to check the weather not play some stupid game.  Just one user's opinion.  There is a way to turn that pointless nonsense off but you can tell a good amount of programming energy went towards that inane functionality instead of concentrating on just displaying the weather.  If you never had the old version you'll never know how good it used to be, and will probably have no problem with this new version.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|OK, but not even close to the great albums of yesteryear that Mustaine used to consistently produce.  The last track is pretty good, and there's a couple other gems in there.<br /><br />Funny story: before I knew this was coming out (I ended up purchasing it via preorder), I heard the eponymous track &#34;Super Collider&#34; on the radio.  I turned to my SO and asked her: &#34;is this one of the tracks from that 'Chinese Democracy' album that Axl Rose put out a few years ago that everyone said was so terrible?&#34;  Seriously.  I thought it was Axl Rose.  And, I mean a terrible, washed-up, fat-and-bloated Axl Rose that can't sign or perform on any professional level anymore.  I Googled the lyrics, and when I discovered it was from a new Megadeth album that was being released in a few weeks, I couldn't believe my ears.<br /><br />I ordered a copy, honestly, out of sheer morbid curiosity to try and figure out how Mustaine lost any and all of the power from his voice.  To see what steaming pile of dung this guy was pumping out.  Surely he couldn't be broke yet?  Why would he do this?  Well, at something like $10.99 to preorder I went ahead and honestly I was pleasantly surprised.  Like I said, it's not as good as his past work but it's actually got a few really great tracks.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|One of the books every runner should read, well written and a very nice story. It has changed the way I think about running<br /><br />I would love one day to be able to run like the Tarahumaras
B000ZOW96Y|3.0|I think the stars of the film are tired of this formula movie. What is the phrase,&#34;Dialed in performances&#34; abound in this film. Watch at your own risk.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Even though Adele was a bit under the weather when this was filmed, she sounded and looked amazing. Her voice is strong and powerful but has the ability to make audience members cry. Very few performers have that ability..and the ability to sound better live than in a studio.<br /><br />I can listen to this over and over and never tire of her vocal talent, range, and emotion.
0307271080|5.0|I could hardly put this this down<br />just classic I even enjoyed<br />half of the yellow son<br />but this one was one of my<br />my favorites..<br />very knowlegable info<br />about nigerians culture<br />at times very emotional<br />adichie told very remarkable story
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|Disc arrived on time and in perfect condition.  The movie looks and sounds great and i have no complaints at all.  Got it at a fair price and would definitely recommend to any and all Terminator fans.
006224454X|3.0|This is not literature but it has some positives.<br />Certainly, we cannot expect every book to be great.<br /> \\"Before I Go to Sleep\\" held my attention for 358 pages.<br />Watson has real potential as a writer.  He is<br /> especially good with conversation. He<br />moves the story along at a good pace. However,<br />there were things about this book that<br /> bothered me. Christine, the main character,<br />has amnesia. I doubt that medically there<br />is an amnesia like Christian's.  As soon as she<br /> goes to sleep she loses that day. She, also, loses<br /> everything she has learned about her former life.<br /> Poor Christine is literally always in the dark.<br /> She starts from scratch every morning.<br />  We watch her life unfold as she finds<br /> methods of retaining. The whole plot is implausible,<br />the ending is too fast and too much! However,after<br />all is said, I would once again select this book to read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|so fun. challenging and very nice. I enjoyed it a lot and would tell everyone to at least try it
1451696191|4.0|Even though this book is geared toward young adults, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The issues the book touches on and the emotions it brings out in the reader are profound!  This book is a MUST READ for young adults and seasoned readers as well!! I HIGHLY recommend it.
1616551607|5.0|I have to echo everyone else's thoughts on this collection of art. It is absolutely stunning. I have grown up with Final Fantasy and these books brought back so many memories. There is such strong characterisation in these drawings alone, it is no wonder that these games turned out to be masterpieces. Final Fantasy V and VI take up most of this collection which is no bad thing. It is amazing to see how the look of these characters began and how immediately recognisable they are throughout every game. It is a testament to both Amano and the final game artists to create such strong characters across vastly different media.<br /><br />The quality of the slipcase and books is perfect. Pages are printed beautifully and the slipcase is thick, strong and has real weight. The value of this collection is bewildering, an absolute must have for fans of the series and conceptual character artists.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|I tried this on a Gerber Gator Drop point fine edge knife and it did nothing to it. I think the knife if too thick for this small sharpener. The stick on it is ok and did sharpen it, but thats the only thing that sharpened it. Now i used a Smith's ... i don't know what its called ... but it leaves my knife like a razor blade literally.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This is a lovely story about a man who rediscovers himself by looking at his life and what impacts he's made.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini is an excellent author.  Just as one is starting to pass judgment on a character, one stops and thinks about man's inhumanity to man and vice versa.  The glad-handing brother turned out not to be as superficial as one expected.  The adopted mother's money didn't provide her with happiness.  I have learned so much about Afghanistan from his books, but he also touches on universal themes, which all good writers do.
B00425S1H8|2.0|Does not work with windows 8 with applications written in VB6<br />Works with W8 and hyper terminal so it must be just with the VB6 communication control MSCOMM32.ocx<br />Works with vista and windows 7 with the same application

B000UX6THK|5.0|After mulling over several different options I finally decided on the Gold Box Edition and I'm glad I did.  The whole thing looks great and certainly exceeded my expectations.  The set arrived on time for Christmas and in perfect condition.  The price was great and I'm glad to have it as a part of my home collection.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|Hard to put this book down, grabs the reader from the first chapter. Readers will love this book if into thrillers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|excellent game, not to hard but not to easy, its for the most part just common sense!  the game flows very well worked great on my kindle fire
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I recently got into the shoe during it's third season and wanted to check out the first season. I recommend it to anyone looking for some new shows to watch!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. The kids love the mystery boxes and that the different levels are actually different cities around the world. We've been to Paris and Beijing already! Highly recommend this game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It took me a couple of tries to get into it but when I did I couldn't put it down.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once I started watching could not stop ~ can't wait for PRIME to bring us the next season.  Thanks AMAZON
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show, really sucks you in with action, danger, romance and actors with strange/unusual faces. The kind of faces that you just can't take your eyes off of.
B007RTAR64|5.0|My daughter picked out this doll after Xmas with her Amazon gift card. It was a nice addition to other barbies.

B008KYOCA2|1.0|Not sure what I expected, but the ease of use just isn't there for me.<br />Maybe when I have more time to explore.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game for kids. It is also fun for adults too. Doesn't freeze up at all and is easy to play.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This book came highly recommended by my brother who reads  most of Bryson's books.  My brother and I have same tastes, and I love it, too.  I love Bill Bryson's witty and clever choice of words, phrasing and sentence structure; also, no swear words, violence, etc.  I've asked my brother for another of his favorite books by Bryson so I can order it, too.  I find his writing and stories  very informative, entertaining and great fun.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in ages.  I absolutely love it and am glad I own a little part of my childhood.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 10 because it can be scary in some parts.  Still, I think this movie is timeless and older kids (yes, including those of us who are waaaaaay over 10) will enjoy this.  Maybe a good family night movie?
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I've found this game is incredibly addictive. The only problem is that it ends too soon. I love this game!
B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|I LOVE THIS EP SO MUCH IT'S BEEN ON REPEAT FOR THE PAST 3 DAYS, ALL THE SONGS HAVE A PLAY COUNT OF 70+
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thought provoking, and so much more than just a group of kids killing eachother in an arena. This trilogy is an allegory for the ridiculous greed that blinds Americans to the desperate plights of poverty. A symbol of overcoming power hungry governments. In another time, this may have made the banned list.
034547581X|5.0|I am a very proud Vietnam Infantry Pointman from 1969. I have read 55-60 very good books about the Vietnam war and I consider this to be the best of all. All military veterans, as well as civilians, should read this book. I have now read it twice and I highly recommend it, as well as the movie. You won't be disappointed.
0307237699|4.0|I have many so-call Anti-Obama books and I am looking forward to delving into this book written by our illustrious President, Barrack Obama. As this book has a copyright date of 2006, I expect to get an insight to the ideology and mindset of Obama prior to his election as the POTUS.  The book contains 9 separate chapters, ie....Republicans and Democrats.....Values.....Our Constitution.....Politics 101......Opportunity......Faith.....Race....The World Beyond Our Boarders.....& Family....I come from an Independent Conservative Mindset and I am looking forward to reading this book...Get one for yourself and you decide.
B007MDQW3W|3.0|But something is just... &#34;off&#34; about this CD.  I've listened to it over and over again in the hopes that I will fall in love with it like I have fallen in love with the other CDs, but it just hasn't happened and probably won't.  This sounds strange, but she uses her mouth too much.  Told you that would sound strange.  Basically she makes drum sounds or trumpet sounds (or inhales dramatically in the song called &#34;Open&#34;).  That &#34;mouth music&#34; is very distracting and takes away from the beauty and the genius of her songs.  I love Regina and own all of her CDs so I don't regret buying this one.  I just wont be listening to it as much as I listen to the others.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movie was exciting and all of the Marvel heroes got their props!I can not wait for the next installment.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The kids like the game but they only go so far before they're being asked to make a purchase to continue. I will not spend money blindly so they play the same part everytime. It keeps them busy while I get dinner ready, they really like it, but not trip worthy as purchasing could get expensive.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a fantastic app for magic fans. Very good interface and pleasing timer system. look forward to winning spells!.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|a time when they were at the peak of poularity, very nice video. Older but still, very enjoyable.well worth the cost!
B000BYCAJE|5.0|I bought this on an LP back in the sixties but don't have a record player so when I saw this was available on cd I was thrilled played it not stop since getting it, it took a couple of weeks to arrive but was delighted when it did, thanks
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is very entreating i love it simply as that you should try it.  i am getting addicted playing everyday
B005MMY9A8|3.0|very good picture not slow and good sound.<br />Everything you expect on this movie if you are into<br /> I would recommend Thor to any lover of fantasy films,
B00D9T962M|5.0|Although I've never been to New Guinea, I've learned about the many Birds of Paradise.  I've been aware of this book but hesitated to pay the retail price several years ago.  When the price dropped to $20, I snapped it up.  It is a superb treatise; the authors are commended for taking the time to study and make such marvelous photos.  Outstanding in every way.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|Even for a puzzle challenged player such as myself, this app was short on playtime. Despite having to start over every time I tapped a wrong button, I finished it quickly.  Then deleted it as there is no replay value. I would be mad if I paid, luckily it was a free app.<br /><br />Suggestions to developer: More levels, increasing difficulty such as more colors or tool options, and an undo last move button.<br /><br />As is, probably would be good for a younger child, but not if you have to pay.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the character development,the history,the costumes and period pieces are so accurate!<br />Makes you long for the story to continue!
B002ZFQD0O|4.0|It's no Metallica S&M, but still quite good.<br />Serj gets overly &#34;Broadway&#34; at times (why is he singing like Groucho Marx?) but at others, the mrraige of his voice with the orchestra is beautifully natural
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I hadn't played much Sudoku before this, but I started playing and really loved it.  20 minutes on the bike at the gym never went by so quickly!  Lots of options for play, and it saves your game if you need to stop in the middle.  Excellent!
B008602KQI|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is a pleasure to watch and the story never gets old. Love the books and this movie is well done.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Having waited and waited and waited for this sequel it was a total disappointment. No Baroness, no Scarlett, no Ripcord??? And no explanation as to why?! Killing off the main character so that I can't even go back and enjoy the original was a devestating nail in this coffin. I can't believe I waited all this time and got this in return!!! Terrible experience for long-term die-hard fan of G.I. Joe. Awful, a bit boring and should never have been made if this was the best they could do. No offense to The Rock, he's good in it, typical but good. If you didn't watch Rise of Cobra it's ok because you won't know what you're missing and should have gotten out of Retaliation... I guess. This has left such a sour impression that I can't even forget this debacle of a sequel and act like it never even existed in the 1st place so I could, at the very least, still go back and enjoy the 1st G.I. Joe movie! NOT HAPPY, quite the opposite!!!
1442359315|5.0|It makes sense that we have a body with our senses if we are to belief that we were created for something bigger!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a lot of fun for kids and adults. The horses look almost real! It's easy and fun. My kids ages 7 & 9 love it and so do I. You can even use most of it offline after downloading it!
B00C061I3K|5.0|This might be a little bit premature since we are just past half 2013 but this is probably the best LP I heard so far this year.
B00D41AJ7G|3.0|This is a fun game, but with only 44 levels, and some levels solvable in under 1 minute, it does not have a long play life.  It also created issues with my Toshiba Thrive, making the speakers click when it was asleep -- annoying!  It was nice to play, but I'm glad I didn't pay money for it (FAOTD).
B00425S1H8|5.0|This adapter &#34;just works!&#34; I've worked with USB/serial connections on several computers and communicating is often problematic. But the Plugable adapter worked immediately (with Prolific driver for Mac Mountain Lion). They provided the latest driver from Prolific on their website and on CD-ROM, and instructions were clear. Now my upgraded hardware talks USB/Serial again. Thanks Plugable!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I never knew that Nicola Tesla did so much and with so little money. You only need to be smart enough.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game rocks! It's fun and entertaining. I easily lose track of time when I play. Good thing I don't take this to work cuz I'd be fired for playing too much.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|My favorite people on Castle are his mother (Susan Sullivan) and daughter (Molly Quinn). They are strong characters. I also like Esposito and Ryan very much. I really like that Castle is a writer but I dislike it when he continuously allows Beckett to dangle a carrot in front of his face, making him think he has a chance in a relationship with her. I realize it's to keep the story moving and viewers interested but really? They don't have to marry but they could have a relationship. All it does is encourage them to sleep around with others. Who'd want a relationship with someone like that? Also, I doubt the police would allow him to insert himself into all of their cases as much as he does.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|great movie for all ages. there is a great lesson learned from the movie. my first time seeing this movie. will watch it again.
B008L40Q7E|4.0|My husband suggested this book. I was looking for something different to read. This was just the right book to read this summer.<br /><br />I love the humor and it gave me better insight into M.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Depp and Burton are here again. We've seen it. However, for a decent movie, not bad. I'm a fan of the burton/depp combo, however, much of the shock factor is gone. The story is easy to follow and worth the watch, but if you're looking for hilarious and constant laughs this isn't it.<br />Also, dare I say it? Depp is possibly getting slightly long in the tooth to play the &#34;young man&#34; ...<br />The cast clearly had fun making the film and surprise twists here and there are fun, but again, the creepy, weird, factor that usually can shock etc, is now missing; it's been done.<br />worth the watch, if not the purchase.
0062255657|2.0|Neil Gaiman is an amazing writer.<br /><br />This book isn't amazing.<br /><br />The novel is a too-long-short-story.<br /><br />Take a pass on this book.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I succeeded in finding and also looking up the definitions of the words I wanted to know the meaning of.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Obviously a very good movie, but you know that if you're interested in buying it. So the overall quality is great. Although I don't think I've bought a Blu-ray before that I ended up being dissatisfied with as far as quality goes. Plus I love that you get a lot of bonus features I was really interested in the behind-the-scenes stuff for this film. Great stuff.
B0013ND30M|5.0|i loved this movie as a kid. great for a boy or a girl. i watched it with my oldest grandchildren( one is a boy, the other a girl) and they both enjoyed the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Makes me regret the whole Revolution thing.  What I wouldn't give for a hereditary title or to work for someone with one.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I loved. this game it was so fun to fly around in my favorite suits fighting. aim and super villains such as crymsion dynamo this game is totally worthy of 5 stars
B003CH9PTU|5.0|This is by far one of the best shows I have ever watched. The acting is incredible.  Can't wait for season 2.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Nice book, thnks to mazon for the kindle version<br />Thi is the book everyone should read when they feel thy are succesful
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's alright but not phenomenal.  A hint...use a pen and paper to write down all the numbers, symbols and colors. You'll never remember them all and half the stuff you find is red herrings.  This game is kind of frustrating but it's better than staring at a wall. The most annoying thing is the decoys which you never use.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|i loved this movie as a kid and i still do. classis disney at his best. i loved watching this movie with my oldest granddaughter.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I found this book was a stretch. I don't often read Stephen King, but was intrigued by the reviews. I wouldn't recommend it
B009S5IZJQ|5.0|Zuccherro nails it as usual....His compositions and musicians on this CD are superb!<br />His voice is a raspy velvet comination of blues soul and on this CD latin!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used SwiftKey with my last 5 cell phones, it is clearly the best keyboard out. Definitely worth the money.
B000VX4X54|5.0|Traditional model of Timberland, it fits my feet very well and comfortable! And the price is really affordable, I really love it!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This information was just what was needed to get the formatting and headings done correctly for the Kindle.  Step by step instructions were clear and easy to follow.  The only downside was that Table of Content issues could have been better explained.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|i loved this movie. wonderful songs. great story. truly a classic disney movie.would recommend it to anyone.great family movie just add popcorn.
1451627297|5.0|Again Stephen King knocks one out of the park! I don't want to go crazy, but his might be his best one yet!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Love the game in its entirety, but, there are several glitches like visiting friends, and the size of the pictures in the screen. Also how I have difficulty with trying to finish my challenges, sometimes I will finish my challenge and it takes either several minutes to hours to register in the game its self as I am playing
B009MZQQWA|5.0|Can't believe I only just watched this movie for the first time. It is an incredible thing . . . a true microcosm of movie badness turned good somehow? In the present day it is a little nostalgic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It was the best free program I've seen yet. I downloaded it because my 9-year-old grandson loved the characters from the movie. He now spends most of his time when he is allowed to play nearly rolling on the floor with laughter.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|parts of this movies are hilarious but being that I'm a Malkovich fan I loved it. Can't wait to see Red2
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Great lyricist, talks about real stresses and mentality of most youth males out there. One of the best hip hop artist out there today
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I read the book in one afternoon and overall, its okay. I would not consider myself a devote individual, but I do not refuse to read or hear from those who are. The story is certainly captivating and certainly makes you ask questions, but it doesn't provide answers for those questions. The title was slightly misleading because it posed more questions than it answered, and in my opinion, I understood the story line as &#34;what the heck just happened to me?! what is this place?!&#34; Not, &#34;Here is heaven, this is what it looks like, this is what's there, this what happens when you die&#34; etc. I dunno, it was an interesting read, but I wouldn't read it again. However, I should point out however that he does make some very valid points regarding adoption. If you're adopted, I recommend reading it not for its religious context but his insight regarding his adoption. That alone probably would have been a better story, in my opinion.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Bringing elite musicianship along with some great songwriting. Kotzen's voice is reminiscent of Chris Cornell and he brings some big soul to the album. Sheehan and Portnoy bring the wood as would be expected.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|The book was okay.  The author did not spin anything so that was refreshing.  Very direct.  I cannot think that all of these books ripped off As a Man Thinketh and then Think and Grow Rich.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to be cheered up or needs their heart  moved in a good way. This book takes you on a journey that starts with a shy person who lives in his own not-so-perfect world and blossoms into a perfect wallflower. This was a fantastic book that had you laughing one minute and crying the next. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an inspiring book that will make you smile.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I absolutely love this alarm clock app! Works so much better than I thought it would. You can customize it &amp; use your own music which is awesome. The best part is it's free :) very happy.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I really loved his last album. I did kinda feel like this one was more depressing but still love his music
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|Okay, so I was told that these books were good and that the movies were awesome. So far, quite opposite. I don't find anything relating to mass marketing and exploitation of hunger to be of anything fun or entertaining. It's like Lost, here in America its a game and we can win a million dollars, but there are people, millions of them, where that is not a game, there is no million dollar prize, and that is the crappy life they have to live every day. I see stories like this one just a kick in the face to anybody who has had to go to bed hungry, or can't afford to get enough food for their family, or is starved. It's sad. These books should be ashamed of the desensitization of real world epidemics. It's not a game. It's not entertainment. It's reality, and people live in it daily and seeing others act like it is just a game, its fake, not real, and won't effect affect them is absolutely asinine.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It's slow sometimes pictures don't load or messages y'all needa update the app and it don't let you delete photos
1446303314|5.0|This book is full of whimsical ideas that are lovely. Everyone should surround themselves with fairytales! This book is full of lovely images, easy to follow instructions, and steps for making a special space in your home.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It shows an epic love story. And gives insight into a selfless girl's fight against cancer, I would recommend it to any of my friends.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|I would love to give this album 5 stars, but I can't.  The best material on Omega is excellent, and one song on here bids fair to be the best they ever recorded, but there are some weak stretches that kind of leave you waiting for the next piece before the current one has finished playing.   My original review was posted before I had fully developed a reviewing methodology, so the numeric rankings you see have been slightly altered, though none by very much.  I have added a little more material on some of these songs. Taking it song by song, 1-5:  FINGER ON THE TRIGGER - 4.7.  Classic Asia sound, driving beat and edgy guitar work.  Great opening cut. THROUGH MY VEINS - 4.5. Change of pace, darker and more haunting.  Nice song from Steve Howe. HOLY WAR -  4.3.  Asia has always taken an antiwar stance and this is the most intelligent and listenable song they have written in this idiom.  An extra 1/2 point for rhyming &#34;Agincourt&#34; with &#34;conquistador&#34; without sounding stupid.  EVER YOURS - 3.1 - The album slows down here with a more spiritual ballad that, while heartfelt, leaves me wanting something more.  The one thing that I really like about this song, and what saves it for me, is the obvious humility in the singer's words. LISTEN CHILDREN - 2.3.  Attempts to create an Africanesque spirituality, but it doesn't work for me - but that may be my problem, not theirs.  (I do know that someone should tell John and Geoff that if it's midnight, as the song says, the new moon CANNOT be rising high; the new moon rises at the same time as the sun.) This song really needed a lot more of the cultural elements of African music to really stand out.   END OF THE WORLD - 2.8.  Harder-edged than the previous two, creates a dichotomy between internal and external strife and attempts to resolve it through spiritual assurance in the chorus.  The verses are much better than the choruses are, unfortunately. But at least I don't hit the Skip button on this one anymore. LIGHTTHE WAY - 3.7.  Finally.  There are still a few weaknesses here lyrically but this one really wakes me up after the last three.  Driving tempo, thudding beat, soaring vocal.  Good strong stuff. EMILY (bonus) - 4.2  I don't get why some people have posted such negative remarks about this song.  It's quirky, and a little goofy, and clearly steals something from the Beatles (I kind of picture Father McKenzie being secretly in love with Eleanor Rigby, only to find he's barking up the wrong tree), but so what?  I like it. STILL THE SAME - 4.1.  This one puts me in mind of ELO's &#34;Turn to Stone&#34; in terms of the beat and melody.  Not what I expect from Asia, but good stuff nonetheless. THERE WAS A TIME - 5.0.  With an exclamation point.  The first time I heard this song, I kept thinking of &#34;Open Your Eyes&#34; from Alpha, and I've always connected the two as being endpoints of one relationship.  This is a bitter, sad, angry reflection on a past love affair that hits on every point.  Best song on the album, one of their two best all-time.  I BELIEVE - 4.3.  The album shifts gears again, becoming more hopeful and uptempo.  Anthemic, optimistic song that emphasizes faith without being obnoxious about it.  Asia opened their show with this song on the Omega tour (see &#34;Resonance&#34;) and that was a very smart choice. DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU NOW - 3.3.  If there is one real change in my review, it's here. I didn't like this song for a while, but the obvious Beatle-filching and the laid-back tone finally grew on me.  It's a more mellow ending than I might have liked - like blowing out a candle at bedtime - but that's not all bad. Sleep well.  Bottom line: If you're an Asia fan, get this album.  If you're a more casual listener, go online and give &#34;There was a Time&#34; a listen: I defy anyone to tell me that that song would not have been a huge hit in the 1981-1985 years.  Or &#34;Finger On The Trigger,&#34; for that matter.  Granted, these songs WEREN'T released then, but there is a difference between being behind the curve (see most of the &#34;Aqua&#34; album) and telling the curve to get stuffed, which is what this band is doing now.
B008LC8TJI|4.0|I normally dont listen to maroon 5, but I heard a couple of songs on the radio and figured lemme try it out. Not disappointed at all.
B000002O4X|3.0|The music seems weak compared to what I listened to on the computer.<br />At times I can hardly hear some of the music unless I turn the volume up<br />--it gets too loud in some places.  The computer version seems more like<br />what I experienced in the movie on T.V.  To me it is a poor recording of<br />the soundtrack.
1455523003|5.0|I love the title Christopher Hitchens chose for\\"The Missionary Position\\" (a book which I'm happy to display in my home library). I think it's quite the appropriate jab for that nasty little sadistic troll who gained incredible wealth and fame while shilling for the church of Rome, duping the masses with her extremely misrepresented and despicably inhumane camps of death and misery. Like any diseased prostitute that assumes the missionary position for hire (literally or figuratively), Teresa of Calcutta prostituted herself for profit while making herself and her pimps loads of money at the expense of her desperate victims who's biggest mistake in life was to seek out her (dis)services. Countless poor souls have died from readily curable conditions in these filthy concentration camps which were merely a front for increasing the wealth and fame of it's founder and her surviving pimps.<br /><br />The world is a better place for having been visited for a brief time by the great contrarian and incomparable wordsmith, Christopher Hitchens; I don't think any informed person with the slightest modicum of morality can say anything of the sort about that prostitute of humanity so affectionately referred to by her dupes as Mother Teresa.<br /><br />If you're offended by the title or description of this book (or my review) without having taken the time to read it and examine the claims presented, please do yourself a favor and take the time to acquaint yourself with the evidence presented by Christopher Hitchens or one of countless others (including former members of her death cult) who have exposed the reality of Teresa of Calcutta's \\"missionary work\\".
1451695195|5.0|well this book has changed my mind about the hereafter....excellent read with an incredible report about Dr. Alexander's experience in &#34;the life after death&#34;.  I love that the author was able to weave the story from his childhood all the way to his current life.

B004CLYKLI|5.0|This book was very inspiring and gives me a wake up call as  a teenager. It was very well written and thought out and the characters are very well developed. I simply loved the book.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Love it! I hope to see a sequel soon! Interesting puzzles that are not superhard and keep you playing nonstop.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is fun. It's pretty easy at the beginning, but gets more challenging as it continues. It is never so hard it seems impossible.  I hope there  will be more levels in the future.
B000056N8X|4.0|Seeing as though it seems like reviews from other movies are kind of mashed in here (I saw Endgame reviews on page for The Final Dimension film) I will review briefly each film, as well as make comments about the series.<br /><br />1.Highlander:  This first film is magnificent, why?  Because its one of the best indie films you will ever see, it has a great plot, characters and they did a lot with a small budget.  This film is the basis for the entire franchise, obviously because of all the sequels.  No other film was ever able to replicate the magic.<br /><br />2. Highlander: The Quickening:  This is the oddball in the franchise, only die hards really enjoy it why?  Because it makes Immortals into Aliens!  It was just simply a dumb concept, and because of this bad reception from the audience Highlander III: The Final Dimension was an attempt to cancel out this hiccup.  The problem is no fan will ever be able to get this nasty taste out of their mouth.  Another reason why it didnt work is because the writers of the first one made it so the gathering and the endgame happened in the first one, later sequels gave fans a headache because suddenly we are all thinking, \\"wait didnt Connor win in the first one? it said in that movie that was the endgame and now there are all these sequels\\"  I did like the action in this film, and any die hard fan has to have it.<br /><br />3.  Highlander: The Final Dimension:  In this one Connors adopted son (immortals cant have children) gets kidnapped by an immortal hunting Connor Macleod.  This was supposed to be the film that went back to the formula from the 1st film, writers asked us to just forget about Highlander II and went back to the basics.  I will say this movie is better then the 2nd one, the action is great and we all still love the concept of immortal sword fights fighting to the death to release the quickening and move closer to the endgame.<br /><br />4.  Highlander: Endgame:  This movie, personally is my favorite of the film franchise, but you have to get the extended Directors Cut.  It has extra scenes that the theatrical doesnt have and doesnt change the plot.  I love this film because it mixed Adrian Paul's Duncan Macleod from the TV series into the mix.  Duncan Macleod was simply a B.A. and it was refreshing to see him on screen doing what he does best, playing immortal Duncan Macleod.  The movie is action packed, more than previous efforts and has all those great historical flash backs we all know and love.  My only criticism is the girl that plays Kate/Faith Duncans ex wife who is another immortal, her acting was absolutely awful, probably why she hasnt done a well known film since.<br /><br />5.  Highlander: The Source:  watched this on the Sci Fi channel, its the only real stinker in the franchise, like way worse the Highlander II.  Please for all things sacred and holy in this world please don't put yourself through this movie, you will want that hour and half back.  It was so bad the critics and fans alike could actually agree on something, this film was trash.  However because it was trash and I am such a huge Highlander fan, I hope they come out with one last good movie to try to wash out the bad taste.  Cmon guys this isnt the way to end it!  Pull a Highlander III!  We will forgive you!<br /><br />Highlander The Series:  This is how I started on Highlander, I remember coming home when I was 13 and watching re runs on TNN and now Spike TV.  Some people really say a lot of trash about the show, dont know why it was awesome.  Season Six was the only really bad season, and thats just because the writers were trying so hard to start a spin off (eventually becoming the Raven) that they had a lot of episodes without their main character, Duncan Macleod...this was a huge mistake.  Audiences really felt connected to Macleod over 5 seasons, and then in the last season they dont even have him in every episode?  Unfortunately I hear a lot that Adrian Paul just lost interest in the role for season six so thats the reason for the bad reviews.  Thats too bad if its true, he really was a great action star with sword fights, martial arts, and a comedic edge that just made Highlander fun to watch.<br /><br />Highlander: The Raven:  The creators tried to continue with the immortal Amanda from the series, it just didnt work without a Macleod and the series ended after one season.  I tried watching this on Sci Fi one or twice, sometimes they have re runs early in the morning...it just didnt have spark are the chemistry between actors as the series.<br /><br />Overall the franchise is great, not because every film or series is awesome but because they have a great concept.  Who wants to live forever?  In the end There Can Be Only Onead reviews.

1401322786|5.0|read all of mitch's books...so am very sure I will love this book too....he is an excellent author....will read soon
B000FBJHZS|3.0|I ask that question because this book is definitely an engaging read but, like all his other books I've read, so clearly aimed at being made into a movie. Now don't get me wrong, I love movies. But I also love the art of the novelist. When I say Brown's books are  written for the screen, I basically mean they are all about what happens. There is little delving into the difficult-to-film depths of what his characters are feeling or thinking, or into their motivations and emotions. As I said an engaging read. A great novel? Not really.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Like I said above, awesome show! If you like DC or just hero's in general you'll like this show. Some things are irritating about the characters (if you follow the comics like I do, you'll see) but soon you're able to over look them. Other than that 5/5 for this show.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It's a story of a father whose love for his son won't allow him to see his son's faults and a mother who is made to feel guilty because she can. She, too, deeply loves her child but realizes he is a danger to others and needs her husband to help her take action to get help.
B0061S0A64|5.0|Device Tested: Kindle Fire HD 7\\"<br /><br />I absolutely love this app. As a music major, I have been looking for an outlet for my musical creativity  form on the Kindle Fire, and I have found it!<br /><br />This is a very fun styled music app. The backdrop for this app is a keyboard, and whatever keys you place nodes on are the sounds you hear. There are three colored music generators and one percussion generator that you can place on any of the keys. To make the sound, you connect the generators using the different colored sound nodes. The different colors can be used to change the overall color blend of the scene.<br /><br />This app offers quite a few features to enhance the experience.<br /><br />- The node menu allows you to adjust the movement of the nodes and generators, enable gravity which causes everything to fall downward on the screen, and control the speed of the movements.<br /><br />- The audio menu allows you to change the key of the music, change the octave of the keyboard backdrop, change the type of scale used for the music, and adjust other things like echoing effects and how the notes are played.<br /><br />- The rhythm menu lets you alter the tempo of the music and the note values for each beat. In addition, you can sync the generators so they all go off at the same time.<br /><br />Other features:<br /><br />- Recording option<br /><br />- An option to save the current layout you are working on<br /><br />- Several pre-made template layouts to listen to and/or mess with and readable<br /><br />- Ability to switch between landscape and portrait mode<br /><br />- Sleep timer options<br /><br />- Ability to close the app and leave the music running.<br /><br />So, as you can see, this app has a lot to offer. I do understand, though, that this app may not be for everyone, as it's not the greatest music app to ever be created. That being said, it's still a 5 star app in my book. For those of you who like being creative, I highly recommend this app.<br /><br />- Sam

And after &#34;Coco&#34;, I began listening to Stravinsky's work ... nice going, Mads .. no wonder you were knighted ... you jump started the Danish film industry (here in the U.S. ..

B009XIXVU6|4.0|The story line deals with what happens to an entire poverty stricken family in Afghanistan when a little girl is sold to a rich family. She is sold to an irresponsible woman who divorces her husband and later commits suicide at the age of forty-four. The girl grows up very confused about her past, forgetting her past family, even though she was sold at age six. She knows something is wrong about her relationship with her mother and father, but her mother never tells her the truth. It is only when she is in her sixties and her niece comes looking for her because her older brother was so torn up about losing her all his life, that she learns the truth about her past history. She learns that every member of her family suffered for a lifetime for the shame of having sold her.<br /><br />This book is by the author of Kite Runner. To me, that was a five star book. This one has some of the same pathos of the poor in Afghanistan but is slow in some parts.

B00BVYKWJI|4.0|I am watching both Borgia productions currently running (this one on Amazon & the one on Netflix).  While I feel that they are both equal in production value, etc... Jeremy Irons Pope Alexander is hands down superior to John Doman's.  If I could take the actors portraying Cesare & Rodrigo from the Netflix version & put them into the Amazon one, I'd give this production 5 stars.

0452273331|1.0|*The Fountainhead* may be summed with the axiom, \\"In a kingdom of the blind, a one-eyed man is king.\\"  To Rosenbaum (\\"Rand\\"), the normal man who wishes to live within his means and exercise his creativity is a hero on a world of avarice and intellectual (read: \\"liberal\\") oppression.  The problem is she thinks integrity and creativity belong only to conservatives and evil oppression only to liberals.<br /><br />Amazingly, in this story, the aesthetic independence of the individual outweighs even property rights.  Did she defend graffiti artists from charges of vandalism?  Doubtful.<br /><br />Her criticisms of self-sacrificing moralities are valuable, but the rest is just \\"I'm special because I'm normal in a world of evil liberals.\\"  If you hate liberals, you will enjoy this book, because it (as does *Atlas Shrugged*) presents liberals as Soviet caricatures that will feed your stereotypes.<br /><br />It's unfortunate, because parts of it are well written.  It's what she's saying that is the problem.
B00DU16OJM|5.0|When I first heard about this from a facebook post I went to guyclark.com to listened to it for free and boy was I blown away! I've known about Guy Clark since the 70's,mostly from his songs that Jerry Jeff Walker recorded and had always considered him a talented song writer but never listened to his albums much but since hearing this one and listening to others on his web site I now know what I've been missing.This CD covers a wide range of topics and styles of music and every song is well worth listening to.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The show is awesome, it has drama, comedy, love and sex...and of course law. I'm not a lawyer, but I really appreciate this show because it portrays Harvey who is a narcissist and a complete douche to everyone and his associate Mike who is a fake lawyer but learning from his mentor Harvey. It's really a teaching show, how can someone adapt with a lie.

B0061S0A64|3.0|Sorry, but if you create an app with a gazillion options, you should explain how it works or make it very intuitive.<br />I compared it to the only comparable program, and that is Plasma Sound.<br />It has fewer options but at least a tutorial.<br />In the app I'm reviewing right now, the symbols won't always light up to show your setting choice on Kindle Fire HD, and the menu as such isn't very organized either.<br />Example: If I choose the wave form, the chosen one lights up.<br />If I choose the key, it doesn't, though it changes the key.<br />This app is complex with no instructions. What planet did you import it from?<br />It has potential but needs a manual and the shortcomings fixed.

B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Very believable, credible movie about family angst, life challenges, mixed martial arts (MMA) and integrity. I would recommend it to anyone, with the caveat that there is some graphic violence in the several fight scenes throughout the movie.<br /><br />Both of the Conlon brothers/protagonists, as well as all of the fighters, looked the part of MMA fighters, and definitely showed some 'moves' that added realism to the story line. The fight scenes were not gratuitous, contributed to propel the plot forward, and underlined the tension and grit of the goals that drove the competitors. They were done very well to capture the brutal, painful essence of fighting for a living, and the very real, inherent dangers of the fight game.<br /><br />The end was somewhat inevitable, and still it was rewarding to watch to the conclusion, and provided a very good message for ethics and morals in American society.
0061950726|1.0|I don't know if the book is really good--I will finish reading it when the terrible voice of the reader leaves my head. The book is written partially in the voices of a young girl and adolescent girl, and the reader sounds like Alvin the Chipmunk.  Don't waste your $4 on whispersinc on this one!
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is one of the greatest films I have ever watched. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, the settings/landscapes completely majestic.

0871403633|5.0|This is one of the most important books I've read in a long time. It lays out the fundamentals of humanity's biological and social evolution on this planet. Wilson states that humans are \\"by any conceivable standard...life's greatest achievement...are the mind of the biosphere, the solar system, and--who can say?--perhaps the galaxy.\\" But we are creatures who have at once \\"...created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and god-like technology. We thrash about. We are terribly confused by the mere fact of our existence, and a danger to ourselves and to the rest of life.\\"<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, Wilson discusses eusociality, a stage of social evolution in which \\"group members are made up of multiple generations and are prone to perform altruistic acts as part of their division of labor.\\" Humans are among the relatively few species on the planet ever to have evolved to a level of eusociality. (So are ants and bees, which are not given short shrift in the book.)<br /><br />The main argument Wilson proposes is that eusociality has evolved by \\"group selection\\" and NOT by \\"inclusive fitness\\" (kin selection). Inclusive fitness was the accepted wisdom from around the 60s to the 90s. It says that, \\"kinship plays a central role in the origin of social behavior. In essence, it says that the more closely related individuals in a group are, the more likely they are to be altruistic and cooperative, hence the more likely are the species that formed such groups to evolve into eusociality.\\" Inclusive fitness has \\"powerful intuitive appeal\\" but does not hold up to scientific scrutiny and mathematical evaluation, he argues.<br /><br />Group selection, on the other hand, proposes that it is hereditary altruists forming \\"groups so cooperative and well-organized as to outcompete nonaltruist groups.\\"<br /><br />In the end, Wilson argues that human eusociality is a product of multilevel natural selection. \\"At the higher level of the two relevant levels of biological organization, groups compete with groups, favoring cooperative social traits among members of the same group. A the lower level, members of the same group compete with one another in a manner that leads to self-serving behavior. The opposition between the two levels of natural selection has resulted in a chimeric genotype in each person. It renders each of us part saint and part sinner.\\" (p. 289)<br /><br />The other important concept that is covered is that of \\"gene-culture coevolution,\\" which deals with the causal relation between the evolution of genes and the evolution of culture--briefly, that \\"many properties of human social behavior are affected by heredity... and that the innate properties of human nature must have evolved as adaptations.\\"<br /><br />I've used mostly quotes from the book in writing this review because I didn't want to get it wrong. A couple of the chapters were difficult reading for me, so I read and re-read and looked stuff up on the Web to get a better understanding. It was definitely worth the effort.<br /><br />This book should be one of the basic starting points for everyone who is interested in how humanity might understand itself better in order to leave aside some of the beliefs that are causing us to do so much damage.o relevant levels of biological organization, groups compete with groups, favoring cooperative social traits among members of the same group.

Especially the part of the story about the flight to Antigua on a private jet is not up to his old standard – not even believable. The rest of the story is easy-going and entertaining. chr

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Love this game took awhile to get it, but now the game doesn't allow me to do the missions unless I buy to skip the missions. So I set up my personal missions and am happy with that.

1451626096|2.0|I had problems with this book from the beginning.  I think the author twisted facts to give a modern sex drama aspect to an old story.<br />Would a princess close to a throne have the freedom to lose her virginity in those days?  Would such a princess commit adultery with her UNCLE, the king?<br />Would she still entertain deep love for this uncle who probably killed her brothers to assure his throne?<br />Beyond that, would the new king actually rape his potential queen with an audience in the next room?<br />Why would a mother curse her daughter's promised husband with the death of first born sons (her grandchild!) and the end of a dynasty?<br />I don't like any of the characters in this book. According to this book, the only goal of the rulers, courtiers and especially mothers is to make a king who could give them favors.  No one is happy.  No one cares about anything other than gaining  titles.<br />Why waste time reading a depressing book that twists facts to make history worse than it actually was.

B00CZAYNOC|1.0|With a name like Five Finger Death Punch and an album titled The Wrong Side of Heaven & the Righteous Side of Hell, I was expecting some really good heavy metal.  Unfortunately, the name of the band and the title of the album are misleading, because this sounds more like something from Little Girls Slapping on the album I love Hello Kitty.  OK, maybe I am exaggerating, but this is a really weak album.  The lyrics are pathetic.  I found myself wishing the singer would grow a pair, and stop sounding like such a whiny little boy.  And the music that went with the lyrics didn't make it any better.  I came away thinking these guys don't know how to play very well, and didn't really seem to want to do anything more than play ballads.  If this is the best heavy metal, then heavy metal is dying.

B008602KQI|4.0|I read the trilogy a year and a half ago and did not want to be disappointed with a movie that would not or could not compete, but as a Prime member, I decided to watch the movie. I was glad I waited so long after reading The Hunger Games because all the details of the novel were not fresh in my mind and as a result, I found myself enjoying the movie instead of picking it apart. Once the movie was finished, I found myself hoping that the next two novels in the trilogy would be made soon. In fact, if given the opportunity, I would watch this movie again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First of all, this is not a trilogy about BDSM, it is a love story. So if you are looking for a kinky BDSM story, you will be disappointed. There is a LOT of mostly vanilla sex--a really lot, but it is only between Ana and Christian exclusively. If you are not willing to commit to the entire trilogy (1520 pages), then do not start the series. The first book is 380 pages and the other two roughly 600 pages each. But they are easy reads. I am 51% in the second book. I will write a complete review when I finish the trilogy.<br /><br />The ending of book 1 is a very low point in the story when Ana leaves Christian,  but the second books begins exactly where the first ends and quickly moves on. They are apart for about 5 days, when Ana cannot stay away from Christian. He is truly one f****d up dude, but with good reasons. Very few people would have survived what he endured in the first 4 years of his life and no one would have built an multi-billion dollar empire befire he is 30. Christian earns $100,000 a minute (put the numbers to that to see how many billions that is a year!) Yet he is an empty shell of a man.<br /><br />Ana is beyond enamored with him, yet she refuses any gifts from him for a very long time. She is TOTALLY not interested in his money at all. She struggles to maintain her independence, while quickly falling deeply in love with him, despite his very dark side. The biggest struggle is in helping him become a normal person who believes in love and that he deserves anything good. The first highmpoint in book 2 is when he can tell Ana he loves her (a man who has believed that there is no way he is worthy of loving and being loved!<br /><br />The epilogue in book 3 is probably the happiest ending I have read in years. So know of you endure, you will be happy with the final outcome! This is a trilogy that I can barely put down, but one that I do not want to finish. I am a literature major and once felt that style and form and all that crap were very important. Now I know that the author has done her/his job if you fall in love with the main characters and do not want to leave them in the end. Ms James has done that in spades. i wish she would write other books about the lives of other characters with Christian and Ana still in the story. But she could not top this story, so we have to leave Ana and Christian in their fairy tale ending!<br /><br />One of the best stories I have ever read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's really fun and competitive against your friends needs More ways to collect coins . Made me kinda upset when it updated cause I worked so hard to get bananas and it changed on me but still really fun and love the new locations

1451626096|5.0|The White Princess by Philippa Gregory features Elizabeth of York in this \\"Cousins' War\\" series of books by the author. Filled with political intrigue, drama, and real historical facts, this novel is one that fans of historical fiction should definitely check out!<br /><br />The White Princess is another fine addition the \\"Cousins' War\\" series of books based on the historical events of the royals in England during the late 1400s. Philippa Gregory is one of the best authors of this time period that I have read, and she does not disappoint with this novel.<br /><br />This is the story of Elizabeth of York, the daughter of the \\"White Queen\\" who is forced to marry Henry Tudor to end the civil war that had been going on for almost two decades. She seems to be one of the pawns in the story, and a bit clueless on how things work around her. However, she is still an important person in the series who should not be forgotten.<br /><br />Historical fact and fiction is weaved together to make this story (and all of Gregory's novels in the series) extremely interesting and real page turners. You can really see the passion and love of this time period when reading her novels, and that to me is a huge bonus to her works of art. If history classes were this interesting, I'm sure people would have learned more, and gotten better grades! I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of The White Princess, Touchstone, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.

B00005JKC3|4.0|The cast fits the characters perfectly if you ask me and the special fx were good but the movie lacks excitment. I also think the Hulk should have looked more detailed with his body in this movie and Eric Banas trasformation into the Hulk could of been better. Besides that this movie was good. N E way I rather have Eric Bana play the Hulk rather than Edward Norton. He fits the part better.

If we dwell upon it, and do not try to get beyond it.\\" Zettel p312-314<br /><br />These quotes are not chosen at random but (along with the others in my reviews) are an outline of behavior (human nature) from our two greatest descriptive psychologists. In considering these matters we must keep in mind that philosophy (in this context)  is descriptive psychology.<br /><br />Over 40 years ago I read a small grey book with metaphysics in the title which began with the words \\"Metaphysics is dead.  Wittgenstein has killed it.\\" I am one of many who agree but sadly the rest of the world has not gotten the message. Shoemaker's work is nonsense on stilts but is unusual only in that it never deviates into sense from the first paragraph to the last. At least with Dennett, Carruthers, Churchland etc one gets a breath of fresh air when they discuss cognitive science (imagining they are still doing philosophy). As W showed so beautifully, the confusions that lead to metaphysics are universal and nearly inescapable aspects of our psychology. They occur not only in all thinking on behavior but throughout science as well. It's easy to find examples in Hawking, Weinberg, Penrose, Green, who of course have no idea they have left science and entered metaphysics, that the statement they just made is not a matter of fact at all but a matter of conceptual (linguistic) confusion. \\"Law, event, space, time, force, matter, proof, connection, cause, follows, physical\\", etc., all have clear uses in certain technical contexts, but these blend insensibly into quite different uses that have little in common but the spelling.<br /><br />Since it is pointless to waste time deconstructing Shoemaker line by line, showing the same errors over and over, I will describe some facts about how our psychology (language) works and with this outline and the references I give it is quite straightforward to give a meaningful description of the world in place of the metaphysical fantasies. If I were to debate Shoemaker we would never get beyond the title. As noted above \\"The decisive movement in the conjuring trick has been made, and it was the very one we thought quite innocent.\\"  The trick is already apparent in the title and if we let that slip the nonsense will never stop.  \\"Physical realization\\" can be taken many ways and most of the time it is being used here in very peculiar ones.  Likewise for many other words,and W saw these tricks and dissected them in great detail beginning mainly in the Blue and Brown Books and continuing for the next 20 years.<br /><br />Here is how the leading Wittgenstein scholar summarized his work: \\"Wittgenstein resolved many of the deep problems that have dogged our subject for centuries, sometimes indeed for more than two millennia, problems about the nature of linguistic representation, about the relationship between thought and language, about solipsism and idealism, self-knowledge and knowledge of other minds, and about the nature of necessary truth and of mathematical propositions. He ploughed up the soil of European philosophy of logic and language. He gave us a novel and immensely fruitful array of insights into philosophy of psychology. He attempted to overturn centuries of reflection on the nature of mathematics and mathematical truth. He undermined foundationalist epistemology. And he bequeathed us a vision of philosophy as a contribution not to human knowledge, but to human understanding - understanding of the forms of our thought and of the conceptual confusions into which we are liable to fall.\\"--Peter Hacker--'Gordon Baker's late interpretation of Wittgenstein'<br /><br />To this I would add that W was the first to clearly and extensively describe the two systems of thought--fast automatic prelinguistic S1 and the slow reflective linguistic  dispositional S2. He explained how behavior only is possible with a vast inherited background that is the axiomatic basis for judging and cannot be doubted or judged, so will (choice), consciousness self, time and space are innate true-only axioms.  He noted in thousands of pages and hundreds of examples how our inner mental experiences are not directly describable in language, this being possible only with terms that substitute for public behavior (the impossibility of private language). He  invented truth tables and predicted the utility of paraconsistent logic. He patented helicopter designs which anticipated by three decades the use of blade-tip jets to drive the rotors and which had the seeds of the centrifugal-flow gas turbine engine, designed a heart-beat monitor, designed and supervised the building of a modernist house, and sketched a proof of Euler's Theorem, subsequently completed by others.  He can be viewed as the first evolutionary psychologist since he constantly explained the necessity of the innate background and demonstrated how it generates behavior. He described the psychology behind  the Wason test--a fundamental measure used in EP decades later. He noted the indeterminate nature of language and the game-like nature of social interaction. He described and refuted the notions of the mind as machine and the computational theory of mind, long before practical computers. He decisively laid to rest skepticism and metaphysics. He showed that, far from being inscrutable, the activities of the mind lie open before us, a lesson few have learned since.<br /><br />In addition to failing to make it clear that what they are doing is descriptive psychology, philosophers rarely specify exactly what it is that they expect to contribute to this topic that other students of behavior (i.e., scientists) do not, so after noting W's above remark on science envy, I will quote again from Hacker who gives a good start on it.<br /><br />\\"Traditional epistemologists want to know whether knowledge is true belief and a further condition ..., or whether knowledge does not even imply belief ... We want to know when knowledge does and when it does not require justification. We need to be clear what is ascribed to a person when it is said that he knows something. Is it a distinctive mental state, an achievement, a performance, a disposition or an ability? Could knowing or believing that p be identical with a state of the brain? Why can one say `he believes that p, but it is not the case that p', whereas one cannot say `I believe that p, but it is not the case that p'? Why are there ways, methods and means of achieving, attaining or receiving knowledge, but not belief (as opposed to faith)? Why can one know, but not believe who, what, which, when, whether and how? Why can one believe, but not know, wholeheartedly, passionately, hesitantly, foolishly, thoughtlessly, fanatically, dogmatically or reasonably? Why can one know, but not believe, something perfectly well, thoroughly or in detail? And so on - through many hundreds of similar questions pertaining not only to knowledge and belief, but also to doubt, certainty, remembering, forgetting,observing, noticing, recognising, attending, being aware of, being conscious of, not to mention the numerous verbs of perception and their cognates. What needs to be clarified if these questions are to be answered is the web of our epistemic concepts, the ways in which the various concepts hang together, the various forms of their compatibilities and incompatibilities, their point and purpose, their presuppositions and different forms of context dependency. To this venerable exercise in connective analysis, scientific knowledge,psychology, neuroscience and self-styled cognitive science can contribute nothing whatsoever.\\" (Passing by the naturalistic turn: on Quine's cul-de-sac- p15-2005)<br /><br />I will offer some comments on philosophy and its relationship to contemporary psychological research as exemplified in the works of Searle (S) and Wittgenstein (W). It will help to see my reviews of PNC (Philosophy in a New Century), TLP, PI, OC, Making the Social World (MSW) and other books by and about these two geniuses, who provide a clear description of higher order behavior, not found in psychology books, that I will refer to as the WS framework.<br /><br />To serve as an heuristic framework I have generated the following table of INTENTIONALITY based on a much simpler one from S and which owes much to W.<br /><br />..................................................THINKING.(COGNITION)(No gaps)...................WILLING.(VOLITION)(3 gaps)<br />....................................PREFERENCES*....EMOTIONS...MEMORY...PERCEPTION..DESIRES..IAA**...ACTIONS/WORDS<br />Cause Originates From...........World.............World.........World.......World............Mind......Mind...............Mind<br />Causes Changes In................None..............Mind...........Mind........Mind..............None.....World.............World<br />Causally Self Referential***....No.................Yes.............Yes..........Yes...............No.........Yes.................Yes<br />True or False (Testable)..........Yes................T only.........T only.......T only...........Yes........Yes.................Yes<br />Describe a Mental State..... ....No.................Yes.............Yes..........Yes...............No.........Yes.................Yes<br />Evolutionary Priority...............5...................4................3.............1..................5............2....................2<br />Information to/from World......No.................From...........From........From.............No.........To...................To<br />Voluntary Content.................No..................No..............No/Yes.....No.................No.........Yes................Yes<br />Voluntary Initiation...............Yes/No............No...............Yes..........No...............Yes/No.....Yes...............Yes<br />Tversky/Kahneman **** .......2...................1.................1.............1..................2/1..........2...................2<br />Change Intensity...................No.................Yes.............No............Yes..............Yes..........No................No<br />Time and Place *****............TT.................HN..............HN............HN..............TT...........HN................HN<br />Special Quality......................No................Yes..............No............Yes..............No............No...............No<br />Localized in  Body..................No.................No...............No............Yes..............No...........Yes..............Yes<br />Bodily Expressions................Yes................Yes..............No............No...............Yes..........Yes...............Yes<br />Self Contradictions................No.................Yes.............No.............No...............Yes..........No................No<br />Needs a Self........................Yes................Yes..............No.............No...............Yes..........No................No<br /><br />*Dispositions or Inclinations-- Beliefs, Understanding, Knowing, Intentions, Prior Intentions, Abilities, Capacities etc.<br /> ** IAA--Intention In Action  *** Mental State instantiates--Causes or Fulfills -Itself  ** **  (1= Intuition, 2=Reason)  ** **  * There and Then, Here and Now<br />A major theme in all discussion of human behavior (e.g. metaphysics etc) is the need to separate the genetically programmed automatisms from the effects of culture. All study of higher order behavior is an effort to tease apart not only fast S1 and slow S2 thinking (e.g., perceptions and other automatisms vs. dispositions or abilities to act), but the logical extensions of S2 into culture (S3).<br /><br />Searle's work as a whole provides a stunning description of higher order S2/S3 social behavior due to the recent evolution of genes for dispositional psychology, while the later W shows how it is based on true-only unconscious axioms of S1 which evolved into conscious dispositional propositional thinking of S2.<br /><br />S1 is the simple automated functions of our involuntary, System 1, fast thinking, mirror neuron, true-only, non-propositional, prelinguistic mental states- our perceptions and memories and reflexive acts including System 1 Truths and UA1 --Understanding of Agency 1-- and Emotions1- such as joy, love, anger) which can be described causally, while the evolutionarily later linguistic functions are expressions or descriptions of voluntary, System 2, slow thinking, mentalizing neurons.  That is, of testable true or false, propositional, Truth2 and UA2 and Emotions2 (joyfulness, loving, hating)-- the dispositional (and often counterfactual) imagining, supposing, intending, thinking, knowing, believing, etc. which can only be described in terms of reasons (i.e., it's just a fact that attempts to describe System 2 in terms of neurochemistry, atomic physics, mathematics, make no sense--see W,S,Hacker etc).<br /><br />Disposition words have at least two basic uses. One is a peculiar philosophical use (but graduating into everyday uses) which refers to the true-only sentences resulting from direct perceptions and memory, i.e., our innate axiomatic S1 psychology (`I know these are my hands')--i.e., they are Causally Self Referential (CSR), and the S2 use, which is their normal use as dispositions, which can be acted out, and which can become true or false (`I know my way home')--i.e., they have Conditions of Satisfaction (COS) and are not CSR.<br /><br />The investigation of System 1 has revolutionized psychology, economics and other disciplines under names like \\"cognitive illusions\\", \\"priming\\", \\"framing\\", \\"heuristics\\" and \\"biases\\". Of course these too are language games so there will be more and less useful ways to use these words, and studies and discussions will vary from \\"pure\\" System 1 to combinations of 1 and 2 (the norm as W made clear), but not of S2 only, since it cannot occur without involving much of the intricate S1 network of \\"cognitive modules\\", \\"inference engines\\", \\"intracerebral reflexes\\", \\"automatisms\\", \\"cognitive axioms\\", \\"background\\" or \\"bedrock\\" --as W and later S call our Evolutionary Psychology (EP).<br /><br />The deontic structures or `social glue' are the automatic fast actions of S1 producing the slow dispositions of S2 which are inexorably expanded during personal development into a wide array of automatic universal cultural deontic relationships (S3). I expect this fairly well describes the basic structure of behavior.<br /><br />So, recognizing that S1 is only upwardly causal (world to mind) and contentless (lacking representations or information) while S2 has content and is downwardly causal (mind to world) (e.g., see my review of Hutto and Myin's `Radical Enactivism'), I would change the paragraphs from S's MSW p39 beginning \\"In sum\\" and ending on pg 40 with \\"conditions of satisfaction\\" as follows.<br /><br />In sum, perception, memory and reflexive prior intentions and actions (`will') are caused by the automatic functioning of our S1 true-only axiomatic EP as modified by S2 (`free will'). We try to match how we desire things to be with how we think they are. We should see that belief, desire (and imagination--desires time shifted and decoupled from intention) and other S2 propositional dispositions of our slow thinking later evolved second self, are totally dependent upon (have their COS originating in) the CSR rapid automatic primitive true- only reflexive S1. In language and neurophysiology there are intermediate or blended cases such as intending (prior intentions) or remembering, where the causal connection of the COS with S1 is time shifted,as they represent the past or the future, unlike S1 which is always in the present. S1 and S2 feed into each other and are often orchestrated seamlessly by the learned deontic cultural relations of S3, so that our normal experience is that we consciously control everything that we do. This vast arena of cognitive illusions that dominate our life Searle has described as `The Phenomenological Illusion' (TPI).<br /><br />It follows both from W's 3rd period work contemporary psychology, that `will', `self' and `consciousness' are axiomatic true-only elements of S1 composed of perceptions and reflexes., and there is no possibility (intelligibility) of demonstrating (of giving sense to) their falsehood. As W made so wonderfully clear numerous times, they are the basis for judgment and so cannot be judged. The true-only axioms of our psychology are not evidential.<br /><br />Like Carruthers and others, S sometimes states (e.g., p66-67 MSW) that S1 (i.e., memories, perceptions, reflex acts) has a propositional (i.e., true-false) structure. As I have noted above, and many times in other reviews, it seems crystal clear that W is correct, and it is basic to understanding behavior, that only S2 is propositional and S1 is axiomatic and true-only. They both have COS and Directions of Fit (DOF) because the genetic, axiomatic intentionality of S1 generates that of S2 but if S1 were propositional in the same sense it would mean that skepticism is intelligible, the chaos that was philosophy before W would return, and in fact if true, life would not be possible. As W showed countless times and biology demonstrates, life must be based on certainty--automated unconscious rapid reactions. Organisms that always have a doubt and pause to reflect will die-no evolution, no people, no philosophy.<br /><br />I would translate S's summary of practical reason on p127 of MSW as follows: \\"We yield to our desires (need to alter brain chemistry), which typically include Desire -Independent Reasons for Action (DIRA--i.e., desires displaced in space and time), which produce dispositions to behavior that commonly result sooner or later in muscle movements that serve our inclusive fitness (increased survival for genes in ourselves and those closely related).\\" And I would restate his description on p129 of how we carry out DIRA2/3 as \\"The resolution of the paradox is that the unconscious DIRA1 serving long term inclusive fitness generate the conscious DIRA2 which often override the short term personal immediate desires.\\" Agents do indeed consciously create the proximate reasons of DIRA2/3, but these are very restricted extensions of unconscious DIRA1 (the ultimate cause). Obama and the Pope wish to help the poor because it is right but the ultimate cause is a change in their brain chemistry that increased the inclusive fitness of their distant ancestors.<br /><br />Evolution by inclusive fitness has programmed the unconscious rapid reflexive causal actions of S1 which often give rise to the conscious slow thinking of S2 (often modified into the cultural extensions of S3), which produces reasons for action that often result in activation of body and/or speech muscles by S1 causing actions. The general mechanism is via both neurotransmission and by changes in neuromodulators in targeted areas of the brain. The overall cognitive illusion (called by S `The Phenomenological Illusion', by Pinker `The Blank Slate' and by Tooby and Cosmides `The Standard Social Science Model') is that S2/S3 has generated the action consciously for reasons of which we are fully aware and in control of, but anyone familiar with modern biology and psychology can see that this view is not credible.<br /><br />A sentence expresses a thought (has a meaning), when it has clear COS, i.e., public truth conditions. Hence the comment from W: \\" When I think in language, there aren't `meanings' going through my mind in addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought.\\"And, if I think with or without words, the thought is whatever I (honestly) say it is as there is no other possible criterion (COS). Thus W's lovely aphorisms (p132 Budd) \\"It is in language that wish and fulfillment meet\\" and \\"Like everything metaphysical, the harmony between thought and reality is to be found in the grammar of the language.\\" And one might note here that `grammar' in W can usually be translated as `EP' and that in spite of his frequent warnings against theorizing and generalizing, this is about as broad a characterization of higher order descriptive psychology as one can find.<br /><br />Though W is correct that there is no mental state that constitutes meaning, S notes that there is a general way to characterize the act of meaning-- \\"Speaker meaning... is the imposition of conditions of satisfaction on conditions of satisfaction\\" which means to speak or write a well formed sentence in a context that can be true or false and this is an act and not a mental state.<br /><br />Hence the famous quote from W: \\"If God had looked into our minds he would not have been able to see there whom we were speaking of (PI p217)\\" and his comments that the whole problem of representation is contained in \\"that's Him\\" and \\"...what gives the image its interpretation is the path on which it lies,\\" or as S says its COS. Hence W's summation (p140 Budd) that \\"What it always comes to in the end is that without any further meaning, he calls what happened the wish that that should happen\\"...\\" the question whether I know what I wish before my wish is fulfilled cannot arise at all. And the fact that some event stops my wishing does not mean that it fulfills it. Perhaps I should not have been satisfied if my wish had been satisfied\\"...Suppose it were asked `Do I know what I long for before I get it? If I have learned to talk, then I do know.\\"<br />Disposition words refer to Potential Events which I accept as fulfilling the COS and my mental states, emotions, change of interest etc. have no bearing on the way dispositions function. I am hoping, wishing, expecting, thinking, intending, desiring etc. depending on the state I take myself to be in-- on the COS that I express and which can only be expressed by reflexive S1 muscle contractions, especially those of speech.<br /><br />This is another statement of W's argument against private language. Likewise with rule following and interpretation --they can only be publicly checkable acts. And one must note that many (most famously Kripke) miss the boat here, being misled by W's frequent referrals to community practice into thinking it's just arbitrary public practice that underlies language and social conventions. W makes clear many times that such conventions are only possible given an innate shared axiomatic psychology which he often calls the background.<br /><br />W's definitive arguments against introspection and private language are as clear as day--we must have a test to differentiate between A and B and tests can only be public. He famously illustrated this with the `Beetle in the Box' as noted p191 of WAP. I have explained the functioning of dispositional language (`propositional attitudes') and W's dismantling of the notion of introspection above and in my reviews of Budd, Johnston and several of S's books.  Basically he showed that the causal relation and word and object model that works for S1 does not apply to S2.<br /><br />W famously rejected behaviorism and much of his work is devoted to describing why it cannot serve as a description of behavior. \\"Are you not really a behaviourist in disguise? Aren't you at bottom really saying that everything except human behavior is a fiction? If I do speak of a fiction, then it is of a grammatical fiction.\\" (PI p307) But real behaviorism is rampant in its modern `functionalist', `computationalist','dynamic systems' forms.  See my review of Carruther's `The Opacity of Mind' for a recent egregious example.<br /><br />Behaviorism etc. have no practical impact.  Unlike other cartoon views of life, they are too cerebral and esoteric to be grasped by more than a tiny fringe and it is so unrealistic that even its adherents totally ignore it in their everyday life.  Unfortunately not so with other cartoon theories like SSSM, BS and TPI, widely shared by religions, governments, sociology, anthropology, pop psychology, history, literature, and mom and dad, in spite of well known facts, such as that personalities of adults adopted as children are as different from those of their adoptive siblings and parents as people chosen randomly off the street.  Religions big and small, political movements, and economics often generate or embrace already existing cartoons that ignore physics and biology (human nature), posit forces terrestrial or cosmic that reinforce our superstitions, wishful thinking and selfishness and help to accelerate the destruction of the earth (the real purpose of nearly every social practice).  The point is to realize that these fantasies are on a continuum and have the same source. All of us are born with a cartoon view of life and few ever grow out of it.  But the world is not a cartoon, so a great tragedy is being played out as the cartoons collide with reality.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that most of the above has been known to many for decades (and even ¾ of a century in the case of some of W's teachings), I have never seen anything approaching an adequate discussion in behavioral science texts and commonly there is barely a mention. This is truly sad but it is absolutely scandalous that the same is true of most philosophy texts.sions of S2 into culture (S3).<br /><br />Searle's work as a whole provides a stunning description of higher order S2/S3 social behavior due to the recent evolution of genes for dispositional psychology, while the later W shows how it is based on true-only unconscious axioms of S1 which evolved into conscious dispositional propositional thinking of S2.<br /><br />S1 is the simple automated functions of our involuntary, System 1, fast thinking, mirror neuron, true-only, non-propositional, prelinguistic mental states- our perceptions and memories and reflexive acts including System 1 Truths and UA1 --Understanding of Agency 1-- and Emotions1- such as joy, love, anger) which can be described causally, while the evolutionarily later linguistic functions are expressions or descriptions of voluntary, System 2, slow thinking, mentalizing neurons.

Organisms that always have a doubt and pause to reflect will die-no evolution, no people, no philosophy.<br /><br />I would translate S's summary of practical reason on p127 of MSW as follows: \\"We yield to our desires (need to alter brain chemistry), which typically include Desire -Independent Reasons for Action (DIRA--i.e., desires displaced in space and time), which produce dispositions to behavior that commonly result sooner or later in muscle movements that serve our inclusive fitness (increased survival for genes in ourselves and those closely related).\\" And I would restate his description on p129 of how we carry out DIRA2/3 as \\"The resolution of the paradox is that the unconscious DIRA1 serving long term inclusive fitness generate the conscious DIRA2 which often override the short term personal immediate desires.\\" Agents do indeed consciously create the proximate reasons of DIRA2/3, but these are very restricted extensions of unconscious DIRA1 (the ultimate cause). Obama and the Pope wish to help the poor because it is right but the ultimate cause is a change in their brain chemistry that increased the inclusive fitness of their distant ancestors.<br /><br />Evolution by inclusive fitness has programmed the unconscious rapid reflexive causal actions of S1 which often give rise to the conscious slow thinking of S2 (often modified into the cultural extensions of S3), which produces reasons for action that often result in activation of body and/or speech muscles by S1 causing actions. The general mechanism is via both neurotransmission and by changes in neuromodulators in targeted areas of the brain. The overall cognitive illusion (called by S `The Phenomenological Illusion', by Pinker `The Blank Slate' and by Tooby and Cosmides `The Standard Social Science Model') is that S2/S3 has generated the action consciously for reasons of which we are fully aware and in control of, but anyone familiar with modern biology and psychology can see that this view is not credible.<br /><br />A sentence expresses a thought (has a meaning), when it has clear COS, i.e., public truth conditions. Hence the comment from W: \\" When I think in language, there aren't `meanings' going through my mind in addition to the verbal expressions: the language is itself the vehicle of thought.\\"And, if I think with or without words, the thought is whatever I (honestly) say it is as there is no other possible criterion (COS). Thus W's lovely aphorisms (p132 Budd) \\"It is in language that wish and fulfillment meet\\" and \\"Like everything metaphysical, the harmony between thought and reality is to be found in the grammar of the language.\\" And one might note here that `grammar' in W can usually be translated as `EP' and that in spite of his frequent warnings against theorizing and generalizing, this is about as broad a characterization of higher order descriptive psychology as one can find.<br /><br />Though W is correct that there is no mental state that constitutes meaning, S notes that there is a general way to characterize the act of meaning-- \\"Speaker meaning... is the imposition of conditions of satisfaction on conditions of satisfaction\\" which means to speak or write a well formed sentence in a context that can be true or false and this is an act and not a mental state.<br /><br />Hence the famous quote from W: \\"If God had looked into our minds he would not have been able to see there whom we were speaking of (PI p217)\\" and his comments that the whole problem of representation is contained in \\"that's Him\\" and \\"...what gives the image its interpretation is the path on which it lies,\\" or as S says its COS. Hence W's summation (p140 Budd) that \\"What it always comes to in the end is that without any further meaning, he calls what happened the wish that that should happen\\"...\\" the question whether I know what I wish before my wish is fulfilled cannot arise at all. And the fact that some event stops my wishing does not mean that it fulfills it. Perhaps I should not have been satisfied if my wish had been satisfied\\"...Suppose it were asked `Do I know what I long for before I get it? If I have learned to talk, then I do know.\\"<br />Disposition words refer to Potential Events which I accept as fulfilling the COS and my mental states, emotions, change of interest etc. have no bearing on the way dispositions function. I am hoping, wishing, expecting, thinking, intending, desiring etc. depending on the state I take myself to be in-- on the COS that I express and which can only be expressed by reflexive S1 muscle contractions, especially those of speech.<br /><br />This is another statement of W's argument against private language. Likewise with rule following and interpretation --they can only be publicly checkable acts. And one must note that many (most famously Kripke) miss the boat here, being misled by W's frequent referrals to community practice into thinking it's just arbitrary public practice that underlies language and social conventions. W makes clear many times that such conventions are only possible given an innate shared axiomatic psychology which he often calls the background.<br /><br />W's definitive arguments against introspection and private language are as clear as day--we must have a test to differentiate between A and B and tests can only be public. He famously illustrated this with the `Beetle in the Box' as noted p191 of WAP. I have explained the functioning of dispositional language (`propositional attitudes') and W's dismantling of the notion of introspection above and in my reviews of Budd, Johnston and several of S's books.  Basically he showed that the causal relation and word and object model that works for S1 does not apply to S2.<br /><br />W famously rejected behaviorism and much of his work is devoted to describing why it cannot serve as a description of behavior. \\"Are you not really a behaviourist in disguise? Aren't you at bottom really saying that everything except human behavior is a fiction? If I do speak of a fiction, then it is of a grammatical fiction.\\" (PI p307) But real behaviorism is rampant in its modern `functionalist', `computationalist','dynamic systems' forms.  See my review of Carruther's `The Opacity of Mind' for a recent egregious example.<br /><br />Behaviorism etc. have no practical impact.  Unlike other cartoon views of life, they are too cerebral and esoteric to be grasped by more than a tiny fringe and it is so unrealistic that even its adherents totally ignore it in their everyday life.  Unfortunately not so with other cartoon theories like SSSM, BS and TPI, widely shared by religions, governments, sociology, anthropology, pop psychology, history, literature, and mom and dad, in spite of well known facts, such as that personalities of adults adopted as children are as different from those of their adoptive siblings and parents as people chosen randomly off the street.  Religions big and small, political movements, and economics often generate or embrace already existing cartoons that ignore physics and biology (human nature), posit forces terrestrial or cosmic that reinforce our superstitions, wishful thinking and selfishness and help to accelerate the destruction of the earth (the real purpose of nearly every social practice).  The point is to realize that these fantasies are on a continuum and have the same source. All of us are born with a cartoon view of life and few ever grow out of it.  But the world is not a cartoon, so a great tragedy is being played out as the cartoons collide with reality.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that most of the above has been known to many for decades (and even ¾ of a century in the case of some of W's teachings), I have never seen anything approaching an adequate discussion in behavioral science texts and commonly there is barely a mention. This is truly sad but it is absolutely scandalous that the same is true of most philosophy texts.

B000059PPN|5.0|MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br /><br />The titular abode is a creepy old mansion with a neighboring graveyard in which resides a researcher who's undertaking a professional  investigation concerning a certain Dr. William Freudstien, an 18th century physician who was &#34;banned from the medical profession&#34; on account of strange and unorthodox experiments he'd conducted, his lovely wife who isn't thrilled with the house and it's macabre surroundings, his young son named Bob, a creepy little boy ( who, I'll note, happens to resemble a mini version of the actor Klaus Kinski ) with a little monkey doll named Yogi for a companion and a remote control toy car, and Bob's sitter Ann.<br />A procession of weird, inexplicable and ultimately horrible occurrences unfold since they settle in. A large tomb built into the floor of the kitchen ( of all places !! ) is discovered!!  The father is attacked by a vicious bat from the newly opened basement!! Bob acquires a mysterious little girl named May for a playmate who repeatedly and ominously warns him &#34;DON'T GO INSIDE!!!!&#34;!! The inexplicable sounds of a child weeping are occasionally heard!! A terrifying audio cassette made by one of the former residents ( who, it happens, had either been gruesomely murdered or went mad )is found!!  And, last but not least, there is, it seems, a secret fourth inhabitant who lives in the basement and gruesomely murders those who stumble into it's sphere!!  This basement dwelling assailant is ultimately revealed to be a grotesque creature of ambiguous origin with a tall lanky lumbering figure and what resembles the head of a somewhat decomposed space alien which bleeds maggots!!<br /><br />As filmmaker Lucio Fulci's films from his infamous and now historical horror/gore era go, this House by the Cemetery is what I consider to be the best of the bunch artistically. It features good cinematography, eerie atmosphere and setting, an excellent musical score, good acting ( for the most part ), and has both suspense and shocks.<br /><br />HBTC features some of Fulci's best work as a director. His talent and brilliance is particularly displayed in this film. The best scene, in my opinion, has Bob locked in the basement and hysterically pounding on the door shouting &#34;Momy!!!!!! Get me out of here!!!!!!!!&#34; while the monster is slowly ascending the stairs ( his foot steps and creepy moans being audible ) and his mom and dad, on the other side of the door, are urgently attempting to open it. Finding the lock to be jammed, the father resolves to chop the door down with an axe, and tells Bob to back away from the door. Just as Bob replies that he's at a safe distance and that dad can go ahead and start chopping it, the monster, having reached him, suddenly grabs Bob's head, shoves it against the door and keeps it pressed against it while dad chops though it ( !!! ). It then looks as though Bob gets chopped by the axe ( he screams, tumbles down the stairs, there's blood on the axe blade and on the floor ), . .. but then, a moment later, it is revealed that it is the monster who has been mutilated ( his arm having been chopped off ).<br /><br />The murders are very graphically depicted, as one would expect from a Fulci film, and are also very well done at that. It's also interesting to note how the explicit violence in this film actually resembles the sex in a pornogr@phic film, with stabbing & slashing resembling penetr@t!on and spurting blood resembling ej@cul@t!on, not to mention the violent shrieking, grimacing, squirming, thr@shing, bellowing, and writhing of the victims almost resembling sensu@l ecst@sy and abandonment( though it's supposed to be terror and agony ). This is something that has always struck me and intrigued me about this film, and I've often wondered whether it was something coincidental or an express statement on the old goremeisters part?<br /><br />There's also a very creepy and horrifying visual tour of the cursed cellar ( from the perspective of a character in the movie ) along which the numerous gruesome aftermaths of previous murders are gradually found ( &#34;DEAR GOD!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT THE CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#34; utters the explorer who's undertaking this excursion at one point ). It also features that very unique Fulci visual look and flair and, of course, some good classic gross outs ( the bleeding maggots in this one being particularly good ).<br /><br />However, this movie is also, at times, CONFUSING as h#ll!!  For one thing, there are certain obscure things in the film which are never clarified yet seem to suggest that there is another party, besides the murdering monster, that is involved in the weird evil doings. For instance, during one murder scene the silhouette of an unidentified individual from outside is visible in a window which obviously isn't the monstrous killer as he emerges from the cellar. There are also these strange sinister shining eyes which appear twice and, again, clearly don't resemble those belonging to the monster that we see ( could they belong to the Devil perhaps ? ). There were also moments when it seemed to hint that Ann, the pretty but aloof and mysterious babysitter, was in kahoots with the murderous fiend, a hunch gauged from scenes of her removing a pad lock from the cellar door, without any established motive ( but, in effect, unleashing the monster and enabling the killings ) and scrubbing up the floor where a victim was previously killed. Then, however, she too got bumped off by it her self!<br /><br />Adding to the overall sense of enigma are a scene of blood miraculously flowing from out of the tomb and a basement door which apparently closes shut and locks by it's self. Could it be by telekinesis? .. an invisible supernatural force? . . or perhaps some unperceived mechanical contrivance secretly installed to it?<br /> What is the source of the weeping childish voice which apparently serves to lure victims down into the basement? .. .  Is the monster somehow impersonating it ( which would actually be kind of funny ! ) or is the other more elusive entity behind the strange shining eyes doing it?<br />Just WHAT, for that matter, IS the hideous creature that lurks in the cellar and emerges to claim his victims in such gruesome and horrendous fashion? . .. Is it this Freudstein character repeatedly mentioned? .. . perhaps something he created somehow ( possibly even transformed into )? . .. or is he the spawn of a coupling between an extraterrestrial zombie and Boris Karlof's Frankenstien monster ( now simply going on his mere visual appearance, THAT would be MY personal uninformed speculation )? What is it's motive for the killings? Apart from one brief line of dialogue in which it's stated that he &#34;needs human victims to renew his cells&#34; there's no real explanation of that either. Perhaps he's in service to the thing with the shining eyes ( a kind of assassin creature )?<br />What of the little girl May, not to mention the equally mysterious old woman who sometimes accompanies her? It sometimes seems to be implied that they're ghosts ( by the fact that nobody but Bob can perceive them, and by the old womans victorian style of dress and appearance of her likeness on a gravestone ), . .. then, however, it seems indicated that they're neighbors ( &#34;What are you doing by the window?&#34; &#34;Watching the house&#34; &#34;You can't see it from there&#34; ).<br />Of course, this is part of what I like about this movie, .. . it kind of invites you to use your own imagination and draw your own conclusions a bit like one would with a subjective painting.<br /><br />To wrap it up, if your the type of viewer who wants every little tidbit explained to them, demands total narrative consistency in other words, then, for God's sake, &#34;DON'T GO INSIDE!!!!!&#34; However, if you want some raw gruesomeness, eerieness and aren't afraid of applying some personal conjecture, well then, by golly, COME ON IN!!! .. and makeyour self right at home!

1455121924|5.0|Excellent book as to WHY WE SHOULD ELIMINATE WHEAT FROM OUR DIETS, pronto mundo!<br />Clearly explains why, contrary to what we have been told, that wheat is not something that most of us digest easily, and that it may be the major culprit for many symptoms we have related to other things, and that gluten free is not some type of trend just to be different, as the cardiologist who wrote this book can attest to by his own personal experience and his patients.  Many diabetics are told to eat wheat bread to their detriment by certified nutritionists, when they should be eliminating the wheat, and learn to substitute other foods that are far more healthy.  I stopped wheat as recommended by my physician's assistant due to adrenal concerns, including white potatoes, white rice, etc., and did not have too many withdrawal symptoms. I love my new diet and do not miss bread like I thought I would, and have found other healthier grains such as quinoa and buckwheat to satisfy my desire for pasta now and then.  I have read the book and listened to the CD's.  I would highly recommend this book and give elimination of wheat a try to see if this is what is causing you to not lose weight despite exercising...among other benefits.

The sound is phenomenal and the voice is crystal clear. I just cannot recommend them due to the constant disconnection and loss of sound.<br /><br />For those wondering, the receiver sits on my desk away from any other wireless devices. The receiver is on average about 3 to 5 feet from me and it constantly looses the signal so it's not like I'm two rooms away trying to use them.

193700788X|3.0|I must admit that I really liked the earlier books in this series and as time when on, I started not liking them as much. I read all of the others, so I decided to just go ahead and finish things out. I did read some reviews of this book before I read it and I inadvertently found out about a thing or two that happened at the end of the book or during the book. People seemed to be really disappointed. Therefore, I read this book purely to finish out the series and didn't go in with very high expectations.<br /><br />I have to say I liked it alright. Overall, I think Sookie remained true to herself. I do feel sad that some of the more main characters from earlier books aren't predominately featured in this book that is the final in the series. To a certain degree it almost felt like a TV series finale where they try to have as many guest stars as possible that appeared over the years. I felt that some things could have ended better and gotten a better conclusion and the beginning of certain things could have been fleshed out more, but overall, I see where the author was coming from.<br /><br />If you have read the other books in this series, I would recommend you read this one too. I will warn you though, it is possible you might be disappointed in the ending, like so many others, but then again you may not. It happens that way a lot with the ending of a series.
B0019NG73G|5.0|Bought movie so I could refresh my memory about Gettysburg since I was chaperoning my 8 & 11 yr old granddaughters while their mother attended a teacher's Civil War conference. The movie is factual and does not glorify blood and guts but honors those whose blood and guts were sacrificed for our country's survival as UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I was extremely proud of my granddaughters when they did the Jr Ranger Program with the National Park Service. They were totally prepared because of the movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book the only sad part is the beginning. The rest of the book is great waiting for a sequel
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook has become my favorite form of communication other than face to face.  I like the fact that it works cross platform between computers, tablets and phones.  It's been a fun way to connect with friends from the past and new ones from my hometown.  Now, if I could meet that special someone..<br /><br />My only two suggestions to seriously improve Facebook is to work on the issues of the program suddenly shutting down the app and improving searching ability on iPads, etc.  Sometimes I would like to find a post I've seen previously.  I know what group I saw it in and sometimes I know about when I saw it.  The challenge is wouldn't it be nice to be able to search by poster's name, by topics in the post and/or by date?  I've been told you can do some of this by desktop or laptop, but really, do we go to bed with our laptops or carry them around all day?
B0061S0A64|5.0|Wow. Simply amazing. I have never thought of myself as a musician, even after my parents sent me to accordian school for a year. Yah, I know, right? Anyways this is the first time I haver made my own music and actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />To get you started... nodes make music. Nodes with a + on it will send an electric pulse to a connected node. Double click to turn it off. Move closer to get fater beats, farther away to mske it slow down. Press and hold on the background to make different tones, dragging to change the tone.<br /><br />This is a must have app for anyone who has no musical talent. And a must have for those who do as well.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I use it for my iPod 6 when I workout.  The bluetooth headset I use has no problems with my iPhone but it has a difficult time streaming fully from this device.  A few things to note:<br /><br />1) Range - I don't care what the packaging tells you, it's about 6 feet in line of sight but not even 2 if there is anything in the way.  I wear my iPod on my waste band and if my shirt is over it and I turn my head, the signal drops out.<br />2) Power - Even if I turn off my iPod, this thing still draws power and drains the battery in a day.  I strongly recommend taking it out when you are done using it.<br />3) Pairing - Do not be near another bluetooth device when attempting to pair or else it will take minutes to connect.<br /><br />If you want to keep your iPod and hate cords like I do, then spending $50 on this device may be worth it.  Otherwise, consider getting a device that is already bluetooth capable.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Only 1/2 way through this season and it's really getting good.  I used to like the character Clay, but not so much anymore.  Can't wait to see where the characters go!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|in like it alot good game wish I can earn coins faster but I love it 100% hope you get new upgrade
B009UX2YAC|5.0|After playing this once or twice you are determined to unlock the characters and special features. It's similarity to Temple Run helps the game become more popular. It's a lot more childish compared to Temple Run however that's why I like the game. I would recommend this to anyone. Hope this helped!
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|After missing out on the previous two Gunships, I've been anticipating for a re-release that could be reasonably obtained.  The Geonosis Padme with the ribbed shirt, curvature, and scandalous smirk made this purchase a no-brainer.<br /><br />Figures:<br />Comes with 5 minifigures, all exclusive to this set (plus the 2 destroyer droids, which have a hollow body cavity and stand funny, so I see them more as accessories).  This is the only Anakin minifigure from Episode II - he comes with a Padwan braid on the torso.  Obi Wan has a new shaggy orange hairpiece.  This is also the only EPII version of Padme.<br />The Clone Captain is most likely the highlight of the set.  Being red instead of blue, it has the same print and mold as the Legoland exclusive.  The Clone Pilot has a regular torso but a unique helmet with a smaller visor.<br /><br />Build:<br />At 1175 pieces, the $0.10 price to brick ratio is generous for a licensed set.<br />The Gunship is true to the source material but has some few drawbacks.<br />1) The main cockpit is a separate piece and is attached to the chassis through only 1 pivot brick at the rear.  The front (with the gray rectangular latch) is actually not locked to the nose of the ship, making the cockpit very insecure.<br />2) The sliding doors on the side do not close all the way.  The box photo represents the \\"final\\" look, which is a bit disappointing since the last two Gunships could be completely closed.<br />3) The gunner cockpits on the wings are incomplete and should be a full sphere instead of half.<br />4) Like the Malevolence 9515, the ship comes with a handlebar on the top.  Lifting the ship from the bottom will crush the plates (I tried), so I guess the handle is the compromise.<br /><br />Other than these minor caveats, this is an excellent set for the price and will please young and old alike!  If you are on the fence, this is a much better value than the Sail Barge.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Right off the bat Green proves to you this isn't your typical star crossed love story. This is a thought provoking refreshing novel that keeps you turning the pages even after the book is finished. The style of writing is phenomenal. I highly recommend it.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Good movie! I am a girly girl and this movie almost had me in tears a few times but as a parent I can relate to this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa wwwwwww ssssssss oooo mmmmmmm eeeeee I JUST LOVE THE GAME IT IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think its really cool and fun.  It has a lot of different things to do and buy so your never bored.ithink its really worth getting and if it cost like $2.94 I would still get it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is super exciting ..never a boring moment I love the missions and the daily challenge keeps making you come for more..and monthly there's a new city.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great game. Fun tower defense levels with a side of rpg and hero characters ala Warcraft. Hard to find much better for the Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome u can ulgrade it and weverything like paris and bahamas and even china its awesome! u should so get it is great! and if u want u can go to settings on ur device and do the app upgrader immediately when the upgrade comes out. i think its at least 4 stars (glitches at some times but i can get over that)
B002EDH0FE|3.0|In the wake of the Avengers, I'd never seen this before and decided to give it a look-see.  A bit cheesy but tries to stay true to 50's technology, the origin period or height of these characters popularity. Interesting story line with multiple heros but I felt like Rausach, the guy on the cover, carried my interest to keep watching. Pity he,...ooops,....almost ruined it for ya....
B007RTAR64|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter. She is a big Hunger Games Fan. She is collecting these dolls for now
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Solid cover, is tough and functional and the screen cover is easy to apply. I would buy it again. Good value too.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The best book ever I love it can't wait to read the next one I think Percy is in  hope he is can't wait to read
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|The acting saves this interesting concept of someones theory of life.  It is refeshingly different or a change of pace which kept me interested but it was noy a masterpiece of epic story telling. Hanks and Berry kept it interesting enough to finish.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I have gotten to level 24 in the first two days I've had it and it is fun.  Definitely a keeper!!
B000JCSPG0|5.0|One of my mothers favorite movies.  I had to add it to her collection.  It was a great birthday present.
034580404X|4.0|Not as erotic as I expected it to be, but story was good.  I finished all 3 books in 10 days because I couldn't put it down XD
B001LM1456|4.0|I really like the respect to the Bixby/Ferregno Hulk with the cameos they included. Technology of today allowed for better special effects but the story line stayed true to form and the actors and script were well done in my opinion.  Pity they didn't get Norton to carry over to the Avengers like they did with Iron Man, Thor and CPT America.  After watching each of the Avenger individual movieswith their background, the Avengers movie is even better.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I can't say that I'm a huge fan of Tom Cruise in any regard but this movie is fundamentally pretty good. I think it's easily worth 4 possibly 5 stars depending really on how strict you are with the ratings. For pure entertainment purposes, this is a winner.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|One of my ultimate favorite movies.  I just had to add it to my collection.It was an early Christmas present to me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most Amazing game I have played in a very long time so I think it Is a great game
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was a great book! Hilarious, sad, and compelling. John Grisham is an excellent writer. I can't wait to see the movie.
B001JIDE3M|3.0|Another family movie you can sit with the kids and enjoy pop corn, This movie is a &#34;re-make&#34; of the original and based on Jules Vern book. The special effects fall a little short and the story line seems to be almost one note.
B000HA4WT8|5.0|One of my ultimate favorite movies.  I just had to add it to my collection.It was an early Christmas present to me.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|when i first bought it i loved it. but after about a month it refused to work. it would go to the loading screen and after some time, it eould just exit the game by itself. i removed it and then downloaded it again and it's worked fine since then.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Pleasantly surprised. It was not the story I had thought. I expected drug company bashing,but got a nice mystery. It is not a 5-star classic,but an entertaining 4-star.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Lethal Weapon 1, 2 ,3 & 4 are all great classic movies with 2 detectives who don't like to follow standard procedures which often land them both in hot water.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Loved this movie growing up and now I love it even more since I get to watch it with my kid.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Loved the insight of the dr explaining his flight into forever but found too much medical revelation to explain how and why. Far to difficult for the medically untrained person to follow. Will read his interpretation of heaven many times. Love the peacefulness of his experience. The fear of dying not so scary.
B005UG542S|5.0|I cried 3 times during this movie. Such a great and powerful ending to a saga that started when I was just 7 years old, and will always be a part of me
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Cute - if you like MLP you'll want to look into this. Not much different than any other city planning game.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|One of my ultimate favorite movies.  I just had to add it to my collection.It was an early Christmas present to me.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|She love it, I liked the action and we both enjoyed the way they moved accross the city, and more
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The Avengers marks the first team up movie to feature all Marvel's previous stand alone movie characters, i.e. Ironman, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk.  This time all these heroes are brought together by Nick Fury to battle Loki and his minions the Chitauri.  From the opening moments this movie keeps you entertained with an excellent cast and especially in my opinion the best Hulk/Bruce Banner to date in Mark Ruffalo.  The action keeps coming and doesn't let up until the final credits and it's all expertly woven together by Joss Whedon with his signature wit and style throughout.  To anyone whether they are a fan of this genre or not, this is an incredible movie to rent or own.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved it very dramatic every thing changed from the beginning to the very end. I'm definitely gonna read the rest of the books
B00005JM4Z|5.0|One of my ultimate favorite movies.  I just had to add it to my collection.It was an early Christmas present to me.
014241493X|3.0|Not John Green's finest book. I would read The Fault in our Stars, Looking for Alaska, or Will Grayson Will Grayson again over this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! But since the recent update it won't let me play, it just says it's downloading :( help I'm having withdrawals!
B005544V6A|5.0|Really enjoyed the series so far!  I have only been through the first few episodes but I am sure the others are great too
B009FZFONO|4.0|There is SO MUCH over the top unnecessary human drama. However, the action has been excellent and the potential for some reasonably good times for Rick and his group keeps coming and going.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It is a beautiful game.  Most of the puzzles are just challenging enough.  I've played several versions and I'll keep coming back for more.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I did not realize I liked acappella singing.  I created an Acappella station in Pandora and was disappointed because of the specific sub-genre that I received.  I created a Pitch Perfect station and that worked well.  Anyway, good voices, good song choices, good mash-ups, sung and produced well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed it and was impressed with myself for being able to accomplish as much as I did.  I have never played one of these games and didn't know what to expect.  It really made my brain work.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I am so glad I found this show but very sad that they have already taken it off the air - it's fabulous!
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This is perhaps the best live album from Darlene Zschech ever. I cannot stop listening to it. It is a must have for every true worshipper.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Crash scene one of the most captivating I've seen. Movie also addresses alcoholism and drug addiction in a realistic way. You find yourself willing the characters to make the right choices.
0790729407|4.0|It helps to have some background on the Irish history involving this main character, which we did have. It was good.
B002KGEORM|5.0|What a blast of a show.  Unreal storyline and production.  Stars have it all.  This one is being past around like one of the SOA's &#34;sweet butts!&#34;
B00571F26Y|5.0|Buy it...read it...feel much better!  We lost weight and inches immediately. I truly think this is the answer to America's obesity epidemic.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I found this game very frustrating at first but, hang in there because it is worth it once you finally figure the game out.<br />Be prepared thouvh because it is addictive.
B00B3YDOGO|4.0|I ordered these books due to the high recommendation I got from two friends.  I was able to order these paperbacks for less than buying it as e-books.  I haven't had them long enough to have read them all and they are very different than the romance novels I normally read but they are captivating.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This a great game for all ages.  Great graphics and storyline. Can't wait to try a new gameYahoo<br />I recommend it
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I know little of soviet Russia during this time period covered in this novel, or of the serial killer upon which it is loosely based, so I can't comment on its historical accuracy.  However, as a suspense novel I enjoyed it, it never dragged, and enough time was spent on the characters to develop them so that I cared about them (or despised them) as a reader, but the plot was kept moving, and the story wrapped up sufficiently, and mostly satisfactorily, by the end.  A couple events were a little too spectacular to be believable, but were easily overlooked, as overall it was a great read. The author describes a dark, paranoid-ridden world, and you'll be turning the pages with a sense of dread. Heck, this would make a great movie.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|This movie falls flat in so many areas.  Except a few action sequences.  First of all, the story is boring.  Nothing new.  No twists.  No tension.  No thrills.<br /><br />The acting is decent.  In fact, a budding buddy dynamic of Tatum and the Rock was mildly entertaining.  If they had been partners in a totally different flick, they might have made a cool comedic action film.  But this is supposedly G.I. Joe.<br /><br />Lady Jaye is just there.  Why should we care?  we have no idea.  Flint is there.  Who is he?  Why is he a rulebreaker?  We don't know.  Roadblock is the closest in likeness to the character in comics.  Stormshadow and Snake Eyes and Jynx are cool ninjas, but why we should care about them is not touched upon.  NONE of the cool characters from the comics make appearances.  There is a horrible black rapper who plays a blind ninja master in Asia, yet he speaks like he just stumbled off the bus from Compton.  The movie kills off a bunch of anonymous Joes.  Who cares?  It is supposed to be an emotional inciting incident.  Nope, it's not.<br /><br />The great Bruce Willis plays an old Joe with an arsenal in his house.  Pretty stupid.  No reason to care.  No explanation for why he has an ammo dump in his house.  No explanation for why he is so special.  In fact, he is basically another anonymous Joe running around.  The flick features Cobra Commander walking around, doing nothing.  Zartan never uses his powers other than to stay as the old tottering President.  None of the characters are developed or special.  Roadblock has kids and loves them.  Whoop dee doo.  Duke is in command of the Joes, yet he is like 13 years old, immature, has less experience than most of the other Joes, and is a dork.  Nothing like the comics.  Even the cartoons had better character development and plotlines.<br /><br />If you would like a bland action movie with no blood even when someone is impaled, go for it.  This is NOT G.I.Joe in any other way than in name.  It does NO justice to the comics or cartoon.<br /><br />It is sad to see such potential flushed down the toilet.  If you'd ever like to appreciate G.I.Joe in a serious way, go buy all the comics from the 80's, 90's, etc.  They have actual storylines, excellent action, and character development.<br /><br />This movie is a simpleton's idea of story punctuated by some fun-to-watch, yet meaningless action scenes.<br /><br />AVOID.e to the comics or cartoon.<br /><br />It is sad to see such potential flushed down the toilet.

1416583432|4.0|Book was given as a gift and I felt it was a good overview of how dogs think and respond to humans in various situations.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I am a huge John Mayer fan, and this CD has a so much good stuff on it.  There is an acoustic segment, a John Mayer Trio segment and then a typical segment.  I love the way John Mayer plays live though - the songs are never done the same way twice.  And, this has so many of my favorites on it.  Very nice.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved the way this story was told. The characters were interesting and believable. Wonderful read that I  would certainly recommend to friends.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|The style is simple and the author does a good job of explaining all these studies and theories without boring us. I found the ideas expressed in this book genuinely intriguing and interesting. They made me stop and reflect on what really motivates me and whether or not I'm doing it right.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the repetition. It is important to state the key ideas, but many of them came up just too often.
0823003035|4.0|Not a lot of anatomical information in this book, but the author has superb drawings and instruction with regard to portraying the human body.
1594487154|5.0|Great book if you believe that humans sell to humans best!  Gives you practical tips on ways you can improve your pitch etc.  Brilliant little stories along the way make it easy to read...it was so engaging it was my actual 'holiday book' well worth the cash and the time.  Buy it!
0142420891|5.0|Wonderful finish to if I stay. So sad that it had me in tears and my heart breaking for Adam and Mia. Looking forward to the movie version of If I stay.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Need we even say more?! This is Buddy at his best. Like a good wine he only gets better with age! Buy it now!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|So I like the books I want to know more about Gale . I thought he was the one for her
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Absolutely loved this book. I read it in 3 hours and didn't even feel like it was almost 300 pages. Only reason gave it four stars is bc of sex scenes. I personally like clean books which are hard to find good ones but I just skipped over them. The love story is good just didn't like that only met and fell in love in three months time. Kind of unrealistic to me. Will buy her other books in this series.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Heartbreaking history. Makes me ashamed of the American government, again. Indians are the race that were truly done wrong. Disgraceful.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|A beautiful story that tells of a time.  Live how every other chapter is an image which brings the reader deeper into the story in a way that the continuation of the plot or an author's commentary couldn't have.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Made my dream machine possible on my budget. A little tough to install, but so are most processors i find.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Well thought out perfectly executed really thought of everything excellent app best keyboard available.  Gets betterwith eevery update.  Worth the money.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|The Red Shirts fight back, and protest that they are more than cannon fodder.  If you get those words, read this book, it will make you chuckle.  And then think a bit.  Then chuckle some more.
B000VSAEYI|1.0|I really can't rate this item since it's a birthday present for my 2 1/2 yr. old granddaughter in November.  She probably won't use the play center until the summer of 2014.  At that time, I will rate it.
B0014H32MG|5.0|What can you say.  The book is the book, but using Amazon to buy them is the only way.  No problem with ordering or shipping.  Arrived on time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love it. Stephen King knows how to keep you glue to the book. I could not put it down, I wanted to read it all in one day.
B0001I561E|5.0|Lots of action, adventure, and fun for the family.  Typical Disney in that many of the jokes work on two levels, one tickling the kids and the other tickling the adults.  This movie is a classic, good for the family's permanent library.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Baker Cline knocks one out of the park with this book. The parallel between the two main characters is interesting but what I really enjoyed was learning about Orphan Trains and their impact on so many lives.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|What can you say.  The book is the book, but using Amazon to buy them is the only way.  No problem with ordering or shipping.  Arrived on time.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|I enjoy listening to her debut single, \\"Ready Or Not\\" and it never gets old listening to it ever since. After listening to her album, I'm surprised I enjoy most of the tracks. Now, I'm looking forward to her concert at the end of the month. I see a potential rising star.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Even in the gangster life, their are good acts and bad acts.  Unfortunately, this film shows the world how greed possesses many gangsters, even against one another.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I'm reading every Harry Bosch novel I can get.  I am addicted to these stories.  As soon as I finish one, I start another.
B007HACDLK|5.0|have read every VF novel, usually within days after it is released.  This was another excellent one.  He will be missed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is such an enjoyable and, at the same time disturbing story. Gillian Flynn is able to go into the dark thoughts and feelings way beyond the surface chaff usually depicted by writers about a marriage. She puts a light on the dark, morbid thoughts and feelings dredged up from primitive infantile aggression that I suspect most of us have but can hardly believe and try to ignore.  And she has created a character who not only has these thoughts, put spends months planning and acting them out. And the idea that it's these lizard-brain primitive feelings that not only exist, but that become the glue that binds this couple together and defines who they are.<br /><br />As a family therapist I find this story outrageous yet believable.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Great book!!!  couldn't put it down!  Ken Follett is an excellent writer!  I am reading more of his books.  I love period pieces!
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I liked the series, but the ending is left open. They need to continue the series so we can see the ultimate fate of everyone.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|What can you say.  The book is the book, but using Amazon to buy them is the only way.  No problem with ordering or shipping.  Arrived on time.
1439190275|3.0|I liked the original better with its menus and recipes. I expected more updated info, not a rehash of old material
1582701709|4.0|At first glance I did not approve of this book because it mentioned words like magnet, universe etc. but the more I read the more I realized this book uses the same principles as those mature in their spiritual walk with Christ Jesus. You obtain power from on High and it's up to you to not only recognize you have the power but USE it. It's starts from within and you get back what you project even when you fall, it's not a failure... it's a lesson that tests your will.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|For any die-hard Hobbit fans, owning the extended edition is an absolute must. With the extended edition, fans will not only enjoy never before seen sequences, but will experience the exciting behind-the-scenes videos of how the movie and all of its components were brought to life. The special features included with the movie provide the audience with a deeper understanding of what it takes to make a movie of this scale, and will also allow audiences to explore the brilliant talent of the creative cinematic team. As a life long Tolkien fan, I highly recommend the extended edition.
1569242739|5.0|I bought this a few weeks ago, and have loved everything I've made from it!  The tips for perfect baking have been really helpful, and I love how the authors put together flavor combinations that are unique.<br /><br />Since it's summer and I haven't wanted to turn on the oven on hot days, I've also been using the  [[ASIN:B008B9VSGM BabyCakes Mini CupCake Maker]] to make the cupcakes.  It takes about 8-10 minutes to bake each batch, but they've been coming out really well!<br /><br />Just be warned . . . this book may cause you to overindulge, especially if you have a sweet tooth!  :-)
B00B4FU6KE|2.0|It took me awhile to realize that Fern happened to be non human!  I never fully understood the reason that was given to the children that Fern had to be &#34;sent away&#34;.  I really wonder why both parents would agree to raise Fern with their bio children as if she was a bio sister.
B00005JKCH|2.0|Spider-Man treads a lot of fine lines, as all superhero movies must, and it negotiates all of them reasonably well, until the big action scene at the end. When Kirsten Dunst grabs and holds on to a metal rail in freefall, I'm straight out of the movie, and wondering what the hell the director is thinking. This is a superhero-only moment, so Sam Raimi has just become a dunce.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This was a great pre-quel for a classic.  I am a huge fan of the old film and was skeptical, but Disney did a great job.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG I started this book and could not stop. I love Eva & Gideon and their story. This is a MUST read series for any romantic at heart. It is full of romance, panty wetting love parts, and excitement. VERY recommended series!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|A great movie to watch. Loved the special effects and the story line. I would reccomend it to anyone but not for little kids.
B005VPRDAY|1.0|The Lego was to small for the my daughter who is only 3years old. So I was not really happy with it
B0028R3NCU|5.0|This item was exactly what I needed - a tiny USB micro card reader that can hide unnoticeably into my wallet.<br /><br />One thing to note: I bought this from seller Adorama Camera through Amazon where it was explained shipping was free - but I DID have to pay for shipping at my post office when the item came in. Buyer be advised!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The main reason I have a high end computer and 30 Mbps internet connection is so that I can stream movies uninterrupted by the dreadful buffering symbol. Well, apart from the movie, that I would rate average at best, I could not enjoy it because six times during the show I was entertained for several seconds by the message: \\"Amazon, loading video\\". Each time I checked my download speed and it came in at 30 Mbps. This leaves Amazon as the responsible party. I am disappointed.<br /><br />Back to the movie. The acting is superb; and, not surprisingly, many of the actors are familiar from the BBC series Masterpiece theater. The story line of old musicians in a retirement home specifically for musicians gets a little old (no pun intended) after a while. There is an undercurrent of mystery between two possible old lovers but not enough interest to raise the level of the story above average.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|Entertaining and progression is not to allow our to fast. Nice decoration and funny dialogue. Good for all ages. I'm an 18 year old guy and call of duty plAyer and It entertains me. One downfall is the kungfu minigame is rigged good luck.
B000VBP38C|5.0|I have seen at least 5 different adaptations of the Pride and Prejudice story.  As an Austen fan, I am incredibly picky about adherence to the original story line.  This movie really helps to portray the dynamics between the family members and between Darcy and Jane in clear light.  I really respect the alignment with the original story and the actors are incredibly talented. Not to mention that Darcy is just really noble but sexy in this characterization. I would recommend this version above all the others.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|I had to watch this movie in stages because the suspense was killing me.  Usually I can figure out a movie as it goes along and I'm not so much on edge, but with this one....it had me on pins and needles to the very end. Matt killed it in this movie.  You go Matt.  Oh, by the way the other \\"A\\" lister actors did a mighty fine job as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have played this game everyday for the past three weeks or so. I absolutely love it. It's fun to play and it's pretty cool to compete with your friends.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It,s fun I like it but the levels don,t change you don,t see other places. The repeats it self constantly you only get new gadgets
B004DMTCNM|5.0|Con Air is one of the most enjoyable films ever made, filled with a surplus of tremendous acting talent. It is both a gritty drama with great special effects, as well as non-stop comedy that will have you shaking with laughter. This is a film that can be enjoyed by your entire family and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B0097JYVAU|4.0|I enjoyed the book. The author uses a lot of different cases to illustrate how predictions should be made and the limitations of our biases. Recommended read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's addicting when you're trying to beat your friends. I also like to do the weekly hunts, missions, and daily objectives. Overall, it's a great game; the graphics, the sound quality, and just the fun is really cool.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is awesome! It's a great way to waste time. The graphics are great and the story is fine, but getting gems could be a little faster. Over all this is a great app!
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|This is a great movie. When I first watched this I was a child and I did not know it was based off a true story. I forgot about this movie and then one day I stumbled across it again. I fell in love with it again. The plot, characters and actors are all great!!!
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Some parts can seem technical but they are necessary to enjoy the author's arguments. Its amazing how far we have come.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very good book. I'm looking forward to the movie. Ender was a very compelling character. I know some people were critical that he appeared to be a very advanced 6 yr old. But I think that was author's point and intent.
B00190N4E4|5.0|Ben Kingsly is outstanding and deserved the academy award he received for his performance. Watching this through my IPad the sound was often not loud enough but using closed captioning helped a lot.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I watched this movie because it looked really good and because it has Charlize Theron in it. She is great in this movie. The cast is great, I think Kristen Stewart is ok in this, not great but she is not horrible either. She does not take away from this movie, she does have some good scenes.<br /><br />All in all I really like this movie and I would recommend this movie to people
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I have a horse and can't always be out side with her so it's fun to be in away but also have a horse to care for that looks like her
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game.  The minions are adorable and the game is fun. Love it. Download it. I can't think of anything else to say to reach the 20-world minimum.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I don't get much exposure to new music any more, but our niece played \\"Thrift Shop\\" for me and my wife.  It's a funny, quirky song, with a great video, even if I've never been much of a rap fan.  Youtube of course linked me to some of Macklemore's other stuff, including the KEXP broadcast, and Same Love (which as another reviewer pointed out, is very poignant).  At this point, I started to realize these guys are more than just a silly song.  Macklemore's lyrics are truly thoughtful, and the background provided by Ryan Lewis is more musical than many other entrants in the genre.  The whole CD is really darn good, and reminds me a bit of Everlast's 1998 \\"Whitey Ford Sings the Blues\\".
B001BPJJ82|5.0|I mainly watched this because it starred Lee Pace. I did not expect to fall in love with this movie.<br />I like the plot and the characters. This movie became one of my favorites!!<br /><br />I can not think of anything that makes me dislike this movie. I would recommend this movie to people
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Love Liam Neeson!  Wanted to see Taken II  but my husband had never seen the first film Taken. So I ordered both through<br />Amazon and my husband and I had a great movie night watching both.  We both love the films.
B00AYQNOU8|1.0|While the videos are interesting that's where this documentary/movie/travel??? ends.<br /><br />The video is entirely disjointed (likely on purpose (perhaps?)). In one scene they show absolutely boring little girls from somewhere dancing in costumes, the next scene a cloudy volcanic eruption. No reason why these are in this order or any of the videos which follow are in the order they are in, no relationship except they both are on planet earth. This goes on through the entire video.<br /><br />There is no explanation in how viewers are to interpret the video or what the intent of the video is. There is not a single word in the video - period, no identification of the location of any of the videos - Guess viewers!!! No captions concerning the videos. No explanation of the videos nor why they were chosen - This video is a whole lot of nothing.<br /><br />Finally - there is music, the kind you might hear in a funeral home, so pathetically boring they put you in a hypnotic state, over and over and over again.<br /><br />If, the producers had just a little respect for those paying to see this video 'minimally' they could put captions of the locations of the videos they don't even do that.<br /><br />If, you pay to see this you will not be getting what you are paying for (keep a pillow close by)
B00E8S2KV2|4.0|Ever since \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" ended, fans have been clamoring for \\"The Hobbit\\" to be adapted as well.<br /><br />Well, it took nine years of obstacles, but now we have \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\\" the first part of a trilogy of \\"Hobbit\\" movies. It has some few flaws (enough with the comedy!), but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.<br /><br />Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...<br /><br />At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.<br /><br />It took me two viewings of \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd. The second time, I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.<br /><br />Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of \\"The Hobbit\\" (plus chunks of \\"Unfinished Tales\\") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.<br /><br />And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.<br /><br />However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.<br /><br />But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.<br /><br />And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast.<br /><br />As for the extended special edition, this only has twelve minutes of new footage -- and since it was a long movie from a duology-turned-trilogy, that isn't surprising. But it will have the vast wealth of extras that we've come to expect from Peter Jackson: \\"The Appendices,\\" a massive documentary that explores the entire filming of the movie. NINE HOURS OF EXTRAS, including audio commentary from Jackson and Phillipa Boyens.<br /><br />The comedy can be a bit grating, but \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.trilogy, that isn't surprising.

B009VA1FN6|3.0|Considering that The Forgotten Garden is one of my favourite books, I was disappointed with this one.  The ending was good, the best part of the book, but oddly I did not like one of the characters who made me feel uncomfortable and it spoiled the book for me.  I suppose you could say that took skill from the author to produce that effect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and addicting because there is lots off cool things to do and the boss battles are so cool
B002C4YYEU|4.0|I get tired of all the similar plots and the emphasis that movies put on special affects versus the actually story line. This movie is so creative. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in something that is outside of the box and very entertaining.

1400069742|5.0|The Isolationists are still with us..and at this past point in time, they truly were determined and capable of slowing our involvement in the WWII...It also captures how difficult it was for Roosevelt to move the country ,ever os slowly to the rescue of Great britain, which was the last bastion of any form of freedom in Europe...It remains puzzling,but so evident today, still how allegedly intelligent or respected individuals leaders can exhibit such selfish self interest and disregard..but then it provides us, the book, a strange counterpoint to what the country has been doing in all its subsequent wars, with using intervention for questionable purposes..It clearly creates an appreciation and degree of understanding of the men who tried to prevent what had to be done and introduces one to many whom we dont know usually ,who assisted in accomplishing something so essential for democracy to continue.

Mixed emotions as it gets closer to the end...can't wait to see how it ends, but sorry that it will.<br /><br />11/27/13<br />The above was written while I was still reading Dance With Dragons.  While my opinion of this book (still great) has not changed, imagine my surprise (not a happy one) when I reached the Epilogue still noodling over a number of loose ends.  Frustrated, I visited the author's website, only to find that there are two books still to be completed/released.  One can only hope that the next book will arrive before my memory or eyesight fails.

B004HWYTP4|4.0|On a whim I decided to watch this movie because I'd seen it around for awhile. It was so much better than what I thought now I can't wait to see Red 2.
B00C2IPB66|5.0|Loved it before but now seeing the extended parts truly is great. It's bloodier, it's even more complete and now you can even get more out of the characters roles which enhances the movie as a whole and I just think it is great. The other title sequence also is just fantastic, brilliant, the people who did the original did a wicked job, i wish it was in the released theatre version but I understand time restraints with the lame American kids and their parents that pretty much ruin everything, but now at least we get to see that it existed at all. Thanks for releasing this Mr Scott. It's an amazing film that gets better every time I watch it.

B0090SI582|3.0|The X-Men movies have been a roller coaster for fans of the source material.  2000's X-Men was a delight to see on the big screen, seeing our favorite band of heroes actually come together on screen for the first time.  X-Men 2 topped that, becoming one of the finest comic related movies still to this day.  Unfortunately, that's when X-Men: Last Stand came out.<br /><br />Helmed by a new director (Brett Ratner, infamous in Hollywood for his mediocrity), Last Stand basically flushed the X-Men legacy down the toilet.  Armed with memes and the audacity to murder off prominent members of the X-Men lineup, the X-Men movies came to a halt.<br /><br />In '09, Wolverine had his first solo outing, X-Men Origins: Wolverine.  It was, in a word, terrible.<br /><br />After seeing those two duds, I was not excited for X-Men: First Class, but went to see it anyway.  It was surprisingly good, and brought life back to the X-crew.  Finally, the series had a pulse.  Now, in 2013, in anticipation of X-Men: Days of Future Past, comes The Wolverine.<br /><br />First, the cast.  Hugh Jackman has never looked better as Logan.  He worked hard to get in shape for this role (even employing help from The Rock), and it really showed.  The rest of the supporting cast is sufficient, but does not stand out.<br /><br />The direction was sufficient by James Mangold.  I can only dream about what may have been with Darren Arronofsky at the helm.  He had worked on the film and script for 6 months, but wanted a much darker, rated R film, which the studio did not want.  Shame.  Could have been amazing, and much closer to the comics.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this movie, but I liked it to the point that I probably wouldn't watch it again.  There was one scene that really stood out as being amazing - a fight along a bullet train that happens near the beginning of the story.  It was simply breathtaking, and one of those scenes that will stand out for years to come.  It's a shame it wasn't topped later on in the movie.<br /><br />I think that the problem with The Wolverine is that there was no great villain.  The villains in the film, including one female mutant, are very one-dimensional and very, very uninteresting.  From the trailers, you can see that we get the Silver Samurai, although he's nothing like he is in the comics.  I hope that the next Wolverine outing comes with a dose of Omega Red, as I think a one on one Omega/Wolverine movie would be outstanding.  If you look at the great comic book movies, they all have iconic, menacing, charismatic villains.  The Dark Knight had Joker, the king of villains.  Spider-Man 2 had Doc Oc.  The Dark Knight Rises had Bane.  This movie...had a few unmemorable villains.  Shame, really.<br /><br />There were a few good scenes here and Jackman did a great job as Logan/Wolverine, but as an overall product, I didn't think it was great.  It was better than Origins, however.<br /><br />PS: Be sure to stay after the credits, as (if you watched and remember the abomination known as X-Men: The Last Stand), there's quite a shocker that leads us into 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past.<br /><br />Final Score: 3/5in the movie.<br /><br />I think that the problem with The Wolverine is that there was no great villain.

B00E3UN44W|3.0|ETA: January 17, 2014<br /><br />It would not be an exaggeration to say my first viewing of 'A Study In Pink' was a Holmesian experience like no other - I actually remember thinking this must have been how fresh and innovative and clever SCAN was to the Victorians. To this day, I regard that first episode as one of the greatest Sherlock Holmes adaptations, though while it's only fair to review this series based on its own merits, let me first begin by saying that while I have always enjoyed the plot deviations, Sherlock has strayed so far from its roots, I no longer regard it as something even loosely based on Doyle's characters.<br /><br />Despite complaints from certain quarters, I enjoyed The Empty Hearse immensely, even overlooking my hesitations regarding John's less than ebullient reaction to his friend's return, whose literal and metaphorical blow was softened nicely with humor. All the tension that had been building from the last series' cliffhanger was alleviated cleverly with the tongue-in-cheek way in which it was approached. I give Mr Gatiss a good deal of credit for what he created out of the corner he could have very well been painted into had the resolution taken itself too seriously. Much as I loved 'Sherlock', I found the complaints this episode was terribly out of character to be baseless - it did, of course, have moments of such, but then again, this has been a running theme throughout the series, and I have always in the past forgiven such instances when the episode itself was solid.<br /><br />The Sign Of Three was phenomenal. It was not conventionally plotted, but did have several plot threads, one of which becomes the main puzzle for Sherlock to solve during the wedding. In all honesty, I actually felt that the fan service was slacking and the program was getting back to its roots as a crime drama, albeit a more lighthearted one. The glimpses we get of Sherlock and John in their \\"off hours\\" was lovely, and Mary was scripted so well this was the first time in the umpteen adaptations I have read/watched that I really felt we were being given those scraps of what Watson tells us about her in Canon. Bits of OOC behaviors ran through the episode, though this came to a head during parts of the wedding reception's end - my honest assessment being this was Benedict Cumberbatch at a wedding, not any incarnation of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />This was a very disappointing turn of events, but while I was beginning to regard series 3 as more of an AU adaptation where suspension of belief is required, the second episode still managed to become one of my favorites.<br /><br />What happened with His Last Vow, where precisely it went so irredeemably wrong, I am not certain, but veer off course it did, and it was somewhere towards the middle of this episode that it occurred to me I no longer had any emotional investment in this program anymore, because to do so would have made me utterly disgusted. I had severe problems with parts of A Scandal In Belgravia, as I felt Irene Adler was not done justice to, nor could I reconcile some of Sherlock's behavior and that love interest claptrap. Even so, the supporting characters were strong, especially Martin Freeman's John, who has been like a lighthouse in a storm throughout instances of weak scripting.<br /><br />If you have any great wish to despise this world and the wonderful characters that once inhabited it, then by all means, watch His Last Vow. Even if one comes into this series with no background knowledge of the books, there are deep-seated issues that simply cannot be ignored. There was so much wrong here, I cannot even find a suitable place to begin. There was promise in the first 20-30 minutes, but had Moffat been writing fan fiction he would have been \\"flamed\\" for character bashing of the worst kind. It was made astoundingly clear that he has no qualms whatsoever with turning the characterizations of all major and several minor players on their head, for what reason I am unable to discern. For that matter, he seems to be perfectly fine with making Holmes mentally deficient, as any acumen possessed by the detective or cerebral merit of the program was entirely lost. Plainly spoken, Moffat's Holmes was painfully stupid.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, Moffat has absolutely no concept of what characterization is, much less how it naturally evolves in one's writing, and all the nonsense from ASiB and this last episode was made perfectly clear when he makes several blatant references plucked straight from the pages of Baring-Gould. He presents himself as being some sort of Holmesian expert, but if any of his fodder is coming from that particular avenue, it explains his shoddy take on Sherlock Holmes and his inability to write the man to save his life.<br /><br />But that's not to say he only managed to run Holmes through the mud, here. No, he had to drag Mary (in the most abominable of ways - I don't care how the issue was resolved!!!), Molly, even to a small extent Mrs Hudson and John through the mud. This craving for danger he's given John Watson is deplorable. In Canon, his sole interest in Holmes was bourne of a scientific curiosity (\\"the greatest study of mankind is man\\"), which grew into a mutual love and respect on both their parts. Here, John is just a cheap thrill seeker who is pretty much a psychopath himself and seeks out his like - i.e. Sherlock & Mary.<br /><br />So. I do honestly believe the first two episodes, even with their faults, were deserving of high marks, hence my three star rating, which I think is being generous. Taken for what it is, this was great entertainment of a far superior quality to 99.9% of shows on television. I was willing to continue watching even with the deviations, to simply enjoy it as a crime drama if nothing else. Unfortunately, I do not foresee any improvements whatsoever with Moffat at the helm, and unless he is thrown overboard in the capacity of a writer, I will not be watching series four. I simply do not care what happens anymore, a sad thing to admit of a program that was once one of the best and wisest I had ever known.n I am unable to discern. For that matter, he seems to be perfectly fine with making Holmes mentally deficient, as any acumen possessed by the detective or cerebral merit of the program was entirely lost. Plainly spoken, Moffat's Holmes was painfully stupid.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, Moffat has absolutely no concept of what characterization is, much less how it naturally evolves in one's writing, and all the nonsense from ASiB and this last episode was made perfectly clear when he makes several blatant references plucked straight from the pages of Baring-Gould. He presents himself as being some sort of Holmesian expert, but if any of his fodder is coming from that particular avenue, it explains his shoddy take on Sherlock Holmes and his inability to write the man to save his life.<br /><br />But that's not to say he only managed to run Holmes through the mud, here. No, he had to drag Mary (in the most abominable of ways - I don't care how the issue was resolved!!!), Molly, even to a small extent Mrs Hudson and John through the mud. This craving for danger he's given John Watson is deplorable. In Canon, his sole interest in Holmes was bourne of a scientific curiosity (\\"the greatest study of mankind is man\\"), which grew into a mutual love and respect on both their parts. Here, John is just a cheap thrill seeker who is pretty much a psychopath himself and seeks out his like - i.e. Sherlock & Mary.<br /><br />So. I do honestly believe the first two episodes, even with their faults, were deserving of high marks, hence my three star rating, which I think is being generous. Taken for what it is, this was great entertainment of a far superior quality to 99.9% of shows on television. I was willing to continue watching even with the deviations, to simply enjoy it as a crime drama if nothing else. Unfortunately, I do not foresee any improvements whatsoever with Moffat at the helm, and unless he is thrown overboard in the capacity of a writer, I will not be watching seriesfour. I simply do not care what happens anymore, a sad thing to admit of a program that was once one of the best and wisest I had ever known.
B000HWZ5XI|5.0|I enjoyed his 80's, 90's and 00's this one is a good one to get if you like his blues stuff.
B008602KQI|4.0|Pretty good script with some minor exceptions.  Starts slow but builds nicely to a good finish.  Good action movie.  Looks like they left the door open for HG2.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Can't wait to start reading the next in the trilogy! You don't have to be a witch to appreciate the historical and magical references in the storyline. You won't be able to put it down!
030758836X|2.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers who said they felt that the ending of this story was disappointing at best.  The concept of the story was great.  It's a shame the author did not develop the plot differently.
B000068FWC|5.0|I enjoy there crime of the century and this one is a great one to get if you like there 1979 album.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Refreshing to hear great metal material! Love it got everything you need in music. It will have me jamming every day
B0091REZMW|2.0|the app kept freezing, it took forever to advance, and I got bored. I deleted it, I didn't want to use me memory for this.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|I was in Krakow this summer and visited the hideous death camps as well as Schindler's factory.  The movie is Spielberg genious and Liam Neeson at his finest.  Terrific, but very troubling story.
014312093X|2.0|I chose this novel  for my Book Club and have to admit very few of us had the stamina to finish the book.  I even ordered the BBC recording to help gain a better understanding,  and that had so many flashbacks,  different from the book,  that I was confused and befuddled. The reviews I read gave the impression that this was the supreme spy thriller,  but it would not get my vote.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This was a good game you could play on your down time. It saves where  are so you can resume whenever. :) This was fun to play. I downloaded it while staying overnight at the hospital and time flew by.
B00AYR2FPM|5.0|I love this album, this review is not about the music.  Enough has been said there.  For those thinking about purchasing it on vinyl, get the CD.  I bought two separate copies of the record on vinyl, and was disappointed each time.  Distorted in spots, harsh, etc...  Just don't think it is worth the extra money.<br /><br />I gave the album 5 stars because I do love the music.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing read! This book made me look and see things differently. I recommend it if you're looking for a good read.
B00AK77WPE|5.0|This is the best concert ever ! .. the best song for me is the one with Romeo Santos, and what a great surprise with the appearance of Juanes. Highly recommended.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I would like to say that it is a lot easier to play this game on a tablet. I have it for my iPhone and it is pretty hard to play. Other than that, Heroes Of Order And Chaos is a really good game, although it would be cool if there was a campaign. Oh well, just my opinion.  :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was full of surprises and sadness. I found it hard to watch one show at a time but i didn't want the series to end.<br />The writers are brilliant and the actors and actresses just as brilliant.<br />Everyone should see it or they are truly missing out not only in a story of fiction but true history of the times.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|It took me a bit to get into the story but buy half way it was a  great page turner.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|If you like action you will love this movie, Action Packed from start to finish! Watched it with two grandsons and they loved it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I tell you what this series is one of my favorites. I couldn't stop reading it at all I stayed  up till after  3 a.m. reading it. :)
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I am a James Rollins junkie. I like all his books and this one did not disappoint! As always, his blend of fact and fiction makes for an exciting read.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good movie with good action and characters.  Nothing great, but put together a fun movie to watch for everyone 10+.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I like my men flagged.  I enjoy good story-lines and adventure, action movies.  I thought Chris Evans a talented actor.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|i have this in  DVD  i am watching  it now<br />fast shipping good movie  i am getting day light<br />fast shipping  get some popcorn  and hope you have a pause butten<br />you don't want to miss any thing  thank you  amazon
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I loved this book. I have experience something in my past and this book definitely helped me understand. I recommend this book to anyone that wants a change in there life.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The book was too long and the story line disjointed. Too much time was spent in describing things in such minute detail.
B00CFA222M|5.0|I like a story line that makes you think there was a hint of truth to it.  The ending was superb
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is like a brainteasser and fun at the same time!!! If you haven't downloaded this game yet, do it now!!!!
B00D2K40WY|3.0|This one of the best fashion games I have ever played my cousin and I are big girly girls and we just love this game.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I so enjoyed reading the Camel Club I couldn't put it down. If I went to sleep I would dream of how it might end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The best running game i ever play its so much fun and the kids will love it don't just let me tell u about it go and see for yourself and u wouldn't regret it download and have fun i can't put my kindle down i just want 2 play and play till the battery life is dead lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm sick in bed and I got this game thinking it would not b very cool. I was wrong and it was very cool.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've been a fan of Spider for some time. But not all are equal with options & resolution. This particular Spider measures up to my personal specs. :-) A five star rating -- absolutely.
B002DPRLEI|5.0|These movies are great (meaning that they are better than the so called realistic movies of today).  I grew up in an era where movies were truly intertaining
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't stop watching The Walking Dead.  Can't wait for Season 4.  I like it so much I have watched each episode more than once.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game I'm always on it and it always keeps me busy. It's fun and i like the graphics
B00009R6H2|5.0|Excellent product just as I expected. Good idea having two photos of the product, helped confirm the item was actually the one I wanted since I wasn't positive on the product number.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the infinite possibilities that could be there for this game.<br />I like the infinite possibilities that could be there for this game.<br />I like the infinite possibilities that could be there for this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My grandson put this on his Kindle Fire and I ended up playing it more than he did.  Good for the brain.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game for all ages. I love playing it and my 6 year daughter loves it too and she does better then me.
B00821OX98|3.0|It certainly a watchable series and I'm rooting for it to be better. It's a little corny and I think too much effort is being made to &#34;tug at the heart strings&#34;.
0446310786|3.0|Had to get this for summer homework. It was okay just didn't think it had a great plot to it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book gives me hope that an afterlife really does exist, not so much for old people like me, but for the young people that are all too often taken from us too soon. I would recommend this book for anyone who has lost a loved one, which I guess is pretty much all of us.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|I love this game! You have to love animals to even consider this game. In this version you get hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits. The rest you have to buy. But it's still a nice game without purchasing other animals. You clean, feed, brush the animals then people come to adopt them. I personally like this game because you care for animals which I love doing. #simpleenoughforme;)
B001EIOOWC|4.0|Viggo Mortenson is a great actor and he took on a Russian-mafia role with his usual cerebral performance.  Great Film.
B004W4CK44|5.0|I like the film a lot – quite a masterpiece by Wim Wenders,  Soundtrack brings back the images and spirit of the film, but even without the film this compilation is wonderful. And two tracks Jun Miyake are mesmerizing! Enjoy!
B009GFEOY8|1.0|The whole package of film was faulty. I did not get a SINGLe picture.  It CERTAINLY WAS IMPOSSIBLE !I would like to send thweffilms to  The impossible  company but there is no complaint deptarment listed . My be some one could provide with an address ?<br /> I bought a second package locally and had a similar result. I used thre different cameras.
0425263924|4.0|I really enjoyed her first two books as well as this one but i felt like something was missing.  It was great and i thought it was leading to something but no. It was like going to a 5 star resturant and getting a vaule meal, but oh well ill still read another one if she comes out with more.
B009E3EY38|4.0|Great to see these guys get together for one last great show. Predictably the video cuts are annoyingly fast on the fast songs. Fortunately the cuts come slower on the slower songs. Plant and Page are looking very old here but they do sound great. It's just sad that these guys only get together about once every ten years. 3 or 4 more great Zeppelin albums might have happened if only Plant had been willing to occasionally put his solo career on hold. The scarcity of Page's musical output over the last 30 years has been a tragic waste of talent. So if this is the last album of Page's career it is a good way to go out.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Overall, this was a good read. The characters are likable and it's it's easy to immerse yourself into Jones' world. Especially if you're a fantasy fan. There were times where I seriously went &#34;what the frak?&#34; though.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but it sure is a page turner!  Love it!!  It is true Dan Brown style!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love the show but I like the game better!!!!!!!! Wish they would make a game for equestria girls:(  sad face
B00CTKHXFO|3.0|I got expecting each game to be on a disk but it turns out that you have to download the original metal gears which they give you the code which means you have to have internet to download it.I thought they would update the graphic a bit on metal gear solid like they did for the game cube but they didn't. it does come with a little booklet which is cool and a digital copy of the graphic novel with the actors voicing.basically it just the HD collection in a new box
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Way too much fun!! cute game for all ages!! You will love playing this game!! I can not stop playing it!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was mildly disappointed with Hosseini's latest novel.  I realize I had very high expectations for the novel as I absolutely loved his two previous works, but this last novel let me down.  I liked the initial storyline of Pari and her brother and the mystery surrounding her disappearance.  However I feel that Hosseini got lost in this primary story.  There were too many intertwining story lines which diluted the impact of Pari and her brother's story.  The redemptive quality of his previous two works, which made the horror of brutality in the stories more acceptable, had only minimal impact in this latest novel.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love this game.  Played it again just for fun.  Suggested improvements:  count the moves used so player can aim for the minimum possible; go directly to a level; more levels; create and save/share your own ball creations for others to solve.  I like the music, too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game available right now. Just like temple run but far more fun for me. Plus I'm a minion fanatic so that's a plus.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan does great research and keep the story moving without losing the reader.<br />It's hard to put this book down.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This app is sooooo much fun!!!!!! I love watching my grandchildren play it they have a blast!!!!! Lots of fun!!! Enjoy!!!!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I am very pleased that I read Gone Girl, although I must confess about a third of the way through I was seriously bored by it and thought it very predictable. I only stuck with it as it is being read by my Book Club. I'm glad I did as about half way through a really clever twist emerges and from then onwards it becomes a page turner.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I had high hopes for this DVD set when I ordered it, and have been satisfied more than I imagined possible. The audio and visual are masterful, and the camera angles are diverse, capturing the whole range of elements of this amazing performance. The veteran Pink Floyd members and associated band on stage mesh perfectly. The mix of songs on DVD one is great, from the ethereal start with Shine on You Crazy Diamond to the amazing jam with an old classic to conclude it. The full performance of Dark Side of the Moon on the second DVD is exceptional in all regards, and the encore quite memorable. What a finish with Run Like Hell! The set, lights, effects, pigs, and airplane all captivate and mesmerize. This is a DVD set that one can watch repeatedly and enjoy each time, and the extras are quite good as well. If your Pink Floyd experience has been based solely on vinyl and CDs, this DVD set will elevate it and enrich it immensely.
B006LSZECO|4.0|just tired of everyone thinking they have to be Stephen King. Great writing but walked away disappointed. Maybe I'm getting old.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great story full of connections between lives that seem real in and of themselves, and do not seem too farfetched to cross. Waiting for the next installment.
B003629IPW|5.0|What can I say? The man was a genius. This is a rare look behind the scenes into that genius mind and process. Worth owning.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|A nice mix of diverse approaches and styles, with some wonderful collaborations. Rockin' and laid back meshed together well, and a cool presentation concept.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Smiles, tears, joy, and sorrow...everything you've come to expect from Downton. If you're a fan, season 3 will not disappoint!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This ad-free app was worth the money if you love this game and can't stand all the ads popping up. It made this game way more pleasant!
1401322425|5.0|I liked many of the recipies. and I shall use them over time. It complements my many other cookbooks. We enjoyed  Jamies Italian restaurant in Edinburg in May.
B00006LI4S|5.0|The experience here is more laid back than with the DVD set Pulse. Yet it is engaging and captivating, and a bit more personal and up close. A great addition to anyone's David Gilmour collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son is addicted to this game. He plays it every day & can move around the slides very proficiently. Make his sister jealous on how fast he can do it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I love the movies to this game so I thought I'd give the game a try and it is very addictive. I can't stop playing whether I keep loosing or not. Great game.
B003PJUAB2|5.0|Must have CD for any and all music collections. Artistic lyrics accompanied by beautiful guitar leads. Love this album to death. Must buy!
B000ELJBAA|4.0|Those expecting more of the David Gilmour style in Pink Floyd ventures, Momentary Lapse of Reason or Division Bell, will not exactly experience it here. Yet, this is a fine music experience and worth having in the music library of any Gilmour fan.
1476734941|5.0|OK so over the years I have made efforts to loose 5-10 lbs every so often.  I usually did this by denying myself all the foods and drinks that I like.  Such as no beer at all. It took me months of denial to hit my weight goals.  I have been on the fast plan for 4 weeks and have lost 8 lbs and 3 1/2 &#34; off my waist.<br /><br />The first fast day ( 600 cals split in 2 meals) was hard but by fast day 2 it was no biggie. Past attempts I may have dropped a 1/2 lb in 4 weeks and been missing all my favorite foods. Now they are there for me 5 days a week.  I told a friend at work about this book and plan and he is only on week 2 and lost 13 lbs and 2 inches!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I can't get enough! I Love the twist and turn of events every! And the boys aren't bad to look at either. ;)
B008MG1E4A|3.0|An interesting first-hand account of the raid that ended with the life of Osaba Bin Ladin  by the elite group of Navy Seal. Written with a very limited vocabulary, I found it ideal for English as a foreign language students and middle-schoolers. Although I bow to the courage and sacrifices of these brave men, the tone of the author is quite shallow. According to Mark Owen (a false name), the core of the credit falls on the foot soldier, who is at the mercy of hesitant burocrats and politicians in Washington DC who just simply do not have the guts the Seal have to come with a decision and act accordingly.<br /><br />I sense that Mr Owen overlooks and disregards to some point the massive investment, logistics, training, technology development in wide variety of aspects, the finest equipment, the best intelligence they could get and the seasoned leadership that put these group of men in a position to take a shot at the FBI most wanted. It is like praising the astronaut for the moon landing and not the titanic engineering behind the feat!<br /><br />A more informed and comprehensive account of the final days of Osaba bin Laden can be read on Peter Berger's Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search of Bin Laden from 9/11 to Abbottabad. Interesting that Owen account of the final shot on Bin Laden is, according to Bergen, inconsistent with the blood trail found at the compound.
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband and I started watching this show one night when we had nothing to do. I had never heard of it before. From the first show I was addicted. That first night we watched 3 episodes, we had to make ourselves turn off the TV since we had to go work the following day and it was past 1 am. Our 10 year old son stared watching it with us after that first night. Now the family is addicted. We are on season 2 now and every night we watch 2, with my son asking for more!!!!!!
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|I know many still hope for the day when Ritchie Blackmore returns, but I am loving this band with Steve Morse in it.  The songwriting is as good as ever and Ian's voice seems to get better with age.  My only complaint may be the overuse of Don Airey's keyboards...would like to have heard some longer solos from Morse.  Still, this album shows that Deep Purple can still create great new material after all these years. So many other bands have either fallen by the wayside or are turning out second rate albums (i.e. Bon Jovi).
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is quite a good game and I enjoy playing it!I especially enjoy the updates of the world tour also!
0316223239|3.0|The reader is rarely presented this perspective.  The rituals that were established to preserve sanity and health were intriguing. Claustrophobia was kept at bay by the author,  but barely. The loss of the womb was almost devastating for mother and son.  And what if....This is a novel that lingers many days after the book has been closed.
1451695195|5.0|This was an absolutely wonderful book.  I wholeheartedly recommend it for anyone interested in Near Death Experiences, or Heaven, itself
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|I received a copy of the book from the author for an honest review.<br /><br />A hidden world unfolds as we became acquainted with Owen Sage and his two friends Dante and Anika. From the start, you are drawn into this world as it faced the forces of Evil, whose main aim is to take it over. Draining the occupance of their source of life due to betrayal and the collusion with darkness.<br />The three friends find them selves in the midst of these battles as they enter their first day on Campus. They are introduced to several clubs that will enhance and train them for the task at hand. Meeting interesting people that benefits them at the end. The training teaches them to gain self control, and to calm their thoughts in the unnatural circumstances.<br />This story is about sacrifice and team work, without the two Everville can not be saved. We learn more about their path as Owen, the leader of the small group is whisked away into this dimension and got to know The Keeper, the Fron, Them, The Other In Between, and the giants. We learn more about the Keeper and the sacrifices he had to make in order to safe his world and how his journey prepared Owen for his task at hand. The unusual names lending to the uniqueness of the story.<br />The story-telling is lengthy and told from Owen's point of view. With only a few conversations throughout the book. Well written it draws you into the many facets of the story as you learn about their courage, their willingness to help and stand together no matter the consequence.<br />A wonderful Sci-Fi Fantasy story with an unique plot and easy reading.
B007BZM30M|1.0|I am honestly sick of this song, its extremely repetitive (something I am NOT impressed by) and it is over played to death everywhere you go, thankfully neither of my jobs have this play on our store playlists
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Love every song on the album, my family and I listened two it for three weeks straight and couldn't get enough.  Since we couldn't share one CD we bought a second copy along with Amazon auto-rip and can listen to it anywhere on any device.
B001DUDKEY|3.0|its okay but i felt it lacked more depth and detailed, it does followed closely with the book and its wordiness.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I found season 3 to less gloomy . ..the story line is good, goes along at a fast pace which I like. Can't wait til 4 I's completed.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I have a rule that I must finish any book that I start, this book was agonizing to read!  I certainly did not expect Harry Potter, but I did not expect disgusting!  I generally read an eclectic variety of books, all types! I do enjoy books with in depth characterizations and certainly not fairy tale lives!  This book was misery heaped on misery a pathetic view of humanity.  Some might say that it was a 'realistic' description of life. I disagree!  So basically I hated it!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I can't believe all the time I wasted reading this book, thinking that it would actually have some redeeming story.
0805028846|5.0|Takes you through the basics to the nearly impossible. Some intricate folds and engineering that should drive me crazy for months.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Reacher novels just roll along making you want to read more. Very relaxing to read. Good kick back reading. Good twists and turns.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|A fun story for the whole family that was probably way ahead of its time when it first came out. The fairy tale is delightful as the father in the family, played so well by Van Dyke, tells his two children stories about the imaginative adventures in the magical car. The car is named Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang since its sounds seem to say that.<br /><br />This is a movie that has pure entertainment value, the chance to just take you away from your current world and transport you into a world of flying cars, singing and dancing, just for fun. Don't look for any socially redeeming value. Just sit back and enjoy the adventure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|omg so addicted it is so fun ps i would go see the movie for realzes  o m g ahhhh
0385340990|5.0|I borrowed this book from my sister, loved it so much that, when I returned her paperback, I bought the hard cover at Amazon. Want it in my library for rreading again and again, and for leaving to my kids.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|It was a really good mixture of everything. That is the type of music I enjoy listening to when I am reading a good book.
032147404X|2.0|Kelby is a great photographer, but this book is too professional for my understanding. I have found my answers by googe-ing, and taken great shots of the moon, waterfalls and foggy scenes.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|This was a book club pick, and this is not my favorite genre.  Having said that, it was fairly predictable and there was not much character building, except for Julie who wasn't introduced until well into the story.  All the other characters seemed incidental to her, especially when she made it to Silo 17.  I would have liked to know more about Solo, bu I guess that comes in another book in the series.  Jule's predicaments and &#34;escapes&#34; were a bit drawn out, especially when she went down into the cold dark water and miraculously survived.  I probably won't read the rest of the series.
B009178OQA|5.0|Great doc if you're at all interested in sushi.  Definitely not for people who don't routinely eat sushi. Loved it.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|Why on earth would they make a sequel to Piranha 3D?  This movie is boring and nowhere near as good as the original.  Piranha 3DD is a waste of an hour and twenty-two minutes.  I don't know how this sequel got the green light- but this movie shouldn't have been made. Horrible movie. Horrible acting. Piranhas invading a water park through underground piping?  You have got to be kidding me. If you want to be scared, skip this movie and watch the original Evil Dead.  That movie was scary.<br /><br />This is a watse of time and money.<br /><br />Save your money and avoid this turkey.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|Somehow.<br /><br />Somehow what is honestly the dumbest premise imaginable for a pony movie managed to still be quite an enjoyable flick. I mean, I'm pretty sure aspects of the plot were the victims of studio mandates, but the writers were clearly aware of this, and proceeded to mock and entertain despite all of it.<br /><br />Yes. It looks stupid. It looks intensely, mind-numbingly stupid. And yet somehow, by the end of it all, it's...still stupid. But that's okay and you're totally happy.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|I have this in paperback and now on my kindle. I reread this at least once a year:)I love  this reformed rake.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has changed my life. The Kindle Fire app is amazingly easy to use and works really well with the browser (silk). So glad I downloaded it!!!
B003IY48PS|5.0|I can see why this movie was X-rated.  Graphic horror violence.  Friends trapped in a cabin and a cellar with a book that never should have been opened. An audio recording that shouldn't have been played.  A forest that comes alive and takes possession of everyone in the cabin except for Bruce Campbell.  This movie is quite possibly the best horror movie of all-time. A true horror masterpiece. This is what horror movies are supposed to be.  An edge of your seat thriller.<br /><br />Plenty of gore in the movie.<br /><br />This movie is an absolute must for every horror movie fan.<br /><br />Five stars!!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Old Man's War owes a lot to Heinlein's Starship Troopers and Haldeman's Forever War, but even as it takes its cues from what came before, John Scalzi still creates a unique and personal story of one man's journey across the battlescapes of the cosmos. In this future, the elderly are downloaded into youthful versions of themselves to serve as infantry in humanity's battle for survival. It's a pretty cool and interesting universe, one that Scalzi goes on to explore in further novels. A real page-turner, you'll finish this in no time, and while the pace is exciting, the novel sometimes takes on too much of an episodic feel, and I wished that the narrative lingered a while longer in certain settings and dealing with certain issues. On the flipside, this also gives the book a cool serialized feel as well. This deserves a read by any modern science fiction fan, and you'll find some enjoyment out of it to be sure.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|only lets u play for 15 minutes so stupid<br />once the 15 minutes is over u can not get back on that same world. don't get game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This film is outstanding.  The acting by Daniel Day Lewis,  and virtually all other cast members, is unsurpassed.  A must-see historical masterpiece.
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Very interesting ideas. I wish Sam had written more on the ideas of where our thoughts and decisions come from. Good read as always but it left me hungry for more.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Martel's books draws parallels between the animal and human worlds and lets the reader know through in depth discussions on zoology that we are not so different than tigers, orangutangs, and zebras. His chapters on the religions of Hinduism, Islam and Christianity draws the connections of these religions closer together, especially when young Pi while walking with his parents meets his Hindi master, his Muslim teacher and his priest at the same time.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|this book is amazing! i could not put it down! she is just tooooooo funny. i feel like a really know her now
B008220D5K|5.0|A fun movie to watch.  Great cast, including Paul Rudd,  Leslie Mann, and Melissa McCarthy.  The trailer is absolutely hilarious.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|be prepared for startingly intense moments, watch your sound levels cause it will go from quiet to loud in a second
1623360277|5.0|if not, this book might be the impetus for your dietary delving into this branch of vegan heaven.  Dr McDougall explains his theory re diet so clearly, and the recipes will become the staples for your domestic culinary adventures.
B001V7YJMG|1.0|I am not an avid watcher of vampire movies however I love any great movie in any category at all!  I am always open!  I read a review that said this original film was so much better than the American remake called simply Let Me In because the reviewer said it was more subtle than the remake.  That actually is true to the maximum degree!  THIS MOVIE IS SO SUBTLE IT CAN PUT YOU TO SLEEP!  Only rarely do I not watch a movie to the bitter end but I had to turn this one off after the bats started flying around.  I was actually so surprised how long it took for the blonde boy to ask the vampire girl to go steady.  What happened before that is simply a blur.  I can understand how somebody else may find value in this film but to me this was a raging bore!!
B00CXQL828|5.0|... these guys get better with age.  Here we have 3 of the best at their particular craft all coming together to write and perform some kickass old-school rock music.  Kotzen on vocals and guitar, Sheehan on bass, and Portnoy on Drums.  Anybody who knows anything about Rock&Roll over the past 20-30 years will undoubtedly tell you these guys are near the top of their class.  Personally, I am a huge Dream Theater fan, and I was concerned that Portnoy's departure from DT would be a HUGE mistake on his part and a disappointment for all of his fans.  I was wrong.  If Portnoy hadn't left DT, we would not have been blessed with this musical triumph called The Winery Dogs.  I'm hard-pressed to find a song on this album that isn't great (maybe \\"Six Feet Deeper\\"?  But even that song is very good).  I hope this isn't a one-and-done \\"Supergroup\\" like so many before them.  I really hope they continue on like Chickenfoot and release more albums.  Because if this is only the appetizer, I can't wait for the main course.
0321934318|5.0|Scott Kelby continues to write fabulous guides for Photoshop software. One of the reasons I joined NAAP was because of the expert help that Scott Kelby and his staff give members on a 24/7 basis!  This newest guide to Lightroom 5 explains in detail all of the exciting new as well as polished up old information about this software.<br />I consider Lightroom 5 the best yet as far as total editing of your photographs that is available.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very realistic. I love the detail and graphics, along with the fun, constant things to do that keep you going forever!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am very pleasured with my purchase. I really enjoyed how wonderful the price was when I made my purchase. It was a great buy for my money.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|Nichoulas Hoult is a favourite of mine, ever since he lost his mind in Skins. But he couldn't really carry the cast, and man did I expect more from Malkovich. The soundtrack was more than I've heard in a while, and a good simple plot.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game but I wish it would give you more power- ups and more wins.  Also it does freeze occasionally.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so much fun.. addicting. u gotta try it.  I cant put it down. u cant beat a free app and this one is actually kore run then ones I have paid for!
B005EWDA3I|5.0|Most people in the &#34;civilized&#34; world, still don't know this author. I offered my father the full trilogy, and though at first he was sceptical about a Japanese author, the truth is that he dropped the other book he was reading until he finished them all. I myself have yet to read the final one :)
B003EV6DBW|1.0|Can't go straight to disc menu without manually fast-forwarding through many annoying previews/public service announcements.<br /><br />Won't play for more than 2 seconds on the Samsung BD-D6500, regardless of output (Component, Video Out, or HDMI), even using the most up-to-date firmware. It appears to be an issue with the 24fps. Whether the encoding by the studio or the decoding by the player, I don't know, but the extras that are 30fps work just fine. Can't comment on the shows, since I can't watch them.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoyed reading it, but I don't think it is her best.  It is still a good read and still a good book.
8437221862|5.0|The elmer book is in great condition. I also think the price was excellent. I know that my students will definitely enjoy this book!
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|It isn't a great horror movie, but it is far from bad.  The movie had a nice twist towards the end.  Though, I felt that the transition was a bit abrupt.<br /><br />There were a couple scenes where they showed some possessed or undead girl out in the woods.  I really didn't like how that was presented.  Was this the evil forest spirit?  No idea, but it seemed out of place.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a fairly typical horror movie.
B003XD7ECI|5.0|Love this album, they are so amazing, their voices, their music, it is a nice and amazing vocal combo .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was fun yet challenging. Everyone from kids to adults enjoyed the game. We found it to be just difficult enough to keep our interests yet not so hard that you would want to give up.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Enthralling book. The best I've read in a long time. The author`s  description of the village in Afghanistan made me feel as if I were actually there.<br />What a moving account of love and devotion between a big brother and his young sister.
B000005B0U|5.0|I bought this soundtrack for my husband he has the movie and loves the music from the movie so I bought it as a late anniversary gift for him
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is outstanding. The sounds are clear, and equal most white noise devices I've used.<br />Having the option to combine various sounds is the feature I love.<br />I would highly recommend this app.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|And he go it!  I love all the tracks - another good album to work out to and just generally feel good about being part of the jerkface general community.  He may not make the best decisions when it comes to public appearances (sorry, Ye, you'll never live down the Taylor Swift incident) but he is talented, passionate, and makes really good music, in my opinion, especially in this day and age when the name of the game is &#34;to have a hook&#34;.
034580404X|5.0|All three books are a must have!  You cannot just read Fifity Shades of Grey without reading the other two to see how this love affairs ends.
B00D1DBO1C|4.0|On the Kindle Fire HD, so far, so good. In testing, the first thing I check for is \\"Does monthly repetitions ask by DAY & by DATE?\\"  It does - test passed.  While this app doesn't have all the bells and whistles I've seen with other calendars, its function and ease of use far offsets any limitations. I can't customize every little characteristic and it doesn't sync with every database known to man, but it does perform as advertised, it does it well, it provides the most important features I need and it's free. Unless it blows up later, requires an engineering degree to operate or starts demanding money, this calendar seems to be the \\"pick of the litter\\". I like it.<br /><br />UPDATE: By accident I found the default Kindle calendar's somehow interacts with this one (or vice versa). Events scheduled in this one show up incorrectly in the the other. When I deleted them from the default calendar, they disappeared in this one as well. Using both calendars corrupts both schedules. The 2 can't be used in the same environment.
B002MCYWHG|5.0|My wifes favorite part of the day is taking our son for a ride.  They both love it. Great product no issues at all. BUT IT!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|This album is awesome!  If you like any Five Finger Death Punch album you will love this!  This is as good as \\"The Way Of The Fist!\\" (which was my favorite album).  Do yourself a favor and buy this album!!!  (Ignore the reviews of the haters this album is great!)
B0067R0APK|5.0|I especially like the first window.  It allows me to view the current temperature in multiple cities.  I also like the hour by hour temperature predictions.  It helps me plan my day.
B0058RCVYS|4.0|I have always liked foreign movies. The characters are well developed and the dialog is intelligent. Dialog always seems to take precedent over actions. All this is true of After the Wedding.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fun puzzle mystery. The hidden objects portion is made a little more interesting by having to do extra steps to reveal them.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|this is fun show but at the same time very engaging with smart dialogue, definitely recommend watching. hope amazon has season 3 available soon!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Easily the book that gave me the most pleasure to read his year. Now I'm just patiently waiting for the third book!
1475212607|5.0|Thank you, David, for such a clear book on the business of self-publishing as a writer!<br /><br />I'm not new to the subject. I'm about to self-publish my first book written with the intent of mostly selling as an ebook, and I've been doing my homework for several months. This is the clearest information I've found, keeping it all in perspective. Three especially helpful aspects:<br /><br />1. Always evaluating spending opportunities vs. how many books you'd have to sell to recoup that investment. And which spending he's found worthwhile, and which not.<br /><br />2. The appendix discussion on the international ebook market. (I will need to check whether some of the structural dysfunctions in Europe have been resolved yet, of course - it's been 2 years.) I'm grateful for all of the resource lists and discussions at the back of the book. But as an American, I definitely didn't understand the issues in Europe and other countries.<br /><br />3. The brief testimonials from 30+ successful ebook authors, each describing their starts in ebook publishing, and how their books took off - quickly or gradually.<br /><br />If you're looking for the place to start to learn this business - you've found it, in this book!
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I liked this game  but I already had one downloaded and just decided to get rid of this one nothing against this game and I may redownload it again .
