0061537969|4.0|Oh, I so totally loved this book, loved the dog, loved the simple writing style. Maybe not entirely believable, but certainly a heart-warming book. This was so much better than Marley and Me, which I painfully completed (3/4 only). Very much recommended for a light read.
B001992NW4|5.0|I was part of a half sold out venue in Las Vegas to watch the One Night Only Event of The Exorcist Thursday September 30th. ! In my book this is the most frightening movie I have ever seen, in a genre I love and dig deep into. When the movie was a first-run release, I was in the 10th grade and went with a mixed group of friends to see this film. I had no idea what to expect, but the effect on a good Catholic, and short time Alter Boy was overwhelming. The images and sounds, the multiple voices, and the uncredited dear Ms. McCambridge chilled me. It was the first movie I saw that had adults running for the exits, literally. A few years later I marveled at the differences and depth of the book, but was chilled again, as the images were already in my head once the Devil hit the stage!    Now fast forward to the late 70's's where I owned this on VHS, but never once watched it, to the 80's where I owned it on Laserdisc and never watched it, to the DVD era, where, guess what? That's right, I have been physically unable to watch this film a second time.     The announcement of this special event would be my catharsis, and only the second time ever that I would chance to view the film. I tried to put together a group, so that I could hide within it when the chill returned. I went with a co-worker and his 13 year old daughter. I thought that a strange invite on his part, but the girl is apparently a horror film fan, and seemingly mature enough to Dad for the undertaking. I was wondering about some of the language and certain scenes, but that would be his job to cover her eyes!     Well the chill in fact returned, and the images that haunted me were right where I left them, only this time they added some that were left out of the original. I will buy the new Blu-Ray, with absolutely no intention of viewing it, well maybe with a roomful of friends. The visceral impact was no less considering the almost 40 year gap.     The 13 year old girl? Not affected, nope, wasn't scared, what was the big deal, why all the hype she asked? Now surely most of the vulgar language is around the cable stations, pay TV and satellite radio, so I guess that is one big difference. But the images? She didn't drop her popcorn once! No point in wondering what makes this generation all that different, I wasn't much older than her when I went that first time, but it was most certainly a different era. Have we desensitized our culture so much that it takes a whole hell of a lot more to scare someone these days? Discuss amongst yourselves! War, terrorism, the breadth and speed of information traveling the internet? Who knows.    Now about the film: beautiful to look at, and I'm sure the blu-ray transfer will astound. Great detail from a 35+ year old film, however... there seemed to be little or no use of the surround channels, which have become a critical component (and expectation) from our latest movie going experiences. The pacing of the film, by todays standards, crawled. The entire sub-plot with the detective would never had made it in if the movie was being shot for the first time today. The camera held still, with long, sometimes loving shots, only cutting away quickly from what were surely 'rating' issues of the day. Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells theme is as haunting as ever, and the image of Merrin in the street light outside of the home is as classic a shot as they come.     Thank you Fathom, for a truly great event, and a chance for one person to revisit a nightmare of childhood, and remind me that...it's only a movie, it's only a movie, it's.....
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I think the people that didn't like this CD didn't understand the CD.<br />Maybe they were looking for the past while Linkin Park is creating the future.<br />You won't get a true feeling for the album by listening to a few tracks.

They are trying to tell you something.<br />I just don't think there are many people out there who will be open to the message or<br />understand what it is. If you dont \\"get\\" it, it doesn't mean the album's bad, it just means<br />you don't \\"get\\" it.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|In the course of a few short days, i have read all 3 books. To give you an idea about me: I read a lot. Love to read.  Should point out that i strongly dislike romantic type books (aka love stories - which end up being simply about descriptions of sex). A wants B who wants C so they sleep with A and D.  Normally I stick to mysteries.  I am 48 years old, currently single, lesbian, and 5 ft tall.  (in case any of that is relevant to my review).  To say that i loved this trilogy would simply be an understatement. I found it captivating. Am naming it my absolute favorite. Couldn't put it down.  Loved how it was told in the 1st person.  That bonded me more with the characters overall.  Loved that there was absolutely no ridiculously added to stimulate the audience sex.  I felt the emotions based on what I was reading. Felt it rather than had to have it spelled out to me.  There was a love story here.  But not a sex story. A pure love story.  It was awesome.  The overall story - about humanity - was enthralling. There were twists and turns and unexpected swivels. I rarely have re-read a book right after finishing it.  I am already re-reading this.  (the other series i re-read was harry potter).  I always wait until ALL the books in a series are written before starting them. And I read them one after another.  And once again - this is my favorite favorite favorite series yet.
144471032X|5.0|Best buy ever!  I am 71 and had low expectations of losing the unwanted pounds. Within 6 weeks I had lost 20 pounds and as promised in the book, the weight has stayed off. The book is concise and easy to understand with no measuring or weighing. Just plenty to eat. Have recommended it to my friends who are amazed at my new healthy shape. You are never too old to make a difference.

1881273156|5.0|For committed couples, the book is an absolute must. It's good to read it to rekindle the love and respect in each other. Plus, the love language for the couple may change over time so it's good to have in order to review every few years.
B003XQM2YU|3.0|It is an interesting take on the romantic story of Robin Hood, and from that perspective I can enjoy the variety and greater realism, but unfortunately I never felt the characters jump out of the picture and pull me in.  Russel Crowe looked stiff to me, as if he did not embrace the role with anything more than I am here.  I do demand more character development and participation from movies that I like.  I guess Russell Crowe did not seem believable, and there was no chemistry between the two main characters from my perspective.  Not a horrible movie, but I guess just ok.
0451228375|1.0|I ordered this book for my wife...she loves Follett..now I have a mad wife and a bill that I paid for which I NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT.  I cannot believe that Amazon continues to do business with the seller called superbookdeals.  I have contacted them at least 5 times and still get no satisfaction. We are considering closing our account with Amazon because of this shoddy business.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|I had not seen this film in it`s entirety before watching it on Blu-ray. I think Arnold Schwarzenegger plays his role very good. I was a bit suprised he looked so serious/angry throughout the film. I think most of the shootouts was good.<br /><br />Picture Quality: 4/5<br /><br />I think it looks pretty good. They used DNR in some scenes, but the film grain is intact in most scenes. I think most of film look sharp and detailed. Like for example in the closeups. I like that the colours looked good.<br /><br />Audio Quality: 4.5/5<br /><br />I was very suprised how good the PCM 5.1 audio track sounded. I think all those explosions sounded good with clear deep bass. All the shoouts in the present time sounded good in my opinion. The bass from the weapons was surprisingly loud and clear. I like that. When a Terminator in a flashback scene starts firing with his minigun like weapon, i think it sounded too low and lacked bass. Strange.<br /><br />Other than that particulary moment in that flashback scene, i think those flashbacks scenes sounds good.<br />When Arnold fires with the Uzi, i think it should have had more bass. Too bad. I think the dialog at times sounds unclear and too low in the Center speaker. Apart from those 3 mentioned things, i think it sounds very good. As i said earlier, the subwoofer channel is used a lot to good effect. I really liked that the rear speakers was used a lot. Like they used music, laser beams and some gunshot effects.<br /><br />Film: 4/5<br />Overall: 4/5
B002ZG981E|2.0|I'm an open-minded cinephile; but this film is a re-hash of movies and Tv shows that have already covered the same ground.  Dream-space, Existenz, Paprika, Star Trek's The Menagerie, Total Recall, Alias, Doctor Who, etc.  Right now people are on a Nolan kick so that means anything he does is automatically gold, but this film will be the reverse of Blade Runner -- it will enjoy immense popular acclaim and then be reviled fifty years from now.  I've heard all the popular defenses of this movie:  \\"You didn't get it,\\" \\"it was too complex for you,\\" for people who actually didn't like this film.  The fact is this movie aspires to be an artsy, thinking man's sci-fi film, but in the end it offers no new philosophy that better writers and directors haven't offered before.  The structure is derivative; the themes are derivative; the obligatory faux-ambiguous ending is derivative.  When you are working in the genre of sci-fi, and you are trying to craft an artsy sci-fi film, you had better be aware of all the other products out there, and offer some type of philosophy of your own, or yours won't stand the test of time.    There is nothing here that Clarke, Bradbury, Ballard, Ellison, Chris Carter, DC Fontana and many others haven't explored before.  To suggest the world is all a dream is a theme as old as time itself, and to suggest that parts of one's consciousness might be lost in separate realities or dreams within dreams is derivative as well.  Even the visual language of this film has been capitalized on in other films, everything from the moving buildings, to the presence of an infinite regression -- Nolan has managed to lift his iconography and pastiche these from other movies, without offering any conclusion of his own.  It's the difference between a teacher who can explain Kant's \\"Critique of Pure Reason\\" versus a philosopher who calls into question the validity of Kant's argument.  Nolan is so content being a teacher that he doesn't even care about whether or not heagrees with observations he is reciting.    I read one article where the film critic justified the movie as a comment on the dream nature of cinema itself (duh!) and argued that Nolan's blatant plagiarism was to be excused on the grounds that dreams themselves are the products of blatant plagiarism (or pilfering from reality).  While I admire the immense thought that went into his defense, I disagree with the idea that self-reflexivity makes or somehow elevates a film.  \\"Rear Window\\" is a masterpiece of suspense despite its allusions to the act of film-going.  It's a deeper movie when you consider how Hitchcock is implicating us in the voyeuristic process, but that alone doesn't make it a masterpiece.  Furthermore, any filmmaker who were to make a movie with the same implications would be seen as re-hashing an observation already made by Hitchcock.  \\"Inception\\" is not the first to address the nature of dreaming, and the manner in which it addresses it is ultimately derivative and conservative in nature.    In the end, \\"Inception\\" is a tepid, conservative, safe, and derivative movie about dreams, made for American audiences who are not tough on their filmmakers (there is a reason Inception has suffered with foreign audiences who have seen much more creative fair), to make them feel all tingly all over.  Eventually time will show that Nolan was asleep on the job.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|For me, this movie score transcends the film itself and has been part of my own life's soundtrack. I listen to it when I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I need to be reminded of my purpose on the planet, or when I simply want it to take me away from the hard reality of life. This music is a portal to a calmer, simpler and stunning place. When I first started to collect movie scores, it was in the early 90s and I foolishly expected there to be many, many scores as good as this one. Here I am 20 years later, and this one is right there near the top of my collection. This is a must-own movie score.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|This cd was a definite good buy! The cd works wonderfully, and I recomend to buy from the seller...its a good buy!
0553381687|5.0|This sweeping tale reminded me just how good an epic fantasy tale could be. I was completely engrossed, the world building is excellently done and following the stories of each of the characters makes for a compelling read. Very much looking forward to reading this entire series.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I must admit, I wasn't expecting much from this album. I had no plans to buy it until I heard some song samples, which I did last week. I was impressed enough to buy the CD. Overall, I think \\"Clapton\\" is one of EC's best albums of the last 20 years, rivaling \\"Out of the Cradle and Unplugged,\\" in my opinion. In terms of style, it reminds me of \\"Backless\\" and \\"Slowhand\\"; it has a smooth, easy groove that some may mistake as \\"elevator music, but I think this is missing the point. Clapton has done and seen it all, and contributed tons to the music industry, and at 65 years young, he deserves to make the album *HE* wants to make. And \\"Clapton\\" sounds just like that: a man freed from expectations, making an album with some old friends and just kicking back and having a blast. The groove and joy of music-making is infectious, and at no point do I think EC is coasting. He's just having fun. And that's what makes the album a triumph and a gem in Slowhand's catalog. It's music made by a senior citizen who's approaching music with the wide-eyed enthusiasm of a twenty-something. Refreshing stuff indeed.
B003TXKSWK|4.0|This album isn't perfect...but it is very good.  Mr. Legend and The Roots make a cool soulful album with a lot of hope in the sound.  I think this is one album that a lot of people can enjoy, meaning that even if you don't like soul music...you would find something wonderful here, just listen with an open heart.   This album has many magical Moments.  John's voice sounds as good as ever, I wish Melanie was used for a couple more tracks as they sound great together, I also wish the rap was not included on the few tracks that it is, it kinda ruins the feel of the album....but hey that is just my opinion.   Pick this one up, there are great moments throughout.
B001E3AXGS|4.0|Team of Rivals is an excellent book and an easy read.  It provides insight into Lincoln that is unique in many areas and gives one understanding and appreciation for Lincoln's relationship with his cabinet and generals.  This book is not intended to be a history of the Civil War or a battle-by-battle military recitation, but the author does a great job providing perspective and context to the goings on around the President; the reader cannot help but learn about the history of the amazing 1860's.    There are a few quirky passages that don't seem to fit - the most notable being a five page 19th century theater/ psychotherapy lesson on pages 609 - 614, and a sometimes stale use of adjectives - you'll read \\"radical\\" or \\"conservative\\" before the same individuals name a dozen times throughout the book, and Gen. McClellen is referred to as \\"Young Napoleon\\" at what seems like every mention.    These small complaints do very little to take away from a great story about Lincoln - one of the great men of history - and the tremendous team who labored along side of him during America's greatest struggle.  I would recommend Team of Rivals to anyone looking to get to know Lincoln, and especially to those seeking an learn about the inner workings of his administration and the heroic war effort. The reader cannot help but gain respect and admiration for the men Goodwin so eloquently chronicles; Seward, Stanton, Grant are heroic figures in their own right.
B003U9V6A6|4.0|I like this album.  I don't think it sounds quit as good as their first, but it is great for a second album.  There is still a lot of soul in this group, and the slight hip-hop feel is still in tact but here it is more subdued.  I feel that this group should be bigger than they are.  They are hard workers and it shows.  It is all about marketing these days...and these guys are very marketable, but for some reason the record company that backs them isn't really backing them as they should be, unlike similar sounding bands Moron5(typo on purpose) or OneRepublic who are shoved down our throats.  The Script is similar BUT BETTER than both of these bands don't get me wrong I do like OneRepublic but not as much as The Script... So if you like Moron5 (typo on purpose) or OneRepublic CHECK out The Script you may like them better.
0525951652|1.0|Why should the customer be forced to pay the same amount for a digital download as for a hardcover book. The hardcover book requires labor and materials to produce. The digital version requires nothing! I will NEVER pay $19.99 for a book that I can't even lend to a friend, or one that Amazon could magically remove from any e-device as they see it, as they've done in the past.     This pricing strategy is outrageous! Hopefully the consumer will make a stand on this issue and refuse to accept this pricing!
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|Is Nassau 76, the concert included here, the best live album? - in my opinion, it is, yes.    Has the official CD of it got the odd defect, as some have alleged? I won't disagree with all the negative points I've read here and there about this set.    However myriad software, the easy availability of facilities to write reviews online has turned a lot of us into armchair critics...    Dig deep, or simply give any album - even a classic one - a cursory listen and there will be \\"imperfections\\" we can fuss over.    The bigger picture here is that this release features one of the best concerts ever, and it has a lot to offer compared to any prior (bootleg) release. As noted elsewhere, there are minor differences in the sound - for instance that of the guitars - on this mix compared to other versions fans will have heard. Both the rhythm guitar and lead guitar can be heard the most vividly yet...you can hear practically every note clearly, and yet the recording still retains the atmosphere of this very exciting gig, which is no mean feat.    For those unsure of whether to take the plunge on this CD set, focussing on the live album, these are some of the positive points and clearest / most obvious differences between this release and earlier recordings of the Nassau '76 gig -    Starting with Station To Station, it's been claimed this is one of the most exciting songs in Bowie's catalogue once it gets going, and I won't disagree. On the live version here, with the first thud of the bass drum - the presence is so clear! You could imagine being onstage amongst the musicians. Also the backing vocals are much clearer too, and while much has been made of a little too much focus on the drums elsewhere, on here it's just right...the skipping drumming is amazing!    Moving on to the next track, Suffragette City, the rhythm guitar sounds clearer and much less compressed and less 'countrified' than on prior versions of this concert. Very clear drumming, again, which is a good thinghere. There's also a nice pre Michaal Jackson-esque \\"ooh!!\\" at the end of the track, followed by a laugh, both of which had been edited out of the familiar FM broadcast version.    On Stay in particular, once more the funky rhythm guitar part, care of Carlos, here is much more audible, and this is a good thing...    Waiting For The Man  This is where this set really starts to come into its own...this track, along with Life On Mars / Five Years, had only been heard via the Bowienet site before, and both this track and the latter medley had cuts due to tape errors.  Thankfully a complete dub has been found of both.  This is great news, as these songs are no outtakes, and fortify an already wonderful concert!  This version of the Velvet Underground song also includes this poem    \\"No hill's too steep  No mountain's too tall  ...With hope and Faith  You can conquer them all\\"    paraphrasing Helen Steiner Rice's inspirational piece...high drama in the last 'feeling so good, feeling so fine...\\" chorus too!    Next up is Queen Bitch. This song did get a brief release on the RarestOneBowie CD, albeit in a different mix here - ie keyboard centre, guitars left and right channel as per the rest of this release, as opposed to the keyboard in one channel, lead guitar in the other, rhythm guitar central on the Rarest CD, and the rather clinically mixed extras on the earlier Station to Station CD.    Life on Mars / Five Years  This medley is mesmerising...I've waited so long to hear this complete and in excellent quality.  As noted above, this was incomplete on an earlier 'broadcast' on Bowienet, due to a tape fault. Thankfully a complete tape has been found - quite possibly not first generation, as some have alleged - but the songs sound simply beautiful here. Relax and enjoy.    Panic in Detroit - the backing vocals are clearer, and this edit works well!    A minor detail but it's nice to have the extended crowd, anticipating / cheering for an encore, in between Diamond Dogs and Rebel Rebel too.    On The Jean Genie the blistering guitar solo here sounds cleared and better than ever, and again, the extended croud cheering outro helps with the atmosphere of the gig.    So...for every negative comment about the presentation of the gig / whole box here, I believe there is a positive to counter it.    Whether you have a recording of the Nassau gig or not, you either gain a fantastic album and gig that you have not got, or at the very least one with some bonuses you didn't have, so what's there to lose?    Take the plunge and enjoy it!
B002VPE1XE|4.0|Nice little case, but more for random electronic bits than specific gear.  It is way to big for my few years old ruggedized Olympus point and shoot.  In fact, it could hold two of 'em.  Or the camera and all the cords and charger bits.    Maybe it's intended for a compact video camera.  Dunno, haven't bought one yet.    The zippered front pocket is well sized for holding memory cards.  Perhaps a spare battery too.  It is nice that it can be accessed without opening the main flap.    The sides are somewhat padded but not well padded.  I'd have scored this case a 5 on materials if the sides had about twice the thickness.  As for the outer material and workmanship, no problem.  Functional and not likely to shred without a fair amount of abuse.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|I read this to the end which I only do if a book keeps my attention. However overall I am challenged to say it's great fiction.<br /><br />This story has elements that would challenge any writer. It's long (over 600 pages). It covers 4 generations and over 100 years. It wants to be gothic, modern and a fairy tale. It's a tragedy, a love story, a family feud and attempts at redemption. The result is an interesting story but inconsistent. The book seemingly focuses on one central character,  Nell. But then it becomes much more a story of Eliza before ultimately settling on modern day Cassandra. As a reader I am investing in the central characters and this was hard to do here.  The very frequent jumping around of time periods are largely unnecessary. If I were her editor I would have asked for one edition in linear format. It likely would lead to a shorter tighter story as I think there is some fluff here. And I don't think the reader loses anything. Some events can be moved around for dramatic effect but I just don't see what the benefit is to the reader for more; particularly as the main characters have almost no overlap.<br /><br />There are seemingly insurmountable plot twists that unwind more easily than perhaps they should. Letters that show up at just the right time or old documents that are well preserved or other clues that seem to come to easily. In that sense unwinding the riddle seems a bit more unearned than I thought it should.  I accept that there is supposed to be an air fantasy with each character having exaggerated emotions or actions and therefore I should suspend reality but I think there some areas where plausibility is too stretched.  While there are elements of fantasy this is also trying to tell a very empathetic story of a woman who is alienated by information at a young age that she is not who she thought she was and how this sours her whole life. I see writing style conflict here that should be better resolved.<br /><br />I found the ending to somewhat abandon the dark theme and lack of redemption which is prevalent for most of the story.  As we neared the end  I felt like I was being instructed to see that it all works out rather than being convinced.he dark theme and lack of redemption which is prevalent for most of the story.

B003UERZ88|5.0|For those that gave this album a two, you all need to get a guitar or try to sign like Halford in any of the songs on this album. And when you go get around 25% as good as Halford sounds, then you might be able to say a word. Until then hush and mind your business. Halford is the king of metal, and his performance with JUDAS PRIEST, FIGHT, TWO, and HALFORD brought the best music. His music influenced a lot of bands even such as Metallica, Exodus, Forbidden, Slayer, etc etc. So lets give this great musician a little credit. If you do not like songs like Fire and Ice, Like there is no tomorrow, till the day i die, twenty five years, the mower, than you are not having a good ear for metal sound. THIS ALBUM rocks from the beginning to the end. HALFORD-THE METALGOD is alive and well. Long Live Halford, Long Live the King of Metal.  for the one mentioning \\"to not include metal with sports\\", when was the last time you were at a foorball game? you never heard a rock song being played that pumps you up for your team? get real people, this is HALFORD and his music rocks no matter what. I think that even when he will be in his coufin, you will hear sing and his voice will rock your ears. HE IS THE METALGOD, and that name fits him well. if you like Halford, you will definetely love this album. I wish he would have another album next week because i would buy it.
B000F3T7X8|5.0|This is a group in full swing, not only exploring new directions but really showing their well developed skills as individuals but their ability as a group. Swing here typifies their power. Burning Bridges the next track goes in a totally different direction as the mood completely changes, their use of synths here to introduce the song you know something good will follow; one of the moodiest sax solos. My New Career follows what a great song. A very strong album. Very well done.
1416594795|1.0|Blind watchmaker II perhaps, Dawkins seems to have little interest in observing nature. On p.384 he references  the cheetah as a superlative killer.    If you observe many programs from NG or other, the cheetah is a better sprinter   - only a good but not super killer compared to a leopard, hyena or lion.     Dawkins is wrong about no prudent killers (except humans) too.  In fact a hyena is quite a prudent killer, tracking cheetahs to steal their kills from them - with no attempt to do anything to the cat but drive it off. -This cat is a meal ticket for this brute.    Who's side is the designer on? - he derides - but isn't that a question  from a   human perspective - contradicting what he believes and states elsewhere that   our concept and the appearance of design is just a human perspective of events?   Perhaps Dawkins perspective is a little distorted and unaware of his basic contradictions.    Also he seems to be unaware of the folly of \\"Darwinian struggle\\"  as the agent of   evolution - modern thinking is that \\"cooperation and mutual aid\\" are more significant. (see \\"What is Life? by Hans-Peter Durr .. also on Amazon and others)    From p.8 on he as in other books is on a silly \\"crusade\\" against you know who and what book.     This book however is worth being used in class as an example of pseudo-science (it was   in the Science section (?) in B-A-M ) and as a case study in years to come of rank journalism masquerading as Science and how to draw wrong conclusions from the forensics around us to fit one's world view.    \\"It is the plain truth ... we are cousins of chimpanzees\\" he writes but I think it is better for the rest of us if he spoke for himself [p.s. current research shows little in common between humans and chimpanzees.](excepting RD perhaps :) )
B003XU02QG|2.0|I love fantasy movies, and usually don't even need a good story, but this film is just undeveloped and empty. Beautifully empty, though. The locations have great variety: mountains, rivers, forests. The costumes are detailed and look authentic on both sides. The fighting is ok: nice weapons and armor, but filmed with too many quick camera cuts. The characters are attractive: the hunter looks mysterious and the Roman leader looks leader-ish. But again there is an emptiness: there is little personality displayed at all. The story is at times not just empty, it is absurd. An entire legion follows one Pictish woman? 7 wounded and tired men on foot evade a skilled tracking party on horseback in their native land? The trackers get within range of a throwing axe and lose them? The tracker sees no signs inside or outside the hut that the Romans were with the witch? The hunted decide to fight what looks like an evenly matched hunting party only after running hundreds of miles, starving, and losing half their men? Thax the Roman just appears one night after so many miles and gets such a chilly reception as if anyone could know killing the Pict child would start the hunt, and then draws his sword on another Roman within site of Hadrian's Wall? Just bizarre.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|This is a great collection and the Season Play feature has been simply brilliant! Having literally everything in one box (pretty cool one at that) really makes it convenient to get 'lost' in one of tv's greatest dramas.  I am a proud owner of this series as I think it sticks out as a unique achievement in TV, it has the production value of a Hollywood feature, it just takes about 3 months of nightly watching to get through the twists, turns and mind-grenades!    Highly recommended, although plan on losing about 10% productivity, at least, after its arrival!    Enjoy!
B003UYV08E|3.0|This is an intense action film at points. But at other points there seems to be too much cross-talk between Stark and his CEO (I find her voice to be particularly irritating). While the film has its moments, the producers of the film have a hidden agenda, that is to keep the Iron Man movies as a profitable franchise.<br /><br />Stark comes across as a spoilt brat that wants the world to be at his beck and call. The unit in his chest is slowly killing him and he resorts to recklessness as a solution. I feel that a successful person at that level would have been more mature and responsible.<br /><br />The final battle scene is at night ... again a bit of a let down.<br /><br />In order to set the stage for the next sequel, there are scenes with Samuel Jackson, who is the head of some sort of Justice League group and alludes to his troubles in the south-west. These scenes do not really add any present value to the film but ensures that the franchise will survive.
0394827996|5.0|An engaging fable with witty illustrations, FISH IS FISH begins with two \\"fish\\" that are best friends and go through life's changes when one transforms into a frog and through sustaining friendship and their own adventures, both realize and attain happiness within their unique worlds. Superb simple story highlighted with humorous imagination, kids will learn the differences/similarities of minnow and tadpole and  laugh at the pages when fish starts to dream about the creatures frog sees on the land in his own image - bird fish, cow fish, human and children fish. The subtle moral themes and artfully use of collage that have made Leo Lionni a \\"master of the simple fable\\" as hailed by Chicago Tribute can also be seen in his other Caldecott Honor books like FREDERICK, SWIMMY and INCY BY INCH.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0394826140 Frederick]]<br />[[ASIN:0394826205 Swimmy (Knopf Children's Paperbacks)]]<br />[[ASIN:0688132839 Inch by Inch]]

I will be happy to wait until the price drops to a reasonable level for the e-version or, if it does not, I will purchase a used hardcopy so I can also recycle the book and keep the publisher from enjoying an excessive profit margin.

0143034901|5.0|Either Zafron is a great author, the English translation is excellent, or perhaps both statements are true. Set in 1950s Barcelona with a subplot played out during the Spanish Civil War, the characters come alive through rich dialog and anchoring to real-life locations. In particular, the lucious conversation from Fermin was a delight to read.<br /><br />The reader is surprised to discover ways the current characters and the earlier subplot mirror and parallel each other. Indeed, it must have taken intricate planning on the part of the author to weave all the pieces together so seamlessly.<br /><br />It's an excellent read. As a recent tourist in Barcelona, I particularly enjoyed the walking guide at the back of the book linking the locations in the story with the map of Barcelona.
0553582461|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read highly recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and fantasy books
B003UERZ88|1.0|This disc is nothing like Resurrection or Crucible. This disc has not 1 stand out track or anything remotely close to being as creative or heavy as anything Rob recorded with Fight or Halford. His Christmas disc was horrendous and now this. C'Mon Rob...stay heavy!  When we shell out 15 bucks for this junk, we have every right to criticize or praise it as we see or hear it. Not everyone will agree with all reviews but I think someone who has listened to metal for 30 years  is quite capable of reviewing it for what it's worth.

B003L20IHO|5.0|This was an amazing movie. But if you don't like movies that have heartbreaking sad parts that stick with you after you finish the movie don't buy this one. Otherwise you're in for a very well put together heart full, and touching movie. At times the plot line is hard to follow. But I think if you can tell what's going to happen and when, the movie maker hasn't done their job. In this case you are hooked on the story and the acting the entire time. The moments between Charlie and his brother Sam where very heart warming and also heart breaking. All these things are the mark of a wonderful movie. It has a very good message: you can love your family forever, even if they are no longer with you, but you must also live your life. Zac Efron has come a long way from High School Musical. I think he could go the distance as an actor. The same can be said for his young co-star, Charlie Tahan, who played Sam St. Cloud. He was very convincing every second he was on the screen. I cried every moment it was intended with him. I think he also has a bright future as an actor. I really latched onto them both. Which means they where good at their parts. I give this movie, which will stay with me for a long time, a 10/10.

0312370849|5.0|I don't normally care for this style of writing; switching back and forth between characters.  However, it really worked in this book because I found myself always wanting to get back to the one I just left.  Sarah's Key draws you into the lives of both characters.  It is a heart breaking story about a subject we know very little of as far as the French involvement in the lives of Jews during WWII.  I found myself wanting to know more.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|Michael Douglas and Sean Penn star in this 1997 thriller.<br />A wealthy businessman is drawn into a mysterious game<br />after his brother gives him a birthday present.

B002N5N5M0|3.0|Dexter Seasons 1 & 2 are FIVE STAR shows all the way.<br /><br />Season 3 with Jimmy Smitts dropped to 4 stars as they perpetuated the storyline by having Dexter act out of character.<br />Dexter almost became a secondary character that season.<br /><br />Now we look at this product ..... Season 4......<br /><br />What was the problem ??<br /><br />By the 4th episode it was easy to see the entire storyline for the full season, even a guess at the \\"surprising\\" ending.<br /><br />My wife thought I was joking when I told her after 4 episodes I had the whole season figured out.<br />She made me write down my guesses and seal it an envelope.<br />Months later when the season ended, she opened the envelope and said .. \\"Darn, you had it all right\\".<br /><br />Dexter is still a great show concept.<br />But Season #4 suffered from what I call \\"Churning\\".<br /><br />Churning is where you run down the clock and burn up time by having nothing really happen except filler material and having the characters do stupid things to create plot twists.<br /><br />In Season 4, you can watch the first four episodes and the last 3 episodes and you have 99% of the story.<br />The middle 5 episodes are filled with nothing but romantic interest side stories (that seem forced and un-natural).<br /><br />Additionally after the mistakes Dexter made (and should have learned from) in Season 3, this Season is in many ways a rehash of Dexter once again acting out of character and creating problems for himself (and others) by doing the dumbest things possible.<br />All of which perpetuate the story and make simple problems much bigger than they needed to be.<br /><br />I like stories when a situation becomes difficult for characters because of tough unexpected circumstances that are heaped upon them.<br /><br />I get a bit dissapointed when writers stretch out a story simply by having the main characters do the dumbest and most illogical things possible -or- have them act totally out of character.<br /><br />Still, these comments are all relative.<br /><br />A 3-star Dexter is still much better than most other shows on TV.<br /><br />I have heard that the writers themselves were not too happy with Seasons 3-4,  and did some serious discussions to get Dexter \\"back on track\\" and \\"back in character\\" for Season 5.<br /><br />So we may once again see a 5-star rating for the upcoming Season 5 ...........  yeah !!!!!I have heard that the writers themselves were not too happy with Seasons 3-4,  and did some serious discussions to get Dexter \\"back on track\\" and \\"back in character\\" for Season 5.    So we may once again see a 5-star rating for the upcoming Season 5 ...........  yeah !!!!!

B0000A0DRY|4.0|I don't believe Surrealistic Pillow is Jefferson Airplane's very best album, despite all the attention and popularity it has received over the years (mostly due to featuring the bands two biggest hits- \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\", the latter a song that never really appealed to me a whole lot).    The main appeal of the album comes from all the *other* songs, such as \\"She Has Funny Cars\\" with its bouncy and relatively complex vocal melody, the pop perfection that is \\"My Best Friend\\", and the eerie flute build-up in \\"Comin' Back to Me\\".  I originally didn't care for this track all that much, but the flute playing eventually leads way to a psychadelic vocal melody that DOES improve with repeated listens.    \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Second\\" is a bit dated and noisy, however underneath all that noise lies a pretty great melody, and \\"How Do You Feel\\" is another memorable track.    I don't know guys, albums like After Bathing at Baxter's and Crown of Creation appeal to me a little bit more overall with slightly improved songwriting and *significantly* improved guitar playing, but Surrealistic Pillow is a nice early effort by the band.

B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is fantastic.  I have used the Steelseries 5Hv2 for the better part of 3 years and I feel that this blows it out of the water.  The surround sound sounds great and the mic quality is great.  I have shown it to all my gamer friends and they want to pick up one for themselves.      The only drawback is that the software for the G keys does not currently work with Ventrilo.  This is a minor annoyance and once it's fixed I will be able to chat with friends while I am sitting on my couch.
0525951652|1.0|I understand the frustration of those wanting a review of this book's content.  I've read you comments and I agree to a point.  The problem is the publisher made this book unaffordable for much of their readership and the fact that the ebook version is more expensive then the hardcover.  This just goes too far. Shame on Penguin.  Boycott!!!!!!!!!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Wow,guess I'll be reading the hardback edition. Amazon and Kindle definitely not living up to the promises of lower pricers for bestsellers.
044654759X|5.0|When I first read the book summary I already guessed that Katie and Alex would fall in love somehow and have some sort of issue.  Somewhat predictable.  I wasn't overly excited to ready the book, but its Nicholas Sparks so I had to.  I have to say this is one of his best books.  It was full of so much suspense I didn't want to stop reading towards the end.  It certain wasn't the normal over the heels in love romance Sparks usually writes.    The book follows Katie who is running away from her abusive past.  I felt so bad for her when reading about what she'd been through.  Even knowing she'd escaped; when I was reading about how she did it I was scared for her that she was going to get caught and not get away from her husband.  The descriptions of what happened to her were so real and felt through the pages.      Then when the POV of Kevin was added in I wanted to punch him and felt slightly sorry for him.  His thoughts reflected that he thought he was doing things right when he was completely crazy and needed help.  It showed how he'd convinced himself that he wasn't in the wrong and Katie should have been thankful to be with him.    The kids were great characters and Alex was a grounded character who was very understanding.  Especially at the end.     The only thing in the book I wished he had done different was the character of Jo.  I know he was trying to link everything together, but Katie's thoughts were just a little too real to be imagining.  I would have thought I was completely crazy if I figured that about Jo.  Finding out the truth about Jo was a surprise though.      Overall I loved the book.  It's turned into one of my favorites by him and I can't wait for the next one.
B00138GXYU|5.0|Out of all of her albums, this one is perhaps my most favorite.    My favorites out of this album are: Gimme More, Piece of Me, Break The Ice, Toy Soldier and Ooh Ooh Baby. I was pretty sad that Toy Soldier wasn't released but I was surprised that she performed Ooh Ooh Baby on her Circus tour. That really took me by surprise.
B002R9LQ5K|5.0|35:55, classic Booth or as Brennan would put it...\\"Boothy\\". this is such an entertaining series. If I can't have a fifth season of Firefly then this will do very nicely (FOX you vermin for cancelling Firefly)
B002ZG98UA|2.0|I thought it took too long to get interesting. I think that Resident Evil Extinction has been the best of the series so far. Some of it is starting to seem a little far fetched. I know I'm splitting hairs but I find it hard to believe they flew a helicopter from Las Vegas to Alaska without refueling. I love the series and I'll definately buy it on Blu-Ray when it comes out. You know there's going to be another installment from the way this one ended. Guys, take your time and don't rush it out, a little waiting never killed anyone.
0393072231|5.0|This book is not only well written, with built-in suspense, stocked with illuminating characters -- mostly anti-Wall Street establishment -- who saw the subprime mortgage disaster coming and bet on the collapse, but it finally explains to my satisfaction what a subprime mortgage bond is as well as the other impenetrable financial instruments such as credit swap defaults and Asset Backed Securities and Collateral Debt Obligations which came close to bringing down the world financial market.  I am recommending this book because I think it is very important that people with no particular interest in the financial system in this country educate themselves in this respect.  The main reasons for the collapse was a mostly unregulated bond market, securitization of instruments that were like nicely wrapped Xmas gifts one could not open to see what was inside, the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing, a frenzy of optimism without the slightest cause, too damn much money at all levels, a stampede to make bad mortgage loans -- not to put people into houses -- but to create more of these Asset Backed Securities in the absurd expectation that housing prices would always rise just ahead of the foreclosures. This madness was furthered by the credit rating agencies (S&P and Moody's) who operated as minions to the big Wall St. firms and did their bidding without questions, packaging essentially worthless securites with AAA ratings.  I suggest that after reading this book you investigate how the banking system works and why we are drowning in debt and the federal govt. pays exorbitant interest on OUR money taking out loans instead of creating money which the Treasury Dept. has the power to do.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|The item came on time, new, perfect.  Very satisfied with the purchase of our favorite series. We will be missing \\"Lost\\" we would have liked to be for a lot of more years ...
0893860220|5.0|This book consists of a series of interviews ('darshans') through which Nisargadatta  answers the basic question which reveals our human condition: while everyone wants to be THAT (Self, Enlightened, Realized) we do not want to let go of our accumulated beliefs, desires and perceived needs. Many questions asked of the master display a subtle desperation inherent in this predicament.<br /><br />Thirst for the divine can't be met because we are looking for answers away from the Source. In this book, this thirst  meets the rock-solid, unyielding, uncompromising presence of the master.<br /><br />When reading this book i keep saying to myself without intending to - \\"i love this man\\". The interviews give me a sense of trust, of direction, of presence.<br /><br />A great book.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|Is everyone reviewing the same book here?    This page turning series is one of the best I have ever read.    If you all (3 star and below) want to write a book, then just keep writing lousy reviews.
B003WKFAIW|4.0|This is a great effort by Maroon 5 in releasing a great CD titled \\"Hands All Over\\". This is their third studio album. The album is produced by the legendary Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange : a great hard working composer & producer known for his works with Def Leppard, AC/DC, Bryan Adams, Shania Twain & Heart among many others. The album is mixed by Mike Shipley & was recorded in Switzterland. Solid/excellent tracks (rated 5 stars) include, \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\", track 5, my favourite track from this great album & hence the title of my review, \\"How\\" &  the closing track, \\"Out Of Goodbyes\\", a great \\"duet\\" with Lady Antebellum : excellent song with great guitar & vocals. Other notable tracks (rated 4 stars) include, \\"Runnaway\\", \\"Just A Feeling\\", \\"I Can't Lie\\", \\"Don't Know Nothing\\" & the opening track & first single/video, \\"Misery\\". The remaining 4 tracks (rated 3 stars) are just ok songs, \\"Give Me A Little More\\", \\"Stutter\\", \\"Hands All Over\\" & \\"Get Back In My Life\\". There is no weak track in this CD, \\"Hands All Over\\", but the band needs to \\"Give A Little More\\" to earn 5 stars. Maroon 5 lists their influences among others being Stevie Wonder, Jamiroquai, Hall and Oats & Prince : I feel these great artists will be quite impressed with this great effort by this great band, a highly recommended listening!
B003TML0VO|5.0|Dont get the negativism one little bit.    The album if fantastic for all kinds of reasons.    Did any of you nay sayings morons even bother listening to the album more than once?    People that like Carlos will love this album. I suggest the bubble gum chewing crowd not dishonor the man and his extraordinary talent.

1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House refers to the separate facility in a planatation home, where the food was cooked, to ensure that the main house would not catch on fire from the cooking fire.    The story is told from the perspective of Lavinia, who is an indentured servant, taken into the home of a wealthy sea captain who owns a plantation in Virginia.  There is also another narrative, from Belle Pyke, who is mixed race and is a slave on the plantation.    Lavinia is a frightened child when she is brought to live at Tall Oaks, the sea captain's plantation home. She is befriended and loved by Belle and the other slaves on the plantation since she is relegated to living with the slaves.  Lavinia thinks of the slaves as her family and Belle is like a mother to her as well as Mama Mae, the head cook on the plantation.    The family who owns the slaves has quite a troubled pass since, Belle is the daughter of Captain Pyke.  Captain Pyke loves Belle and it causes problems for Belle later in life with Captain Pyke's son, Marshall.    The story plays out into Lavinia's young womanhood and there are many sad moments in this story as we listen to Belle's and Lavinia's story.    If you love historical novels, you will love this one.  I could not put this down.  My only comment about the story is the ending was very abrupt and I would like to have known what happened in later years to Lavinia and some of the slaves from Tall Oaks.  Well worth reading.
0743277708|5.0|An epic adventure akin in many ways to Lord of the Rings, but with rabbits instead of hobbits.  It's not just for kids - people of all ages will heartily enjoy this book.
0385342047|5.0|Becky is back and her very own mini-me, her 2 year old daughter, Minnie, has joined forces with her mother.    Sophie Kinsella's latest book was just plain fun and a real hoot.  I have missed Becky's antics and this story did not disappoint.    From some hilarious scenes at Minnie's christening, to a real laugh out loud moment in a shopping mall where Minnie becomes enthralled with a store mannequin, Mini-Shopaholic was just plain old fun to read.    I saw some of the reviews here and they are pretty negative but I have to say that Sophie Kinsella is in top form and Becky, Luke, Suze, Tarquie, and their families are a laugh a minute.    Really enjoyable!
B000063CPL|5.0|I have been a Maiden fan since Killers. I was 11 years old back then. I am 41 today and I did witness them opening the brave new world tour in Paris back in 2000. Brave New World is my all time favourite album ever. It is an absolute master piece and the live in Rio is a testimony of how wonderful the South American audience can be. The band is at its best. Bruce sings so awesome and the fact that they played \\"The sign of the cross\\" with Bruce on vocals makes this live album a \\"must have\\" for any Maiden fan. If you want to buy one Maiden album, buy this live because Maiden is \\"a Live band\\" and whether you look at the sound quality, the choice of the songs, the performance from each member or the quality of the audience, this live album is one of a kind. If you want to get the big picture, get the DVD! It is just fantastic and it has gone down in price I believe.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|I am not going to box Clapton to music he created in the 60's and early 70's.  The man deserves to experiment and does not have to prove anything to anyone.  The music is outstanding with a healthy mix of Blues/Jazz/Rock + the classic Autumn Leaves.  Hard Times Blues takes me back to my Pre-War Blues collection, Can't Hold Out Much Longer sounds very much like the tunes from From the Cradle, while There's No Way to Get Along reminds me of New Orleans Jazz/Blues.  The songs with JJ sound laid back as they should be and Autumn Leaves sounds different as it should be.  Overall, a great addition to my music collection.
B003SJ4VJ6|2.0|The movie was very mediocre. The plot was a bit slow and boring at times. If you don't see this movie, you want miss much.
B000OP1M6M|4.0|Arrived new but without instruction booklet. My Omega automatic Seamaster is about 10 years old and never cleaned and runs - 15 sec/d. This Seiko runs + 10 sec/d. Although the Omega may need service, I'm not upset by the Seiko performance. I dislike the fact that isn't Japan Made, the cheap feel of the crown screwdown function ( doesn't give waterproof sensation when tightening ) and the lack of hacking mechanism. The 7S26 Seiko machine can't be winded by the crown but I've read it needs less maintenance that most swiss luxury automatics. If this model had the SKX031K2 bracelet and the metal borders around the hour marks and the date window, the hacking and crown winding, it would be hard to beat.
B003WSFXKY|4.0|Actually, just after I pre-ordered this CD, I thought I might have made a mistake.  An entire CD of covers with Carlos Santana doing his interpretation of rock guitar classics?  Well........... it arrived on time from Amazon prime, and I shoved it into my CD/DVD player, and cranked up the volume.  No looking back here, kids and classic rock fans ~ I loved it!!!  No regrets!!! Carlos does it again.  Here's my recent Facebook post, I think it says it all:                       ================= ================= =================  Permanently lost another 2% of my total hearing capacity listening to this album at -4 dB. That would be an endorsement. Medicare does pay for hearing aids, right?

B001HQZJP2|4.0|Okay! I bought it and liked it. Lots of action to these movies. Great audio and video. I think next time I get a series of movies like these I will not watch them one-after-the-other. After watching too much at one time I feel that I was exhausted with the Mummy theme after I started watching the third movie. I suggest giving each movie a breather before watching the next movie with a fresh start.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Some reviewers will write a \\"Deep Frozen Water\\" or \\"Jaws with Paws\\" style of review.  That might be a valid criticism except most moves have been \\"done\\".  I am not sure that we have much \\"original\\" movies, books or television.  I am not looking for a deep message or an original concept but do want to be entertained.<br />This is an entertaining move.  The story is believable, the dialog accurate and the failing of the system on target.  The result is a solid story, well filmed that is enjoyable.  If you like movies pitting kids against an implacable foe, you should like this one.
142313494X|5.0|Not since Stanek's Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches have I liked the first in series so much. Personally, I never thought I'd love Greek mythology; however, people who hate mythology could enjoy this book. I did. It all begins with a letter of warning about discovering yourself. This gets the readers attention, and forces them to continue on with the story.     Percy Jackson is just an ADHD, dyslexic troublemaker who gets kicked out from any school he goes to. He then finds out that he's a son of Poesiden. Now, then he ends up with a hurricane in montawk and gets an unexpected visit from the mighty minotaur at the top of half-blood hill. Oh and he discovers that one of his friends is plotting to destroy Olympus and the reign of the gods. Trust me, you don't want to miss it!
B00000I8UD|4.0|Generally regarded as one of his weaker works, I've come to appreciate this album due to it's spiritual importance to the artist and a sense of identity I feel with its \\"message\\". This is not to say the album overtly or even covertly attempts to make a statement, but from the first kit kick of \\"I Surrender\\" to the fading light of \\"Darkest Dreaming\\" you could say I am somewhat mesmerized by the whole experience.    A common complaint of the work is how the album flows. Objectively I must agree with this statement, but once again personal listening experiences vary and I am no different. For me, this album fits (to a point).    So by ignoring the inclusion of my personal opinion, I can only recommend you listen before purchasing. There are simply too many varying views on the matter.      Best Quotes (From Previous Reviews):    \\"what it lacks is the presence of a unique music design\\" [Flavio Russo]

0312330537|5.0|A read like SHANTARAM doesn't come along very often.  Nothing short of fantastic can describe Mr. Robert's epic story.  How one creates a fictional tale that is so real, has always amazed me.  Gregory David Roberts has done just that.  The characters are real...the places are real...and the adventures throughout this wonderful book are so real, you will find yourself taking part in the struggles, and triumphs of every character the author brings to life.  Words cannot describe the story in words.  (AN OLD EXPRESSION, BUT EVER SO TRUE)  Whether you read the book, or listen to it on disc, you will understand exactly what I am talking about.<br />Exquisite and brilliant are the only two words that come to my mind about the story of SHANTARAM!
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Presented as a series of letters between an established author and her publisher, this book takes place in London, the English Countryside, and the protectorate island of Guernsey during a war-tired 1946. A fast read, the book is laugh out loud funny (if you've got a dry sense of humor) albeit a little sappy. The ending is predictable and sudden but doesn't detract. 4 stars out of 5.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|The film The Social Network by David Fincher, was based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich. I have now read the book and seen the film and I found both to be incredibly compelling stories. On the surface, both stories seem pretty identical with some varying bits of info differing between the two as well as different vehicles used for storytelling. As far as the film goes, it was told very well and was very compelling to watch. It was beautifully photographed and the score by Trent Reznor was awesome too, as was the acting.<br /><br />Despite my having known the entire story from the book, which can often bring about negative film watching results, this film went far further than the simple who, what, when, where, and why details in it. Mark Zuckerberg's girlfriend breaks up with him in the first 5 minutes of the film and I believe this becomes the catalyst for what is driving him in the film. And who knows, perhaps in real life too.<br /><br />The film is most definitely going to define this time period too, or at least the point in time that something important began, ie; social Internet sites connecting humanity as never before.<br /><br />A great film about the Internet has not really come about until now and I feel it's because despite the Internet having been around for some time now it has not until recently begun to exploit its full potential.  Facebook and The Social Network show just what the future of the Internet holds, possibilities and pitfalls alike. It's not a business model like Ebay or an information model like Google, but it's a social one. And humans, before business and even information, are social, which is why Facebook can often be so addictive and other sites are not. We socialize before we learn to speak and I feel that the social relevance is at the heart of The Social Network. Although advertising for soda, cars, toys and whatever is what makes Facebook financially viable, ultimately, that's not why we log on. We are there for each other and the ads follow us around like puppies wherever we go.<br /><br />This is also the story about a single man and a fallible man at that.  Films that show perfect heroes rarely stand the test of time, but imperfect protagonists, people we can all relate to on some level, are the ones we keep revisiting as we grow and age, and hopefully we become wiser in the process. Obviously, I do not know Mark Zuckerberg personally, but I do know myself, the mistakes I've made, and the errors in judgment, the missed opportunities, and the homeruns. It is this very real, fallible, human aspect that I can relate to the most in the film. Mark Zuckerberg seems like a very real character in the film, just like all of us, imperfect. In his case he's still growing, learning about people, and wet behind the ears. Ironically and certainly not lost on the filmmakers one bit, Zuckerberg's social skills have to catch up with his intellect. Everyone should be allowed to stumble some, and hopefully correct themselves.  The fact that the situation was not cut and dry and that he was not simply shown as a genius while everyone around him was shown as an ass was the movie's heart and soul to me. Many of the secondary characters had flaws and imperfections too. Mark, however, is clearly operating on a different level than most people. His lack of social judgment and his growing pains seem a side effect of a mind preoccupied with larger technical issues. Better choices could have been made by him for sure and it seems whatever bad choices were not corrected, were certainly sorted out by the courts.<br /><br />I wonder if he still has the business card that says \\"I'm CEO...b*tch,\\" (which seemed somewhat intended towards his ex) or if he has had a new batch made up. Perhaps he will outgrow it and cringe at it someday like we all have done looking back on bad haircuts, funny clothing, bad moments, or poor choices. As the old saying goes, to make an omelet you have to break a few eggs. Mark broke a few along the way for sure, but oh, what an omelet he made.way for sure, but oh, what an omelet he made.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I hated it. I know there are lots of others out there who loved this book, but I hated it. I couldn't put it down & I hated it.<br /><br />I thought this would be a book like [[ASIN:159448385X A Thousand Splendid Suns]] - I struggled to read that brutal, beautiful book, but felt the redeeming feelings at the end made the journey worth it. \\"Hunger Games\\" was not like that for me.<br /><br />*spoiler alert*<br /><br />It is essentially a book about an enslaved nation governed by masters so unfeeling that they use children (12 to 18) in a yearly gladiator-type, fight-to-the-death contest as entertainment. Each year a boy & girl are chosen from each district to participate in the 'hunger games'. They are brought to the capital to be pampered, paraded, fed & ultimately judged on their ability to win. Sponsors are sought, wagers are placed & the children begin the fight for their lives. The masters, constantly watching the contest unfold, influence the outcome by sending silver parachutes to their favorites with needed medicine, supplies, food - as a reward for spicing up the drama or a thrilling kill.<br /><br />The whole thing is barbaric (which I'm sure is the point) and distasteful. I had hoped for a  paradigm shift or something to change the feeling of the book as it came to an end. It didn't happen. I was left with a dark, yucky feeling at the end. I don't plan on reading the other 2 in the series - I have no desire to spend my time hoping the next book ends better. I found nothing redeeming in cruelty for cruelty's sake - which is my take on the plot line. And I'm a little discouraged that so many have loved this book - what does that say about my fellow readers - or me?
B001C4AFOY|3.0|A visually impressive yet fragmented look at Queen Victoria's formative years. Running 105 minutes, one feels that \\"The Young Victoria\\" was pared down in the editing room. Still, there is much to enjoy - including Emily Blunt's exquisite performance and Sandy Powell's Oscar-winning costume design. Perhaps a director's cut will emerge.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|This is the same high quality LOST DVD package we have come to expect.  My one complaint is that with a universe as broad and expansive as LOST is, I feel the Special Features are a little on the sparse side.  The Prime example is \\"The New Man in Charge.  It started awesome, and I loved it, but when it was over, I had the same feeling I got when, back ini the day, I was watching an episode of LOST, and the TV went out.<br /><br />NOOOOOOOOOOO!
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|For some unknown reason, I decided to pre-order Clapton's latest release prior to sampling the tracks.  In this instance, that was a huge mistake.  As has been the case with his choice of material following the excellent 'Me and Mr. Johnson', Eric seems content displaying his best J.J. Cale impersonation with just a brief glimpse of his past blues/rock legacy.    Granted, at this point in his life, Clapton is under no obligation to reestablish his prowess as a guitarist.  But as far as I'm concerned, he's morphed into little more than a laid-back, where's-my-rocking-chair performer who is simply going through the motions, no longer challenging himself or his bandmates.    I cannot recall the last time I experienced such remorse after spending $10 on a product or meal that didn't deliver.  I'd have felt much better had I given that $10 to the homeless guy situated on the neighborhood street corner, asking for money while attired in a natty tuxedo.  I doubt this CD will ever see the light of day again, although I could probably send it to my ex-wife, who absolutely loves this \\"soft as marshmallows\\" crap.    By contrast, if you'd like to hear someone remain true to his roots and refuse to take the easy way out, give Ronnie Wood's new disc a listen to.  It was Ronnie, himself, who stated \\"I Feel Like Playing\\"; too bad Eric didn't.

B0009HKH6Q|5.0|Many reviewers have mentioned that, in all fairness, that they feel the Pierce Brosnan remake of this movie is just as good as Steve McQueen's original, if not better. Point taken, and ack, um, (me struggling to get the words out), they're right. The 1968 version is a little dated, the music is almost painful, and the Brosnan screenplay is definitely stronger. The acting in the latter version has to be noted, as well - Pierce Brosnan has that coolness, coldness and shrewdness that needs to be brought to the role of Tommy Crown, and had a different actor even attempted to re-do this movie, it could have been an eighty car pile-up. But Pierce, god love him, ain't McQueen, and that's why this version should be bought, downloaded, however you can get it (I bought the new transfer off of Amazon just this week). McQueen brings the actual belief to his role that not only would the character of Crown do something like hit a bank just for the thrill, but you can easily imagine Steve McQueen himself, offscreen, lighting a cigarette, saying, \\"Ah, the hell with it,\\" and doing the exact same thing, had the arms of Hollywood not reached out for him and given him all the material rewards he needed in his lifetime. Pierce...well, you never quite get past the feeling that his Thomas Crown, if it all came down to said and done, if it came down to that absolute moment of iciness, would say to Rene Russo (replacing Faye Dunaway from the original), \\"So, shall we see which one of us wins this thing?\\" Our man Steve would never let those words fleck from his lips; there's absolutely no doubt in his mind that he's gonna win, he's gonna get the lady and he's gonna spin dirt in everybody else's faces while he's doing it. Reviewing a movie with such a well-known plot is almost impossible, and I think that the best thing to do is to comment on the new transfer (much, much better than previous offerings, but still with an odd 'fuzzy' look and, here and there, murky sound to it that, despite this being made in the 1960s' does not seem to be intentional); the writing (again, the Brosnan version is more crisply written, but then, forty years later, the almost wordless chess scene between McQueen and Dunaway holds up, burns through the celluloid and needs no dialogue)and the original is interesting to watch for those 1968 cultural references, and character actors whom have slipped into some anonymity, unfortunately enough (remember the great Yapho Kotto?). When all is said and done, this is another Steve McQueen \\"Don't you wish you were this cool?\\" projects that, in fact, also offers good acting, able direction and production and a plot that does in fact get you to thinking about when is too much not enough, and what would you do to kickstart a stale morning? Oh, and those blue, blue eyes: Mercy, somebody bring me some water -being made in the 1960s' does not seem to be intentional); the writing (again, the Brosnan version is more crisply written, but then, forty years later, the almost wordless chess scene between McQueen and Dunaway holds up, burns through the celluloid and needs no dialogue)and the original is interesting to watch for those 1968 cultural references, and character actors whom have slipped into some anonymity, unfortunately enough (remember the great Yapho Kotto?).

B003YBNRHU|4.0|I was somehow curious on this \\"new\\" Doobie Brothers cd coming out. After some 35 years of music what next? Boy, I really tried, Cycle,Brotherhood,that other one we don't remember the name of.  I really gave these a good listen.With the new one,please order the deluxe package with the DVD in it. I wanted to see  first on the DVD on what direction this cd was going. So, I finally got it and sat down to listen to the whole thing. I was pleasantly surprised of the different variations of music. It seemed like a real refresh sound ,with that still \\"Doobies\\" sound like no other. But just seeing Pat,with gray hair(like we are not getting any younger). Even when I saw who played on the cd and saw Wilie Nelson, I said \\"man they have really gone off the deep end\\".  I must commend them for doing a fine job. Vocal harmonies were excellent. Guitar work by Tom & Pat still there. But again it was presented very nice. Even my friend that attended  NTSU with me ,Gregg Bisonette(drumer) played on two tunes. So give this band that has been literally pounding out hit after hit,a good listen to ,because it is good. My biggest  question that maybe another writer can answer is what really happened to Tiran Porter. I questioned the Doobie site and they said he was retired,end of sentence.... anyway buy it   its very surprising!

B0025KVLTC|5.0|There was about a 2 year period between 1965 and 1967 that 7 of the greatest rock/pop albums of all time were released:  3 by the Beatles, 3 by Dylan and 1 by The Beach Boys.  Rubber Soul, Revolver, Pepper, Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde and Pet Sounds are all critically acclaimed for different reasons, but they're among the great, must have albums in any serious collection.  There is some incredible music on this album.  Not everyone is a big fan of Harrison's 'Indian' songs, but they're adequate.  The rest of the songs are iconic and brilliant:  Taxman, Eleanor Rigby, She Said.., And Your Bird Can Sing, Here, There..., Got to Get You Into My Life, I'm Only Sleeping, Tomorrow Never Knows!   Long time Beatles fans have heard these songs a thousand times, but they're still brilliant.  If you have a rock music collection, this landmark album is mandatory.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I thought it was certainly one of the better movies I've seen this year. Everyone and everything in that movie shone. It started out with a 5-10 minute scene (I was too busy trying to keep up to really pay attention) between Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his then girlfriend Erica that caught my attention mainly by how focused (or in certain ways unfocused) it was and the lightning speed at which the two speak.<br /><br />From there the movie went everywhere and it is more dizzying than Inception was earlier this year. But that just makes it a better film, really. It's not that it takes from Inception, but rather, indeed, as many reviewers of the film have said, it plays awfully similar to Citizen Kane in terms of themes and story progression, among other things. While the movie may be set in its generation (already the film's closing line that Zuckerberg is currently the world's youngest billionaire is outdated; just a week or so ago he was said to be the second youngest via the Forbes 400) the story itself isn't. If you have seen Kane, you'll know the film is about a man involved in the newspaper industry and makes his living creating a media empire. Barely anyone in this generation reads the newspaper anymore but we know what it is still and thus the story still remains relevant. For more Kane similarities, consider that the film actually takes place after Kane has already died, the rest of the film taking place in flashbacks throughout his life. In very similar fashion, The Social Network depicts things as they happened in flashbacks told through the legal proceedings of the two ongoing lawsuits against Zuckerberg, after he has already alienated all of his closest friends.<br /><br />This is not a happy movie, though it is a detached one. Even if he is the central focus of the story, it never seems focused directly on Zuckerberg himself. When someone else is on the screen, your attention is drawn away from him and you focus on them instead. Such is the brilliance of film, though, and it is the very thing that pulls you into the movie. Zuckerberg is portrayed as an --- (I'll give you a hint here: it starts with an A and ends with a HOLE), as he is called in the film, and certainly you are intended to like him less and less. But he makes the stupid mistakes that anyone might make. You trust someone with something because you know them and what they're able to do for you (in the case of Sean Parker, played surprisingly well, might I add, by Justin Timberlake) and everything turns out going completely wrong.<br /><br />Whether or not there's exactly a single fact to be found in this film or not, it remains that this movie is a goldmine for those looking to get into business. The things it can teach you from showing someone else's experiences, true or false, at the same level of importance that the Godfather has a vast wealth of wisdom in it that many take to heart, despite being about organized groups engaging in criminal activity, ranging from simple fraud all the way up to murder.<br /><br />Agree with me or not, The Social Network is not only a movie for the time, but it is one of the best to come out since The Dark Knight wowed everyone just over two years ago and, as with myself, anyone who I've spoken with that has seen the movie has found themselves motivated to just do SOMETHING after seeing it.<br /><br />Watch this excellent Oscar contender ASAP.brilliance of film, though, and it is the very thing that pulls you into the movie.

Beautifully built, but the package is not usable and even though they were new when I got it, the dvds (1st and 2nd seansons) were damaged and full of scratches, which was a turn down.

B003ZK58WM|5.0|I have no problem paying the hardcover price and reading on a Kindle. Anyone who doesn't want to, doesn't have to buy it. I am just grateful that this title is available on Kindle at first release. Boycotters feel free to boycott; I am going to be reading happily. I haven't read it yet; my five stars is to offset all the one star reviews from people who hadn't read it -- and to give my opinion of Ken Follett's lifetime achievement of thoughtful entertaining page-turning novels.

1439148953|5.0|I thought it couldn't get any better after \\"The Master,\\" but Colm Toibin has outdone himself here with this moving tale of love and loss. Being an immigrant myself, I idenitifed immediately with Eilis, a quiet but determined young woman with a crucial decision to make. Toibin captures her conflicting emotions beautifully in this intimate and moving story.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I LOVE this book! I am 30% into Fall of Giants by Ken Follett and am truly transfixed with the lives of the characters. Currently they are swirling with the impending world war. What a ride! In fact, I believe I will love this book more than Pillars and World when I am done.     For the penny pinchers who are stomping their feet about price I suggest that they do the math. This book is 1,000 riveting pages of well-researched, beautifully captivating drama. Get it? 1,000 pages = $19.99. And, the average book is 330 pages = $9.99. You can buy 3 books for $30.00 at that price. If you must make it about dollars, you get MORE bang for your buck with this epic than the average novel.     I'm HAPPY to spend the money on books of this scale and caliber!
0316017922|4.0|Have you ever run across a book where just a small part made the purchase worthwhile? Even a good title can sometime work that way (though rarely), i.e., \\"Feel the Fear But Do It Anyway.\\" Usually we hope to get more from a book for our dollars than a short title, but the idea is there. For this reviewer, Malcolm Gladwell's chapter introducing the \\"10,000 hour rule\\" becomes one of those books where at least one thought sticks out. Summarizing the author's idea: it takes at least 10,000 hours of work and experience in a field to become expert at that field. The Beatles, for example, spend long weeks and hours flying to the Continent for gigs, before bursting onto the world's stage in 1963-64.     With a small amount of research one could probably find many, many instances where persons have put in those 10,000 hours or more, and still work in obscurity; assuming obscurity is an undesirable thing. On the other extreme hand, one will find folks who spent much less than those 10K hours and became famous anyway. The most popular example today would be Paris Hilton. This problem with the book's logic does not diminish the impact of the thought. Nor does it lessen the inspiration flowing from that. Readers who have spent years, decades, working and perfecting their own craft or profession will almost certainly feel greatly heartened by the \\"rightness\\" of that 10,000-hour rule. It is truly good to have pointed out that hard work, focus, and caring count, and have it stated so articulately.    Gladwell tells his stories well. This means that you, the reader, will like the book's flow. As with a couple of the author's bestsellers, his tales can sometimes leave one in doubt at to the exact point he aims at. This may not be huge problem, since \\"Outliers\\" presents its stories such that the logical gaps are easy to fill in. As a fine idea, the last chapter tells the author's own tale of immigration, hard work, good fortune, and a thank-you to the country where he found the opportunity to use his considerable talents. Buy the book.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|$19.99 for an E-book is outrageous!!  I have read most of Ken Follett's books and was looking forward to reading this one.  But I refuse to pay such a ridiculous price for an E-book.  I can't believe that others are willing to pay this.  Don't buy it!!!  Wait until the publisher gets the point and decreases the price to $9.99 or less.    And for those of you who keep stating that we should only be reviewing the book, not the price, I strongly disagree.  Whenever one reviews a product, value has to go into the equation.  The book we have all reviewed is a product which may get some positive points for content, but very negative points for price.
0307588335|1.0|I got this book to understand what the Lehman brothers did as a company and this author drove me insane with his stupid style of writing. For example he would quote his buddy using all these vulgar words which was not necessary to make a point.     Another thing that drove me crazy about this book is that it mentions many unimportant points that does not pertain to the Lehman story.     Why would we care if the author had \\"Chinese food to the left, printers to the right,...\\"?!!! This drove me insane!!     I'm on page 43 and I still don't know what Lehman brothers did. Some earlier reviewers mentioned this author took the opportunity to fill this book with his personal life which we DON'T care.     I wanted to read a book on the Lehman brothers, not on this author!

0439023513|3.0|Before I wrote this review, I wrote another. The other was, well, horrible. This one, I like much better. Also, my friend helped me write this one, so most of the time, the word 'we' is written. Now you know why. Enough about us, let's get on with the review. To start off, we'll say that we LOVED the first two books. We even both pre-ordered Mockingjay!!!!!!! But when we read it...that is a WHOLE other story. We were disappointed. Very disappointed. Why? Well...just read the rest of this review because it's way more interesting than this biography of an introduction.<br /><br />****SSSSSSSSSPPPPPPOOOOOOOOIIIILLLLLLLEEEERRRRRRSSSS*** SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!******************<br /><br />There are some who argue that this book is very realistic, but is Harry Potter waving a wand realistic? No. It's not. Yet it is an international bestseller, and you would be hard pressed to find someone absolutely hates it. This book, however, has many fans who have been upset by its blunt, and all too frank factor. This is science FICTION and YA. FICTION as in...you know...not real? We know that in real life, war does this to poeple. She gets that point across well enough. But, this being YA, the main character is supposed to rise out of whatever situation they are in, no matter how difficult.<br /><br />Now onto another thing that really messed this book: Prim. The whole reason that Katniss was in the Hunger Games in the first place. The whole reason that she risked her life, that this entire rebellion thing started. And Collins killed her off. Do you think Katniss would have volunteered if Dellie Cartright (whatever her name was) was reaped? I don't think so. So, basically, she killed the entire reason for her series. And not even very dramatically! I, for one, hardly even noticed that Prim died until she mentioned it (just mentioned, not told about how it happened when it actually happened, just mentioned)for the second or third time. And the reason Prim died, a reason we didn't even know about until Katniss said so, was so...stupid. I mean, what was Coin thinking? What did she say? \\"Hey little 12-year-old girl, why don't you go into that chaos and see if you can reassemble those blown-up kids?\\" Grrr. I (other person than before who said 'I, for one') actually had to reread it and CONCLUDE that Prim was dead.<br /><br />And there's another thing that starts with P that really got to me. Can you guess what it is? Caaaaaaaaaaaaannnn you? You have 10 seconds...10...9...8...7...okay it was Peeta. WHERE WAS HE? His personality disappeared. He was no longer the affectionate, kind-hearted person that we know. Yes, he was hijacked, and no, he woudn't be the same, but really... He never really felt the same after that. He was 'told' that he loved Katniss so he...what? Loved Katniss? It just doesn't seem right. It doesn't seem true or real (Real or not real?? I have no idea. But that was indeed the best part of Peeta. It actually showed his character!) But the whole hijacking thing was good. And it would have been even BETTER if Katniss actually CARED. She just basically gets offended because Peeta (who is not himself - who is sick and tortured with horrible messed up memories - and she knows this!) says something that he doesn't know is wrong. Don't you think she should have at least TRIED to get him back, to make him see that she really wasn't out to kill hem, that she wasn't a mutt? I thought that she was stronger tha0000000n that. But maybe I was wrong.<br /><br />Ooooohhhh...and about Katniss being strong...I didn't feel that sense of POWER she had in the first 2 books. I mean sure, first time she cried in a closet I was like \\"okay, okay, heroines can break down sometimes...\\" until she was in hospital after hospital after hospital AFTER HOSPITAL. And hiding in closets, wasting her life away. Yes, she knew 13 was trying to use her, but don't you think she would ahve wanted to actually go out and DO something about this mess everyone was in? Yeah, she went out and hunted with Gale. That was actually a pretty nice part of the book. It was 'old Katniss.' The one who would demand to be let out to hunt... the one thing that she is herself doing.<br /><br />GALE! HE IS ANOTHER THING! In this book, he has absolutely NO RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE! All those traps... yes, he is a hunter, but not of poeple. He's the kind of guy who is strong for his family, and will do anything to protect them.

That was actually a pretty nice part of the book. It was 'old Katniss.' The one who would demand to be let out to hunt... the one thing that she is herself doing.    GALE! HE IS ANOTHER THING!

B0034G4P7G|5.0|The Social Network seemed to have all the right pieces put together for an outstanding film. With David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en) directing and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor  working on the score for the film, it was intriguing the moment it was announced. On the other hand though, it was a film revolving around Facebook. How was that going to work and would something most of use on a daily basis be able to be stretched out into a premise that holds our attention span for roughly two hours? It actually managed to do just that and then some.<br /><br />The film's powerful script shows its strength from the opening scene. While The Social Network is purely dialogue driven the entire film, it's still incredibly engaging. You get absorbed into the film pretty easily. The main cast is pretty flawless, as well. Jesse Eisenberg may be considered to most as a more serious version of Michael Cera, but that really isn't such a bad thing. His seriousness, quick wit, and intelligence are what drive this film. Even Justin Timberlake steals a few scenes as the rather eccentric entrepreneur that used to own Napster. However, Andrew Garfield seems to be the guy that's really coming into his own. With a film like this under his belt and how impressive his performance was, many of the doubts about him being the next Spider-Man will be put to rest. Add on top of all this David Fincher's ability to not only help put together a fantastic film, but make it look visually appealing as well and you have one of the strongest and most well-rounded out films of the year.<br /><br />The score is just as fantastic as any NIN or Trent Reznor fan could have hoped. While you could certainly hear Reznor's industrial contributions, that's probably its biggest asset as it helps this score be distinguished from every other movie score out there. It seems like most films since The Dark Knight have all had scores that sounded similar to Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's Grammy winning score. While The Social Network's score shares that same dark, ambitious, and sometimes ominous tone, it's Reznor's industrial roots that makes the music to the film unique.<br /><br />There was one aspect of the film that was kind of interesting. If anyone else reading this watches South Park, in the latest season they did an episode revolving around Facebook entitled \\"You Have 0 Friends\\" that also parodied the film Tron. In that episode, Wendy approaches Stan and asks him if he thinks she is stupid because he has his relationship status on Facebook set as \\"Single.\\" So why is this being mentioned now? This conversation seems like it was nearly lifted verbatim from the South Park episode and put into The Social Network. They are very similar. If you don't watch South Park, it probably won't be much of an issue. But if you do, it's pretty hilarious.<br /><br />The Social Network is a captivating drama that also offers quite a bit of laughs. Its excellent writing, top notch cast, and superb directing make the film nearly flawless in its execution. The film has the potential to not only make a massive gross at the box office, but also become the film of this generation since everything seems to revolve around social networking these days. If you enjoy explosions, blood and guts, or pulse racing action, then this film probably isn't for you. This will more than likely come off a bit long winded to fans of those types of films. However, this comes highly recommended to those who enjoy intriguing dialogue in their movies that's intertwined with outstanding storytelling. Come award season, this is definitely a front runner.al Network's score shares that same dark, ambitious, and sometimes ominous tone, it's Reznor's industrial roots that makes the music to the film unique.

B003EYVXUK|4.0|Let the Right One In  was one of the most talked about films of 2008. Even outside the horror community, critics and moviegoers alike were raving how the film breathed new life into the tired vampire genre. While the Swedish film certainly had its moments and told a pretty amazing story, it wasn't quite as exceptional as everyone made it out to be. When word came that Cloverfield director Matt Reeves  would be remaking the film for American audiences, there was a massive amount of skepticism. You've probably heard the complaints about remakes before. How they're never as good as the original and are only done to make a quick buck. Well Hollywood may have pulled a fast one on you and is set to release a remake that's actually worth seeing for once.<br /><br />The trickiest part when handling a remake like this is what the writers, directors, and anyone else behind the scenes decide to change in comparison to the original film. If they change too much then people complain that it strayed too far from the original, but if they change too little then people claim it's too similar to the original and that it was pointless to remake in the first place. They've got to find a balance; add just the right amount of different and new material while maintaining a film that follows in the same footsteps of whatever it was based on. Let Me In just does that.<br /><br />Let Me In is actually at its strongest during the scenes where it ventures away from the 2008 film. Just about any scene that takes place in a car is spectacular, especially during one particular scene where things don't go exactly as planned. There's also a scene where Abby attacks a jogger in a tunnel that's pretty brutal. These added scenes didn't take anything away from the already well-established story, but actually managed to add depth to these characters a good portion of the people seeing this are already familiar with. Considering most Hollywood remakes, this is well worth mentioning. Let Me In at least deserves credit for pulling off something like that.<br /><br />There are several alterations to the story that may put off some who were Let the Right One In enthusiasts. Oskar and Eli are now Owen and Abby and the film now takes place in New Mexico rather than Stockholm. Some of the more memorable scenes in the film didn't make quite as much of an impact as they did in Let the Right One In. Virginia being exposed to sunlight and the pool scene at the end of the film being the two biggest examples. It's not that those particular scenes weren't done well, but they just felt too similar or maybe weren't quite different enough to distinguish them in comparison to the original. That's probably my biggest complaint with the film overall. If you've seen Let the Right One In, then you know how everything turns out. That's a pretty obvious statement dealing with a remake, but knowing that going in really seemed to hurt the experience overall.<br /><br />Let Me In definitely deserves to be held in high regard as one of the best horror remakes in recent years and perhaps ever. Its newly added material blends in nicely into an already well-written vampire story. It just felt like the film could have been even stronger if it was a bit more unpredictable. Nevertheless, its wonderful cast, enticing storyline, and eye-catching camera work will satisfy just about any moviegoer and is a surprisingly strong horror film to be released this late in the year.or pulling off something like that.

0525951652|1.0|I join the Kindle owners' boycott of this book! No reduced price for an electronic, environmentally friendly copy is not only unfair but also harmful to the environment.  This is classic \\"bait-and-switch\\" (or rather \\"bait then gouge\\"): we are baited into buying a Kindle in the belief that we will be charged reasonable prices and will be making a contribution to a cleaner environment only to have that switched to price gouging after we commit.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|These two lead actors really spoiled the story for me. Instead of clever reparte, they mope, pout and stay sullen.  Their mood is constantly serious, even truly depressing.  Jane Austen wrote clever dialogue, and if you watch the previous versions with Colin Firth, and the best version with Greer Garson, you will see what's missing from this version.  The PRIDE is missing, the provocative bantering and the little digs.  Do yourself a favor and skip this version, and watch Greer instead.

B003J27WFW|5.0|For anyone that thought they knew Rush music, knew they were one of Canada's biggest prog rock bands and thought they were just like many other bands out there.....well, it's time that you learn the real story of Rush. This disc not only starts at the beginning, it brings you right up to date.  This band went through a major transformation after their first hit single \\"Working Man\\" was receiving radio air time and as we all usually say, the rest is history.  Well, that's true to a point with this band.  They began writing their 20 minute songs, bucking the record companies and gathering thousands of fans along the way.  Their story is amazing and after watching this documentary, you will have no choice but to start listening to the old albums again (and again).  This will wake up the Rush fan that's been hibernating inside of you all of these years.  Enjoy.....
B0007939NO|5.0|Brigadoon is one of my favorites. I love the music and especially the story line, the idea of a perfect place where things never change and of finding what is really important in life. Of course it's a musical so they sing and dance all over the place, and the last time we watched it we were still singing the songs a week later. If you like musicals this is a good choice and you can't go wrong with Gene Kelly or Cyd Charisse.
B002ZG9968|3.0|I am going to be short and to the point.  This movie had a lot of potential and a good storyline that was different from most. I realize that it is a romantic comedy with slapstick ways which produced a few crude but hilarious moments.  However, as a \\"romantic comedy\\" there were raucus moments that in my opinion were too disgusting for the genre.  The whole single mother's club giving birth to a baby in the pool scene was almost enough for me to stop watching the movie.  It was that disgusting! What were the writers thinking?  They went way overboard, thus ruining an otherwise good but different concept of a movie.  IMHO
B003SWNRU2|5.0|the reviewer who said \\"back with a vengeance\\" nailed it. I've been an Accept fan for at least 25 years and they are one of<br />my favorite metal bands because they write great songs with killer riffs. And they deliver those songs with conviction.<br />New vocalist Mark Tornillo fits right in. When this band is on they take a backseat to no one. I recently saw them at<br />BB King's in New York and they blew the doors off the place. Photos here-<br />[...]
B001FB5634|4.0|WATCH THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />As a huge fan of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name [[ASIN:B003WSKS9U [The Road]]], I was very excited about seeing this movie!<br /><br />The movie experience is not nearly as gripping as the book in my opinion, but let me explain -<br /><br />1. If you read the book first, you will not enjoy the movie as much. Why you ask, because you already know all the surprises, you already know what's coming next. Whereas when you read the book, you were blown away everytime something so unimaginable happened, that you couldnt believe it.<br /><br />2. If you haven't read the book, you will enjoy the movie if your prepared for what for about to see. The movie doesn't have alot of dialogue, it has basically no color. It's not black and white, but its very bleak and grim in the world of \\"The Road\\" and its not very pleasant.<br /><br />Alot of people that have seen this movie loved it, for its originality and for Viggo Mortensen's acting. The man is amazing, he really gets into this role and nails it.<br /><br />This movie will surprise you and its one of those movies you don't want to have missed when everyone is talking about it.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"The Road\\", you may like these other apocalyptic films - [[ASIN:B002TZS5GU Carriers]], [[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]], [[ASIN:B002ZG997M The Book of Eli]]!<br /><br />Enjoy~
0393072231|5.0|First, back in the 80's I sold mortgages that were a better version of those discussed in the book. That is, no-doc, negative amortization (interest only, pick your payment), adjustable rate loans.  I worked in PA for a NY bank. Our no-docs were generally good, however in NYC and environs the loan officers went crazy, as you would expect. After a while, a high default rate appeared (around 3%, things were tighter then) the bank couldn't get any more money to lend and the its mortgage lending operation all but ceased.  During the frenzy, however, the bank's assets tripled or quadrupled, the bank's stock price shot up, and its president and other stockholders made a bundle. Sound familiar?    So I can tell you that book is accurate. I can also tell you a few things about these loans: First, the loan officers decide who get them and the loan officers work on commission. Second, everybody knows this.  So it is not true that no one knew what was going on, nor is that what Lewis says in his book; what he says is that the top executives did not know what the bond traders were doing. The book, especially the discussion of the ratings agencies, makes clear that the people putting together the bonds and the CDOs based on them had to know what they were doing.  let me stress this: the bonds were bad and the CDO's based on them were worse, they were worthless from the outset.  Lewis does indicate that a lot of people on wall street did not know what the CDOs were, which is indeed possible, because they were derivatives of derivatives of derivatives, or, basically, so abstracted as to be nothing.    Second thing about these loans is that they are not \\"poor people's loans.\\"  They are made for people with highly fluctuating, unreported, or illegitimate income. Loan officers do not want to chase after poor people because the houses they buy are cheap, the mortgages low, and the typical commission at 35 to 50 basis points is not worth the time. So to motivate them to lend to the poor their managers have to have told them that large batches of the loans could be handled at a time **and that the default rates didn't matter.**  What that means is that the managers had to have been told, by the owners or top execs of the mortgage companies - who had been told, in turn, by wall street firms - that the loans would be chopped into pieces and the pieces buried in a sucession of bonds, so that default rates wouldn't matter.      Lewis shows this happening, shows the excitement as the opinion spread that default rates wouldn't matter, people screaming, get me more loans!  His story follows people who realized that, despite the opinions of all the mathematicians and computer modelers that wall street hired, default rates did matter.      What he describes is clearly fraud. He steps back from that, depending on the fact that the wall street bandits themselves underwrote tons of credit default swaps - before realizing that the whole thing was going to go bad and selling them to the likes of AIG and some german banks. This was another very clear instance of fraud, but, perhaps thinking of lawsuits, indicates its fraudulence while stating that the original underwriting of the insurance policies shows that wall street did not understand the toxicity of its the bonds and the spun off CDOs.           So while this is just a guess, it seems to me that the book is a dance designed to show criminal activity while not saying it is criminal. Perhaps because Lewis knows (a) that these people are too big to be prosecuted and (b) failing the government proving fraudulent activity, he is open to slap suits that could bankrupt him.    As others have said, Lewis is an excellent writer, the book compulsively readable (except perhaps in the passages explaining CDOs, which Lewis, as I think everyone in the universe, seems to have trouble understanding.      Here's a very rough model: You have the mortgage loans. The mortgages go into a huge pool, perhaps put into a bond.  That pool or bond is sliced up, so that there are no longer any individual mortgages (ie the underlying assets no longer exist) and out of those slices another bond is created, a derivative. And sold.  After a short while, it is discovered that you can further dilute and resell this mess by hauling out a mathematical model and doing a re-slicing of the pre-sliced slop. So this time you slice up the derivatives you have just created and put those slices into another thing, derivative of derivatives,a true monster from grave robbed-parts, and call it a Collateralized Debt Obligation, or CDO.      The problem from the start is: What collateral? The answer: either zero or ten-twenty cents on the dollar.  The problem with the derivatives is that the whole is weaker than the sum of its parts - if the fraudsters didn't know it from jump street, they were willfully blind.  They ought to be doing time in a state penitentiary.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Demons possessed them creating the perfect heavy metal album. How else to explain Screaming for Vengeance?<br /><br />More than once, reporters have asked members of Judas Priest if 'Electric Eye' is the best song they've written. Priest don't fess up to it, but they don't deny it either. Quite often they play this as their opening song at concerts. On their 'Rising in the East' DVD they play 'Metal Gods' after 'Electric Eye'. Both songs have a similar theme, if you think about it. Judas Priest often close their concerts with 'You Got Another Thing Coming\\", also on this CD.<br /><br />Electric Eye may be the best song they've written (it's likely one of their better ones) but I may like 'Take (these chains)' on here better. This is supposedly a cover or song-writers song. This was it's first release I believe. After Priest's cover of Green Manilishi and Diamonds and Rust there's a bit of mystery or even humor surrounding this song. Is it a country western song? It's certainly titled as if it is, Take (these chains). One verse ends with the lyric \\"world war three\\". It would make just as much sense as, \\"poor, poor, me\\". Never mind, that's what he actually sings. The mystery deepens.<br /><br />That's all I have to say about that.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I join in with all the other reviewers in protesting the price of this ebook.  No way in hell I will pay that price.....so the author will lose out.

B00005K9LM|3.0|I remember when Rolling Stone magazine, who never had a good thing to say about Ozzy Osbourne, reviewed his album 'No Rest for the Wicked', calling it a \\"parody of an Ozzy album\\". Which is weird because that's exactly what 'No Rest for the Wicked' was. At last, an accurate review. Defenders of the Faith verges on being a parody album. It's metal and nothing but metal. Metal with no rhyme or reason. People outside the world of metal were laughing at this one. It didn't take this album for them to laugh at metal music, but many of them laughed at this album in particular. I guess if the songs for your new album aren't that good, play 'em harder. If you're Judas Priest, faster too.<br /><br />The spoof band Spinal Tap performed a song called 'Heavy Duty' in their humorous movie 'This is Spinal Tap'. The song is an obvious parody of 'Heavy Duty' on here. Both the film and Defenders of the Faith were released in 1984. As a final joke the parody song may have been released before the real thing.<br /><br />'Eat Me Alive' is noteworthy for containing lyrics that were discussed before congress in hearings which led to parental advisory stickers placed on subsequent albums (of all kinds). The lyric read was, \\"I'm going to force you at gun point to eat me alive\\". The controversy didn't follow the band closely, if barely at all. When questioned about it in an interview later the band suggest warning advisories were probably a good idea but they show disdain for censorship. About the lyric itself they suggest it was meant to be humorous. They don't seem to take the issue seriously as they finish up that part of their interview.<br /><br />My favorite song on Defender's is probably 'Rock Hard, Ride Free'. 'The Sentinel' kept up the interest of fans (maybe just guitar players) a few years after the albums release. The Sentinel reminds me (in theme) of the song 'Vengeance (the pact)' by the band Blue Oyster Cult. Listening to the song again, are there a few places on 'The Sentinel' where Rob gives less than his best singing effort?<br /><br />When the song Love Bites begins there are some sound effects reminiscent of sound effects at the beginning of Michael Jackson's heavy metal song 'Beat It' on his Thriller album. Others seem to borrow from Defenders. A couple of years later Whitney Houston sings \\"when the night falls, my lonely heart calls\\" a bit similar to 'Night Comes Down'. Speaking of which, surely 'Night Comes Down' was intended as something close to irony? There's a video of Night Comes Down on YouTube. It's done in 'shaky cam'. When the song begins Rob Halford introduces it by saying, \\"we'll give you something, something, deep, when the night comes down\\". I noticed right away his use of the word 'deep'. It wasn't till watching the video many times I noticed all he says. As the introduction he says, \\"to slow things down a little a tiny bit, we'll give you something, something, deep, when the night comes down\\". Why not?<br /><br />The whole album is not as good as Night Comes Down, and there's no two and one half star button. Two stars are certainly tempting me. . .han his best singing effort?

I soon started to think I could use the different bouquets as a centerpiece for my table (the bouquets and big enough to work in the center of a table or even on a side table). I decided to buy 3 more as Christmas gifts. This also makes a great gift because their is truly nothing like it out there and I know the receivers will be as pleasantly surprised as I was.

0500543933|5.0|Street Photography Now provides terrific insights into the minds of 46 street photographers from around the world.  In form, it is a coffee table book, but that term is far too limiting.    Each photographer receives about 4 or 5 pages of coverage.  Many of the photographs exhibit great humor.  Some of the photographs exhibit clear signs of pre-visualization, so if you've heard the terms but don't quite get it, you might get some guidance through the examples offered here.    The short essay that accompanies each photographer's work provides insights into the photographer's aesthetics--why they do it and what they are trying to accomplish.  There also are several longer essays scattered throughout the book.  The book is obviously not intended as a \\"how to\\" manual, but anyone who roams the streets looking for photo opportunities will find some ideas to experiment with.    As far as quality, the color reproduction and printing are excellent, as is the layout.  A lot of thought and planning went into assembling this book.  In short, this book is a must for any street photographer or anyone else who enjoys the aesthetics of street photography.    I may have to wait a long-time, but I hope the authors consider doing a second volume.  Better yet would be an annual survey, as in Street Photography 2011.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Not a day passes that we don't hear about the problems with privacy on Facebook. However, based on The Social Network, lawsuits from users are petty when complained to the other issues Facebook has had to go through. As it has been proven by the success and diminishing influence of services such as MySpace, with a social networking service, the goal is not to become but remain dominant.<br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg is the co-founder of Facebook and the youngest billionaire, and a complete Nerd. There is nothing anti-social about Zuckerberg, but there is not a shred of sociability about him, either. He is driven by a mad passion for success. His life centers around Facebook, and anything or anyone that gets in way of his success must be eliminated. Just as the poster of the film indicates, with the countless fans, admirers, and Facebook \\"friends\\" Zuckerberg has collected, he also has gathered a few enemies-mostly combined of his previous acquaintances and friends.<br /><br />As the events leading up to the creation and prominence of Facebook are told, Zuckerberg, cofounder Eduardo Saverin and the founders of the Harvard website ConnectU are sitting in a compact space, engaged in a bitter legal fight. This backdrop of the film has a courtroom drama feel to it, but composed only of defendant and plaintiff and their respective lawyers. It has the jolting electricity of a very important case, but allowing much time for snippy comeback and offhand comments. These scenes compose Zuckerberg's personality brilliantly. With a pen in his hand, he is doodling in a notebook, seemingly unaware that he could potentially lose a large portion of his money to these men. Then again, the success of Facebook is behind Zuckerberg ability to give up large sums of money to ensure his empire grows. This billionaire plays his cards well, and understands the futility of a few million dollars in comparison to reduced traffic, which could be the result of user's disgust with ads. To others, the success of Facebook lies within the money that can be collected, yet Zuckerberg believes Facebook's longevity and continued dominance within the domain of social networks is more precious than any monetary deal.<br /><br />David Fincher has done something with the story of Facebook that can only be described as monumental. It begins with the development of Facebook, its success, and the effect it places on the lives of the cofounders. However, Fincher succeeds at morphing the film into a product that does not overindulgently explore and scrutinize these people's lives. His film explores the idea of creative plagiarism, the unwillingness of school authorities to investigate the complaints, the Harvard School life, and the paths individuals partake to guarantee the success of their ventures. Fincher brilliantly touches on the issues, but not allowing any of these elements overwhelm the main story line. In reality, The Social Network eventually morphs in to a successful film detailing the ambition, passion, and drive of genius in general. This is what elevates the film from ordinary \\"drama.\\" It paints a world about the development of the most famous internet social service, and turns the story on its head, establishing the wild passion that all artists have for their projects. Zuckerberg may seem aloof, but his passion for Facebook makes everything else in his life, from academic probation and loss of friendship, seem relatively unimportant or even sometimes futile.<br /><br />The Social Network deserves an Oscar Nod for Best Adapted Screenplay, as Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is magnificent in the scope and depth of issues it discusses. The screenplay may seem stiff in its study of success of business ventures, but the dialogue rings true. When Sean Parker, portrayed by Justin Timberlake, advises Mark, Napster's co-founder seems to be giving viable information about the key to success. The dialogue is very sharp, funny, and theater-like in delivery, and sometimes even seems improvisational. Jesse Eisenberg deserves credit for his grand performance, but most surprising is Justin Timberlake's presence. He does not come across as a wannabe actor, such as Hillary Duff or Brittany Spears. He is great as the confident entrepreneur that we forget this is the same man who ruled the Pop World with N'Sync and \\"Bring Sexy Back.\\"<br /><br />Quite remarkably, the film offers no villain or kind soul in the film, yet Fincher paints every character with some fault. Zuckerberg, for example, is so overly ambitious that he has lost touch with his emotions-never becoming overjoyed by his success. Even Eduardo, who suffers emotional and financial loss because of Facebook, and the most likeable character, is at fault for freezing the company's bank account and possibly damaging the Facebook's reputation and stability. Mark Zuckerberg may be the eventual winner in the struggle for power, but that is because he knew his priorities and limits and stuck to them; and did not waver.<br /><br />Mark Zuckerberg has claimed that this film, and the novel it was based, is more a work of fiction than fact. However true that may be, we must remember that film is supposed to be enlightening, and often entertaining. The truth may be that these men sat in their dorms writing up code day after day, but that would create a dull and unimaginative film. Film can mimic reality, but it not necessarily must do so. Zuckerberg will find an affectionate, if not realistic, portrait of himself, which shows him as the true backbone of Facebook. It may not be a flattering portrayal, but it never becomes condescending or disrespectful. This film has been compared to Citizen Kane, one of the hallmarks of Cinema. Though an unfair comparison, both films are based on fascinatingly demanding and powerful individuals who are moguls in their own ventures. Even if Facebook is forgotten in a decade, this film will still be a relevant portrayal of ambition and passion of a man who stopped at nothing to reach his goal.e Eisenberg deserves credit for his grand performance, but most surprising is Justin Timberlake's presence.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|Right after their second album and Demon Days concert at the Apollo Theater (which I attended on the first day...it was a blast!) they silently disappear in the music scene. During those moments, I slowly lost interest in Gorillaz and I've moved on listening to new music and so on. Couple of years later, I hear that Gorillaz are coming back with a new album entitled \\"Plastic Beach\\". Originally, I wasn't expecting much but right after I heard a few demos they released last year, my anticipation grew and  I began checking up on what the group were up to. Then after a year, they finally release their third album. Was it worth the wait? Did the sequel stand up against its second installment? I purchased the album on day one and jumped into the experience!    I'm going to give a review on each track, let's get started:    Orchestral Intro- A very nice orchestral piece, not much to say about it. 8/10    Welcome To The World Of The Plastic Beach- I really like the chill vibe and beat throughout the song. Snoop Dog gives a pretty good performance but I will agree that his lyrics aren't that amazing. I really enjoy listening to the synths, bass, brass and Damons vocals \\"just like that\\" being played throughout the track, it all flows very well. Overall it's a nice intro and catchy song that's simple, short and straight to the point. 8.5/10    White Flag- I remember the short preview of an Arabian orchestral tune being played on Murdoc's pirate radio show awhile back. I really did enjoy that preview since it showed the new direction Gorillaz was heading off to. When the whole track was released on youtube, I didn't know what to expect. When I heard the entire thing, I was completley blown away. Once the beat dropped after the orchestral piece, it felt like a full blast of energy just came out of my speakers. Yes, it was that epic. Kano and Bashy's lines are great and the end with the electro beat and the orchestra fusing together is pretty badass. Probably one of my favorite Gorillaz tracks on this album. 10/10    Rhinestone Eyes- The first song that features Damon's vocals. At first, I wasn't too fond of this track but listening to a couple of times more it made me appreciate it more. At this moment, I'm in love with the track. The lyrics and the synths sound orgasmic throughout the track and it's catchy as hell! My favorite part would have to be when Damon screams out \\"Here we go again!\\". 9/10    Stylo- This one takes me back, hearing the leaked version before the official release made my day. There's a divided opinion of stylo between Gorillaz fans, some hate it and some love it. Me personally, I think it's a very great track and a good choice for a single. It's a shame that it didn't do too well in the charts. Anyway, first hearing it was pretty interesting. Hearing Bobby Womacks powerful vocals behind a cold electric sound gives the track a very incredible style in my opinion. Mos Def also tops the song with a little rap verse he repeats in the song. I also dig 80's sound with the layered scratching electric sounds. 9/10    Superfast Jellyfish- A very nice song to listen to. This track reminds me of those old breakfast cereal commercials that have a sugary sweet song accompanied with it. De La Soul come back one again  as they rap about how we're all going to eat jellyfish as food at one point. The chorus \\"Superfast, Superfast, I come in last, but just in time for breakfast\\" is really catchy as well. I'm kinda disappointed that this hasn't been officially released as a single. 9/10    Empire Ants- Incredible, just incredible. The strumming of the acoustic guitar, the scratchy/soft beat, the echoes of the piano and damons heavenly vocals and lyrics are just fantastic. Not only that, the transaction to an explosive eighties inspired synth pop is just genius, little Dragon killed it (in a extremely good way). Best Gorillaz song for sure. 10/10    Glitter Freeze- A mostly instrumental track that I really dig since first listen. The songhas a very atmospheric eletronic sound accompanied with repetitive but memorable hooks. Hearing Mark E. Smith's part is probably one of the coolest parts of the track. Glitter Freeze being played live is even better! 8.5/10    Some Kind of Nature- Lou Reed preformance and his mono-tone vocals in this track are sweet! The song flows really well when both damon and lou reed vocals are played together. I think the theme of the lyrics are pretty neat as well. Did I mention that it also had an amazingly catchy beat? 8.5/10    On Melancholy Hill- Talk about going back in time! One of the most straightforward pop songs in the record delivers a very 80's sounding synth pop accompanied with very charming lyrics. This one is probably one of my favorites in the record. Beautiful stuff! 9/10    Broken: A dark but upbeat track sung by Damon. My opinion usually changes when I listen to this song, at one point it's a really good song and another day it's alright but at this exact moment, I'm really into it. It all depends in the the mood I'm in. My favorite part of the song would probably be the chorus when the acoustic and the scratchy beat come in, probably one of the coolest parts in the track. The changes to the lyrics aren't bad at all either. 8/10    Sweepstakes- I'm just gonna copy Zedzilla's comments (a member from a gorillaz forum) since I have the same views as him: \\"Sweepstakes has the most intricate melody lines of any Gorillaz song. The organ grinder sounding synth, the brass ensemble's parts, even the punchy 3/4 hand drum sounding thing all have a unique melody line. The parts come crashing together to make what is probably the most audacious sounding melody Gorillaz have in their repertoire.\\" 10/10      Plastic Beach- This song goes perfectly well right after listening to sweepstakes. The guitar intro played by Paul and Mick is very epic and sounds like something I would expect from a western film. The collaboration itself is pretty short and pointless but that doesn't make the song any worse, it's in fact one catchiest songs and one of my faves in plastic beach in my opinion. Damon's vocals and spiraling keyboard line just blend perfectly well. Great track! 9.5/10    To Binge- Not to sound corny or anything but this song literally took my heart away. The dreamy/mellow Hawaiian sound, Damon's and Yukimi's vocal delivery and the lyrics are just amazing. I could write an essay of how much I love this song but I'm just gonna keep it real short. Best collaboration and best song on the album. 10/10    Cloud of Unknowing- Just right after listening to a beautiful heartwarming song, this one hits the heart again. Bobby Womack's delivery in this song is so strong and very emotional. The atmospheric instrumentation from Sinfonia ViVA makes the song even more incredible. It feels like I'm actually diving into deep sea oceans. Hearing this with the official visuals is even better. I would also like to point out that in the end when Bobby is humming in the background of the track (around 2:38) is just amazing. 10/10    Pirate Jet- The last track on the album. When I listen to this, I imagine people who are in Plastic Beach are finally leaving the place. As they leave the plastic kingdom, an image of the future pops into their head, knowing that the place will continuously grow and that the flow of plastic will continue for years to come. The song itself is short but delivers a good message and overall sounds very good. The fading in the end  of the song makes me wonder if this is the final stage in the Gorillaz trilogy or that \\"maybe\\" they will return one day...who knows? This song makes you wonder...good way to end an album. 9/10                  So in short..    Plastic Beach is a musical concept that I was expecting Damon to do for years. I wanted him to go for a more experimental approach and do something different with this project. The album to me had a more diverse sound and a nice mix of genres which makes it one of their most varied Gorillaz album yet. It maintains a more apparent theme than Demon Days, which keeps the album more consistent. This album may not have singles like FGI and/or CE but it's been rewarded with songs like Empire Ants, Stylo, Sweepstakes, White Flag, To Binge, etc.    Final Verdict:  Plastic Beach- 4.5/5    *I've decided to choose 5 stars for this review since there is no way to give 4.5 stars.*
B001UV4XX8|2.0|Well there have been countless so-called reviews that are actually a detailed synopsis with a review tacked on, so I won't bother reciting the storyline all over again and ruining the movie for those who haven't watched it.  All I can say is that this movie is totally and utterly incoherent.  The two main characters are compelling and it keeps your attention, seemingly dangling the promise of a big payoff at the end if you just keep watching, but the payoff never comes and you're just left with dozens of plot holes and feeling disappointed, as if you must have missed something.  It goes off countless different directions that are just blind alleys and contribute nothing whatsoever to the story or solving the mystery of what's going on.<br /><br />After I watched this movie I got the distinct impression it was one of those movies where the writer and/or director MIGHT have had a coherent vision initially, but whoever did the editing had no clue what that vision was and didn't read the screen play, so they just pieced the movie together as best they could from all the footage without any input whatsoever from the director.  You can imagine what the likely result would be of such an attempt and it isn't good.  Either that, or it's almost as if you had multiple writers who had read the original short story (which this is based on), but rather than collaborating they each wrote their own screenplay, and then someone selected scene 1 from one writer, scene 2 from another writer, and so on and so forth until they reached the end of the story.  Again, imagine what the result would be of such a thing and you can well imagine how disjointed this movie was.<br /><br />The central characters all give decent performances, and the soundtrack helps set the mood and generate empathy for the two main characters, but it's nowhere near enough to make up for such a poorly written and/or edited movie.  I actually watched it at least a few times since it's been on the movie channels the last couple months, in the hopes that I missed critical details the first time or two that I watched it.  I did in fact pick up on things every time watched it that I missed the previous times, but none of it helped to make the movie any more coherent.  My advice is to skip this movie or you might seriously regret that you needlessly forfeited 2 hours of your life.months, in the hopes that I missed critical details the first time or two that I watched it.

0385341008|5.0|This book is just a wonderful read. Though at first I was weary of the letter format, I fell into the story with ease. I enjoyed seeing the correspondences and the different perspectives that the letters allowed.<br /><br />I also found the history of the story intriguing. I had never heard of the island of Guernsey, and I feel like it's story needed to be told. The author did a wonderful job doing so. The light but sincere romance was refreshing, even if some may feel it was predictable. As for myself, I enjoyed watching the main character, Juliet, develop meaningful relationships with the people on the island and help them tell their story.
B003XUKVXK|5.0|This CD smokes - no doubt! Kenny is truly one of the greats, and it's about time he put out a live album. I saw hime live twice, and there's no comparing the live experience to album play. My complaint is that it has been years since he has recorded new music. It's nice to listen to his older material on this CD, but I want some new music! Joe Bonamassa and Joe Satriani put out great Cd's almost every year. I know Kenny can't be running out of his creative juices yet!

0316098337|5.0|This happy, sad, scary story is experienced through the eyes and words of five year old Jack. The child-perspective created by the author is entirely believable. Jack was born in Room and he's content to be there with Ma, whose desperate plight is obliquely obvious only to the reader. The morning of his fifth birthday Jack doesn't know (yet) that his mother was kidnapped from her college campus and imprisoned in Room seven years ago by Old Nick who comes at night - sometimes. That's why Jack sleeps in Wardrobe instead of on Bed with Ma.    The first few pages move the reader slowly thorough an ordinary day in Room; which is just odd enough to be interesting. About the time you start wondering if anything different is going to happen - it does. Ma's last-hope plan B expands (at warp-speed) Jack's two-person reality to include a whole world - all of \\"outer space\\" that he thought existed only in the small TV that Ma let him watch an hour or so a day. And let me tell you, that's a lot for a little guy to handle! But handle it he does in his own five-year-old way.    Wonderful story telling by Emma Donohue! I loved the book.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I was never a big fan of Emma prior to seeing this film.  Although this is a long adaptation, it is very well done.  It explores the characters and their growth like the book does.  Instead of there being an instant change of heart in Emma, you are able to see and understand how she comes to it.  I love the chemistry between Knightly and Emma and how it is captured on film.  Out of all the BBC remakes of Jane Austen, the actors cast are the closest to how I see them in my mind.  I enjoy this film and am glad that it is part of my Austen collection rather than a previous version.
B0044430H8|5.0|Fantastic.  Subtle textures. Exploration and variations on an underlying theme.  The whole thing flows together cohesively.  I am uninterested in the movie - this soundtrack stands by itself.  Wish this were twice as long.
0785134352|4.0|I love the movie, so I decided to buy the graphic novel. I have read better, and I think it was rushed. But I still think it's is a great story and I can't wait to read the next two sequels, I have a very dark sense of humor and Kick-ass the comic and it's movie really appealled to my sense of humor. A violent story about a loser trying to be less of a loser, his peers don't see him any less of a loser, and he doesn't end up seeing himself as any less of a loser either but that's is whole point of the story.  So, many of you will think the movie is better, because the movie has a different ending.
B001PL4HZW|4.0|I bought this for my wife who is a big Twilight fan. She loves it. It has some good songs on it. Supermassive Black Hole by Muse is interesting. I also like Spotlight by Mutemath. A couple of good tracks by Paramore. Overall I like this CD which is saying a lot for me. I usually don't like anything that is real popular.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|`Blair witch project' showed us that a video camera and a mystery could produce some spectacularly chilling effects. Paranormal activity is the result of the same experiment and proves that minimalist experiments can be chilling. The entire movie takes place in an apartment of a couple who are being haunted by a supernatural force. They decide to record the happenings with the help of a video camera and the movie is the result of the lost footage which was found later. The buildup is slow at first but the movie manages to scare us by the end. Horror Films are among my favorite genre and this is one of the scariest films that I have seen in a long time. I cannot wait for the 2nd part. I recommend that you watch the theatrical version and well as the alternate ending. I personally enjoyed the theatrical version. I Loved it. Five stars. 9/30/10
B0041ZQHHA|1.0|I'm reading these reviews and I can fairly say that any over-zealously generous reviews of this album are prejudiced by blind love for Brandon Flowers...<br /><br />I am familiar with The Killers' past work, including the artist-emulating transitions they've made from album to album. It has always been a disappointment to me to find the self-announced \\"creative\\" minds behind such albums to, in the same breath, parallel themselves with another artist. First it was 80's pop with a glam-rock Bowie'tude, followed by a sophomore album; cheap homage to Depeche Mode. They even had the nerve to slap Anton Corbijn photography and cinematography everywhere, so all the fans knew they were using Depeche Mode's photographer. Then came karaoke night in true Vegas fashion, with the pseudo imitations of U2, Bruce Springsteen (AS IF,) and Bob Dylan.<br /><br />Now THE Brandon Flowers blossoms off in to his own project, 'Flamingo'. His voice is incredibly poor; it sounds as though he's fidgeting at the mike. He's been doing this for WAY to long to be allowing his voice-diction and control to suffer. As an added bonus, all the songs sound the same. Whomever told him this was a good idea should be fired from IDJ; unless he had no choice because the rest of the guys were finally sick of working with him. Wouldn't be the first time he's had that problem...<br /><br />The album is crap. Bowie, Bono, Springsteen, etc. They perform as masters of their craft. If Brandon wants a marquee, he needs to earn it, instead of eeking by on the remnants of other artists' work.

1906355630|5.0|Adrian dispels the many myths associated with using Twitter, from it being a total waste of time to it being too complicated.  Whether you're a lawyer or other legal professional or, for that matter, a businessperson, Adrian provides practical advice on finding relevant people on Twitter and how to build your own following.    My favorite parts of the book are Chapters 11 and 12 where Adrian provides sound, yet simple and easy-to-follow, advice on using Twitter to get more clients. Of particular value was Adrian's suggestion to create a \\"freebie\\"; in other words, a document that addresses the most commonly asked questions by your prospective clients. Adrian then shows you how to use this freebie to capture leads.      My favorite quote from the book is:  \\"That is the real value of social media: it adds relationship building  to the website equation.\\"  Online marketing through the use of Twitter is a great way to begin that relationship.    I highly recommend the book to all businesspersons who are looking for ways to use Twitter to get more business.
030745455X|4.0|Following up on my completion of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I launched immediately into the second book of Stieg Larsson's trilogy... The Girl Who Played With Fire.  I enjoyed the continuing story of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist as they both get wrapped up in a story involving sex trafficking in Sweden.  But in terms of comparison to Dragon Tattoo,  Fire seemed to drag significantly in the middle stages, and I definitely take points off for the ending.  That was pushing believability to the far outer edges...<br /><br />Fire picks up at a point where you're not completely dependent on the first book to know what happens.  To fully understand the characters, you *do* need to have that background but it's not a direct continuation of the prior book.  Blomkvist becomes involved in a sex trade story when the two writers working on it for his newspaper are found murdered, along with Salander's state guardian who had abused her in the first book.  Because her fingerprints are found on the gun at the murder scene, she's the focus of a country-wide manhunt.  But she's conducting her own research into who killed who (along with Blomkvist), and has no intentions of turning herself in until she has answers.  Along the way, she uncovers some disturbing news about her past and her family, news that could end up exposing a major conspiracy at the highest levels of the Swedish government.<br /><br />The books in Larsson's trilogy are not short, so you know  you're in for a fair bit of reading to get to the end.  The danger there is that you'll end up getting into some slow areas, and Fire is no exception.  It might be due to all the Swedish names and such, but it started to get a little difficult keeping track of all the players, and the action was just marking time.  In addition, any news about Salander takes a BIG hiatus in the middle of the book, and I kept wondering where she was fitting into the whole story.  Finally, the ending (which I won't go into so as to not spoil it for others) was too far-fetched for me.  I know Salander is a bit of a \\"super-woman\\", but still...<br /><br />Even with my gripes, I'm still looking forward to reading The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest.  These are good reads, and I'm enjoying them quite a bit.  I do find it a shame that Larsson didn't remain alive long enough to see his novels take off like they have.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedothers) was too far-fetched for me.

1439190275|5.0|Atkins was the first diet I ever attempted 14 years ago.  I successfully lost 28 pounds and kept it off for three years.  Then, after a thyroidectomy, combined with the careless return to bad eating habits, I gained back twice as much.  Due to my new Synthroid medication, and the inability to get into \\"Ketosis\\", I did not go back on Atkins.  During the next six years, I tried every imaginable low calorie and fad diet.  Nothing worked, and I kept gaining.  I could never exercise enough, or eat little enough, to lose.  It was a vicious cycle that wore me out.<br /><br />Then, recently, I heard that Temple University has conducted a \\"low-carb vs low-calorie\\" diet and low carb won hands down, both for weight loss and heart health/cholesterol.  Soon after, I heard about \\"New Atkins for a New You\\".  I was waaaaaay ready for a new me.  So I ordered the book from Amazon and devoured it, figuratively speaking.<br /><br />Under the new Atkins plan, where ketosis isn't mentioned, I have lost eight pounds and a full clothing size in just three weeks and have finally gained control of my appetite.  There is no question that I can easily stick to this and it is working for me despite my medication.  The changes in the book, based on medical studies, make it even easier to do.  The book is very good at teaching us WHY Atkins works, and by the time you get to the \\"Get Started\\" Chapter, you are so pumped up you can't wait to begin.  And the best part is the total vindication of my hero, Dr. Atkins, who was a genius.  This book will change your life.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|The forth season is a real thriller.. Love Dex.  The cliff-hanger is a doozy. Hated it to end.. Can't wait for 5. This site is amazing.  Amazon is truly a one stop shop for many items. They have speedy shipping, which I am always surprised when my items arrive before I think they will and the cataloge is so informative, that it takes the guess work out of wondering what the item details. I'm very pleased to have this site is available to me, when I'm trying to find an specific item. I know if it's on Amazon, I won't be disappointed..
0061433047|5.0|I read that this was the best Tiffany Aching book yet.  I won't say that.  But it is possible.  I don't need to tell any Discworld fans it's a great read, they'll already know that.  But if you're not a fan, but like fantasy and great humor, read this and you'll be a fan.<br />I'm not a kid either, I'll be 70 in Dec and love Terry Pratchett's writings.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Very pleasantly surprised at the sound quality of these inexpensive headphones.  Very lightweight- perfect for almost any workout, and again, wow, the sound is truly amazing.<br /><br />I have a pair of Bose noise canceling headphones I use for the plane, and these are within a 2% range of sound quality- but when used in a fairly quiet gym.  But for eight bucks- one cannot go wrong!

B003UERZ88|5.0|After hearing the single \\"The Mower\\" I lost a lot of enthusiasm for this album. It was a pretty brutal extreme Metal song with screaming vocals and heavy guitar riffs--Not my cup of tea.<br /><br />Many fans love the heavier side of the Halford albums. Personally, I can't listen to Crucible without getting a headache. So imagine my delight when IV was firmly rooted in the classic Metal sound while leaning towards epic European Power Metal such as \\"Fire and Ice\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\".<br /><br />\\"Hell Razor\\" is my personal favorite on the album, because it sounds like Stained Class-era Priest. He's 59 years old and can still sing like that? Amazing. Great twin guitar solo in the middle. [Do I hear a cool bass solo too?]<br /><br />\\"Heartless\\" and \\"Matador\\" are some other great Metal songs and \\"Twenty-Five Years\\" is a very personal song about being a gay Metal frontman from 1973-1998 before he finally came out of the closet.<br /><br />This album is so obviously a masterpiece I am surprised to see such mixed reviews. The boxing lyrics of \\"Undisputed\\" are a bit awkward and \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" seems pretty average. Some people foolishly complain this is a hard rock album and not Metal. Umm I will trust Rob Halford's judgment on what is Metal. These people need to put down their Lamb of God and Trivium albums and get back to true Judas Priest style heavy metal. Made of Metal is a stunning and diverse collection of songs from the greatest singer in Metal.<br /><br />Rob Halford releases an especially great album at the beginning of each decade: 1980 British Steel, 1990 Painkiller, 2000 Resurrection, and now in 2010 Made of Metal.<br /><br />If you are a Priest fan or enjoy powerful heartfelt Metal like Doro or Hammerfall then you should definitely pick up this fantastic new HALFORD album.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This is a must have DVD for anyone slightly interested in the SOA.  Season 1 was great and season 2 is even better.  Excellent writting, directing and acting by all characters.
0345345061|3.0|These are good stories, but the \\"Reader\\" has been improved upon. Get the new \\"Tales from the Perilous Realm\\" that was released in 2008.  It has the same material here but even more, with excellent illustrations.
0061433047|5.0|Trained in witchcraft by experts like Nanny Ogg (unofficially in this case that is), Tiffany Aching has become the Witch of the Chalk.  Being young and wanting fun with and without witchcraft, Tiffany understands her responsibility to perform the spells to help those in need although she gains no acclaim as she does her work diligently in secret.  Adding to her discomfit is reactions of the normal are rarely what she expects them to be.<br /><br />However while at a fair feeling like a fool tied to her broom; just like the little kids with balloons, Tiffany senses something is not right.  Soon people begin to assault witches for no apparent reason beyond their normal fear of the witches.  She and her miniscule belligerent intoxicated pals, the Wee Free Men, begin to search what is playing on the trepidations of people towards witches.  Needing help, she journeys to Ankh Morpork to meet with Roland, the baron's heir and with a shopkeeper before returning to confront whatever evil is stalking the Chalk.<br /><br />Targeting teens, the fourth Aching fantasy (see The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky and Wintersmith) is a terrific entry that will have readers fully engrossed in the exciting story line.  Yet the tale also ponders deep philosophical issues of esteem, fitting in (or not) and it's okay to be different and to a degree alone while making a strong case to speak up if you are domestic abuse victim.  All that and more without decelerating and linked to the Discworld saga; fans of that great satirical series will also relish Tiffany's coming of age final test escapades<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0307408833|1.0|The one elusive thing in my many vegan baking adventures has been making a good icing that is sweet, tasty, and yet doesn't melt all over the place.  Vegan frosted treats that can stand a bake-sale on a sunny day?  GOOD LUCK!!    I find the cupcakes at BabyCakes in LA to be super subpar, but their icing is delicious and stands the test of time.  I got the book for the icing alone - I can make much better cakes myself.    This icing is NOT what they serve in the bakery.  The warning signs flashed when I saw that it called for only 1/4 cup agave.  REALLY, now?  All other icing recipes call for a couple cups of sugar, yet this one only needs 1/4 cup sweetener, but cups and cups of expensive soy products and coconut oil?  Just from reading, I knew it had to be off, but I tried it anyway - some recipes surprise you, but not this one!    The result?  A beautiful and perfectly textured LOOKING icing that tastes like a mouthful of soy flour and oil (basically what the recipe is).  NOT SWEET, definitely NOT something to share with guests or kids who want that icing corner of the cake!      I understand that I can attempt the other variation to make this with rice milk and powder, but WHY spend that much money to try again, when the original soy recipe in the book is so horrible, as well as all the other reviews here?  UGH!!      I have a disgusting batch here now that I'm trying to doctor to salvage all these expensive ingredients.  This must have been a $7.00 batch of icing.  I could have just gone and bought a tub of Pillsbury icing.  That's vegan too!    Please people, for baked treats, get the \\"Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World\\" and \\"Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar\\".  They are SOOOO MUCH better, and they also include gluten-free variations that you can adapt to pretty much most of their recipes in the books!

1416589473|4.0|This paperback should appeal to any avid Guild Wars fan. It is a fun and easy read that paints an interesting picture of what things are like in the world of Ascalon and Kryta in the fantasy years leading up to the GW2 release.    The characters are interesting and, at times, comical. I had more than a few laughs picturing the scenes portrayed in the story. My only criticism of the writing is that the dialog was at times forced. The writers wanted us to know and understand charr, for example, but it seemed odd that the charr champion in their party was so talkative and forthcoming about her past. It seems that every character was like this, save for one that I won't name due to not wanting to spoil the plot.    The book has no illustrations what-so-ever, save for the cover and a map. But that's typical of paperbacks. All in all, a very worthwhile use of ten dollars and a handful of hours of my time. I look forward to the next two in the planned trilogy.
B0020BUWX2|2.0|SPOILERS! This novel is about a gifted young cellist, Mia, who is involved in a horrific car crash with her parents and younger brother.  Everyone except her gets killed. Mia transforms into some kind of spirit who is neither alive nor dead.  The disembodied Mia stays with her broken body in the ICU and watches as family members, her one friend, and her boyfriend go through various stages of coping.  At some point early on, disembodied Mia realizes she has the power to choose to return to her orphaned life and live or join the rest of her nuclear family in death.  The supposed big cliffhanger of the book is whether Mia will choose life or death.     And this is where the book fails.  There's never any doubt that Mia will \\"choose\\" to live, despite Forman's feeble attmept at creating a \\"will she or won't she\\" tension.  The book is filled with gems like \\"Gramps\\" (yes, really, he is called \\"Gramps\\") leaning over her comatose body, tears running down his face, saying, \\"It's okay . . . [i]f you want to go. Everyone wants you to stay.  I want you to stay more than I've ever wanted anything in my life.\\"  C'mon.  I'm pretty sure I've seen this scene in every bad soap opera.  Her characters are one-dimensional and you never really care about any of them.      I would have had more respect for the book if Forman had killed Mia off, but, of course, that would ruin the Hollywoodesque happy ending. I gave this book 2 stars instead of 1 because Forman is not a horrible writer.  And the concept itself is quite interesting, which is why I bought it.  Unfortunately, the book does not measure up.  Not worth buying.  Borrow or check out of the library.

0307278255|5.0|I love Alice Munro's short stories, and I don't want to snub her, but Lahiri's writing is that rare sort that comes along every fifty years or so. She is a master. I felt palpable anxiety in the story that dealt with alcoholism - that was one of my favorites, but that in no way touches the last three short stories of the book, which are connected. Not only did I cry upon finishing them (I read a lot, but I RARELY cry over fiction), but I reopened the book and re-read them immediately (that, truthfully, has NEVER happened).<br /><br />I can't wait to read everything she's ever written. Could not recommend this book more highly.
0439023483|5.0|I have never written a book review before, but I just feel compelled to tell people about this book and the two that follow.  It was truly amazing!  I was there every step of the way, I was a character in the book somehow!  I didn't feel like I was reading, I felt like I was there and witnessing.  What a ride.  I cannot believe it is over.
0811870413|5.0|Why use oil paints, you could just use paint on the computer and print it on an inkjet in 1 minute?  Why cook a meal when you can buy a microwave dinner?  Did you ever think that some people actually enjoy baking and cooking?    The book gets 3 stars because you don't have the attention span to make real bread?  Pathetic.  Like we need another same-day, quick bread book.  Betty Crocker has been printing that garbage for like 100 years. If you're in such a hurry, go buy a loaf at the store.  It will probably taste better than the same-day books and it only takes 10 minutes.  This book is designed to allow beginners and experts to benefit from detailed instructions.    Also, you are exaggerating the time required.  Some formulas require a lot of time, but it is mostly resting time.  Yes, some amount of work may be required over a 5 day period, but it's only a few minutes each day.    People would not buy a same-day wine or beer, but don't forget, making bread is a similar process.  It takes time for the yeast to develop the most optimal flavors.       With our GM food industry maybe one day you will have same-day chickens and beef and then you can eat it with your same-day bread.    Sorry, but I have been screwed by one too many \\"Baking\\" books that give recipes that taste like mass produced stuff from the store.     There are maybe a dozen quality artisan baking books, this is one of them.
B001FB5634|5.0|I finished this book awhile ago and I am still encouraging people to read it.  Personally speaking it's my top pick.  The book is an easy read but one that I actually found myself living as \\"the man\\" character.

B000002KCC|5.0|Some people reach an all too short-lived point in their lives where things suddenly focus and little else matters. Some \\"thing\\" is suddenly essential and intense. Life becomes something simple - we take another step or we don't, we take another drink or we don't, whatever, there seems to be the proverbial fork in the road and we know that it's very, very important that we make a choice. It seems to me that this point is generally reached through suffering and confussion and perhaps more than a little self-pity, and that these can obscure our knowing the importance of where we are when we are there, like being disoriented in a heavy fog.  Perhaps only in retrospect do we realize how important the time was. Everything seems to come down to the moment, right here, right now. Tonigh's the night, not tomorrow, not next week, tonight. Some of us, the artists or poets among us, can try to share this experience with others. Some of us will always hold these things within.    Tonight's the night we're going to hold a wake for freinds and lovers gone. We're going to drink a little, maybe get a little \\"f\\"ed-up so that we can get past our hang-ups and get down to the demons, right down to the heart of the matter, to the truth as we see it. To do this is important, no, essential, and now is the time. We might get a little maudlin, maybe get a little angry, shed a few tears, say a few prayers for the dead and for our own survival and well being. Perhaps everything we do won't be perfect but we're going to make it honest. We have to get beyond this or the self-pity will suck us down. If you want to you can join us and mourn for your own losses or ours. But it's got to be done, and it has to be done now. Hope exists and were going to find it tonight.    I'm glad I came to the party. Thanks for the invitation.    JS

0307473708|4.0|Perhaps I'd have given it a 5 if I had read it before watching the series. Unfortunately, it was hard to shake the characters I've come to know and love from the television. Not all the characters are represented in the same fashion within in the book.<br /><br />However, I know the show came out of the book. And what the book did well was develop the character of Dexter. Usually as readers we don't connect with and essentially fall in love with a serial killer. But Dexter is... different. Endearing? He struggles to fit in and be seen as normal, which many of us have experienced even without such a dark secret such as his.<br /><br />It's hard to call him a bad guy. He has redeeming qualities. And he has a Code that he adheres to.<br /><br />If you enjoy suspense thrillers, police dramas, etc. and are looking for something different - I'd recommend checking this one out
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Frozen is a horror/thriller that is semi-plausible and very intense.  Shawn Ashmore, Kevin Zegers and Emma Bell star as three friends who take a skiing/snowboarding trip one weekend.  They spend most of the day on the bunny hill and right before the place gets ready to close, they convince the chair lift attendant to give them one last ride.  Due to the circumstances that then follow on their way up the mountain, they are left stranded in the chair lift with no one around(the resort is only open Fri-Sun and it happens to be Sunday).  Frostbite starts to kick in very quickly and the friends have to try and decide how they're going to get out of this mess.  Add in a hungry pack of wolves and you have yourself an edge-of-your-seat thriller that has you rooting for the characters and actually feeling for them.  Definitely a fantastic film with great acting, great direction and decent dialogue.

B0037NELXO|3.0|the series started off pretty compelling the first few episodes.  however, this one started to annoy me.  i mean come-on....sookie seems to show practically no reaction to her gradma's murdered corpse.  you could say she is frozen in shock but then later that night she has the composure to clean up the blood \\"because her grandma wouldn't want the house to look like this\\"?  this seemed way to far fetched to be believable.  i don't care if you can read minds or not anyone seeing their closest family members murdered body in front of them would loose their sh%$.  Aside from that Sam started to annoy me the way he was so needy...  some of the dialog started to get a little try hard (the writers grasping a little) and boring.  Anyway, generally a fun show.  This episode did not make me compelled to jump up and watch the next one the way the previous episodes did.  Oh, well I'm sure it will probably get better.

0525951652|1.0|What a shame that the E-version is more expensive than the hard copies at Costco. There's no cost production that a hard book requires, and this is simply an example of greed.     Like so many other reviewers on here, I will absolutely wait for either a library copy or in just a couple of months these hardbacks will be selling cheaper than Costco and I can wait. I own a Kindle, and it's such a shame I am unable to use it for a book like this.     I encourage everyone with a Kindle or iPad to complain about this example of greed. Shame on you guys!

I am enjoying it more the 2nd time through becuase I am noticing the different expressions on their faces this time around.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|Back in 1999, \\"Blair Witch\\" started a trend which I feel, has started to wear out its welcome. SO many movies now have the hand-held camera and unknown actors to give them a \\"real\\" feel, and where using people who aren't on the A-list is a good idea, this film is just another(!) one of those \\"real\\" films which try to look convincing, sometimes with limited success.<br /><br />As any movie usually does, it has a somewhat slow start, not a bad thing, slowly building up into something which is a genuinely scary film. It is very well-staged, and several times I forgot it was a work of fiction. In many ways, this film is a retread, but some of the best ever made, were also retreads; you, the viewer, know exactly where it's going, but how it gets there, is where the enjoyment of this movie comes in. There are some surprises along the way.<br /><br />The featured couple are subjected to some visits, if you will, from some unseen presence from another realm; it isn't human (enthusiasts of this type of thing say some spirits are human, others aren't), and it doesn't want to just say \\"hello.\\" It has pain, fear, and death on its mind.<br /><br />One area where this film works so well, is the absence of over-the-top special effects, and the ones used are used sparingly. If you were to have a problem of this type in your own house, this is how it probably play out. You don't need a Steven Spielberg budget to made a good scary movie. And this movie is good. And scary. Nightly visits from something you can't see, when this thing doesn't have your best interest at heart, will, in time, send you over the edge. Like \\"Blair Witch,\\" a major part of this story, is the breakdown of the people who are dealing with this. Psychological thrillers often hit their mark with far more accuracy than some splatter-fest; where the latter isn't without merit, in terms of craftsmanship, these kind of movies aren't particularly scary. They're just gross.<br /><br />***Spoiler part***<br /><br />The thing which cost this otherwise good film a star, was the ending. All the way through, it has a realism to it, which makes the slow-moving story interesting, but the use of a computer-generated visual effect in the last scene, to jump out and yell \\"BOO!\\" at the viewer, is the self-administered shot to the foot mentioned in this review's title. It is an anti-climax, given the standard it set for itself early on. In the features section, an alternate ending is included, which I feel (a personal opinion, mind you), was far more effective, and convincing than the \\"official\\" ending. It was a poor decision to edit it as they did.<br /><br />But in all, this is a very good psychological thriller.m a star, was the ending.

1402573723|5.0|This was a very enlightening book. I felt like I learned a lot, and not in an axe-grinding or brow-beating way. It was really interesting, seeing what at least a small part of Nigeria was like, long before they were best known for e-mail scams.<br /><br />The story is about a man in a Nigerian village, living a traditional village life. We get glimpses into the everyday, festivals, weddings, funerals, religion, hierarchy, and all kinds of facets of village life. Then, just when we think that's all it is, in come the foreigners, marked as different by their white skin, separated by their traditions, religions and laws. And we all know how that ends.<br /><br />I found the story slow in places, and I was afraid it would be over before I got into it. The main character was very unlikeable, and his culture was incredibly dismissive of women, which often annoys me in literature. But, by the end of the book, I sympathized a lot with the domineering, supposedly primitive individual at the heart of the story, and I keenly felt his pain at having everything he'd ever known taken from him by these outsiders who didn't understand anything. I started to question a lot of my own assumptions about colonialism, and whether native cultures really are better off learning how to cope with the white world, rather than keeping their own cultures. Before listening to this audio book, I would've said clothing, modern medicine, abundant food and learning to read is worth it, but now I don't know, and I don't think the ones who integrate quickly are the ones to ask.<br /><br />I thought the story worked very well as an audio book. It's told in a storyteller's style, with repetition reminding us who the characters were and what their roles were. In a written book, that might've annoyed me. Hearing it aloud, it was a relief.<br /><br />I didn't much like the narrator, though. He had this gravelly, \\"manly\\" sort of voice that sounded very American. I think it would be silly to have a native narrator read it, accent and all, but the flow of the language was often stymied by the narrator's pausing right after or before unfamiliar and hard-to-pronounce words.<br /><br />Overall, though, I thought this was an excellent choice for an audio edition, and I'm glad I took it out from the library. I really feel like I learned a lot, and am entertaining questions I should've been thinking a lot more about all along.ll, but the flow of the language was often stymied by the narrator's pausing right after or before unfamiliar and hard-to-pronounce words.

B00003CXBH|5.0|I've been exploring Jeremy Irons' work for about a year now. The Mission is one of his movies that is newest to me as a viewer despite being released when I was 4. I think Irons' is a fine actor, but often don't care for the type of men he plays. The Mission is a *positive* glaring exception. His Father Gabriel is wonderful. A man of peace, faith, and nonviolence yet he was also a just leader that led by example. Gabriel also loves people. Whether they be his brothers in the faith, the Indians he taught, or Rodrigo, the lost one that he attempts to guide.    This movie is very powerful in demonstrating the contrast between the positive aspects of mankind and the negative ones. The locations are beautiful, the story moving. The conclusion of this piece may give some pause. It certainly got me thinking and I appreciate that very much.     Seeing Liam Neeson in a minor supporting part here was a true pleasure. I found it nice to actually see Neeson and Irons working together (especially since they are 2 of my favorite UK actors). Whereas in Kingdom of Heaven, Liam and Jeremy both appear in the film but not together.    Main themes are: working past anger, forgiveness, love, conviction, and justice vs.injustice.
B001KX50BK|5.0|[[ASIN:B001KX50BK Pretty Woman [Blu-ray]]]  I saw this movie when it first came out, and several times since, but I didn't realize how much I missed until I saw it on Blu-Ray!!  This DVD has scenes that were not included in the original film, also it includes some \\"Bloopers\\", which are great.  I would highly recommend this Blu-Ray DVD to anyone!!  If you saw the original - then your in for a real treat with this Blu-Ray DVD!!  Don't have a Blu-Ray VCR?  Buy One!  You'll be glad you did!!!

B001P9EQH8|4.0|It does boost volume so for that I will give it a good review.  It does not improve sound quality and the bass increase button does not work for bass but it does change sound slightly.  I am only using it for increasing volume for work outs and lawn care, other than that it is not a good choice.

B002N5N5M0|4.0|I've watched the first three seasons of Dexter on DVD and have enjoyed the series very much.  I've just finished watching the first two episodes of the fourth season on DVD and wondered if anyone else has noticed that the picture quality on this season's DVD doesn't seem quite as sharp as the previous seasons.  It's very subtle and I'm sure the casual viewer might not notice, but the picture has a grainier appearance throughout, most noticeably in darker scenes.  (I have a high quality television.)  Perhaps it's a bad authoring job of the DVD or maybe the show has switched picture capture techniques on set (perhaps something like switching from film to HD cameras) but I'd be curious to know if anyone has noticed this or an industry-insider could provide some insight.  (As some background, I rented my copy at Blockuster and they were delayed in getting the fourth season for some reason.  Total speculation on my part, but perhaps the DVD authoring was a rush job?)
0525951652|5.0|I have been reading all of the one star reviews of this book, and people are giving this masterpiece of a story a one star because of the price set forth by the publisher. Don't miss this wonderful story because of the ebook price. Go to the library. Don't boycott it.  Long live the printed book
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|I lost interest in Clapton long ago, not because he had stopped doing the \\"Cream thing,\\" but, on the contrary, because he did not evolve as a guitarist. Instead, he became some sort of bland performer for all seasons, who just happened to be able to fall back on some fine guitar playing when people began to fall asleep due to his expressionless voice and bluesy noodlings. He actually became a singer who could play guitar on the side, and no one told him that as a singer he just wasn't all that great... really not. Between cringeworthy sentimental pop and tired, repetitive blues, he had erased himself off of my radar. But recently, I saw this CD at a friend's and thought I'd give it a try, for old time's sake. I was flabbergasted. To descend into mediocrity is bad enough, but to descend to the depths from which even a cohort of brilliant helpers cannot extricate you - wow, that takes some doing. This must be the most boring album of the month. I cannot believe all these five-star reviews. Man, it's great to have such faithful fans. Is it possible that none of them crave something new? This must be the crowd that is able to listen to \\"Darling, You Look Wonderful Tonight\\" for the millionth time without snoring. Well, not me. Goodbye, Eric.
B0036EH3XE|2.0|The \\"religioso\\" ending with all the good guys meeting up in Heaven is what - a disappointment?  Writer exhaustion? Hollywood gone amok? A cop-out? Throughout the 6-year run, like many other reviewers, I had my suspicions about the writers doing a mass improvisation from episode to episode, but I was usually willing to go along for the ride (hell, it was entertaining and engrossing!), looking forward to see how our heros would deal with their latest fix. Even throughout seasons 5 & 6 I was totally into it, watching what I suspected to be some kind of parallel universe unfolding, with the twist of the characters slowly coming together in the later episodes. Of course everything logically pointed to some sort of supernatural ending, but \\"logic\\" never struck me as being a word to describe Lost. Something more creative was called for.
B003HGKJH8|4.0|Great album. It's dense, trippy, cherry if not always cheery, psychedelia with a stoner vibe. Try \\"Runway, Houses, City, Clouds\\" \\"It's Not Meant to Be\\" or \\"Why Won't You Make Your Mind?\\" if you're not sure. But you will be. There's not a bad track here. Their new album, Lonerism, is also great, though this one might be even better.
B0043SGAPO|3.0|I was disappointed that this was merely a rehash of old material - rumors had been swirling about new material since they announced their reunion.  The only previously unreleased song is actually from Outshined sessions, so even it is not really a new collaboration.  I am a long-time fan with all the prior albums, so nothing new to add here.  For those without the previous albums, this is probably a good retrospective, especially with the inclusion of early material (although I really don't care much for their earlier stuff - Loud Love was the first place they began to really develop their sound, but Outshined is, in my opinion, when they came into their own as a band - most stuff before then was so-so at best). Overall, good hits collection, but nothing new for the fans here.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|I am consistently pleased with Amazon.com's service. They offer a wide variety of products and their follow-up is efficient.  Amazon.com is number 1 in my book.

B003TML0VO|2.0|This is a mistake from start to finish. A concept that is obviously ONLY about money, and I'm a little surprised Santana allowed himself to be used here since he's already got plenty of it.     The guitar obsessed will also be disappointed cause Santana simply doesn't do the Jimmy Page or hard Rock thing that great. He's a spiritual player in the Coltrane vein.    [...]

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|****REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS****       At first, i wanted to hate this book.  The night i finished reading it, by whole being felt utterly sickened with disgust.  i wanted to throw it away, to toss it out my window and forget that i ever read it, keeping my loving memories of the beauty of the Hunger Games and Catching FIre untainted.  Looking back, im glad i refrained from reviewing for a good week, because god forbid, if i would have the night i finished it, you probably would have more of a hate letter to Collins then a review.      I'm certainly not saying that i have grown to like the book, but my loathing towards it has instead become a dull appreciation.  The book is good, but there are many good books which i don't like.  In hindsight, what triggered my initial reaction of hate was how depressed this book made me.  Not because of the dark context or the countless deaths that occur within it (i actually love dark reads), but because for me, it ruined what had the potential to go down in history as one of the best trilogy's of its time.  It could have been truly amazing, but instead fizzled out into yet another piece of work that in my mind will always be remembered as \\"what could have been\\" instead of \\"what was.\\"          I appreciate what Collins was trying to do, delving into the messy effects that war has on the human being, and in fact she does this quite brilliantly.  However for Katniss to be the subject of this study is both unfair to her, and to the reader.  To take such a beautiful and dynamic character and utterly destroy her to the point where she is a hollow shell of nothingness is unforgivable in a book where hope, and love are (or at least were) the driving forces behind said character.  Collins strategy would have worked brilliantly in another trilogy, but not this one.  I loved Katniss in the first two books.  She was a work of art, what any aspiring author would hope to be the creator of.  Beautiful and fierce, loving and conflicted, noble yet filled with cowardice, this is the Katniss i fell in love with, not the hollow empty animal who's only concern is survival.  Where in the Hunger Games she is haunted by the innocents she kills, in Mockingjay she coldly puts an arrow through the heart of an innocent lady without a second thought.  This instance of murder, the very evil she blames the capitol of, struck home with me.  What it told me was Katniss is gone, dead, null and void.  She truly did die when she volunteered to take Prim's place in the games, and the instant she lets her bowstring go, the life of Katniss comes to an end.  In that moment, she herself becomes an advocate of the evil that fueled her defiance in the Hunger Games and Catching Fire, murder.  As the book wore on i found myself urging on her suicidal moments because as dear as she was to me, i couldn't bear the hollow creature of a character that filled the pages.  In my opinion the only thing she shared with the character i loved was a name.          Speaking of dead characters, for some reason Collins felt the need to kill off all of the hope bearing ones in Mockingjay.  I don't know if it was supposed to be a plot tool or not, but if it was then it failed on epic proportions.  Character deaths are an essential tool to creating suspense, drawing forth emotions, providing a pivotal cause of inspiration for the main character, or any other plot driving means.  In the Hunger Games, Rue's death illustrates the masterful work of a great author using the death of a loved character as a plot tool.  But in Mockingjay, Prims, Cinnas, and Finnick's deaths are presented as almost meaningless.  At least Prim's served the plot in some ways, but i was appaled with the fact that Finnick's was almost an afterthought, and didn't merit more than a few sentences.  Finnick brought a sort of light playfulness to the story and in my mind was an amazingly well drawn out character with all his complexities.  So to kill him off just for the hell of it because Katniss was too slow climbing a ladder, and then to present her as indifferent about it was unacceptable.        Im not even going to get started on Peeta's hijacking because that almost deserves another review in itself, but suffice to say it was just a cheep trick to prolong the love triangle, create emotional 'strife' for Katniss, and keep him out of the story until Collins was ready to use him.        Another personal gripe with the book that i don't want to get into for space and times sake was Beete's cyber wars the the capitol for airtime. Honestly??? Who the **** is going to be watching tv while their city is being attacked??  To me it reeked of an author with pages to fill, a deadline to meet,  and not enough time to fill it.        I really wish there were more good things i could say about this book.  But I guess u just can't have your main character hiding in corners, incapacitated in hospital beds, or drugged to unconsciousness 75% of the book, and still have an amazing read.  good? maybe, but amazing, no.    I loved the first two books and read them multiple times.  I hurt when the characters hurt, was sad when they were, and elated in their moments of elation.  They conjured emotions so beautifully and at times even gave me the chills.  However the only emotion this book was able to bring forth was disappointment.  It just didn't live up to my high hopes after reading two of the most amazing books published in recent years.  As an aspiring young writer, ill look to The Hunger Games and Catching Fire for clues to what makes great literature work, and to Mockingjay for what doesn't.          Just as Peeta, confused about his reality, asks throughout the book \\"real or not real?\\" i'm left with the same question about the book, real or not real?  Unfortunately i think the answer to this one is \\"not.\\"
B000002J1O|5.0|I owned about 1000 LPs before I purchased my first CD in 1987. This was it, even though I had a perfect vinyl copy of it already. This album is that good. Other reviewers are better about describing the contents in intimate detail, but if you are completely unfamiliar with early Genesis, it's a good starting point.     You might also like to know that every album through Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is completely different from the last, with the possible exception of Foxtrot after Nursery Cryme. And they are all spectacular. Caveat: the first, From Genesis to Revelation, is really more of a nicely produced set of song demos - not really an album by the band proper.
0307463745|5.0|I wish I had read this book 13 years ago. I had 2 businesses and both failed, and I took a full time job as a Program Manager since 2003 for a global IT company. Ever since then I have been holding myself back from starting another. Reading rework was a humbling experience and I can't believe how \\"silly\\" I have been 13 years ago. I am now learning Ruby on Rails and can't wait to \\"scratch my own itch\\". Taking one step at a time from what Rework has thought me, I am sure I will be up and running on my own soon enough...To the visionary people at 37Signals...THANK YOU. Gabe.
0553382179|5.0|I was sick for 4 years with a debilitating illness.  I was in bed for 2 years and on the couch for 2 more.  I started feeling better and was able to do small things around the house but the condition of the house was overwhelming.  So I heard about this book and thought that I would give it a try.  Being sick for so long, it seems that I also needed to learn cleaning habits again.  This book SINK REFLECTIONS helps you to get in the cleaning habit a little at a time.  I'm feeling so much better, and my house is a reflection of that today!  Thanks Flylady!
0393325172|4.0|I've enjoyed reading the [[ASIN:B002VPE7ZQ Mutiny on the Bounty (Back Bay Books)]] and [[ASIN:0316738883 Men Against the Sea: A Novel]], as well the non-fiction sea-faring book [[ASIN:0393337014 The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea]].  So, when I saw Master and Commander recommended in several places by those who only recommend \\"good\\" or \\"living\\" books, that are both enjoyable to read and also quality writing, I was intrigued.    And, I did very much enjoy this book.  The author is a skilled writer, especially good at characterization, breathing life into his characters.  He also writes with rich language, with each word carefully chosen.  Many words are used that are not in the average person's everyday speech, but they aren't so obscure that meaning is unclear.  An example from the first page where the two main characters are listening to a musical performance:    \\"The listener farther to the left was a man of between twenty and thirty whose big form overflowed his seat, leaving only a streak of gilt wood to be seen here and there.  He was wearing his best uniform ... and the deep white cuff of his gold-buttoned sleeve beat the time, while his bright blue eyes, staring from what would have been a pink-and-white face if it had not been so deeply tanned, gazed fixedly at the bow of the first violin.  The high note came, the pause, the resolution; and with the resolution the sailor's fist swept firmly down upon his knee.  He leant back in his chair, extinguishing it entirely, sighed happily and turned toward his neighbour with a smile.  The words `Very finely played, sir, I believe' were formed in his gullet if not quite in his mouth when he caught the cold and indeed inimical look and heard the whisper, `If you really must beat the measure, sir, let me entreat you to do so in time, and not half a beat ahead.'\\"    Two negatives make this book a 4-star for me rather than a 5-star:  1) There end up being some difficulties between the captain and one of his officers.  But, in the initial stages, they aren't very well-developed.  It just feels like they came from nowhere, and that the author just declared them rather than showing them.  This is true even later in the book; I just didn't have a good handle on them.  This is the only part of the book that I felt had anything but skillful characterization, but unfortunately it was a bit inept on this point.  The officer's character just wasn't characterized well.  2) There is a smattering of profanity and one crude expression.  This doesn't bother many people, but it does me.  The book, however, is good enough, and the profanity occasional enough, that I'm willing to just take a black permanent marker to them.    Overall, I would definitely recommend this book to those who enjoy historical fiction, especially of the sea-faring variety.  With one exception the characterization is wonderful, and the writing is a joy to read throughout.  My only caution would be for those who would be too bothered by occasional profanity.  I will definitely read this book again and plan to get the next couple books in the series.
B000BTJDG2|4.0|I'm a counselor and I was really interested to see how this movie was put together. As it was described, it is loosely based on the real story of Emily Rose.  I personally don't think this woman was posed, but rather had an severe form of Schizophrenia as well as grandmaul siezures. Then combined with her families religous beliefs and probably the rarity of her condition made it seem like possession....waht I found interesting, is that she came from a very devoutly religous catholic family. there is a correlation of \\"spirital\\" psychotic states when a person is more devout. Also the age of onset is right in line for schizophrenia.    having said that it was a bit freaky and the special effects really make you feel for someone having pscyhotic delusion..then combined with severe brain active of grand maul seizures contorting hte body could make anyone look possed...i personally ahve seen a grand maul seizure and it is VERY scary.    very cool movie that makes you think...recommend.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Give Robert Plant this: while many of his contemporaries have chosen to keep their careers alive by constantly revisiting their back catalog and releasing uninspired new work, he has opted to take the journey into rhythms and sounds from around the world and incorporating it into rock and other genres.  It meant a sort of uneven first leg of his solo career, but one that you could respect for trying to evolve beyond the Led Zeppelin days.  But beginning with the \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" disc - and perhaps even before that with \\"Dreamland\\" - Mr. Plant has hit upon a very consistently appealing run of great music.      \\"Band of Joy\\" is the latest in this run.  Perhaps it was an alternative after the attempts to create a sequel to \\"Raising Sand\\" with Alison Krauss was put on hold, or maybe not.  What we know for sure is that Mr. Plant has really tapped the vein of American roots music and fully embraced it, so \\"Band of Joy\\" is the natural progression of that interest.  Here, he pairs with producer Buddy Miller - who was a bandmate on the \\"Raising Sand\\" tour - but the production is very much in the school of T. Bone Burnett, where tone and purity of the musical sounds provide a rich, almost haunting, quality.  Mr. Plant and Mr. Miller gather a host of songs throughout the Americana landscape that run the gamut of country, blues, spiritual, and rock.  Also included is an original Plant composition, \\"Central Two-O-Nine\\", that sounds as though it could easily have been retrieved from the long-forgotten Depression-era blues/roots archives.      Mr. Plant's voice has aged well with time, and he has learned over the years to modulate it well, providing a wider range of emotion and storytelling throughout the songs.  He is still quite capable of unleashing his primal roar from the Led Zeppelin days (as evidenced for those fortunate to see the \\"Raising Sand\\" tour). But on \\"Band of Joy\\", he restrains it for the most part.  That is not a liability, as his vocals instead run the gamutto evoke pain, haunting torture, playfulness, joy, bluesy soul, and even a hint of classic \\"high lonesome\\" sprinkled in.  What he ultimately proves here is that he is almost a more dynamic vocalist in his 60's than he may have been in his rock god heyday.    \\"Angel Dance\\" - a cover of a Los Lobos song - leads off the disc and was also the first single.  It is a catchy, enjoyable interpretation.  The aforementioned \\"Central Two-O-Nine\\" is also a standout, as is the traditional song \\"Cindy I'll Marry You Someday\\", and the haunting \\"Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down\\".  The last track - \\"Even This Shall Pass Away\\" - almost sounds like a leftover from the \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" sessions, but still fits in with the canvas of songs on this disc.    Since it's release a few weeks ago, \\"Band of Joy\\" has been a near-permanent fixture in my CD player and in my MP3 player.  I feel like I continue to hear new things with each successive listen, and so that alone makes it a truly enjoyable disc.  I think that this may very well be one of the best new discs I have heard this year, and deepens my respect for Robert Plant and the musical journey he has shared with us.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|In the movie \\"Tropic Thunder\\" there is a gag about Ben Stiller's character having made a movie called \\"Simple Jack\\" -- the heartwarming story of a retarded boy produced as a cynical attempt to get an Oscar.  Certainly actors have been given many awards for portraying the mentally ill or mentally retarded.  Set that gimmickry aside and spend some time with this wonderful movie.    I've read several of Professor Grandin's books and had the opportunity to hear her give a presentation in St. Louis.  Claire Danes' performance is positively unreal.  Her acting is spot-on, and the movie does the impossible by allowing you to see the world as she sees it.  The tricks are subtle, but they work extraordinarily well.      The movie never romanticizes her.  She doesn't act like a normal person and never will.  She doesn't understand how the \\"real of us\\" think, and as brilliant as she is, she has powerful intellectual deficits.  Her speech, movements, and complete lack of social skills are all carefully reconstructed.  That said, she has a dazzling intellect and her contributions to the animal handling industry have made the world a kinder place.       As others have written, this movie isn't just interesting; it's also enjoyable to watch -- though scenes of her being teased and harassed made me want to punch someone.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|This film is a visual feast of action and special effects. Jake Gyllenhaal, playing the lead role as Prince Dastan, does a good job of moving into role of dashing and handsome action hero.   Gemma Arterton, one of the most beautiful women on earth, plays Princess Tamina.  Both actors are able to convey the over the top acting style necessary to compete with the exceptional effects. This is not an art film that requires subtle understated acting but rather requires robust over-statement to balance the incredible visual effects.  Don't take this as criticism. If you want a subtle Gyllenhaal, watch Brokeback Mountain. If you want an action hero Gyllenhaal, this is the film for you. The art direction was superb with construction of an ancient empire, Persia, with all its grandeur. The cinematography was also superb with visual effects in virtually every frame of the film. The beautiful North African landscape of Morocco evoked a visual time and place for the viewer.  The film requires the viewer to suspend judgment and to forget any knowledge they have of Persia, Islam, Sufism, and Zorasterism; since in this film there is great literary license taken around the cultures that make up the Persian Empire (ancient Iran). The Prince of Persia delivers visually stunning entertainment with incredible editing to keep your eyes and mind engaged at all times. The storyline is not especially complicated but that is never a problem since the action and visuals are certainly the primary focus.  Ben Kingsley is the only character that doesn't need to overstate their performance. As the younger brother to the King, he is the primary character that the audience must try to figure out as does Prince Dastan. The incredible acting skills of Alfred Molina are evident in the role of Sheik Amar and I think Molina could have stolen the show if this character had been more developed.  Steve Toussaint, an incredible physical force, as the African slave Seso, has a wonderful fight scene with theHassansins, a group trained to specialize in assassinations. Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle play the two biological princes and adopted brother to Prince Dastan. Both do a great job. Overall, this is pure fantasy entertainment produced at the highest level of quality.
B00062NEA0|5.0|[[ASIN:B00062NEA0 Star Trek: The Motion Picture(Special Longer Version)]]    I was very satisfied with this video. Being a Huge fan of this first movie in the original Star Trek Movie Series I have always felt that this was my favorite out of the 6. I loved seeing the various added / deleted scenes from other versions of the film inserted here in this version. I recommend this version to anyone that may agree and feel the same; this is an excellent collectable to own and at such a great price as well. Even though it's available on vhs it still looked great and was brand new and never owned.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|The visual detail and audio quality of this blu-ray transfer is excellent. I was blown away by the level of detail in the scenes and the quality of the sound, especially in action sequences. Highly-recommended for any Star Trek fan who wishes to build up your blu-ray collection!
0312600844|5.0|A very very good book, just maybe slightly disappointing in that it is not the greatest book ever written, as one would be led to believe by the many glowing reviews in the current media.  Tough to fault Mr. Franzen for that, though, as I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, especially the last hundred pages, and in particular the final scene, which I can't wait to see on a movie screen sometime soon.  The characters are believably complex and lovable and the story is certainly engrossing.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all readers.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Going into this movie I admit I didn't expect much from it, I thought it would be really cheesy.  But I found it to be interesting and it definitely kept my attention the whole way through, so it exceeded my expectations.  The acting did wobble in areas, the dialogue was juvenile at times and there were some really unrealistic moments where you wondered why any sane person would make that choice and not go with the logical choice. I thought the wolves were unrealistic and not true to the location or their natural behavior either.  But it's just a movie so I went with it.  There was no gratuitous nudity that seems so typical in this type of movie, so kudos to them on that.  It's not going to win an Oscar, but it was a good film and is better than a lot of the garbage out there.

0312600844|1.0|I couldn't finish it.  I kept reading, hoping it would get better; complete waste of time. The story is miserable. If you like listening to gossipy neighbors, then you may like it.  The writer has a bad attitude and hates people.    BTW Oprah sucks. I saw that it was on her book list...figures. If she really did read it, then it gives you some insight about the way she sees the world.
0545265355|5.0|This compelling trilogy examines the brutality of war and the desensitization of a media-saturated society. Katniss is a strong and thoughtful young heroine, and readers will be haunted by her long after the final chapter of Mockingjay. In Hunger Games you will be introduced to the characters and their trials will keep you on the edge of your seat. In Catching Fire you will find out that no one is safe from the clutches of the Capitol. In Mockingjay you will feel the stirrings of revolution, and the dread that comes along with leaving relative safety for the unknown. These books are terrific for a book club, or for kids to read with their parents.

When her parents get lost in a dark wood and find a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park, even a sullen little girl has better sense then they. But in they go, and make the mistake of staying after dark; they are turned into pigs and taken away; Chihiro must save them. To do so, she must surrmount increasingly difficult challenges, growing with each new puzzle and threat into a resilient, resourceful girl who survives on her wits, her kindness, and the integrity of her spirit. An excellent introduction to horror and dark fantasy for children who are old enough not to be too frightened by the spirits; probably try it when they get to about Chihiro's age (10).
B002ZG983M|5.0|I will not be covering the storyline - as others seem to have done that fine - but I will say that this film has something for everyone, great storyline, great acting, plenty of action (some might say too much explicit violence - but not me, it suited the plot of the movie). It had humour in the right places, it had edge of youR seat drama. The main characters were a treat to watch - let's hope there is a sequel !! You can see this movie has one of the highest star rating of any movie on Amazon & Deservedly so.    And it's a British film - see, we can make great movies !!
0767834739|2.0|Alice wakes up to a plague in Raccoon City. Trapped with a small group of survivors, she is forced into finding the daughter of one of the scientists on the t-virus project, in exchange for passage out of the cordoned-off city. But now there's a new threat--along with the zombies and killer hounds, there is Nemesis, a post-human armored mutant. Lucky for Alice she's been given new abilities while she was sleeping. A great excuse for a lot of violence, with very little plot. The makers of Apocalypse don't really understand horror, believing, apparently that special effects and graphic destruction create terror. They don't.
B0037QGS0A|1.0|This movie was horrible.  Amanda Seyfried's character is not a mature seductress.  She's so unrealistic that she's predictable.  Julianne Moore is a great actress, but I was disappointed she did nude scenes for this piece of trash movie.  Liam Neesom was great as usual and I thought the new actor, Max Theriot (as Neesom and Moore's son, Michael) did a nice job and I'd like to see more of him.

Although this book is simple, it's profound and it's wise.<br />I started being a non-conformist as as kid but took the path of least resistance to the road of convention until about seven years ago when I quit the practice of law, wrote my first book, and put passion before profit while trying to have a purpose.<br />What I most appreciate about Chris' book and his philosophy from his blogs and other writings is that for him, it's not just about being a \\"wild child\\" or a \\"rebel without a clue\\". It is about being yourself, finding your own path and doing good in the world. Let me repeat - doing good in the world. That last piece is what distinguishes him from a lot of self-proclaimed gurus who advocate the art of getting yours without really addressing the joy in sharing \\"yours\\" with the world.<br />Chris' book is about abundance, but it's also about spiritual and material generosity too.<br />I loved the book, and from meeting Chris during his book tour last week, I've got an author's crush on him too because he really is as nice and warm, yet shy as he appears to be from his writings, and he has an authenticity about him that comes through in person as well as it does on the page.<br />The book is a comforting, yet inspiring read and I've got an open-ended ticket on his path to \\"World Domination\\"!

0385737955|2.0|I wanted to like this book so much. I just finished reading [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]], and heard this book was similar. Basically a number of boys (I think around 100-200?) are trapped in a walled glade that has a maze and blahblahblah I think you probably already know the summary, right? I don't think it's a spoiler to say that these kids are put there as a part of an experiment/competition to see which ones of them will come out alive (and there's more but it's a spoiler.) Okay, fair enough sounds good so far.<br /><br />We open the book with a bang, Thomas wakes up in an elevator shaft and is pulled up by a group of kids. His memory is gone he has a million questions. The bang quickly fizzles into a study of 'how much can i frustrate the reader before the reader flings the book across the room' as EVERY question Thomas asks is deflected with 'We'll tell you later, stop asking questions.' I am sure the writer is trying to build up suspense but he only succeeds in annoying the reader. There is no good reason to keep those questions unanswered for that long.<br /><br />The slang was annoying. I realize that it's a KID'S BOOK and using the common words for feces and genitals in every other sentence just isn't going to fly but reading words like clunk and shank every few sentences was annoying.<br /><br />Another thing was that the story is written in such a way that groups of people are just standing around doing nothing while two or three characters interact. This is most noticeable near the end. There are supposed to be 20 or 30 people present and they all just stand and stare while the main characters do stuff. It's kind of like in [[ASIN:B0036EH3WK Lost: The Complete Collection [Blu-ray]]] Where the main gang does stuff and the other characters are just useless background people who's main job is to die in dramatic ways.<br /><br />The introduction of Theresa (actually I just want to call her Smurfette as she is the lone bagel in the sausage factory.) is jarring and comes too quick. She is comatose and useless for a good portion of the book and her sheer existence brings up too many uncomfortable questions. Being a KIDS BOOK, all 200 of the teenage boys are perfect little gentlemen and wouldn't even think of being inappropriate with her. (In the same KIDS BOOK the author doesn't mind brutally kidnapping torturing and killing children though.) The 'magical connection' between her and Thomas felt completely out of place for this story and setting. It was unnecessary, and turned a dystopian adventure book into a borderline princess fairy book (okay, i'm exaggerating on that one but really a simple walkie-talkie or a cellphone could have accomplished the same thing and allowed the story to remain scientific and not breach the level where suspension of disbelief becomes a hardship.)<br /><br />The most frustrating thing about this book was the ending wherein we are explained the reasons behind why the kids were put in the maze. The fact that only boys were selected (Smurfette doesn't count) immediately becomes a glaring sign of sexism. (No there's no maze for girls anywhere nearby to give the female brain a chance (or maybe i'm wrong, is there a female group B?.) But at least there are non-white people in the book who play major roles... And some of the scientists are female...) The idea that this maze test can accomplish the goal better than other methods (for example methods that wont EMOTIONALLY SCAR AND TRAUMATIZE these kids for life) is laughable and depressing.<br /><br />I think this was a creative idea that just wasn't creative enough to make sense and be logical.s jarring and comes too quick.

055338466X|2.0|Pr&eacute;cis: A brief introduction . . .<br /><br />In reading the other reviews of The Grand Design (\\"TGD\\"), including the top reviews, one conversant with these matters actually feels a moral incumbency to respond in reading their respective qualifications in dealing with the assertion that \\"philosophy is dead.\\"  The reviewers' qualification is that \\"philosophy is dead in the sense of answering the most mysterious of life's questions. It is up to science, and scientific theory, to provide clues to the true answers, as philosophy in its most ancient forms has taken a back seat, but modern philosophy, that of scientific philosophy, has taken root.\\"  Or, take the review that states \\"I was concerned by some of the things that were said at the outset such as \\"'philosophy is dead'\\" - each academic discipline requires years of study and can't reasonably be dismissed out of hand by someone who is an expert in another field - but my concerns were eased by the rest of the book.<br /><br />In other words, the \\"science\\" vindicates Hawking's sweeping statement(s).  As this lengthy review intends to prove, such conclusions are wrong, they entirely miss the point, and the content of TGD was entirely predictable given Hawking's previous materials.  TGD actually evidences that Hawking and Mlodinow have past the boundaries of extreme philosophical antirealism to the point of providing young-earth creationism justification on par with the lambda cold dark matter concordance model of the universe!--that should wake the reviewers up.<br /><br />For reason(s) argued below, this book lends itself to natural philosophy wrapped up with scientific speculation that reaches the boundaries of anti-realism (minus the usual nod to STR, GTR, quantum mechanisms and the Standard Model found in practically every other pop-science book).  These issues have been rehearsed ad infinitum.  After reading and re-reading the relevant aspects of The Grand Design, I would argue that it should contain the ISBN earmark placing it in the genre of philosophy/science section.<br /><br />In reading Stephen Hawking's books and other materials, it is easy to trace the progression of Hawking's thoughts and arguments as they relate the universe that are ultimately an expression of his worldview, scientific naturalism, and that lead to his public pronouncements that his is now an atheist, allegedly backed up by science as expressed in TGD--an issue that has nothing to do with science as this review/critique argues below.<br /><br />That is, Hawking's atheism has nothing to do with scientific discovery, theories, models or ad hoc assertions, but is premised upon very speculative and even rich philosophical views many of which are encapsulated by his TGD. Moreover, the alleged \\"shock value\\" of the Discovery channel's 2012 presentation of TGD (the Discovery program surprisingly focuses on this issue of \\"consciousness,\\" which is not a major topic in TGD but only a medium to their view; thankfully, as Hawking knows even less about philosophy of mind, a critique that is beyond the scope of this review). Hawking does logically reject free-will with some qualification(s).  That is, I agree that a lack of free-will is a broadly logical entailment based on his atheist/scientific naturalist worldview that Hawking endorses (similar to William Provine's reductionism) and applaud Hawking for the assertion.  Only the `open-minded' reader will unpack the ramifications of writing a book allegedly conveying the truth of reality when one lacks free-will, that only portends that the reader out to count TGD as imparting knowledge.  But I have gone too far.<br /><br />Like TGD, the Discovery Channel's program begins with this seemingly explosive statement that \\"philosophy is dead,\\" which is itself a philosophical statement also iterated in the pages of TGD.  It reminds one of the \\"Death of God\\" movement in the 1960's, derived from the death of its predecessors \\"logical positivism\\" and \\"verification of meaning.\\"<br /><br />Hawking's TGD is emblematic of one that has little to no philosophical (let alone theological) knowledge (although these disciplines are taken out of the category of knowledge through mere assumption.  However, many reviews--as evident from the top book reviews--do not present any critiques for a popular \\"science book,\\"  Instead one is left with a litany of \\"that-a-boy\\" pats on the back for what turns out to be a book that fails in its initial thesis, and enters into domains of deep philosophy that neither Hawking nor Mlodinow have any knowledge about contrary to their iterations and alleged arguments.  In short, the TGD not a book about science but an exercise in the philosophy of science and ontology, and an embarrassing one at that (e.g., The first one-third of TGD's is a philosophical discussion about scientific realism and antirealism), precisely because neither author are even acquainted with the basics in these fields, an argument this review unpacks below. No reason to take my word on this issue.<br /><br />According to NYU's Tim Maudlin, one of the most eminent and influential philosophers of spacetime and physics in the world, working at the number one American philosophy institution in the world, rightly begs to differ, not to mention Michael Redhead or D.H Mellor both of whom work at the same universities as the authors of TGD.  In an article in the `The Atlantic' Dr. Maudlin graciously states that, \\"Hawking is a brilliant man, but he's not an expert in what's going on in philosophy, evidently. Over the past thirty years the philosophy of physics has become seamlessly integrated with the foundations of physics work done by actual physicists, so the situation is actually the exact opposite of what he describes. I think he just doesn't know what he's talking about. I mean there's no reason why he should. Why should he spend a lot of time reading the philosophy of physics? I'm sure it's very difficult for him to do.  But I think he's just . . . uninformed.\\"  Maudlin is being too kind.  Sir Martin Rees, a friend of Hawking for 40 years confessed that Hawking, although a brilliant man, knows or reads little philosophy and even less theology, and TGD bears this out in spades.<br /><br />Hawking is not saying anything new regarding the issue of what statement(s) belong in the category of knowledge versus what the category of belief (and here I am bypassing more technical issues in epistemology to stay on point). For example, like Hawking's \\"philosophy is dead,\\" statement, including and science proves God does not exist abound in the public square. In Michio's Kaku's recent CNN interview, he iterates that the discovery of the Higgs actually \\"disproves religion\\" and \\"takes us back to the instant of creation itself.\\"  Both remarks that are patently false on their face and any philosophically informed physicist ought to cringe at such remarks.<br /><br />Since the publication of TGD, there have been a host of materials, essays and books that have grappled with TGD.  This review is influenced from my readings and reflections on TGD, and it also borrows from Walter Ray's \\"Is God Necessary?\\" (2012), Rondey Holder's \\"Big Bang, Big God,\\" John Lennox' debate with Hawking and his book \\"God and Stephen Hawking: Whose Design is it Anyway?\\" (2011), Bill Craig's 2010 article in `Philosophia Christi,' \\"Much Ado About Nothing: A Review Essay in The Grand Design\\" less formal aspects of which can be derived from his website, and a 2011 conference on this issue with both Rodney Holder and Bill Craig [minus Stephen Hawking who was invited to Saint Andrews] once can locate on reasonablefaith.org.<br /><br />I cannot be accused of only reading books by those contrary to Hawking's TGD as I typically read primary materials per the parting advice of my graduate teachers. This can be confirmed by reviewing my on-line profile and the books that I have purchased, which are behind the real-time materials available on either edge.com or ArXiv.org. Unfortunately, there are few informed scientific naturalists that would go out on a limb and defend Hawking's views in TGD (including the publisher that I first thought was backed by John Brockman).  These materials will be referred to throughout the remainder of the review and critique.  Any rebutting or undercutting defectors to the resources cited, and I have read none, have no applicability to the following critique.<br /><br />Part 1: Review/Critique . . .<br /><br />Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow open TGD with woefully arrogant quotes about the death of philosophy (and ultimately God) by announcing that \\". . . philosophy is dead\\" because \\"Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularly physics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.  The purpose of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge\\" (pg. 5).  Again, this is an expression of what counts as knowledge (\\"we scientists\\"), and everything else is outside the domain of our knowledge (defined here traditionally as justified true, belief) is mere simple belief.  But they go further as their project: given the death of disciplines such as philosophy, TGD is a program that tries to assume one of these disciplines under the umbrella of science--the corpse of philosophy.<br /><br />After pronouncing the death of philosophy, the authors begin TGD by iterating their intent to answer three of the most profound questions ever asked, which comprises the remainder of the book:<br /><br />1. Why is there something rather than nothing?<br />2. Why do we exist?<br />3. Why this particular set of laws and not some other?<br /><br />I believe that I mentioned the first one-third of the author's book is a discussion of realism versus antirealism.  After re-reading TGD, I now believe that almost 80% of TGD is philosophical in content and ought to be regarded as a book on natural philosophy versus science.  There is an irony here for atheist/scientific naturalists that are bothered by Christian theist philosopher that utilize the findings of science to strengthen certain premises in arguing for the existence of God. Hawking and Mlodinow are equally culpable in TGD (like many other unnamed atheist/scientific naturalists) of doing the same in answering these questions above.<br /><br />Let's jump right into this philosophical world painted with a `scientific brush' that many of the reviewers are seemingly unaware, or his \\"model-dependent realism\\" (\\"MIR\\").  Let me back up a bit and place this squarely in the domain they claim is dead.  Hawking and Mlodinow are actually espousing a view of philosophy called \\"ontological pluralism.\\"  I first learned of this term from philosopher Dr. William Craig and there is little literature on this view as this is a minority and extreme view.<br />Ontological pluralism states that there is \\"no right answer too many if not most ontological questions,\\" or questions about reality and the nature of reality.  Most ontological pluralists reserve their philosophy what are high level disputes.  For example, let's say someone asks `Does the Sun exist?'  According to the view, there is no right answer but merely different ways of describing reality, none of which is more correct or more accurate than the other (page 7).<br /><br />To use Craig's example, \\"So if you were to ask, `Is there such a thing as the moon?,' the ontological pluralist would say that the question has no objective answer.\\"  Again, if an ontological pluralist is asked, \\"Is there such thing as a moon?\\", they say this question has no objective meaning and that it is both true the moon exists and it is not true that the moon exists.<br />How does this relate to MIR?  Unlike ontological pluralism, MIR is actually more extreme in that Hawking and Mlodinow extend their view to one's `apprehension of the world' and go beyond the ontological pluralist by not only agreeing with their view but alsoadding that our entire apprehension of the world is also part of model-dependent realism.<br /><br />They is to say, (and here I freely borrow from Bill Craig's `Much Ado About Nothing' stated above), \\". . . our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs by making a model of the world. When such a model is successful at explaining events, we tend to attribute to it, and to the elements and concepts that constitute it, the quality of reality or absolute truth. But there may be different ways in which one could model the same physical situation, with each employing different fundamental elements and concepts. If two such physical theories or models accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to be more real than the other; rather, we are free to use which ever model is most convenient\\" (pg. 7)<br />.<br />That is, their skeptical model, in part, is an unconscious way of organizing sense perceptions, which can be refined by scientific theorizing (another assumption without argument). We never come to know the way the world is; all we achieve are more or less convenient ways of organizing our perceptions.  Such skepticism would be bad enough; but the situation is even worse. For these various models are not, even unbeknownst to us, more or less accurate approximations of reality. Rather there is no objective reality to which our models more or less accurately correspond.  How does this relate to MIR?  In short, MIR is full-blown ontological pluralism: there is no objective reality to which our models accurately correspond.  Therefore, it follows that Hawking and Mlodinow are extreme antirealists and TGD is not a pop-science book, but a book on issues that neither author has any clue on which they are writing.<br /><br />What about that scientific brush, such as the one the Discovery Channel creatively tried to paint?  According to Craig and Rodney Holder (see my book review of `Big Bang, Big God'), Hawking and Mlodinow try to distinguish their view from scientific anti-realism by defining the latter as the view that \\"observation and experiment are meaningful but that theories are no more than useful instruments that do not embody any deeper truths underlying the observed phenomena\\" (pg. 44).<br /><br />What Hawking and Mlodinow are describing here, however, is actually positivism, a debunked philosophy of science popular in the 1930s and 1940s. Positivism proved to be untenable in part because of its artificial distinction between observation statements and theoretical statements.  Hawking's anti-realism does not depend on positivism as Hawking and Mlodinow are actually more anti-realist than the positivists, for they not only deny that theoretical statements express objective truths about the world, but they also deny the same of observation statements as well, since even observation is model-dependent.  Again, what they're denying is not just knowledge of the way the world is, but the fact that there even is an objective world to be known.<br />To unpack this with an example from their book, just in case the reviewer finds themselves in disbelief as to the extent of Hawking and Mlodinow's antirealism, one of the most striking examples is derived from their \\"thoughtful goldfish\\"  If a goldfish viewing the world through a curved bowl could formulate a model that enabled it to make successful predictions, then \\"we would have to admit the goldfish's view as a valid picture of reality\\" (pg. 39). Moreover, Ptolemy's geocentric model of the world was just as adequate as Copernicus system?  Hawking and Mlodinow say that Copernicus proved Ptolemy wrong, this is \\"not true\\" (pg. 41).  This has nothing to do with the evidence.  Rather, given MIR, the authors are stating that neither model is objectively true.  As stated in the first paragraph, the authors go even further in contrasting young earth creationism and the big bang theory and claim that, although the big bang model is \\"more useful,\\" neither model can be said tobe more real than the other\\" (pg. 51).  The fact that our observations are model-dependent and/or theory-laden does not imply that we can't have knowledge of the world, including there is no knowledge of the way the world is.  Is this science?<br /><br />Hawking's arguments sound as if we are getting close to Max Tegmark's peculiar ontology as set forth in his \\"Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality.\\"  I have not yet read the contents, but the reviews say enough to make the analogy as Hawking and Mlodinow offer up the that fact that, if we were possible inhabitants of a virtual reality controlled by alien beings, then there would be no way for us to tell that we were in the simulated world and so we would have no reason to doubt its reality (pg. 42).  Here I am reminded and concurrently emboldened by the extremes that physicists/cosmologists go in justifying their naturalism-of-the-gaps.<br /><br />This reminds me Paul Davies' view that in entertaining the possibility of a multiverse, there is no good reason to rule out universes that contain \\"computer simulations\\" of other universes.  What Davies means is that \\"in a multiverse [Tegmark's level II through IV universes] technological civilizations like ours will emerge in some subset of universes, and civilizations more technologically advanced than ours will attain the capacity to simulate consciousness.\\"  Davies continues that it is only a small leap to simulations of conscious beings to simulate an entire virtual world for them to inhabit (pg. 152, quoting pg. 496 of Paul Davies article `Universes Galore: Where Will it all End' from Universe or Multiverse? ed. by Bernard Carr).<br /><br />Even closer, and a view justified by MIR. philosopher and self-proclaimed 'transhumanist' Nick Bostrom's who takes Davies' view a step further concluding that the reader is very likely a computer simulation (Bostrom's `simulation argument')  and we could be the simulations of the human ancestors of post-humans, rather than real humans. Using an argument from probability Bostrom concludes that simulations are likely to be overwhelmingly dominant and that we should conclude that our universe is more likely to be a simulation than a real universe; and, \\"we are therefore not real biological persons but simulated ones\\" (pg. 153).  These are extant options in present cosmology and ones the authors of TGD should readily embrace (see Amanda's Geftar's new book \\"Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn\\" [a well-written book] pgs. 77-84 for more on Bostrom and the defeaters and the authors fascination with this \\"brain-in-a-vat\\" viewpoint).<br /><br />Regarding the virtual reality controlled by aliens, other authors rightly argue that this argument does not exclude the possibility that we have in this case two competing theories of reality--the aliens and our own--and logically speaking one view is true and one is false even if we are unable to tell which is which.  This is science?  Perhaps those reviewers ought to re-read TGD.<br />Hawking and Mlodinow go further in their epistemic/ontological confusion(s), especially when they \\"assert\\" without argument that \\"There is no model-independent test of reality.  It follows that a well-constructed model creates a reality of its own\\" (pg. 172).  Here we have an assertion of a more well-known philosophical view that reality is different for persons having different models, or relativism (not to be confused with relativity).<br /><br />Therefore, for Andre Linde an eternal inflationary model is real.  For Roger Penrose twister theory is the true model.  For Martin Bojowald's, loop quantum gravity model is real.  According to Hawking and Mlodinow, there is no iff and they are all equally \\"real!\\"  How?  Because they claim that the model itself is responsible for creating its respective reality.  But how does this follow when there is no model-independent test of the way the world is.  This reminds me of postmodernist, Stanley Fish, holding up his book \\"Is There a Text on This Class?\\" trying to prove that there is no such thing as authorial intent; hence, no text--a tad self-referentially self-incoherent as the purpose of Fish's book is to make this very point.<br /><br />The analogy is one from negation, but the main point should be obvious to the reviewer--despite the so-called death of philosophy, TGD is a book steeped in philosophy and the authors are positing views from philosophy and the science of philosophy that are regarded as extreme antirealism.  There is no rebutting or undercutting defeater(s) to this argument.  One wonders why there are no endorsements on the back of TGD's cover related to TGD.  I would gather that, despite the selling point (i.e., Hawking's name), the editor likely realized that the most important conclusions are philosophical and not scientific, which is what the remainder of this paper intends to bear out.<br /><br />For the reviewer that may have grown weary long ago, I predict the likely replies will be personal attacks, or to pick out some issue I have raised out of context and try to defeat the argument, despite the fact that Part 1 is an entire argument.  Good luck as this is representative of your worldview, and I am not bashing it with posts to other books or presupposing Christianity in my review.<br /><br />Part 2: The Laws of Nature . . .<br /><br />This section of the review intends to discuss the author's view of a law of nature (pgs. 27-34) and critique the responses three questions they raise (1); what is the origin of these laws? (2) Are there any exceptions to the laws such as miracles; and, (3) is there only one set of possible laws  The next edit/update will follow the end of this argument.  (This critique is not finished and Part 2 will be unpacked within a week).<br /><br />Regarding (1) the authors aver that God established nature's laws, but then they take issue with God's attributes, despite the fact that God's attributes are both well-defined and argued in books by more well-informed atheists.  For TGD's authors, they complain that the \\"God\\" answer is qualitatively equivalent to defining God as the \\"embodiment of the laws of [nature).\\"  The authors are historically mistaken on this point which only lends credence to the argument that they lack basic philosophical knowledge.  They state that it was Descartes--views that actually belong to Spinoza--that posited that nature's laws are freely willed by God.  In fact, Spinoza regarded god and nature as the same, which is in contradistinction of even the most basic books of philosophical theology and the attributes of God as having attributes, both communicable and incommunicable, that distinguish God from nature.  This evidences both their lack of philosophical knowledge and theology, and should be an embarrassment to anyone that endorses TGD as you likely fall into the same category.<br /><br />Regarding issue (2) the authors build their house on sand regarding the issue of \\"miracles,\\" a cuss word for the naturalist devoid of understanding first class and second class miracles, as the \\"real crunch\\" (and we are not referring of Aristotelian causes).  The writers provide a perfect example of such fallacious thinking.  First, in responding whether there are miracles or lack thereof [which are never defined], they look back to the Christian's response and definition of (1) which is borderline incoherent and one they answer in the negative.  So what's the rub?  Pretend I am a deist (like Anthony Flew before he passed [please bypass the statements of senility and that his book was ghost written, which are false and irrelevant]) believing that God established a Newtonian clockwork universe and choosing not to intervene.  By this mere locution I have already dismantled their argument as, broadly logically speaking, there can be no \\"real crunch\\" in providing an answer to (1) by God, and (2) by iterating \\"No!\\"  If the reader does not understand this minor point, thenTGD is the perfect philosophy book for you.  Pardon the incivility, but the village atheists and the \\"professional reviewers\\" can move even an educated Christian into \\"what are you thinking mode\\"?\\"<br /><br />So why do Hawking and Mlodinow answer (2) negatively?  There answer, like many reviews, that presuppose metaphysical naturalism, is that \\"science requires it.\\"  They wrongly state that the \\"scientific naturalism that Laplace formulated is the modern scientists' answer to questions (2). [That is] in fact, the basis of all modern science, and a principle that is important throughout this book.  A scientific law is not a scientific law if it holds only when some [ultra mundane] being decides not to intervene\\" (pg. 30). (I will ignore the metaphysical and methodological issue until my nest post).<br /><br />In response, (i) I would assume the authors' of TGD's intellectual caliber would know their own history, but TGD does not bear this out as Laplacian determinism is not the basis of modern science, even as the historic/ontic footnote the authors iterate.  That is, Hawking and Mlodinow regard the indeterminacy characteristic of quantum physics as ontic.  And if nature is indetermistic the determinism of Laplacian's Newtonian determinacy fails. Laplacean determinism contradicts quantum indeterminacy, which brings one to the second objection; (ii) the authors of TGD regard the indeterminacy of as ontological (not epistemic) characteristic of quantum mechanics (an issue beyond the scope of this review), then Laplace's determinism contradicts their initial assertion as there is a contradiction between their affirmation of Laplacian determinism and quantum indeterminacy.<br /><br />The (iii) criticism is borrowed from Bill Craig; namely, the authors confuse \\"determinism\\" with \\"naturalism.\\" Hawking and Mlodinow present an argument against first-class miracles via a personal ultra mundane being.  As Craig states, [t]heir argument against the intervention of a supernatural being is an argument for naturalism, not determinism.  Quantum indeterminacy is acceptable because it is naturalistic, where as miracles involve supernatural agency.\\"  Craig continues that that their claim is false: that scientific laws would not be \\"laws\\" if they hold only when a supernatural being decides not to intervene, which is false as the laws of nature describe the behavior of physical systems in the absence of any supernatural intervention.  \\"Were a supernatural agent to intervene, the predictions based on the laws would not hold precisely because non-natural factors, not envisioned by the laws would not hold precisely because non-natural factors, not envisioned by the laws, have entered this picture.  The laws thus have implicit ceteris paribus [\\"all things being equal\\"] conditions: they describe the behavior of physical systems given that no supernatural agent intervenes.  If such a being does intervene, the natural law is not abrogated, since it describes the behavior of the system only under the assumption that such a being does not intervene\\" (`Much Ado About Nothing,' pg. 413) [emphasis added].<br /><br />And (iv), it would have been more respectable if the authors would have, at a minimum, mentioned that there are numerous alternatives to determinism (a minority view).  The unfamiliar reader would have no idea that these issues are multitudinous; hence, there is no free will, is nowhere close to the end of the discussion contrary to the plethora of new books that make the try and make the same argument, but all presuppose materialism.<br /><br />Part 3: Free Will . . .<br /><br />If this sounds confused, and it is, let's leave aside these issues for the moment and reflect on their views related to free-will.  In short, TGD argues that as people live in the universe and interact within the universe that scientific determinism must hold for people (pg. 30), humans are nothing more than biological machines and free will is an illusion (pg. 32).  (i)This is what Plantinga calls a \\"philosophical tar baby.\\"  That is to say, if we lack free will then why or how do the authors think that anything they have iterated in their book is actually true, especially given that everything is merely a product of blind physical causes?  Their argument against free-will is based on neo-Darwinism.  According to the authors \\"If we have free will, where in the evolutionary tree did [free will] develop?\\"  This would be a great place to unpack Alvin Plantinga's \\"evolutionary argument against naturalism\\" but it is beyond our review (although I can envision the so-called enlightened thinker at pains to try and rebut this latter assertion).  If so, then good--welcome to the culture war.<br /><br />The authors do present an argument/assertion, which Hawking has written in previous materials: free will is simply an illusion because neurosurgeons can stimulate a person's brain in a manner to produce a desire for one to move their limbs. (ii) This statement about creating a \\"desire\\" ought to have theistic, atheist, and agnostic philosophers scratching their head regarding these broadly logical entailments as Hawking has included immaterial mental states.  That is, to say, stimulating the brain can cause one to raise their arm is a standard deterministic view, but to argue that stimulation creates desires is a wholly different assertion altogether.<br /><br />(iii) Whether having free will has nothing to dependence on specification where one obtains free will in the evolutionary process, and such a remark is close to a categorical fallacy.  The standard neo-Darwinian \\"just-so\\" story regarding consciousness is that free will arose when the brain evolved in complexity creating consciousness, qualia, intentionality, etc.  For the initiated, such a sweeping statement is a mare's nest I invite the initiated to challenge, although it has nothing to do with TGD's arguments.<br /><br />As this paper is being published in another context, I will provide the prompt to obtain the article in about 1 monthbe more real than the other\\" (pg. 51).  The fact that our observations are model-dependent and/or theory-laden does not imply that we can't have knowledge of the world, including there is no knowledge of the way the world is.  Is this science?<br /><br />Hawking's arguments sound as if we are getting close to Max Tegmark's peculiar ontology as set forth in his \\"Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality.\\"  I have not yet read the contents, but the reviews say enough to make the analogy as Hawking and Mlodinow offer up the that fact that, if we were possible inhabitants of a virtual reality controlled by alien beings, then there would be no way for us to tell that we were in the simulated world and so we would have no reason to doubt its reality (pg. 42).  Here I am reminded and concurrently emboldened by the extremes that physicists/cosmologists go in justifying their naturalism-of-the-gaps.<br /><br />This reminds me Paul Davies' view that in entertaining the possibility of a multiverse, there is no good reason to rule out universes that contain \\"computer simulations\\" of other universes.  What Davies means is that \\"in a multiverse [Tegmark's level II through IV universes] technological civilizations like ours will emerge in some subset of universes, and civilizations more technologically advanced than ours will attain the capacity to simulate consciousness.\\"  Davies continues that it is only a small leap to simulations of conscious beings to simulate an entire virtual world for them to inhabit (pg. 152, quoting pg. 496 of Paul Davies article `Universes Galore: Where Will it all End' from Universe or Multiverse? ed. by Bernard Carr).<br /><br />Even closer, and a view justified by MIR. philosopher and self-proclaimed 'transhumanist' Nick Bostrom's who takes Davies' view a step further concluding that the reader is very likely a computer simulation (Bostrom's `simulation argument')  and we could be the simulations of the human ancestors of post-humans, rather than real humans. Using an argument from probability Bostrom concludes that simulations are likely to be overwhelmingly dominant and that we should conclude that our universe is more likely to be a simulation than a real universe; and, \\"we are therefore not real biological persons but simulated ones\\" (pg. 153).  These are extant options in present cosmology and ones the authors of TGD should readily embrace (see Amanda's Geftar's new book \\"Trespassing on Einstein's Lawn\\" [a well-written book] pgs. 77-84 for more on Bostrom and the defeaters and the authors fascination with this \\"brain-in-a-vat\\" viewpoint).<br /><br />Regarding the virtual reality controlled by aliens, other authors rightly argue that this argument does not exclude the possibility that we have in this case two competing theories of reality--the aliens and our own--and logically speaking one view is true and one is false even if we are unable to tell which is which.  This is science?  Perhaps those reviewers ought to re-read TGD.<br />Hawking and Mlodinow go further in their epistemic/ontological confusion(s), especially when they \\"assert\\" without argument that \\"There is no model-independent test of reality.  It follows that a well-constructed model creates a reality of its own\\" (pg. 172).  Here we have an assertion of a more well-known philosophical view that reality is different for persons having different models, or relativism (not to be confused with relativity).<br /><br />Therefore, for Andre Linde an eternal inflationary model is real.  For Roger Penrose twister theory is the true model.  For Martin Bojowald's, loop quantum gravity model is real.  According to Hawking and Mlodinow, there is no iff and they are all equally \\"real!\\"  How?  Because they claim that the model itself is responsible for creating its respective reality.  But how does this follow when there is no model-independent test of the way the world is.  This reminds me of postmodernist, Stanley Fish, holding up his book \\"Is There a Text on This Class?\\" trying to prove that there is no such thing as authorial intent; hence, no text--a tad self-referentially self-incoherent as the purpose of Fish's book is to make this very point.<br /><br />The analogy is one from negation, but the main point should be obvious to the reviewer--despite the so-called death of philosophy, TGD is a book steeped in philosophy and the authors are positing views from philosophy and the science of philosophy that are regarded as extreme antirealism.  There is no rebutting or undercutting defeater(s) to this argument.  One wonders why there are no endorsements on the back of TGD's cover related to TGD.  I would gather that, despite the selling point (i.e., Hawking's name), the editor likely realized that the most important conclusions are philosophical and not scientific, which is what the remainder of this paper intends to bear out.<br /><br />For the reviewer that may have grown weary long ago, I predict the likely replies will be personal attacks, or to pick out some issue I have raised out of context and try to defeat the argument, despite the fact that Part 1 is an entire argument.  Good luck as this is representative of your worldview, and I am not bashing it with posts to other books or presupposing Christianity in my review.<br /><br />Part 2: The Laws of Nature . . .<br /><br />This section of the review intends to discuss the author's view of a law of nature (pgs. 27-34) and critique the responses three questions they raise (1); what is the origin of these laws? (2) Are there any exceptions to the laws such as miracles; and, (3) is there only one set of possible laws  The next edit/update will follow the end of this argument.  (This critique is not finished and Part 2 will be unpacked within a week).<br /><br />Regarding (1) the authors aver that God established nature's laws, but then they take issue with God's attributes, despite the fact that God's attributes are both well-definedand argued in books by more well-informed atheists.  For TGD's authors, they complain that the \\"God\\" answer is qualitatively equivalent to defining God as the \\"embodiment of the laws of [nature).\\"  The authors are historically mistaken on this point which only lends credence to the argument that they lack basic philosophical knowledge.  They state that it was Descartes--views that actually belong to Spinoza--that posited that nature's laws are freely willed by God.  In fact, Spinoza regarded god and nature as the same, which is in contradistinction of even the most basic books of philosophical theology and the attributes of God as having attributes, both communicable and incommunicable, that distinguish God from nature.  This evidences both their lack of philosophical knowledge and theology, and should be an embarrassment to anyone that endorses TGD as you likely fall into the same category.<br /><br />Regarding issue (2) the authors build their house on sand regarding the issue of \\"miracles,\\" a cuss word for the naturalist devoid of understanding first class and second class miracles, as the \\"real crunch\\" (and we are not referring of Aristotelian causes).  The writers provide a perfect example of such fallacious thinking.  First, in responding whether there are miracles or lack thereof [which are never defined], they look back to the Christian's response and definition of (1) which is borderline incoherent and one they answer in the negative.  So what's the rub?  Pretend I am a deist (like Anthony Flew before he passed [please bypass the statements of senility and that his book was ghost written, which are false and irrelevant]) believing that God established a Newtonian clockwork universe and choosing not to intervene.

But I really fell for Katniss and her dilemma(s).  It was a fantastic story that was funny, scary (not bad scary) and sad.  I look forward to reading Catching Fire which I will start tonight.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this backpack as a birthday gift for my boyfriend. I got the response I had hoped for - \\"I love this bag!\\" - a few weeks later. He can fit 5 lenses, 2 flashes, 1 camera body, and tons of miscellaneous camera/photography stuff in it. The padding is substantial, I don't think he's worried at all about things shifting or banging into each other. And the straps are plenty long - he's not a little guy but he doesn't have to have them extended all the way to wear it comfortably. My only objection is to the bright yellow \\"Amazon\\" emblazoned on all of the zipper pulls, but I guess you'll get something similar with any brand. All in all a great bag and a great value for money.

I love this season and I will buy all the other seasons soon.<br />The four disks are magnificent, and the case and the warping; amazing.<br />I would totally recommend this awesome series for comedy/fun drama fans around the world, and to purchase any of the seasons ONLY from Amazon.com because they are the best in providing these great products and with the best guaranties ever.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The whole album is excellent.  I love every single song on it.  I found myself kept replaying her songs.  I am obsessed with her story and her voice.  Good job, Susan.  I think this album is worth more than the price you have offered on amazon.  Excellent job done by Susan Boyle.  I am very happy for her.  She never gave up her dream of becoming a singer despite of her learning disabilities.  What an inspiring story.
B003YBNRHU|4.0|I've been a fan of these guys since I was in high school about 35 years ago. This CD is the real deal. The band sounds great. Just like they did all those years ago. They have returned to what made The Captain And Me and What Were Once Vices great CD's. Music is so bad these days it's great to enjoy some new music from real musicians.
1933492953|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moXWRJRJGZ75SG]]There are probably no other books around that covers composition with emphasis on storytelling as well as Framed Ink. This is a whole book devoted to the subject, as compared to other books (on storyboards) that usually have only one or two chapters.<br /><br />Although the illustrated examples are mainly movie composition, the techniques can be applied to animation, movies and even graphic novels. Every technique comes with a concise breakdown. You get to understand how and why shots are framed in a certain way, or how to create compositions to create a certain mood. There are also tips on lighting and continuity.<br /><br />Over 200 beautifully illustrated examples are included. And they are really good examples. Just by looking at the examples alone, without even reading the commentary, you already get a good idea of what's happening.<br /><br />Marcos Mateu-Mestre has distilled his 20 years of experience and knowledge into an accessible package you shouldn't miss out on.<br /><br />This is the essential how-to book for storytellers, or for anyone who needs to put images on screen or on paper.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />-<br /><br />You can check out more of his work on his website.<br /><br />-<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog.

B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Why do some insist on boxing in a great artist like Clapton? This is some of the best stuff he's ever done  and it's different while still being solid Clapton. Yeah, there are few less than five star moments  but the I don't know why some simply expect carbon copy performance  and style. Robert Plant gets the same stiff shoulder. These are the fans who need to stick to greatest hits and collections.  Music being highly subjective, I see the majority still have great taste in music.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|I liked \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" and his albums with Jimmy Page so after hearing the lead song \\"Angel Dance\\" all the way through (notice it's being heavily promoted), I thought this album would be worth giving a try.  Uh, no.  After \\"Angel Dance,\\" it offers some sparks but just never really catches fire. Too many slow and mid-tempo numbers, too much country and the songs just aren't that memorable. My recent benchmarks are the Black Keys \\"Brothers\\" for southern blues rock and Robert Randolph's \\"We Walk This Road\\" influenced by the southern gospel blues traditions, either one of which blow this one of the water for roots oriented music.
B003HC8I5M|2.0|I bought this CD expecting Phil collins to put his \\"pizazz\\" into it, I mean come on, Mowtown?! Right down his alley...right? Wrong, his vocals on this CD, at least in my opinion sound almost kareoke like. The songs chosen are great, but it seems he just put the sound tracks on and said, \\"Hey...I think I'll sing along!\\" Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE Phil Collins fan, but it just seems his last few album efforts, including this one, have been lack luster. Come on Phil...You can do better...put some effort into it! If you like Motown the songs are great choices, but if you expect to be \\"wowed\\"...sorry.
B003TXKSWK|3.0|I'm with those who are disappointed with this album. From the concept I thought it could be a dynamite album.  But it's only half good, thanks to poor song selection and mostly ho-hum arrangements.  With all the great anti-war and social consciousness songs available from the 60s and 70s, they picked a weak crop.  \\"Compared to What\\" is a of a classic choice, but this arrangement doesn't compare to the rave-up Les McCann/Eddie Harris version on the Montreux live album.  It's just ok.  \\"Wake Up Everybody\\" is another classic song and at least in this case the album delivers a worthwhile remake, thanks to the vocals of Melanie Fiona and the inclusion of a rap break.  But otherwise, I'm just not that impressed.  The low point comes when people in the car beg me to turn off the screaming repetition of \\"They shot me in the shoulder!\\" from \\"I Can't Write Left Handed\\" and I'm happy to oblige because I can't stand it either.  I had an inkling I wouldn't like this album when I heard it was being promoted through Starbucks.  By and large I haven't liked the company's taste in music.
0385342039|5.0|Having read the numerous 'shopaholic' genre of Kinsella's novels, I was gratified that the description for 'Twenties Girl' did not follow that formula.  I admit that after the first few pages, I was not drawn into the characters or plot.  Just a fit further in, however, Kinsella showed depth and intrigue with the characters and plot - much more so than in her previous novels.  I came to be very involved with the story line, even thinking about it when I wasn't reading.  She made me believe in and empathize with Sadie, the ghost.  More importantly, she caused me to think more about our aged population, and what might be in the heads of those rows of wheelchairs in nursing homes.  Well done, Sophie!

B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have been using the Griffin adapter in my 08 Infiniti g35 but the wide \\"wings\\" on it made it worthless with my iPhone 4 in the apple bumper. I bought this hoping the extension would overcome the poorly designed bumper but it was still too thick to make a proper connection. I had to file out (with a metal file to eliminate the excess plastic) the 30 pin connector area on my bumper  to accommodate the adapter and after I did this it works perfectly. Not too wide and not too thick make it the perfect adapter to listen to my iPhone in my car and charge at the same time. The modification to my iphone case was easy to do and does not impair the look or the protective factor of the bumper. I will post pics if anyone wants.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Why all the negative reviews for this masterpiece? What do people really want or expect out of a film these day's? Like the majority of these negative reviewers think that they could write, produce and direct something better! It's especially ironic how this sequel is on par with the first film and everyone just loved and adored that one but hate the new one. That makes a lot of sense. You have the same, if not even better amazing acting ( especially in Robert Downey Jr. ). You have an even better villian and ending action sequence better than the first film. There is continued awesome character development there as well. Seriously people? I find it amusing and hilarious that all these folks out there always cry for a movie like this to be made, with the amazing acting and storytelling. But as soon as this type of film is delivered they just have to step on and squash it. This kind of attitude seems to be the new fad and way of life this day and age. You see, I enjoy movies for what they truely are, MOVIES! Entertainment. Not a real way of life. We as humans are flawed and so are the films we make. We are never going to be perfect. People waste too much energy striving to achieve something that does not exist, perfection! Anyway's, I loved the movie. It was pure awesome entertainment. Cant wait for the 3rd installment. Enjoy!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This was beautifully written and acted!  I have read several books by Temple Grandin, including Thinking In Pictures.  This is by far the most honest portrayal of a person like Ms. Grandin who is diagnosed with ASD.  I'm blessed to have a child with ASD and am constantly seeking positive stories of people who live with ASD.  Bravo, to Claire Danes who played Ms. Grandin and Julia Ormond who portrayed her \\"warrior\\" mother.  I so identifed with Ormond's honest portrayal of a mother who strived for help for her daughter; leaving no stone unturned!  I laughed and cried.  Thank you to all the educators as portrayed by David Strathairn who work to \\"unlock\\" the true potential of these students.  Catherine O'Hara's (Grandin's aunt in the movie) shows how trying yet rewarding it is for family to support and participate in their lives. I bought an extra copy to share with school, family, and friends.  God Bless Temple Grandin!

B000002KB8|4.0|This is my first review and I feel that I owe it to these amazing musicians to say something. I got this album probably some time in 2008. I was trying to expand my horizons with music, and I always wrote off Black Sabbath as a band whose music all sounded the same, like AC/DC. Sorry AC/DC fans, but I can't appreciate their music. This all changed when I heard the song Supernaut, which is on Vol. 4. I had never heard a Black Sabbath song like that before. After utilizing the magic of the internet to hear some more music, I took the plunge and bought all the Black Sabbath albums up to Never Say Die!, when Ozzy was ejected from the band (I don't really like Ronnie James Dio, either).    That's 8 albums all together, and the first four are great. There's plenty of hard riffs and a lot of variety, and there are more mellow songs as well. People are always surprised when I play them Planet Caravan. The other four albums do have some good songs on them, and other songs just aren't my style, but they really changed their sound overall over those albums, so I don't dislike them because they were experimenting.    As far as this album is concerned, it's definitely great. It's not their best, but it's got a blues/rock sound to it with some good jazzy chords thrown in here and their. They really aren't a band that plays a few power chords throughout a song. The only thing that I don't really appreciate about the album is that they run a bunch of songs together on one track throughout the album. So, while there are only 5 tracks listed there are really 10 songs. The songs actually run together anyway, but it would be nice to be able to skip to a song that I want to here that's on a nearly 15 minute track.    If you are at least intrigued by the band and don't own any of their music do yourself a favor and at least go listen to some of their music that isn't on the radio and see if you like it. If you like 70's rock and metal you'll probably like Black Sabbath.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|WOW!!<br /><br />The people that make a living out of the ignorance of others might feel threatened by what this film portrays.<br /><br />As a \\"window to the past\\" this work may not be very accurate or complete.  I believe -Sarakani- \\"nailed it\\", (as it is said here in the states,) with his keen observations like the use of candles or carriages or Hypatia's age, please read his review at the beginning of this list.<br /><br />Overall I think this film is fantastic.<br /><br />Alexandria was the physical terrain where truly the debate between devotional faith and logical reason consolidated.<br /><br />Logical science belonged to the Hellenic descendants and faithful religion to the emerging Christians. It was as rebellion against the ruling mind.<br /><br />This movie is about the place in history where religion and science started to struggle.<br /><br />The killings was done by those who immediately beneficiated from them.  The powers that became never got physically stained with Hypatia's blood so nothing can be proved. Maybe a, lost in time, discreet absolution behind a wall or two would be the link.<br /><br />This movie is to stir up the mind.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|On Remakes:  People come into these remake movies and freak out because its not exactly like others before it, but if it is like others before it they freak out because it's unoriginal.  Darned if you do, Darned if you don't.  Personally i think that if your going to film a remake then you'd better be able to add something fresh to the story.  Robin Hood does this while keeping my favorite parts.    Casting & Acting:  Personally i think this is a very well done movie, the character of Robin Hood really came alive throughout along with superior casting for the rest of the movie as well.  Normally Kate Blanchett is fine but never has she had a performance that i've really liked.  She was perfect for Marian.  So casting and acting was wonderful.    Setting:  Wow.  No matter how many times i see Ridley Scott recreate the past it still amazes me.  Believe me when i say that this setting not only sparks the imagination and pleases the eyes, but it also pleases the mind with superior accuracy.  I couldn't ask for more.  And i am fairly picky with these kinds of things.    Overall:  It isn't perfect, but i have yet to see a truly perfect movie.  And no it's not as good as gladiator but yes it is close, and yes it is more then worth buying.  The last thing i think needs to be said is this: There are a lot of good movies out there and a lot of them are fun, but there aren't nearly as many that are both.  So thank you Ridley Scott and crew.

B002OR18HQ|5.0|If there were two American bands that could be put in a class with The Beatles it would have to be The Beach Boys and Creedence Clearwater Revival.  Like The Beach Boys these guys were practically just kids and they put out some of the best music ever recorded ...and did so in a four year time span, incredible!<br /><br />Fast forward approaching 40 years, John Fogerty returns to The Royal Albert Hall with his band.  This ain't no crass \\"oldies\\" tour, it peels the paint from \\"The Hall\\" as well as your house.  If wine gets better with age how do you explain John Fogerty?  Creedence Clearwater Revival was an anomaly then and, I guess, John Fogerty is now because this is his finest hour and we get it recorded for prosperity on DVD.<br /><br />You may not like every song as much as \\"Commotion\\", but you'll likely gladly listen to them all without need of the FFW button because this concert hits the right \\"set list\\" keeping the viewer fully invested.  The sound is clean and full and the band is crack.  Kenny Arnoff hits the skins with vigor and timing second to none (ghost of Gene Kruppa playing R&R) and Billy Burnette tastefully yangs John Forgerty's Ying (John Fogerty is a guitar wonder) with the rest of the band no less capable.  I won't pick out any song, because the order makes everything work together for a real \\"over-the-top\\" whole.<br /><br />If you like CCR/John Fogerty then you must get this DVD as it simply the best he's ever done and it is one of the best DVD rock concerts period.

B0034BW9CO|5.0|There are times where talent seizes to amaze you and for that one moment in time you say, \\"Whoa!\\" That is exactly how I felt when I first heard Prince Royce's self titled album. I don't want to add any more hype or over hype the album and add an incredible amounts of expectations to anyone who might read this and say, \\"Hey, from what people are saying this kid is a Prodigy.\\" But in all reality when you take a close listen to not only the lyrics but the production in which the album is put together you will be blown away.     Granted there is only 10 tracks on this album which isn't as much as one would like. Yet, in these 10 tracks Prince Royce was able to fuse a Spanglish mix of R&B and Hip-Hop, which in an ironic twist resulted in \\"Classy\\" Bachata style. \\"Classy\\" in the sense that he blends Violins, Violas, with the classic Spanish guitar sound all sandwiched between some R&B/Hip-Hop rhythmic beats. A lot to describe in precise detail but you get the point, it's something refreshing, it's the Evolution of Bachata and he is the future.    \\"Stand By Me\\", is his first single, which gave him the recognition that is well deserved. But I would have to agree with Compay, in retrospective \\"Stand By Me\\" was probably his fifth best song on the album, with songs like, \\"Tu Y Yo\\", \\"Rechazame\\", \\"Mi Ultima Carta\\", and my personal favorite due to the message the song sends and the perfect production in \\"Corazon Sin Cara\\". The last two or three tracks of the album can be consider club songs but that's whats so good about the album. . the diversity of it, keeps you on edge. What's even more mind blowing is Prince Royce wrote all of his songs and co-produced the album when he was only 19/20, he recently turned 21, making the expectations for his next album unreal. . where does he go from here? It will be exciting to see. Finally, what makes a good album is when you can listen to it and not skip a track and thats what this album made me do. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!

0439023513|5.0|I don't know much about these books except that my son, who has not been a real reader before, discovered them because his English class required the first in the series.  Since then he has been a big fan.  It's wonderful to see him devour a book and eagerly anticipate the sequel.  I never would have expected it from him - so these books are very engaging and have really opened him up to the world of reading.  Thank you!

0525951652|5.0|Like a lot of fans of Ken Follet who read and loved Pillars, World Without End, Eye of the Needle, and so many of his other great works.  Fall of Giants didn't let me down.  This is a great novel.  As for the argument that the price of the electronic version is too high, then I have to say that the Kindle was probably not meant for you.  I bought the Kindle for convenience and to have a great selection with me when I'm on the road.   As J. Paul Getty once said \\"If you can count your money, you don't have a billion dollars\\".  Whether money is a factor for you nor not I'd say that it's never a bad idea to make use of your local library, and then give the author the rating he's really entitled to.

006145205X|4.0|The author of the fine book `Genome' takes on the highbrow economic establishment and documents that capital creation and capitalism works to improve all normal lives in the system.  The debate of trade as a zero-sum game should surely be debunked by now, if not, then a sturdy nail is now in place with the publication of `The Rational Optimist - How Prosperity Evolves'.  Even though you will read in the media daily that the world is worse off or getting worse, it is most defiantly not the case but is getting better and at a faster pace as I write.<br /><br />Even on the environment front, it is very fashionable these days to talk and protest about such dire predictions about fossil fuel doom, but again, the environment is probable in the best shape it has been in a century or more.  Why you may ask, mainly do to urbanization (also another false ghost) with the relief it has provided to the countryside via reduced carrying capacity of arable land.<br /><br />Humans have the unique capability within the animal kingdom to have a collective cumulative human knowledge.  (True ants do too, but they have their own social structure as they are mostly sisters)  Thus thru the eyes and in evolutionary terms, once capita l, trade, and trust are added - a somewhat auto-catalysis evolves to make life better and to construct/build more things folks want. Will prosperity continue to evolve?  It appears so as the world becomes more globally interconnected and more specialized thru division of labor.<br /><br />Other fine books with similar theme:<br />[[ASIN:0393061310 Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]] by Jared Diamond<br />[[ASIN:0393318885 The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor]] by David S.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|... But I am very pleased with this album. Natalie Merchant has created a very diverse album, with every song having a different musical style. The fact the songs come from poems is very interesting also, in that she managed to attach a different musical style successfully with each poem. My favorite song, oddly enough, is \\"The Janitor's Boy\\" which was put to a sort of 40's swing style of music. Well worth the price for the double CD set, which includes information on each poet featured. If you like Natalie Merchant then this album is a must buy.
0143038419|4.0|This was okay. The first and last parts of the book best held my interest. I think it involves a lot of self-indulgence on the part of the author. I enjoyed the humor.
0345505387|4.0|Graphic novel - just as advertised.  I'm not sure why there are so many reviewers who don't understand the concept of  a graphic novel -- basically, it's a cartoon for adults.   I am a big fan of the Outlander series and found Exile entertaining. It was like going down memory lane -- the over all gist is there, but the details are a little fuzzy.     I think this graphic novel was quite a risk for Diana Gabaldon.  She has a huge number of loyal fans, each have a distinct idea of what Jamie & Claire would look like. Obviously we can't all be satisfied. Plus, it's a summary like a Cliff's Notes version of Outlander.  There are huge gaps in details and story lines.  If it was as detailed as Outlander, it would weigh 50 pounds and would have never been done.   It's not going to completely satisfy our itch for a new novel. It's just for fun.  Think of it as an accessory to the series.      It's been  several years since I read Outlander, but the graphic novel seems to bring in a few new threads or prespectives.  While not complete, I'm glad I read it.

B003BW6846|5.0|There's been speculation as to the origin of these Russian CD Maximum label Rolling Stones + Bonus Tracks reissues.  One person suggested they're dubbed off vinyl.  Clearly that's not the case.<br /><br />Here's my theory:  The albums proper are clones of high-quality Japanese CDs, with bootleg bonus tracks appended.  The bonus tracks are without doubt Stones material.  The back tray liner says \\"All information on this CD from private collection by Grigoryan Sergey.\\"  These bonus track boots are probably many generations removed from the masters and often sound like it.<br /><br />The Russians have an interesting approach to copyright law--they don't recognize it when they don't want to.  It's doubtful the Stones see a cent off these CDs.<br /><br />Send some copy to a printer and you're in business.  I compared the front artwork of the CD Maximum \\"Sticky Fingers\\" with the authorized U.S. version.  The CD Maximum cover is actually a shot of the original Lp cover (which had a working zipper).  The back tray artwork is generic with \\"type-written\\" track listings.<br /><br />Should you buy the Russian releases?  If the bonus material interests you.  And if it's true that each release is limted to 500 copies (that seems unlikely), they won't be around  for long.  The Rolling Stones should mine their archives for material like mono mixes, good tracks left off classic albums, and the better vintage live tracks.  That would eliminate the market for CD Maximum.  Unfortunately, the Stones didn't do that with the recent \\"Exile On Main St.\\" reissue.<br /><br />As for \\"Sticky Fingers\\" itself, it's one of the Stones's better albums, though the acoustic is dry.  That's what happens when you close mike everything and over-dub ad infinitum.
0553386816|3.0|not the usual quality i expect of john grisham - his novels are so-o-o  much better than these short stories - disappointing
B003XNTTYY|3.0|I haven't yet finished the book. The story looks great so far, however the number of typos found in the kindle edition is very annoying (5-10 in the first 3 chapters only).  It looks like nobody proof-read it.
0786956291|2.0|While this box set tries to entice new players into the world of Dungeons & Dragons, you the buyer, has to beware that this is NOT the game itself.  This box set contains enough rules and items to take you through a couple of the enclosed encounters, in sort of a 'pick a path' type adventure setting.  If you are a player from back in the day, trying to get the Basic (Moldvay/Mentzer) set and have some fun again...Steer clear of this.  If you are a new player who wants to play the game that Vin Diesel, Seth Green, Mathew Lilliard and Michelle Rodriquez play...Steer clear of this.    The problem with this box set is that it will bog the new player down about halfway through the character creation process.  With all the additional rules needed for ability checks and other game mechanics, it feels more like a tactical miniatures game with tons of charts and rules to cross check and reference.  New players unfamiliar with the game will lose interest in all this geek-ness of checking charts, rolling for every action under the sun and having to figure out tactical maneuvers on top of it.  My guess, real new players will drop this fast.    You would be better served to look around on Amazon/eBay for the original D&D rule sets from the 1980's and enjoy a looser, fast paced adventure game that not only explains the game better, but wont bog you down with a mortgage on your house trying to collect and buy all the 4e books and supplements.    This box set is for people that played 3.0-3.5 version of D&D and want to even further busy up their gaming session by diving into the minutiae that is 4e.  It is NOT for totally new players.    Finally, if your reading this far, thank you for indulging me.  This set has a nice box, complete with cover art from the 1980's 'Mentzer' set (highly recommended) and as for quality, that is about it.  The box IS NICE!  The interior game pieces...Not so nice.  The rule books are printed on something that feels so flimsy that I doubt it will last past one session.  Water or any other stains will ruin this, I am betting even the printing will run.  Everything else looks like it was done on the cheap, but the dice are not so bad for a beginners set.  You will want to Google Game Science dice of course for real, big boy grown up dice.    Due to the cheap interior contents and the confusing myriad of rules, I cannot recommend this set to the totally novice player.  If you are a 3.0/3.5 player trying to get into 4e, this might be of interest...After all, its a cheap way for you to realize your better off sticking with 3.0/3.5.
B000077VR3|5.0|The opening scene of this movie is a frenetic, whirling burst of lights, colors, and music! But try and stick with it because it is one luscious movie!<br /><br />As the story goes, Christian, an impoverished writer, comes to Paris and falls in with Toulouse-Lautrec and the Bohemians of Montmartre, which leads us all to a merry romp at the Moulin Rouge. Christian meets Satine, the club's star and a beautiful courtesan.

0385736002|4.0|Warning: This review is written by what the average reader of this book would consider a gray haired elderly type. I am, however, a life-long reader of fantasy and I have read at least a respectable number of contemporary YA titles, not all of which were penned by Ms. Rowling. Still, I'm hardly the target audience for this book.<br /><br />If I'd stop reading halfway through I would have given this book two stars. I'm giving it four because of the content in the last half of the book. I began to get interested about half way through, and I'll confess I read perhaps the last third in two increasingly avid gulps.<br /><br />The complaints I see here from the other reviewers all seem fair. I too was initially intrigued by the idea of reading about \\"real world\\" alchemists, and felt the book never really delivered on that promise. I also felt that the author tried to overwhelm us with a myriad of flashy mythological creatures rather than developing the characters or the plot. Please compare with the CS Lewis, Tolkien or Potter books which mix a significant amount of character development with the generous helpings of flash. Nevertheless, I can picture a much, much younger version of myself really enjoying all the magical creatures for their own sake. And there is some \\"real world\\" (ie educational) value in meeting famous mythological characters that are often referenced in adult literature.<br /><br />Despite the slow start, sticking with the author to the end turned out to be a good idea in this case. Especially since this is a relatively short book, and I wasn't bogged down for too long. Three things happened to make the second half of the book more interesting than the first.<br /><br />1) The author stepped away from \\"telling\\" everything from a distant third-party point of view and started \\"showing\\" us what was happening as if we were actually witnessing it, rather than hearing about it from several removes.<br /><br />2) A glacial accretion of detail about the main characters allowed their outlines to slowly emerge from the rubble of facts about flamboyant mythological creatures and take on a separate, and not unappealing, life of their own. This is especially true of the \\"good\\" characters in the book, and less true of the villains.<br /><br />3) The plot in the second half of the book was more tightly drawn and more interesting. Rather than just throwing another creature at us, the author dug in his heels and took the time to let the story develop at a more reasonable pace. Finishing up with a few good scenes really does leave one with the impression that the overall book was good, even if portions of it dragged.wly emerge from the rubble of facts about flamboyant mythological creatures and take on a separate, and not unappealing, life of their own.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Recently widowed Walt Kowalski is a tough, bad tempered retired autoworker who is estranged from just about everyone in his life. Other than his deceased wife Dorothy, Walt's only other source of affection is his 1972 Gran Torino.<br /><br />Despite Walt's stubborn efforts, his old neighborhood is in decline and under siege by a group of young Hmong thugs. A failed attempt by his neighbor Thao to steal the Gran Torino unwittingly brings Thao and Walt together. Led by his articulate and bright sister Sue, Thao must make amends by working for Walt. This leads somewhat predictably to a friendship. It is, however, the consequences of that friendship that creates the tension and drama of the movie. Clint Eastwood stars and directs this stirring film.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|A foolish, newly-minted young king whines about the problems left him by his predecessor's Crusade to take back Christian lands that were violently conquered by Muslim hordes.<br /><br />Instead of taking common sense steps to fix things and rein in spending, he determines to spend more, goes on the warpath against his already overtaxed barons to tax them further, thinking their coffers are bottomless. Later, upon learning of an impending foreign attack, and facing rebellion from his barons, he refuses to make peace and rally them against that threat; instead, he goes on the warpath against his own countrymen.<br /><br />A ragtag group of citizens bands together to oppose the tax collectors and the corrupt, overtaxing government. (Note: My impression may be wrong. Nico1908 says: Erm, the \\"ragtag group of citizens\\" that opposed King John's taxation and ultimately persuaded him to sign the Magna Carta in 1215 were the barons, not the peasants, churls, serfs, etc. (see comments)).<br /><br />Well, let me tell you I AM SICK AND TIRED of all these ANTI-OBAMA movies!!! :-)<br /><br />It's a bit long and plodding. On the bright side, it has a strong pro-gun (well, pro-sword) and pro-torture message. Go Ridley!

B001GCUO5M|5.0|In the twilight of his career director Martin Scorsese continues to amaze.  Not content to rest on his laurels after wresting the elusive Oscar (if he ever pursued it in the first place) Scorsese pushes and challenges himself and creates a work unlike anything in his canon.  Though the influence of Kubrick and Hitchcock are apparent \\"Shutter Island\\" is unique and original and totally Marty.  I could also see the influence of Shyamalan before he fell out of favor.  It would behoove Shyamalan to view this film so he can get his career back on track.  \\"Shutter Island\\" is a complex film that demands close attention sort of like a jigsaw puzzle where the true picture isn't apparent until all the interlocking pieces are connected.  I may have to qualify that because the ending does contain a certain level of ambiguity.  Along with \\"Inception\\", which coincidentally stars Leonardo DiCaprio as well, this may be the best picture so far this year.
B003HFFVDQ|4.0|As soon as the first sounds emerge you know you are listening to The Chemical Brothers. This album is true to their style. It is a little pop and instantly likeable.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I loved this movie - I loved the special effects, the world that was created, the philosophy of the Na'vi. What is sad, though, is the reality behind the fiction. The movie adequately presents the reality of American military aggression and arrogance, the \\"we like to kill people\\" attitude that is prevalent in some of our military, the idea that killing people is just \\"collateral damage\\" and no big deal. It realistically portrays our country's very real attitude that American might is right, that because we have the big guns, we have the right to rape and plunder whatever and wherever we like. It shows our disgusting imperialistic arrogance which, if we don't change soon, will destroy us - is destroying us. While we pour most of our money into war and war-goods, our country crumbles and our people go homeless and hungry. This film has an important lesson for us: that we do not own the world, that might is not right, that guns are not the way to peace. I hope we learn it, and soon.
0446615625|2.0|This was my second attempt at a book by David Baldacci, who I know is very popular.  Sadly, I still don't know why that is.  This novel, while interesting in its many sides of American/Muslim relations has so many impossible to believe moments and coincidental happenings that belief is totally suspended.  The climatic ending actual reads like '80s GI Joe cartoon.  That's probably too harsh but that's the first thing I thought.  Another problem was the title/series itself is the \\"Camel Club\\" although the members save one are almost purposeless.  So, I'm glad I read a novel by a popular author to see if I agreed and I simply don't.  Skip it.
0810988232|5.0|I am an owner of both the Faeries Oracle and the Heart of Faerie Oracle by Froud.  I also own many Doreen Virtue decks and a few other oracle decks.  I must inject my enthusiasm for both Froud decks as they are the most accurate of oracle decks that I own other than Colette Baron Reid's.  The Froud decks are so accurate that I even find them better than Tarot.    With that said.  The Heart of Faerie (HoF) hasn't been getting a lot of splendid reviews.  I find this deck to be very accurate, as accurate as The Faeries Oracle (FO).  HoF has beautiful illustrations brighten by color.  FO was a deck I never really liked using because the faeries were so... sublime.... almost scary looking... unappealing to my tastes but when I opened up the box I could FEEL the energy of this deck.  Just hated having to read through the gosh long explenations for each card and having some of the uglier cards come up during a reading.    HoF the faeries are more attractive, there's more colors to the cards.  The meanings are less complexly written.  They are all upright though (no explenations for reversed cards in this deck as Wendy Froud isn't into reversed as in comparison to Jessica Macbeth).  So for those who loved the accuracy in the FO but not the illustrations then the HoF is for you.    Mindful, the HoF deck is highly tuned to romantic inquiries.  The FO is for every aspect of your life or your querents.    I am doing what another reader is doing and combining the two decks to give readings which is easily done as the cards are of the same size... but not the same backing.    These two are the best oracle decks out there.. I don't know how they did it... twice!

At first he didn't seem interested so I took the movie and watched it. I was blown away at how good it was. I am a 63 yr old woman and loved this movie. I told him and he watched it and agreed totally. Great entertainment especially if you lived through some of the politics that happened in the past, or know them from watching the history channel. Great mix of entertainment and reality.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book! I have read it countless times. I keep it by my bed all the time. I have not read the Kindle version but you should DEFINITELY read this book!

B0029LHW68|5.0|This album is their best yet.  Fantastic idea to include thousands of fans on the recording.  It sounds different than the other albums, but still stays true to the 30 Seconds to Mars style.  Perfect flavor.
B0017KP93U|5.0|Radiohead had a concert in Santa Barbara in 2008 that is available as a download from All Songs Considered site and it would have been a dream if the contents of that concert were the songs in this CD's but it's not the case. It is still worth having this as a radiohead fan. \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\", \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", and especially live \\"True Love Waits\\"(favorite track)should be enough to make up for the fun with the concert. The thing is no one stopping anyone from having both so enjoy Radiohead as I always will.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|Not as good as their latest album.  I enjoyed about half of this CD.  Can't explain it.  Some of the songs just didn't appeal to me.

0345505387|4.0|The positives:  *Murtagh is one of my favorite characters.  His sense of humor is ironic and sharp.  I like the edge that his view brought.  *I actually liked the Kenneth story as it made it feel more like a comic book.  *The depiction of Claire was fabulous if a little busty.  *I think it covered all the main points of the story as well as any comic book of this length could.    The Not so positives:  *The depictions of all the Scotsmen were so similar it made it hard for me to figure out who was who.  In my mind they looked quite different from one another but similar enough to look like family.    *It was too short!  I really would have enjoyed expounding on certain areas.  *While I liked Murtagh's view I would have liked Jamie's more or a third person omnipresent.      Overall:  This was fun!  I definitely think Gabaldon fans should purchase this book for their collection.  While it would be hard to find any one depiction of Jamie to please everyone the young many in book was quite sexy so if you allow some flexibility to your fantasy I think you will enjoy this book too.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I wasn't really sure what I was getting into when I first hit the play button.  Was this going to be like a Michael Moore film?  Would it be as boring as most monotone lectures are?  And, will it satisfy MY demands for evidence?  When the DVD arrived from amazon, I was taken aback by the packaging.  Which is nothing like what the image on amazon represents itself to be, as its not the typical plastic DVD case with a cardboard box slip cover.  The package could best be described as a greeting card with a slot for the CD.  Don't let this discourage you, the case is made from 100% recycled material and is really small and light weight.    The movie opens with a beautiful and serene nature scene which has a strong relaxing effect.  Gore puts forward a convincing argument, and lays out the scientific evidence in such a way that the truth is inescapable.  Using iWork Keynote, Gore built a beautiful keynote which helps the data come alive.  At no time was I bored during this 1.5 hour movie, not once.  In fact the ending came upon me suddenly.  There can be no question about it, no doubt remaining to the question of Global Warming, once this presentation is viewed.    When I was in grade school (I'm 27 at the time of this writing), I was taught that Global Warming was a threat, but that it was a threat posed to successive generations.  A lot has changed since the late 80's early 90's.  With the new scientific data propagating from all over the globe, it's conceivable the next generation will have severe difficulty surviving on this planet if we don't change NOW.  The evidence presented by Gore is as irrefutable as the Holocaust and even more foretelling.    Thank you..... President Gore.
B003HGKJ3W|4.0|I have a feeling that the suits at Warner Brothers probably had to take some stomach settlers after A-Ha delivered \\"Scoundrel Days,\\" their second album. \\"Where's the \\"Take on Me\\" hit,\\" they probably whimpered? Because unlike the sugary Duran Duran pop that A-Ha's first big hit delivered, \\"Scoundrel Days\\" was dark, menacing pop, and while the video that made the band stars dressed them up as pretty boys, this album made them look thoughtful and more than a little dark.<br /><br />That change-up was something I really enjoyed about this album. A-Ha may have come from a power-pop start, but they evolved quickly into a pop band with a dark center. Even with the crystalline falsetto of Morton Harkett, the band could not disguise the anguish of the title track or the atmospheric dread of \\"Cry Wolf.\\"<br /><br />They also sound more mature. \\"The Swing of Things\\" has smooth glide to it, and should have been the first single. \\"Soft Rains of April\\" is a gorgeous waltz that closes the album with a soft goodbye. I enjoyed the first a-ha album, but songs like the ones on \\"Scoundrel Days\\" made me a fan.<br /><br />PS: The bonus tracks are OK; other than the live tracks on disc 2 and the extended versions on disc on, they're negligible. (Caveat; I'm not a big fan of demo-versions.)
B003INBOEM|5.0|I really liked this movie.  The story line and script  appear to be well written.  The action fight scenes were spot on to say the least!  The sound from the Blu- Ray really fills my living room.  I see that the Action Director Sammo Hung went to great lengths to ensure excellent choreography in the fight scenes.  I remember Sammo in the movie \\"Enter The Dragon\\" with the opening fight scene with Bruce Lee.  The movie \\"Ip Man\\" sends a good message in family values,  loyalty,  dignity,  respect,  honor and friendship.  Overall a fine movie for all action viewers to see.  By the way ,  i had to wait almost a whole month to receive the movie. It only came from Chicago,  ILL..  It's too bad the this movie did not open here in the States.  If it did it must have been in limited markets.

1416550534|4.0|Grace Bradley has kept a secret for over 75 years, one that she hoped to take to her grave.  However, in 1999 when Grace is 98 years old and living her remaining time in a nursing home, all that changes.<br /><br />An American film director named Ursula is making a movie about Riverton House, the place Grace began working as a housemaid, like her mother before her, just before the First World War. Ursula's interest is to find out more about an incident that occurred in 1924, when a poet, who was a guest there, committed suicide at the lake.  Grace is the only person alive who was there on that fateful night.<br /><br />The story moves from past to present as Grace recalls her duties serving the aristocratic Hartford family, and their three children David, Hannah and Emmeline. It is the daughters that are key in this story. Grace is especially close to Hannah, who was the same age as Grace, but she never forgets her role --to serve the family.  Although the sisters were present on that night, they never spoke of the incident. Grace has been haunted by the incident ever since.  Bit by bit the full story is revealed through Grace as she relives the past.<br /><br />The House at Riverton is a haunting story with a Gothic feel. The story is multi-layered and the characters multi-dimensional. Descriptive and atmospheric, the story felt almost like a confession of sorts by the narrator. Told in a series of flashbacks, Grace unburdens herself of the secrets of the past, leaving no stone  left unturned.<br /><br />I liked this book, but did not love it. It really is a terrific debut novel, but I think from all the discussion and gushing reviews over the last two years, I was expecting to be wowed, and that did not happen.  Some of what was revealed seemed a bit predictable, so for me that pushed it down a peg. Despite this, The House at Riverton is still a worthwhile read that should appeal to readers who enjoy historical novels and Gothic suspense.
0312243022|1.0|Everything that I felt about this book has already been said in other reviews. It was contrived, it was juvenile, it was all of that. The characters all basically have the same voice: Cunningham's. Also, this is another example of a gay man whose creation implies that he believe a gay man can have only one sort of soul mate:a woman. Perhaps it's some kind of internalised homophobia. I found the whole thing rather creepy and sickening myself.
B003DT19F0|5.0|So what!? I'm a 45 year old heavy diesel truck mechanic. I'm pretty normal, but I liked the movie. Yes it's weird, get over it. Some kind soul posed a low resolution copy on you tube (before they yanked it!) but it was on long enough for me to see it. And it turned out to be a good movie. Now I want a high res copy so I'm ordering the DVD. I like to encourage good work when I see it and corporations like Disney only understand one language (money). So I'm going to speak it's language and buy the DVD. Maybe in the future they'll expand the series to cover how Tinkerbell meets Peter Pan.

B002ZG983M|5.0|This movie has it all, but mostly it is funny as heck. Even the \\"serious\\" moments are funny. Typical kid wants to be a superhero, gets a wetsuit, and is ready for action. Kick Ass is supposed to the be star of the movie, but really Hit Girl steals the show. The action, silliness, violence, comedy, and music all come together.<br />The movie had a huge chance of being a flop. I really think the director is genius. If it wasnt for his direction, the movie would be missing key elements, that all put together correctly, make it a really good film.<br />Keep in mind, even though it seems kind of comic bookish, the movie is R rated and is very violent so if you are a parent of a 13 year old or younger, you may want to watch it before they do to see if it is suitable.

0439023513|2.0|First off, I adore the first 2 books beyond words.  I love those books and recommend them to anyone who will listen.    Mockingjay seemed like it was written by a completely different author.  I couldn't put down the first 2 books, but it was so odd that I dreaded picking up Mockingjay.  The book was a lot of \\"huh?\\" \\"what?\\"  \\"now who is that?\\"  \\"what just happened?\\" \\"where are they again?\\"... then the last chapter tried to tie everything into a pretty little box.  It was bizarre!    Sorry to be harsh, but if you loved the first 2 books, don't read this one.  It will ruin the series for you.

0345505387|2.0|I own and have read all the Outlander novels 2 times.  I preordered this book and couldn't wait to see what else  Claire and Jamie were up to.  Sadly this is not Jamie's story but Murtagh's and it's not very good. The story starts with Murtagh  seeing Claire come through \\"the stones\\", ye ken? and rushes  through the story to Jamie rescueing Claire from the whipping at the witch trial and heading home  to Lallybroch. The graphics are not consistant and Claire and Jamie look different from one frame to the next and are difficult to recognize throughout the story.  The graphics are for the most-part dark in colors and not what I was expecting.  Save your time and your money and just reread  the books.  I was surprised at how much I had forgotten when I read them through a second time.

0596522347|5.0|I appreciated the way this book is laid out. I love the pacing, the typography, the visual aids and most of all the content. It makes sense that a book about presentations is presented well, but Nancy Duarte goes the extra mile and hits a grand slam with Slide:ology!    The case studies are perfectly relevant and efficient teaching aids for the reader. You decide if this is a pro or con but there are a LOT of case studies in this book.    As someone that works with a business that uses PowerPoint for nearly EVERYTHING this book armed me with a few other tools to help guide the \\"higher-ups\\" to a more successful design.    Chapter 3, Creating Diagrams is particularly strong as it helps expand your concepts of diagramming all sorts of different concepts. Hundreds of simple thumbnails to get you started; or use as is for an end state.    Chapter 12, which hardly could be classified as a chapter, is Manifesto: The Five Theses of the Power of a Presentation. SHORT, and AWESOME.  Bottom line: this book takes an everyday presenter and transforms them into a designer! The world would be a better place if everyone that was ever going to make a PowerPoint presentation sat down and read through this book FIRST!

B003Y2XI8W|2.0|i bought this album because of all the 5-star reviews that were written about it. but was very disappointed once i heard the entire cd. i loved the movie, 500 days of summer, with all of its tracks including sweet disposition on this album. however, i can't stand his high pitch vocals in most if not all of the songs. there is not much range in his vocals and there are only, maybe 3, good songs on this cd. i tried and wanted to like this cd but just couldn't.
0618918248|4.0|A lot of people get fired up about this book, so I wanted to read it to try to see what the fuss is about. And from many of the reactions I've seen to Dawkins, I had the impression that he must be veritably livid himself - all but foaming at the mouth as he spits cruel, cruel attacks at his poor (religious) victims.<br /><br />That really isn't what I found in The God Delusion.<br /><br />Of course, Dawkins doesn't write with the cool detachment and (extreme) caution of a good philosopher; he's a scientist, and he writes with a scientist's frustration in the face of a too-common dearth of reasoned thought and scientific literacy in lay society. Yes, the frustration shows through, but I don't see why anyone should fault him for that. People have committed gross atrocities in the name of \\"God\\" -- that is rightly very frustrating. But the book is not written in the style of a polemic; it's a reasoned argument, and it has the feel of such at almost every point. The humor is a nice break now and then, and he does get a bit quote-happy sometimes - but the quotes are interesting, so I enjoyed them as well.<br /><br />One thing I noticed was that I had to keep reminding myself that Dawkins was using the word \\"God\\" in a specific way; early in the book he explains precisely what he means by \\"the God hypothesis\\" and thereby what he means by \\"God\\". In a nutshell, that is a supernatural intelligent being that designed and created the universe and everything in it. This is a basic (many religious people would probably want to add to it) but common definition (this is kind of an essential - gets the essence of it - concept of God that many, even across religions, would agree is true of their God).<br /><br />(Side-note: there is a philosophical/logical problem with the notion of a supernatural entity fiddling around with the physical universe, and that's why I had to keep reminding myself that Dawkins was arguing against God as commonly conceived - otherwise I wouldn't see why he's cold as he is toward agnosticism.)<br /><br />Of course, if you think \\"God\\" is some kind of pattern in nature (or is nature itself), then Dawkins' arguments aren't going to work against your \\"God\\" - but you're also not talking about the God described in the scriptures of the major world religions, you're not talking about a personal God who created the universe and listens to your prayers and gave commandments and rules etc. to prophets ... in short, you're not talking about the kind of God that most people talk about, or go to church to worship, or believe works miracles from time to time, or in whose name people have committed atrocities. That is the kind of God that Dawkins is arguing against.<br /><br />And he does a fine job of it. Not a perfect job, but then I doubt I'd say that anyone has done a perfect job of arguing their point on any difficult and debated position. In the chapter on morality, it felt clear that he is not a moral philosopher - but that's probably a good thing, as moral philosophers can't even manage to agree on whether moral statements (like \\"it is wrong to kill\\") mean anything at all. Dawkins OTOH is writing for people in the real world. ;)<br /><br />His chapter arguing that religion is akin to child abuse sounded like it would be too extreme, but on reading it, a lot of what he had to say made a lot of sense. I grew up in an area with a lot of Amish, and Dawkins does strike pretty hard at them - but it seemed fair, and his condemnation of the rest of us for helping to forcefully perpetuate the culture seemed more so. I know the feeling of lament that we often have about old traditions dying out (particularly when they aren't our own traditions); but I also have to wonder why we should lament the fading of outdated traditions more than we lament the limited life possibilities available to the actual people who are trapped unwittingly or even grudgingly in those traditions. Dawkins rightly calls us out on this.<br /><br />...I still don't understand why people get so angry about The God Delusion, though. It's an argument, and the great thing about arguments is that if you disagree, you can try to dissect the argument and prove it wrong (or show why your own argument is stronger or more cogent). You can learn a lot from an argument whether you think it's right or wrong - so why get mad?ugh.

B000FC2PKG|5.0|A sniper does his job and kills a husband holding a gun on his wife and son which begins a a story of incredible suspense. The story takes many turns and you go from hating then feeling bad and then hating the wife.

0743298039|3.0|The beautiful writing entices and at first draws the reader into this pseudo-19th century type Gothic tale, but it is so rambling, so dense that I wanted to quit after 50 pages, then after 100. Despite this, I did finish the book but was never fully immersed in it.<br /><br />The heroine is dull and whatever the reader learns about her and her emotions, repeated in case we don't catch them, is told to us. The story goes on and on with a mystery that doesn't appeal except for a few incidents at the beginning. Mainly uninteresting characters, easy-to-see-through plot twists, except for the final one - so improbable that this reader felt misled and annoyed rather than pleased to have the overall mystery explained.<br /><br />So many references to 19th century literature, Jane Eyre in particular, that only the least literate reader would fail to see the connection. Despite the author's mellifluous language, it is marred by the occasional clich&eacute; such as \\"I froze\\" to show that after all, the heroine does have normal human reactions.

B003AO1SVS|4.0|I was very excited to get this CD yesterday, instantly popped it into my car stereo, and got the dreaded FAIL message. WTF??!?! Is this because of that fancy schmancy color-changing covering on the CD? Has anyone else had issues? I tried both sides just in case (yeah, it would be kinda hard to mistake the bottom of the cd for the top.)  Well, it's playing on my computer now, and I love it, but I'd REALLY like to know why a car stereo wouldn't recognize this (a Jetta, specifically).
B003UYUQZW|3.0|Several years ago, before the Matrix and Crouching Tiger and their ilk, the special effects of this film would have been astounding. Today, they're clich&eacute;. The fast cut video editing, with its obligatory stop action/slow motion sequences, are old hat and can sustain interest for only about 60 seconds -- yet the scenes go on and on and on ... and on. Since there is little in this movie to recommend it other than SX, they become its great weakness instead of its strength.<br /><br />The plot ... if you can call it that ... is paper thin and the characterizations are on par with the cartoons and video games that inspired the film. The acting is average, with Kingsley sleep walking through his role (what was he thinking????) and the others going through the paces with minimal effort, which is what the dialogue demanded of them.<br /><br />There are some WONDERFUL visual feasts; vast desert panoramas and other-worldly city-scapes. There is also a bit of comic relief that allows the picture to stop short (just barely) of taking itself too seriously. But there just was no emotional connection to the film. I know that sounds odd when I'm talking about this type of movie, but do you remember the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie? How you laughed at that, and really cared what happened to those characters? Did you laugh a lot at this? Were you in suspense about the outcome? Did you care what happened to these people? I didn't, and that's why it was, for me, a big disappointment.
0143118420|5.0|I thought this book was really honest and something that I can relate to. This is exactly how I felt - well not the marriage - I think I am okay there - but the whole thing about the pressure of having children - just cause u get married and have a husband. The pressure you feel from people who tell you how you should live your life- when they are too afraid to live theirs the way they want too. I must thank this author and applaud her for having the courage to do so. I have been married for 12 years and chose not to have children - and in spite people telling me what to do - I have decided to do things in my life the way I want to. Don't be afraid all you women out there. It is okay to listen to your heart. It is okay to live your life the way you want to.   I keep doing my mini-eat-pray-love sessions and I seem to be able to live full happy life this way - do what makes you happy - Some of these people who have written these bad reviews - don't realize how important it is for people like Elizabeth to come out and tell everyone her story and motivate others. There have been so many suicides and murders committed because people think others should live as per their views(actually not even theirs - but the way they have been told and brainwashed)   I am lucky to have the courage to live my life my way - and I would like to motivate others to do that too. I hope more people come out like this and help others. that is what we need.   And People - pllllease do not underestimate the importance of meditation - it is a wonderful tool to get in touch with your inner self - gain confidence and freedom and perspective. Don't let these insecure people tell you that going out and trying to find yourself is a bad thing - It is a great thing to do not just for yourself - but for everyone else - More people need to get in touch with their hearts - Do it - don't be afraid of what you find - gradually you will develop the strength to be with what you see and what you are - it can betough - but the only way to liberation.

It bores into your soul, and resonnates with that 5 yr. old child we once were, and/or the parent that we are now, igniting that primordial fight or flight instinct born from absolute Fear.  My pragmatism has returned, so now I write. But there remains within me the frighteningly dark and ugly knowledge...that monsters are real.    A completely original premise, brave and authentic, but the power and brilliance of this novel lies not in what is written, but rather in what is BETWEEN the LINES! With the convincing innocense and naivete of a child, Jack narrates this story--without telling us the story at all!  Ex: Hidden in the wardrobe, impatient to be with Ma, Jack passes time counting the squeaks of the bed, his teeth = Ma is being raped by her captor; \\"Ma is switched off today,\\" = Ma is so depressed and desperate that she lies on the bed, almost catatonic... Donoghue has brilliantly enlisted the reader to bring this monster to life; it is our personal knowledge, and imaginings of evil and helplessness, that tells the real story.      I've read some criticism about the supporting characters being sketchy and undimensional.  But this tight focus on Ma and Jack separated them from the others, and created the claustrophbic imprisonment from the real world. There are some inconsistencies with Jack. One page has him spouting 6 syllable words and discussing scientific principles, then he digresses to a rudimentary explaination \\"something comes out of her mouth,\\" when Ma vomits. But, Jack is from a make-believe world, where consistency is an illusory anchor to sanity, provided by Ma. Does the same Ma that spends days in bed unable to function set out to systematically create a little genius?  Does she cognitively educate Jack, or does she just say aloud everything she knows,a frantic challenge to herself, like prisoners of war remember and repeat times tables.     If this was the Book Olympics I would be holding up the 10 sign. A fabulous book, but it is hard to read and is not for everyone.  I'm glad I read it, but almost feel weighted down by the the haunting story.
0393970116|4.0|\\"Howard's End\\" is a typical \\"English\\" novel that takes the tried and true form established by such authors as the Brontes and Austen, and subverts it in subtle and intrinsically 20th Century ways. There is romance, heartache, a house in the country, a clash of the classes, and large quirky families with characters both loveable and deplorable.  Yet while Forster includes all the standard elements in \\"Howard's End\\" (named after the aforementioned house in the country- a typical English author move), the themes and tone of this story takes the tradition in a new and thought-provoking direction.<br />  The title refers to a house in the country owned by the wealthy and, in many ways, out of touch Wilcoxes.  Early in the novel, the Wilcoxes cross paths with a pair of intellectual, forward thinking sisters, and despite having nothing in common with each other, the sisters and Wilcoxes begin a series of encounters that lead to the eventual collision of their personal lives.  On the fringes of the action, yet existing at the very core of the novel and its themes, lurk the Basts, a lower working class couple who's very lives and livelihoods are essentially dependent on the actions of both the Wilcoxes (the rich aristocracy) and the sisters (the compassionate liberals looking out for the poor).  These three sets of typically English characters collide and interact in a series of coincidences that never seem forced (thanks to the brilliance of Forster), and move the plot in what, when all is said and done, turns out to be an inevitability.<br />  Completed in 1910, \\"Howard's End\\" is very much a book of the 20th century. Themes of socialism and class struggle, while never explicit, underlie the actions and dilemmas of the characters.  Forster's writing is brilliant, and the conversations between the \\"bleeding heart liberal\\" sisters and the cold hearted business oriented Wilcoxes capture the \\"english novel\\" vibe so dead-on that at times Forster can almost be accussed of mocking them both.  In a lesser author's hands, this novel could have been nothing more than farce, but Forster walks that fine line between satire and homage and produces a masterpiece that in many ways signals the end of the \\"English aristocracy\\" and its stranglehold on English fiction.<br />  This is a complex, worthwhile read!em both.

B002NZK5TG|5.0|\\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" is one of those entertaining movies that adds up to just plain fun.  Even if you're convinced a musical is the least favorite type of flick to sit and watch, the old Broadway stage genre soon grabs one's attention with a plot and subject matter that amounts to a purely frivolous \\"getaway\\"-type of bizarre entertainment that sports an all-star cast.  The plot is well-known and has been reviewed so many times, it certainly is not necessary here.  \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" is a winner and will remain a classic for generations to come.  Everyone should see this DVD at least once!

B002NB8N3A|4.0|A lot of people have been complaning about this cd, well its true, its not that great, but she made it to the top. People should understand that a lot of this new music is targeting teens and not smart adults, and thats why the LYRICS lack a lot. And its no different in other languages. Its just a bussiness I would say, targeting the people who buy it the most. With that said, my personal opinion about this album is good. Maybe like junk food, but who doesnt like junk food once in a while?

The Rising.<br />I LOVE artists who ar not afraid to GROW....Now, I DO wish i could see Bruce<br />as he is in this LIVE set...filmed in London's Hyde Park and Some extra footage from Glastonbury....WOW! The way this DVD is filmed brings the Boss right into your<br />home! I felt like I had the BEST seat I've EVER had for a Springsteen concert.<br />The opening song a cover of \\"London Calling\\" is Awesome....that is for Bruce!<br />I wasn't sure when I had heard it was on there, but its GOOD. The song selections are all VERY GOOD. I felt like I was THERE. The Big Man never looked as good recently....He is in fine form as is Little Steven, et al....<br />  I'd LOVE to see Bruce tour the upcoming Darkness on the Edge of Town re-release.<br />Its good to see him in FINE FORM here and the band and the man seem to ROLL ON!<br />The music and the man are Eternal!

1601251505|5.0|Im not a fan of 3.5 or any d20 system but this is what most people are playing in my area so its what im currently playing. The book is well made with great art. If you like fantasy d20 then you should love this item. The changes from 3.5 are logical and help the flow of the game. There is alot of crunch but thats what this style of game is about and pathfinder core does it very well.
1594488843|5.0|I've read a substantial amount of books by various authors like Malcom Gladwell, Seth Godin, John C. Maxwell, Peter Drucker and as well as many solid academic research like Mintzberg and Rokeach. However, Drive by Daniel H. Pink is a game changer because it connects with the common man. While I won't give away the content (not because I don't think it's important but because your eyes must make that connection), Daniel Pink did a brilliant job of integrating years of wisdom, academic research, and insight and gave the audience a masterpiece. By the way, Malcom Gladwell's books resonate brilliancy. In my personal opinion, Drive by Daniel H. Pink trumps ALL of his.
0786956291|4.0|This is a well made starter for anyone wanting to try out roleplaying. It has a choose your own adventure style tutorial which is a good idea. The cards,tokens and maps are simple but decent. This is not going to give you any real value if you already own the 4th edition players handbook. For the price it is a great value for beginers but I actually would suggest that people just buy a used copy of the phb ang get alot more bang for your buck.

B002SQFZ68|2.0|I'm a big fan and was excited about this.  After watching, I was extremely disappointed.  The video is great but the audio sucks.  This is really just a really expensive CD.  THe music is too studio like and does not have a live/concert feel to it.  THe audio is not even on par with Bon Jovi's Wembly Stadium album.  Definitely not worth it.
0553805371|4.0|Traditionally, science never claimed to deal with \\"why\\" questions. Philosophers, and many scientists, seemed content with relegating scientific concerns exclusively to the realm of \\"how.\\" Science, so this claim went, could never address life's meaning. Answers to perennial questions such as \\"why are we here?\\" or \\"why does anything exist at all?\\" would never appear in microscope lenses or in the atom splitter's detritus. Times have of course changed. \\"Pure thought\\" and \\"pure logic\\" have given way to mathematical and theoretical inference and observational confirmation. \\"The Grand Design,\\" a book that, 400 years ago, authorities would have thrown into the flames - and maybe its authors as well - attempts to answer the \\"big questions\\" in the framework of scientific theory. Bold claims follow. Right away the book proclaims, without hesitation, that \\"philosophy is dead.\\" Even a cursory examination of modern academic philosophy suggests this, but the statement nonetheless resonates with some arrogance. In cosmological terms, yes, current philosophy provides as much value as zero Kelvin produces heat. But it is by no means \\"dead.\\" It has simply moved into different realms. The book even quotes some modern philosophers, and not altogether disparagingly, later on. Regardless, few feathers will ruffle by pronouncing that the love of wisdom has expired. But the book's other \\"bold\\" claim made headlines. According to the authors, current theory has rendered a creator, or \\"God,\\" as redundant and extraneous. We no longer need the old Deus ex Machina to explain the origins of all that exists. This will shock no one who has followed modern science. But rarely has this message been splattered so copiously across headlines. Some in the Christian community accused Hawking and co-author Milodinov of trying to increase sales through religious sensationalism. Maybe the publishers had these sections juiced up to help sales in today's stagnant book market? Maybe. Who knows? Truth is, this book would sell with or without any reference to God. But doubtless the controversy (or pseudo-controversy) caused a few more to fly from shelves. But focusing on these minor points detracts from the meat of the book: M-theory.<br /><br />We came from somewhere. An obvious enough statement, but the answer still eludes us. To answer the question \\"why there is something rather than nothing\\" the book first provides science history lesson. By starting with questions around the rule of law and debates concerning the nature of reality, the first few chapters culminate in a worldview called \\"Model-dependent realism.\\" According to this view, we can only know the world through interpretive frameworks. No single objectivity exists. Some may cry \\"relativism\\" here, but models or frameworks must correspond to observation. Nonetheless, multiple frameworks may agree with observation. How do we clear this up? To use the book's example, Copernicus did not prove Ptolemy wrong, he just provided a simpler model of reality. \\"Classical\\" physics posited one, and only one, reality. This new view embraces anti-realism and allows multiple realities. And not only multiple realities, but multiple histories. Quantum physics, particularly the thoughts of Richard Feynman, argues that the subatomic world acts in counter-intuitive ways. The double-slit experiment's famous interference patterns introduced these startling revelations. Add the implications of Relativity theory to this and the universe takes on surprising new qualities, including the possibility of multiple dimensions. Here the book introduces M-theory (what \\"M\\" stands for remains unclear), allegedly the only candidate for a new \\"theory of everything,\\" though it actually comprises many theories. The M-theory universe has 11 dimensions, many of them \\"rolled up\\" beyond everyday detection, and multiple universes with different laws. And \\"multiple\\" here means billions and trillions. Quantum fluctuations produce a myriad of universes out ofnothing. Yes, M-theory says that we ultimately come from nothing. Well, the universes do, humans derive from the nuclear ovens inside of stars, where fusion of hydrogen and helium eventually produces carbon, which gets blasted out when the star erupts as a Supernova. But the universe has to form \\"just right\\" for life to exist. The final few chapters show our precarious position. Astronomer Martin Rees calls us the \\"nuclear waste\\" of the stars. If some elements of our universe were adjusted even slightly, life as we know it would never have arisen. So obviously the universe was designed for us, right? Not according to M-theory. Countless universes bubble out of the void. Some collapse, some expand. Some are conducive to life, others not. We just happen to inhabit one of the universes that supports life. Billions of others don't. And in a nearly infinite sea of universes, the chance that our \\"special\\" universe would develop becomes more than a remote possibility, in fact it becomes almost inevitable. This reduces the \\"miracle\\" of our existence down to quantum fluctuations, again out of our primordial origin, nothing. M-theory has not yet accumulated enough observational confirmation to dominate cosmology. If it does then \\"we will have found the grand design.\\" Time and experiment will tell.<br /><br />\\"The Grand Design\\" makes the inaccessible accessible. Though the book gets technical in places, especially in chapter 5, general readers will have little difficulty completing it. Some people may get too wound up in the theological implications of M-theory, but that issue remains marginal throughout. This is not a \\"science vs. religion\\" book, though some of the extended \\"God\\" passages may create that false impression. Though provocative and effective for stirring controversy, the book didn't really need to mention the \\"creator\\" implications of M-theory. Such implications are implicit in the theory itself and arguably irrelevant. Nonetheless, those looking for a great introduction to contemporary scientific cosmology will find a great example in \\"The Grand Design.\\" Short, readable, entertaining, even funny in places, the book will hopefully garner a large readership of the scienfically curious but uninitiated. Those with a physics or cosmology background will likely learn nothing new here. But general readers will ingest droves of fascinating information, regardless of M-theory's ultimate standing or feasability. And who knows, maybe we did come from nothing?

B003XWEQ1G|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Russell Crowe, Ridley Scott, and this genre in most instances. When this movie came out, I knew I had to watch it! To my dissappointment, the movie felt as though it dragged on and on without a singular purpose. Other reviews have mentioned it and I completely agree that it is boring, not purely for the lack of action, but also for the lack of character development and a clear vision.
B002ZG9968|1.0|Here is a back-up plan for you - have any other movie on stand-by to watch insted of this one.  Some of the adjectives that came to mind immediately after watching this movie:  \\"asinine\\", \\"ridiculous\\", \\"stupid\\", \\"painful\\" and \\"major psychotic hatred.\\"      Thank the lord for Redbox because I would have been seeking someone's head on a platter for making me spend more than a dollar on this disaster.    Examples are a good way to support someone's opinion of a movie, so I will gladly offer up a few.  Okay, the dog who ambles around on a cart for his back legs - stupid, pointless, distracting and it served no purpose to the story.  Although I found the part about it wanting to grab main character Zoe's just used pregnancy test like a bone, swallow the part that indicates the result, then later vomit it up (with a nice close up of the vomit) believable.  Oh wait - no I didn't.    The single mothers support group.  Everything about them was super way over the top annoying, and not in a good way.  I'm not going to waste time typing about these characters; other than to say if ever there was a time for a crazed gunman to enter a room and start firing at random, any time that support group would have appeared on screen would have been perfect.    The first date dinner in that courtyard.  Stan had to walk to Zoe's house, wait for her to fight with her dog to the get pregnancy test out of the dog's mouth, get ready, then walk down to wherever that courtyard was.  How was the place all arranged neatly and organized, food ready, candles lit on the table, and all of that perfectly intact in the time for all of the above to happen without interference from anybody else in all of New York?  Exactly how long am I supposed to suspend my belief with a movie?    Transportation - Zoe and Stan spent the whole movie walking, taking taxis (how they met) or subways around town, so the thought was that neither of them had vehicles of their own.  Okay, I'm with you; it's New York, so I get that.  But when Zoe accepted the invitation to Stan's farm, she rode out in this nice Ford Explorer.  But you never saw that vehicle again throughout the rest of the movie!!    I was on board with the premise of this movie; however it was excuted horribly.  I'm not going to harp on inconsistencies (do the main characters ever WORK?  Isn't J-Lo Hispanic, yet Linda Lavin (from the 70s t.v. show \\"Alice\\") and a pitifully frail looking Howard Cunningham from \\"Happy Days\\" are her grandparents, and her Mom character in the movie is also white?  Why doesn't Stan think about selling that farm in rural upstate New York when he says he won't be able to contribute with taking care of Zoe's babies?).      If there was one bright spot about this movie, it was the Dad character Stan met, and apparently made friends with, in the scenes at the park.  He was very funny in telling Stan what he was in for when it came to being a parent and his outlook on kids.  And instead of commiserating over beers, he whips out two juice boxes.  Cute.    I will admit that I have seen decent \\"chick flick movies\\" (\\"My Best Friend's Wedding\\" comes to mind).  But this one is why \\"chick flick\\" movies have such a bad reputation.  Avoid this at all costs...unless you don't mind watching someone faint inside of an inflatable baby pool filled with water where someone had just taken a dump AND given birth.  Not funny; just gross.
B003ODL004|4.0|After listening to the music from the soundtrack, I see how Zimmer used his one main theme, found on the last track of the album, throughout the entire movie. It is a very enjoyable album. I would recommend this soundtrack.
B002ZG9968|1.0|There was no believable chemistry between the main characters.  The main funny part of the movie was when the little dog fell over with the cart.  As a matter of fact the dog was the funniest character in the movie.  J-Lo's one dimensional acting did not work in this movie at all.
0385732554|4.0|First, I want to thank Gretchen Rubin, whose The Happiness Project led me to The Giver. It was on a list of children's books she loved. I think it should be on any thoughtful adult's list as well. Jonas is chosen to hold all the memories in a world where everything is ordered and organized in such a way that no one needs to make decisions. Hunger, want, violence, chaos do not exist in this well-ordered society and its members are spared as well the pain of imperfect children and frail elders. No one questions anything - except Jonas. And as he is given all the memories that exist, he increasingly questions how society is organized and whether or not people would be better remembering for themselves.<br />This is a though-provoking book for anyone who has wrestled with the thorny issues around societal control and information flow. Who owns our memories? How much information should be shared? It may be that this is essential reading for anyone who is trying to figure out social media and anyone who has ever reflected on the appropriate boundaries for government. It certainly broadened my perspective.

B0040JHNZ2|4.0|I have just finished this book. It ws a good read, the characters were believable and the historical research involved made for an interesting story.  I thought as I was reading it that it was quite commercial.  I know that Follett's focus is often historical but I think he is still trying to recapture his Pillars of the Earth without much success. This is a worthwhile story to wad over a long holiday break.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side is everything you've heard about, and more.    Yes, it deserves all the awards it has won, it's probably Sandra Bullock's best ever performance (though Speed is a personal favorite of mine) and there's a very good reason the Blind Side has been the talk of the town over the last year.      It's a perfect family film for its ability to keep your attention, and an emotional adventure for a teenager struggling to keep up his grades until eventually becoming a star football player (played by Quinton Aaron).    The focus is less about football and more about Quinton Aaron's character gradually improving his grades and winning the hearts of, not only his new family that adopted him after seeing what kind of terrible lifestyle he was living, but the hearts of the entire town as well.      This movie delivers in every single area.  It's enjoyable the entire way through.  Watch it and experience a film totally deserving of its many awards.

B003XMUFGQ|2.0|Clapton continues his slide into irrelevance with this latest disappointment. For the Clapton fanatics he can do no wrong, of course. Heck, he could probably pass gas for 45 minutes and they'd still say he sounds wonderful. But this is merely the latest example of his transition into the \\"easy listening\\" category. For us non-fanatics, he continues to offer effective cures for insomnia like this pillow-friendly collection. At least it's cheaper than a visit to the doctor and a prescription for Xanax.    I'm from the same era as this guy, have listened to and enjoyed a lot of his music since his Yardbirds and Cream days, but haven't heard anything engaging or inspiring since From the Cradle. I still hope against hope with every new studio release that he'll match some of his early studio or live releases, such as his teamup with Stevie Winwood at Madison Square Garden a year or two ago. After listening to and enjoying that gem just a few weeks ago, and then hearing this newest one, the contrast is astounding. Clapton here sounds tired, lethargic, and like he's on auto pilot. Just think \\"el snooze-o\\" and \\"65 going on 85.\\"    This album should be required listening at the dinner hour at every nursing home in America. It'll help the residents' digestion issues and assure them of some nice beddy bye time. I may be a grandpa myself but I'm still rockin' and rollin'. I just wish Eric was, too. Save your hard-earned cash, folks.
B0002IQOZA|4.0|October 2nd, 2010<br /><br />I'm gonna rate all the songs here, but the ones I like will have a comment too.<br /><br />1. Christmas Time - I love this upbeat X-Mas jam. It's very fun. I also like the lyrics. 4 stars.<br /><br />2. This Year - 3.5 stars.<br /><br />3. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas - She does need to calm down a little bit. But this is one of the better songs here. 4 stars.<br /><br />4. Angels We Have Heard On High - This has a laid-back feel to it, with a little bit of bass and such but it's wonderful. As long as you don't mind Christina giving it her all on certain points. She has a few high notes here too. Best song so far. 4.25 stars.<br /><br />5. Merry Christmas, Baby - A soulful and bluesy Christmas ditty that almost doesn't fit with the rest of these songs. 4.25 songs.<br /><br />6. O Holy Night - For once, Christina actually sticks to the script on this one...that is until she gets to the end and lets loose again. Not a bad rendition, but it was great while she had a little restraint at first. Well...while it lasted! 3.75 stars.<br /><br />7. These Are The Special Times - 3.5 stars.<br /><br />8. This Christmas - I wish she didn't shout so much. I see what some other reviewers meant. This song is a Christmas classic but she used the tip top of her voice's power in this song which wasn't needed. 3.75 stars.<br /><br />9. The Christmas Song - My absolute new favorite X-mas song from her. I thought the dance version was good but that was until I heard THIS. The almost a cappella feel to this song is amazing! 4.5 stars.<br /><br />10. Xtina's Xmas (Interlude) - Unnecessary. Not included in the final score since it's so short and pointless. 3 stars.<br /><br />11. The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix) - I've heard this many, many times and love it. 4.25 stars.<br /><br />Besides [[ASIN:B003FMTZOM BIONIC (Explicit)]], this is the last CD I have to experience by Christina as far as I'm concerned (I'm not interested in [[ASIN:B0031SBOKI Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits]] really so I don't count that \\"album\\"). I heard the tracks on youtube, and although I do think Christina *totally* over-did it on some songs, this is still an enjoyable set and I'd be a lying fool if I told you I didn't try to sing some of the songs with her!<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is quite a good CD. HOWEVER, it can be incredibly difficult to try to sing with Christina because not only does she have an incredible vocal range, but her melismatic way of singing and adding note after note to 1 or 2 syllable words makes it hard to imitate or sing along to.<br /><br />Bye!<br /><br />3.975 ~ 4 stars or an 8/10.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />'The Christmas Song'<br />'Angels We Have Heard On High' &<br />'Merry Christmas, Baby', and although I do think Christina *totally* over-did it on some songs, this is still an enjoyable set and I'd be a lying fool if I told you I didn't try to sing some of the songs with her!

B002ZG977Y|3.0|Zeus in an overly tight silver suit of armor.  Liam Neeson looking bored.<br /><br />Hades and his flashy comings and goings (the same smoke-trailing effect we saw with Dr. Johann Krauss in [[ASIN:B001F7MSFW Hellboy II]], except now in black) somehow striking me as anti-smoking public service announcements.<br /><br />Io, Perseus' protector, advisor and possible otherworldly hook-up, and her ridiculously perfect makeup and hair.<br /><br />Physical settings that change from highland forest to full-on desert in the space of 500 yards.<br /><br />A 1000-foot-tall kraken--it had to outdo the most recent incarnation from [[ASIN:B000U7UWVA Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]--that looks like a cranky snapping turtle, with big, city-slappin' tentacles.  And it opens its mouth really wide and roars, like every other predictable movie monster you've seen in the past ten years.<br /><br />A truly cheesy-looking Medusa.  Not quite as claymation-jerky as the original [[ASIN:B000Q7ZOL2 Clash of the Titans]] but surprisingly close.  You'd think with all of the CGI horsepower throbbing through this film, they would have taken great pains to get this crucial character right.  Nope.<br /><br />If Zeus has to give you a god-coin to get Charon to take you across the River Styx to get to the Medusa's lair, and then afterwards you get to hop on the Pegasus to just pop on back to Argos in a couple of hours after if took you ten whole days to get to the Medusa in the first place, then why didn't you just take the freekin' Pegasus in the first place, and just have it wait for you?  Jeebus!<br /><br />Yeah, I get that we've got gods, demigods, demons and other non-human types futzing about all through the film, the whole line-between-Heaven-and-Earth thing going on, but the impossible human-oriented physics, like a 500-foot drop into water, and surviving, and then looking absolutely ravishing as you wash up on a beach that wasn't even in the falling-into-the-water scene just doesn't achieve that crucial movie requirement of getting me to suspend my disbelief.<br /><br />Just junk.<br /><br />As always, absolutely great to see Pete Postelthwaite in a role, any role, even if we don't get nearly enough of him.<br /><br />Bottom line: strangely enough, one of the previews of this DVD is for the original Clash of the Titans, and having seen it recently on cable, I feel more like watching it again (even with Harry Hamlin's helmet-like hair) than this ridiculous premise to trot out all of the neato CGI tools we have.suspend my disbelief.

B002ZG9968|3.0|I see a lot of people did not like this movie but for me it was not bad I like Jennifer Lopez at times but in this movie  i think her acting was a little out there if you look at her other earlier work and compare it to this her acting facial expressions seems fake.. I even wonder if it was another leading lady if it would have worked out better. But any way i actually like the movie and the concept and understand the view of a single woman who feels her clock ticking and still single. it has its funny moments and prefer the acting of the leading actor don't remember his name.<br /><br />I am a die hard romantic and can appreciate an ok film but the roles that Jennifer is picking of lately needs to be better but i like this one wayyyyyyyyyy better than the roles she has been in lately.

B003NHRIVQ|2.0|In one word, depressing. Okay okay. I liked the storyline overall, but it was just not my kind of movie. It was just way to sad and when I watch a movie I want to come away feeling good. Not like I want to go curl up in a blanket and cry. Although my friend I saw it with loved it. It's just my taste.
B000002KHH|5.0|I waited way too long for this one. most songs are format rack radio playlisted but still great.  The cd was shipped as expected. Great seller.
B001BJ690Y|4.0|This movie has the feel of a comic book brought to life (in fact, the first half of the movie actually has a segment consisting of comic book animation).  This stylistic choice enables Tarantino to present a lot of potentially very disturbing material, especially abundant violence in Volume 1, while making this material reasonably palatable (and I generally don't like watching violence).  It also gives the movie a sort of surreal and twisted feel which makes the movie suprisingly engrossing.  On the other hand, the plot and characters are relatively cartoonish (though the acting is solid), and I didn't really discern much deeper meaning in the movie, despite a total running time of about 4.5 hours.  In short, this movie is entertaining in a way that might even tempt you to watch it more than once, but don't look for anything more than entertainment.

0525951652|1.0|I've listened to the audible audio version of this book. It's quite good, as an enjoyable read (or listen) as any other books by Mr Follett. Can't rate it more than one star though because of the terrible ebook pricing - what are they thinking? Kindle readers shouldn't have to pay hardback prices for an electronic copy of the book, it's just not the same thing.
B002RT85RW|5.0|This is one of the best deal possible in today's market, it's a highly recommend set for anyone recording lot of movies. Durability & Reliability at the highest level.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|One of the best films I have seen in ages, one that only improves on further viewings, and it is a poor reflection of mainstream reviewers that they did not embrace the innovative approach to telling Robin's story before all the aspects associated with the legend began.  Indeed, this is the first time I have written an Amazon review because I liked this film so much: it combines a great action story with unerring recreation of 12th century England and France, the extraodinary acting skills of Max von Sydow and Cate Blanchett as well as an excellent Russel Crowe, a touching romance between Robin and Marion, enough fighting to appease any Iron Man fan, and how many action films that our kids see give them an understanding of the Magna Carta and the basics of modern economics?

1878424319|5.0|This book is amazing. In just very simple words and sentences it teaches you very deep serious Toltec teachings which you can apply to your daily life to live a free and happy life.    I've read many other books around spirituality (i.e. books from famous author Carlos Castaneda), but this one is different because the author(don Miguel) has tried to share Toltec wisdom in context of daily life not in concept of Toltec masters and their students. This makes it easy to understand and accept for everyone from any background and culture with any religion.    I liked it so much that I decided to buy one every time I want to give a gift to a friend as it would be the best gift in my opinion.    Carlos Castaneda did a great job writing books about Toltec wisdom and the teachings of his master (Don Juan) and I really liked those books and found them very true and useful. This time don Miguel did a great job writing his books in a way that you can easily relate Toltec teachings to realities of day to day life without being focused on Toltec wisdom and its teachings. This way don Miguel will have more readers because the focus of his message is on lifting the spirituality of the reader.    The other thing I felt about this book was the LOVE energy which the author is radiating in his words and sentences. Don Miguel is a true LOVE messenger.    I really thank him for sharing his true knowledge of wisdom and freedom with us.
0718154770|4.0|I am crazy for Chef Jamie Oliver, followed his Reality Show in Marshall, VA and enjoy his cookbooks.  Love this Guy!  That being said, in the description, it doesn't mention if the measurements are US Standard or Metric.  Afterall, if you are trying to reduce your time in the kitchen and have to deal with conversions, it just creates extra steps.  And most of us wont see metric when shopping for the ingredients.  Anyway, just be sure to ask.
B0018QCXH8|3.0|It's ok, if you don't have anything else to watch. I bought it thinking it would be a classic. Wrong! Very long, like a classic should be...but not a classic. Great acting, great everything really. However, just boring! I kept waiting for it to go somewhere. Like I said, if you don't have anything else to watch, then yes...it's a decent movie. I wouldn't buy it though. I would just watch it on HBO.
B002JVWRAO|4.0|I'm giving this 4 stars because I love Supernatural and I am happy to have the 5th Season on DVD. However, I buy the boxsets because I expect some good special features, which were lacking. Like the Official Companion Guide to Season 4, the Season 5 DVD boxset is disappointing. Seasons 4 and 5 explored a whole new realm and it certainly caused much interesting discussion the world over. So it is disappointing that this has not been further explored in the companion guide or the DVD special features. The season 4 boxset was excellent. The season 5 boxset has 1 deleted scene, 1 commentary, the ghostfacers webisodes (I'm not convinced that everyone likes to see more of the ghostfacers), a fairly annoying gag reel, and featurettes that you must access using an even more annoying interactive tour of Bobby's home. The featurettes were fairly interesting, the most interesting being interviews with Kripke and information on the brotherly link between Lucifer and Michael. What is lacking in both the books and DVDs is any sort of substantial interview with, or commentary on, Misha Collins and the Castiel character, who I do believe are vital to Seasons 4 and 5 of Supernatural. I really hope Season 6 will be great.

B0021L8V1Q|3.0|I came to a realization last night as I sat in my home office while my partner watched Iron Man 2 in the other room. I had just as much enjoyment of the movie only LISTENING to it, as he did while WATCHING it.<br /><br />To be honest I did watch some of it. When I needed to refill my wine I walked through the living room and looked at the current scene that was playing. So I probably saw about 20 minutes of the movie - I like my wine.<br /><br />The effects were very high quality as one would expect - the lighting sabres of the Mickey Rourke character flashed on the screen and gave me a \\"charge\\". The briefcase suit was a clever gimmick - but it worked and I felt like I was watching a scene from the new Transformers movie (let's hope they get it right next time).<br /><br />RDJr. is excellent as always. Plot, meh. It's been redone so many times - there was really nothing fresh about the PLOT itself. Bad guy. Revenge. Daddy. Arrogant military. Congressional oversight. Odd cameo from Gary Shandling. Seriously?<br /><br />The other problem is that half the movie was boring, and half the movie was \\"OH MY GOD!!!\\" It was a roller coaster, but not in a good way. Pacing fell flat in the middle of the movie - then someone realized it and threw some action in to get the viewer's attention back.<br /><br />It was, however, entertaining to see \\"Guy Flegman\\" as the bad-guy enabler. I miss him from Galaxy Quest. But - since that was the last big thing I remember him from, I didn't take his character seriously at ALL. The whole time I was hearing in my mind - \\"expendable crew member\\" - can you blame me?
B0011X9SDA|5.0|arrived sooner then expected.  the packaging was great.  And the product was exactly what I hoped for.  A picture perfect vidio!
B000002KKC|4.0|I have to say that this album is intreaguing. I think Buckingham really dominates the proceedings here, writing 9 of the songs, as compared to the 6 bu McVie and 5 by Nicks.   I will start off by saying (and hence guaranteeing my unhelpful reviews), that I do not like Nicks. Can't stand the voice and the witchy persona. I find her songs meandering and tuneless. Can't see the hype in her. So her songs are always a write off for me. (Her songs on Tango in the Night are EVEN worse.) McVie is competetent here. I really like 'Never make me cry' a beautiful ballad and her other stuff is ok.  Buckingham really experiments and I like all of his tracks here. There are hints of the Beach Boys (hints? heck it IS the beach boys!) on 'that's all for everyone'...(listen to the 'must be just exactly what I need. Beatles sounds in the backwards guitar swirlings in 'Not that funny'. His songs range from the upbeat and very stocatto offerings 'The ledge' instantly catchy, 'that's enough for me' and 'Not that funny'. Really like these tracks. The aforementioned 'That's all for everyone' is more slow and 'save me a place' and 'walk a thin line' are very memorable ballads. I also really like 'Tusk'.  I would love to see what an album would have sounded like with these nine Buckingham tracks and maybe another three of his own compositions.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|I purchased this book on my Kindle, based on all the hype about the book and the movie was just coming out. Problem was, I read the whole book with the voice of Julia Roberts in my head. So that was kinda weird. Then, I quickly realized that this author was relating a story that average 'folks' really can't relate to and it was tiresome to hear how fantastic and amazing she is. Apparently there is no financial boundary for this author, so coupled with the mental picture of Julia Roberts, I got pretty sick of it at the end. It's still kind of interesting, but be prepared to deal with the \\"me\\" overload.
B000FBJAF0|4.0|I read first line and knew i had read it before when it first came out 7 years ago. Didn't matter. As compelling and exciting as first time. I wish Forsyth wrote more books.
0792846443|5.0|It is really hard to get me to cry. I broke my back and I didn't cry. I have had family members die and I didn't cry. It's just really hard. After watching this movie, it was the first time in a long time I cried. I am obscenely claustrophobic when it comes to being unable to move when freedom is so close (like sitting in a very very very boring classroom).    This movie got to me, and still does get me. Annie Wilkins is this crazy psycho b!tch and the sad thing is that my mother is like that, as well. Just totally far gone to where no matter what you say it's like she can only hear whats in her head most times.    Absolutely ex-ce-llent movie. If I could give it more than a 5/5 I would. Definitely a must see movie...honestly. Pick it up right now. You won't be sorry!...Until you go to bed >:)    John McAdam  Author of:  Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?  Am I Mad Or Coherent?
0596009208|5.0|When you first glance through this book you will notice all of the retro pictures and half jokes.  I've never read a Dummys/Idiots book on programming, but I can imagine them having the same look and feel.  But then when you dig into the actual content...<br /><br />This book, to me, felt like a good class on Java programming from a great professor who has real world experience - the tone is conversational and the topics selected that make the most real world sense.  There are a few large \\"class projects\\" that have a very real world feel to them (a networked beatbox anyone?).  Important points are pounded home.  It is the class but without the text book...<br /><br />The topics covered also seemed to have a \\"real person\\" feel as opposed to a textbook feel.  I read another popular Java book just before this one.  It threw 2 chapters on GUI basics as almost an afterthought, there was no networking, nothing about inner classes, nothing about making distribution packages, etc.  In that book the basic ideas were gone over in great depth, greater than here, but these more practical topics were skipped or had the briefest mentioned.<br /><br />With this book you start using Swing just a little more than half way through the book.  All the topics in the last paragraph (plus many others) were covered in a practical method.<br /><br />This book, however, isn't perfect.  As mentioned above, this book is like a good class on Java programming without the textbook.  Sometimes the textbook is needed.  When I was in school I always read the textbook no matter how good the prof - it was needed to get the full benefit of the info.  I also like having good reference books that I can leaf through when I have an issue.  This book is a mediocre, at best, reference book and admits it.<br /><br />It also often gets too cute.  OK, sometimes that is needed, but it can get a little...  As another reviewer mentioned, this books often seems to be aimed at collage age kids, not professional programmers. Not necessarily a bad thing  - I've been out of my 20s longer than I care to admit and I never felt I was too old to be reading it.<br /><br />I would recommend this book if you are just starting off in Java or are rusty and want to pick it back up.  I would also recommend getting a more conventional book as  foil and as a reference.I've been out of my 20s longer than I care to admit and I never felt I was too old to be reading it.

B0025VLELQ|2.0|This movie is good fun. While it is not the best Sci Fi movie around it does deserve a higher rating than what I am about to give.    My problem with this movie is the transfer, picture quality is quite poor compared to what most movies on bluray look like.     If you have used photoshop or a similar program imagine using the noise and despeckle feature. Move the slider to MAX and you'll get what we have here, faces that lose all detail and look like plastic masks. Unfortunately the lack of definition is visible trough the whole movie and there are only a few bits that are more aceptable for a bluray disc.     Since I have never bought the DVD this is is a big improvement over my VHS tape. I am very happy to see this movie again with better quality but if the studio would have made some effort this disc could have been light years better than what it is.
0385504225|5.0|I often don't understand why people have to leave reviews that sound like they are trying to be a professional writer in their review. Simply put, I loved it. I love the sheer intelligence of the man. I challenge the average writer to come up with all the intrigue he manages to get in a book while, at the same time, he is stating pure fact. Our job is figure out what is fact and what is fiction. That is good writing. He is very good at what he does and I hope he keeps doing it. For those of you who do not like books like his, don't read them. Review simple books written by simple writers. There are plenty of them. Leave the masters of writing alone.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|At first listen Flamingo was okay, I was not blown away, nor was I totally hooked as I was with the Killers \\"Day and Age\\". Then a couple weeks later on a long drive I let it play through again. And again. This album is so much more than merely Crossfire. No, it will not surpass \\"Day and Age\\" as my favorite album but Flamingo is a solid effort and a fantastic album in its own right. As a solo album Brandon Flowers hits it out of the park, yet the Killers remain #1 in my standings.
B003Y7L5W8|5.0|what can I say...I had been waiting for a new OMD release for years and the bar had been set high.  Lets just say that the boys did not dissapoint.  Without a doubt this is my favorite release of 2010.  Its everything I've come to love about OMD.  One of their strongest albums to date.  They took their time and released a very diverse and lengthly album full of memorable catchy electronic-pop songs.  Its a return to OMD's signature electronic sounds, catchy hooks, great song writing and Andy's mesmerizing voice.  Its great to see the full lineup back togather again, creating magic.

B0033AX26I|5.0|I've been a fan of the Chieftains for thirty-some years now, and it never ceases to amaze me how they never cease to amaze me.  If you like traditional Mexican music, this is your album.  If you like creepy United States history, especially at this time in our nation's history, this is your album.  If you like the Chieftains, yeah, this is your album.  Bonus:  fabulous album art.  When I opened this package, since I had not seen a picture of the CD before I received it, it gave me chills, it was so awesome.    There are not many times in life when you will find the nexus between Liam Neeson and Chevela Vargas.  Try this!
B002N6QE7M|5.0|The first of the 3 CD set is fairly deep in talking about Biology & genetics, for a person who may not be well versed in college science courses, the following 2 CDs explain more in layman's terms how things we've preceived as FACT over the past several decades,have indeed changed.  This is an extremely fascinating topic that is very well written, or in this case well spoken. I highly recommend getting it.

B0044IJ1S6|5.0|Finally a Blu-Ray set of Depeche Mode Live with lots of music videos and other extras.  One concern there doesn't seem to be a deluxe Blu-Ray set including the 2 CD's like there is for the deluxe DVD which includes the 2 CD's.  Depeche Mode are one of my favorite bands going back to their first released song Photographic on the Some Bizzare Collection.      I was so happy with all of the remastered 5.1 sets of each of their albums.  The remixing of vocals and instrumentation brought you deeper inside the songs while maintaining the integrity of the original vinyl recording.  Most importantly the original CD release of albums like Music For The Masses and Violator were mastered so badly, it detracted from the genius of the songs.  The 5.1 remasters Got The Balance Right !!!    I hope they will re-release all of their live concerts and videos in Blu-Ray, not just from the improved picture quality but most importantly for the sound.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|The thing that grabs so many people in the twilight series is the agelessness. If you are a teenager the appeal is obvious, but those of us that are no longer teens, it helps us remember and ask again \\"is there such a thing as unconditional love\\"? I once believed so and this allows us to dream again. It also makes me want a \\"do over\\" and has made me reassess my look on life. Each movie gets a little better as far as technical aspect. I bought a new HD 3D t.v. just in case Breaking Dawn is in 3D but it, also, allows me to see, close up, the changes from movie to movie. The make up has improved drastically and the contact lenses have also become more pronounced which in Eclipse was not a good thing for Robert Pattinson because the gold contacts made him look blind in some scenes although he compensated beautifully. Although I really disliked the ending, I was impressed with him in Remember Me. He is an original. I foresee an Oscar in his future if he can deal with all that comes with such huge change his life. Kristen Stewart is a little less \\"twitchy\\" in Eclipse and definitely seems more at ease in her skin.It has been fascinating to watch her transform from gawky teen to the sophisicated Bella in Breaking Dawn. Taylor Lautner does well but I have a hard time watching him because his description in the book has him as a very tall man which he obviously is not but does not keep me from enjoying his performance. I admire his dedication to his role.  I am very disappointed with the release date of Eclipse and Breaking Dawn. The fans have been very good to all involved in the Twilight series and I feel it is not being reciprocated. If the dvd release date were sooner, it would give people, in this economy , time to buy more than one Eclipse Christmas gift which, I believe, is the reason behind the long release date.   I urge everyone to treat themselves to this dvd, in my opinion, is the best in the trilogy so far as the acting, technical and quality of the movie over all. Enjoy the visit to unconditional love
B0007SMD3W|5.0|The first cd, was a little different than my album. That is what I like about imports. The first cd even comes with the words !   The second Cd, is just packed with bonuses ! Fron Demos, single hits + roigh mixes, are excellent ! A must buy for any Genesis fan !
B0015DROBO|4.0|The key to enjoying the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is to keep expectations low. I expected to be wowed and amazed by the novel and on that regard it did not at all meet expectations. It is however a solid novel that is an above average thriller. There are certain flaws, such as the seeming perfection of the protaganist and American readers will have to adjust to all of the European/Swedish names, cities, etc. but that is not a big issue.
B003R4ZMNQ|1.0|Though its been on for a short time so far, I could barely get through the first showing.  I enjoyed Alex O'loughlin in, \\"Moonlight\\", but as Steve McGarret, never. Why do these shows have to star so many young people?  Every character was replaced with young people excluding the Governor's part.  What's wrong with putting some wise older characters in these shows.  So what if the Governor in this show is an older woman in charge, Steve McGarret's character is what made the show. Scott Caan as Danny is annoying.  He needs a shave and his attire is tacky and unprofessional looking as some of the other cast members are. No F.B.I. agent that I've been around would dress and look this way.<br /><br />A little explosive action in a show is fine, but don't over power it with too much special effects. Is this what's going to hold this show together?  Give me a good story line to follow. Yes, I am a true fan of the original Hawaii Five-O series.  Some things should remain classic and unchanged.<br /><br />For the comment about Jack Lord being pleased with this show if he were alive, maybe not.  According to what I've read about him and his demanding perfection of the Hawaii Five-O series, somethings may not have been to his liking.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|This movie was better than I expected. It was like a mix of 'The Mummy' and '300' I never played the game, so I couldn't compare it. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a Prince named Dastan. When the King is murdered, Dastan is framed. He soon finds a mysterious dagger that can turn back time. He is forced to team up with a Princess named Tamina who helps Dastan prove his innocence. If you love action, you'll love PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME!!!
B0034G4OVS|4.0|This movie is hard to classify. It's sold as horror. But it's more of a psychological horror piece than the usual bloody, gutsy fare.<br /><br />It shares a common filmic ancestry with such films as [[ASIN:B00064AE0G Open Water]] and [[ASIN:B0039ZF87I Thirst]]. It's in many ways a Man vs. Nature story.<br /><br />In this case, three friends get trapped on a ski lift and left stranded, with little hope of rescue, since the ski resort won't be open until the next weekend.<br /><br />The movie very much tries to make you put yourself in their situation, consider your own mortality and ask yourself \\"what would you do?\\"<br /><br />They have to decide whether to stay up on the lift 60+ feet up, jump, climb down the razor-sharp cable to the nearest tower, etc. And of course they have to deal with mother nature, wind, hail, frostbite, wolves, etc.<br /><br />It not really about 'scares' so much as a general sense of unease throughout. With respect to the features on the disc, there are several making-of featurettes, including how the idea came about, how and where they scouted for the location(s), casting, etc. There are a few extended or deleted scenes as well.<br /><br />Overall, it's a pretty decent disc. At least worth a cheap rental. Don't know how much replay value there is in it?
B000LC55F2|3.0|The Prestige is an absolutely brilliant movie; the acting is good, the writing is awesome, and the direction is fantabulous.     That said, I hated it.    Going in, I expected a dark movie with a possibly tragic ending; I did not expect a movie where I could not sympathize with a single character for more than two minutes at a time whose plot revolved on an out-of-left-field, mind-bogglingly ridiculous contrivance. The hatred that grows between the two main characters is fascinating to watch, especially with Jackman and Bales' fine acting, but it didn't really draw me in; the only characters I felt honestly bad for were Borden and Angiers' wives.     Furthermore, the 'trick' behind Angiers' act is completely unexpected, unsupported by any previous information you're given in the movie, and is less 'wow' than it is 'what the-?' Sure, it serves as shock value, and makes you realize just how far Angiers is willing to go, but it's the sort of deus ex machina that's unexpected in a Nolan movie.    Basically? Watching this movie didn't make me think 'Gee, I just wasted two hours of my life', and I'm not upset I saw it, but I wouldn't waste money buying it.
0312600844|5.0|I strongly recommend it. I found it to be a very absorbing and complex book, which is why I finished it, unlike some of the other reviews here. My husband also couldn't put it down. The characters are well drawn individuals and not generalizations and yet the book reflects and explores themes we understand from our own marriages, close relationships, and experiences with grown or nearly grown children. Seeing the world through the eyes of a varied group of men who were thoughtfully depicted was a refreshing change from many of the novels I read. The depiction of the cultural fissures in our society was also very well done. But, when all is said and done, the reason I recommend this book so highly is because it is simply a very satisfying and intricate story, where the people are never static and there is always another perspective to grasp.
B0044KI7B6|5.0|The story line is completely different from all the other episodes, I am not sure it will do as well as the others. We can only wait and see. I do believe there are other story line writers, the change is too obvious not to be. But those boys are still my favorite so I will muddle thru all the episodes and hope for the best.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|Up isn't actually my first Pixar disappointment. I didn't really like A Bug's Life or Cars, and in my opinion The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and WALL-E fell short of their potential. Up has really gotten a lot of attention though, absolutely adored by critics and constantly popping up in pop culture. I feel like if DreamWorks or Blue Sky Studios (who don't have such polished reputations) had made this film, it would be called \\"fine but unremarkable\\" or \\"underwhelming\\".<br /><br />Up gets off to a promising start. After their childhood back-story is established, there is a long montage of the married life between Carl Fredricksen and his wife Ellie. It evoked real emotion, as I watched time pass in their world, it reminded of how \\"time flies by\\" in the real world, and a lot of the regret that comes with long-term procrastination, with distant dreams that you want to happen but secretly know won't.<br /><br />Carl somehow lifts his house off the ground using balloons. It's required I guess, the lifting of the house is a huge part of Carl and his character. You need it for him to even get started on his journey. It even adds a layer of adventure, makes it *epic*. But then the movie feels the need to have an antagonist.<br /><br />Charles Muntz is a poorly handled villain in a movie that didn't need one. He's spent years in South America looking for this cryptid bird, and he's become so afraid that someone will steal his glory that he's ready to kill. It's ridiculous think he wouldn't want to join up with other explorers and make his life easier. He may want all the credit, but to turn evil? He's rather vengeful toward to the bird, which seems to be outside the nature of this kind of character. He cares about his dogs, but not a bird that has pretty much dominated his life for years? How could he NOT have caught this thing by now? If he's never owned chocolate, how come Beta and Gamma could recognize its smell? Why doesn't he show the world his other amazing discoveries and become famous again? He could have been portrayed as a willing but broken old man who just wants to do something meaningful. He could even have symbolized what happens to a person when they can't admit to themselves that some dreams can't be realized.<br /><br />Ed Asner was great as Carl, and Jordan Nagai was pretty good as Russell. Was I emotionally involved in their \\"I don't have a son, and I don't have a dad\\" relationship? No, I found it tired and sentimental.<br /><br />Up is rather barren, you don't see much of anything. There's a bird, a zeppelin, dogs, and that's all. At one point Muntz mentions how he's lots so many dogs to the labyrinth. Suddenly I got really interested. \\"Wow, a giant maze out here...that just sounds so cool!\\" The labyrinth is sort of seen, but they don't actually go in or anything. The film's whimsy doesn't remedy this and works against it. One would expect a movie set in a jungle (or rather, a tepui) to be atmospheric, but talking dogs don't exactly allow that. They are unfunny and unwelcome. It gets too fantastical to really fit with the tone previously set up.<br /><br />I was surprised that I didn't like Up very much, and at first I found it hard to admit to myself that I hadn't liked it. It doesn't work as a character study, nor as an adventure film.and become famous again? He could have been portrayed as a willing but broken old man who just wants to do something meaningful.

0786880708|5.0|As a rule, I do not like self-help books.  I feel that they are money making schemes that manage to work for a select few, and these few are then touted as proof that the author's method works.  Kabat makes few such promises, and I have found that his methods deliver more results than anything you can buy anywhere else on the market.  He tells you how meditation and mindfullness works, not where it will get you in life.  Instead of selling large and radical adjustments to your life, he advocates for small changes, most of which are a shift in one's perception of how to approach one's internal life.  He gives methods and ideas that enable one to step aside from one's self and one's daily regiment in life while not becoming detached from the emotions entalied therein (a far cry from other self-help authors).  Resistance to the dynamics within oneself are discouraged; rather, one is encouraged to embrace all that one feels throughout the day and while in meditation.  I have struggled personally for all of my life, since childhood, and I can honestly say that this book has worked for me.  In fact, I have found the author to be so helpful that I need only read at most 20 pages about every one or two weeks.  I started this book at the beginning of 2010. It is now October, and I still have maybe 100 pages to go.  All the while I have managed to stay afloat some terrible moments and to struggle through them to find hope.  This book deserves some credit for helping me get through these times.  That's what I call getting your money's worth.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Brian Wilson's interpretations of Gershwin are imaginative, playful, musically acute and entertaining. The Show Boat pieces struck me as particularly poignant. It's worth a listen for any Beach Boys and/or Gershwin fan or music lovers in general.
B00005ABX0|5.0|I was 3 years old when this album was released,and heard it over and over being played by my much older siblings. When they were all moved out, I found the record and, at age 7 or 8, had a fantastic time rediscovering and remembering these strange, entertaining, beautiful songs all over again. I still have the LP, though it's pretty much 'unlistenable' by now, and am really happy to see it remastered on Amazon. Personal favorites were always 'Vegetables', 'Heroes and Villains' and 'Fall Breaks and Back to Winter' ( besides, obviously, 'Good Vibrations'.) They had an address for a fan club on the jacket- wonder if they ever received my dopey letter. What great memories- thank you, Brian Wilson and Amazon!

0525951652|5.0|The jacket forthrightly tells us that \\"Fall of Giants\\" is Book 1 of the Century Trilogy.  It is of a similar length to \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\", Follett's two previous exercises in blockbuster historical fiction; assuming the length holds in the remaining installments, the saga will be around 3000 pages when it concludes in 2014.  \\"Fall of Giants\\" is not Follett's best work (that would be \\"Pillars\\", in my estimation), but assuming that he can keep up the same level of quality, the Century Trilogy may yet end up as his magnum opus, if for no other reason than sheer scope and length.  Spoilers follow.    The basic conceit is to follow five families through the entire 20th century (well, it starts in 1911, but close enough):  there are the Williams siblings, Ethel and Billy, the children of Welsh coal miners; The Earl Fitzherbert and Lady Maud, Anglo-Welsh aristocratic siblings; Grigori and Lev Peshkov, Russian peasant brothers; Walter von Ulrich, a German aristocrat; and Gus Dewar, the son of a US senator.  And each of these five groups come with parents, friends, and other attendant supporting characters; no wonder the novel has a multi-page index of everybody involved, akin to one of Tolstoy's long works.  The novel opens with the coronation of King George V, contrasted with Billy's first descent into the coal mine, and follows the characters through the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and all the social tumult that accompanied it.  One may detect echoes of some of Follett's earlier novels here; in particular, the interaction between the Fitzherberts and the Williamses will undoubtedly remind readers of \\"The Man from St. Petersburg\\", Follett's only other novel set in this timeframe.    The usual Follett themes are here, from women's rights to the rise of the Labour Party (I know Mrs. Follett is a Labour MP; he sometimes comes close to writing Labour Party propaganda here).  Follett's earlier historical novels' most prominent themeis showing how for most of history rich douchebags have been able to do pretty much whatever they wanted so long as they didn't anger other rich douchebags; here we're getting into the era of full democracy, and things are starting to change (the final scene is pretty pointed on this).  Russia obviously experiences the severest case of this, and Follett commendably attempts to delineate the complexity of the revolution and peoples' reactions to it around the world (how a completely legitimate overthrow of a brutal dictatorship ultimately ended up creating another).  Britain makes a more peaceable, but still difficult, transition to full democracy, breaking down the class barriers that had previously existed (Follett, for all his Labour sympathies, does manage to make his main Conservative a reasonably well-drawn character).    By the novel's end, you can see Follett marshalling all the families into position to play major roles in the next great cataclysm, the Second World War, albeit on occasion with perhaps a little too much irony (actual dialogue, on one character being informed that Adolf Hitler has been arrested in the aftermath of the failed 1924 Munich Beer Hall putsch:  \\"Well, thank God that's over.\\").  I will say that, given Follett's stated ambition of tracking his characters through the big sweep of history, there's not a huge amount of time spent in America in this story (Gus Dewar spends most of his time in Europe; one other character does get there, and is set up to be in the thick of Prohibition by the story's end), particularly in contrast to the vivid and thorough pictures painted of socio-political change in the UK and Russia.    Recommended.
1405304677|5.0|I purchased this book after a fellow Scout leader brought this book to Scout camp. I started looking it over and found the instructions for tying the various knows to be very good if not even excellent.  The whole book is in color and the graphics are excellent.  In addition to the knots there is also a section on different types of rope used for knots as well as different types of tools used by sailors to tie various knots used on boats and skips.  I am a Boy Scout leader and I find this book extremely helpful in our instruction of knot uses and how to tie them. I purchased this book from Amazon and got it sooner than they told me when to expect delivery.  Very good company to do business with.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Let me say first that I did not buy this film - I downloaded it in HD.  I am glad that I did not blind buy this one!!  When I heard that they were making a G.I. Joe live action film I said \\"it's about time!\\"  When I saw the promo pics of Snake Eyes, I thought that it looked promising - until I saw the first trailer.  Once I saw that I said this does not look right.  Rip Cord? He was not a major character!    Once I heard that Marlon Wayans and Dennis Quaid would be in it I was not feeling good.  Wayans is about jokes and Quaid does not look athletic.  I had this on my PC since it was first released and I just got around to watching it.  That bad feeling that I had came true.  First is the Destro's ancestor scene which was not needed.  If they felt the need to go back in time, it should have been for Cobra Commander if anything.  The Destro character clearly wears a mask because he is the 'enemy weapons supplier' and does not want to be identified.    Well, aside from the lack of a coherent story that seems like scenes were filmed and put together to hope that they get a movie, the script is horrible!  I rarely talk badly about most film's scripts (except B movies), but this script is one of the worst ever!  Why have Hawk say \\"knowing is half the battle?\\"  That was from the cartoon, not the G.I. Joe universe. They should not have even thought about the cartoon (although it seems as if the makers just watched one episode and felt that they got the gist of it), they should have just made their own vision of it.      I always wondered what if they made a Transformer film and a G.I. Joe film, what would they look like?  I expected The Transformers to look stupid and I expected G.I. Joe to look serious.  Who would have thought that the film that would be harder to make convincing looked and was better, but the easier one was the one that looked foolish and corny?  The actors act as if they know the script sucks, but they are saying it anyway.  None of the actors look likethey are least was put into some basic training and discipline.  They never stand like soldiers, act like soldiers or conduct themselves like soldiers.  Instead, they all look like actors dressed like soldiers.      Since when did G.I. Joe have foreign soldiers?  Roadblock surly was not British and i do not recall Breaker being Moroccan let alone a main character - especially after Dial-Tone came along.  Also, Duke was a Master Sargent not a lieutenant. Hawk was a Brigadier General not a four star general.  I suppose they changed ranks in order to make it more believable that Duke would be the ground leader even is some Joe members out-ranked him and were officers.  The only time I can recall that this got addressed was in G.I. Joe:The Movie when Falcon said to Duke \\"I'm pulling rank!\\"  Some of us actually paid attention to the ranks, names and positions of the figures...    Let me just say that this movie is horrible and I hope that they do not make a sequel.  If they do, PLEASE get someone else to do EVERYTHING on this film.  hell, REBOOT this one now.  i do not know how they messed this up when it should of had a focus on military instead of the cartoon or anything else that did not go together.  Not good.  Also, who cares about Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow fighting?  The did not start out as brothers and Snake Eyes did not start out as a martial artist, he just have the black commando suit and then they turned it into a ninja thing which helped ruin the toy line.    I guess the makers felt that they should throw everyone in a black suit because black always looks cool and dangerous?  G.I. Joe was an AMERICAN thing (although the toys were released internationally but as native to those countries), but they put all of these foreigners in there.  Maybe some people are correct when they say that those who run the Federal Reserve are softening us up for a one world government with all of these British people on American movies, TV shows (tell me when have you seen this in US history?) and worst of all - our NEWS and politics shows!  As you can see from the cover, they thought that Snake Eyes was the selling point.  He was a cool character (mainly the Darth Vader effect with black), but I doubt that he was everyone's main attraction, although his figure was hard to find in stores.      I felt NOTHING for any of the characters.  Hawk did not look strong or like a solider.  I think that the production team thought of this as toy line instead of it being a military thing. I did not care about ninjas, Cobra or G.I. Joe! It was also stupid for the director to have the characters be called their called names from the start of their lives.  Their names are code names not real names! This ruined my great memories of that toy line!  Stick to the cartoon as that was waaaaaaaaaaay better than this film!  This is one to stay away from and is not even worth a rental.  I now you will be hard headed and buy it anyway, but trust me...

0061245097|3.0|This series started out so promising! But once again the main female character becomes so ANNOYING! Why does it seem that all the conflict in these storylines are always self generated? The lead female has to be so strong and powerful to pull off the action but why does she then have to be whiney, stubborn with no selfesteem and did I say stubborn to the point of STUPID? If you can ignore her through most of the book it actually wasntt too bad! I love the male lead, he stands his own throughout the whole series, why he would put up with her I dont know! Which is why I found it lacking, but I still enjoyed these books up to this point and I think I will end it with this one. I couldnt stand another whole book of HER! You have been warned......

B00004Y6NW|5.0|I bought this CD mainly because I'm a big fan of Mark Knofler's style of guitar playing. I personally think that he is Rock's most tasteful and subtle guitarist. He never overplays but uses his solos to build interest and excitment.  Though he posseses an incredible technique he never overplays for the sake of showing off.  What was a suprize to me is how interesting his lyrics are. He paints pictures with his words. The music, like his guitar solos are excellent example of less is more. An album that seems improve every time I listen to it.  Highly recommended.

0345505387|5.0|I loved it. How could I not love this?  It's Jamie Fraser in full, beautiful living color?  Granted, he looked completely different from one page to another, sometimes he had a pretty boy look to him, sometimes he looked older and more steely, but most of the time he was just ... Jamie. *sigh*       When I first heard of this graphic novel idea, I was not into it.  For one thing, I didn't even know what a graphic novel was!  I thought it was something to do with explicit sex!  It seems laughable now, but I was really that clueless!   Graphic novels are basically comic books, only fancier with better drawings (in this case, the art work by Hoang Nguyen is superb.)  The characters are usually more extreme looking, i.e. sharper eyebrows, angular features, provocatively sexy, bigger boobs.  For instance, Claire's are quite prominent here!  The Exile is a work of art.  It's hardcover for one thing, and the colors within are brilliant and evocative of the beauty of the Scottish Highlands, yet it has the separate story frames and overhead voice bubbles - just like a comic book.  It's an odd sort of fusion, but it works.  But, no matter what anyone says, I think a graphic novel is nothing more than a fancy-shmancey comic book.  Yet, if it gets people to read who normally don't read books, then by all means - whatever works!  I'm all for that, but this book is not suitable for children!  Parents, Google Outlander before buying this for your kids!    Here the story is told from Jamie and Murtagh's points of view. I stress, it helps a lot to be familiar with Outlander before reading The Exile.  I loved seeing what Murtagh saw, we're now privy to a lot of things we weren't aware of before, particularly his distrust of Claire and his desire to protect Jamie.  Because of this, The Exile is more political than romantic, in my opinion.  Yes, yes of course we have the basic relationship between Claire and Jamie.  But now the focus is more on Jamie's return from France and dealing with the clan politics at Leoch.  Claire only complicates everything.  Jamie's walking a tightrope between being an outlaw wanted by the English and honoring the Mackenzies without threatening his uncles as a future Mackenzie clan chieftain.         Do the characters look the way I imagined them to look?  Not exactly, but close to it.  I will always have my own idea and vision in mind of how I picture everyone, but I appreciated this book simply for the fun and novelty of it.  I loved the drawings, the clothes in particular.  Apart from Jamie's face looking so different from drawing to drawing, (I guess since it was all hand drawn, it's hard to make him look exactly the same in every drawing) I loved all the various depictions of him and Claire.      For the most part, all the pictures did the original Outlander book justice.  I can't be critical of it.  I guess my one gripe was how blousy Claire looked most of the time, but I chalk it up to the fact this is a graphic novel and she's more sexed up than usual.        Take it from an Outlander lover - this is worthwhile and a must read.  I really surprised myself, I didn't know how I was going to like it.  I'm so glad I have my own copy, it's just lovely and I will peruse it over and over again.  It really makes me want to read Outlander over (for the upteenth time) so I can absorb all these new revelations that have now come out.

B00026WU3M|5.0|Bob Dylan's 1989 release \\"Oh Mercy\\" was an important release in several ways. It marked his first collaboration with Daniel Lanois, who went on to produce the album that launched Dylan's meteoric comeback, 1997's \\"Time Out of Mind.\\" It was also the album that pulled him out of the personal and artistic rut he had been in following 1983's \\"Infidels.\\"<br /><br />After the abysmal quadrilogy of \\"Empire Burlesque,\\" \\"Knocked Out Loaded,\\" \\"Down in the Groove,\\" and \\"Dylan and the Dead,\\" \\"Oh Mercy\\" felt like a breath of fresh air for longtime Dylan fans. Not since \\"Desire\\" had he come up with a work this consistent. Starting with \\"Street Legal,\\" Dylan's album had started to become a hodge podge of top quality tracks mixed with dire filer. For every \\"Changing of the Guards,\\" there was \\"New Pony.\\" For every \\"Dark Eyes,\\" there was clean cut kid. For every \\"Brownsville Girl,\\" there was the rest of \\"Knocked Out Loaded.\\" \\"Oh Mercy\\" only has one real clunker (\\"Everything is Broken\\" - how this made the cut over \\"Dignity\\" is a mystery to me), while everything else is top shelf Dylan of the highest order, from the venomous opening \\"Political World\\" to the soul piercing closer \\"Shooting Star.\\"<br /><br />Lanois' swampy production meshes well with the mostly dreary compositions, such as the chilling \\"Man in the Long Black Coat\\" and the soul bearing \\"What Good Am I?\\" and \\"Disease of Conceit,\\" both revealing insights into Dylan's crumbling personal life at the time. \\"Ring Them Bells\\" is one of Dylan's finest compositions, a desparate prayer that is far more lyrically rich and emotionally sincere than anything from Dylan's short lived and inconsistent Born Again phase. \\"Where Teardrops Fall\\" and \\"What Was It You Wanted\\" are both solid, above average.<br /><br />\\"Oh Mercy\\" signaled a positive change in Dylan's artistic direction, one that would once again establish his importance and relevance as the most important voice in rock.

As portayed by actress Kandyse McClure, \\"Vicki\\" is the wife from hell.  For the first thirty minutes, we're treated to her screeching, cursing, degrading her long suffering husband, David Anders, a recent Vietnam vet. The wife jeers and insults him in a non-stop barrage that never ends.  When the husband runs over a corn child, the wife turns up the insults and one wonders what the husband sees in her--and why he takes it.<br /><br />When the wife is finally murdered, you want to applaud.And the rest of the movie is just one endless marathon were the husband runs through cornfields. His pursuers are so fat, you can imagine them ordering wash tubs of corn dogs during breaks.  Oh, yeah, we're also supposed to be scared of a little boy whose supposed to be the leader--yet, he comes off as a brat who needs his diapers changed real fast.<br /><br />And then we have a bizarre sex scene where a teenage couple strip naked before all the other oorn children have sex--with the little ones all grinning and jumping up and down and leering at each other. You can imagine the director screaming: \\"Act like you love it! Act like dirty little kids!\\"<br /><br />As for the corn monster, there isn't one.  We see corn stalks shaking and then the hero begins to shriek hysterically and the next thing we're shone, is the hero trussed up like a scarecrow. This is a typical Sci-Fi Film, made on a poverty-row budget with a cast of no-name and no-talent performers. This woul be a fun movie to show at a Worst Movie of All Time Party--where it would join the ranks of other worst movie candidates like \\"Rest Stop,\\" \\"Lake Placid II\\" and \\"100 Million BC\\" starring King of the Z'--Christopher Atkins.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Think really long movie that you don't want to end.  Well written, engaging characters, cool music, interesting American Southwest scenes, meth heads and the hijinks their lives entail.  Cranston is a family man and a drug kingpin in a program to which episodic TV would do well to aspire.
B0034G4P7G|1.0|This film is based on how Facebook was created and all the characters who are involved.<br />I mostly saw this film based on the good reviews that I read. But I found nothing brilliant about this film at all. My biggest problem with the film was the protagonist Mark Zuckerberg. If I had known that the Mark Zuckerberg character was so nasty and revolting. I would not have watched the film. He's mean, rude, condescending and treacherous.<br /><br />The only thing that prevented me from walking out on the film after the first ten minutes (where Zuckerberg posts  crude disparaging remarks about his ex-girlfriend online) was curiosity. I don't mind villains and I don't mind `bad boys' ( I actually liked Timberlake's character). But Zuckerberg has no redeemable qualities at all. He's just a straight up unlikable creep.<br /><br />The film actually made me think that it was an updated and modernized version of Mordecai Richlers' `The Apprentiship of Duddy Kravitz'. Like Kravitz Zuckerberg uses people and is baffled by their hurt.<br /><br />The only saving grace in this film for me was Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin. Whom I found to be sweet and too naïve for his own good. Part of me actually wonders  (considering the wealth Zuckerberg has gained from Facebook)  if the producers are really just sticking it to the man.

0439023483|2.0|I was told for about a year that I just had to read this book.  And it certainly sounded like something that would be up my alley.  I love children's literature and a dystopian future situation is always appealing.  The idea of this book was a classic idea, oppressed society under the thumb of a cruel government.<br /><br />But it seems that Collins leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For a book with such intense promise it had a surprising lack of heart and soul.  This should have held a lot more humanity, but instead I was treated to a rather dry battle of kids trying to kill each other and not much else.<br /><br />How did this happen? For one thing, Collins has yet to master the art of characterization.  These characters were nothing but flat descriptions to whom Collins doesn't even pretend to give personality.  I could tell you absolutely nothing about the nature of anyone.  Even the protagonist Katniss is sadly two-dimensional.  She cares for her sister and she can fight. That was all I took from her.<br /><br />Then on top of this a romance is forced with zero chemistry. Granted, situations were provided where reasonable romance can come in, but emotion to back it up? Nothing.<br /><br />The storytelling is weak.  Collins relies far too much on summarizing events to keep the story moving, a bad choice that does \\"get on with things\\" but misses an opportunity to build world, drama, and characters.  Much of the plot is indeed devoted to the games--which means battle, of course--but that's it.<br /><br />The writing itself is not bad. It's simple and straight forward, a style I've always liked, but the rest of the necessary components of story and character are missing, so the writing becomes just a dry account of an emotionless story.  The violence is fun, and there were a select few moments that captivated my interest, but that was it.<br /><br />The sad thing is that \\"The Hunger Games\\" is not a bad idea at all.  But the delivery was poorly executed.
0393072231|5.0|This is the only book I have read that gives an accurate, very readable account of what lead up to and then what occurred during the financial meltdown of 2007-2009.  Lewis is able to take a mundane story that has been told already by a hundred different authors and make it come alive.  You will breeze through this book and have a good understanding of what happened when you put it down a couple of days later.  I would also like to thank Lewis for giving credit where credit is due in that he identifies people like Mike Burry, the real genius and soothsayer in this fiasco, Steve Eisman, Greg Lippmann and Charlie Ledley and Jamie Mai who were early adopters.

0439023483|5.0|This is the book that got me interested in Dystopian fiction.<br />Suzanne Collin's has such a gift with words. Her writing is so vibrant and rich that at times I forgot that I wasn't actually safe in my home.<br />At the beginning of each chapter I would tell myself, \\"Self, you can only read ONE MORE Chapter and then you have to (fill in the blank...Cook, clean, eat, bathe, take care of family, ect...)\\" Needless to say, I didn't listen to myself :o} I kept reading and reading until I was done and after that I replayed the story over and over in my head.<br />This is a story that will stay with me for the rest of my days.

0811870413|5.0|I've enjoyed the visit to Tartine for many years (although it's a chore to get into nowadays because of the lines!) I was excited when this book came out because, trust me, Tartine has the best bread. If you're in the area, you become familiar with their \\"call before 3PM, pick up your reserved loaf after 5PM\\" method. This is the most delicious art I've had. The bread photographed in the book is not special bread dressed up for its Sunday outing, it's the real deal. You could pick up any random loaf there and send it down the catwalk. Now that I have the book, I'm not expecting to equal the bread from Tartine itself, but I will be proud to emulate it as best I can with what I have to work with here. If you're interested in bread itself, this is a good read even if you don't want to actually make the bread or are too intimidated like another reviewer here. It's clear, though, that bread is half art, half science experiment, and half food item. Yes, that's three halves.    Oh, and just in case you're wondering, here's the list of basic tools you'll need:    digital scale for metric measures  small scoop for flour  a thermometer  wide bowl for mixing  rubber spatula  a dough spatula  bench knife  small, clear bowl  kitchen towels (I'm going to need a lot of these)  dutch oven combo cooker  beer or wine or a good single malt scotch (this isn't required for the recipes at all, but it can't hurt)

B000002LRX|5.0|Angel Dust, from Faith No More, is unquestionably in the top 5 best rock albums ever created. Ironically, it was also written and recorded when the band was at its most unstable. Guitarist Jim Martin was on the verge of quitting, and producer Matt Wallace has commented most of the instruments were tracked in the studio at different times as opposed to the entire band recording together. Regardless, from start to finish, each song is a meticulously crafted masterpiece, no two sounding similar unlike the band's previous effort, \\"The Real Thing.\\" I got this album a year or two after it came out, when I was in Jr. High School. I remember thinking on first listen that \\"Land  of Sunshine\\" was possibly the best rock song I'd ever heard. The rest of the album, save for \\"Midlife Crisis\\" took a few listens to grow on me but it wasn't long before \\"Angel Dust\\" shot to the top of my \\"best rock albums\\" list. Early favorites were the two aforementioned tracks in addition to the strange yet driving \\"Crack Hitler,\\" \\"A Small Victory,\\" the appropriately energetic \\"Caffeine,\\" and the beautiful disaster \\"Malpractice.\\" 15 years later, it hasn't slipped from the #1 spot despite my musical horizons expanding tenfold.    Faith No More's biggest strength in my eyes is their ability to reinvent themselves on every single album. That said, they never released such a perfect collection of songs as they did with \\"Angel Dust.\\" AD is a dark album, with many of the lyrics addressing vocalist Mike Patton's strained relationship with his father, as well songs written during periods of drug experimentation. In that regard, I suppose the album was aptly titled. Faith No More's other \\"dark\\" album was their 1985 debut \\"We Care a Lot,\\" and musically foreshadowed some of the themes that would be fully realized on \\"Angel Dust.\\"    One of the highlights of \\"Angel Dust\\" is the perfect vocal performance by Patton. He uses his voice like an instrument, and has a unique talent unmatched by any other vocalist inthe realm of rock. While the album failed to match the sales of its predecessor \\"The Real Thing,\\" it did net the band their only #1 hit, \\"Midlife Crisis.\\"     Oddly enough, \\"Angel Dust\\" was huge all over the world.... except in the USA. I like to think this is because the musical direction of the album was too cerebral for the single-oriented American masses. Because of this, the band gained huge followings in Europe and South America that continue to this day. The American version of \\"Angel Dust\\" only features 13 tracks whereas import versions contain a full 15 song tracklist. The two tracks omitted on the US version are, in my opinion, a must-- a cover of the Commodore's \\"Easy\\" (possibly the band's most well-known song after \\"Epic\\"), and a re-recorded version of \\"As the Worm Turns\\" from \\"We Care a Lot.\\" The new version contains a much superior vocal performance in line with the rest of the \\"Angel Dust\\" album, but lacks the piano intro on the older version. \\"Angel Dust\\" is an album you have to listen to from start to finish, and these two tracks are an essential part of the experience.    \\"Angel Dust\\" isn't just a musical masterpiece; it was a ground breaking record in the world of rock. The album effectively paved the way for the entire \\"NuMetal\\" genre which would become extremely popular in the late '90s and early 2000s, although none of these bands could match the talent and originality of Faith No More. \\"Angel Dust\\" rocks hard from start to finish, climaxing (appropriately) in the guitar-laden \\"Jizzlobber.\\" Occasionally veering off the path for piano numbers like \\"RV,\\" or easy listening ballads like \\"Easy,\\" the album keeps you wondering what sort of musical genius will surface on the next track. The album is also keyboard and synth heavy, definitely the best performance from resident FNM keyboardist Roddy Bottum. I can't think of any other band where the keyboard plays as big a role in the music as Faith No More. Drug problems and inter-band relations meant there wasn't much input from Roddy on \\"Angel Dust's\\" followup, \\"King for A Day, Fool For a Lifetime\\" and the resulting absence of keyboards is glaringly obvious.    Newcomers to Faith No More ought to start with \\"Angel Dust,\\" as it is more indicative of the direction the band took during their glory years. While \\"The Real Thing\\" was a bigger commercial success, it sounds extremely dated and...... well, commercial. Overproduced and slick, \\"The Real Thing\\" doesn't sound like anything else in their catalog. In that vein, people who wrote the band off as a cheesy 80s act after hearing TRT need to give Faith No More another chance and pick up \\"Angel Dust.\\" Don't just take my word for it..... Take the word of the five star AVERAGE this album has here on Amazon. Just be sure to find an import version that contains all 15 tracks.
0547258305|1.0|This is one of those books that just made me want to strangle the author at several points in the book. The book is full of poor characterizations. It has an almost total lack of theme development. The ending drags on far too long. And it is full of flat-out bad philosophy.    This is really sad, because there is so much about \\"Graceling\\" that is good. I was willing to overlook its flaws for a time. But then Cashore started to bash me on the head with her agenda and I lost all patience with her. If Cashore wants to witness where her bad philosophy will take her heroine -- Katsa is her name -- I would suggest she watch the musical \\"Elisabeth.\\" Elisabeth's fate will be Katsa's, just give her about 20 years. Katsa's inability to give herself in relationships with people will turn her into an empty, lonely shell of a woman. And I'm not talking about marriage here. All meaningful relationships require us to give a part of ourselves to another individual. Katsa takes Elisabeth's anthem \\"Ich gehör nur mir (I belong to me)\\" far too literally. Remember that \\"Ich gehör nur mir\\" taken too far turns into \\"Rudolf, wo bist du? (Rudolf, where are you?).\\" And that is not somewhere anyone wants to be. ([[ASIN:B000QZUALI Elisabeth - Gesamtaufnahme live aus dem Theater an der Wien (Oktober 2005)]] -- Note: \\"Rudolf, wo bist du?\\" is called \\"Kapuzinergruft\\" on this recording)    Or as C.S. Lewis put it, \\"Nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours. ... Look for yourself [meaning: seek your *self*], and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay.\\"    Katsa -- and Cashore -- would be wise to heed the warning!    p.s. Just because the book ends with Katsa surrounded by people, it does not mean she has meaningful relationships. Meaningful relationships require giving up a part of yourself to another person. Eventually Katsa's failure to do so will drive people away from her. Many of the loneliest people in the world are those ina crowd.
B000002UC5|5.0|I haven't listened to this in years. Looks like it's out-of-print now, and new prices here on Amazon are shown as being anywhere from $29.99 to more than $130. Is it worth this kind of money? The simple answer is NO. In fact, if you don't own the original but want to hear it, check your local library to see if they have a copy that you can check out. (That's where I got the CD version I just listened to. I have the LP version at home.)    Listening to it again made me realize how \\"simple\\" the songs were. Yet, they brought back many fond memories of when it was first released. Definitely worth hearing again.

B0034G4P7G|5.0|Before I review the film, I would like to mention that I do have Facebook account, and its sole purpose is to allow friends who I have lost touch with - and who live all over the United States, and the world - to find me if they want to. I also have a extremely rare ethnic last name and no one in the entire world of 6 billion+ people has the same first and last name, which makes my name unique, so I carefully guard my privacy. I have the barest of personal info on Facebook and the highest of security settings. I also spend close to zero percent of my time socializing or keeping track of people I know through Facebook or other social networking sites. Why? As the Social Network makes perfectly clear: Nothing, but nothing, takes the place of real, live people in face-to-face relationships!<br /><br />After watching Social Contract it left me feeling both amazed at Mr. Zuckerberg's good instincts and his fortitude in not letting anyone hold him back and allowing himself to succeed beyond his wildest dreams - and empty -  by his profound loneliness and from the persistent discord that swirled around him throughout almost the entire movie. I also found  irony in the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg did not cooperate in any way with the making of Social Network because it exposed his private life to the world - but, yet, the general public is encouraged to give him (Facebook) as much of our personal information as we can!<br /><br />Social Network is interesting because you see what a person with good instincts can achieve in the real world. While I don't approve of people mistreating each other, the history of inventing anything important is full of stories like Social Network. For example, lawsuits over patents are a big business, that's why we have an army of \\"patent\\" attorneys here in the United States! (I also found it so delicious that the founder of Napster, who brought the recording industry down on its knees, played a key role in providing critical good advice to Mr. Zuckerberg's success. I know how malignant the recording industry can be. None other than the legendary Nigerian drummer Baba Olatunji told me a how one the biggest record companies in the world viciously screwed him out of a lot of money!)<br /><br />Social Contract is mainly about two things: Interpersonal relationships and money. But what is only mentioned at the very end at the story is Mr. Zuckerberg is a billionaire (actually he's a MULTI-billionaire!) With that huge amount of wealth I couldn't help, but wonder, what is he doing with all that money to make the world a better place? At the same time, I kept thinking about the 18-year old gay college student who recently jumped off the George Washington bridge because someone filmed and then posted his same-sex sexual activities all over the internet. He left his suicide note on Facebook! I hope someone close to Mr. Zuckerberg's reads this review and encourages him to start spending some money on organizations that work to strengthen laws that protect a person's privacy and maybe throw a few bucks to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (GLBT) Suicide Prevention Hotlines around the country, while he's writing checks.

0449000729|4.0|This was my first \\"sweeping epic.\\"  I am not a historian, yet I found this novel to be very enjoyable with the strong historical backdrop.  The novel does a good job of giving a face to the history of the area in which it is set.  My only real critisism is that at times the characters felt one dimensional, as if the character is only a vehicle to get to the next more interesting generation.  Since reading this I have read a two other novels by this author and I recommend this over his other novels.  If you have a interest in a some great stories with a interesting historical side story I recommend this.

B001R4MEUM|5.0|\\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" is probably Genesis's most exciting release. The long list of numbers of varying length and style makes it  an album that you do not easily get an overview of. The story itself (yes, it is a concept album) is not very easy to catch, and personally I was never really caught  by it. It's the music, which for me makes thi a special album. Some of the group's most beautiful compositions can be found on this album. As goes for the previous three albums (Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot and Selling England) a lot of experimenting goes one; especially concerning rock song structures.  These breaks from predictability make Genesis (with P. Gabriel) one of their era's most interesting bands.<br /><br />Of course there are also many songs where the melodic and more traditional songwriting is predominant and it is among these the key tracks of the album are to be found. The songs \\"The Carpet Crawlers,\\" \\"Cuckoo Cocoon\\", \\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway\\" and \\"The Lamia\\" are all well written and performed that they still give a chill down my spine.<br /><br />The short instrumental \\"Hair Restless Heart\\" is a number that contradicts that  instrumental tracks are always a little boring. \\"Lily White Lillith\\" is arguably some of the best rock the band ever recorded.<br /><br />Among the more complex numbers \\"Anyway\\" and \\"In the Rapids\\" are among the favorites. And we must not forget the title-track and the single \\"Counting Out Time\\"<br /><br />Part of music is strongly linked to the context of the album and may hardly work very well outside that context - this applies in particular for  some instrumental passages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Peter Gabriel left the group after this album, and although ithe commercial success continued, much of the magic disappeared with him.<br /><br />Here, several decades after, the Genesis' albums with Gabriel still appear relevant and exciting, while most subsequent albums seem time-typical and less interesting than they seemed in their time.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|\\"Let Me In\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Twelve-year old Owen is viciously bullied by his classmates and neglected by his divorcing parents. Achingly lonely, Owen spends his days plotting revenge on his middle school tormentors and his evenings spying on the other inhabitants of his apartment complex. His only friend is his new neighbor Abby, an eerily self-possessed young girl who lives next door with her silent father. A frail, troubled child about Owen's age, Abby emerges from her heavily curtained apartment only at night and always barefoot, seemingly immune to the bitter winter elements. Recognizing a fellow outcast, Owen opens up to her and before long, the two have formed a unique bond. When a string of grisly murders puts the town on high alert, Abby's father disappears, and the terrified girl is left to fend for herself. Still, she repeatedly rebuffs Owen's efforts to help her and her increasingly bizarre behavior leads the imaginative Owen to suspect she's hiding an unthinkable secret.    The cast led by Kodi Smit-Mcphee (as Owen) & Chloe Grace Moretz (as Abby), who, both give, excellent performances, is excellent!

The costume design by Melissa Bruning is excellent!    This is an excellent and well-made movie that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time, as well as heart racing. This is one of the best horror films of the year, if not, the best. It is also one of the best films of the year, so far. This is also an excellent remake that is faithful to its original, \\"Let The Right One In\\" (2008).

0749399570|5.0|I was given this book by my 8th grade social studies teacher when I was 13 years old, on the eve of my 30th birthday this book is still a treasured favorite.  The complexity of the relationships between the daughters and their mothers is compelling.  The histories of the mothers are telling and heartbreaking.  This book will take you to a different place and time, give you a look into lives where tradition and culture can crush you or set you free.  As a person of few words it is hard to describe my long history with this book, I guess the most prudent thing to say is thank you Mrs. Potter.
0823013626|5.0|This book is awesome! I'm a long-time polymer clay lover, and though I know the basics such as conditioning, curing, safety, tools, and a few helpful tricks, I never really knew how to achieve all the amazing effects true clay artists use. Now I do.   This book covers a variety of effects, such as the three-dimensional illusion, several different image transfer methods, faux-enamel, and more. And to make it even more perfect, it isn't a project book, and it's not a technical book: it's both. It focuses on teaching you the techniques, but at the end of each chapter, there's a single project that shows you how you can use what you just learned. It's the perfect combination!
1594488843|2.0|'Drive' offers little in the way of new information about motivation in the workplace. Much of the research that Pink cites (e.g., Deci & Ryan), when he cites any at all, has gross flaws in experimental design, lacks external validity (not conducted in the workplace) in this case, and ignores basic behavioral principles that even a new student of behavioral psychology would be familiar.  Most of the basic concepts presented in this book are consistent with the human relations school of thought, which is only really half alive today.  If you want to understand the science of rewards (both extrinsic and intrinsic) and are seeking a balanced perspective on both financial and non-financial rewards (recognition, praise) read Aubrey Daniel's book entitled Performance Management (warning: it's a bit technical, but not dry).  Financial rewards systems typically fail because they are poorly designed and implemented.  In addition to mastering the use of non-financial rewards to motivate employees (and simply to be human), you may also want to read up on the history of \\"compensation\\" and more effective pay alternatives than just paying employees for an 8-hour work day, regardless of how little they produce or how well they produce it (e.g., paying employees for productivity, quality, creativity, efficiency etc).  I'd recommend Bill Abernathy's 'The Sin of Wages'.  Drive is generic!  If we're going to solve workplace problems then we need something more innovative than the same ol' rehashed stuff!

B00000250H|5.0|When I was in high school, I first got into this album on LP back in the mid 90s when my uncle gave it to me. When I first heard this album, I became an instant fan of Janis Joplin. Shortly after I was given this album on LP, I got it on cassette tape, and bought a used copy on CD a few years ago (the CD I got is an original issue containing 10 songs). This Greatest Hits has the best of Janis' work, and is a great start for someone who is just getting to know her musical style. I just read some reviews from folks about this album stating that the sound quality is awful. To me, the sound quality is excellent, the way it should be on CD. Here is what I can say to the persons who were dissatisfied about the original CD issue of this album: it was reissued in '99 with remastered sound and bonus tracks (the same thing about Pearl). If you've already bought the remastered issue of it, then you shouldn't complain. I don't have the remastered CD issue of this album, but I'm certain that the sound quality on that should not displease you. Be happy that this album came out on CD instead of it being stuck on vinyl or cassette.
0439023513|5.0|It's not fair some people are giving Mockingjay 1 or 2 stars because the book was upsetting. It leaves the reader with a hollow, empty feeling, but that is the point; horrible things have happened and its impossible to go back to the way things were before.  If you want a nicely wrapped-up ending with no depth then by all means, please go read the Twilight series.     There is no argument this book is extremely well written and evocative, even if the content is unsettling.

0399156577|1.0|WOW, this book is really a stinker. I've been an NR fan for years and years, and have been disappointed with her last 10 or so novels. I just chalk it up to the fact that the poor woman has written close to 200 books; she has become almost a parody of herself by now. I think her best work was in the '90s, post-category series novels, when she got into writing excellent single-title novels and trilogies.    So I went into \\"The Search\\" expecting it to be a bit disappointing. Instead, I found myself actually grimacing as I read it. The \\"hero,\\" Simon Doyle, is pretty much the WORST antihero I have ever read in a romance novel. What a total @#$ he is! He seems downright abusive, controlling, bullheaded (not in a charming way), and withholding of affection. Fiona, the heroine, is appealing -- except in her scenes with Simon, in which she comes across as an apologetic doormat who is thrilled with the crumbs he sometimes tosses her way. Repeatedly, he grabs her, pushes her, uses foul language against her (and I am a major cusser, so I normally don't have a problem with the f-bomb, etc.)... He even has a would-be-rapist moment when he basically tells her they are going to go inside and have sex, and she says something coy about \\"What if I weren't in the mood?\\" His response is something like, \\"Do you think, if you said no, that would make me back off? Because it wouldn't.\\" Ugh. Disgusting.    I don't know if NR thinks this level of abuse, control, etc., is erotic; but I sure don't. And though her books have been tending in this direction for a while, this one really is a departure for her. Boo. Hated it. I don't think it qualifies as a romance novel. Sure, they get engaged in the end, and say \\"I love you\\"; but for this reader, that absolutely is not enough to make their \\"love story\\" believable, palatable, or anything I can feel good about.

0545140315|5.0|Penny Lane, named for the song, is done with boys. Her heart has been broken by her childhood sweetheart, and so she begins junior year of high school by swearing off boys completely. Her best fried, Tracy, doesn't agree; Tracy begins each year with a new list of boys that she wants to date, and each year the list ends in disaster. Penny does, however, find surprising support from her former best friend, Diane Monroe, who ditched Penny in middle school to date super-guy Ryan Bauer. Diane wants to be more than just Ryan's girlfriend, and Penny's Lonely Hearts Club sounds like just the ticket. But when the club grows beyond the two of them and threatens to start a revolution at their high school, can Penny stay in control? And what happens when the leader of the club finds herself finally falling for the right guy?<br /><br />I loved The Lonely Hearts Club. Penny and her friends are hilarious, and I like that Penny has a normal, functional family (aside from her parents' obsession with The Beatles, of course). Like Kay Cassidy's The Cinderella Society, The Lonely Hearts Club is a story of girl power at its most fun. This is yet another strong debut novel, and I look forward to more books from Elizabeth Eulberg.
0525951652|5.0|Like many book purchasers, I use Amazon as a way to gauge other readers assessment of a book's STORY. It seems that many reviewers are using the review section as a way to air their displeasure over the pricing of books. Most people who use the average rating as a way to make a decision whether to buy a book or not are losing out on a wonderful book due to the agenda of many posters. I don't see people complaining about spending $12.99 for a 350 page book but are completely incensed spending $7 more for almost 650 more pages? Let's all keep the review section for what it used to be and what is has always been intended for: To post your personal opinion on the BOOK, not the pricing. And by the way, not everyone buys the Kindle version, some in fact buy the hard cover. I haven't seen too many reviews complaining about the hard cover.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This isn't Michael Pollan's film, but his comments nevertheless stand out to me. Pollan's logic is irrefutable. Has anyone heard a cogent rebuttal to him from Monsanto or Tyson's or the Iowa Farm Bureau? No, they just fume about how \\"food activists\\" are taking cheap shots at the good and noble and virtuous occupation of farming. Their standard mantra is that American farmers produce safe, cheap, and nutritious food. But they cannot have it both ways--declining to be interviewed and then charging food journalists with unbalanced reporting. They do not answer the hard questions about modern agribusiness (it's not farming anymore) because they cannot.    Two contrasting images stand out for me in the film. One is the image of the coldly efficient slaughterhouse. The other is of Joel Salatin butchering chickens. Are the images morally equivalent? I think not. There is nothing intrinsically evil about slaughtering animals. But the modern mega-slaughterhouse is evil. (Cue Iowa Farm Bureau  rebuttal mantra.) CAFO's are evil. Local processing is the way animals should be slaughtered. (Cue USDA warning on trying this without jumping through their regulatory hoops.) And it isn't just the slaughterhouse that is evil. The whole industrial-agriculture production system is morally corrupt, including the regulatory apparatus. (As noted in the film, the \\"regulatory apparatus\\" tried to close Joel Salatin down.)    I like the end of the film alot because it offers practical recommendations. It is very simple. The recommended action is: vote with your pocketbook. Change your buying habits. Find new food sources. Stop buying what is unhealthy, start buying what is healthy. Buy local.
B003HC8I5M|2.0|Oh dear. I am sure that Phil Collins deeply loves this music and to be fair he makes a decent fist of \\"Papa was a rolling stone\\" and \\"Uptight (Everything's alright)\\". He also frankly admits that this was a labour and love and as such \\"my idea...was not to bring anything 'new' to these already great records\\". The trouble with this statement it that it begs the question why record them at all or more importantly what additional dimension is the selling point for this? Doing an X factor style run through of these great songs as an exercise in reverence is laudable but as a scintillating piece of music it falls flat. Carole King's \\"Going back\\" has been better covered by other artists not least of all the lovely versions by Dusty Springfield and Nils Lofgren. \\"Heatwave\\" always sounded perfect when performed by the Motown female groups like Martha and the Vandellas or the Supremes, thus Collins is onto a hiding to nothing here. His cover of \\"Jimmy Mack\\" is truly excruciating (although not as bad as \\"You keep me hangin on\\" on the deluxe edition), while \\"Going to a Go Go\\" is so intrinsically associated with Smokey Robinson and the Miracles that any artist would be brave to cover it and Collins voice is just not up to this. Thus for anyone to fall deeply in love with this album they must already be deeply in love with Collins voice since he admits that these are ultra straight recreations of the originals and while the backing musicians playing may be impeccable the \\"shop window\\" is Collins himself. The previous recent take by a white singer on the Motown catalogue by Michael McDonald kind of worked (although not always) but that was fundamentally because the former Doobie Brother does sound like a black singer, with Collins you keep expecting him to break into \\"Abacab\\" at any minute.<br /><br />Having listened to Phil Collins take on the work on these classics of Motown I would remind the new or discerning listeners that Motown Chartbusters Vol 3 remains available on Amazon for under four quid where this transcendent music can be heard in its glory, as vibrant today as it was in the Sixties. If you don't own the originals seek them out and get the most sublime pop music of the 20th century to rank with the Beatles. Finally while I am not overly fond of Brian Wilson's recent covers album of Gershwin songs to his credit he tries something different, alternatively Robert Plant presents a model for older artists to aspire to with his brilliant choice of music for \\"Band of Joy\\". At one time Collins produced an album with his jazz fusion group Brand X called \\"Unorthodox Behaviour\\" which actually rivalled Weather Report in its brilliance (more please) in contrast \\"Going back\\" stands as an exercise in treading water by a very likeable bloke.der four quid where this transcendent music can be heard in its glory, as vibrant today as it was in the Sixties.

B000024D4W|5.0|\\"Meddle\\" is one great album, and still sounds surprisingly fresh after almost 40 years.<br /><br />For the younger listener who might still be discovering Pink Floyd's epic musical legacy, some of the albums which followed on from \\"Meddle\\", notably the 30-million seller \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" from 1973 (which deservedly took the band from the interesting and experimental fringe into something close to a mainstream supergroup) might be a more accessible gateway. \\"Meddle\\" still carries the inheritance of the earlier, more psychedelic and experimental era but the band was starting to find its way to a more structured and disciplined sound, showcasing lyrics driven by the societal-alienation themes which dominated the \\"Roger Waters\\" era up to and beyond \\"The Wall.\\"<br /><br />\\"Meddle\\" divides naturally into different halves of equal length. The original Harvest-label vinyl LP had five tracks on side one:<br /><br />1.  The driving, powerful and essentially instrumental opener \\"One of these Days\\" with an insistent single-note bass motif introduced over the recorded sound of howling wind, gradually overlaid with raunchy guitar, held together by powerful high-register keyboard chords over a driving rhythm: a real rocker with a hard edge and a quirky but short distorted vocal phrase right in the middle: \\"One of these days, I'm gonna cut you up into little pieces\\" - scary psycho, or what?<br /><br />2.  The whimsical \\"Pillow of Winds\\" with Wright and Gilmour providing melodious complimentary vocals and calming down the mood<br /><br />3.  \\"Fearless\\", a slow but powerfully insistent song with a slightly syncopated rhythm whose lyrics express ideas of detached alienation later explored so much more fully in DSOTM (the crowd singing \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" on the soundtrack at the end of the song was the Liverpool Football Club \\"Kop\\")<br /><br />4.  The delightfully upbeat \\"San Tropez\\" with its summer beach-town feel, written and sung by Roger Waters<br /><br />5.  The peculiar and downbeat blues track \\"Seamus\\" which sounds like it might have been recorded when the band was drunk, complete with howling dog on the soundtrack<br /><br />Then side two: \\"Echoes\\", arguably the greatest single track ever composed and recorded by the band. If you've not yet heard \\"Echoes\\" but have heard \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" then you have some idea of the long, slow, predominantly instrumental musical form full of richness and complexity of which the band is capable.<br /><br />\\"Echoes\\" is a classic mood-piece, symphonic in concept and execution. With its theme of the sea, of the eternity of rolling waves and coral caves, it builds from a repeated single-note \\"ping\\" through a slowly-wake-up intro to a gradually more insistent and rhythmic main theme complete with harmonised vocal line; then moves through a thumping, rhythmic instrumental section into a long, spacey, stretched-out mid-section with eerie but simply beautiful electronically-generated whale-song sounds; rediscovers the main theme and builds melodically to a satisfying climax, and winds down with whale, sea-bird and ocean sounds to leave the listener spaced-out and simply awed. Put on the headphones, recline, crank up the volume and enjoy. You'll be won over. It's an all-time great, one of those rare instances where musical virtuosity, a simple but innovative idea, a kind of intuitive, psychic connection between musicians and the confidence to experiment with new sound techniques whilst remaining restrained and disciplined to form, all came together to distil something unique and wonderful. It's a great, unforgettable piece, a timeless treasure.<br /><br />\\"Echoes\\" of course supplied the title of the 26-track retrospective compilation album, which features a slightly edited version of the eponymous piece sandwiched between \\"Another Brick\\" and \\"Hey You\\". However, the version here on \\"Meddle\\" is the full-length, unedited original.<br /><br />If you can't work out what the weird image on the album cover is, it's a close-up of an ear. Nice idea.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|One fears that Ridley Scott is by now so important to the Hollywood money men that the prospect of someone sitting him down and offering advice would be seen as an act of outright hostility. And yet after watching \\"Robin Hood 2010\\" you feel that if only someone had the gumption to go up to him and say \\"Look Rid, you are a great film-maker, you have a huge track record of success but frankly this is a pile of pants and that bloke Crowe's acting is as wooden as the outside privy door\\" then something could have been salvaged from this risible mess. Indeed watching the Orange Commercial ads before the film you feel that Scott may have been one of the hapless directors whose film pitch was victim to the dastardly plans of the shallow, product placement executives who decided what they wanted was a mix of \\"Robin Hood - Men in tights\\" meets \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"! It is true that Robin Hood films traditionally have a license to totally rip up the history book but in this case it was absolutely shredded thus we have a number of interesting new theories and historical discoveries. They include -<br /><br />1. Robin Hood's dad wrote the Magna Carta (we now eagerly await in the UK the theory of Jesse James authorship of the Declaration of Independence!)<br />2. At the tail end of 12th century we were subject to a \\"French Armada\\" who alighted at the English equivalent of Omaha beach in World War II landing craft with oars and then decided that were anyone to make a film of their exploits they would make a pitch for Steven Spielberg to direct.<br />3. The Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire seems to have taken on whole new forms and dimensions in Scott's film where it is a veritable \\"Champion the wonder horse\\" carved onto a small hill<br />4. The English army may have been made up of a range of bowmen from Wales, Scotland, England and Ireland yet their accents were drawn from a hybrid mix of Geordie, Liverpudlian and down-town Brisbane dialects which they had a remarkable ability to interchange at any point.<br />5. It appears that someone had invented the tractor in the 12th century since there were clearly visible tyre tracks in the land in one part of the film<br />6. Peasants in 12th century Nottingham seemed to have a liking for music by the 21st century Irish musicians the Chieftains whose \\"Women of Ireland\\" sound-tracked a dance between Crowe and Cate Blanchett that had all the sexual chemistry of two penguins skidding on the ice.<br /><br />Throughout the whole film the most sterling acting performances are given by the trees in Sherwood forest. Thankfully Scott found no place to introduce Morris men but every other cliche is thrown in not least the never ending scenes of fat friars drinking mead, buxom wenches cavorting or actors singing terrible folk songs. Cate Blanchett acts with all the verve of a women suspicious that her real life husband may be having her watched by a private detective and as a result is determined to do nothing of consequence to upset him. The film's villain British actor Mark Strong oozes about as much evil as a Sunday afternoon church village fete, what poor William Hurt is doing in here is anybody's guess and don't get me started on the bearded imp who played King John. It is Crowe however who gives them all a master-class in bad acting. It is a performance so destined for a Golden Raspberry award that if I were William Hill I would stop taking bets immediately. Indeed if it came down to a choice of Crowe or the cartoon Fox who played Robin Hood in the 1973 Disney classic a fair case can be made that our furry friend manages with ease to outshine portly Mr Crowe in every room of the acting department!<br /><br />Clearly Scott's thinking on all this was with all the movie's pyrotechnics that we might not notice the wafer thin storyline and to be fair if he had sewn together the battle scenes and played down the clich&eacute;d dialogue (\\"cometh the hour cometh the man\\" - OH PLEASE!) he might have got awaywith it. Sadly at some two and a half hours plus this film is a tedious and bewildering slog and makes Scott's previous lowpoint \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\" look like a Fellini. By the end of the a film we were threatened with a sequel (no Ridley no, we beseech you!) at which point I was so fed up the temptation to get up and shout \\"Vive la France\\" and sing the Marseilles was almost irresistible.rs plus this film is a tedious and bewildering slog and makes Scott's previous lowpoint \\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\" look like a Fellini.

0399156577|2.0|Anymore, I don't know what to think of NR. There was a time I couldn't get enough of her. Honest Illusions, Public Secrets, Sacred Sins, the SeaSwept series, to name a few of her older ones.  I even enjoyed the Blood Brothers series. But anymore, I'm skeptical to buy one of her books.  The last few, I haven't been able to finish.  Luckily, I got this one from the library. I quit reading Danielle Steel years ago, when she got too predictable, when all her characters were alike, all rich and glamorous, same thing, different book. The same is happening with NR.  All her male characters are real hardasses. So are the women. None of the characters can speak in complete sentences, and sometimes I can't make sense out of what the heck they're even saying. Everyone is ultra-strong, emotionally and physically. The women are experts on their men, know them better than they know themselves, and the men are the same way.  And then, of course, there's the sex. Hard, clothes-ripping, animal sex, all the time. I'm not a prude, but where the heck is the romance? And, as in so many of her other books, we get an in depth lesson on some kind of skill. All the dog training bored me out of my skull, and if that would have been edited out, the book would have been cut in half. What is with that? We knew she was a dog trainer, but did NR have to work the whole dog-training manual into what was supposed to be a romance-suspense type story?  And then there's the suspense.  The whole story centered around this maniac who is out to get her (well, that and the dog training). And when we get to the big climax of the story, it petered out badly.    I don't know. Anymore, big name authors are beginning to disappoint, and in a big way.  I've already stopped buying Linda Lael Miller's books, who I once loved, and Sandra Brown is hit or miss anymore too.  Nora Roberts has turned into a bore, as well.  I think I need to find some new authors, because I'm tired of spending money on duds. I have to wonder if these authors even get edited anymore, because I can't imagine an editor reading some of this work and thinking it's good.  I think their books are published simply on their name, but that cheats us, the buyers.  When we see a big name, we expect a good read.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I purchased this book soley because it was a recommend from Amazon.  Enjoy is not the best word to use, however I enjoyed reading this book.  The characters where well developed.  I feel like I know Jack.  Reading a book from a 6 year old's eyes was very interesting.  I wanted to know more about life outside of the room and this is not that type of book.  The struggle is actually life in the room.  Great book none the less.  This is a great book for a part 2.

When I melted the candy melts it turned out too thick and when I tried to dip the cake pops in it, sometimes the cake ball broke off entirely and if I managed to get it out, it would be thin in some places and thicker in others. I tried the cupcake pops and when I attemped to shape the cake balls with a cookie cutter the cake ball tended to break and half and make quite possibly the ugliest cupcake shape I have ever seen. I love Bakerella and her website, but this book didn't live up to my expectations. But maybe its just me. However, the plain cake balls were delicious!
B003UERZ88|5.0|I'll agree that they aren't your typical Metal cheeseball lyrics, but heaven forbid someone write about a few offbeat topics... You know though, if anything, this album proves that Rob Halford is definitely one of those singers that could sing about ANYTHING and make it sound good. For the life of me I can't understand all of the negative reviews, as I'm enjoying this record just as much as any of the FIGHT material as well as CRUCIBLE and RESURRECTION!! So far this has been my favorite album of the year, heck, becoming my favorite of the last two years. If you're a true Rob Halford fan, you'll buy this album and love it, if you're a negative person who's stuck in the past and loves to chop things down and criticize things, you'll make fun of this album and miss out on a great record... Meanwhile, I'll be rocking out.. Rob Halford, what a guy.... Very happy metalhead here!! It's been a while since I've bought an album this good... Halford is the Metal god!!!
B0006GAI6Y|2.0|Ignorance is bliss.  I'm pretty sure that if I did not see the Japanese version first, I would have enjoyed the American version a little more.  The American version is very light fare.  The movie has its good moments, but on the whole it isn't a great movie.  All the performances were okay.  I just wished Jennifer Lopez didn't look so...constipated.  Yes sexy as usual, but in trying to look distracted she missed the mark for me.  But I am comparing Mrs. Lopez's performance to the Japanese Version's counterpart.  The Japanese version was a longer movie, and the characters were well established.  Here in the American version it was like \\"quicker, faster, cheaper\\" but not necessarily better.  But of course if you didn't see the original, you probably came away with a better liking of this movie.   C'est la vie!

0545157617|3.0|This book was one of my few disappointments this year. The illustrations are okay, the story is okay, but it was not great. The story is that of a Stick man who gets chased by a dog, then thrown in a river. All he wants is to return home to his family.

Why do you need to use bombastic words and confusing sentences and story to blur out the history fact! my god, make my life suffer, i have no idea what are the points the author's trying to make, plus the history teacher who really dont care about teaching, i m gonna fail my test!
B00433TO52|5.0|This is the reason I love having Kindle!!! The fact that I can have a huge Shakespeare collection with all of his plays in it and I can carry it around with me and read it anywhere I am is so cool! As for the collection itself, it is Shakespeare of course, so it was going to be great stuff anyway, but its also so amazing that I now have a whole bunch of his plays that I've never even heard of before, and carry them along with me too! Just scrolling through them and seeing new characters and stuff makes me think how amazing this modern digital age is. They are really cool! I think this kind of electronic collection in our modern digital age s really making it a great time to be alive!
0385341008|1.0|Every now and again (thank heavens not too often) the rave reviews on amazon dupe me towards a book which turns out to be a disaster.  This is one of those times - the only redeeming factor of my relationship with this boring book was the fact that I did not pay for it.

B003UERZ88|3.0|I like many others on here, think Halford is one of the best metal vocalist of all time and was so looking forward to this release. However I'm with those who believe this effort is lacking in solid riffage. Where's the driving guitars, the pounding bass lines and solid beats? To my disappointment, it's not found anywhere on here. Yes it has some moments, but not enough of them and that's my point. Truthfully theirs not one tune that really stands out and grabs hold of you. It's really quite boring and certainly not what I was expecting from the Metal God. Honestly this CD is lacking passion in a big way. Maybe it's the mix, but for what ever reason it just dosen't grab hold you. I love the man's body of work, no pun intended, but this one is lacking. The one positive note is that Halford can still sing like theirs no tomorrow! Amongst a cd of rather mondane tunes that is indeed the one bright spots here.<br /><br />Accept's new release is 100,000,000 times better than this one as it's got balls! Maybe that's what it's missing, balls! Anyhow go buy the Accept cd instead of this and while your at it, pick up the remastered Crucible release as it sounds amazing now.<br /><br />I gave it a three stars simply because Halford has my respect, anyone else would have got a one. Disappointed best describes this one unfortunately.

Can't stand another long winded page of nothingness drawn out into more nothingness in a bunch of nothingness lives. This is the most boring book I've ever read, no matter what anyone tells you. What hype! I bought it before Ms. Oprah made her selection. Well, lots of luck to her devoted readers. I'm on to something a lot more interesting.

B003EYVXUU|4.0|If I had not seen the original version, Let the Right One In, from Sweden about a year ago, I probably would have given this top notch remake 5 stars. The dark script and characters are still fantastic this time around, but it's almost an exact copy of the one that came before. The last horror film I remember that followed almost scene for scene from the source material was Psycho, and we all know how that turned out. At first I was trying to think of a reason why they would remake an already good/great movie so soon, but I guess they thought most audiences in the U.S. wouldn't want to read the subtitles that the foreign version had to offer.<br /><br />The story involves a 12-year-old vampire girl who befriends a neighbor boy, while her loving \\"father\\" has to kill people and bring home blood for her survival.<br /><br />Chloe Moretz is even more impressive here than in her breakout role as Hit-Girl in Kick-Ass. There is just something hypnotic about her acting. When she is on screen, your eyes are transfixed. I can see a Jodie Foster like career for her, if she doesn't go the Lohan way. Kodi Smit-McPhee was up to the challenge as well. They share some great chemistry. You rarely see one good child actor performance in a movie, let alone two. Richard Jenkins didn't have a major role as the father figure of the vampire girl, but he fit the mold nicely.<br /><br />I liked the atmosphere and creepy visuals even more in this version. The kills were also more quick, brutal and bloody. Some people seem to be complaining about the CGI (which isn't used much anyway), like when the vampire climbs up a tree, but I hardly noticed. The music was okay, but could have been more memorable. I liked the way Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Burnin' For You\\" and The Greg Kihn Band's \\"The Breakup Song\\" were put to use.<br /><br />Let Me In is easily one of the top five films I've seen this year. I think you will enjoy it more if you don't see the original first, but they are both equally great (maybe a slight edge to this one, especially if you don't want to read), so I'll let you decide. You're welcome.especially if you don't want to read), so I'll let you decide. You're welcome.

0553805371|4.0|Surely, believers will be happy reading chapter \\"7. The Apparent Miracle\\" and also the final chapter, \\"8. The Grand Design\\", where the authors combat \\"The Apparent Miracle\\" with support in the \\"Game of Life\\", in their words: \\"An example that can help us think about issues of reality and creation is the Game of Life, invented in 1970 by a young mathematician at Cambridge named John Conway.\\" (page 172). Then, after detailing the game, they amazingly ponder: \\"In Conway's world we are the creators - we choose the initial state of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start of the game.\\" (page 179).   Wouldn't one might say: Wow, I thought this is a fair approximation of the role of the Creator (God, First Cause, whatever).   Doctor John Conway is to be congratulated. After all, the eminent Professor Hawking's current 2010  fresh conclusions are supported by his 1970 \\"Game of Life\\".

B003LL3NOK|3.0|This is the sequeal to \\"Diary of the Dead.\\" You don't need to see that film to understand  this film and perhaps both films should be avoided. The movie has the typical shots to the head to kill zombies as well as exploding heads and a few unique ways to kill zombies which have become known as \\"deadheads,\\" something they could only get away in post Garcia days. People finally get the right idea and go off to an island to avoid the endless streams of zombies. However, this island, Plum island, has its issues. The island, located off Delaware is inhabited by two feuding families with Irish accents (go figure). The unlikeable leader of one family wants to shoot zombies in the head, while the other wants to pen them up and wait for Jesus to show the way. For some reason I found myself cheering for the zombies. The writers took a bad plot and did everything they could to make it worse short of writing a role for William Shatner. It has George Romero's name on it, you know you are going to watch it anyway. Besides, you've seen worse zombie movies. But hey, I warned you not to expect too much. There is a token, lesbian with her hand in her pants, masturbating scene for some reason.
1423113381|3.0|This was a hard book to like, but also a hard one to dislike.  I would love for amazon to have a rating for 2 1/2 stars, because that's what I would give it, Red Pyramids goes right down the middle.  It's the follow-up to Rick Riordan's wildly popular Percy Jackson series, which apparently is going to be continued too.  I should mention that despite being similar in themes to Percy Jackson, none of that 'verse's original characters pop up here.    The premise is this:  Brother and sister combo Carter and Sadie Kane are involved in supernatural hijinks galore.  Magic, Gods, fire, and baboons are all over the place, and the entire thing reminds me of an amateur making Cajun Gumbo:  Some bites will be awesome, and some make you want to spit it out.  And that's the thing, it's a gumbo like story, with tons of ingrediants and detail.    First the Kanes:  Carter is 14 years old, black, and travels the world with his Egyptologist father (Julius, also black).  Sadie is 12 years old, white, and lives with their dead mother's parents (also white) after Ruby Kane is killed mysteriously a few years before the events of the book.  The Kane siblings are not close, and see each other rarely, until the plot puts them together for the story.  They each narrate the book in the first person, mostly alternating chapters, though sometimes one will do a pair of them in a row.  It's an interesting way to tell the story, and unlike many negative reviewers I didn't mind it.    I did mind that the Kanes were often difficult to tell apart on the page, though Riordan (or likely his editor) helpfully put the name of the narrator on the sides of the pages to assist us.  But their tone and cadence was mostly the same, though the Brit raised Sadie did throw in a few token Brit slangs.  Carter, who in theory should have been in his element in  this kind of story, is portrayed as rather clueless considering, while Sadie was given 'natural' powers to make up for her lack of background in the subject.They kind of reminded me of Ron and Ginny Weasley, without the other five siblings.  Don't worry, they're not knock-offs of those characters, nor are they dopplegangers for Percy, Grover, or Annabeth (thank goodness).  But they were a bit on the boring side.  Plus, making them drastically different pigments may have led to a few good Sadie insults towards strangers looking at them funny, but is unrealistic enough that it just distracts you.  The supporting characters are unmemorable on the whole, other than Khufu, the basketball playing baboon.  Yes, you read that right, and he was hilarious.    The book is essentially a road book, whereby the Kanes go to one place, have their lives threatened, escape with just information to get them to the next life threatening situation, and move on.  So it did lead to a lack of jeopardy, you never got the sense that anyone's life was really in danger, at least either of them anyway.  Plus, it's the beginning of a series, and nobody truly important will get knocked off until the third book, if even then.  But as a primer to Egyptology?  Pretty good, and I learned a lot of interesting little things, it taught me more than the first two Mummy movies did at any rate.    Will this work as a series?  I don't know, though the final chapters laid plot threads all over the place for the next book.  A new enemy, unwelcome allies, and possible romances for both Kanes will likely be in the next one.  I would ask that Riordan, pretty please, not drag out the romantic tension(s) like he did in Percy Jackson and JKR did in Harry Potter, both took the 'will they or won't they' bit of it more than a little far.  Plus, like Lost, dead characters in this series will likely never truly be 'dead'.    It will be interesting to see how he continues this series, given that, as I've said, he's got another Percy Jackson series ready to go.  I'm giving Red Pyramids three stars, and not two, out of my fond memories of Percy Jackson.

It hasn't left my camera since I purchased it.

B00003CXDB|5.0|I was delighted to see that this film was available on my pay-per-view cable because I hadn't seen it when it first came out.<br /><br />Briefly, Michael Douglas is an unscrupulous Wall Street tycoon who bends and breaks the law.  He takes young Charlie Sheen under his wing and we watch Charlie change his moral principles, grow rich, bed blond and beautiful Daryl Hannah and seem to become a younger version of his mentor.  But then, Michael Douglas goes too far when he tries to take over the airline that Charlie's father works for and Charlie has a change of heart.  All this is carried out at a breakneck speed and even though it is hard to follow the specific details of each deal, there is no problem following the concept, memorialized by the phrase \\"greed is good\\" which seemed to describe Wall Street back then in the eighties and especially describes it today.<br /><br />Oliver Stone directed this film and his extreme talent made it a winner.  There are a million little special details that gives it a real \\"zing\\" and it is so fast paced that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  I look forward to seeing its sequel now, hoping that it will be as good.
0385342047|3.0|How else do you explain her antics in this book? She's always been a bit, well, not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but in this book she's downright stupid! I agree with all of the reviews saying her relationship with Minnie should have been different. Instead of parenting the little brat, she just gets all flustered and eventually gives in. (OMG, I just NOW understood the title; \\"Mini\\" as in small and \\"Minnie\\" as in the name of her daughter, but not sure how it ties into the theme of the book).    Becky, in this book comes across as more self centered than usual. Given now that she has a child, you'd think she would be more maternal. Nope. Not a chance. But I have to give Kinsella credit. She knows her character well and Becky acts like most of the single woman that I know. Especially the ones that are only children. Spoiled to the hilt, and thinking that the world owes them everything. Entitlement should be their middle name, and Becky's too.    And the lying. It seems like her life would have been a whole lot easier, if she would just stop lying. We're supposed to like Becky, not want to shoot her.    Basically this book is about the planning of Luke's birthday party. So it's page after page of \\"I Love Lucy\\" like situations, with Becky \\"accidentally\\" breaking Luke's Blackberry. Or using (and I do mean the word USING as in taking advantage of) Luke's assistant for her own gain.     On the plus side, Kinsella is still one of the only authors who make me laugh out loud. I love the minor characters in this book. The parents are a hoot, and I do love the Jess/Becky story. And Suze is still great.    Obviously there is going to be another book, given how this ends. Will I buy it? Yep! Just have to remember, this is fiction and it's supposed to be brainless. I'd like to see a book written from Luke's point of view. He divorces Becky and get's custody of Minnie, claiming she's unfit to raise a child. She and Suze can just hang out like they did in the first couple books.

B004386KUY|5.0|Santana takes advantage of covering some classic material to show off his very impressive guitar skills. I read some of the reviews on here and a lot of people feel like this is a Rock Band-ish type album; I have to disagree. The singing is good for the most part, Chris Cornell has the perfect voice for covering 'Whole Lotta Love' originally sang by Robert Plant. 'Riders On The Storm' is one of my favorites, Santana follows the mellow groove of the song nicely adding his unique sound and technique that sets him apart from many.      If you enjoy great guitar work and Classic Rock, this is the album for you.

B00180R06I|5.0|This is my first time viewing what is considered a Vampire masterpiece and for me, it truly is a great film.  Carl Theodor Dreyer, the director of that other masterpiece, The Passion of Joan of Arc, created a great vampire film.  It apparently was lost after it was made and the film was put together from partial prints found in France and Germany.  The restoration was completed in 1998 apparently.  Not all the film is there but a great movie exists.  Wish I was a kid again to get my wits scared out of me.  What a wonderful atmosphere this movie has.
0446569895|3.0|I'll try to keep this short and sweet. \\"I Am Ozzy\\" was a fun book to read for fans of Ozzy. I was a little worried that this book would be a family friendly version of his life in order to cash in on the people that are fans of his reality show instead of his music. Well, that's not a problem here. He doesnt hold back. The book contains many drug and booze references that make you laugh without glorifying them. Like other people have said, this book aint for the Peta crowd, either. If you want to read tales of crazy Ozzy, this is the book for you.    The book does have it's flaws, though. He warns you as much in the intro. Memory loss and blackouts did take a toll. The most glaring example was a story he told about a concert that he played in Tyler, Tx. I actually grew up in Tyler and was a kid when Ozzy was booked to play there at The Oil Palace. I remember it like it was yesterday because that was a pretty big deal for the Prince of Darkness to be playing a show in my crappy hometown that is located right in the heart of the Bible Belt. In the book he says he played the gig, went out on the town till 7 a.m, and then got into a brawl with a coffee shop full of Bible thumpers the next day. I can assure you that this episode did not take place in Tyler. First of all, the concert never happened. It got cancelled. And there is no out on the town till 7am in Tyler. Tyler is in a dry county. All the bars close at midnight. Ozzy has his facts scrambled. In a previous chapter, Ozzy mentioned some show in Texas that had been cancelled due to bomb threats involving stloen explosives. That was the Tyler show. That one cancelled Tyler show was the only time Ozzy was ever booked in the city. So who knows where the coffee shop brawl with the religious right actually happened? And who knows what other facts were skipped or confused because of the drug haze?     All things considered, I enjoyed the book. If you like Ozzy, you WILL like the book. The 388 pages will go by very fast.You WILL laugh. Some of you might want more details. I doubt that the Tyler story was the only one that has lost its accuracy over the years. After reading this book, we are lucky that the dude remembered anything at all.

080214473X|5.0|i distinctly remember seeing the news reports that something had happened in Somalia, i9 recall the warnings of graphic images, followed by video of a dead soldier being dragged through a dusty street surrounded by a cheering crowd.  i also recall that the story effectively disappeared.  A year later and people didn't seem to remember that anything happened in Mogadishu at all.  Then Mark Bowden published this book.  It is easily the most accessible work in the field of military history, partly because Bowden isn't an historian.    There are some flaws, some parts of the narrative seem far shorter than others (due to how much info could be had from each soldier interviewed), some assertions are based upon the impressions of the participants and may not reflect the actual situation (ranger impressions of the 10th mountain come to mind), and some elements of the task force are almost ignored in the narrative (the SEAL contingent, the Airforce Combat controllers, etc.).  but overall this work provides a fine framework for understanding the events of Oct. 3rd 1993.    for personal accounts, i would recommend reading [[ASIN:0345466683 The Battle of Mogadishu: Firsthand Accounts from the Men of Task Force Ranger]], and [[ASIN:0451219937 In The Company Of Heroes]].  but really these books should be read as a set, as each provides different impressions of events, and the feelings of the participants; so that together they provide a more complete picture of how events transpired.
030745455X|4.0|If you've read the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo then this book is a must read.  It is a good follow-up to the first book, and it kept me wanting to know more. I can't wait to read the 3rd.
0439023513|3.0|The first two books of this trilogy were fun, the first more so than the second, but I was never a die-hard fan like most. I was intrigued most by the potential of rebellion that was foreshadowed from the start. The Hunger Games was a symbol of the wrong that needed to be righted, and this book, Mockingjay, was the potential answer.<br /><br />This book was as much, if not more, violent than the previous two though I could excuse it easier because the game was for real this time. Still, the depths some characters go to enslave and cause pain to others strains believability. I don't know if this version of the human race is worth redeeming. I was satisfied with how the larger story was resolved, and especially how the author showed the damaged results of the very-flawed Katniss, but I was irritated how the story arrived at its conclusion. Too many plot corners and motivations were glossed over or cut entirely so when the BIG moments happened I felt, at best, confused and, at worst, cheated.
0670021652|1.0|I really don't understand.  Maybe I have to have been through a divorce, or really be a marriage skeptic to like this book.  Not sure, but I am sure that I thought it as terrible.  The writing was bad, the advise was even worse, and I felt as though Elizabeth repeated everything a million times throughout this book.  Bad story that I will not be recommending to my friends. So disappointed I purchased this book and now have it as a part of my library.

0920668372|5.0|I have read this book to my two children since they were very young.  I even made up a melody for the little song!  It's got a tear jerker ending & a message about treating your elderly parents right that I hope will stick with my kids forever, because that's how long love lasts.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I thought this was a beautifully filmed and acted movie. The beginning is a little confusing if you're not aware of all the details; my husband and I had to rewind the dvd several times in the first 10 minutes or so until we were sure of what exactly was happening, but after that it was marvelous.

144140841X|5.0|In my book club we recently had a discussion about reading books again that we read in our youth, like Treasure Island, 1984, Animal Farm, Great Expectations, The Catcher in the Rye, and Lord of the Flies. Since I never read Treasure Island as an adolescent, I decided to give it a try. It is absolutely delightful!  It is a tale worth reading. Robert Louis Stevenson's prose is appropriate for youths or adults and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep the reader on their toes. The story is rich in detail and intrigue. Stevenson is able to develop character with a few details, as does Charles Dickens. Quickly we empathize and identify with the feisty, clever, honest boy Jim Hawkins. The pirates are great. They are such a lousy bag of scum and Stevenson has the ability to make them evil and also individuals, a real skill. We also learn the tale through the eyes of an adolescent boy. This is a wonderful technique used by Salinger in Catcher in the Rye and used by Mark Twain in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  This technique is powerful in that it allows the character as well as the reader to encounter characters and situations with naive eyes and thus must use native intelligence to separate lie from truth, safety from danger. While the boy main character is trying to figure out who to trust, the reader is also.   Jim Hawkins is a likable boy and Stevenson has a sense of the physicality and movement and energy of boys. He has Jim engaging in physical activities in which an adolescent would undertake in an emergency that an adult might not. This feature helps explain the popularity over many years of this book for adolescent males. Jim, the son of a terminally ill tavern owner and his wife, is exposed to the pirates when Billy Bones comes to hide out in their remote tavern and inn. Immediately Stevenson lets us know that some adults are not to be trusted and are of low, dangerous character. That is another great aspect of the book since it doesn't sugar coat adulthood but allows Jim to see adults as a mixture of virtue, foolishness, greed, and homicidal intention.  The Squire Trelawney and Dr. Livesey are examples of realistically developed adults, sometimes foolish and sometimes heroic. Another fine aspect of the book is that it is about recognizing, understanding, and counter-acting treachery. The character of Long John Silver is wonderful. He would be classified as a psychopath by today's psychological standards but when written, he was very evil and very smart, a deadly combination. Without giving away any of the plot, Jim must outsmart Long John Silver just to survive and thus the tension developed by character and an economical storyline makes the book a real treat. The book deserves to be considered a classic and deserves more than 5 stars since it is an enjoyable classic, the best combination.

B003U0AHBO|3.0|This film gave an amazing and beautiful impression of 12th century England. The art direction and cinematography could not be better. Life in these times was rough and even the King of England lived in conditions that were very primitive by today's standards. Therefore the attention to detail in architecture, clothing, furniture, and landscaping was a treat. This film has also received a good deal of criticism for historic inaccuracies. However we have to remember that the story of Robin Hood is fiction and thus has been fair game for novelists, cartoonists, comic book writers, and film-makers. Therefore the best advice I can give you is to enjoy the storyline, enjoy the acting, enjoy the action, enjoy the 12th century world created on the screen and don't worry if this version does not match the other versions of Robin Hood. Likewise, don't worry if the historic characters do and say things that are not historic fact, just enjoy the film as entertainment.  Most all of the versions include some aspect of the conflict between Richard the Lionheart and his younger brother John.  Robin Hood usually plays some role in support of Richard and in defiance of John. Also, the Crusades will play a role in a Robin Hood story for it is the absence of Richard during the Crusades to the Holy Lands that sets the plot for the conflict between the brothers. In this version, King Richard, played by Danny Huston, is returning from the Crusades and is storming the Castle Chaulus Chabral in Normandy. Russell Crowe plays Robin Longstride, an archer, who has served Richard during the Crusade, is present at this siege where Richard is mortally wounded. Robin and his comrades become involved in a struggle when Sir Robert Loxley, taking the crown back to England, is ambushed by the villain Godfrey, a double agent working for the French King while claiming to be Prince John's best friend. The siege of Castle Chaulus Chabral offers some stunning scenes but the back and forth dealing and doubledealing as the physical crown is in jeopardy. Loxley is killed and Robin promises to return the crown as well as return Loxley's sword to his aged father. The character Godfrey, played by Mark Strong, may refer to the middle brother, between Richard and John that did double cross his brothers with the King of France in the film The Lion in Winter. However in this version Godfrey is not a Prince. Mark Strong has recently played some great bad-guys. He plays the nemesis of Young Victoria and the downfall of Tristan and Isolde, two great films for English history fans. Robin takes the crown back and gives it to Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine who then crowns her son John as King of England. Eileen Atkins plays Queen Eleanor as the all suffering mother who uses strategy to keep the ship of state afloat. Atkins plays this hard and wise old lady role well and she was fantastic in the film Vanity Fair. Robin then goes to Nottingham to return the sword to the aged Sir Walter Loxley, played by Max von Sydow. Max von Sydow is an institution and legendary actor who plays this role to perfection. To preserve the estate for Lady Marion Loxley, Robin must pretend to be her husband returned from ten years in the Holy Lands. Cate Blanchett plays this role perfectly.  Blanchett's performance will remind you of the wonder performances of Katherine Hepburn, full of power and grace. There is another sub-plot around the Magna Carta and the rights of men in England and the role Robin's father played in developing these concepts and the role Robin now plays in executing them with the current King John. King John was played by Oscar Isaac. King John is not a sympathetic character in most films.  In this film he is also a double crossing fellow but he is a handsome young vital man rather than an old strategist.  John Hurt has the role of Sir William Marshall, a wise courtier of King Richard who had helped defend and manage the nation while Richard is away.  Matthew Macfadyen plays he Sheriff ofNottingham and Kevin Durrand plays the massive Little John. Overall this film is good entertainment. It was not meant to be an accurate history lesson.

B000FCK8ZK|2.0|I thought this was a tedious book to slog through.  It wasn't fast-paced enough for me.  I got tired of the repetition. It was interesting to read a story from a psychopath's point of view. (I label Dexter that because he is a killer, albeit of people one could understand, for the sake of the story,need to be killed.) I bought the book for my Kindle because my teenage son had been bugging me to watch the t.v. show online.  I thought he would enjoy the book, once we had established it wasn't based on the t.v. show.  I read it, but I won't read another one unless the vast, vast majority of the reviews are 5 stars and I get it from the library.  To do otherwise would be a waste of my time and my money.
1427210497|3.0|This is a review of the unabridged 19 audio cd version of Jonathan Franzen's novel, FREEDOM.<br /><br />Listening to the stories of Walter and Patty Berglund--and the stories of their children, Joey and Jessica, as well as their friend Richard--took longer than usual. It took longer, not because there are 19 cd's in this set, but because I kept pausing in my listening, taking a break from dialogue that was mundane and tedious.<br /><br />The author's examination of American middle-class life, and the struggles of his characters to live with their past mistakes, and with their changing society, was for this listener, an exercise in patience, because the characters simply did not engage me on an emotional level.<br /><br />The characters (one and all) came across as secretly spiteful individuals who, beneath their achieving, bourgeois exteriors, suffer from some sort of low-grade depression, and who take their \\"struggles\\" in life entirely too seriously.<br /><br />All in all, I thought the story an ultimately sad examination of the question: \\"What is the price of too much freedom?\\"<br /><br />There have been some very thoughtful, detailed (some glowing), reviews of the book, and perhaps the nuances in the printed novel would have made it more enjoyable for me. But for this version, I can only give three stars.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community has got to be the best new show from last year and this DVD set makes it even better.  The outtakes alone would be worth the price.
B003UERZ88|4.0|The leading characteristic of this album is its diversity. As a fan of his first album \\"Resurrection\\" I expected solid rockers and  straight likable tunes. They are there but sometimes they are buried. Yes there are a few moments that are sometimes difficult to follow. But all in all Halford delivers. The guitars commanded by Mike Chlasciak and Roy Z are sharp and dangerous and musicianship is tight enough. Go and get this one.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|I've been a Clapton fan ever since I got the album Heavy Cream back in the mid 70s. This album is great. The arrangements and musicianship are superb. My favorite track is Autumn Leaves. Eric's playing is phenominal. I wish he'd do a whole album of standards.
0316010669|4.0|\\"Blink\\" is a book about our cognitive abilities. Malcolm Gadwell considers the ability of the human mind to make split second decisions and judgments, which are usually accurate. He delves into the idea that our instincts are usually correct, even though there are no fundamental reasons why then goes onto convince readers that snap judgement and first impressions can be controlled and educated. He writes about the term \\"thin slicing\\" to describe the ability to find patterns in events based only on narrow windows of experience.     Overall \\"Blink\\" provides a new sort of perception that first impressions and judgments are actually true. From childhood, we are all taught that first impressions are key. Malcolm Gadwell provides evidence of split second Decisions and judgement ranging from a retired tennis player, to Medical Doctors. Gadwell does however, explain that prejudices can impair our thoughts. Gadwell even describes how the outcome of a relationship (Divorce or Married) in 10 years, can be quantitatively measured.     The overall theme is \\"Thinking without Thinking,\\" which describes that ones mind can subconsciously understand and analyze a situation before one's conscious takes place. The mind can conceive the details through a situation due to the associates made through society. Gadwell jumps between stories as a describes different topics such as priming, selective processing and expertise, but always relates back to the topic of thin slicing. His writing style leaves the reader curious as to why and how something happens, subconsciously urging them to read on till he abruptly explains the relationship.     The overall book was a pleasure to read, yet I still remain skeptical about some of the ideas and presented. He present's ideas that have many different outcomes, such as how an artists who should have made it big didn't and how a commander beat his opponents in a war-game exercise. The book hits individuals with facts and then goes on to describe the relationships found within those statements and facts. I remain skeptical about some of the ideas because they simply seem implausible and rather controversial.  Since the earliest days of our birth, we are taught never to make judgments or to judge a book by its cover.  Blink teaches us something different, describing how it is alright to judge a book by its cover, and how those judgments actually save us a tremendous amount of time.     Gadwell relies mainly on anecdotal evidence.  Each section tells a story about someone who illustrates his theory of snap judgments.  The first story presented was about a Greek statue the J. Paul Getty Museum had agreed to purchase.  Just before the transaction was about to take place, two art experts immediately knew it was a fake. They had no idea why, or how they just \\"knew.\\"  Eventually it was found out that the statue was a fake and when a scientist tested a sample of the stuate, Gadwell explains that \\"In the first two seconds of looking--in a single glance--they [the critics] were able to understand more about the essence of the statue than the team at the Getty was able to understand after fourteen months.\\"  As the book progresses, much more of this intuitive knowledge is proven to be true.     The main problem in the book is that some of the information is presented in a falsify way. The readers are not given completely background of all the other possibilities. In one example, Gadwell explains how artist by the name of Kenna, is loved by artists, managers, and talent scouts but fails to make it in the big run because radio stations dislike him because he didn't market himself properly to them. Individual people thin sliced Kenna and realized he was good, but radio stations waited some time to make a rational judgment which in turn led them denying him. Gadwell explains that Kenna could either have been promoted, or the radio stations are wrong, but never does he touch on the fact that Kenna might have been a bad artist.I would highly recommend this book to other readers, simply because of the way it makes you think about your judgments. I was able to finish this book within a day because of the intriguing logic Gadwell uses to prove his point. This book made me step back and think \\"Wow. Can that be true.\\" It truly made me think of the decisions I make on a daily basis, and how some of those decisions are already determined.  While I do remain skeptical about some of the idea's presented in the book, the overall book was a pleasure to read; keeping me entertained and curious enough to finish the entire book.  I enjoyed the book enough to go and purchase Malcolm Gadwell's other book \\"The Tipping Point.\\"      Overall, read it and enjoy how much it makes you think.  One should not however take everything said in the book to be the truth.
0553386816|2.0|I was really disappointed with this book and particularly resentful of the fact that a review right on the cover stated that it was \\"the best writing John Grisham has ever done.\\"  It simply is not true.  I think that I've read every book that the author has written, and this is far from his best.  The stories are just average at best, and while I realize that they are short stories, character and story development is sorely lacking, and each story just left me cold.  I purchased this book versus getting it at the library, and I really feel ripped off.  If you're a Grisham fan and feel compelled to read this book, I highly recommend getting it at the library.
B000FC12Z0|1.0|This ebook was horrible.<br /><br />Words ran together, and if that wasn't enough, entire lines of text were missing.  How is one supposed to enjoy any book, much less a mystery novel, when parts of it are missing?
0765328321|5.0|The Fall of Reach tells the origin story of Master Chief Spartan 117.  This version is a re-print which takes the original version, supposedly corrects some of the mistakes and adds new content.    If, like me, you already have the original version and are wondering if it's worth buying this as well ... I am undecided.    I have read the original about 5 or 6 times, have the rest of the books in the Halo series too, I've played all the games on X-Box and X-Box 360 and am a HUGE Halo fan.  When I heard this was being re-released with corrections and new content, I was hoping it would be re-written so that it would fall in line with the story told by the game, Halo Reach.  Sadly, it does not.  There are some glaring discrepancies between the two story lines which could so easily have been corrected (I'll put them at the end of the review just in case you would/would not like to know what they are).    Furthermore, the new version still contains errors (i.e. it seems like they have run a spell check but did not proof read the book so, while there are no spelling mistakes, you come across the odd word that is out of place ... but at least you can guess what the word is supposed to be).    I am undecided about the new content.  It is basically a series of random excerpts, letters, memos, etc stuck on at the end of the book.  I have only read them once, and while some of them feel like they tie in with other parts of the Halo storyline, I cannot pinpoint how or where.  There are also a few pictures dotted about the book too.    If you are new to Halo, or have never read the books before, I cannot recommend the series enough.  The Fall of Reach, together with Contact Harvest are my personal favourites.  The Flood is also a good read as it closely follows the events from the first Halo game (Halo: Combat Evolved).  If you have not read or do not own the original version of Fall of Reach, this is the version for you as, I guess, it is the most complete version.  If you havealready read or own the original version then hopefully what I have written above can help you decide whether or not to get this version too.      ****** SPOILER ALERT ******                                There are a few discrepancies I noticed between the book Fall of Reach and the game Halo Reach.  They are as follows:    * The Pillar of Autumn - In the book, The Pillar of Autumn is constructed in space dock and this is where Captain Keyes first enters it.  In the game, the Autumn is planetside.  * Cortana - In the book, Cortana is already on board the Autumn whereas in the game, Noble 6 brings Cortana to Captain Keyes, who then flies her to the Autumn.  * The Spartans - In the book, all bar one of the remaining Spartans (it says in the book that one of them was unable to be recalled due to the mission they were on at the time ... I think this could either be Jorge, who is part of the Halo Reach storyline ... or Kurt as he is off on the Spartan 3 program ... read \\"Ghosts of Onyx\\") come aboard the Autumn before going off on their respective missions.  In the game, there is no mention of these Spartans ... apart from...  * Spartan in stasis??? - On one of the final cutscenes of the game (where Captain Keyes' pelican boards the Autumn), you can pan the screen to the right and you'll get a glimpse of a Spartan in a stasis chamber.  Now, I guess this is supposed to be Master Chief.  If it is, this does not appear to tie in with the book as, per the book, the Chief does not go into stasis until after his mission to detroy a NAV database, which takes place after the Autumn first launches.    I have a thoery ... a very thin theory ... so thin it's anorexic ... but ... could it be that the Autumn does originally start off in space dock with all Spartans and they go off on their respective missions.  Then, somehow, after picking up the Master Chief and Linda (which could mean the Spartan in stasis is Linda), the Autumn has to go planetside so that Cortana can be uploaded with some vital information that is too risky to be transmitted in case the Covenant intercept it.  Cortana gets taken to Dr Halsey who uploads the information to her, gives her to Noble 6 who then returns Cortana to Captain Keyes. The Autumn then takes off and does a slipspace jump to Halo.    The way the book was written, the above does not seem possible ... but at least it would help bring some continuity back.
B003HC8I5M|5.0|With Going Back, Phil Collins not only recreates the sounds of classic Motown, but just as importantly, the mood. This album is flatout fun and one of the best roadtrip companions I've ever had. I even smile during the ballads...Collins nailed it on Blame it on the Sun and I Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer and those are NOT easy songs to sing.  There's only a handful of albums that I've encouraged friends to buy...this is one of them.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|All I can say about this film is that it has a great story and it will move the audience to tears and want to get up and fight against terrorism all over again. Nicolas Cage, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Maria Bello did some of their best work on this film. A film with Heroism and a powerful drama telling the story of the true lives of many who paid a dear price on 9-11.
0385342047|2.0|I, like another reviewer, loved Twenties Girl and since I've been reading Kinsella since 2003 I decided to pick up her newest. What dreck!!! Beckys character is obnoxious self centered and idiotic. Halfway through the book I was secretly hoping Luke would finally divorce her and put them both out of their misery. So angered was I, that I even threw in a tiny curse for Minnie, their supposed demon spawn. Sophie tried but this book is the most dismal in the whole series. I only wish I was there to offer counseling to her irritating protagonist.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|First and foremost, I need to emphasize that this film works on so many levels it is difficult to isolate the separate strands of knowledge that we acquire in the viewing. Animals, animal husbandry, women in cattle country, autism, engineering, the scientific method, animal behavior...I could go on and on. I have learned so much about so many things that I will be reading spin-off books based on this film for a long time.<br /><br />I was entranced by this very intelligent handling of a life that stands as a model for those who are different in mind and body from most of us. The intricate visual approach to autistic sensitivity, and the demonstration (rather than explanation) of the coping mechanisms that enabled Dr. Grandin to achieve what she has, are absolutely stunning. I've read the book, and this is a wonderful experience that enhanced rather than replaced the reading. If you loved this movie, by all means read \\"Emergence\\"!<br /><br />I must also mention the remarkable scenes with cattle and horses, demonstrating Temple's gift of understanding the behavioral cues given by the animals, which most of us never see. Temple actually enters the mind of the animal, allowing us to see as the animal does, and understand why they behave as they do. Rest assured that there are absolutely no scenes that would be considered disturbing to animal lovers (such as myself) in spite of the nature of her work in the cattle industry. I had many \\"aha\\" moments, and no look at my dog a little closer when she wants something and I do not understand.<br /><br />Clair Danes disappears into the role, she has so taken on the persona of Temple Grandin...an Oscar effort for sure! Her work is a stunning example of the craft of acting.<br /><br />Do not miss the extra DVD feature, \\"The Making of Temple Grandin\\". Not only will you see footage of Dr. Grandin herself, you will understand how Director Mick Jackson decided to approach the difficult task of making her thought processes acessible to the audience within the film. His approach presents the autistic mind as a an intellectual asset, rather than a defect. He also uses this extra feature as a means to assure the audience that the animals in the film were either animatronic robots or actors, and suffered no trauma in the filming. A thoughtful touch.<br /><br />Anyone who knows someone with Aspergers in particular will benefit from watching this film. They will understand much more about the inner life of Aspys and be less afraid of the social impairments and perhaps more understanding of the intellectual gifts that are the other side of Aspergers.he film.

B001TODCII|5.0|This is a good example of a movie that keeps guys like me interested and rooting the hero. I don't know how long the movie is, but the time raced by BOTH times I watched and I never wondered \\"How long does this last?\\" in a frustrated stew as happens in too many other movies. Superbad Dad goes after the bad guys for the duration. He sees all and knows all so don't expect a documentary because it's not real and it's just for fun so enjoy. It's kind of therapy for someone who feels that there is too much injustice in the world EXCEPT maybe in this movie. Missing is gratuitous: sex, bloodletting, foul language, America-bashing. So enjoy and entertain with TAKEN!
0385532458|1.0|I'm normally a big fan of Grisham. I have most of his books and recommend them to others. I was eager to read Ford County. But his 'new' writing style and characters are tacky at best. Gloomy, seedy, depressing, and what others think is hilarious barely made me smile. I have read and enjoyed most of his books tremendously. I'm now plodding thru this book and am on the third story. The first short story 'Blood Drive' was awful. The best I can say about it was that it was short. The second 'Fetching Raymond' wasn't as bad as the first but still not good. The characters were just that...characters... blah characters with no redeeming qualities. I was hoping this book would be more in the line with Playing for Pizza, which was funny, fast paced, and a really good lighthearted read. Unfortunately it didn't come close!
0143036556|2.0|I am very interested in the topic of this book, but the book itself is overly long, meandering, and generally a boring read. Which by the way was my opinion of Guns Germs and Steel, except that GGS was even worse. Diamond clearly shows his leftist bias on several occasions, i.e. when discussing Montana, Los Angeles, Haiti, or the Dominican Republic. The length of the book is crushing, and the author repeats himself a lot, e.g. when discussing the Vikings in Greenland or New Guinea's natives. There are also plenty of irrelevant details which should have been edited out to shorten the book and make the narrative tighter, e.g. how the Inuit (eskimos) hunt seals or whales (and I mean, every detail is described: what kind of leather or wood implement is used and how).    On the bright side, if you can put up with its length, the book does describe various environmental problems and how some civilizations succumbed to them and how some others changed course and survived. The monumental environmental problems of Australia and China are also well described - two sections that I found very interesting.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love, love, love Wicked. I have seen the play twice and could see it twice more if given a chance. I just had to have the CD of the songs, all of which are wonderful. I've probably played this CD enough times to wear it out.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I'm probably not the most huge sci-fi/fantasy fan so you can take my opinion for what it's worth however you wish. I recently learned about the series on Hulu ([...]) and watched the episodes from Season 1 there. My take is that it's a well-produced, well-directed body of work that explores themes and dynamics of human life such as relationships and the battle of good versus evil, etc. more so than the fantasy aspects of the genre, although the fantasy elements are there. The series is pretty fast paced and generally not boring so that is a big plus in my book. Another plus is that the series is a hero-based tale the likes of which is uncommon in current television. The episodes felt more like mini-movies and at the end of the first season finale, I was left wanting more. I wanted to see what happens to Richard (The Seeker) and Kahlan (The Confessor) next.     Based on what I saw of the first season online, I believe the \\"Legend Of The Seeker\\" series will stand the test of time because it deals with timeless themes and as such, recommend them to anyone building or adding to their video library.
1595822003|5.0|This book should be on the shelf on anyone who considers themselves and lover of illustrative art and great literature!  The story of Frankenstein as crafted by Mary Shelly is a work of literary genius and then add to it Bernie Wrightson's fantastic art and you have a MASTERPIECE in your hands!  Though it should be noted that this book is quite dense and is not by any means a comic 'picture book'.  This has more the feel of an old illustrated classic from the late 1800's.  But, very well done and beautifully presented in this handsome hard cover edition.  A MUST HAVE!!!

B002ZG97V0|5.0|The Owls of Ga'Hoole is one artistic movie of such beauty I nearly cried for joy at the animation. I have an art degree too so for someone who looks at (ROBERT BATEMAN) books (SEE HIS ART) I am quite picky at my art. (VIDEO GAME)\\"Game Informer Magazine\\" wrote a 5 star review for it, and they tend to rip some people a big one not so much in always a good way due to their standards! The story is for all ages as my family kids from 3.5 (and the 3.5 yr old is starting to learn concepts), to grandparents who liked it and felt it was calming for the blood pressure, to thirty and fourty year olds with 2-3 teenagers went as a group in my family. Kat got over her fear of owls. It is the classic struggle between right and wrong, good and evil, light and dark.  Teachers and students in this story (it really is a good book series and movie for kids who are in school as the principals are good in it) and represents the will to keep fighting and going forward as well as good leadership, teamwork, family, and social networking examples.  The owls even have schools of learning.  I want them to come out with an art book really bad! Soundtrack is good and I wish I would have wrote this book series as it is something the author in general fun and learning should be proud of.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|Great Movie, but the packaging is very basic. Filmsy construction, one page insert, etc. The DVD arrived in great condition within two days, five days faster than what I signed up for! For those who want an experience unmatched by other Batman movies, this is the one! The Joker character has a very hilarious and some what scary aspect to him more so than in previous films. I wouldn't recommend  this for youngsters but for the 18+ crowd, its a hoot! For those who just want the movie and not the special features, pick this one!
B00000J9HE|5.0|These 1960's recordings of Sibelius symphonies and tone poems by Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic are definitive performances of 4,5,& 6, and near the top of the list for the rest. The Fifth symphony in particular is without doubt the most thrilling performance this work has ever recieved on record, and I've listened to many different versions including Ashkenazy, Barbirolli, Bernstein, Davis, Jarvi, Rattle (his Birmingham version is 2nd best), and others. Listen to the way the tension builds and releases in the final movement,always following the line. There simply never was and probably never will be an orchestra that produces the sound this outfit makes here.   The Fourth is as dark,brooding and mysterious as this score demands. It recieves an intensely gripping treatment. The Sixth is simply gorgeous, although Karajan's EMI account is superb as well. As for the rest of the works here; the Seventh is only let down by an out of tune section near the beginning, (otherwise it too is glorius), Finlandia is probably too kitschy but that goes with the writing, and Tapiola sounds better in Karajan's digital account. Even still, this is a great version.   Karajan's artistry has come under fire from a lot of critics: Too smooth, too mannered, too glossy, soul less, etc. I could see justification in this with some of his later work from the eighties. But not here! There are a great many versions of these works out there (some really outstanding such as Barbirolli) but no one served this music better than Karajan and the phenomenal Berlin Philharmonic at the peak of there powers. I think it will be obvious what the composer meant when he said \\"Karajan is the only one who understands my music.\\" What a shame they didn't record the mighty Second Symphony, but for that you can turn to Toscannini's riveting RCA Victor recording.   All prejudice aside, in Sibelius, this set is to be purchased first and without reservation. Everything else is just, well, not quite \\"the best.\\"

0060005696|4.0|A group of us (men and women) read THE PARADOX OF CHOICE for a book discussion group.  We liked the book's thesis.  Most of us have gray hairs on our head and felt that the conclusions drawn by the author were validated by our own experiences, insights, and conclusions.  It was interesting, however, seeing some of the science behind the insights.  At times the book is repetitous or goes on too long about the obvious, but all in all a worthwhile addition to literature about how much our subconscious and conditioned behavior control our actions.

0786956291|5.0|Okay, here's the deal: Essentials is basically your intro D&D. Its not 4.5, its not a reboot, its not a new D&D. It is essentially 4 edition \\"basic\\" but with a more younger age appeal. Its your starter set for kids. Everything you need in one red box of goodness. It has all the rules, tables, dice, counters, cards, maps, (beautiful btw) and character sheets you need to start playing right out of the box within 15 minutes of opening it. Full color, easy to read, quick to follow and fun even if you dont know the first thing about RPG's or fantasy gaming (although most kids today are familiar with computer RPG's and World of Warcraft). You also dont need DDI, you dont need Character Builder or miniatures. You also dont need a battlemat to play. If you are wondering what to get your little brother, cousin, sister, niece, or son/daughter, then this is it. Introduce them to a world of imagination that is easily playable by most kids today. Its easy to follow and it even introduces solo play to help you decide if you should be a fighter, wizard, cleric or rogue. Yes, for those of us who are old timers, this box set hearkens back to the old D&D red box with the cover by Erol Otus and Larry Elmore.<br />To be clear, this box set is not for your veteran D&D player. This is for newbies or kids totally new to the D&D experience. Its entirely introductory, not the full game itself. Of course, for many of us this is what we started with when we were kids, then we *graduated* to the hardcover rulebooks. If you are like me, have played D&D in any previous incarnation, or have played other table-top RPG's then you are better served going straight to the Players Handbook, Dungeon Masters Guide & Monster Manual hardcovers.

0312600844|5.0|The logic that drives Jonathan Franzen's \\"Freedom\\" is people have an urgent compelling need to compete against each other, and competition is the manifestation of the intense love-hate relationship people have with those closest to them.  Like all simplistic statements, this is so abstract and nebulous, all-encompassing and so undeniable that it becomes a truth.  There are many simplicities and irregularities, understatements and overstatements, questions and doubts that emanate from \\"Freedom,\\" but so compelling and powerful is Franzen's writing, so total is his ability to construct a narrative superstructure that locks the reader in to marvel at the internal complexity, diversity, and nuances of \\"Freedom\\" that the reader can only accept the beauty and power of the book on its own terms.       Jonathan Franzen is the most talented, brilliant writer of his generation, and this can neither be negated by his tremendous commercial success nor by the fact that the person is, from what I've heard, a complete prick.  It takes a man of tremendous drive and discipline to write a book as sprawling and as ambitious, yet is as fine and as detailed as \\"Freedom.\\"  There are many flaws with the book, flaws that I think are more symptomatic of his age and immaturity as a writer (he is 51, which means he has another ten years before he fully peaks) rather than his lust for commercial success.  Yes, the book is very commercial - the book will indubitably be turned into a 5-part Emmy-awarding television HBO mini-series, just like \\"Empire Falls\\" - but the book is also striking and insightful, poignant and uplifting; in other words, it's the closest thing I've read to literature from a  modern author in a long time.     Once again, the book is about competition.  Patty's competition with her spoiled, overly nurtured siblings in a limousine liberal Westchester household drive her into playing basketball at Macalester, and instead of diving straight into the arms of a tall cool self-hating musician (whom her family would have embraced) she opts for the cool embrace of a shy awkward self-hating lawyer.  The musician and lawyer are in fact best friends and roommates, and while they profess to love each like brothers they could have been in love with each other if they were not so pre-occupied with competing against each other.  They keep score, even if they refuse to keep score, and at middle age it seems that Walter (the dorky lawyer) has won over Richard (the cool musician) because Walter has channeled his self-hatred into protecting Patty and raising their two children, renovating their family home, and trying to save as many animals from as humans as possible and Richard is just another unemployed misunderstand musician/carpenter.  But then Richard sleeps with Patty, Walter eventually finds out about it (after years of self-denial, which is what his second love besides self-hate), and finally admits it's about keeping score - and so he throws Patty out, and ruins his family.      Because this is a Jonathan Franzen production, there are no sympathetic characters in this book, and that's what makes it both so exhilarating and at times so uncomfortable to read (I always cringe when the characters are about to fall into bed with each other - a profusion of extreme emotions in a book that's nothing but the profusion of emotions).  Patty is confused and messed up, slightly because she was raped as a teenager and her parents insisted she keep silent about it but mainly because Walter enables her to be confused and messed up.  Richard is cool but he's also a prick.  And Walter, who more than the Patty is the protagonist of this novel, is so obsessed with his self-hatred and self-denial, his own insecurities and weaknesses that he constantly seeks his own destruction and downfall (he was the one who made it possible for Patty and Richard to cheat on him, even though the warning signs were obvious to all).       That the characters are not sympathetic is certainly a flaw for a mainstream and commercial audience, but what's even more annoying is how the novel is mainly \\"American Beauty\\" and the allegory of suburban decadence and decay and for the last ten pages it's suddenly \\"Leave it to Beaver.\\"  Darkness suddenly turns into light, and I can see why readers would be upset with Franzen with turning a somewhat commercial book that they can appreciate into a totally commercial book that their neighbors and siblings can appreciate (again, it's that dark penchant for competition invidiously snaking its way through everything).  And like his previous novel \\"The Corrections\\" (which I also enjoyed), \\"Freedom,\\" after a strong literary start, quickly devolves into absurdity and black comedy.    But what's undeniable is how Franzen is sympathetic and sensitive to his main characters, as though they all live in him.  He can see, smell, hear, and feel the world they do, and that really is his signature and his genius as a writer.  I especially like how his characters constantly try to reason out of a certain behavior even as their body propels them into that certain behavior (this is the way I behave, and I think it's true for just about every well-educated human being - an expensive liberal arts education does not mean we behave any differently from humans, just that we're able to add in play-by-play commentary in our heads as we're doing what we know we shouldn't be doing).      \\"Freedom\\" is not genius, but it's proof of Franzen's potential genius.  Franzen has yet to write his masterpiece, but more than any other writer I've read so far he seems to have that intense drive and discipline (he's so assured of his immortality that he'll do everything to obtain it) necessary to write that masterpiece which will change everything.

B003UYV08E|4.0|\\"Iron Man 2\\" finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), billionaire owner of Stark Industries, very much out of the closet as Iron Man. He's enjoying the notoriety that superhero status has given him, gloating about all he has done for humankind in the past few years. Actually, his behavior seems out of control, and personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is increasingly frustrated by Tony's self-destructive antics. Little does she know that the palladium core of the arc reactor Tony wears is slowly killing him. Meanwhile, the US government is demanding that Stark turn over his Iron Man suits to the Defense Department. And a new rival, Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is building his own arc reactor to avenge an old score.<br /><br />The \\"Iron Man\\" franchise continues to distinguish itself from other films based on Marvel Comics characters with its sense of humor. These are action-comedies that, perhaps ironically, also have the strongest socio-political subtexts. Leave it to Robert Downey, Jr. to play crazy, funny, and heroic at the same time. Sam Rockwell is an inspired, not necessarily obvious, choice to play Stark's arch-rival in business Justin Hammer, CEO of a rival defense contractor. Director Jon Favreau has done a great job with the visuals and managed to find the right tone as the film vacillates between high-octane action and slightly hammy comedy. \\"Iron Man 2\\" isn't as strong as 2008's \\"Iron Man\\", partly because introducing the SHIELD organization into the mix creates too many characters.<br /><br />I'm not a reader of comic books, so the introduction of characters from other storylines seems odd to me. I understand that comic books do this a lot, but it can be problematic in a 2-hour film, where maintaining focus among a change of CEOs at Stark Industries, a sinister plot involving a Russian scientist and rival businessman, a crusading senator, a military friend who may be foe, a drunken and desperate hero, and a lot of explosions already presents a challenge. Scarlett Johanssen is probably fine as SHIELD babe Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff, but I can't say that her action scenes were convincing. Other than that, \\"Iron Man 2\\" is a lot of fun and is happy to be over-the-top in everything it does. And its sly jabs at the defense industry are pretty funny.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2010 single disc edition): The single disc offers an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau. He talks a lot about his decisions, what he chose to do or not to do and why, the reason for the sequence at the beginning of the film, themes, what was included or had to be left out.

B00005JLEX|5.0|Early seasons of Seinfeld are very entertaining as you glimpse the beginnings of a great sit-com run.  The characters you came to love are all there in 4 or 5, 20-minute episodes per DVD and the characteters are probably younger than you remember (but then again, aren't we all?).  Hilarious musings about nothing are the hallmark of this series which continue to delight audiences.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|Wonderful movie. First saw part of this on a transatlantic flight back in May 2010. Only caught the end of it so was waiting for it to come out on DVD. Great story, great acting, a real keeper. Made my husband watch it (even tho he hates real life/dramas) and he was really moved by it. What I love is how it gives you a perspective on the world of autism. How Temple's emotions are portrayed contrasting to what is going on around is very cleverly executed. I have never considered how hard it would be to enter through a automatic sliding door if I were autistic; just simple things we do every day aren't easy for Temple and I think the movie did a great job of illustrating that. One of the best movies I've seen this year.

0312600844|5.0|After reading his towering novel THE CORRECTIONS, you may well have thought Jonathan Franzen had nothing that good in him to come.  I certainly couldn't imagine it.  Oh, how wrong I was.  FREEDOM, his towering NEW novel is definitely as good as his last great novel; in some crucial ways it may even be better.  It doesn't make me love THE CORRECTIONS any less, and much of what is amazing about that book is true here.  Truly messed up family?  Check.  Hilarious and scabrous writing about big, big sadness?  Check.  Narrative playfulness evidenced by turning the lens on another character just when you are on the edge of your seat with a different one?  Check.  A title that keeps rattling in your head as its meaning keeps changing before your very eyes.  Check. A last line to haunt you?  Double check.  But even more than before, here is also a politically minded novel with bright spotlight-like observations being made about the messes we have made in the last ten years.  It is a novel of RIGHT NOW; maybe in 10 or 20 years it will also be a magnificent chronicle of this time, but the effect of reading it today is one of terrible recognition, on every level, of what it is to be alive in the United States in 2010.  You will savor every single page of this big, big book, and if you're anything like me, you will simply not want it to end.  Whatever will he do next?
B003UYV08E|3.0|This would have been a great sequel but the casting sucked. Don Cheadle is an outstanding actor but he detracts from this picture. His acting was very wooden and it was obvious he was only looking for a paycheck. Terrence Howard would have been so much better continuing the roll. There was no interaction to develope any relationship between Cheadle and Downey's characters. As a reult Cheadle seems like an ass. To have him suddenly be an ally doesn't flow. Totally miscast and destroys any flow from the first movie. Cheadle tries to start by being sympatheic but their is no idication he is continuing Terrance Howards character. There is a no interaction until he's pissed because Tony's celebrating his birthday and steals the Warmachine suit. (What and ass)  To have him suddenly be Tony's best friend at the end of the movie doesn't jive(He's his best friend and he's never seen Tony drunk? Seems to me it happened several times in the first movie. So he's pissed enough to steal the most powerful weapon in the world? Something his best friend created and has nver abused? Good movie but very disjointed and Don Cheadle ruined this film. Great actor but totally miscast in this film. May have been a **** movie but Cheadle sucked!!!! The action is very disjointed and the movie has no flow. Unlike the first movie this one seems to count on Robert Downey's charisma to carry the film. He is actually the only reason to watch this film. The action is lacking and the plot is very weak. Another movie that tried too hard.Terrancd Howard would have made it a four star but they still tried too hard.

B003XMUFGQ|4.0|... and by that I mean, as sleek and as intoxicating as the music from New Orleans, from which this is largely derived. Clapton said years ago that he had wanted to join The Band and make music as exquisite as theirs. With this record he has. From the opening track \\"Travelling Alone\\" through the closer (and I'd suggest the Barnes and Noble version with the bonus song:) \\"Walk with Me\\", this is a gem on a par with his first CD. There are some sophisticated workouts, a brilliant new song that will hopefully send \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" to the bin of history, and a perception on the blues, its origins in the Mississippi Delta, that only a man as suffused with the tradition and spirit of that music such as Clapton could articulate. I tend to avoid his studio albums because apart from Layla, they lack a certain heft that he brings to his live efforts. Not so with this. The man plays with a grace that is inspiring. Considering this alongside Beck's Emotion and Commotion one can see the treasures, depths and textures of a focused intent versus a scattershot blast. I'd highly recommend this disc.

B002OSY2T6|1.0|My nine-month-old has seemed like a lefty for a few months now, and even though everyone says, \\"You can't possibly know by now!\\" this toy confirmed it.  The idea is that the baby will reach out with his or her right hand, tapping the snail's tail, which makes it go.  Then the child will follow it and practice crawling.  But my son reaches out with his left hand, and touches the snail's face.  He lights up when the snail lights up, but for crawling, it serves no purpose.  Touching it with his left hand makes it either stop moving, or it falls over.  I have to return it.  If you think your child is a lefty, this toy will not work.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|This is the essence of a commercial Hollywood movie, slick and professional on the production values, shallow on the ideas, and a bit of ad-hoc environmentalism thrown in to curry favor with the LA politically correct set who decide Academy Award nominations. The real star of this movie is the computer of course - Cameron spent a boatload of money generating graphics in groundbreaking 3D. I haven't seen the 3D theater version, but the home Blu-Ray is spectacular enough. Wondrous synthetic imagery. How do they do it, such convincing imaginary beasts and foliage from another world?? The best part; swooping around the treetops and waterfalls on the backs of flying dragons. The digital wizards who created this - Wow.<br /><br />But all the imagination is with the computer programmers. The producers settled for a simple-minded story line, just an updated version of Rainforest Indians versus Evil White Exploiters (EWE) Who Want Their Minerals. The Indians ride around on fantastically imagined space-horsies and actually chant war cries; Yip Yip Yip, like Apaches in a John Wayne movie. I noticed with puzzlement that the Indians (OK, Navi) are called Great Warriors - they carry long bows and 4' arrows - but it is never made clear exactly whom they make war against since there don't seem to be any other tribes. We only see them in defense mode, worshipping the Great Tree and being all touchie-feelie with The Spirit of the Forest. And morally superior to the wretched EWE's, who are cartoon villains with no redeeming qualities. Just bad, bad people.<br /><br />Of course there is a love interest. The EWE sends a guy, and the guy falls in love with a squaw. Who wouldn't fall in love with this squaw, she's nine feet tall, blue, long long hair, and eyes as big as bowling balls? She does have a weird nose but it seems to run in her family, and everyone is too polite to mention it.<br /><br />And of course Sigourney Weaver has made a career of being brave whenever scarey monsters are around. And Michelle Rodriguez is the same sexy tough chick as always, on any planet or century, so long as they have helicopters and guns and she can bust some caps. This shows that tough babes with guns will still be there in the far future, which I found comforting.<br /><br />So watch this for the amazing computer graphics - but all the talk about its cosmic meaning? Give me a break.<br /><br />OK now, let's try to envision the sequel - at least one is said to be in the works. I see the story picking up after the Navi drive out the EWE and have a pow-wow where they realize that mining Unobtanium on their own is not such a bad idea after all. There are roadblocks - galactic regulators who throw a lot of environmental red tape in their way, but the Navi hire some high power lawyers and manage to strip mine the rainforest. This pollutes their planet of course but hey, they become wealthy, trade their dragon-bird rides for black Cadillac Space-Utility-Vehicles with tinted windows, the whole bit. Now we know that in the long run, Indians want only one thing - casinos - and the Navi are no different. So they build the biggest casino on any world - a fantastic Las Vegas of the future - with giant rainforest hotels (\\"Pandora's Box\\") built over that waterfall. And very tall blue cocktail waitresses in skimpy outfits who bring tall blue signature drinks in tall blue glasses (Nav-tinis) made with exotic fruits and atomic vodka, right to your gaming table. Soon Pandora becomes known throughout the galaxy as a wide-open planet .. even a few Nav-a-Ho's cruise the casinos whispering if anybody wants a 'Blue-Job.' A Blue-Job? I won't even speculate what that might mean. What happens on Pandora stays on Pandora.driguez is the same sexy tough chick as always, on any planet or century, so long as they have helicopters and guns and she can bust some caps.

B003HC8I5M|5.0|This is the best Phil Collins album since Dance Into The Dark.  He does Motown very well.  With Lamont Dozier giving a helping hand, PC couldn't go wrong with this one.  There are two songs on this album that were not Motown songs.  One was \\"Do I Love You\\" a hit for the Ronnetts in Phil Specter's Wall Of Sound.  PC does a brilliant job on this one.  Nothing like a Phil Specter song with a Motown touch to it.  The other song, which melted me, is an old Byrds tune \\"Going Back\\".  I was in total awe when I heard PC's version.  What a beautiful way to close out a Motown album even if the song wasn't Motown.  I never did like Papa Was A Rolling Stone and I couldn't sit through the entire PC version.  I think PC did a brilliant job with these songs but Going Back really grabbed me.  The Byrds version was beautiful and PC makes it even more beautiful.  If you're into Motown, then this is the album for you even if you have the original versions of these songs.  The unfortunate thing about this album is that he could have included You Can't Hurry Love, a hit for him a few years ago.  But all in all, this is a brilliant album whether you like Motown or not.
0143036424|5.0|So far 30 pages in this is a big yawn.  The author has a  certain turn of a phrase and Wyoming fauna, flora  and geology are deftly captured.  But, the sherriff ( a 4 year widower)  is large, fat, depressed and mostly crying in his beer when not having panic attacks.  I hope things pick up from here.  So far our chief sleuth is sluggish, verbose, laconic and unsure.  I hope CJ is setting the reader up for the protagonist to rise to the occasion like a Phoenix.  I am 138 pages in and not enjoying the cowboy prose and the small town chatter.  The plot is that years ago there was a rape of an Indian girl who was retarded like the fact pattern of Glen Ridge, New Jersey a few years ago.  Could the Indians be out for vengeance by a murder served cold?  I am hoping this book can be redeemed; but after more than a quarter of the work I have serious doubts.  OK at page 225 this turns into a rip-snortin' page turning pot-boiler that I cant wait to pick up.  CJ gets tired of playing chatty cowboy.  sherriff Walt quits mooning over some rich, spoiled, dried up puss and explodes into action.  He cold cocks his deputy for exhibiting a nasty S & M streak.  The bodies start to pile up.  The last Buffalo rifle from Custer's Last Stand shows up as a possible murder weapon.  This is good stuff.  It was a 200 page wait; but hopefully the weepy, depressed, slow moving, chatty, fat sherriff is only in the rear view mirror now.  The Lone Ranger and Tonto goes badass new age; with a dash of weepy, chatty Kathy thrown in.
0316010669|4.0|Just finished Blink, I read it in just 2 days which is very fast for me.  It's a very good book. Most of the stories he uses to convey the ideas are interesting and valid, and much of the information is incredibly intriguing.  I would have said the book was excellent but something happens to the author about half way through and all the \\"Oooo, Ahh..Awesome\\" gets clouded with the author's obvious liberal views, and the previous astounding theory and fact is replaced with righteousness and opinion. The ending was anti-climatic, and my copy had the add additional afterward which I read hoping for a little better closure, but ended up with more opinion.  The entire book is still very good the content is valuable, and I believe most people I know will enjoy it.      I recommend it to anyone in management (decision making positions) or anyone simply interested in how the mind works. It is not so much a book to train you to think in the blink of an eye, as much as a book to make you realize your mind already does that and how to be aware when those thoughts are valuable or not.

B003L45JLW|5.0|I LOVE this Blu-Ray!  I am a huge fan of this album and I listened to it over and over again (via itunes download) before I went and saw them on this tour.  I received this Blu-Ray after I had probably listened to this album about 70 times.  What a revelation!  I do not have super-high end equipment (My speakers are Definitive Tech Pro Satellite 100's - about 10 years old, just to give you a hint.) but I did play this through an Oppo BDP-83.  Simply put, either through the stereo or surround mix the Blu-Ray audio puts you in the studio!      If you have a blu-ray player and surround system get this disc.  You will not regret it.
B003ZSI9YI|4.0|Phil Collins' brand-new album, \\"Going Back\\", is what it is---a Motown covers album. Heading towards his 60th birthday, Phil felt that now was the right time to pay tribute to many of the Motown classics that he grew up listening to, so, voila!---\\"Going Back\\". Having waited eight years for a new solo album from Phil, I'm not going to lie when I tell you that I would much rather have a new album of all-new material from the man, rather than wall-to-wall cover tunes (and how strange that Phil's former Genesis bandmate Peter Gabriel *also* released a covers album recently....). But hey, Phil can make whatever album he wants to make. He's already left his mark in music (and he was FINALLY inducted into the Rock'N'Roll Hall Of Fame with Genesis this past March, thank you God), so Phil doesn't owe anybody anything. He wants to do an album of Motown stuff? Fine.<br /><br />The good news, I'm happy to say, is that \\"Going Back\\" is a lot of fun. Phil worked closely with some dudes who helped shape the Motown sound all those years ago---songwriter Lamont Dozier, and the Motown studio musician wizards known as the Funk Brothers. The songs sound pretty damm close to the Motown originals, and Phil sings his heart out. His drumming here sounds a *little bit* watered down, like he's not really firing on all cylinders behind that drumkit. But to be fair, Phil is still in recovery from recent back surgery, and he had to tape the drumsticks to his hands in order to play on this album. Nevertheless, he still adapts his drumming style to the old Motown sound well enough.<br /><br />This Amazon-exclusive version of \\"Going Back\\" gives you seven more songs, for a grand total of 25 tunes! But the songs fly by very quickly. Phil says that \\"Going Back\\" could be his last solo album ever. I'd like to think that Phil still has one more album of original material left in him at least, but if \\"Going Back\\" really is it for this wonderfully talented singer/songwriter/musician, it wouldn't be a bad exit. \\"Going Back\\" was obviously a labor of love for Phil Collins, and it's a fun album to listen to. And hey, it's nice to have *anything* new from Phil at all! So I'll take it. :-)was obviously a labor of love for Phil Collins, and it's a fun album to listen to.

0312600844|5.0|Freedom chronicles a dysfunctional family: the Berglunds of Minnesota, which include Walter, his wife Patty, their son Joey, and daughter Jessica.  We are introduced to them in an engrossing opening two hundred pages, first in a short breakneck summary told by an omniscient narrator, (with writing so good it made me despair to write another word myself) and then in the form of a journal written by Patty at her therapist's suggestion, appropriately entitled, \\"Mistakes Were Made\\".  In these pages, we see the family's problems laid bare: we see Patty's disappointing childhood that included a date-rape and basketball games her politician mother and lawyer father were always too busy to attend; we see her meet Walter in college, a left-wing activist nice-guy she hesitantly and uncomfortably commits to despite being more attracted to his best friend, Richard Katz, a singer for a punk rock band; we see her past and current disappointments played out on her children, especially the bright, easy-going, nothing-like-Walter, and emotionally-closed-to-her Joey; and we see the deterioration and ultimate betrayal of a marriage.    Franzen switches POVs frequently from here, shifting from Richard, to Joey, to Walter, and back to Patty.  The primary plotline here though is Walter's.  Drawn to Washington DC by his deteriorating marriage and a job opportunity, Walter compromises his integrity by working for a Republican billionaire to organize a project that will give him a bird sanctuary he so desperately wants, in return for allowing coal extraction on part of the land via mountaintop removal, an environmentally destructive process.  As Walter closes this devil's bargain, the press begins to get wind of it, ramping up his stress-levels.  How could they not see the good to come out it?  How could they not see that saving the rare cerulean warbler, \\"the fastest-declining songbird in America\\" is worth the compromise?  Despite these obstacles, good things begin to happen for him- he now has the power and connections to talk about his real issue, over-population; he falls in love with his young and as-idealistic-as-he-is aide.  But he's still not happy, and eventually things here fall apart too.    Meanwhile, we follow Richard, who has finally found popular musical success, but doesn't seem to be so enamored with it.  We follow another entertaining subplot involving Joey as he continues to be everything his father isn't by cozying up to a Republican strategist, the father of his best college friend and his incredibly hot sister, who Joey has a crush on.  He then ends up working contracting deals in Iraq that make him bundles but endangers troops.  Young Joey begins to understand consequences and guilt.      In other words, Franzen displays for us the fruits of freedom as he sees them.  He shows us people who have used their freedom to make themselves unhappy.  All Patty \\"seemed to get for all her choices and all her freedom was more miserable.\\"  This is true of all the characters.  And this is a risk for Franzen.  He brings them to places that some people will find abhorrent, possibly even to the point where sympathy is impossible.  This is a tricky area for a novelist to navigate.  But Franzen doesn't seem afraid of tricky fictional territory.        Franzen writes like a nineteenth-century novelist, in the vein of Austen or the great Russina novelists.  \\"...Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,\\" as Tolstoy wrote, and Franzen seems intent on showing us the unhappy families of today, in all the ugly and twisty intricacies that relationships can take.  He shows us Patty's and Walter's childhoods, so we can see where their problems originated, so we can see how problems pass from generation to generation like a disease.  He also loves to linger over the complexities of the human mind for pages and pages, like Dostoyevsky.  As great as these authors were however, they're not widely read by Americans because they are so thick with accumulated detail, as is Franzen.  He's not afraid to tell you what a room looks like.  He's not afraid to take you through the nuances of the mind.  But many readers won't have the patience or inclination to sit through such thick paragraphs, no matter how brilliant the writing.    Also, Franzen's take on society and politics will probably grate on anyone who doesn't agree with his views.  This is another Tolstoy-like characteristic, the penchant to take his small story of a family and toss it into the larger canvas of today's American society.  While I liked the broad implications he portrays, and didn't mind the political axes he ground, I did find him largely less effective in the middle sections, when we're following Walter's story, knee-deep in the problems he sees in virtually every aspect of life.  Often Walter comes off as a crank or misanthrope, and while it didn't bother me, I can see how it would bother a good many readers.  Franzen is much more effective when he's surveying the personal rather than the societal.      But what's important is the story.  Franzen has shown us people trying to muddle their way through life.  They're trying to find the love that will sustain them, or to figure out how to let the love they already have sustain them.  They're human, possibly too human for some readers.  All these characters are tainted to a degree, like we all are.  But what makes this book so wonderful is that Franzen allows them redemption.      With all due respect to fantastic authors such as Kathryn Stockett or Geraldine Brooks, who have written brilliant novels of times past, what Franzen does is what I think a novelist is supposed to do.  They're supposed to show us a slice of life in the times we're living, about today's human beings with today's human problems and how they go about figuring things out.  They don't have to survive unscathed, just survive, with the hint that maybe everything will be ok.  I don't think one can ask for more from an author, and nobody does this better than Jonathan Franzen.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|With FROZEN, Adam Green has written and directed a well above average thriller that will keep viewers biting their nails until the final credits...once the main storyline kicks in.<br /><br />The film, released onto DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment, is a clever variation of OPEN WATER (2003), which dealt with an attractive couple being stranded in shark-infested waters.  In this case, we have three college students who are trapped on a ski lift on a Sunday night with the prospect of nobody returning to the resort until Friday.  To make matters worse, the ground far below them is being patrolled by a pack of very hungry wolves.<br /><br />The virtually unknown cast, particularly Emma Bell, does a fine job of making their characters  multi-dimensional, and Green is a certainly a director who knows how to build suspense.<br /><br />On the other hand, the film contains several gruesome scenes.

0525951652|5.0|[Revised review as pricing has now been corrected]    Price is a critical component of any product, even a book, and for the price, this book delivers poor value.  The pricing of the Kindle version is amazing high and therefore, this book as a whole deserves no more than a single star.  I love Ken Follett and his books but this is just wrong.  As of the time of writing this review, the Hard Cover is cheaper than the Kindle edition.  To all of those who say this review is unhelpful:  -What is the marginal cost of an electronic book? -As customers of books, would we rather have cheaper books with all existing parties making the SAME amount of money? -Should customers use the leverage they have in setting expectations among publishers for electronic book pricing?  In any other case, I would agree with many of you and mark this review unhelpful as well, but I think in an age where publishers have huge &#34;price setting&#34; control and customers only have power through reviews of the product, there is no alternative, I think.  We've seen this with Yelp as well where consumers get a lot more power to demand better value because customer reviews are visible to all.  That's all this is as well.

Those resourceful rabbits had aerial attacks, surveillance patrols, raids, search & destroy missions, psychological operations, seige tactics, diversions, etc.  Perhaps the Pentagon could use this as a tactical field manual.

It did not take long for Mr. Franzen to change my mind.  This incredible, ambitious work is worth reading for anyone interested in reading about modern American life. It's also worth reading for any fans of literature, for Mr. Franzen is one of the best authors of our generation. He is a national treasure, and this work may well stand to be his masterpiece.

B0033DOIHC|5.0|I am not a reader, I would much rather watch a movie in 2 hrs than spend a week or two reading a book. However, this series was highly recommended to me by a friend of mine who is old enough to be my grandmother. That's right - a book filled with sex, violence, sado-masochistic rape, bibilical references, and mentally flawed characters was recommended to me by a woman in her 70s. The first half of the book has a lot to do with setting up the backgrounds of the characters, and I took a while to read the first half but once it started getting \\"juicy\\" about midway through, I did NOT want to put the book down! I could care less about how well or how poorly it was written, I have no college degree in Literature, but I enjoy a book that keeps me guessing, shifting suspicions from one character to the next, trying to figure out what happened before Mikael and Lisbeth do. I found the murders to the bible verses fascinating, as I am no fan of religion or people that live their lives by the bible, especially when there are verses that promote murder of animals for sacrifice and women for sins. I think this is a great read for any ADULT (stress, this is NOT for teens or children) who wants to be entertained with current, modern characters who are trying to deal with their own pasts who come together to solve a mystery more than 30 years old. I just bought the second book yesterday, ...Played with Fire and can't wait to start it!

There is not a track on it that I find myself singling along to or wanting to hear again.  I'm really not sure why this is their best selling album.  I guess perhaps this time around they aimed for the least common dominator market and when you do that you usually end up with a bland mix of forgettable songs, which is what The Suburbs is to me.

Then, I found the wonderfully hidden disc, which has some of the documentaries I bought this package for, and then I discovered I CAN'T SEE IT!!!!!    I don't mind waiting to see the whole series again, but WHAT THE HELL???? WHY DID THEY PROTECT THAT DISC??????I'm so pissed out I don't think I ever buy in amazon again. $194 and I can't see the best material because nobody took the detail of saying the disc was region encoded.    Thanks a lot, buenavista. Your region protection policy SUCKS.    By the way, the complete collection in Spain has a lot of differences with the USA version, that's why I bought the american one.     So, so pissed off.... :(
0140277447|5.0|This is the most important book I read in 2008 because it introduced me to a topic of which I was ignorant - the Japanese atrocities committed at Nanking in December of 1937.    From a young age I was thankful the Allied forces had defeated the Nazi regime and ended Hitler's reign of terror. I now know the Japanese army at Nanking made the Nazis look humane and am equally thankful the Allied forces prevailed over Japan.    Here is a telling fact from the book: 1 in 25 American POWs perished while under Nazi control. That number was 1 in 3 while under Japanese control.     The book is extremely graphic. Chinese men were buried alive, burned alive, and beheaded. Women were brutally raped. Pregnant women were tortured in unspeakable ways. And yet, many Japanese to this day deny that such events occurred. Some ultra-conservative Japanese have carried out attacks to silence those who disagree.     Those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it. This book is a must read for everyone everywhere.

I LOVED it.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which humanity nearly destroyed itself.  The general public lives in poverty, barely scraping by.  They've been divided into 13 separate districts, each producing one major industries.  Recently, there was an uprising which resulted in the demise of District 13, which was eliminated by the all-powerful Capitol.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a young girl in District 12.  She and her family are barely scraping by by her slightly illegal poaching and selling of wild game to the hungry shopkeepers.  Such activities have made her an excellent shot with her trusty bow and arrow.  Her best friend and hunting partner, Gale, also supports his family in this manner.  Both Katniss and Gale have taken on the burden after the loss of their fathers despite being both under 18 years old.<br /><br />When the annual reaping comes around, both teens are nervous, and for good reason.  Each has their name in the reaping bowl more than most children their age.  Once for each year over 12, and once for each tessarae, emergency food rations,  they have traded for.  Trading for extra entries in the reaping is a dangerous thing, for each year two tributes, a boy and a girl, are picked to go into the arena and participate in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a brutal, vicious fight to the death.  Two tributes from each district are put into a closed off arena and are made to fight to the death.  Out of the 24 children (all entrants must be between 12 and 18) only one may survive.  The entire thing is televised and the families and the general public are made to watch as the children kill each other, are killed by natural events, or die from injuries.

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|WOW!!! I just watched The Water of Mars with my 7 year old daughter, what a fantastic episode, the monster budget they must have to create a T.V. episode must rival a full length Hollywood movie. From the stunning visual quality to the orchestra music. What a terrible shame that David Tennant has left the show, he is truely a great actor, one that can make the viewer feel his emotion and passion.
0385342047|3.0|Don't get me wrong- I love Sophie Kinsella with a passion & when I had the chance to review the latest Shopaholic, I was pretty excited. It's just that well... this book sort of was a big change from what the character of Becky normally was like.<br /><br />If you asked Becky, she'd tell you that her daughter Minnie wasn't spoiled. So what if she's been banned from multiple Santa photo sites & keeps demanding everything she sees? Becky would say that Minnie's just spirited. However when a huge bank goes belly up, Becky is forced to do the unthinkable: no more shopping for clothes. She's devoted herself to this because she's also planning a huge birthday party for Luke, who has never had a proper surprise party before.<br /><br />This book has a lot of what makes a Sophie Kinsella book so much fun, with shopping, misunderstandings, & of course, interesting clothes! While Minnie is a terror for pretty much the entire book, it's still interesting to see how she interacts with others, especially when it comes to Luke's mother Elinore. (Yep, she makes a return in this book!)<br /><br />While this was a fun read & I did enjoy it, I couldn't help but be a little horrified at some of Becky's actions. She's still cute & quirky, but she was far more spoiled & self-serving in this book than she's ever been in any of the previous books. Luckily she isn't like this for the majority of the book, so I was able to overlook it for the most part. It's just that it was pretty jarring at times because she really was pretty selfish & with some of the stuff in the previous books you'd imagine that she's come past that point. (I'm not including her actions towards Minnie in this.) This sort of felt like a rehash of some of the plot elements of previous & the ending sort of sounds like it might be gearing up for more of the same. All of this is still good because Kinsella is a fantastic author, but I've still seen most of this before.<br /><br />I still recommend this book for fans of the series & I did enjoy it more than the previous entry, but this might be better as a library checkout. It's just that the series seems to be winding down & perhaps it might be best for Kinsella to start a new series. There's just not much new to this book, I'm afraid.<br /><br />3.4/5than the previous entry, but this might be better as a library checkout.

B003R0LBVW|2.0|I've generally liked Oprah's other book club choices so decided to take a chance with this. I plugged along through all the insanity until about half way through. I didn't feel like the charactures were real or sympathetic. I hated Walter's rocker roomate and the crazy fan girl. The attraction between Walter's wife and Richard was just not believable. I accidently dropped my kindle on concrete and it was toast. I will not reorder this book because I just don't care how it ends.
044024238X|4.0|I do not normally write reviews, but on completion of this book I was inspired to relay the charm of this novel.    This book explores notions as complex as business espionage, and emotion-based ideas spanning from personal development and achievement, to love. These plot twists are masked by the sweet and charming façade of chick lit.I found the novel to be a light-hearted and humorous escape from reality. I found myself to be immersed in Samantha Sweeting's fictional world, which I find to be quite surprising as my facination usually spans to fantasy novels exclusively.      A great read, a charming heroine.

The only new material was Lisbeth's travels and boob job, only I'm not sure that I like the new and improved Lisbeth.<br />  Will I buy Hornet's Nest?  Not if the rest of \\"Fire\\" doesn't dramatically improve.
B003TXSF5C|3.0|Extremely disappointing. I'm a great fan of Hawking's earlier works, and I thought this Kindle edition would be a fantastic bargain at $9.99 given that the hardcover price was almost four times as much. But the book is incredibly short, among the very shortest on my Kindles (no longer than the shortest novelettes). And 20% of what length there is consists of an index, with another 4% comprising a glossary and acknowledgments; so fully one-quarter of the book is extraneous.<br /><br />If the real content was superb, then all that might not matter so much. But what's left, unfortunately, is treated in an overly simplistic and facile manner. Worst of all, it's marred by an overabundance of incredibly lame, completely unnecessary \\"humor\\", e.g., when talking about interference patterns as seen in ripples in liquids, \\"Other liquids were observed to behave in a similar fashion, except perhaps wine if you've had too much.\\" Or, when explaining how observation of a system affects the outcomes, \\"Can't we, as we do when our supervisor has a spot of mustard on her chin, discreetly watch but not interfere?\\". I'm so glad I didn't shell out the really big bucks for the print edition, and wouldn't consider this book worth more than a couple of dollars, honestly.
0767847431|4.0|THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD is a 105-minute movie.  The movie begins with some fine cinematography, and we see the colorful billowing sails of Sinbad's ship, and men working, from various angles.  As an omen of sorts, we see a close-up of the bowsprit (she becomes alive, later on).  The movie takes place at sea, on land in Arabia, and also in an island location comprising an imaginary melange of Aztec Mexico, England (there is a miniature Stonehenge), and India.  There are a few moments of Indian music (sitars).  The main characters are Captain Sinbad (good) and Prince Koura (evil).  The plot is as follows.  A flying animal drops a gold instrument on Captain Sinbad's ship.  Captain Sinbad brings the gold instrument to one of his friends, who determines that it is part of a metal puzzle.  The goal of the Sinbad then is to find the remaining pieces of the metal puzzle.  In one scene, we see how the fitting together of the pieces of the metal puzzle creates a map, and the map can be used to find an island where there is a fountain of youth.  Overall, the story hangs together fairly well.      SPECIAL EFFECTS.  A flying creature that looks like a purple bat is actually a tiny flying primate. In a lengthy episode occurring on Sinbad's ship, the bowsprit (the wooden lady mounted on the front of the boat) comes alive, and steals Sinbad's paper map.  The sound-effects of the creaking wooden statue, moving about, are amusing.  After stealing the paper map, the lady floats towards Prince Koura's boat, and Prince Koura gets the map.  The wooden lady scene was unexpectedly spectacular, and convincing.  It was like the stone boulders that come alive in GALAXY QUEST, and turn into a walking stone man who goes after actor Tim Allen.  Also, in GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINDBAD is a spectacular scene with a 6-armed goddess.  The 6-armed goddess scene is quite spectacular.  Towards the end of the movie, there is a horse with the head of a cyclops.  Ordinarily, this creature would be considered to be scary and unique and interesting.  But the horse with the cyclops head has a stupid-looking haircut.    Near the beginning of the movie, a girl appears out of thin air, and hovers in the middle of the screen. Then, Captain Sinbad has some bad dreams, which consist of plenty of double-exposures on the movie print. I would not have expected such a cheap special effect, after seeing all of the miracles from the first of the Sinbad films, the spectacular SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD.  Even the most amateur photographer will know that the girl in the air, and the dream sequences, are plain double exposures.      A slave girl (Caroline Munro) is in many scenes.  She serves as a sort of \\"eye candy\\" to prevent male viewers from becoming bored.  Caroline Munro is quite puffy.   But she does not ring true, as she in no way appears Arabic or Persian.  There is no shortage of beautiful Arabic women or Persian woman, and so there is no excuse for choosing Caroline Munro for this movie.  Caroline Munro looks just like Grace Slick, singer with the legendary Jefferson Airplane.  In GOLDEN AGE OF SINBAD, Caroline Munro has hair just like singer Joan Baez.  In other words, she looks like an archetypical mid-1960s hippie chick.  Another actor (Kurt Christian), a young man, plays her counterpart. He is dark-complected, and is more believable for this movie. He also serves as a source of light comedy in this movie.  The handsome gentleman is known for his laziness, but good-naturedness, and his courage develops somewhat during the course of this adventure.  Surprisingly, Caroline Munro and Kurt Christian never interact with each other, even though they are the only characters in this movie in their early 20s.      The Arabic street scenes are colorful, well-populated, and convincing. One of the most excellent, and most convincingly developed parts of this film, is Captain Sinbad's attempts at escaping from a temple, by propelling a rope (connected to a metal rod) out of a chimney hole above.  This was a great scene.  A couple of other parts in this movie do not ring true.  At one cliff hanger, Captain Sinbad is about to get his throat slit by a tribe of green-skinned cave dwellers.  This appears to be a cliff-hanger, but it does not get resolved properly.  The green-skinned people merely get easily distracted by some nearby commotion, and let Captain Sinbad escape.  But most disappointing is an episode near the end of the story, where there is a fountain of water in the cave.  The fountain changes various colors, obviously due to various dyes being put into the water.      The earlier film, SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD is, in my opinion, one of the ten greatest films ever made.  But the later-made film, THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD, is just another movie to add to one's collection.  Here is a warning: the side of the disc that is named the \\"widescreen version\\" of the movie is not a widescreen version.  It is just the full-screen version with 10% of the image chopped off of the top border, and 10% of the image chopped off from the lower border.  I have never encountered a stupider gimmick in my life.  Anyway, the disc contains the same movie on both sides -- the full-frame movie, and the chopped-off movie that is missing 20% of the image.
0307588335|4.0|I agree with another reviewer that this isn't quite at the level of \\"Smartest guys in the room\\" in terms of an explanation of how greed arrogance and \\"a colossal failure of common sense\\" can lead to a financial meltdown.   Still, this is a very good read both in style and in content.    My first book on the subject, \\"Too Big To Fail\\" was very good (recommended) but it begins basically in the 11th hour of the economic meltdown.   Colossal failure, like the actual story, begins years before.    The most dramatic finding of the book is that so many people could see the coming disaster far enough in advance to make a difference.   This book is about the what and why those corrections never happened, at least for Lehman.

B003VQM2M4|4.0|I'm generally a Nick Cave fan in all incarnations (Birthday Party, Bad Seeds, other smaller projects), but I really thought that the first Grinderman album was below par. Actually, as a fan, I felt insulted.     The second Grinderman album is a huge improvement. The production values are higher, the music is better and performed with more skill, and the lyrics actually show some thought. Whatever rawness might be missing (there's nothing quite as quick and dirty as No Pussy Blues on this one) is more than made up for by these improvements. Sure, a few songs are duds, but that's par for the course for any album. Though I still prefer NCTBS, I'm thankful to have this album. I could do without the lame drawings, though.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Before deciding to buy this album, I read some reviews that had already appeared on Amazon.com, paying particular attention to some critical reviews by dedicated blues fans, including one who is also a fan of Cyndi's pop music. Their basic complaint appears to be that Cyndi doesn't have a voice to do the music justice. Certainly, Cyndi makes no attempt to adapt her voice to the music in any way, and why should she? On one level, I agree with them - if what you are looking for is raw, uncompromising blues music, this album doesn`t provide it. I enjoy that kind of music too, but having also read some of the more enthusiastic reviews, I sensed that for me at least, those criticisms don't matter. I knew just from the reviews, without hearing a single note, that I was likely to enjoy this album, and so it proved.<br /><br />This album may lack some of the rough edges that are so characteristic of the music that dedicated blues fans love, but the absence of those rough edges gives the music a different kind of appeal - one that Cyndi's own fans, myself among them, can appreciate. For this album, Cyndi recruited a stellar cast of blues musicians including Allen Toussaint, B B King, Charlie Musselwhite, Ann Peebles and Jonny Lang, ensuring that the music itself is authentic.<br /><br />Though Cyndi often writes her own songs, she did not do so for this album , opting instead to cover a selection of songs that are apparently well known among blues fans and musicians, but which I don't instantly recognize just by playing the album, though it`s very likely that I`ve heard at least some of these songs somewhere before; however, this album is likely to cause me to look for some of the originals in due course. Overall, the album contains a mix of tempos,  beginning with the bouncy Just your fool. The UK edition (which I own) has an extra track not available on the standard US edition, that track being Wild women don't have the blues. I'm assuming it is a cover of the Ida Cox song from 1961, but as the credit for that song is not listed and as I haven't heard the song elsewhere, I can't confirm it.<br /><br />Picking out highlights is tough on an album that features so much great music, but ultimately what you think of the album will depend on what you think of Cyndi Lauper recording a blues album. Personally, I think it's a wonderful album, but I can understand why others might have doubts. We don't all share the same tastes and it would be a dull world if we did.as the credit for that song is not listed and as I haven't heard the song elsewhere, I can't confirm it.

0451228731|5.0|Is this better than Crichton? I'd say Suarez is in the same league, for sure, but doesn't have the track record ... yet.    I'm very picky about fiction books that I read. Most of my reading is non-fiction. For me to pick up a fiction book it has to be at the \\"top rung\\". This book fits that.    Granted, computer types will get into this book more than others. It doesn't get too detailed for non-computer types, though.    This has all the earmarks of being good movie material. Can't wait.

B002RWKSII|5.0|As a Southern California Baby Boomer, I've been listening to Brian Wilson since I was 14 years old. I believe I have every Beach Boys album publicly released and most of Brian's solo efforts. I'm also a big fan of George Gershwin (as a pianist myself I particularly enjoy Rhapsody in Blue). When I came across this new CD by Brian and after reading a few reviews I thought I might enjoy it. I was pleasantly surprised to find out just how much I enjoy it. I've played it every day since. I find this to be a very upbeat, happy album of pleasant melodies and tight vocals. Brian is also to be congratulated for his arrangements as well as his singing. Sure, he doesn't have his \\"1966 voice\\" anymore, but with his maturity I think his voice perfectly fits these songs. The two songs that were unfinished by Gershwin are very strong too. I thought most of this would be in Beach Boys style, there are two like that (\\"I've Got Rhythm\\" and \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\") and I love them for the homage paid to days of old. Another song is done in a kind of 50's \\"Doo Wop\\" style (\\"I've Got a Crush On You\\"). The rest of the selections are more traditional in arrangement yet Brian's influence is definitely to be found on all songs.<br /><br />This is a new direction for Brian Wilson and I'm happy for his return although he hasn't really been away. In a CD of rare releases, The Beach Boys sing \\"Brian's Back\\" a tribute to Brian from Mike Love, I find that song also applies here - Brian is back and I wish him the greatest success with this and future endeavors.
B001Y8WAJ6|5.0|I got into Saxon when I saw the video for \\" Just Me Rock\\" in 1984. I'm not a big fan of Metal per say, though I like some of it, but this album got me in to Saxon big time. Great from beginning to end. What puzzles me is that it's the only Saxon album where the order of the songs differs from the original LP release. I think the songs fit together better in the original order. I'm tempted to rip it and reburn it with the tunes in the original order. I think I paid only $8 or so with postage brand new buying it privately, and considering it's remastered with bonus tracks, it's a great investment!! I'd give it 4 3/4 stars for the change in the song order, but I have to round up. 5 stars all the way!!
B002GZQYMK|3.0|The Resistance is a drastic departure from records like Origin of Symmetry and Absolution. It definitely feels a lot more mainstream than Muse's older work, more like pop music and less like an anti-establishmentarian rock dialogue. There are a couple songs that stand out on the album, like Resistance and MK Ultra, but nothing that really matches Knights of Cydonia and the like.    That said, while it's certainly not Muse's best album, it's also not a bad album. Some songs shine (Resistance), others are weaker though not necessarily bad (Guiding Light). None of them have quite the punch of earlier music. But even as someone who loves Muse's earlier albums, I still enjoy The Resistance. It's better than a lot of the pop crap out there produced by groups that don't have Muse's history and incredible diversity of talent.    I understand why the people who have left painfully harsh 1-star reviews are upset, but don't let those reviews put you off giving this album a shot. Just don't go into it expecting ground-breaking, star-shaking work like Muse has produced previously. The Resistance is aural candy, pure and simple. Not the best thing for you, but certainly all right to indulge in from time to time. A solid three stars, though hoping for a return to more of the 4- and 5-star quality work we've seen from Muse in the past.    (I've also developed a much greater appreciation for some of the songs on this album after seeing them performed live as part of the Resistance Tour 2010. Even if some of the music is more mainstream, unlike many more recently established pop \\"artists,\\" these guys have genuine talent that's all the more evident when it's on a live soundstage. Seeing them in person was absolutely amazing, and gave me a much greater appreciation for just what they can do.)
B0034G4OVS|3.0|I was so excited to see this movie and I couldn't wait to pop it in and watch it tonight. I was expecting a great scary movie and I got an okay, kind-of scary movie that was heavy on the gore. By now you all know the premise...3 college kids get trapped on a chairlift when the ski resort closes for the week. The kids, who were all above-average on the attractive meter, were strong enough actors but there wasn't enough going on to let them really show their talent. The script was slow in places, but the dialogue was seemingly spot on as to how kids talk these days (I work in a high school so I listen to  kids all day.) I liked the wolves, but there was just something missing in the plot. I kept hoping the chairlift operator was going to rear his ugly head and do something sinister, but there were no real characters for me to hate. I think we were supposed to hate the wolves, but they were only doing what hungry wolves do in the dead of winter.    Overall, I enjoyed this movie but I don't think I would watch it again. If there had been more suspense or a true villain for me to loathe I might have felt stronger about FROZEN. As it stands I will probably never think about it again after I hit \\"Publish review.\\"
0439023513|5.0|I was looking forward to the release of this book for a year. I wasn't disappointed. Suzanne Collins has a way of capturing an essence of addictive literature. Once you start reading this book you won't be able to put it down. I was enthralled with the story line and following the characters in the midst of tragedy and hardships. The thing I liked most about this book was Katniss and her psychological issues. It was really interesting to me to see what she was going through and seeing through her eyes what it is like to deal with serious issues. I think all people that read this book will be able to compare themselves to Katniss and use her growing experiences to work through problems in their own lives. The ending was a little disappointing. Personally, not everyone can get what they want though. Putting aside prejudices, the book was excellent all over. Certain twists will keep you guessing. New developments will keep you interested. And the resolution will definitely surprise you. This book is worth calling a favorite.
0385737955|2.0|After completing the Hunger Games trilogy, I was eager for another great YA dystopian read but did not find it in The Maze Runner. I was initially intrigued by the book's description. I knew there would be boys caught in a maze, with their memories wiped and little hope for escape, and I knew that the appearance of a girl on the scene would change everything. Mazes, games, riddles, and other sorts of non-traditional mysteries attract me, but Dashner's execution of his book did not.<br /><br />The plot was ill-paced. At times it felt slow, because Dashner introduced the reader to the maze in the same way the main character, Thomas, was introduced to it: both the reader and Thomas learn almost everything through numerous secondary explanations by characters. In more skilled hands, this might be an effective way of immersing a reader in a fictional world. Dashner's exposition, however, felt cumbersome. As a reader, if I'm going to be told about a world rather than shown it, I'd better be told well. When I wasn't slogging through Dashner's writing, I was tumbling head-over-heels down its textual cliffs. Parts of the novel simply moved too quickly for any real character or plot development to occur. Readers are barely introduced to the main protagonist before being introduced to Teresa, the girl who supposedly changes everything. We really have very little sense for what's changing, because this inciting action comes so shortly after our encounter with Thomas.<br /><br />The plot also felt as if it had been constructed with little forethought. Each step or twist in the plot seemed as if it were generated on the spot as the author wrote his way linearly through this novel. Shazam! Such and such happens out of the blue. A quick patch-up of missing explanation ensues. Shazam! The next twist happens, followed by some explanation. And so on, until one of the biggest Shazams!: The crew exits the maze and suddenly, for no apparent reason, one of their members is killed. Subtlebuild-up of suspense and intricately interwoven plots do not exist in this novel. It's almost entirely composed of sudden action followed by explanatory reaction.<br /><br />All this might not matter so much, if I'd felt in any way connected to the characters. But I didn't. Most of the boys meshed together in my brain, particularly since so many of them end up acting \\"out of character\\" anyway. As for Teresa and Thomas, readers know little about their back-story (until the peritextual \\"Exclusive Wicked Correspondence\\" at the end), and I didn't find their characters all that complex, deep, relatable, or quirky (aside from their obvious telepathic skill). Character \\"complexity\\" in this novel was little more than character \\"unpredictability.\\"<br /><br />In short, I was disappointed. The reason I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1, though, is because I did at least finish it. I've no intention of reading the sequel, however.

The author does a great job engaging the reader with humor and his personal experiences. Also, goes into great detail about different concepts that you'd learn about in a Biology course. Highly recommended, even if you're not a Biology major.

B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Being the third in the series of Tinker Bell movies, you'd think the story would be getting stale. This edition, had a sentimental touch to it that was wonderful. It felt like a mix of classic \\"Peter Pan\\" with the live-action movie \\"Fairy Tale\\".<br /><br />We're looking forward to the last season in this Series, Winter.

0765326353|4.0|I'm afraid that I'll need to write a shorter review than I feel this book is worthy of due to a broken computer and the horrible-ness of writing on an iPhone.     I loved this book, it felt like just the right length, which is rare for such a massive novel- it also managed to hold my attention nearly the entire time, also a rare feat due to my constant need for useless external stimuli. (I blame practically growing up with the Internet.)     The characters were all well thought out and interesting. Occasionally in a multi-character novel I will skip chapters devoted to certain characters in order to get back into reading about the ones that I personally find interesting to read about, that never happened with the way of kings.     I could go on, but it would only be more praise. I just hope the next book comes soon. If you enjoy fantasy, or Brandon Sanderson's other works you should definitely give this a shot. (You also must be willing to get involved in what could likely become a very long series of massive books.)
0553582038|1.0|I was a soldier in Iraq when this book was released.  I had been eagerly waiting for 4 years for a new installment of what I felt at the time was the best and brightest light in the fantasy sub-genre.  I was disappointed.  By now you know that every major character that GRRM had cultivated for nearly 3000 pages, 10 years and 3 novels was absent or only mentioned peripherally at best.  But that's not the biggest betrayal of this novel.  The biggest betrayal is the introduction of new POVs that we, as readers, have nothing invested in.  We couldn't care less about them and aren't given any compelling reasons to begin caring.  Brienne, Samwell, the Greyjoys, and anything happening in Dorne were minor ornamentations to the first three novels -- and that's being generous in some cases.  In this one, they are center-stage for a solid 2/3rds of the text and they contribute nothing.  NOTHING.  They don't advance the plot, they don't illuminate motivations of the major players, they don't even bother to capture your interest.  Brienne LITERALLY rides around and looks for someone the whole book.  That's it.  I just summed up in eleven words what evidently takes a dozen or so entire chapters for GRRM to convey.    For a fan of the world of ASOIAF, this is an \\"okay\\" novel.  It provides depth of background and expands the tapestry of this world, letting you into the minds of characters that, prior to this novel, you had no access to.  For fans of the STORY of ASOIAF, this book is a virtual waste of time.  There are perhaps half a dozen chapters that advance the story and, after all, I believe thats what most of us are craving.  As I type this, we've been waiting almost 5 years for the next installment, A Dance with Dragons.  I won't bore you with reasons why I'm irritated about it.  (At this point, you're either a GRRM apologist and have forgiven him for making you wait almost a decade for something new to happen in his creation, or you're not.  I am not.)  However, to say thatI've moved on to other stories and writers is an understatement.      If you're new to ASOIAF, I'm advising you to avoid these novels.  I have a feeling GRRM will end up breaking our hearts.  He is notorious for not keeping notes and \\"writing from his mind\\".  So unlike Jordan, who had extensive outlines, notes and ideas for a future ghostwriter to work from in the event of his untimely death, GRRM may leave nothing but an unfinished series.      At the very least, you can probably skip this novel.  What \\"A New Spring\\" was to the Wheel of Time series, this book will be to ASOIAF.  An interesting side-journey for hardcore fans, but, to the casual reader, ultimately a marketing diversion intended to soak you of more money.
B001TK80C0|1.0|this film movie series jumped the dolphin a long time ago and then just threw in a woman terminator to make it all better again. ha? for a start the woman terminator could just have pretended to Arnold that she loved him. they could then have gone back in time together to caveman times or at least the middle ages and had a robot family which would then have ruled the world easy by the time john connor was supossed to be born. yet we're supossed not to even notice that. pathetic.

0739341774|4.0|I actually liked this audio version.  It was very well narrated.  Very detailed in its description of life in Pompeii during the time.  I wish the author would have concentrated more on the actual volcano eruption rather than on the problem encountered with the aquaduct but then I realize that the aquaduct was his main theme for the book.  Also, I wish there would have been more details regarding the characters.  The female character was hardly explored  and also her connection to the main character.  Overall, I did enjoy the novel very much...
0553062182|5.0|This book is well worth the read. Currently I am up to chapter 5, devouring it as a piece of rich dark chocolate. Unfolding the shinny gold wrapper, taking a small nibble, swilling the bitter sweet decadent flavour around my mouth, then reluctantly swallowing. I would recommend it to those out there that think they might be highly sensitive, or know of someone in their life that could fit the bill. It is less self help book, but rather self esteem building. A reorganisation of how you think about yourself, your memories, history, and where you place yourself in the world around you.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I recently purchased a Kindle and found that in many cases the prices for very old collections are either very inexpensive or free. The more recent versions of books are generally priced in acceptable levels. BUT Kindle version of Fall of Giants for 19.99 is outrageous and I cannot justify the purchase since I can get the hard cover for less even in overprice european store. Fiction books for Kindle should always be in the 9.99 range maximum. More for comprehensive non-fiction such as science and medical books. Get the price down.

0385342047|4.0|I've been a Shopaholic Series fan since the first book came out.  I loved her latest installment, but I do have one gripe:          *************************************************SPOILERS*********************************************************      On one page, Google Chrome, Translate, Voice and Wave were all mentioned as part of a suggested web search when Becky was searching for something. The story takes place between 2005-2006.  None of those Google titles were invented yet, or if they were, they were in the very basic stages of development.  I do wish Sophie had done her research a little more.  That's why I gave only 4 stars.    Other then that, the book was funny, light and had a couple of surprises.  Becky, of course, gets herself in situations she can't seem to get out of and needs help.  Her mothering is both unbelievable and believable as so many people are in the \\"entitlement\\" stage these days.  I loved the little dig at rich, SAH mom's who go crazy over selecting a preschool for their toddler.  The ending was left wide open for another Shopaholic book.    I recommend this if you're a fan of Becky Bloomwood, love to shop and question your own mothering skills!  It's a light read perfect for a Sunday afternoon.
0061714372|5.0|Megadeth has long been my favorite heavy metal band which logically means that Dave Mustaine must be my favorite metal frontman. Reading his autobiography was more of a challenge than I had anticipated because of the darkness he experienced throughout his life. It's a depressing read but it's stark reality, no holds barred. There is redemption and if you're a fan of Dave and Megadeth, Mustaine is a must read.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|After I saw the price for Fall of Giants on Kindle  I went to Amazon.com and. bought it for $3.75 plus $3.99 S&H. Now I will share it with 4 friends thereby we effectively split the total cost of $7.74 to $1.54 per person.  Kindle, continue with this marketing plan and watch the bottom line shrink as readers out smart you with their dollars.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|Whatever else is in the movie, THIS IS A LOVE STORY. Anyone who doesn't realize that has missed the entire point. A man living in turbulent times and circumstances, afflicted with a difficult handicap, goes to extraordinary lengths for the woman he cannot stop loving. All the rest is background, albeit entertaining background.     While I found the different point of view (that of Muslims and Hindus in America) interesting and enlightening, no one should take the political and/or social aspects of this movie seriously other than to view them as educational. It's simply part of the setting. That's why no one attempted to DO them very seriously...because they were background to the plot, they were not the plot itself. This is not a failed front for a social/political documentary. It's an extraordinarily successful, beautiful, and sensitive love story.    Ironically, though the movie is about Muslims and Hindus and not a mention is made of the Christian religion in the entire film (other than to show a couple of non-religious scenes in a church), there is a powerful Christian message (probably common to most religions): that love heals and hatred destroys, and that character and moral courage (not bravado) are what make real men.      It's sad that no one has thought to praise the remarkable performance of Shahrukh Khan, who portrays a man afflicted with Aspberger's Syndrome, a high-functioning form of autism. Khan is at a disadvantage: Had Dustin Hoffman never done Rainman, nor Leonardo DiCaprio given us his amazing performance in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Khan's portrayal of Risvan Khan might have been given the considerable respect it deserves. As it is, in my view he still excels the others in one respect: he manages to infuse charm, high intelligence, and even sexiness into his very convincing portrayal of a disability generally not thought of as very sexy.      The charm and comedy of this movie are irresistible. The chemistry between the leading actors is legendary in India (they've made at least 5 movies together). The directing is flawless, the acting top-rate, the photography excellent, the music lively and compelling. One note about the music: it's ethnic (hence Indian), which means it's not what American audiences are used to hearing. But if you can get past the culture shock, you may do as I did and end up loving it enough to buy the CD.     There is enough action to keep even my husband, who loves nothing more than to see buildings blowing up, interested. When asked if there are very many subtitles to read, I told my daughter there were some, but not enough to distract from the movie. Only when I watched it a second time did I realize there are subtitles throughout most of it (I was too absorbed to even realize I was reading subtitles most of the time. Hint: use the Pause button as needed). I was riveted throughout the entire movie and never found a single moment boring. In fact, I was surprised at how fast the time had gone. And when the movie was over, even my action-loving husband said, \\"I'm not sure, but that may be the best movie I've ever seen.\\"     For parents: This movie does not contain nudity, sex scenes (although the word \\"sex\\" is mentioned), nor does it contain anything crude. There is some violence, but it's not pervasive, nor is it graphic. And here's a wonderfully refreshing twist: the couple actually marries before sleeping together! My husband did think he heard the F word in one scene, but I've watched the movie twice and didn't hear it; so if it's in there, it's not obvious.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The G930's are about the best you can get when it comes to PC gaming headsets. Not only are they wireless, but they sound great too. Highs are high, and the lows are full and tight. The 7.1 surround is true to the name. This headset takes full advantage of all Dolby TrueHD audio channels and doesn't miss a beat, even in the most audibly cluttered movie scenes. I could not be more please with their performance. I'm using this headset in an office building, completely saturated with 2.4Ghz wifi signals. I could easily travel 40 - 50 ft away from the receiver (through about 4 - 6 walls) before I lost my signal, without any artifacts or distortion. In a household setting, your range will vary because of different wall materials, as well as insulation; but you should still be able to receive signal within a range of 30 to 40 feet.  I didn't really use the voice modulation that much (except to prank my boss into thinking the VOIP systems were malfunctioning), so I can't really comment on their effectiveness or clarity, but they seem to be ok.          Only problem I had was with the macro buttons not being able to be fully customized. Due to it's relatively new nature, it seems that Logitech has limited the number of usable features incorporated into the macro sets. Regardless, I would recommend this headset to anybody who wants a truly exceptional sounding set of headphones.            On a side not: Worked well at work for about 12 hours on a Friday, then I left them sit for the weekend. Came back into work on Monday and they barely worked. Audio was going in and out, and eventually they stopped pairing to the usb wireless key(included in the package) altogether. I knew external foul play was not an excuse because I have a locked office, so I suspected a driver issue. After reinstalling the drivers a few times, no dice. Tried them on two other computers in the office, still no dice. Contacted Amazon, they had a replacement in the mail within a half an hour. I'm sure that it was just a defective piece. Eagerly awaiting the next headset's arrival tomorrow.     Even with the hardware failure issue, I would still recommend this headset to anyone. A products reputation should not be tarnished just because there was a defect or two in the bunch.

0439023513|4.0|I adore Suzanne Collins' writing style and imagination. The Hunger Games series is one of the most memorable and haunting series I've read (and I've read many) in the young adult fantasy genre.  She consistently draws me into this futuristic world where a teenage girl Katniss is the hero of a brutal gladiator-like kill-to-the-death televised game. For this little moment of escapism, I thank her.  Having read the previous two books in this trilogy, I expected an ending that will bring closure to this trilogy. Instead, it left me frustrated, depressed, and sad. My hopes for a happy ending is shattered along with the characters' hopes for a future. I don't know if I had too high of an expectation, but I wanted a different ending. Nevertheless, I was drawn into Katniss' story. Like it or not, Collins achieved her purpose by drawing me in and getting me so involved in this fantastic world that I personally felt disappointed and depressed by the war and deaths. That is good, if not great writing, and she elicited a strong emotional response from me after all.

B002RSDW8A|5.0|I love the movie JULIE & JULIA and the BLURAY edition has some great extras.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie, \\"JULIE & JULIA\\" is based on the book [[ASIN:031604251X Julie and Julia: My Year of Cooking Dangerously]] about writer Julie Powell's blog about cooking 524 of Julia Child's recipes from the book, [[ASIN:0375413405 Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. 1]], in one year. It also goes back in time and shows what was going on in Child's life and how the book came about. But the movie is so much more than a cook-a-thon and bio-pic. It also deals with how people can transform their lives by following their passion, even when everyone else says you can't do it. The film also shows the love that people can have for one another and how eating is so much more than just satisfying hunger; it brings people together.<br /><br />The movie is funny, has dramatic moments, and the cast is outstanding!

1161449159|3.0|I've just finished reading \\"Pollyanna Grows Up,\\" first published in 1915---the follow-up to the wildly popular \\"Pollyanna,\\" which I had reviewed recently.<br /><br />No surprise, Pollyanna is back to work her magic once again in this story. Author Eleanor Porter wisely shifts the location of the first half of the book from small-town Vermont to Boston---a change of scene which allows the heroine to ply her charms on an entirely new set of characters. And from the get-go, the story proceeds pretty much as one would expect. That isn't to say it's dull reading---on the contrary, this story totally got to me emotionally----I seem to be a push-over for the sentimental sort of novels that were popular during this time period! However, once again the chief drawback of the novel is the character of Pollyanna herself; she's much, much too innocently sweet to be the tiniest bit believable as a real-life child. Again, she isn't sugary-sweet in a disgusting Elsie Dinsmore fashion, but some realism to the character would have been refreshing and most welcome.<br /><br />It seems so unkind of me, but I keep thinking that this character appears for all intents and purposes to be mentally challenged, always acting and speaking like she's about half of her supposed age. This tendency fortunately diminishes during the second half of the novel, which takes Pollyanna from the age of 13 to age 20, but unfortunately she doesn't become any more interesting. The tale ends by successfully wrapping up three separate romances, including Pollyanna's own---and it doesn't take a genius to figure out who she ends up with!<br /><br />And with this novel the author concluded the Pollyanna story. However, after Eleanor Porter's death in 1920 the publisher was only too happy to continue the Pollyanna series with an additional eleven novels. Now, I've been rather dismissive of these sequels in the past, dimly remembering them as being very typical, cookie-cutter series books practically indistinguishable to most other girls' series of the time period. However, after a re-read of the original two Pollyanna stories I can't help but wonder if a grown-up Pollyanna, as written by a different author, might not actually be an enjoyable improvement over the original child character. I have six of the sequels at hand, so at some point I'm going to give them a try to see what I think. I have almost no recollection whatsoever of any of the sequels, from my childhood reading.<br /><br />I have to say, bits of this story really got to me even as I recognised its shortcomings, and I'll still give it a recommendation to those who are seriously interested in vintage children's literature, are nostalgia buffs---or those who aren't as sarcastic as I usually am. Heh.  But honestly----no, I'm not wildly enthusiastic about this book.<br /><br />My copy (second impression April 1915) is a match to my copy of the first book; it contains eight tipped-in full page black-and-white paintings for the illustrations---very nicely done. And the cover is of the same attractive fabric as that used on the first book (though in this case it's a light blue instead of green)---I've seen one bookseller refer to the boards as being covered in watered silk.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Suzanne Collins wields an axe in the final piece of The Hunger Games trilogy, it's a big unforgiving axe and she sure knows how to use it.    Mockingjay zips along with the same furious pace that the previous books did. There's an awful lot of loose ends to tie up and Collins does a good job of finishing up her story with no stone left unturned.    Some will love the direction she takes with Mockingjay and I feel like others will be massively disappointed, Collins is ruthless with the characters and all the way through this final installment it's utter carnage and destruction. If the message she wanted to deliver is that war is a bloody and awful thing, she hit it out of the park with her writing.    Mockingjay is not for the faint hearted, although let's be honest, neither were the first two novels of the series so perhaps there shouldn't be too many surprised readers when all is said and done.    Personally I enjoyed Mockingjay alot and found it a very fitting end. A couple of the deaths in this book hit home and that's when you know an author has done a good job with her characters, when you actually care what happens to them.    If I have a couple of issues with the book I'd say a couple of deaths were unnecessary, I won't say which so as not to spoil it for future readers, but I felt like some of the cause and effect could have been done differently without killing off one or two characters.    Also, I really enjoyed the hunger games idea and over the three books I would have liked to have read more about that. As it turns out the Hunger Games are mostly a mechanism for Collins to write of a rebellion and largely a war story at the end of the day.    Overall, Mocking jay is a good ending to a good trilogy that some will love and a few might hate, but the fact that you might hate it because you are invested in the story and would wish for something different should tell you that Collins did a great job with her novels.

Yes, you can make analogies to our times and war, but to be honest, I just liked the story line and looked forward to another adventure.  Suzanne... please write more of this series!

Luther Dickinson on all these \\"old\\" Crowe tunes....perfection. Chris sounds great and the band bleeds heart and soul in every note. A must have.Best Album in 2010 in my opinion!
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|I love Resident evil and purchased this since my old copy had stopped working. I figured I would buy the deluxe instead of just the normal DVD but I must say there is honestly no difference what so ever and I would suggest just buying the normal DVD instead of the deluxe. But it did arrive very quickly and well packaged. I was just disappointed that the deluxe did not really have anything different or extra then just the regular copy.
1400064287|5.0|This book tries to figure out exactly what the title says, why some ideas survive and others die. The author presents some ideas on how to make your ideas stickier, such as violating schemas, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating \\"curiosity gaps.\\" It gives you a different way to communicate ideas. This book is great for marketers and business executives because it goes over the challenges we face while trying to make ideas \\"stick\\". Some ideas presented can get a little \\"wordy\\" and the authors use a lot of examples to drive the point home, this had me skimming over some pages to get to the next idea.     This book is fun to read, I really liked the examples that they used it made the chapters go quickly. As with any book your read you are not going to agree with all their ideas, but everyone will be able to take something away when they are done reading. I recommend this book to college/graduate students, marketers, business executives, or just someone who likes to read.  Also, for anyone that has tried to present their ideas, either to a client or the board of directors at their firm, there are some great ideas in this book to get your point across.     The insight on these topics are useful and many say they wished they read it earlier. If you like the writing style of the authors you will also like Malcom Gladwell's books. Also, if you haven't read the Freakonomics books I would read them too. The authors point out six main points that need to be done in order to have your ideas stick, each idea has it's own chapter that gives examples and guidelines. (This was mentioned in several other previous reviews)    1.    Simplicity   2. Unexpectedness   3. Concreteness   4. Credibility   5. Emotions   6. Stories       This book is good for marketers, business owners, MBA students and people that are interested in how to make their ideas \\"stick\\".
B003UYUQZW|4.0|This film has a nice smooth feel to it. It packs the goods of what makes a good movie: A dynamic hero, a pretty girl in distress and a tricky villain. From the start, this movie rolls out the stunts. It is a fast paced movie, but still takes the time to allow for some romance to build.<br /><br />The storyline is not easy to predict, this is a definite plus in my opinion. So often these days you are able to predict the plot of a movie. This one keeps you guessing until closer to the end. I really like the chemistry that is generated between Dashan and Tamina as they out-smart one another in order to hold onto that special dagger.<br /><br />There are also a lot of adventure elements contained within this movie that just puts it on a grand scale as it covers a massive sea of sand. My only qualm with this movie is that I wished they was more moments when the Sands of Time were actually used.
B002BB702M|1.0|The technical details of this blu ray state that this is the 155 minute extended version of this film.  I waited over 2 weeks to finally get and turned if over to look at the back of the case where it says: 118 minutes running time.  $52 for the regular version? I don't think so.  Returned it.  I'll continue my search for the longer version on Blu Ray.<br /><br />-Karl
B0000027G6|5.0|This cd has very soothing music. I love to listen to it at home when my home is quiet, in my room where I can lay back and relax without interuption. This sound track is the orginal music from one of my favorite movies. As you listen to it you can place yourself on the new frontier, riding along facing the joys as well as the dangers of the frontier. I would recommend this to all people who enjoy a quiet time in their busy lives, this one produces that moment.
B003V5PPZG|1.0|basically theys old out with this album, no more hungry linkin park who sang songs for their fans,now its all about keeping the record company happy, thats what happens folks when people become rich they forget where they came from. treasure the old park, now its  just a bunch of useless screaming, and there is a bunch of wasted space with no songs except beats? someone needs to tell the rich linkin park band this old fan wants his money back, what a waste of money for this garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|It seems to me that Eric had a great time assembling this collection of songs and musicians. The title is appropriate because this album gives us a snap shot of who the man is musically at this moment. \\"Clapton\\" is kind of cross between Unplugged and Back to the Cradle. I gave it 5* relative to the to other music out there but within EC's body of work it rates a 2.5*. Buy this album if you love EC and want something new or just to take a look at what he's up to. For the casual fan buy a classic (Layla, Slowhand, etc) you don't own or check out Sessions for Robert J a CD/DVD set that I love.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|The Dark Knight LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY, Was the best movie of the Batman series (5 out of 5) But the this packaging can be misleading, when its described as The Dark Knight LIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY Two-Disc Special Edition with Exclusive Batman Mask Packaging & and pictures makes the mask look alot bigger & life like size, then when u get it, its the size of your hand (3 out of 5) for packaging.
0525951652|5.0|I read The Pillars of The Earth and World Without End and have recommended them to everyone I know. And when I heard that Ken Follett was writing another Triology I just had to jump on it. I preordered this and got it right on time. I am very pleased with the speedy delivery and can't put this book down!! Please read it. Please read the others if you haven't. Ken Follett has an imagination and an attention to detail like no other. It's impossible to read his books and not feel like you're right there experiencing it.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I love this show and will rewatch it over and over again once I get discs that will play.  There are obvious flaws on the surface of several of the discs, leading to freezing, skipping, etc.  Disc 3 would not play at all in my player.  If you buy this title, watch all the DVDs before the return window closes.      Amazon is vey good about taking returns within 30 days.  So if you get a bum copy, send it back, don't just fume over it.  Maybe if the manufacturers get enough returns, they'll pay better attention.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Got the three disc set pre-ordered from Amazon 1 day early. It came shrink wrapped and in fantastic condition (there was concern about purchasing from other retailers who were selling counterfeit products, that is why I ordered it with fulfillment by Amazon). Got it at a great price, works great, couldn't be happier.  Picture quality is fantastic on DVD, now I just need a Blu-ray player!
0811876373|5.0|This book is all and more then I expected!  Easy to follow instruction, Great pictures!  Couldn't wait for the book to come to market, and I am not disappointed.  Everyone should buy it!  I have enjoyed bakerella's website and I am enjoying her book!
B002H3T3TM|5.0|I was informed that the item I ordered would take one month to two months to be delivered since I live outside the US and in actual fact it took two and half weeks to be delivered.  So I'm very excited about that.  Thank you!!
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|I can't believe it took Jerry Seinfeld so many years to come up with such a mediocre effort in Bee Movie. It's ironic that Jerry would mention in his act that \\"the movies you see nowadays kinda suck\\" and here he makes a movie that falls short of actually being anywhere near good. Mmmm....    Bee Movie is an okay animated picture, but for someone with Jerry's talents I expected so much better. The animation is average, nothing special, but it will keep your kids entertained. Definitely a keeper for the kids, but for adults I recommend you see this once and move on.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Wonderful record...it lives and breathes in a way that only solid and inspired songwriting and musicianship can accomplish . And, although walking that continually difficult fine line between maximizing every aural micro moment of a project in order to attain the loudest possible CD in a collection, and leaving some semblance of actual dynamic range, the engineers involved opted for something that successfully looks and sounds commercially viable but still actually allows the project to not be a ceaseless and taxingly rude assault on every part of the human hearing mechanism; in short, they have managed to be competitive and 'musical'...what a concept ! And I have managed to write the days best candidate for 'run-on sentence of the month'.     In any case, in a crossover market overcrowded with confused projects trying to be diametrically opposed things at once, this record achieves the lofty goal in a most noble way ...performance-wise, compositionally and technically- and all with a committed, musical and clear sense of the most important part...the music.     What a nice and much needed breath of fresh air. Thank you 'Lady Antebellum' and all involved.  Looking forward to hearing/experiencing more ...

B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is truly one of the best fantasy TV series around.  I am a big fan of the genre.  This is probably one of the only TV series that my wife and I enjoy watching together she is more of a reality show person, not the stupid drunk naked guy and gal ones, but the ones like dancing with the stars.  Anyways enough about her.  This series has a lot that you could hope for, lots of fighting, magic, villains, magical items.  I first caught it on hulu and was so interested in it I watched the whole first season within a matter of days.  Then I watched it over again when it restarted on TV with my wife she got just as hooked as I was.  Sure it may not follow the book but most tv/movies don't.  You have to get past that if your a lover of the book great, but nothing is ever as good as you would imagine it to be.  Be thankful that the book you love has been put in a visual version.  All in all a great series and one you can and should share with your loved ones.  We also liked sparticus but since this and sparticus have been discontinued we are down to merlin which is nowhere near as good as the other two, Seeker is/was our top favorite Merlin is just there so we don't hurt as much.
B003EYVXYG|4.0|The bad reviews given unfairly to this film are a result of impossibly high expectations. As this is a \\"sequel\\" to the living dead series, fans are quick to compare it to the predecessors.  In doing so, of course you'll be upset. Romero will never top \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" or \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". Don't expect him to. As a veteran Romero fan, I cringe at the reviews for this decade's living dead films. I read a review somewhere that claimed something like: Diary of the Dead sucked but at least it was better than Land of the Dead. What? \\"Land\\" was frightening, full of action, mild humor, complete with the expected social message, and well-crafted characters--just like \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\" Yet people bash it. \\"Romero's using CGI now.  Wah!\\" A city fortified years after the zombie holocaust? But don't use CGI, Romero; make films like you're still in the seventies. Sure. \\"Diary of the Dead\\" is another victim of poor reviews. Because of the use of subjective camera like in \\"The Blair Witch Project\\"? Big deal. Pay attention to the good horror scenes: the opening news footage, the zombie dragging his IV drip as he attacks, the lead actress's return home to find her family undead, Romero's own homage to the \\"Dawn\\" tenement scene, and the man drying his hair tackled into the bathtub by a zombie. To prove I'm not sold on a film simply because Romero directed it(\\"Season of the Witch\\" and \\"There's Always Vanilla\\" belong in the toilet), I'll admit that I wasn't keen on \\"Survival\\" at first. Too much comedy-often borderline silliness-and ridiculous Irish accents(a descendent of Irishmen born in America will not have an Irish accent). Even after my third viewing, these cons remain. But I realized my error: This is a good film. If you do compare \\"Survival\\" to predecessors, how do you not find good in this one? The scene with the zombie children is amazing; it could've been in \\"Dawn\\". As could the zombie driving the car. The zombies in the bay reflected \\"Land\\". Romero returned to overt gore that \\"Diary\\" lacked (and not all CGI-though I do miss Tom Savini). One minor complaint is on commentary: One producer said that Romero brought up new themes such as how loved ones deal with family member zombies and the debate with whether or not they should be kept 'alive'.  Hello, did he not see \\"Dawn\\"? A few minutes into \\"Dawn\\" the anchorman and the doctor argued about handling the pandemic \\"without emotion.\\" Not long after that SWAT and Guardsmen raided an apartment where families refused to kill dead relatives(the cellar scene, oh yeah); Peter awaited Roger's resurrection in a terrifying, dramatic scene; and in a devastating scene Peter awaits Flyboy's return, post-mortem, so he can kill him, relieve his good friend of a 'life' as the walking dead. New theme, producer? Not at all. This allusion to \\"Dawn\\" should be enough to entice Romero fans to \\"Survival\\". Overall, this is the worst of the living dead series, but for me that's like saying the worst ice cream. Show Romero appreciation by purchasing this DVD . . . and watch it more than once.

B003VMIGM8|3.0|This movie is completely messed up.  Spoiler alert for those that haven't seen it.. I am speechless!  Overall I guess it was an alright movie, nothing brilliant but nothing dull either.  The intensity of Chloe's character and what she makes Julianne Moore do and go through is ridiculous.  Turns out (I think) that everything Chloe told Julianne's character was a lie, to ultimately ruin her life and potentially have what she had.    I wouldn't say don't watch the movie, but it definitely was one I probably won't watch again.
B000000HXK|5.0|from \\"The Loom\\" to \\"Pendulum Man\\"...the textures, the instrumentation it just floors you, it honestly thrusts you into a atmosphere which reminds you of a rainy urban day to a cool night outdoors; well that's what I felt anyway.<br />play it loud, be quiet, turn off the lights with your brain on,<br />that's my best advice to anyone who buys this album.<br />Pendulum Man in my opinion is one the greatest songs to ever come from the Post-Rock genre.
B003YOZNBU|1.0|How studio made such a lousy movie .its disappointingly shameful.No one is really acting with heart .Josh Brolin is good actor but i think he wanted to be part of a superhero movie .He tried to bring some emotion to movie but there was nothing in script that could go his way.John Malkovich proved Worst villain choice in history of Comics movies.Not for  a single shot it felt that he is interested in role and trying to portray it.There is non sense random killing in name of pain by every character .<br /><br />Megan fox looked great and acted well too but her role is hardly 10 minute in whole movie .<br /><br />PG13 Are you Kidding me :<br /><br />Guy who can talk to  dead<br />Himself is undead with spirits closed in his body<br />Disfigured face<br />Prostitute<br /><br />As all the elements of R rated movie are there that could mark towards some business but they chose to make it PG13 what they been thinking its Ram sammi behind the camera ?<br /><br />Finally movie wins award for bad acting,bad story, bad direction ,Worst western and off course bad box office and home sales.
B003ZK50SY|1.0|I've heard and enjoyed David Sedaris's essays as read on This American Life, so I picked up this book at an airport hoping it would keep me entertained on a long flight.  I don't know if it's a difference in quality between the essays I've heard and those in this book, or the difference between the spoken and written media, but I found this book to be unbearably cloying, tedious and whiny.  I understood all the jokes, but they fell flat.  Sorry - I really wanted to like this book, but I was so bored with it that I had to put it down halfway through.

0545123283|5.0|The love story between Grace and Sam continues in this sequel to Stiefvater's SHIVER.<br /><br />With new points of view from Isabel and a new character, Cole, LINGER is full of new complications and unexpected dangers.<br /><br />With their future uncertain, Grace and Sam struggle to find a way to stay together. The new trouble brought by Cole isn't helping.  To top it all off, something is terribly wrong with Grace. There's only one way to save her, but will Sam be strong enough to do it?<br /><br />It's hard to write a review of this book without giving too much away. I adored SHIVER and didn't think I'd like LINGER as much. Happily, I was wrong. I love the new addition of Cole's character and the complications and situations he brings to the story. This story will LINGER in my mind as I wait for FOREVER.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Joan Stradling

0439023513|5.0|It's over.  The trilogy is finished.  There will now need to be a new series that will have people waiting impatiently from year to year for the next installment.  *Sigh*<br /><br />MOCKINGJAY begins with Katniss shuffling through the ashy remains of District 12.  Having survived her second Hunger Games, she has recovered enough from her injuries to visit the little that is left of her former home.  Her concussion-ravaged brain is still trying to make sense of all that has happened.<br /><br />When she is returned to the safety of District 13, Katniss must be gradually reintroduced to those from District 12 who survived, and she must find her place in her new surroundings.  Her mother and Prim are busy every day caring for patients in the hospital, and Gale continues his recovery and slowly begins to work for the rebel cause in District 13.  Katniss fills her days ignoring her district required schedule as she wanders from one isolated hiding place to the next.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for 13's leaders to make it clear that they plan to be the ones to lead the rebels to victory against the Capitol and President Snow.  Katniss is once more expected to be the symbol for that victory.  She knows their goal is to make her the Mockingjay, but she hesitates to step forward immediately.  Does she want the responsibility?  Is she ready for what will most likely be her final living act?<br /><br />When Katniss finally accepts the role of Mockingjay, she does so with stipulations, two of which are that Peeta and the other Hunger Games survivors must be rescued and she must be the one to end the life of President Snow.  Her demands are met and the preparations begin.  What follows is non-stop action filled with violence, torture, attacks, and destruction.<br /><br />After reading THE HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE, I should have guessed that author Suzanne Collins would not make things easy for Katniss and her friends.  She filled this last book with twists and turns as well as her usual direct, \\"in your face\\" moments that had me gasping through the first two books.  Without including any spoilers, I'll say I found the ending acceptable and on-course with what I expected from both Collins and her characters.  This is definitely a series that will be enjoyed by readers for years to come.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Sally Kruger, aka \\"Readingjunky\\"e\\" moments that had me gasping through the first two books.

B001KTRFRG|5.0|One of the best action movies ever, available for the PSP.  Enjoy the epic struggle of Batman vs. Joker in Christopher Nolan's vision of The Dark Knight.  Now you can take this portable version on vacation, travel, or to the gym for 2 1/2 hours of movie watching.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|First of all, I loved the first Iron Man.  It ranks as my favorite superhero movie of all time behind Batman.  However, unlike the re-envisioned Batman franchise, the sequel in this case does not transcend the original.    One of the best parts of the original Iron Man was just how hilariously \\"badass\\" Tony Stark was.  He knew he was a champ, and basically used his superior intellect and wit to overpower all of his opponents.  This doesn't carry through to this flick.  For most of the film, his usual eccentric behavior is marred by his obvious fear of death.  Knowing that he's dying, he foolish engages in random idiotic behavior until eventually the viewer is forced to say, \\"Grow the hell up bro!\\"  However, this movie is far from bad.  It still retains enough of its original charm to make it an enjoyable movie experience.  In addition, I loved Mickey Rourke's acting.  I've never heard of him before, but I'll be watching out for any future movies with him in it.  Fantastic job.      And on an off note, I didn't realize how dumb some of the plot elements in this movie are until a friend linked me a hilarious review about it on a random website.  I didn't really think about it while I was watching the film, but after I read this article I realized how ridonkulous it was for a \\"genius\\" to try to kill THE IRON MAN with an electric whip.  Not sure if linkings allowed but it's relevant so I'll add it anyway.  [...].  If anything, I enjoyed the movie even more because I started noticing all the hilarious stuff I'd missed before :D.    Overall, I'd give the film a 4/5.  The only thing I resented was the fact that Tony dropped about five notches on the \\"beast\\" scale.
0199233381|3.0|About ten pages into this, I found the book confusing (yes, I did finish it).  It wasn't that it was hard to read (although like many academics I've been reading recently Cartledge's phrasing is awkward, his jokes fall flat and he takes to inventing words).  It was really that I wasn't sure exactly what he was trying to achieve- and yes, I read the introduction.<br /><br />It seems Cartledge wants to give an \\"introduction\\" to the \\"themes\\" present in Ancient Greek history.  He wants to do this quickly by offering a brief history in rough chronological order of 11 important cities or, as we might want to say in this case, poleis (plural for polis or, roughly, city-state).  He does spend a few pages explaining that while we talk about the city, the city always included attached or associated country-side areas where the majority of the populations usually lived.  Thus, we're looking at a city-focused culture rather than an urban one.  Good to know- but then he does pretty much nothing with that theme for the rest of the book.<br /><br />The cities he covers are Cnossos, Mycenae, Argos, Miletus, Massalia, Sparta, Athens, Syracuse, Thebes, Alexandria and Byzantion.  You know more than half of these if you have a working knowledge of Greek myths (FYI, he spends very little time talking about the mythology except to cite it's historical implausibilities- and that's not a criticism).  You also know some of these cities under different names- Massalia is the modern-day Marseilles, and Byzantion has been known as Constantinople and Istanbul.  There were, of course, many other cities he could have covered (I'd still like to know why Corinth and Megara didn't make the cut), but he gives good reasons for why he chose these to cover the range of influences that Greece exerted.  He also does successfully make the point that the concept of \\"Greece\\" or even \\"Greek\\" came much later than identification with the polis, and that even when it did, it hardly discouraged conflict.<br /><br />Of course he spends a lot of time on Athens and just about apologizes for doing so.  He also spends a fair amount of time on Sparta, in part to debunk stereotypes (Sparta was NOT more evil than Athens, and Athenian democracy was both politically expedient and limited by design).  He notes that the Athenian model was looked upon with suspicion up until the 1830s when the United States repopularized the idea.<br /><br />A good amount of time is spent on Alexandria, and part of that is to discuss some of the rise and conquests of Alexander the Great of Macedon (no, Macedon does not get it's own section).  But not too much.  By the time we're done, he's moved onto Ptolemy, sidetracked a little into the Seleucid empire, moved back to Cleopatra, Antony and Caesar and recounted the destruction of the legendary Library of Alexandria.  All in 18 pages.<br /><br />Athens had a BS democracy; Spartans were a people of few words.  Early civilization thrived at Cnossos in Crete.  The \\"Greeks\\" had a bunch of cities on three continents (Europe, Asia and Africa).  But... so what?  Why?  What was the impulse or idea, other than survival?  Strangely enough, the theme of trade is rarely mentioned here.  There was *something* about Greek or Hellenic civilization that was special enough to be emulated by the Romans and their cultural descendants, but the end of the book, we're still not sure exactly what that was.<br /><br />It's not an entirely useless book- I didn't realize that Linear A was a Semitic language, for instance and it has a useful glossary, timeline and \\"who's who\\"- but this is only going to make you want to read more, and not necessarily in the good way.s a lot of time on Athens and just about apologizes for doing so.

B003R0LBVW|2.0|I can't believe that Oprah recommends this book.  I found it so hard to read because the writer is longwinded and doesn't know how to finish a sentence.  The characters were not likeable and I ended up hating all of them in the end.  I couldn't wait to finish it, which I only did because I needed to know if it ever got better.
0553805371|2.0|This book will persuade nobody. Scientists will continue to have their arguments agains the existence of God as creator of the universe, whereas religious people will say that the argument of the existence of 10 exp 500 universes is very weak (and not proven) to convince them in order to abandon their faith (which, in any way, is not based on reason only).  The dialogue between the two parties shall be more fruitful and substantial in the future, only in case physics solves its own problems (unified theory), a fact that might require the change of some of its basic assumptions and hypotheses of today.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is by far the one of, if not THE best, best books I've ever read. Some say the story gets narrative at times, but when it does, you want to know what's being said. It fills in parts of the story you have been itching to know.     Great book, the story keeps you wanting more. I'm glad I can just start reading the next book in the series, otherwise, I don't know if I could wait for it.    I know it gets old just seeing good reviews, and not so much the negative ones, but this book is that good.
B003YCI1PM|4.0|First i want to say that most of the bad ratings are about this album not having any rock, OF COURSE this album has basically no rock, that was Selena's(or at least the label company) entire point. There is no reason to rate this album badly for the true nature of what it is, IT IS a dance-pop/techno album..Plain & simple. I think more ppl should goggle the album before buying it.     So anyway, i like this album and i am very surprised that i do, it is HEAVY on the techno..but that's what i like so im fine with it. It isn't the most amazing album ever BUT i haven't really had a great album since the late 90's/Early 2000..so I'll give her a past lol!!    My favorite songs are: Basically MOST of the songs are my favorite.    *Rock God*-- But don't be fooled, this is not a rock song lol!  *Spotlight*-- VERY pop-ish w/ a little hip hop.  *Live Like there's no tomorrow*-- Kinda rock-ish.  *Off The chain*-- Very beautiful soft techno/trance song.  *A year without rain*.  *Round & Round*.
B002TVQ4GW|4.0|It's actually pretty cool. A little predictable, but still cool. It's graphic, so be ready for plenty of blood.
0811870413|5.0|I ordered this book since June 2010.  I had high expectations from it, which were covered in the book, techniques, formulations, tips.  The author shows his humility, by sharing accumulated knowledge, and his vision to make good bread.   The paradigm of secrets recipes by some bakers, it is swept by Chad, with a full description of the way he makes bread.  He shows the process it took to develop a kind of bread, which at first is a concept in his mind, by changing variables, amount of pre-ferments and leaven, flours blend, length of bulk fermentation.  I highly recommend you to buy this book, it will become a classic.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Out of the action kids movies (Pacifier,Escape to Witch Mountain...) this is one of my favorites. Brandon does an excellent job of acting like he normally does. The lead actress does a good job too. It's set in Iceland, but you really don't get to see much of the country. The graphics are moderate. Didn't seem to be a high budget movie.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Honestly, if you're not a Lost fan, you're not going to want this. You won't want this if you dont own or havent watch series 1 - 5! Its that simple.    If you do own them however, or you have seen those seasons, how can you not complete the experience without Season 6, the complete series, the final season, The End?  After watching all 18 (?) episodes, include two, double length episodes, you will be left completely satisfied, or, ironically, completely Lost.  But its alright, don't fret! Because now that there are no more spoilers, you can scour the internet for all those spoilers you swore you wouldnt ruin!    But quite honestly, I was satisfied to complete my many, many hours of Lost with the last season box set!  A very happy purchase, one Id recommend for any Lost fan.
B001JAFYFG|4.0|If you haven't seen it, the concept is pretty cool. I actually like the newer movie \\"The Island\\" better, but it is a take off of Logan's Run. Worth watching though.
0811876373|5.0|I have been waiting for the cake pops book for ever since I heard Bakerella was coming out with it. The book is amazingly done with tons of helpful pictures, tips and tricks! This is a must buy book for any fan of Bakerella's blog or anyone who loves creating cute and unique treats.
B001KMB6X2|3.0|So... it's corny. The opening scene sort of sets the tone. I am a Vin Diesel fan though, so I give it plenty of leeway. There are parts of the movie that seem really solid and thought out, but there are others that fail in a way that the 2nd and 3rd Matrix movies fail. They spend a little too much time with the religious parody. Anyhow, if you haven't seen it and you're sci fi fan, you should probably watch it. I've heard you should definitely get the directors cut. I haven't seen the non-directors cut, but I heard it was horrible.
0765326353|5.0|I REALLY liked this book. Could not put it down. My only disapointment is how long I need to wait for the 2nd book to come out (2012). I am a big fan of the Wheel of Time series, and The Stormlight Archive is without a doubt the next great series I have been looking for. The fighting and magic concepts are so cool!    Simple review but everything else you need to know starts on page 1.
B002RWKSII|4.0|I like this album,but it is not perfect.Brian Wilson's voice sounds better,the instrumentation is good and the songs sound great.But i think Brian Wilson uses too many of his own unique melodies/hooks in some of Gershwins songs.   Something Mr Wilson does a little too much of,i am not complaining i enjoy hearing music from him but sometimes its over familiar,not new.      I hope he releases new music or even old stuff i've never heard or heard finished. Out of ten,its a seven for me.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|Firstly, I went into \\"The Losers\\" with low expectations.  To be honest, I couldnt remember if it was it or it was The Expendables in my DVD list, so perhaps they were even lower.  Couple that with the fact it was based on a comic (and I'm not comic-hatin', believe me, I am however in general comic-movie-adaptation-hatin') and I was prepared with finger poised on the stop button.<br /><br />There really is no \\"down-time\\" in The Losers.  It starts running from minute 1, and pretty much goes full steam until minute 97.  I've always felt that, for the most part, if you can't say what you came to say in 90 minutes, you better have a great reason, and most movies do not.  The Losers doesnt have much to say, so perhaps this explains the brevity, but for pure escapist fun, its hard to beat.<br /><br />Far smarter than the promos would've led you to believe, this movie revels in its own wit and fast-moving humor as much as it does it's McG-style action editing, which did on occasion get a little old.  We've seen this type all before, and its been done slicker and harder (see: Smokin' Aces).  Still, that stop-motion CGI action has impact, and when combined with truly sharp acting (Jeffery Dean Morgan, in his usual subdued cool as well as Jason Patric playing the nut he probably is in real life), there is rarely a dull moment.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I watch a lot of movies, but buy relatively few anymore.  Most have solid qualities, but little replay value.  The Losers will go in the \\"own\\" category, and I hope they see a sequel, because they did the first one right.
0525951652|5.0|Just love this book. Could not Waite to get to start reading it . It has a lot of people involved in this book but after reading it and really getting into it I found myself involve with all of them. When I read my imagination is like a movie and I see all these people in a movie format. Unfortunately when I go see a movie of a book I have read it is often disappointing. If you can just keep going and read a few pages at a time you will get the story he is telling and will become engrossed with the characters . I am a voracious reader. Have a library full of my books . It is very hard for me to give a book away. I just love holding  a book in my hand and love the smell of the paper. But I digress. This so well written and if you can just hang in there it will all fall into place.
0307271862|5.0|Another Manning thriller to keep you up while you read it as fast as you can. Can't wait for his \\"final\\" Wallender book.
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|...You owe it to yourself to purchase this new 3 CD edition if only for the remastered Nassau show - which includes additional tracks. It's absolutely amazing and easily Bowie's best live record - yes, better than the Santa Monica Spiders show, and certainly better than David Live or Stage. A Reality Tour is great for latter day (and it appears his final album) but nothing comes close to the muscularity of this show.     An absolute must for Bowie fanatics, despite the show being nearly 35 years old, and pretty much for anyone who is a fan of a classic rock album and a class rock legend.
0805091742|5.0|I have followed Atul Gawande's thoughtful and engaging writing in The New Yorker for years. This expanded book version of his piece about the use of physicians' checklists when they perform certain procedures in hospitals or their offices should be required reading for all medical personnel.
0811876373|5.0|I received my CakePops ccokbook on Wednesday and by Friday had made the cutest \\"Owl Pops\\" for my niece's first birthday party!  Bakerella made the directions super easy to follow.  The cake pops were a huge success with everyone and needless to say, I can't wait to try my next batch...I'm super excited about the upcoming holiday season!
B0043HA1K0|3.0|I must be a little young and uncool to not realize that the album consists mostly of covers. I guess thats part of what you miss out on when you buy the MP3 album, so you don't have liner notes. Either way, the album is solid, and because it mostly covers of old funk and soul songs it should appeal to a broad range of people.  This is a safe bet as a gift.<br />However, its due to this apparent \\"safeness\\" that I did not love the abum.  The album starts out strong, but I felt that despite the great work of the band, that the arrangements themselves were either flat, or a little uninspired.  The title song \\"Wake Up\\" has some of the weakest \\"we can do it if we try\\" lyrics I've ever heard.  Its not a call to social action, its a song about \\"things are gonna be ok, so lets go do our jobs well.\\" yawn.<br />In all, the album reminds me of being at a Barack Obama rally (I actually did attend one). Before he came on, the music was similarly funky but safe. Its all inclusive, but in the end it has no teeth.  And that's why I have to give this album three stars.
0316067938|1.0|I just finished the Twilight series.  I actually liked the first book, but the plot holes and lack of character development just go downhill slowly from there.  There are tons of one star reviews on this site that summarize it better than I could and I encourage anyone who even THINKS about reading this book to read those reviews first - I wish I did!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|It would be hard not to recognize Lady Gaga's hit songs. We love them all, however what is wonderful about this CD is there are other sides to her artistry. Her range of music goes well beyond the dance hits we are hearing and seeing on VH1 and at the Grammy's. Please keep up the diversity of music!
B001HN694K|2.0|Even with the volume on the TV and speakers at their highest, it was impossible to hear the audio for this film.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|We were fortunate to hear Ms. Summer live at the 2010 Opening night of the Hollywood Bowl, where she was inducted into their Hall of Fame. Ms. Summer was THE Highlight of the evening, where we heard a couple of songs off this CD. After 'sampling' the rest of the tracks, it was clear this is a \\"must have\\" for any fan of Donna Summer. A great mix of new sounds along with songs that would fit right in the stylings of her greatest hits. All good. It gets regular play around our house.
0312600844|1.0|What you've got here is an episodic collection of headlines linked together by a very talented wordsmith. Novelists don't really write novels anymore. They write diatribes about current events and subjects that \\"concern\\" them and their immediate circle of friends. Claiming to write multi-faceted, complex explorations of our modern \\"predicament\\" what actually comes across is mere solipsistic drivel. I know there are great novels being written out there, they're just not being written by people like Jonathan Franzen. It's shallow and ultimately self-absorbed. No wonder Oprah likes it (or at least her assistants).
B001YB29HG|5.0|Great DVD. The movie is great and so are the commentries, especially the musical commentry. This DVD is a must have for any Joss Weddon fans and even if you're not.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|First of all, it's NOT a vacuum. Good grief, you shouldn't plan on this replacing a vacuum either. It's a sweeper and that's it.  I love it for my hardwood floors. It picks up better than any other sweepers I've had. Yes, I've gone through a battery on it, but only one battery in about 4  years.  It charges fine. It works fine. And, I habitually left in the charger for over 24 hrs a time because I'd just forget about it.  I KNOW that is not good for the battery life and is bound to wear down my battery at some point.  Sounds like there have definitely been a few duds in the batches of these products, but I can't say enough about it. Mine has worked GREAT!  I recommend it all the time!
0743454537|4.0|I started reading this book because my boyfriend was starting college and this was required for incoming freshmen. I had no interest in reading this book because I had heard what it was about. I got bored one night and borrowed it from him, just to read the first few pages, and Holy cow! I was hooked! The ending was not what I expected, but it was really interesting to read and I really enjoyed it. It's a controversial topic, but you'll enjoy it.
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|The quality of this blu-ray is excellent, but the show itself is out of control!  Amazing.  I watched the entire season SO quickly.  Creepy plot & wonderful performances.

0553805371|5.0|This book doesn't have the scornful tones of Dawkins or Hitchens, but it does promote scientific reason over myth and superstition, in this case for the spontaneous creation of our finely-tuned universe.    This book demonstrates that our best physical models (Quantum Mechanics, String Theory and M-Theory) predict that many universes are created spontaneously (as many as 10^500).  Our own universe happens to have the right mix to create carbon in supernovae, allow for stable stars that fuse for billions of years, and have the right number of outward-facing spatial dimensions to permit stable elliptical orbits.  This is why we highly-evolved life forms appear in this universe, because we had the right conditions (and plenty of time) to evolve here.  The argument that this one universe must have been carefully-designed is based on a flawed assumption--that there is only this one universe.  Sorry folks, but our best models say otherwise, and the evidence keeps backing those models.    The authors have left out much of the technical details, providing only the logical implications for the reader.  You would have to have \\"faith\\" that the authors are telling you the truth, as much as you'd have to have \\"faith\\" in any other explanation of the universe.  The difference is, the theory and research upon which these conclusions are based is publicly available.  You may need a Ph.D. to follow along, but at least the evidence is published, and peer-reviewed by some of our brightest minds.  Myth and superstition have no such credible backing.  So I'll put my faith were it is deserved, thank you very much!
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|Robert Downey Jr. continues down his comeback trail by reprising the role that made him the household name he always should have been (for the right reasons, anyway) as charismatic, fast-talking billionaire Tony Stark in Iron Man 2. The original 2007 film raised the bar for superhero films (a bar raised even higher by a certain Caped Crusader a few months later), and Iron Man 2 strives to match that mark. But unfortunately, it misses said mark.    When we last saw Stark, he was commiting the superhero cardinal sin - he admitted to the world that he is Iron Man, the armored sentinel of justice. Of course, this has upped his notoriety exponentially, but has also raised the ire of a whole new crop of enemies. The U.S. government wants Stark to give up the Iron Man \\"weapon\\" for military use, a campaign spearheaded by Senator Stern (Gary Shandling). Rival weapons dealer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) wants to put Stark Industries out of business. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of the man who helped Tony's father create the ARC reactor that powers the Iron Man suit and keeps Tony alive, builds his own battle suit and becomes Whiplash in order to exact revenge on Tony.     You'd think that would be enough to fill one movie, but no. On top of these foes, the ARC reactor in Tony's chest is slowly poisoning him. A new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannsen), is much more than a pretty face. Stark's best friend Rhodey (Don Cheadle, replacing Terence Howard), suits up as Iron Man's ally War Machine, and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is pressuing Stark to join The Avengers. Phew.    With Iron Man 2, director Jon Favreau feels the customary obligation to overachieve in order to out-do its predecessor, but its failure lies in just that. There's so much going on here, that you feel like you could make an Iron Man 3 out of half the stuff. What's worse is that some of the elements seem needless. Involving Nick Fury and Black Widow seems to serve more asa build-up to the upcoming Avengers movie than to serve Iron Man 2's actual plot, and Tony Stark hands over the CEO reins of Stark Industries to Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) seemingly just to give her something to do. This all helps to create a frivolous, unmomentous feel to the film, leaving the film lacking in emotional weight.    But that doesn't mean that the film doesn't have redeeming qualities. Robert Downey Jr.'s sly, witty portrayal of Tony Stark is like a beacon among a crowded cast of characters. And though the cast feels bloated, the characters are very well fleshed out, so much so  that it almost doesn't matter that the film is quite frankly light on action. But when the action does kick in, it's done very well. I just wish we got to see a little more. Like the original film, there's an extra zinger of a scene after the credits, but Iron Man 2's big reveal is not quite as \\"geektastic\\" as the surprise appearance of Sam Jackson's Nick Fury.    The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Pack allows you to watch the movie in just about every way possible, and includes commentary by Favreau, making-of documentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and deleted scenes. Also included is a S.H.I.E.L.D. Data Vault feature which includes bios of not just the Iron Man film characters but bios of other Marvel Films character (like The Incredible Hulk) that can be updated in the future with an internet connection, which will likely include Thor and Captain America, as those characters' films are aiming for a release next year.    In summary, the film is enjoyable, the characters are good, Robert Downey Jr. once again shines, and the action is well done, though the film feels overstuffed and a bit inconsequential. The extras are what you'd normally find on DVD's and Blu-Rays, though the updatable S.H.I.E.L.D. Vault is a creative touch.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|I found this movie to be one of the better DC Animated movies that I have seen. Loved the storyline and the action. Felt that it did Batman as a whole justice especially seeing him deal with what is portrayed as his greatest failure. Just the emotional expressions on his face is classic since you don't expect much emotion from Batman. I think this is a must have for any Batman Fan.

0380729407|5.0|Most of what needs to be said has been said above, but I'd like to add a word about Bradbury's lexical enthusiasm. Too many folks here knocking him for 'swallowing the thesaurus' or summat. What a dumbed-down, pathetic bunch of quasi-illiterate prats! Some folks could (can) write like that without dictionary, thesaurus, assistance or therapy. They did/do it for fun, for the sheer joy of language, for the ping-pong of Joyce, Woolf and Faullker versus Hemingway, Mailer and Co, avalanches of colour versus perfectly composed black and white. Bradbury never needed the paranoid little forewords that whinged about fantasy and sci-fi being peripheral to literature. He could write, late 50's/early 60's-style, and do it well. To judge him by the cretinous reductionism of the post-post modern is anachronistic, patronising and unfair. Sod off and complain about Moby Dick if you want to pick holes in language.

B002BWP4A6|3.0|I thought this film was very interesting, and kept us guessing, but we couldn't help but just look at one another when it ended and saying...WHAT??? We wanted some answers at least.  Give me some closure PLEASE!
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Excellent show on DVD and I did enjoy the ending to the show. We all knew that there was a religious side of this show so why are people so upset with the ending? We have the LIGHT, JACOB, CHRISTIAN, SHEPARD, JOHN etc.... we had the destructive black cloud that followed people around, there were people being judged and sacrificed, so why the confusion of what all of this meant? This program could go on using the black smoke alone but the characters were excellent and their goal at the end was the goal of life , to enter heaven for an eternity. Thanks LOST CAST you were the best.............William King

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|There is a new \\"Supergroup\\" in town, Black Country is their name and their new CD \\"Black Country Communion\\" has just hit the stores.  This is the third grouping of this kind to spring up on the listening public in as many years.  First, we had \\"Chickenfoot\\", resulting from the nucleus of Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony from the ashes of Van Halen, Chad Smith from The Red Hot Chili Peppers and guitar god Joe Satriani on what else but guitar.  They had released a concert DVD a few months ago so I guess they are still functioning as a working \\"Band.\\"  Second, we have or had \\"Them Crooked Vultures\\", being a blend of Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters, Josh Gromme from Queens of the Stone Age and Classic Rock Legend John Paul Jones from Led Zeppelin.  Not quite sure what their status is at this time.  Now we have \\"Black Country\\", a band of individuals put together by producer Kevin Shirley.  The lineup consisting of \\"The Voice of Rock\\", Glenn Hughes on Bass and lead vocals, Jason Bonham (son of the late great John Bonham of Led Zeppelin fame) on drums, Derek Sherinian (Dream Theater) on keyboards, and blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa showing he can rock out when given the chance.  They have put together a 12 track CD that will have Classic Rock listeners already getting in line to buy tickets.  Let's take a look at what they have to offer and see if it is worth your listening time and possibly your money.<br />  A little history lesson for those unaware that Glenn Hughes was a member of Deep Purple for 3 studio albums in the `70's as well as Black Sabbath for close to a year somewhere around 1986.  He started out as a founding member of Trapeze and provided either backing or lead vocals to acts to numerous to list here but to put it one way, the man has been around. The lead off track, \\"Black Country\\" starts everything off well enough, equal doses of rock and funk with a very up-tempo beat.  Joe shows his soloing ability on this with a flashy string bending wah wah flavored explosion.  The following track, \\"One Last Soul\\", the catchiest song of the bunch has a memorable chorus that continues to haunt hours after hearing it.  Most of the songs have that Glenn Hughes funk groove going on with Jason Bonham keeping it rock `n' roll.  The two lock in together and form a very tight rhythm section throughout.<br />  At first listen, the entire album has the feeling of a Glenn Hughes solo release with an incredible backing band.  A few more listens and you realize just how each member brings his A game to the project and the blend sounds very natural.  At times, this resembles Bad Company's debut (a group formed from the ashes of Free, Mott the Hoople, & King Crimson) so many years ago with catchy songs) and the comparison rings true when Joe sings lead vocals on 2 tracks, similar to the soulful voice of Paul Rodgers.  They do a version of Trapeze's \\"Medusa\\" here, more atmospheric than the `70's original.  The last track here is \\"Too Late for the Sun\\", an epic eleven minute plus extravaganza jam highlighting each member's playing ability.  The vocals at times so sweet, the ever present yet changing bass line, the buffet of guitar riffs and chops, drumming that at times prepares to jump out of its own skin and keyboards that have been more textural throughout the other songs get a chance to take center stage.  Remember, over eleven minutes long, it is the showcase track if you have the time.<br />  Blind Faith, Cream, Travelling Wilburys, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Emerson, Lake, & Palmer, Bad Company are just some of the names of a few of the Supergroups in popular music.  It is time to add the name of Black Country to that illustrious list with an album that is made for a tailgate party or taking a long trip.  Either way, you will be listening to it for a long time to come and hearing something new on each repeat listen.  I recommend this highly to anyone who loves Classic Rock.sion.

B0044430H8|4.0|I'm not going to go into the specifics of the sound on this album. most of the reviewers have hit it dead on with the \\"Ghosts I-IV\\" references. In fact, this is where the soundtrack got its start, since TR was sending Dave Fincher ghost tracks initially to see how it would go with the movie and they just developed the sound from there (in fact there are 2 songs from ghosts on here if you listen).<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to buy this then you should go here to buy the album<br />[...] (Look title of this review for website since amazon won't let me post a direct link. then follow the directions on the main NIN page)<br /><br />not only can you sample 5 of the tracks for free, but if you decide to buy you have the option of downloading the lossless version also for the same price with the MP3 included. I don't know about you, but i prefer better quality sound as well as supporting the artist directly :)
B003UYV08E|2.0|I saw Iron Man a couple of years ago and thought it was flawed, but servicable. My wife and I just saw Iron Man 2 over the weekend and were really not very impressed.  Here are a couple of thoughts on it that may be helpful:    (i) Dialouge  As you have probably heard, this movie is big into dialouge and \\"character development\\" (At least, I think that's the term directors use when they unnecessarily load action movies down with lots of talky filler).  Most of these interactions are just grating and annoying (eg. Tony and Pepper; Tony and Rhoddy; Tony and Senator Stern; Tony and Justin Hammer; Tony and Nick Fury, etc.) Bickering, talking over each other, and being generally cheesed off at one another are not the same thing as witty dialouge or clever ripostes.  His Girl Friday this ain't.    (ii) The Main Character  In the first movie, Tony Stark was smug, but also ironic and interesting; in fact, despite the first movie's faults, I thought its protagonist was a refreshing antidote to all the dark conflicted loners you find in every other superhero movie.  In the sequel, Tony Stark is just a rich, obnoxious, jerk, mostly drunk and disrespectful to everyone else including his friends.  I don't like spending two hours with obnoxious, rich jerks.     (iii) Action  Not a whole lot of action in this one and not really anything that was overly impressive.  If you have seen the trailers to the movie, you've seen pretty much all there is to see. The final confrontation between Iron Man, War Machine and Whiplash lasts about 60 seconds or so.    (iv) Plot  MINOR SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW ******  The plot is.... well, there really is not much of a plot, as much as there is a basket of interrelated half-concepts tied together. It reminded me a little of The Phantom Menance where George Lucas decided he wanted certain elements (eg. a pod race; a space battle; a lightsaber fight) and then wrote a thin story to incorporate them.  The plot that does exist has holes a mile wide, lots of loose ends and a lot of stuff that goes nowhere.  As an example, Black Widow is written in, but really does nothing of note (she is a secret agent disguised as a notary in Stark Industries; even though her boss tells her that she is onto her, they are confidants in the next scene).  Nick Fury and SHIELD are introduced for the sole purpose of promoting Thor and The Avengers.  Jon Favreau writes in a fairly large role for himself (including an incredibly implausable action scene) which contributes nothing to the plot and is really for the sole purpose of giving himself some screen-time.   In sum, it felt like either the product of a committee or a bunch of last minute re-writes or re-edits.    (v) Embedded Advertising  Lots and lots of annoying promotional tie-ins from watches to software to cars to upcoming movies are scattered throughout.  They don't even try to be subtle.     Conclusion:  So, is it worth your $14.99 and Saturday night?  No, it really isn't.  There are a bunch of great summer movies that are just now making their way to DVD.  I would strongly recommend that you take a second look at those (Inception, anyone?) before putting your money down for this one.
044024238X|5.0|I honestly love Sophie Kinsella's books with a passion and this one didn't disappoint me. I agree... it's unrealistic but it's a lovely laugh out loud story. I'm sure most people will enjoy it. If you're looking for something serious and dramatic, you might as well skip Kinsella but if you're looking for a fun read, this is definitely a great option.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I, quite simply, loved this book. I didn't love the premise nor did I love the ending but any book that can hold my attention and make me think makes me grateful for those authors who are willing to stray from normalcy.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|When I bought my first Kindle I made a promise to myself and Amazon that I would never, not ever, pay more than $9.99 for a book.  I've got to believe this is an ebook price sensitivity test. What price will the market bear?  For me it's $9.99.  As has been said before, write your 1 star review stating the reason as the egregious price, do NOT buy Fall of Giants (Mr. Follett will survive), and avoid buying books from this publisher in the future.  No sale here.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This product is just like new. It is in amazing condition and was listed at an amazing value. My hope was to start all over again since I started watching Grey's when it came out and didn't keep up. Amazing addition to my collection.
0953104907|4.0|I purchased this book along with Martin Koch's book so that I could built my own Strat style guitar.  I have recently finished two such instruments based on the information in these two books plus the help of an internet forum.  I found both books to be necessary and kept going back and forth.  This book is much more step-by-step oriented and takes you through 3 different builds.  If you are going to build a guitar very similar to one of the three illustrated, you could do it with just this book.      That said Hiscock's book is very well written and I referred to it over and over.  Definately a good purchase and I recommend it.    My only complaint is the quality of the book binding.  Within the first 10 days of owning the book pages started coming loose from the binding.  With careful use I have managed to keep it mostly together but I can tell I will have to do something or pages will be lost or destroyed.    As a heads up to the potential guitar builder.  This book assumes you have pretty advanced woodworking skills and at least access to (if not ownership of) woodworking equipment.  I have been woodworking for 25 years and found building the body pretty straight forward.  The neck was challenging, however.  In addition to typical hand tools I used my bandsaw, tablesaw, router, drill press, planer and jointer.   I definately wouldn't want to go without the bandsaw or the router.  Also you will need to design and make full size templates so knowledge of CAD or basic drafting is helpful.

0439023521|5.0|WOW! Can I just say, WOW! This is a great, great, great, GREAT book! Everyone should read this. I picked it up on a whim because, well, someone told me it was Dystopian, and I didn't really know what that meant. Bravo to the author. Excellently done!
B003UERZ88|2.0|I was looking forward to purchasing this album because I admire both Metal Mike and Roy Z, and also because, being titled \\"Made of Metal\\" and made by the Metal God, this couldn't be but a great metal album, right? Well, my expectations were up there when I put it into my CD player... but man, I'm now completely disappointed. :-(    Firstly, Roy Z and Metal Mike still shred and all, but their playing is generic and their sound is sterile all along this album. Secondly, I can still live with cliché-loaded, thin-sounding solos and predictable guitars riffs; but if you add to them the cheesiest lyrics I've ever heard in my life, this is starting to be too much. What's all this sport-related blah-blah after all? Plainly said, this release just lacks of taste --besides lacking of \\"spheres\\", of course.    Luckily, I survived until the end of the album and was positively surprised by the heavy, tight riffing on \\"The Mower\\". The fiery voice of Rob on that very song is also one of the few positive points deserving to be highlighted.    But no, the remaining of the album is absolutely forgettable, in spite of the heavy energy that still shows, even after all these years.    Final score then, like in sports: 2 stars --I'm trying to show some respect anyway. In few words, buy it if and only if you are an unconditional fan. However, if you just like \\"Resurrection\\" and \\"Painkiller\\", go for something better. You'll thank me, believe me...(chug-chug-chug \\"sad but trueeahhh!\\")
0312360258|4.0|This book is soooooo good! in fact, I've liked several of the books. I hope the series keeps on track. It's not for the younger YA audience, since there is some sexual stuff, but I'd say everyone over 16 should read this book!
B0030IIZ1A|5.0|This is the classic legendary all-time favorite animated movie. I have watch it over and over many time. I bought both TS1 & TS2 on Blu-ray once they came out, just in time for TS3 coming out. Don't miss this great hit, your kids will love it now and everafter.
B002N5N5LG|2.0|Maybe I just don't get it.  After hearing about this show all year and reading the massive amounts of praise heaped on the show by my fellow Amazonians (almost 40 reviews and every single one of them are 5 stars?!), I'm left to wonder what all the fuss was about.  I watched the first two disks and had to drag myself through the last two just to see whether it got any more interesting, but it just didn't.  There were very few laugh out loud moments for me (the Forest Whitaker Eye bit cracked me up, I must admit), and it just seemed like the show was trying to be a bit too clever for its own good.    For all of that, I like the supporting cast.  Winger and Britta (the leads) are uniteresting, but Abed and Troy, along with Pierce and Dean Pelton are occasionally funny.  Señor Chang is the one character that consistently does it for me, and I look forward to whenever he appears.    Also, if you like the show, this set is a fantastic value for the money.  There are twenty+ episodes with commentary for each one (!!!), and a bunch of other special features.  All for less than $20??  You kidding?  Sign me up!  Or not, since I didn't care for the show, but I wish other box sets would follow this one's lead!    Count me as one that just can't buy into the hype.  Maybe I'll rent parts of the next season to check on its progress, but I won't hold my breath.  Frasier and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia don't do it for me either and they are/were much beloved, so maybe it's just a lack of taste on my part.
044656740X|5.0|For anyone trying to find out the answer to, how do I get out of my dead end job? How do I make more money? Or any question like this. Most of have been there, we do what we where taught. \\" Work hard, be polite, but a house, build a life\\" and everything will be fine, right?    In my 40 years of life, I had to question the wisdom of my school and life education and this book for me, threw some light on the many questions that I had.    This is a guide book on how to think differently and how that can help, I only wish I knew about this book sooner. I recommend that everyone buy this book and with hope they will start to teach some of this stuff in regular school.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|As far as the CDs themselves go the picture quality is great ... But I found the ending disappointing and a bit strange!    I was a big fan of Lost -- but I never watched it on TV because I cannot deal with the commercials, I would simply wait for the seasons to be released on DVD and watch the season in its entirety commercial-free. For those of you who may have done the same and have not yet purchased the 6th and final season I would never divulge the ending -- all I will say is that it could have been better!  Happy viewing!!
B0000C5096|5.0|Part 3 of my excursion into New Hendrix Vinyl.......let's go!<br />Got this from a third party Amazon dealer described as like<br />new but it wasn't. The Vinyl itself was dirty but cleaned up<br />very well and once I put it on the turntable, well, holy Moly<br />Good Golly Miss Molly, an Audiophile pressing!! A few pops<br />here and there but that's to be expected. Surface noise is<br />minimal. Very Quiet surface and the music itself made my<br />arm hair stand on it's edge! Once again, this is the Out Of<br />Print MCA pressing and both discs are dead on Flat and pressed<br />ON Center!! And also 180 gram, very thick and a pleasure, once<br />I cleaned them, to behold. A very Slightly Loose performance, you<br />can tell Jimi was a bit frazzled, but the audience vibe moved him<br />and the band came a callin'!! Great pressing-get it while you can,<br />I got mine for $21 with shipping, even in a good state cover wise,<br />the vinyl comes through and the album is very very enjoyable.<br />I guess the lesson I'm starting to learn is: If you want to get the<br />best sounding Hendrix vinyl, maybe you should start by picking<br />up the Out Of Print, but still available MCA pressings, they seem<br />to all be on 180 gram virgin vinyl and the packaging is as good<br />as the current EH offering. But the pressings seem, so far, MUCH<br />better than the current pressings. More to come with the Box Set<br />8 LP called 'The Jimi Hendrix Experience'!<br />Oh, I also compared this with my EH cd of the Berkeley show, and<br />once again, for sheer FIDELITY-this Audiophile 180 gram pressing<br />demolishes the cd. SO NATURAL SOUNDING!!<br />Gerard Masters
B001N1DPDE|5.0|It's hard to add to the raving reviews that have been posted here but I felt obligated to try. The Becker Campanion is a survival knife in the truest sense. No bells or whistles just a workhorse of a knife. As stated so many times this is a 1/4\\" piece of sharpened steel meant for hard use. If your looking for lightweight-don't buy it, if your looking for Hollywood type characteristics-don't buy it. If you need a knife that will perform in wood processing, game prep, and other harsh outdoor tasks and want it at a reasonable price. Then buy it.  Lastly, let me say I have many knives. Many high quality outdoor knives that I have spent triple the amount on than the Becker Campanion. Many times they get left home now and the Becker goes in the bush with me. I remain certain that should you choose to purchase this knife you would not regret the decision. Hope this helps.
B001A2ADTA|2.0|Part 4 or am I counting???  Got this from a good third party seller, sealed/brand new from Amazon  and once I got it on the turntable....Dang......Not only is it pressed off   center, but it's warped and noisy during EXP! It cleaned up after that  song but it killed the whole vibe. So, Classic records has this reputation  for these incredible sounding records, but at $30, I'm not only NOT   impressed, I'm very skeptical about any more Classic pressed lp's.   But, there are plenty of other Hendrix Vinyl offerings out there so I'm  not worried about it. But, once bitten, twice shy, especially at $30 a pop  in this economy.   Now, the Audio part is very interesting. Sure it doesn't have the impact  of the stereo version, but listening to the whole album on headphones,   it IS a valid alternative to the stereo, that is to say, especially Mitch's  drums just DRILL you with a force that's not on the stereo mix. And Jimi's  vocals, being dead center and mixed high, put a slightly more powerful  sound experience that you simply don't get on the stereo version.  But other than that, there is nothing revelatory about the mono mix.  But I'm glad I bought it and am waiting for my replacement to get here.   So, Classic Records: -1. MCA pressings +2  more later........  Gerard Masters
B00007LTIC|4.0|By 1977 and the release of \\"Going for the One,\\" Yes seems to have learned that just because a band *can* release albums with only one or two songs per side, it doesn't mean that said band *should* always do so.  In the wake of \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" and \\"Relayer,\\" albums that went gold in their time but make for rather turgid listening nowadays, the members of Yes had the good sense to shorten at least some of their songs and leaven the sometimes heavy qualities of their work with a few welcome flashes of humor.  The album's title track benefits from the manner in which Steve Howe's guitar and Chris Squire's bass work together, sliding through some subtle time changes into a guitar-based rocker notable for Jon Anderson's self-mocking reference to \\"my cosmic mind.\\"  \\"Turn of the Century,\\" one of the album's longer numbers, features lovely acoustic-guitar work by Howe, with Rick Wakeman's keyboards providing supporting texture; a bit discursive in places, but pleasant and evocative overall, with a fine anthemic quality toward the end.  Organ and bass combine powerfully on the energetic \\"Parallels,\\" and the gentle and lyrical \\"Wonderous Stories\\" provides a fine showcase for Anderson's soaring vocals.  \\"Awaken,\\" the longest song on the album, wanders some in the middle, but features fine drum work from Alan White.  Noteworthy among the extra songs added for this CD re-release is Chris Squire's high-register bass-guitar take on \\"Amazing Grace.\\"  \\"Montreux's Theme\\" is a satisfactory guitar-and-keyboard jam, and \\"Vevey (Revisited)\\" is a lovely organ-and-guitar duet with a church-like, spiritual quality; both titles presumably have to do with the album's having been recorded in Switzerland.  Overall, a fine and strong album that shows the powerful work of which Yes was capable.
B001G9F9IW|5.0|I don't write many reviews here.  I don't really have the time.  After reading some reviews here I had to write one.    When I first saw this film I didn't think too much of it.  I did like it and it stayed in my head for several days afterward.  When it came out on video I found myself buying it.  I just had to see it again.  I've watched it about 3 times since.    I think the film is unrealistic as some people have mentioned here.  A poet who lives in a beautiful Spanish villa, no one else seems to be short of money.  I don't know many artists who live like the lead character here in a beautiful home with a swimming pool with large rooms.  But there is something very interesting here.    I think I like what is says.  Sometimes we think we know what we want but it's not really what we want.  It's what we think we are supposed to do.  What everyone around us expects us to do. What would happen if we just said 'to hell with it' and did whatever we wanted with whomever we wanted to do it with?    I appreciated the ambiance and the beautiful, charming scenery and the fact that the characters were bold enough to experiment with their lives a bit.  Not for everyone but I think some people will appreciate this.
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|Ive been a life long Clapton fan and have seen him many times.  He is great to see live. But the solo stuff he has recorded for   the last ten years has been really hard for me to enjoy. Most  recordings have had one or two songs I like, this CD has 4 songs  I like. The things I had grown to enjoy in his earlier music, the passion and  fire are for the most part long gone from these solo recordings. Its no different  on this one, allot of very boring elevator music that we would have said  our parents liked to listen to. The sad thing is I know he still has it in him,  but for whatever reason he has picked allot of tired old songs. Maybe he's trying  to please these \\"Tears in Heaven\\" & \\" Change the World \\" fans and forgot about us   who were with him from the begining.
B003SWU9R6|4.0|I wouldn't say this is his best album...  But it is a good one  Metaphorically speaking, this is the college chick you used to have \\"fun\\" with that went too far and now is a born-again virgin.  He still is sick with the lyrics and I'm happy for him kicking his habits...  BUT I am sorry to say I liked the carefree drug-head Em. That's the one I met and that's my favorite.  This album would be better if it were someone else's, only because of the enormity of the \\"old\\" Em.  It is still a good album though.  Appropriately titled... for better or worst.
0761158464|4.0|This is the first scanimation book that I have ever read.  Basically, every 2-page spread is moving scene from one of the Star Wars theatrical movies.  And \\"moving\\" does not only infer emotional, but specifically the illustration is of the type that changes as you tilt the page in different angles with respect to your eyes.  The different scenes chronologically highlight main scenes from the 6-movie arc.  The only drawback is that the scenes are unevenly balanced.  There are 4 scenes from Episodes 1, 2 and 3, and the rest are from Episodes 4, 5 and 6, with only one scene from Return of the Jedi.  And the front cover is wasted, as it has a scene that is repeated later on in the book.  Overall however, this book is quite entertaining, and takes about 10 minutes to read.
B0034G4P7Q|3.0|WARNING, SOME SPOILERS.<br /><br />HIAKU SUMMARY:<br />Hmm... Facebook movie<br />Somehow less engaging than<br />I had expected<br /><br />I'll admit I quite enjoyed this film while watching at the theatre, but however on the walk to the LRT station after, the novelty was soon wearing off, as all I could think about was the major missed opportunities. Minus the Benjamin Button adaptation (which sucked), I'd never have thought that this would happen with a Fincher flick. And furthermore, I was quite baffled to log on and see all the glowing reviews of this film. Really? an 8.7??<br /><br />This isn't a bad film strictly speaking, but it isn't a good one either. It's dialogue is great, as is the music by Trent Reznor (I loved the funky Hall Of The Mountain King in the race scene, and as is the acting and directing, so I really can't come down on it hard on the fact that it's, for the most part, a well made film.<br /><br />Of course there's going to be award buzz for this film, it was directed by David Fincher. The acting is really great, in fact it's PHENOMENAL. The best thing about the acting (and the entire film) is Andrew Garfield's performance, as I will be baffled if he doesn't get nominated.<br /><br />Now like I said, I enjoyed it while I was watching it. But lately I've been thinking about it and I can't say it's a very good film.<br /><br />The film skips back and forth between the trial and the events which surrounded the making of The Facebook. This works in the first half, hut then once Sean Parker comes in, it gets annoying, as the cutting back and forth becomes increasingly constant. Why can't you just show the whole unadulterated scene? Is it really that important to show Eduardo saying it as opposed to the words come out of Sean Parker's mouth, or to show Eduardo saying \\"Then he said\\" then cut to Sean Parker? If you're gonna cut back and forth and ruin the suspense of a scene, why even include it at all?<br /><br />This is an example of the \\"patches\\".I mentioned in the title. The film is patched together as opposed to having a seamless story being told. 75% of the film takes place in the office during the lawsuits and depositions. At this point the suspense is ruined for us because we already know Eduardo is suing mark. So why give it away early in the if you *want* to give the audience a reason to care about the characters?<br /><br />Another thing wrong with the film is that the theme isn't easily made across very easily. The most glaring example is a powerful scene near the end where Eduardo, the jealous soul, gives Mark, a jerk, hell for offering him a below-cost check. It's powerful, it's well acted, even hard to watch. But it's missing the most important thing: The overall theme. We don't get anything about jealousy and/or greed. At the end, We see Mark add his former girlfriend add her as a friend on facebook. Does this say anything about the ass he really is? About how crap of a boyfriend he is and even furthermore, how crappy of a businessman he is, that he became the youngest billionaire in the world for the wrong reasons? No. It doesn't say anything about being an ass. Like I said, the theme is missing.<br /><br />In short, this isn't a bad film. Like I said it's well shot, acted, and directed, but it's not a good film either- when it's good it's good, when it's bad, it's bad. I think IMDb needs to overhaul its rating system, as how this has a rating of 8.7 baffles me.to having a seamless story being told. 75% of the film takes place in the office during the lawsuits and depositions.

0380730405|4.0|\\"Rebecca\\" had several elements that I loved:  a large Gothic-style manor, ghosts, mystery and suspense.  In the book, the narrator (in which interestly her first name is never revealed) is a young English lady of twenty-one, who is working as a \\"companion\\" to a middle-aged American gossip-loving socialite.  The young lady and her employer are staying at a hotel in Monte Carlo, where the young lady is introduced to Maxim de Winter, the owner of a large English manor house called Manderley who has lost his wife in a tragic drowning one year prior.  Mr. de Winter is a strange, serious man which everyone attributes to the loss of his wife, Rebecca.<br /><br />The narrator and Mr. de Winter have an odd relationship over the course of the couple of weeks in Monte Carlo and when the narrator is told she is to go to New York, Mr. de Winter proposes marriage.  The narrator, longing for something more in life, agrees to marry him.  She is deeply in love with him, although he often remains distant and mysterious.  She expects that life at Manderley will be quite different from what she actually finds once she arrives there.<br /><br />Although the first Mrs. de Winter is no longer living, there are traces of her all throughout the mansion.  The new Mrs. de Winter is told how wonderful Rebecca was and is very insecure in herself in that she feels she can't live up to Rebecca's reputation.  Rebecca's maid, the eerie Mrs. Danvers, immediately dislikes the new Mrs. de Winter.  As days go by at Manderley, the new Mrs. de Winter begins to have serious doubts that her marriage will be successful and that the house she is living in is still under Rebecca's influence.  Maxim becomes more and more distant and odd, and the narrator becomes more uneasy and afraid, as is understandable as the mystery of what happened to Rebecca is unraveled.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the author's writing style - vivid descriptions with each scene set up nicely.  The author did a remarkable job of creating a suspenseful atmosphere.  Although I saw some of the mysteries of Rebecca's fate coming well ahead of time, there were still some new surprises waiting for this reader.  I would liken reading the book to walking through a large, historic manor house like Manderley, with each turn and hallway revealing another twist in the story and finding surprises all along the way.  I've seen other reviews that have said they found the book slow and dull, but I didn't want to put it down until every mystery was solved.<br /><br />My only letdown of the novel was that even while Rebecca was not a nice person, I found it very weak for the main character to stand by Maxim de Winter so faithfully after what he had done.<br /><br />After the story ended, I found it helpful to reread the first couple of chapters to be happily fulfilled with the ending.
B001DE29SS|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. should have gotten the Oscar for his performance. Wonderful film, Wonderful Acting! A must have for any film collection. I would also add an interesting look at the time and it's politics. Especially J. Edgar Hoover and his power and views, very similar to those striving for power now.

B00000F1D3|5.0|Cher's comeback album, \\"Believe\\", not only proved to the world that she had staying power in an industry that swallows careers thoughtlessly, but proved she could endear herself to a whole new generation of fans. Regarded as Cher's disco album, once the single \\"Believe\\" was released to radio stations, DJ's couldn't get it on the radio fast enough due to the many requests by listeners. \\"Believe\\" was also a huge dance single ultimately winning Cher the Grammy for Best Dance recording. The \\"Believe\\" album was certified Quadruple Platinum meaning it had sold four million copies in the United States. The record would ultimately sell 20,000,000 copies worldwide becoming Cher's highest selling album in her remarkable career.<br /><br /> \\"Believe\\" has really held up well over the last twelve years since its initial release. The songs are not dated which proves that the material Cher chose for this project was impeccably worked on by both the artist and her producers.<br /><br /> The title single would stay at #1 for an amazing four week run. Other outstanding tracks are \\"Strong Enough\\", \\"All or Nothing\\", \\"Runaway\\", and \\"The Power\\".
0312370849|3.0|I was stuck in the Charlotte airport and was browsing in the bookstore and saw one lonely copy of Sarah's Key. I had heard from a few people it was a really good book, so I picked it up. (Airports are one of the few places where I'll buy new books).    Sarah's Key is a historical novel in which Julia, an American ex-pat living in Paris, who through a confluence of work responsibility and personal ties, begins researching the story of a Jewish girl who is picked up by the French police as a part of the Vel' d'Hiv' round-up in 1942. For the first 150 pages or so, the chapters flip-flop between Julia's life in present day Paris and Sarah's life in 1942 Paris. About mid-way through the book, Sarah's voice drops out as Julia continues her research and gets closer to discovering Sarah's fate. Eventually, we learn through Julia what happened to Sarah and the impact her story continued to have on people's lives sixty-plus years later, despite it being hidden for so long.    The part of the book focused on Sarah and Vichy France was fascinating. I don't know much about what happened in France during World War II and I had never heard of the Vel' d'Hiv' round-up. Sarah's Key shed some light on the complex relationship the French government and people had with the Nazis during the occupation and the varying reactions to what was going on in their home country. On the flip side, the part of the book about Julia's life didn't really do it for me. It wasn't bad, it just didn't add that much to the overall arc of the book - and I'm all about connecting history with current events and trying to apply the lessons learned. Ultimately, I just found Sarah's part of the story much more compelling, but I still ripped through it during my time in the Charlotte airport and the flight home, so clearly it wasn't that bad.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Cher's \\"Farewell Tour\\" DVD was filmed in Miami, Florida and was originally an NBC television special. In this concert, billed as Cher's final concert tour, the diva proves why she has been in the business for over forty years and why she has staying power. She performs songs that she is most famous for, everything from the old Sonny and Cher classics, to her early seventies material like \\"Half Breed\\", to her oustanding comeback song \\"Believe\\". If you are a true Cher fan you cannot miss out on owning one of the greatest concert specials ever filmed. From the music, to Cher's beautiful Bob Mackie costumes, to Cher's various wig hairstyles, this lady is the ultimate diva. Another great part of the concert is seeing Cher's interaction with the audience, an audience who has proven their love for her over and over.<br /><br /> The DVD is filled with bonus features including three songs deleted from the special including her smash hit \\"Save Up All Your Tears\\", the music video \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\", a documentary, interviews, and much more.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|I had my reservations about seeing this remake.  Most remakes are not worth the time it took to make them, let alone spend $10-15 watching them.  This one was a pleasant surprise.  The premise speaks to our times in that you have a single woman moving up the ladder at her job, but she is also the mother of a preteen.  It is clear that times have not been kind to either of them, and the move to a different country is a daunting adventure, but she makes every effort to prepare her son for the journey.  What she does not foresee is the rejection her child will receive.  The scenes of bullying Dre receives are brutal, but no less so than what countless children face daily in this country.  The arrival of Jackie Chan's character brings the story to a whole new level as one is not sure if he is going to turn his back on the boy as well since he does not seem to be very sociable in the first place.  The seriousness of Chan's character lends more credibility to the role of master than the somewhat comical teacher of the older movie.  It is clear that the goal is not to just teach his student survival skills, but to guide him to the deeper, truer nature of the martial art of Kung Fu.  Rarely does one see a movie treat this art with the respect and appreciation that it deserves than it does in this movie.  Smith held his own in scenes with the elder Chan, and, in fact, held the movie together.  He is a a very gifted actor for his age and I suspect we will see much more from him in the future.    Buy this movie.  It is a great family movie, and a vehicle to begin dialogue between adults and children about the challenges they face when they leave the protection of their homes.  It is also a movie that will teach all that Kung Fu is not all about swift kicks and throws.  It is a philosophy as well as an art that should be approached with respect and practiced with care.

0393317552|5.0|What a fascinating book this was!  This is the book for you if you have ever wondered how we ever got to the haves and have-nots with respect to civilizations and geographical locations throughout the world.  I know there are some competing theories with respect to some of the specifics discussed and, I suspect, there always will be, but the material is presented with such logic and evidence that I believe the author is surely mostly correct, if not completely so.   This is a book, that if widely read, would help to lessen some of the arrogance and bigotry in the world.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|My husband and I bought this movie after seeing previews for it on other BBC videos.  We also bought it because we enjoy watching Matthew Macfadyen.  We had never heard of this particular Dickens story before, so everything was a surprise.  The story is very well done, and all the actors are excellent in their parts.  From the very first episode (there are fourteen) the mystery and suspense begins.  The characters are all interesting, and you begin to wonder how all of them will connect together--that happens over a slow process through the story.  We enjoyed it from start to finish and felt the glowing reviews here were well deserved.  Some characters you will love, some you will be properly annoyed by, and some you will love.  It took us a long time to view the series, as we could only watch one or two episodes a week.  The first and last episodes are both about an hour long, while the others are only about a half-hour each.    For more details, there are many reviews here which will help you make your decision, but we recommend it for any fan of British period drama.
B0000DFZZC|5.0|The psychologist, Carl Jung described synchronicity as the experience of two or more events that are apparently causally unrelated occurring together in a meaningful manner. This story brings three figures together in synchronicity: Red Pollard played by Tobey McGuire, Charles Howard played by Jeff Bridges, and Thomas Smith played by Chris Cooper. A jockey that was too big (5'7\\"), a trainer too old, a horse that was too small, and an owner too dumb to know the difference. The horse that was too small, at 15 hands, was Seabiscuit.<br /><br />Charles Howard moved west with 21 cents in his pocket as a bicycle salesman who became the richest man in California once he started selling the horseless carriage. The loss of his son in a truck accident and the subsequent separation from his wife change the man's life. He meets a drifter and plainsman who loves horses and understands them. He is Thomas Smith. Together they look for horses to buy, and Smith sees something in the eye of one of them and convinces Howard to pay the $8,000 price. Smith also notices a hot-tempered jockey who was abandoned by his family at an early age. He thinks he will be the perfect match for the horse that slept and ate too much--Red Pollard. The cantankerous two take an instant like to each other.<br /><br />Pollard, Smith, and Seabiscuit are underdogs in the time of the Great Depression where underdogs were something to be cherished and cheered. The bowlegged, graceless horse begins to win race after race and captures the imagination of a nation. The horse that is too short starts to win with a jockey who believes in holding the horse back until it can see the eye of the horse next to it, and then lets him loose destroying the spirit of the competition. Howard decides to push for a match race between Seabcuit and the lord of the east, War Admiral, who at a sleek 18 hands, seems to be an easy winner. Radio announcer \\"Tick-Tock McLaughlin\\" played by William Macy plays up the match race and adds a humorous touch to the movie.<br /><br />This double DVD series is a great buy. The first is the movie, and the second offers: Seabiscuit vs. War Admiral, the 1938 Match Race; Winners' Circle: The Heroes Behind the Legend; HBO First Look; The True Story of Seabiscuit. The photo book contains a few pictures from the movie and should be inconsequential in your consideration. In addition to the superb acting and story line, David McCullough provides an outstanding narration much as he did for the series, \\"Civil War.\\" This gives the film the feel of a docu-drama.<br /><br />This is a story about a horse and people who interacted in a way that gave purpose to each other. There's no handicap in watching this.<br /><br />P. S. It would be nice if all the parts of real life ended as the movie. Howard owned several horses, but none ever achieved the stature of Seabiscuit. He would die in California in 1950. Thomas Smith became the top horse trainer in the country. Red Pollard suffered numerous injuries as a jockey, but one injury led him to fall in love with the nurse attending him. He married her and had two children. He was less fortunate financially as he ended up as a valet polishing boots of other jockeys. Seabiscuit was retired at the age of seven, and sired other horses. Its heart gave way at the young age of 14 and he is buried at an unknown location on the Howard ranch.humorous touch to the movie.<br /><br />This double DVD series is a great buy.

B000V63B5E|3.0|Bon Jovi is probably my all time favorite singer all in all. Even after all these years he still just rocks! This is supposed to be a greatest hits and it does have SOME songs I would list but are missing others that anyone thinking of a Jovi fan would expect to be here. Born To Be My Baby, & Never Say Goodbye Should of defiantly been on this CD. And why is this not remastered? I thought that was standard on all Greatest Hits albums.<br /><br />This is not a bad CD, I don't think any CD that has anything from this guy could be honestly, but it is missing some things that could have made it far better and really, well rock. For the price of it sure is cheaper than buying each song individually so I would go ahead and get it, but if you're like me you will be doing some of your own adding to make this a real Greatest Hits.
B003X8597A|5.0|This is the first performance of Rienzi to be recorded on DVD. Any Wagnerite is going to jump at the chance of seeing it.<br /><br />Fortunately, this is a very entertaining production. Admittedly, cuts have been profound and sweeping; out of the five hour original only 2.5 hours remain. I'm not familiar enough with the full version to comment on whether the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater, but to my ear, what was left was strongly Wagnerian, with none of the fluff described in many accounts of the original. Clearly, the scenes have been selected to match the premise, that Rienzi was a proto-F&uuml;hrer. Again, I don't know whether this is a distortion of the original.<br /><br />The opening scene, where a somewhat acrobatic body double performed during the overture, was reminiscent of Obersaltzberg, complete with panoramic window and Mussolini fireplace, although the director, in the 'making of' interview, claimed that this wasn't intentional. Much use was made throughout of a bi-level stage, with the main action taking place above the lower section - a concrete bunker. There was also copious use of monochrome video, giving a strong flavour of Leni Riefenstahl.<br /><br />Musically splendid, with some outstanding performances. Torsten Kerl was the perfect despot, incorporating many of the mannerisms of those chaps from the beginning of last century.<br />Kate Aldrich, as Adriano was amazing. Just amazing.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.<br /><br />On a second viewing, there was a particularly strong scene where the chorus removed their grotesque masks, and normal street clothes, and replaced them with uniforms, complete with stylized 'R' symbols. The individuals were now identifiable, but made anonymous by the costumes.<br /><br />The more I watch this, the more I like it.

1848566190|5.0|E.T., the Indiana Jones movies, the Star Wars movies, the Back to the Future trilogy, the Goonies, Harry Potter, and Frank Darabont's Stephen King adaptations are all movies that Drew Struzan created all the promotional art.  From the late 1970's until his retirement at the end of 2008, Struzan was THE movie poster artist. His artwork came to define some of the movies he helped promote.<br /><br />THE ART OF DREW STRUZAN isn't a collection or treasury of all of Struzan's movie posters.  Instead, it is more akin to an author's favorites or best-of collection.  Struzan worked on the movie posters and promotional materials for around 200 different films; only 40 are collected here.  In addition, there are a series of sketches, some in black and white others in color, as well as comments from Struzan about each of the movies.  The book contains a forward by Frank Darabont that laments the fall of the movie poster artist and the rise of digital and PhotoShopped posters.<br /><br />The book is a bit larger than an average book, but smaller than most art books.  It's about 9\\"X12\\" in size with a black cover.  The writing is easy to read and a person can read the entire book within a few hours or less.<br /><br />Besides the artwork, some of which hasn't appeared before in the other two Struzan books available, what I liked most about the book was Darabont's foreward and Struzan's comments.  Which is to say, I liked the entire book.  Even though it's a book about the work of a particular movie poster artist, it provides a glimpse into the business side of motion pictures and how that often conflicts with artistic side of the movie business.<br /><br />This is an excellent book that any visual artist or movie fan will enjoy and is almost a must-have for either one.
0312600844|4.0|Freedom is a big book. I liked it, but it is not perfect. Jonathan Franzen presents characters in difficult relationships. I developed an empathy for these characters reading this book.  There is relationship between a husband and wife.  There is another relationship between a father and a son.  There is a relationship between a mother and her children.  There is also a rivalry between friends in this novel.<br /><br />  These relationships are interesting to read, particularly the relationship between a father trying to connect with his son.  I like reading how this relationship develops. The problem I have is that Franzen is too predictable in his writing. I had a feeling of knowing exactly how each relationship would unfold as I read this book.  I do not like this feeling as a reader. I like to have the element of surprise when I am reading a book. The themes of infidelity and sex are two things that make this book predictable.  I don't think Franzen needed to include these elements in his book.<br /><br />Freedom is a central theme in the novel.  Each character is seeking some kind of freedom in this novel. Depression is another theme of the novel. Each character is touched by depression.  Reading about depressed people can be a downer for some readers, but I found it to be realistic and moving. It is uplifting to read how each character works through their depression.<br /><br />Franzen presents characters that are passionate about what they do.<br />I like the character of Richard Katz.  He is passionate about pursuing a career as a musician.  I also like the character of Walter.  He is passionate about protecting birds and the environment.  The dedication these characters have for their work make them interesting to read.  I enjoyed reading Freedom.  It has memorable characters, but some elements of the novel are just not necessary.

B003XUKVXK|5.0|Kenny Wayne hearkens back to his roots here, playing a mixture of blues standards and old KWS favorites, with his trusty vocalist Noah Hunt re-assuming his lead vocal duties after Kenny's latest studio flop, \\"The Place You're In\\". Actually, Noah has to take a backseat for much of this album to make room for the several guest stars, which turn in fine performances, with Kenny's accompanying fat Strat tone searing into the Stratosphere! His tone is KILLER, with plenty of bite and depth! Noah sounds better than ever--really bluesing it up here! Only 2 gripes: 1) Deja Voodoo is performed with a slower, more laid-back, lilting beat than on the studio version, and ehh, just doesn't work, IMO. And 2) They chose to leave off Voodoo Child! The only time he has recorded it in the past is on the flipside of the Blue on Black CD single, which is IMPOSSIBLE to find unless you want to pay a small fortune! It's a personal thing for me, I must admit, as I had the chance to see the KWS band live this past summer, but the concert was cut short due to a lightning storm. I'm pretty sure he would have played Voodoo Child, so I'm still looking for restitution--lol.    A must have for all KWS fans--great sound, too!    EDIT: OK, another reviewer informed me that there is a deluxe edition with Voodoo Child (I fixed my review title accordingly). Hurray, but it ticks me off that I didn't know about before buying the scaled down version CD. Nevertheless, I of course will have to purchase the Deluxe version now...live and learn... :-)    EDIT #2: OK, I got the deluxe edition (hope the record company is happy, I have BOTH versions of this CD now), and the Voodoo Child performance is very good--explosive playing by all involved! However, I think Kenny kind of \\"played it safe\\" during the solo sections with \\"by the book\\" riffs borrowed from SRV's version. I understand that one of his missions has always seemed to be to pay homage to the late great SRV, but I would have liked to see him go out on limb a little more and get a little more \\"crazy\\" with it--kind of put a new twist on it, maybe...overall though, I'm still glad I got the deluxe version, as it also includes a couple of other cuts not found on the standard version (there should only be ONE version, though...come on!).

Love the twist.  The movie was pretty good, but like in most situations, this book was much better than the movie.  Glad I read it first!
0525951652|3.0|Please stop the price-based reviews!  This is not the venue.  I almost decided I had no interest in reading it based on the overall review score being so low.  I'm glad I went ahead and actually read the reviews. The only really negative ones (1-star) are based solely on it \\"costing too much\\" and there are a LOT of them.  Cost has nothing at all to do with the merits of the book! I will definitely be reading it. I gave it 3 stars because I haven't actually read it yet, and that seemed like splitting the difference.
0385342047|2.0|I enjoyed the Shopaholic novels, although I wondered how much lying one character could do in a book.  Well, Sophie Kinsella has taken that challenge and upped the ante in this new tome.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe it's the recession, maybe it's the fact that I've been out of a job for almost two years, maybe it's the fact that I can't stand bratty children, but this was not my favorite Kinsella offering.<br /><br />First of all, it's probably a bit too close to reality.  Becky, her long-suffering hubby Luke, and their two year old monster toddler are living with Becky's hapless parents until the lawsuit from the debacle in the last book is settled.  Becky has managed to take over every spot of space with her belongings, and somehow misses out on the fact that her parents have put their lives on hold while she and her family are there.<br /><br />Second of all, Becky hasn't learned a thing and is now passing on bad habits to a child.  In other words, she is spoiling her child.  Even her husband, Luke, is disturbed by this and wants to seek outside help, a la SuperNanny.  But Becky refuses to see that her child is a problem, most likely because it will reflect badly on her.<br /><br />Finally, she nearly costs Luke's assistant her job, as she pushes her to divulge confidential information.  Again, Becky doesn't think about consequences.<br /><br />Yes, maybe I am over-analyzing chick lit.  Maybe I am expecting too much.  Like I said, it could just be because it's a bit too realistic right now.  I couldn't escape into this world like I usually can.<br /><br />Overall, a disappointment.
0345505387|3.0|The storyline in this graphic novel (\\"comic book\\" to some people) is interesting, and adds new elements previously unheard of in the Outlander series (a new character and Murtaugh-focused sub-plot). However, it's also a little choppy and disjointed.<br /><br />The illustrations are beautiful and sometimes spot-on.  They are, conversely, also sometimes very far off if you're familiar with the details of the series.  For example, Jamie is clearly in the 5'10\\" area in this book, and never appears \\"a head above\\" the other men.  Additionally, it's very hard to follow which man is which, as they are all portrayed almost identically.<br /><br />Having said that, though, I do think it's worth reading, and as a die-hard fan, I believe it's worth owning.<br /><br />One last note: Please don't review with one star just because you didn't know what a graphic novel was.  That's not fair to the author or artist.
044654759X|5.0|Sparks has done it again he has captured my heart and gave me some hope in that women can leave the darkness and start over i love this man thank you for this nick really thank you. The story is written so well that I felt what Katie was going through and I wanted to hold her and tell her that everything was okay and that she was safe. This book is different than his others because the characters involved had to have over come some hard times to get the where the story took place. I'm in love with Alex because he didn't care about Katie's background all he needed was the now I really cared about that because women need someone who will be that person I give it 5/5 because it actually made me cry at the end, and it touched my heart in so many ways. Go and see for yourself because it will change your mind about Nicholas and his type of writing.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|Joe Bonamassa takes off on a tangent with this supergroup. This is NOT the blues-rock that Joe is known for. It's classic-style hard rock, kind of a nu-Deep Purple, if you will. The vocal chops that Glenn Hughes possesses is amazing, not even taking into account that he's almost 60! The guy obviously knows how to take care of himself. Joe's playing effectively displays his impeccable chops, though I would have liked to see some longer solos. However, the vision of the band probably focuses on the songs themselves, and indeed, these are GREAT SONGS penned mostly by Glenn and Joe! Just when you think every great classic-sounding hard rock song that can be possibly written has been written, here come these guys with a bunch more! Well, the last song on the album has a quite lengthy instrumental section, and a lot of it is meandering and boring. At least keyboardist Derek Sherinian gets to take one of his very few but impressive solos of the album during that section. After his solo, Joe takes the spotlight and then doesn't really do much for a while...finally he kicks in with some more shred licks, but overall that instrumental section drags on too long. But other than that, the band FIRES on all cylinders throughout the CD!    Glenn's bass playing is solid, no gripes there, and Jason Bonham lays it down predictably hard and on the money! Perhaps a live album in the future will allow each of them to stretch out and strut their stuff.    The accompanying DVD is, well, about what you could expect from a \\"free\\" DVD. The interviews are interesting enough, I guess--I enjoyed the interviews with Kevin Shirley the most. A little too much footage of them taking a photo shoot--zzzzz. And the concert clip is really lame. It looks like somebody just placed a camcorder on a ledge at the back of the venue and left it there. It's only one or two songs, and somebody really FLUBS one of the instrumental passages with some pretty sour notes during \\"One Last Soul\\", I believe--lol. Kindof surprised that they included that concert clip...the sound isn't very good, it's quite a distant view, they goofed up the song...sheesh! Why bother?    But again, the songs on this CD are fantastic! It's not too often these days that four musicians with top-notch skill put out hard-rockin' music with this much quality. I think that Glenn Hughes overdoes the high-range vocalizing a bit, but hey, he deserves to show off considering how well he's hanging in there! :-)    I would recommend this to any hard rock fan out there, as well as to Joe Bonamassa fans who don't mind him dropping the blues riffs in favor of hard rock shredding!

B00008WT5E|5.0|After watching my AC/DC \\"Live At Donington\\" dvd,I discovered a mistake in the spelling and the pronunciation of the album \\"Powerage\\".I went to the \\"Backstage Pass\\" section,then the \\"Discs\\" section.In the Discs section, Malcolm and Angus give a short,audio commentary about every AC/DC album, up to the \\"Bonfire\\" box set.When they talk about the \\"Powerage\\" album, they pronounce it Power Age,two seperate words!They also refer to the Stone Age and the Iron Age(they even give a Flintstones cartoon reference).We`ve been mispronouncing the album title for 30 years because of a spelling error! As far as the album itself,I agree with a lot of people,that it`s a great,very underrated album.In my opinion it has \\"The Definitive\\" AC/DC sound,my favorite.I disagree with Andrew Mueller`s review that it has no signature song`s.What! Rock & Roll Damnation,Down Payment Blues,Gimme a Bullet,Sin City,Riff Raff,Kicked in the Teeth,etc.,pick one they`re all great!I think Power Age was forgotten by some people because \\"If You Want Blood\\" came out the same year and was so good also,many fans had waited for a \\"Live\\" album from them.

Still, I bought Blu-Ray for simple convenience of having everything in one spot and in high-def.<br /><br />Short short desc of the show: Future. A band of mercenaries flies around in a ship that has a glowing b*tt (thus Firefly) and does stuff for money. Not always nice stuff, and that's your 1st clue that this series is different than usual good vs. bad kind of stuff we get on regular TV.<br /><br />Characters are beautifully created, with stories behind them that you can relate to (well, some of 'em). Story is always interesting and rarely you will look at the first few minutes and say \\"I know how this is going to end.\\". Main character is balancing between goody-goody and ne'er-do-well personality.<br /><br />Somebody already did a great job by doing a review of the series, so I'll keep it short and sweet: if you like UNIQUE and HUMOROUS stuff, here's the best deal you're going to get anytime soon! BUY IT! :D
B0036EH3XE|3.0|This would be a 5 out of 5 if not for Buena Vista Home Entertainment and ABC intentionally screwing up the aesthetics of their individual season DVD set (on the last two seasons) with the hopes of convincing customers to purchase the Complete Series Collection.  Those who loved the show from the beginning and thus bought each season upon its release, were ripped off by non-matching boxes, particularly on the side.  Not only that, after two seasons, the aforementioned companies decided to go without episode guides.  Their intention is obvious and I for one am very upset to have been treated poorly as a customer, simply because I loved the show from the beginning.  It's not so much to ask that the boxes match.    All that aside, the show is one of the best ever, in my opinion, and I'm happy to have each episode on disc (which is ultimately what matters).

B003JLA4KS|4.0|What's interesting is that I am ABSOLUTE Rush fan, yet this film only proved to me what I have suspected about some of the guys in the band for a LONG TIME....  For starters, Geddy is pretty full of himself. One particular comment was about how \\"simple\\" other bands' music is. What he's trying to say here is that VERY FEW bands are on the \\"virtuoso\\" level of Rush's playing. That may very well have been true in the past, but when you listen to Dream Theater, well, so much for THAT opinion.     I've always seen Peart's leaving the band on his \\"soul searching\\" bike ride as entirely self-indulgent - and this story cemented that aspect. Sure, you want to grieve over losing your family members, but FIVE YEARS...???  Just proves how much he loved his bandmates by making them sit by for half a decade waiting for him to decide if he \\"still wants to play drums\\". The excuse that he \\"does not handle fans well\\" that was emphasized in the film, and how Alex and Geddy have to do all the palm-pressing events with fans, sounds just like an EXCUSE to me. I mean, the man is a friggin' AWESOME drummer and a hell of a lyricist, but he ain't no GOD..... And that's the way he comes off to me in this film.    As far as I'm concerned, \\"Hemispheres\\" was their ABSOLUTE ZENITH, musically and creatively. There were a couple decent albums after that, but after Moving Pictures, the band took some (again, self-indulgent) strange directions and let their (then) current producer toy with their sound and make the synthesizers the focal point of the music and not the guitar. HUGE mistake and one that cost them my loyalty, and many other true fans of the band as well. After you've written something like Hemispheres, why in the world would you want to go back down levels to playing drivel....??  Funny how Peart admits in the film \\"After we wrote Hemispheres we decided that was the LAST time we were going to do an album LIKE THAT...\\"  Hmmmmm....  What does THAT MEAN, exactly?    Why would three intelligent men distance themselves so ardently from their finest work..?  One has to wonder sometimes about peoples minds. I for one was never sadder to lose the \\"progressive Rush\\", a band that paved new roads with excellently played, yet melodic arrangements, and odd (yet palatable) time signatures that so perfectly complimented the music.    I know I'll probably get flack for my unflattering opinion of a band so highly regarded, but I'm just calling it as I see it.    I play my \\"old\\" Rush over and over again and as a bass player, I believe myself to be more in tune with their music and what they stood for than the average person. I'll just have to be satisfied that - at least for a brief, shining moment - these three guys shined brighter than most of us mere mortals.    Bravo \\"Hemispheres\\"!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I first saw [[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]] on HBO when it aired in weekly installments. Now on DVD, I have seen the series twice and could easily watch it again. A perfect marriage of education and entertainment, this series captures the spirit and (quite possibly) terror the founding fathers faced in building our nation. Reading dry textbooks about that period, it's easy to forget how unbelievably volatile that period was. That, prior to now, John Adams was lost to the annals of history is a shame, but this 7-hour film is a testament to his beliefs and what he sacrificed to begin a nation anew. If this series doesn't restore your faith in this nation and make you want to learn all you can about civics, I don't know what will. I'm making my way through the book, which--while riveting--is long, and whenever I feel a little bogged down I go back to the DVD and refresh the well.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|The second season of Legend of the Seeker surprised me. I had stopped watching the first season half-way through because it was too different from the books (Sword of Truth Series by Terry Goodkind). It took too many unexplainable leaps in logic under the guise of \\"it's magic, that's why it works\\".<br /><br />I get that things have to be adapted for television and that books are almost always better. But it seemed like he series had little to do with the books other than character names. So I quit watching. And honestly, I was sad to do so. I loved the books and really wanted to like the television series.<br /><br />When the second season came out, I decided to give it another try. Again, I really wanted to like this show. For some reason this second season actually had me hooked. Now that the actors had had time to get into the characters, the characters seemed a little more like what I expected from the books. True, the series took more of the unexplainable leaps. It was also pretty silly at times. But danged if the actors weren't doing a good job!<br /><br />Bridget Reagan is a fantastic Kahlan. While tweaked from the books, she really is the embodiment of the character. Reagan plays her confidently and with a little more depth than the first season. She is the strongest of all the characters in this series.<br /><br />Tabrett Bethell was also a good casting call. She portrays Cara near perfectly. The only issue I have with her is that the powers that be chose to have her out of her Mord-Sith costume (well, partway). I'm assuming that her constant cleavage was to get ratings, as she was almost always in full uniform in the books. I don't know that I can fault them for their choice as Tabrett is a beautiful woman but the purist in me kept nagging.<br /><br />Bruce Spence was a good choice for Zedd, even if the series muddled him a bit to seem too indecisive. Zedd should have been a much stronger character that the show allowed him to be.<br /><br />Craig Horner was probably the weakest of the casting. He originally seemed much too much the kid and the show kind of left me wonder about his motives for being part of this group. (Oh there's bad people? No that's cool, I'll help you out. Oh and by the way, I love Kahlan now. Stop calling me Luke Skywalker Darken, I mean it!) Now the criticism aside, I think he really grew into the role the second season. I was able to start buying into him as a serious Richard Cypher (Rahl). And thank heaven they had him start holding his sword right for the fight scenes instead of the \\"cool way\\" of upside down.<br /><br />For some reason, this season just seemed a lot more fun to me. True, I didn't finish the first season (still haven't) but I watched every episode of this one. I guess like most shows, the production team, director, actors had a better handle of things. Would I have liked the series to follow the books more closely. Hell yes I would have. But even so, the story arcs flowed better and characters grew more believable.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this series, at least the second season. I wish it hadn't been canceled because I had even higher hopes for a third season. Oh well, I suppose Sci-Fi and Fantasy are still a niche type of genre. They really have nothing in common with Law and Order (my God there's a new one starting), CSI: Planet Mars, or So Youth Think You Can Dance with Survivor Stars.ginally seemed much too much the kid and the show kind of left me wonder about his motives for being part of this group.

Shame on you people who gave the author a bad review, not for his writing, but for the price of the Kindle version.     I thought these reviews were for the book itself.    Not pricing.

I actually purchased the full-sized version for easy reading and to keep at home for a reference and the smaller backpacking version to go in the bug-out bag.  This is a book that you'll be glad you own but hope you never have to put to use the many helpful things that will save your life.

B002ZG97V0|4.0|This movie was pretty awesome for anyone who likes cool animation. However it did seem more geared for an older audience. My 3 year old kept asking what was going on and eventually she fell asleep. I give it 4 stars because I thought the animation was mind blowing. It was just visually stunning. I like it enough that I considered taking my daughter back to see it again (maybe the first time was too late of a showing for her).

B00368PSN2|5.0|I was expecting a weak and/or cheesy movie when I rented this but I am a nerd at heart and the whole sci-fi in viking times sounded awesome.<br /><br />I was wrong, not only was this movie great, but the production value, story, sound and picture quality was incredible. After watching this movie I immediately ordered it from Amazon to add to my blu-ray collection.<br /><br />If the synopsis of this film sounds even remotely interesting to you, get it. You won't be disappointed.

I have to disagree with some other posts about the sexual content because I have read much worse in other books and I seriously don't remember any cuss words??    Read the sample before you buy if you are not sure what to do.  I got hooked after reading the sample chapters and knew I had to buy it.  Can not wait for his next book to come out.
B002ZG97V0|5.0|Kludd, Soren and Eglantine are three owlet siblings living in the hollow of a grand old tree with loving parents and a snake nurse maid named Mrs. P. They, except Kludd, love to hear the stories of a legendary group of noble owls called the Guardians The Guardians are well known in stories for protecting  all owls from evil.<br /><br />One day, a brotherly scuffle between Kludd and Soren ends in both of them falling to the ground -- a dangerous place for owlets who have not fully learned to fly. A predator comes to kill them and they try valiantly to escape but can't  they still can't fly. The brothers are snatched up by two large owls and flown far away from their home to the canyons of the St. Aegolius Academy for Orphaned Owls. Here owlets are brainwasked into becoming soldiers.  Soren and his new friends escape to the island of Ga'Hoole, to assist its noble, wise owls who fight the army being created by the wicked rulers of St. Aggie's.<br /><br />This is a wonderful epic story brought to the big screen. It contains heavy violence between owls throughout.  Scenes of owls being snatched away from their homes may be scary to yougn children.  I would think  10 years and older would enjoy this movie more.<br /><br />An accurate rating would be a 4.5 srating.  I loved it and I had tears in my eyes about 8 times!!! Moving, emotional and memorable!!!
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is an intelligent action thriller with mind blowing visuals and a riviting, intense story.    Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb who specializes in stealing information from peoples minds by entering into their lucid dreams and interacting with them in their dream world.    He is haunted by the fact that his wife killed herself and made it look like he killed her, thus he is a fugitve and seperated from his children.    A billionare energy tycoon offers Dom enough money to buy a new identitity in exchange for his services. However instead of extracting infomation, his mission is to \\"Implant\\" an idea in the mark. To create an \\"Inception.\\" But to do so is dangerous. He and his team must navigate through three levels of dreams (dreams within dreams)and the time clock is ticking relentlessly.    Inception is an \\"edge of your seat\\" type of movie. It was intense. I'll look forward to owning it when it comes out on DVD.

B001R4CKGU|2.0|Usually I know I am going to enjoy what Amazon recommends to me based on my purchases.  However, with Paul Harding's \\"Tinkers\\" I could not have been more dissapointed.  Like many of the other reviewers I could not get into this book.  I kept waiting for something to happen.  Something large and grandiose.  However, the beautiful prose only works when it is part of an engaging and thought provoking story.  It is hard for me to believe that this won the Pulitzer Prize and is being compared with Junot Diaz's \\"Oscar Wao.\\"  To me these books are not even in the same league.  I would absolutely skip this one...
0321525655|5.0|People cannot read AND listen at the same time.<br /><br />Rather than presenting slides that are too full of words, show an interesting picture that is (or is not) somehow related to what you're talking about. When your audience gazes at the slide they are still listening to your voice rather than reading the words on your slide! This presentation style is unintimidating and entertaining for the audience; and although it is more work for the speaker, the presentations are more interesting and memorable.<br /><br />Other reviewers gave the book low star ratings, one reviewer saying that she is a scientist and that scientists need presentations that convey scientific data better than PresentationZen allows. I am a scientist too, and she is correct: your slides will not convey the scientific data. That reviewer missed something, however: the SPEAKER conveys the scientific data and the audience listens to the speaker.<br /><br />Garr Reynolds doesn't say to never put words or tables into your slides - the idea is to stop with the persistent (and dull) slides full of the same words that are coming out of your mouth. Doing a hybrid PresentationZen presentation isn't the antithesis to some dogmatic principle of \\"Zen\\" presentations, and you probably won't go to prison if you don't follow this style to the letter.<br /><br />I can understand that PresentationZen is a difficult concept for some. It goes against all the established ideas about PowerPoint presentations, and it is (at first) a lot of work for the speaker. But if you see one or give one, you'll be hooked, especially after all the compliments.
0312600844|2.0|This book is tedious, the characters´behaviors are confusing, and the story sinks after the beginning of Patty´s memoirs (page 25, more or less), as a reviewer has already pointed.  As the book goes on, the story gets even worse and I kept skipping pages. I ended hating the characters, because it was like spending several days locked in a house with a bunch of not at all interesting people talking and talking about their silly issues.    Not a nowdays \\"American Pastoral\\" at all.

1558807381|5.0|Other than Beastmaster, this is my official favorite sword&sorcery movie EVER. EV-ER. The background and sets are LEGENDARY with a look that could still put some modern movies to shame. Legend is the Star Wars of fantasy movies. The Lord of the Rings is about the same but Legend just has that \\"thing about it\\" that makes you like it better. I still say Legend has better backgrounds, sets, colors, costumes, characters, and overall better storyline. This is the best fantasy movie ever. Try it. If you like Narnia or Rings, Legend will knock you back in your seat. Tom Cruise stars in it. Legend will be around for another 20 years and is and should be THE MODEL FOR FANTASY MOVIES FROM THEN AND ON. You simply have to see it to believe it!

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I admit I was skeptical. The title alone had me thinking this would be another Twilight type disappointment and I am a huge fan of True Blood. Vampire Diaries is very well written, well acted and has a great story! I could not get into Twilight as the main girl cast Bella simply cannot act! She could not even cry when the love of her life breaks it off with her? And yes, I did read the books. Anyhow back to Vampire Diaries. There is a ton of Drama, Action and Suspense to keep you entertained. This series stars off at High School but quickly and cleverly steers clear of High School and into more complex issues and problems. I give this five stars as it reminds me a little of Anne Rice but has it's own unique style and again a fantastic well thought out story. Don't miss out without giving this a shot. One episode and you will be very interested. One disc and you will be hooked! Thanks for reading :)

0525951652|4.0|I am sadly disappointed with the boycott that has been created with this book and how it can be given such poor ratings by so many people who have NEVER even set foot in reading it!     Ken Follett has written another winner with The Fall of Giants, the first book The Trilogy Series, which will span the decades beginning with World War One and beyond.     To begin with, The Fall of Giants is not only big in content but a big book in terms of physical size-- spanning 983 pages, this book is a good 1 1/2-2 inches thick with fairly small type font, definitely not something you can hold up with one hand.     In terms of content, Ken Follett does an amazing job of weaving several groups of families together with connections that are not unbelievable-- a nobleman's housekeeper is the daughter of the local miner's union, a German spy is the secret lover of the nobleman's sister, etc. The characters are so vastly different, yet they share so much in common-- the onset of war and the need to fulfill their own destinies. The book follows characters from Welsch, Russian, English, American, Scottish, French, German and Austrian families during pre-World War One and through the War. The book is filled with suspense, action, drama and romance. I was weary of the vast number of characters Follett introduced but he does an excellent job of keeping them in line by clearly describing their connections to other characters and transitioning to different scenes of each character or set of characters that are so vastly unique from their counterparts.     Ken Follett has written many great mystery and suspense novels over the years but I think he has done an even better job with his historical pieces. If you like Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, you will highly enjoy The Fall of Giants. Almost every moment of the book keeps you wanting to turn the page. Follett has does extensive research on every aspect of the culture and political landscape of the decades where the novel takes place and it show through on the pages-- you can see the Welsch mines and the horrible conditions that were once considered normal, the opulent rooms of the nobility and their even more opulent dress as well as the torrid conditions of Russian peasants living under the rule of tyrants.

0307341550|5.0|I'm so bad at review titles. Anywho, I really loved this book. It was a page turner and very dark. Love it.      Camille Preaker is informed of a possible string of child serial murders in her hometown. Being the reporter that she is she is told to go home and, well, report. She really doesn't want to go home. All that's waiting for her in Wind Gap is her dysfunctional family and a small town laden with gossip. (And trust me, they are. I'm from one.)     I think this was a very entertaining read. I loved the mean girls and the gossip and the drama. Hey, it's a small town thing, okay? ;) It took me a while to buy this book.  Sat in my cart for a while.  Thought maybe it was all hype. But no, it was really good. Check it out!

0743277708|5.0|I first read this book as in high school nearly thirty years ago and recently read the book again as a book club selection and these many years later I still found this novel to be one of the most enchanting and mesmerizing stories of the hundreds of books I've read.     This wonderful and poignant adventure of a community of rabbits, uprooted from their warren by human expansion, is simply a classic and I wish I could give it ten stars. Hazel, the leader of this group of rabbits, tries to guide the party of outcasts on a perilous journey to find a new home. Along the way, they face dangers from not only humans but a battle with a nemesis, General Woundwart and his warren.      Richard Adams has written an epic saga of bravery, leadership, danger, and perseverance that touches the very heart of the reader.

0439023513|4.0|I was really looking forward to this one (as was just about everyone else).  While, I wasn't disappointed really, I think it fell short of what it could have been.  But, an author can't please everyone.  And, above else the author most follow how they think the story should go.  I do think I will have to reread this one because there was just so much to digest.<br /><br />There are people who think Katniss acted out of character.  I don't think she did.  She just broadened her goal.  Instead of saving herself, she choose to save everyone.  She knew she had to be the face everyone saw even though she knew she was being used (and I do think she knew it even if she was trying to deny it).  I can't imagine the weight she carried on her shoulders.<br /><br />I was heartbroken with what happened to Peeta.  It's so hard to read when he's so different than they previous two books.  Some things he did and said actually made me wince.  It's no wonder Katniss had such a hard time with everything.  Gale, I'm still not sure on.  I think we get a better look at his character in this time of open war.  I still admire him for all he has done for Katniss.<br /><br />I wasn't surprised that I disliked district 13 almost as much as I disliked the Capitol.  I think they did what they had to do to survive on their own, but I don't think they should have traded one form of total control government for another.  None of President Snow's actions surprised me.  But, I was surprised at President Coin.  Especially at what was proposed for the leaders of the fallen Capitol.<br /><br />I did feel the middle was slow and dragged a little.  And then the ending was rushed.  It all happened so fast.  I don't really think Katniss was forced to make a choice between Gale and Peeta, but had to accept how she would feel about certain events and her own power of forgiveness.  My biggest thing I had to accept was this story doesn't really have a happy ending.  But then again... why should it.

0312600844|5.0|I just finished reading Freedom and although, like some other reviewers, found that it dragged in places, but all in all, it is a towering achievement of fiction writing. The story is complex, funny, profound, moving, and, ultimately, elevating. And what more can we demand from art that suggests greatness? The best art is that which deepens the experience of the reader in his or her own life and I found this to be true of Freedom. Sometimes the writing felt so real that it seemed that I couldn't go on reading, for the pain and suffering in parts of it are almost overwhelming. For me, particularly in Joey's dialogues it acted to revive my own college memories in ways that were visceral. Also, Walter's slow evolution to solitariness and his love for birds, in some ways mirrors my own life.<br />I was very sad when I finished this book, but I am very happy that I read it. Very strong recommended.

Supernatural Season 5 is probably the most seat-grabbing and exciting season yet, not to mention funny. The humor in this show is great.<br /><br />In this season, Sam and Dean Winchester face off against the four horsemen of the Apocalypse as well as Lucifer himself. They have help from Castiel (who really becomes an awesome character in this season), as well as others, maybe even God himself?<br /><br />If you haven't gotten into this show yet, start up with it. If you've been away for a while, come back. This show is awesome!
0393338959|4.0|I had to keep pressing on through most of the first half of this book. But then it happened, the author started to have a few more rational ideas in the second half. I have tried to improve my understanding of liberal ideas on society and especially the \\"blame game\\" of using any political leadership as the bad guy ( liberals blaming Bush and conservatives blaiming Obama) and then it dawned on me.. Take reponsibility for yourself. Yes, neither party is perfect and this author seems to lean left but his economic solutions are pretty sound. Read this book to get a different perspective and it will open your mind a bit. Most importantly, it will make you realize you need to be responsible for you.
0307454541|5.0|My rating should be 4.5 stars or thereabouts if such precision were allowed. On the other hand, this is far from my _type_ of book or series, so that is a very high rating.<br /><br />As usual, I won't do a plot summary or list characters or any of the usual things that gets high helpfulness ratings. I will instead to a general comment on the series that I don't think has been made elsewehre.<br /><br />The picture of Sweden given in this series, which may or may not be accurate, must have, or should have, a profound effect on two groups of politically-minded people in the U.S.<br /><br />For the extreme conservatives who paint Sweden as some sort of socialist demonic realm, it should be quite a surprise to see that Sweden has a market economy. The means of production are, mostly, in private hands. The controls placed by the state on the market may be greater than they are here but they are not onerous enough to stop people from making huge fortunes.<br /><br />For the progressives who see Sweden as an idealized vision of the future, the books should be a big shock. Capitalism survives but that wouldn't surprise them. They know that Sweden talks socialism but does not walk the walk. What would surprise them is that Swedish capitalism can be just as cut-throat and occasionally corrupt as business anywhere else.<br /><br />What is worse is that the advent of a caring state has not solved the problems of male-female relationships and that the system does not seem to prevent abuse any better than anywhere else in the world. And topping it off is a vision of a Sweden where the inner circle of the state's security apparatus can be _believably_ painted as carrying out a horrible conspirancy over many years against an individual whose innocence they knew about.

B000I2JDEY|4.0|Opening in 1962, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? blindsided audiences of the so-called \\"Camelot\\" era: everyone who saw it was shocked by its profanity, sexual content, unrelenting verbal viciousness, and its sharp and unswerving portrait of hidden disillusionment. People who dislike the play--and there are many--tend to describe it as three hours of unattractive people screaming at each other, and it is therefore tempting to think of the play as a critic's darling that lacks popular appeal. Nothing could be less true. The original production ran well over six hundred performances; the play has had two major Broadway revivals to date; it has been performed by virtually every professional, academic, and community theatre in the English-speaking world; and, of course, was translated into an extremely popular and award-winning film. If anything, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is even more popular today than it was when the play opened fifty years ago.<br /><br />The basic story is extremely well known. George (Richard Burton) is an associate college professor; his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor)  is the college president's daughter. They have attended a faculty party and now return home very tired and more than a little drunk. George looks forward to bed and sleep--but Martha informs him she has invited a new professor and his wife to join them for drinks. George is not enthusiastic but he agrees, although he warns Martha not to discuss their son. When Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) arrive, also tired and more than a little drunk, they find themselves an unwilling audience to George and Martha's vicious verbal sparring. They are quickly sucked into the battle, and when Martha tells her guests about her son, George determines to put an end to their verbal games once and for all. But can Martha, their guests, even George survive the unflinching light of reality? The play is extremely, extremely funny in its dialogue, and Albee displays wit that is equal to the likes of Noel Coward and Oscar Wilde; even so, laughter is the rug that is constantly pulled out from under foot to send the characters reeling on their collision courses, and the play itself is dark and painful.<br /><br />Over the years many people have complained about the play's ending, which like such recent films as THE SIXTH SENSE and MULLHOLLAND DRIVE suddenly forces the audiences to question everything they have been told over the course of the entire evening. How much of it was real? The story about the boxing match, was that true? The story about the boy who killed his parents, was that true? The play does not simply end on a note of uncertainty, it ends with a deeply disquieting sense of wonder. Who would put themselves through such a display in an effort to maintain their fantasies and illusions? Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf--afraid to look at their lives in the unflinching light of hard reality? Aren't we all, to at least some degree?<br /><br />There are three fundamental problems with the film.  The first is that it almost entirely misses the humor that is so much a part of the original play, a wicked hilarity that rocks the audience by making them laugh and then snatching the rug out from under their feet by turning the laughter into cruelty and vindictiveness.  The second is that, although they give excellent performances, it does not seem to me that the Burton-Taylor-Segal-Dennis quartet manage to capture the vulnerability that lurks behind their characters' facades, nor does the film completely grasp the play's ultimate pathos.  But most significantly, this is a show that belongs to the theatre, not the screen.  It really does require living, breathing actors on the stage in front of your eyes to bring the story to its full, jaw-dropping effect; without the actors live before you, the thing veers toward a \\"talking heads\\" style.  All of that said, it is nonetheless a stunning effort to capture one of the 20th century's most important plays on film.  Many have described this as Elizabeth Taylor's best dramatic performance.  Perhaps--but if so, Burton is not far behind, and although George Segal is not greatly memorable he is at least adequate, and Sandy Dennis is a knock-out in what could easily be a thankless, unimportant role.<br /><br />The double DVD edition is worth the money only for the audio commentaries; the other bonus materials range from fairly interesting to so-so to tiresome.  But the film itself is near-mint in picture and audio elements (the later a particular blessing, for previous DVD releases have been extremely problematic with sound.)

0316098337|4.0|When Jack wakes up, he's now five-years-old and very excited to be a year older. Ma's birthday gift to Jack is a drawing she has done of him while he was asleep. Jack will hang it up in the back of Wardrobe where he sleeps each night. He doesn't have his own bed, only Bed his Ma sleeps in. The reason is that Old Nick comes almost every night to visit with Ma and makes Bed squeak. Jack counts the squeaks, but stays hidden in Wardrobe because his Ma wants him to. Jack is scared of Old Nick, even though he brings him and Ma things like cereal, pasta and even a truck for his birthday. Jack loves Room where he and Ma lives. They spend their days watching TV, playing games, reading books and doing exercise. Room is all that Jack knows, an 11x11 square where seven-years-ago Ma was kidnapped by Old Nick and forced to live in Room where she eventually gave birth to Jack.<br /><br />Jack loves Room. Ma tells him there is a whole other world, known as the Outside, which he confuses with what he watches on Television. He thinks cartoons like Dora the Explorer and Spongebob Squarepants are real. He doesn't ever want to leave Room because it has everything he could ever need, including his Ma. But Jack knows his Ma isn't happy about being in Room. Sometimes Ma is Gone, where she'll lie in bed, not moving, and won't eat or play with him.<br /><br />Ma tells Jack that they need to escape Room after Old Nick punishes her for something she did that angered him. Ma has a plan to leave Room and needs Jack to be a big boy and help her, because in order for them to go to the Outside, it all comes down to Jack being brave and doing his part for it to work.<br /><br />Room is an emotional, breathtaking read that shows the deep love a mother and child has for one another. I wasn't certain how I would feel reading about a woman who has been a sex slave to a disturbed man for seven years, and her son, who is the outcome of her rape. The amazing thing Emma Donaghue gets across so well in Room is that even though Jack is the product of Ma's abuse, she never, ever regrets having him. Not once did she think about turning away from Jack or hating his existence. Jack gives her the hope and the will to live.<br /><br />Jack is adorable, endearing and smart as a whip. Since Room is from his point of view, we see things through a child's eyes. His entire world is a square box with only the simplest of essentials such as a television, stove, table, chairs etc... to him this is his treasure chest, his playground.<br /><br />The first half of Room is where we see the day-to-day rituals Ma and Jack go through that are interrupted late at night when Old Nick comes to be with Ma in Bed. Jack never witnesses the act Ma endures from Old Nick, only hears the squeaks and some muffles. He knows Ma doesn't enjoy when Old Nick visits, even though she tries to explain to Jack why they need him.<br /><br />The tension builds when Ma decides they must escape, but Jack isn't too thrilled by the idea. Everything comes down to Jack making it succeed. And when Ma and Jack's plan works, the rewards are both wonderful and scary.<br /><br />The second part of Room, where Ma and Jack must become acclimated into society falters somewhat in its telling. Jack's view begins to change, perhaps a bit too suddenly, and at times his retrospectives are too adult like. We see a change in Ma's personality and deeper insight on who this woman was before she was taken. Whereas Ma's only thought in Room was for Jack, now she has more concerns for herself. Because of this, Ma does something that doesn't make sense to me, and is a selfish move on her part, especially since her will to live was because of her son. This motivation left me somewhat confused because it really didn't seem to fit the overall message of Room.<br /><br />I thought I would feel rage while reading Room because of what Ma had to endure, and for Jack, who was basically enclosed in this protective bubble. But Room is not about anger or hate. It promotes love, innocence and joy in all its forms. Jack is all of these things. The bond between Ma and Jack is unbelievable strong. In my mind Room was much like a mother's womb where she keeps her unborn child safe and protected. The scene where Jack escapes is where one can see it as him being born into a bright, new world.<br /><br />Room is a book you'll want to read again as soon as you finish. It's a powerful testament of how love, not hate, can give a person hope, and Ma's hope is Jack. At one point Ma is asked how she felt about being forced to bear Jack. Ma's answer is so very simple and poignant. She says, \\"I felt saved.\\" No hate, only love. Room is a message of love. I simply loved this book and this one that both parents and children should read together. One of the most powerful books I've read this year.<br /><br />Katiebabsrms. Jack is all of these things.

1439181780|2.0|If you have read The Secret you do not need to read this book. I was very disappointed in it as it just says the same thing over and over.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I'm going to check this book out at the local library so Penguin Publishing will get far less money for it.  They aren't penguins they are pigs.
0307594777|3.0|the first book was difficult to get into. The characters are likable but the story moves slow especially for the first 6 to 8 chapters.  The second book so far is better than the first, but definitely not one of those stories that you just can't put down.  I haven't gotten to the third book yet, hoping its better than the first two.
1582701709|5.0|This is my best motivational book. It truly works for me and keeps me focused on the positive. I have given it as a gift at least 10 times. I use it every day and it is so worth having.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|i enjoyed the movie, and i really enyou the music.  i highly recommend anyone that love the movie to buy the CD.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I must admit, I was tempted - just for a breif moment of insanity - since I'd been counting the days until this novel became available.  But, please.....stand together, Kindle-owners, and BOYCOTT this type of greed!  Amazon needs to stand-up for their customers, too.
0312600844|5.0|A wonderful read that is just as good as the praise.  Excellent writing and beautiful storytelling.  An easy five stars.
B0021L8UPS|2.0|This movie has a spooky ambiance, a promising creepy, dark feel. It has great acting on Isabelle Fuhrman's part but after that it all goes downhill. The movie had good potential but the so called \\"twist\\" at the end I have big problems with. It isn't believable or realistic. Let's start with the beginning: Couple adopts a 9 year old girl that is mature, smart and dresses really creepy and old fashioned like an antique doll. The movie is slow and tries hard to be suspenseful but it isn't...it's just slow.      Ester is insane, inhumanly strong and evil yet we learn SPOILER ALLERT=     Ester is a dwarf in her 30's pretending to be a NINE year old girl...um...yeah...believable? NO! Why? Here are my reasons:    1) Even the kind of dwarfism where the person has a body proportioned like a full size human, they still have different facial proportions. An adult dwarf and a normal size child would not have the same facial structure. The reason dwarf actors don't play children's roles in movies is because YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE VERY EASILY! This is why the character had to be played by a child actor because it would have been impossible for a dwarf to look convincing in this role.      2) The skin of a dwarf would still just like a full size woman. She is supposed to be in HER 30'S? How many thirty something women have skin like a 9 year old girl? NOT POSSIBLE! Women have Botox and facelifts and still don't look like they are 18, let alone 9! Even a 9 year old and a 20 year old woman clearly have DIFFERENT skin! I have seen dwarfs up close and their skin ages like every other human. Wouldn't the mom notice that her \\"9 year old\\" has as many crow's feet as she does?      3) Fat deposits. People gain and lose fat as they age and as we know, this isn't always in the best or most flattering of places. A woman in her 30's would have body fat in places where women gain it as we age. Even if women are thin they will usually lose some fat in the face, gain some in the jawline etc.4) Hair. Hair can thin and turn gray with age. Adult hair also has a different texture. So this 30 something woman has perfect skin like a 9 year old, a body that can pass as a kid AND no gray hair or hair loss?     5) Hands. Anyone with kids knows that the hands of a child are very smooth...like it or not there is no hand treatment in the world that will make your hands look like your 9 year old kid! If there was, it would make millions! Even models and celebrities who spend tons of money on their looks still have hands that for the most part, match their age range.      6) Voice. An adult, even a dwarf would probably not be able to sound like a 9 year old. Just like a dwarf and a child don't look alike, they usually don't sound alike either.     Apart from the plot twist not being realistic the movie isn't really scary...unless you are afraid of insane and inhumanly strong knife wielding dwarfs wearing silly schoolgirl outfits! It fails at delivering the scare but it delivers the creepy. Once scene in particular where Ester puts on a much-too-grown-up looking black dress and tries to seduce an adult man, is just GROSS and CREEPY and not in a good way! The movie tried hard to be original and it tried hard to be scary and it failed on both attempts. It had blood, gore and violence but it wasn't scary enough to be a horror flick and it wasn't thrilling enough to be a thriller. After a while, blood and gore isn't really scary especially if it doesn't have a plot to carry it.      This movie made me wish for the good old days...when creepy children and scary music meant that they were possessed by Satan, cursed by some witch, in an evil mind control cult, or turned into zombies...or something that made sense! A knife wielding 30 something dwarf pretending to be a 9 year old so she can kill entire families for no good reason DOESN'T make sense! I give it two stars instead of one because of Isabelle Fuhrman. The other actors were forgettable (the parents were especially bad and wooden acting) but I thought she gave this role 100%. The character of Ester was great, it's too bad the script, the plot twist, the other actors and pace of the film had to suck.     This could have been a better movie with some tweaking. If she was a 25 year old masquerading as a 13 year old girl that MIGHT have been a little more realistic. 9 and 30 is just too much of a stretch. They might have also wanted to PICK A DIRECTION with the script. If it's a thriller, it needs better suspense, better plot and less gore...If it's a horror movie it should have crazier gore and a more sinister, scary plot twist with some really dark evil stuff thrown in for good measure. A 4'0 tall psychotic adult just isn't that scary. Also, gore is only scary if it's SHOCKING! It isn't shocking when it is overused, especially when the pace and the plot isn't there to back it up. The person who came up with this story was either really stupid, has never met a real dwarf or just didn't think of all the HUGE HOLES in the script that make no sense at all!
030726999X|5.0|I hated to finish the last book in Larsson's trilogy, knowing there would never be a fourth or fifth, etc. In each of the books, Larsson continued to unwrap the layers of Lisbeth Salander's psyche to reveal her motivation. All three books are very good reads as well challenges.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Received item in less than a week and was in the stated condition.  Would order from seller again.
B0043RSIUK|4.0|I just bought the kindle version for $9.99.  So I'm assuming that all the previous reviews of complaint about the price worked.  Thank you.    Looking forward to a good read!
B001NLKT60|5.0|A superbly crafted second installation to the series - this one picks up where the first novel left off and weaves a new tale of intrigue, suspense and mystery. Elements from the past are craftily incorporated into the plot, and the reader discovers a rich and dark history behind the character of Salander.<br /><br />I felt that in some ways, this one did not have the same cultural impact, historical landscape and quirkiness of the first novel; it was a more straightforward underworld crime thriller. The action kicked off fairly early in the piece, and I felt that the writing was done in a way which artificially creates suspense - especially during the huge chunks when Salander is conspicuously absent and resolutely refusing to talk to anyone (apart from some cryptic messages).<br /><br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed it immensely - 5 stars from me!
B003TEO3EI|5.0|This albim has to be one of the best yet. I personally enjoy this type of music for it's creative influence of storytelling and orchestral backgrounds.  I would strongly recommend this album to anyone.  As far as the product itself, top notch arrived swiftly and in great condition and had no problem at all.
0307346617|1.0|I did not enjoy this book; I wanted to but instead I had to power through it waiting for something interesting to happen.  It never happened.  WWZ is unfortunately monotonous.  It's a bunch of short stories that really don't tie together and as soon as the action starts - the story stops - and goes to next chapter (each chapter being a new person in a different country)  Each CHAPTER  Page 1-2 (plot, character, stereotypes)  Page 2-3 (interview questions, character looses individuality and becomes interchangeable)  Page 4 (character begins to talks about experience with zombie)  Page 4.5 (onto next story)    I guess I wasn't a big fan of the interview style of writing, nor was I impressed with any of Brook's characters.  That combined with the lack of actual action left me dissatisfied.  As soon as the zombies come into the story -next chapter!    I guess Brook's point - we're all the same and boring except for a few stereotypes.  I think he was trying to hard for the political undertones he forgot to make the stories interesting.  I would have preferred some action out of a zombie anthology.  [There were two chapters that I thoroughly enjoyed, but combined they were about 20 pages of the 300+ total]    This book was on the top of everyone's zombie lists so I was very interested from the start.  What a disappointment.  I had read Brook's 'Zombie survival guide' and was mildly entertained so I took everyone's suggestion on reading WWZ.  Oh, well.     My suggestion - if you're a zombie fan and prefer a story - \\"day by day Armageddon\\" was entertaining.
0385335997|5.0|I was looking for a series that would make me stop rereading Twilight series for the 10th time, I admit I have another obsession.  Don't know how I found Outlander, but it certainly has filled my desire for characters with lives I can escape into.  Second in series was hard to get through, I just didn't care about French aristocracy.  To demonstrate my deep obsession with these characters, as ordering next three, read author's page in Amazon and wept with joy to see there is a movie in the works.  Thank you Diana Gabaldon.
1400049628|2.0|Interesting topic but just not a fan of the bullet point style of writing.  Basically saying, this book literally could've been a list of do's and don'ts regarding a zombie attack instead of ~200pgs.  I was expecting more based on the reviews, a lot more.   He spends a lot of time analyzing dumb weapons you shouldn't use rather than playing with it more.  I could see where he was trying to be funny or satirical but he only hit the mark with me a couple times.  The other times I was just rolling my eyes.  I just think this could've been so much more, bummer!  After reading this everyone recommends WWZ, don't bother, I gave that one star.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This is not a review of the movie, which I enjoyed, but a review of the Blu-Ray offering. I just bought a Blu-Ray player and got Avatar because it was visually stunning and I thought it would show off the new player. The movie looks great but there is no BDLive content, special features, or extras of any kind. I was disappointed with the lack of any features besides just the theatrical release. If you want to own this movie, wait for a more feature-rich version.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I loved Dawson's Creek growing up and when I found out the same producers were doing another show, I was intrigued. I am above the target age group for this show, but it is very well written and I was sucked in! The casting is great, the soundtrack, the whole atmosphere of the show is excellent. The vampire aspect of it is not the focus. The focus is the relationship of the characters and I am hooked.
B000N3ST7K|5.0|Essentially this is a 60s compilation but like few that you've ever heard. Here are my top six tracks (difficult as there are many fine ones). (1) Death Proof has breathed new life into 'Hold Tight' and opened it up to a whole new audience. It took DDDBM&T 40 years to appear on a soundtrack & how did these guys not hit it really big in the USA? By the way thankfully the 1966 version that Tarantino has utilised is superior to the 'Remind' partially re-recorded 1991 one. (2) 'Down In Mexico' by The Coasters was the real discovery. Had never heard this before & brilliant in the scene where the lap dance is done. Some fine percussion work. Another reason why so many rate this band. \\"He wears a red bandetta and plays a mean piano\\". (3) 'Riot In Thunder Alley' by Eddie Beram which also had never heard before...an instrumental with great drumming & fits in well in the film. Apparently when released back in 1962 it sold about 500 copies. Brilliant. (4) April March and the sexy melodic 'Chick Habit' - French original from the 60s was by France Gall written by Serge Gainsbourg - the catchiest number here - you'll leave the cinema singing this. (5) The solid/heavy 'Baby Its You' by Smith (more suitable in the context of this film than Dave Berry's version). (6) The larger than life 'Jeepster' by T.Rex which adds a different touch. Of the others then there's a superb start with 'The Last Race' by Jack Nitzsche, which catches your attention well as we begin the ride. 'Staggolee' by Pacific Gas & Electric is really excellent & could easily qualify for the best here on another day, the soulful 'The Love You Save' by Joe Tex plus two gentle instrumentals 'Paranoia Prima' by Ennio Morricone & 'Sally & Jack' by Pino Donaggio which in the context here each really fits in well. After 'Hold Tight' then Pino's track is perfect. There's another soulful number 'Good Love, Bad Love' by Eddie Floyd which serves as a fine introduction to 'Down In Mexico'. The 3 spoken excerpts add something special amongst all these. Finally Willy De Ville's 'It's So Easy' which is ideal for this soundtrack as you imagine Kurt Russell performing this. Tarantino & his musical supervisor Mary Ramos really know how to put a soundtrack together. The mix of pop, soul, orchestral, rock & spoken pieces all makes for a listening experience that you'll never tire of - really great. This review has been done listening to both the CD & the splattered blood red vinyl LP.
B00004YLIU|5.0|As for whether or not the album itself is good...well, read the mountains of acclaim it has from every music critic on Earth.     As for the RECORD...it's great quality. The only snag is the size. I'm not sure why this is ten inches instead of the usual twelve, but there's not much you can do about it, and it's worth buying, anyways. Just need to fiddle with your tone-arm a bit to keep it from splattering on the platter.
B0038QGXHW|3.0|We all love Haden and Jarrett.  Sure, no record they ever release will be \\"bad\\".  But if this were released by anyone else, it just wouldn't have attracted any attention.  Treat yourself instead to profound, tender, tough piano-bass duets and buy Laurence Hobgood and Charlie Haden's \\"When the Heart Dances\\" instead, and support a small label that makes every release count (Naim).

0399536108|5.0|Just got my copy of The Art of NonConformity in the mail and I must confess, I spent an entire lunchbreak (and early afternoon) out in the park, skipping work, to read Chris Guillebeau's fantastic book and life manifesto.<br /><br />Absolutely, stunningly inspiring. Anything I write here is just a small snapshot of the elegance in prose that is Chris Guillebeau's writing. I am so inspired by his clarity in personal vision. It's hard to find people who have distilled the basic tenants of life into such (seemingly) simple ideas and questions.<br /><br />The book makes me want to burst out of the office and start painting humongous signs on it with my personal vision and life manifesto.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know: Chris is a traveler, writer, and fearless entrepreneur whose missions are, among others: to travel to every country in the world, live an unconventional life, and give away as much knowledge as he can - for free. Two of his manifestos are A Brief Guide to World Domination and 279 Days to Overnight Success. I highly encourage you to take a look at them. And be prepared to take steps towards becoming awesome.<br /><br />Chris reminds us to take our dreams seriously and to challenge the conventional by asking what it is we truly want out of life. You can't make something out of your life, he says, unless you know where it is you want to go. So: what do you want from your life?<br /><br />The brilliance of Chris's writing is how easily he puts into words the most essential of life questions. The book is not long. The ideas are not in themselves hard. And, he's refreshingly honest: the hard work is up to you. If you have figured out what you want (This may take some time, too - most people have not stopped to ask themselves this first fundamental question), you must be prepared to work hard and be exceptionally determined in order to get what you want.<br /><br />Chris takes a minor tangent in Chapter 10, \\"Contrarian Adventures,\\" that perhaps wouldbe better suited as the launching point for a different sort of book; I would have preferred to go straight from \\"Radical Exclusion\\" on to \\"Your Legacy Starts Now,\\" because the momentum of the finish was diverted for a few pages.<br />Possibly my favorite passage from his book:<br /><br />\\"... the world needs people who fail to conform and refuse to settle. Without the determined efforts of unreasonable people, most of the rest of us (including the \\"reasonable\\" people) would be much worse off. Martin Luther King Jr. was quite unreasonable to suggest that all free men and women in America should be treated equally. Gandhi was quite unreasonable to suggest that India should shake off the chains of colonialism from Britain.<br /><br />Innovation comes from entrepreneurs and others who are willing to accept risk and try new things. Improvements in social justice come from those who question authority. Being unreasonable or impractical, in other words, doesn't sound that bad to me.\\" (Dangerous ideas, page 222)<br /><br />In the end, Chris defines World Domination as \\"The convergence between getting what you really want while also helping others in a unique way.\\"  His manifesto to you? Decide to be remarkable. The best part about figuring out what you want? Your talents are probably helping other people in a unique, outstanding way.<br /><br />Because the 'Art of Nonconformity' is simple:  \\"You don't have to live your life the way other people expect you to.\\" And when you live your life unconventionally, chances are, you'll be a lot more inspirational. Because you'll be yourself, at your best.
B001TW68P4|5.0|I have a lot of Turtles Albums and this one is by far the best sounding of all. The quality of the sound makes all the Songs even more enjoyable.  Every song sounds so much better than it was even it the sixties. I would recommend this Album to any Turtles fan looking for better quaility Recordings.  Because it was the sixties that most of the songs were recorded in i don't think that you can get anything better than this Album.
B003QTUQGU|4.0|Tim Burton's telling of this marvelous tale, which would have been more fittingly titled \\"Return To Wonderland\\" is truly a visual masterpiece! The combinations of live action and computer animation were brilliantly executed to create this Burtonesque rendition of Wonderland. Quite a wonderfully strange film that I will definitely visit again.
B003INBOEM|4.0|This is a very nice collector's edition blu-ray of Ip Man. The picture quality is great, plus the TrueHD surround sound you can hear every punch and hit that Donnie Yen lands on his opponents. The bonus features disc really is a bonus.

B003UYUQZW|5.0|In my opinion, yes. A BIG Budget Live Action Disney film with big stars such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Kingsley. A Jerry Bruckheimer production. Phenominal special effects. What's not too like?
B0024FAG6M|5.0|This is a no-brainer:    This BD of \\"EASY RIDER\\" trumps any other version on home video before it. The image quality is beautiful and the sound is excellent for this film. This is a very impressive BD and I know that if your considering on purchasing, you will not be disappointed with it. Comes in the book-style case with essays and photos.    Even if you've already got the excellent DVD version, you owe it to yourself to drop the $30.00 for this BD now before it eventually goes OOP and eBay sellers force you to pay 5-6 times more for it.

B0044430H8|1.0|Let me state that I USED to love NIN...I am a huge fan of film scores ie Herrmann, Thomas Newman, Danny Elfman, Alfred Newman, Ennio, etc...<br />Bernard stated that a score must be musically meaningful heard alone, and to fit what's onscreen!<br />This did neither! It was annoying, distracting, no soul, no emotion, no tension, no angst reflecting that billions can not reclaim your lost love, etc.<br />I'd rate this a -5 if allowed!  Very good film...one of the worst scores I've EVER heard!!!<br />A 7 year old with Reason or Massive who watched 7th Voyage of Sinbad or The Crow once could do a better job!!!<br /><br />I expected something cool and cutting from Trent-what a draggggggggggggggggggggg!!!

B003ELKNHM|4.0|I'm not going to review this album because plenty of other people on here have done so already. I just want to mention that for some reason on the new Special Edition of New Jersey the left & right sound channel have been swapped. I'm not sure if this is deliberate or a mistake. It doesn't ruin the listening, but if it is a mistake then it's a bit sloppy for the record company not to notice this before putting it out.
B0000028M7|5.0|`Dirt' was the record that put Alice In Chains on the map and it is a fitting contribution to the grunge era. It may also be the movement's heaviest and most metal statement to boot. Described as a loose concept album about the death and destruction caused by drug addiction, `Dirt's seemingly takes on a number of topics yet it can be agreed that many of them are unrelentingly brutal.  \\"Them Bones\\" is a killer metal song and opens the LP like a sledgehammer. Other standouts include \\"Rooster\\", \\"Down in a Hole\\", \\"Damn That River\\" and album closer \\"Would?\\" all written for the most part by Jerry Cantrell with some contributions from the other band members. Layne Staley also contributed some sole credits of his own such as \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Hate to Feel\\" (whilst in the middle of his own battle with heroin). Many of these songs became classics of the `90's and truly mirrored the drug culture of the Seattle music scene. AIC had gotten some early exposure touring with Van Halen (an odd combination) but would soon be headlining after the monster success of this doomapolooza. Other grungers may have more critical clout or commercial success (namely Nirvana and Pearl Jam) but nobody was bleaker. This was Alice In Chains' `Master of Reality'....it does get any darker than this.
0553805371|4.0|Unless you are a major science aficianado, this book will be difficult to understand.  However, I still enjoyed reading it and got the basic premise.
0765348276|4.0|Short Review:<br />A good fun read throughout, but while the ending is definitely adequate, if you're reading it in digital format and don't realize you're near the end, you might be shocked as it wraps in just a few pages.
1401300529|5.0|The Coldest Winter is outstanding, a fitting capstone to Halberstam's career, as the Korean War foreshadowed the Vietnam conflict. The book, however, is about much more than the war on the ground. It's an all the more relevant work because it explains the relationship between the United States and China.    The United States was happy to walk away from Korea with a stalemate, and to forget the war as best it could. In contrast, the Chinese viewed the Korean War as a proud and successful conflict that helped to mark a break between the old and new China.    How relevant is the Korean War to today's Chinese leadership? Does it have more meaning for the Chinese people than it does for the United States? The Chinese lost somewhere around 500,000 men in Korea, more troops than the United States lost in World War II. Even allowing for the fact that China has approximately five times the population of the United States, that's a huge number.    [...]
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Another Kindle and Follett lover who would rather wait than pay $20 for the Kindle edition.  You guys at Penguin need to wake up and pull your head out, realize the mistake you're making pricing the Kindle crowd out of the market.  So stupid.
0061714372|5.0|Just like the title says, this is the best book I've read. I'm a huge Megadeth/Metallica fan, and it's great to be able to see one of my biggest inspirations as more than just an incredibly talented guitarist and songwriter. This book really gave me inspiration in the sense that if you seriously want to be great and famous, and are really determined, anyone can build themselves out of nothing into a king. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and the only disappointment I have is that I got through it too quickly.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Love every track on this album and that's hard to find.  I usually like a few songs but this album is so good, I enjoy the whole thing...Alicia Keys is a fabulous talent and I enjoy her very much.
B003UYV08E|5.0|better than the first movie. more of everything, action, better visual and sound effects. very enjoyable. i really recommend to everyone in every age.
B0000042H4|5.0|I am incredibly satisfied with this recording. Being a Chicago native, I've been a fan of Solti for a very long time & his conducting of the Ring cycle is absolutely sensational. The big orchestral & brass phrases are breathtaking & overpowering while the quiet sections are nuanced & deftly handled. The vocal performances are fabulous & really bring you into the story despite my sketchy knowledge of German. The recorded sound is excellent. I thought a performance of this age would sound tinny on my iPod but the sound is pure & balanced. All in all, worth every penny & an incredible introduction to Wagner's Ring.
B003U0AHBO|2.0|In terms of scope and detail this movie is second to none. And I generally enjoy this genre of films, which includes classics like BRAVEHEART, ROB ROY, and THE LAST SAMURAI. Having successfully cloned SPARTACUS with GLADIATOR, Director Ridley Scott asks Russell Crowe to clone BRAVEHEART. It's not a very successful procedure, though Crowe's performance doesn't disappoint. He's an excellent Robin Hood. If there had been an excellent script, this would have been a memorable film.<br /><br />A kind of prequel without an original, ROBIN HOOD tells us the story of Robin Longstride, a common soldier in the army of Richard The Lionheart. Returning from the Holy Land after ten years of bloody crusading, the English army is raping and pillaging its way across the French countryside when Richard is killed in a skirmish. In the ensuing chaos, Robin assumes the identity of a dead English nobleman, Baron Locksley, and brings Richard's crown to the tightfisted miscreant King John.<br /><br />Disappointed of a reward, Robin decides that he's for the noble life anyhow, and travels to the Locksley Estates, where he is quite impossibly allowed to take up Locksley's identity, with Locksley's wife Marian (Cate Blanchett) as an added bonus.<br /><br />In the meantime, King John is overtaxing the barons, who want him to sign the Magna Carta. The barons decide to revolt. At the same time, the French decide to invade England to do a little despoiling of their own. A civil war breaks out, quickly followed by a French invasion. Robin Hood is the great unifier of men.<br /><br />It all sounds good, but it doesn't work very well for a number of reasons.<br /><br />First and foremost, this film isn't about Robin Hood. It's about a man who eventually becomes Robin Hood (the closing sequence of Robin fleeing to the forest ends with the splash, \\"The Legend Begins\\").<br /><br />The film fails to spark the emotions, because the story never makes a connection with the viewer. This is a film about nobles fighting nobles. Robin Hood should be the defender of the common man, stealing from the rich to give to the poor, but the common man hardly makes an appearance, except in backdrop, while villages are being burned, for instance. Other than that, Robin the supposed nobleman is fighting for the landowners.<br /><br />Even Robin Hood's grand speech about \\"Freedom and Justice Under Law\\" is delivered to the barons who are angry at King John rather than to the commoners who do their fighting for them.<br /><br />The action sequences are gripping, though we've seen archers and cavalry and catapults and castles being stormed in BRAVEHEART and other films. The French invasion (complete with LSTs) is a sort of D-Day in reverse, and while its a well-crafted battle scene, I found myself not much caring who won the day.<br /><br />ROBIN HOOD lacks humor. There's no wit or repartee between the characters. That would seem to be an integral part of the Robin Hood legend.<br /><br />There's no swashbuckling romance. These Middle Ages are dreary. ROBIN HOOD has no knights in shining armor (just dirty clothes), no damsels in distress (Maid Marian swings a sword), no glittering banquets (rats scurry among the dinner dishes), and no sense of adventure (just a bloody, violent and terrible war). Considering that the Robin Hood tale is a legend, the producers could have had some fun with the story. It didn't have to be \\"realistic.\\" All in all, Errol Flynn did it better.<br /><br />Crowe is dynamic as Robin Hood, and Max Von Sydow is excellent as old Baron Locksley, but Mark Strong is too predictable as the Franco-English villain. Cate Blanchett does her usual impersonation of a bloodless corpse as Marian.<br /><br />In sum, it all fails to inspire, and inspiration is the coin of the realm in this genre. We're being shortchanged.he defender of the common man, stealing from the rich to give to the poor, but the common man hardly makes an appearance, except in backdrop, while villages are being burned, for instance.

B003S6T62Q|5.0|Joe is one of the most underrated talents. Joe can sing/sang and can play guitar. his band is on point. the material live is on point. i've seen some of his other shows on video and this one is the best one yet. great price and you get his jams.<br /><br />bro man is very soulful.  he hasn't gotten his due as a artist.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|The e-books pricing from Penguin is a disgrace. $20? More expensive even than the hardcover?<br />Everyone must boycott their books until they come to their senses.<br />Sorry that this is going as a review of the book, because it is not, but authors too need to step up on this situation.
1423113497|5.0|This is a GREAT book. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is a kid who thought he had dyslexia and ADHD. But, after a couple harrowing experiences, he learns that he has neither. Rather he's a demigod with a mind hardwired to read ancient Greek and keen senses that help him in battle. This is an excellently paced adventure fantasy that is on track to becoming one of my favorites.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who liked Harry Potter or Artemis Fowl.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Bourdain gives us a view into his history and his kitchens and the fantastic characters who dwell in each place.  All the stories are putatively true, but Bourdain is potentially something of an unreliable narrator.  It's not so much that he's lying to you, but it's more the sense that all the stories are so good, so perfect, and so over the top that you can't help wonder if the truth is being stretched here and there for the purpose of making the tale that little bit taller.      This is all a backhanded way of complimenting Bourdain, so let's be direct with the praise: Bourdain is a wonderful storyteller. His anecdotes are clever and well-crafted, and they keep your attention and keep you moving from tale to tale.  You get a feel for the life of a line cook -- of the preparation and the pressure and the ways in which people successfully (and, more often than not, unsuccessfully) attempt to cope with the lifestyle.  You hear about the cons played on the unsuspecting and inexperienced owners, exploited by those in the know for whatever can be wrung from them.  And you wonder a little bit if you're getting a bit of the same treatment in your role as the reader...    Ultimately, though, all is forgiven because of the sheer entertainment value of those stories.  For me, I'd give the book 4.5 stars if I could, mainly because I'd like a little more big picture than what Bourdain gives.  He compellingly describes the trench warfare of the line -- the day to day tactics of it all -- but skimps on the overall strategy of the restaurant business.  It's there in bits and pieces, but doesn't get the comprehensive treatment of, say, the preparation of a mise en place.    But if you let that little gripe prevent you from purchasing the book, then you're making a mistake.  Kitchen Confidential is worth your time and money.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am always very cautious when buying a CD online, because I am always fearful that it will be scratched up or something.  But this product was still wrapped, just like it said it would be.  And it was in great condition! I love Wicked so much and I bought the soundtrack because I am going to see the show next month.  If you love musicals, you will love Wicked!

0385736002|5.0|I am a freshman in college. In high school I never read the assigned books, but rather sparknoted them. This book was recommended to me by a friend and not 100 pages in I was hooked. For me to want to read a book really says something. It was a page turner, and I could never put it down. I ended up reading all of the books in one day each. Even if you aren't in to mythology (which these books are packed with), it is simply an interesting and creative storyline to keep teenage readers to young adults sincerely interested. I recommend to anyone who even remotely enjoys fantasy books.
B003EYVXYQ|5.0|Romero is far for being dead, not even a living-dead, his work is just as accurate as it was in the 60's, 70's or any decade he made a movie in. The blu-ray is full of great features, really interesting.

B002ZG9846|3.0|After hearing good reviews of this movie I decided to buy it as a surprise for my girlfriend. This is a review for the movie not so much for the packaging.   I like the outline of the story. It has it's funny moments, but corny as well. Was it intentional for Mr. Cage to talk as if he were Adam West(Batman)? That didn't bother me. What really bothered me was the sexual content. No nudity, but there surely wasn't any honorable courting being done by the young main character and his dream girl. I can almost live with the little girl swearing worse than a pirate, but is this the kind of stuff you want your children to view as a good role model? The action portion was good. And the ending... made no sense to me. Yes, I know there will be a sequel. Read on. I didn't care for the taking of Hit Girl and placing here into a school. Was this film purposing trying to give \\"homeschooling\\" a bad name?  It also doesn't make sense to put someone outside of the system and put them in it. I bet they never thought about that.   In short, if you are looking for cheap ADULT entertainment flick, this will suffice.   I wouldn't look for this to be any good moral teaching masterpiece so keep your young one's eyes away.     P.S.  I am not a prune nor do I have any children. I just prefer good acting and action without the invasion of perversion with language and sexual innuendos.     Take out that boning in the alley scene and my review most likely would have jumped up a star or two.
044654759X|2.0|I was so looking forward to the next Nicholas Stark book.  I ordered it way in advance.  I have read all of them.    This was not my favorite.  It was not the usual Sparks book.  Every other book of his I have enjoyed immensely.
B0034G4OWM|3.0|I had taken my grandson to see this at the theater and followed up with purchase of the movie for him because he liked it, especially the variety of animals in it. A few mildly amusing parts.  Some of the gags were just overkill to me, gross and not especially funny, (being sprayed by 20+ skunks) and a couple of the characters, especially Brendan Fraser's boss, tries to be funny but doesn't even rate a laugh.  Pretty mediocre stuff.
